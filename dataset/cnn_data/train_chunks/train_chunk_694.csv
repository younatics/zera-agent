Country music superstar Brad Paisley and his actress wife Kimberly Williams-Paisley admit they were taken in by a con artist pretending to be the mother of a little girl dying of cancer. The celebrity couple spent 10 days convinced they were emailing, texting and in Paisley's case singing to a girl named Claire who had deadly brain cancer. Along with the Paisleys, a Wednesday Nightline segment uncovers a slew of other celebrity victims of the hoax including reality star Kate Gosselin, hosts of ABC's Wipeout John Henson and Jill Wagner, and some Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders. Scroll down for video... Duped: Country music star Brad Paisley and his Father of the Bride actress wife Kimberly Williams-Paisley say they were taken in by a con artist claiming to be the mother of a girl dying of cancer . According to Williams-Paisley, who made her name as the the bride in Father of the Bride, the hoax began slowly and very convincingly. 'She said that her daughter had begged her to get in touch with me,' she tells Nightline. Shocked: Williams-Paisley, who now appears in Nashville but may be best known as the bride in the film Father of the Bride, was among a long list celebrities who were apparently taken in by this con artist who said her daughter suffered from neuroblastoma, an often fatal form of childhood brain cancer . It was in an email the actress received from a woman calling herself Carrie and claiming her daughter had end stage neuroblastoma, an often fatal pediatric cancer. 'Well, to be honest,' the email reads, 'with all the chaos and excitement that ensued with Claire coming home from the hospital with hospice. I forgot.' Williams-Paisley, who now appears in . the series Nashville, says the hoax was convincing because it didn't . initially ask for anything or seem all that interested in her as a . celebrity. 'It sounded . very sort of real,' Kimberly said. 'But she wasn't dying to get a hold . of me. You know, that was kind of the beginning of the manipulation.' For ten days, the couple exchanged dozens of emails, texts, and phones calls according to ABC News. The . con artist even sent a journal entry in what appears to be children's . handwriting. From the entry, which is filled with apparently fake . spelling errors: . 'My kim . I am not scard to die now you filled up my heart with so much love I am . sad to leve you because no body can make me smile like you do.' A smiling sun is drawn in crayon at the bottom: 'love your claire.' Brad Paisley even got on the phone and sang a Amazing Grace to what he thought was a dying child. 'You're . singing to someone's dying kid,' he says. 'And in the middle of it, . there's no way that's not real. How can that not be real?' Celebrity victims: Among those who were tricked by the woman, who called herself Carrie Kahler in letters to the Paisley's, were hosts of obstacle course game show Wipeout John Henson and Jill Wagner . Wide net: The band Little Big Town was also conned by the woman, who Nightline says they tracked down to a campground in Wyoming . The couple only became suspicious once the so-called little girl died and, in an angry email, the mother refused to give them an address where they could send flowers. 'Every red flag went up': Paisley says he even sang Amazing Grace on the phone to what he thought was the little girl over the 10 days it took them to realize they were facing an attempted scammer . 'I don't need you to pray for me. Doesn't seem like god hears much of anything these days,' she wrote. They were shocked. 'I had a physical reaction,' Kimberly said. 'Every red flag went up that I couldn't ask a simple question.' In an episode to air Wednesday, Nightline speaks to the couple, whose ordeal ended there. But the worst part, they say, is that the woman used photographs plucked from a website of an actual little girl dying of neuroblastoma. 'That's the sickest part about this to me,' Brad said. 'That is the part that when I start to talk about that, that's when I get really mad. That there were real kids, that there were real photos involved.' Nightline also describes a laundry list of other celebrities who fell into the hoax: reality star Kate Gosselin, Wipeout gameshow hosts John Henson and Jill Wagner, some Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, and singer Natalie Grant, and the band Little Big Town. They also tell their story of tracking down to the woman behind the hoax to a campground in Wyoming. 'We all were devastated by it and it's so disturbing that someone was claiming the identity of a little child with cancer and tried to pass it off as her child,' Natalie Grant tells Nightline.

Benson broke into her estranged husband's home on July 7 with a gun and a metal baton and threatened to kill him if he didn't give her $30,000. Court: Anna Benson made a plea deal in court today which consists of 15 years probation and psychiatric treatment for 90 days (pictured in court on August 2) Prison has clearly taken its toll on Anna since her time in jail over the past four months (pictured in court on August 2, left, and at a Las Vegas club before the arrest, right) She plead guilty to aggravated . assault and gun possession but prosecutors have dismissed the burglary . charge and aggravated assault charge for her plea at Cobb County .

Her . psychiatric therapy can range from anger and violence management, . substance abuse and post traumatic stress disorder therapy, her attorney . Ashleigh Merchant told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. If . she goes five years without committing another felony or violating her . probation which restricts her from coming within 500 yards of her . husband, or threatening him and their children, then the second five . years of her probation will be unsupervised. If she keeps within the terms of those 10 years, the final five years will be dismissed. Kris Benson wanted a harsher sentencing and did not want the court to accept the plea deal. Mr Benson filed for divorce from Anna in March 2012, but it has not yet been finalized. Listen to Kris Benson's 911 call: . The . Baseball Wives star was also charged with the murder of a man in . Tennessee in 1996. She was on the run for five months and though the . charges were later dropped. Benson's . attorney asked for $50,000 bond as well as an ankle monitor and . psychological treatment after her arrest on July 7. But Judge LaTain . Kell denied this. 'Despite the Court’s order that . Defendant vacate the marital residence, she allegedly returned to the . home with a handgun, ammunition, a knife, and a metal baton and . threatened her estranged spouse and demanded money from him,' Kell wrote . in his decision. Arrested: Anna Benson, the estranged wife of ex-baseball pitcher Kris Benson, was arrested on July 7, 2013 . 'There was no evidence presented that the domestic . circumstances which preceded these alleged events have changed.' Officers . arrived at the 1160 block of Drewsbury Court to find Benson, star of . the VH-1 reality series, Baseball Wives, wearing a bullet proof vest and . an ammunition belt containing several rounds. She . had a Batman knife in her waistband, a police-issue baton in her hands . and a revolver in her purse, according to the incident report, obtained . by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. The . 911 call made by Kris Benson was later released and the Mets pitcher . sounded calm as he quietly told the operator he is hiding in the . basement. 'She told me to go get a lighter for her to smoke a cigarette,' Mr Benson said in the 911 call, which was released by TMZ. 'When I left the room, I just did a beeline for the basement.'

He then fled the house and hid in his neighbor's garden until police arrived. When the 911 operator asked him what his wife had said, he explained that he had managed to record her. Mr . Benson also appears to stifle a shocked laugh when he explains that his . 'soon to be ex-wife' was wearing a bulletproof vest when she allegedly . threatened him. Mrs Benson however, told the New York Post last month: 'I would never hurt [Kris]. I am still in love with him.' Rocky relationship: Kris Benson and his wife Anna have filed for divorce at least twice since they married in 1999 .

She added: 'We have been married for 15 . years, and he can’t keep it in his pants. He can’t stop f*****g my . friends, in my house. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t love him.' When police arrived at the scene, she yelled that her husband was a 'f****** p****'. She was made temporarily famous by VH1's 'Baseball Wives,' a 2011 reality show that was cancelled after only one season. Mr Benson pitched in the majors for five teams - including the New York Mets - from 1999 to 2010, when he retired. He married the former exotic dancer and model, at the start of his major league career in 1999. The couple have had a rocky relationship, including bouts of cheating and more than one divorce filing. In 2006, Mrs Benson filed for divorce after she allegedly caught her husband cheating on her with one of her friends. The couple, who have three children, . decided to  stay together- even though she had . famously told Howard Stern that she would sleep with the entire Mets . team if he ever cheated.

Council officials have banned a jolly lollipop man from giving children high fives after receiving a single complaint  that he was holding up traffic. Parents in Warrington, Cheshire, say they are 'outraged' at the way 62-year-old grandfather Steve Allsopp - who recently suffered a stroke - has been treated. Mr Allsopp is so popular with children he has been nicknamed the 'jollyman' and has worked at the crossing on Bridge Lane in Stockton Heath for four years. Scroll down for video . The 'jollyman': Parents from Cobbs Infants, Broomfields Juniors and St Monica's Primary schools say they are 'outraged' at the way Steve Allsopp (pictured) has been treated by Warrington Borough Council . But the father-of-nine was left 'visibly trembling' last Wednesday after he was told by Warrington Borough Council to stop dishing out high fives. Clare Phillips, who has a daughter at Cobbs Infants School, said: 'We were coming home from school on Wednesday afternoon and you could tell straightaway that something was up. 'He is normally so full of life but he looked shaken and was visibly trembling. When he told us what had happened we were all outraged.' The grandfather-of-14, from Latchford, Warrington, has been has been heavily involved with charity work following the death of his 14-month-old daughter Gaynor in 1974. Two years ago he published a book called Steve the . Lollipop Man and the Adventures of the Greenfly Villagers to raise . money for charity. Mrs Phillips said: 'The kids all love him and always want to stop and have a chat with him come rain or shine. Support: Mr Allsopp is so popular with children he has been nicknamed the 'jollyman' 'They are used to having a high five from him when they cross the road. A lot of them have been upset by it all.' Parent Barbara McCoy said Mr Allsopp - who has also been told not to speak about the complaint publicly - deserves as apology for the way he has been treated. The mother-of-two said: 'He was sadly missed when he had a recent stroke and his colleagues were not a patch on him. I hope he gets an apology for this.' Parents have launched a petition asking . for the banning of high fives to be reinstated, calling it 'a ludicrous . example of political correctness gone mad'. Mr Allsopp has worked at the crossing on Bridge Lane in Stockton Heath for four years . Mother-of-two Joanne Higgins said: 'I never felt like it was causing any health and safety problems. 'The kids looked forward to it so would always cross the road with Steve, which is the safest place for them to cross.' A council spokesperson said: 'Steve is a very popular local figure and he works at one of the busiest school crossing sites. 'At any one time he might be assisting twenty children and parents to cross the road. 'While Steve does an excellent job of being friendly and helpful during his work, his training emphasises the need to avoid or minimise distractions, and he fully understands the need to put road safety first, including while he's standing on the pavement.' Mr Allsopp's case follows a lollipop man being banned from high-fiving school children by council bosses in Berkshire who said it 'confuses drivers'. In July, Roger Green was told that he cannot greet pupils from Sandy Lane Primary School in Bracknell, with the gesture because a driver said it slowed down traffic. Parents reacted angrily to the ban by Bracknell Forest Council some have complained to the school. Last month another lollipop man in Devon quit his post after he was threatened with suspension for high-fiving school children by council bosses. Bob Slade, 65, had been a crossing patrol supervisor outside the Manadon Vale primary school in Plymouth, for four-and-a-half years. But the former dockyard worker resigned after Plymouth City Council said he would be suspended for four weeks for high-fiving children - which they said was a safety concern.","Steve Allsopp was told he had to stop by Warrington Borough Council .

A new £2 million sewage treatment plant is turning our waste into a sustainable source of environmentally-friendly fertiliser that experts claim could help secure future global food supplies. The nutrient-recovery reactor, the first of its kind in Europe, is producing high-grade phosphorus-based fertiliser from the 'unique' waste water coming out of Slough, Berkshire. Phosphorus is a key ingredient in fertiliser and vital for the growth of crops but its cost has increased by 500 per cent since 2007 as the availability of mined phosphate rock dwindles from non-renewable reserves. A Thames Water spokesman said the UK uses 138,000 tonnes of phosphate fertiliser a year, all of which is imported from abroad. But the new reactor will produce 150 tonnes of its phosphate fertiliser - which the company has described as 'Viagra for plants' - every year. New technology: The new £2million sewage treatment facility in Slough, Berkshire, which provides a sustainable source of environmentally-friendly phosphate-based fertiliser . Thames Water believes the fertiliser could help boost crop production and secure future global food supplies. The spokesman said: 'Mineable reserves of phosphorus, in countries like Morocco, the US and China, are set to be completely depleted in 100 years, according to some experts, while others say ""peak phosphorus"" will occur as early as the mid-2030s, after which it is expected to become increasingly scarce and expensive. 'This adds to the costs, not to mention the reliance on external sources for such a vital resource, which is used to produce all food consumed by human beings.' Peter Melchett, policy director at the Soil Association, said: 'With the world's affordable mineable reserves of phosphorus set to start running out in the next 20 to 30 years, this new technology could offer a solution to securing global food supplies over the coming decades. 'Without fertilisation from phosphorus, wheat crop yields will fall by more than half. Meanwhile, as the planet's population is predicted to hit nine billion by 2050, demand for food will increase. 'Sustainable alternative sources of phosphorus, like this reactor at Slough sewage works, are vital if we are to keep pace with this demand.' The water company spokesman said nutrient-recovery facilities are ideally suited to industrialised areas such as Slough. He said the high-strength organic waste coming from the Slough Trading Estate, immortalised in the BBC television series The Office, was rich in the nutrients ammonia and phosphorous. In demand: The new plant is expected to produce 150 tonnes of phosphorus-based fertiliser every year . He said this causes struvite, which is a rock-like scale on pipes at the sewage works costing Thames Water £200,000 a year to clean. The facility, built by Vancouver-based Ostara Nutrient Recovery, makes the phosphorus form into struvite in a controlled setting, before turning it into crystalline fertiliser pellets. The company markets this under the brand name Crystal Green, which it says is cleaner than any similar product on the market with lower heavy metal content. The spokesman said: 'The new reactor will also improve the quality of treated effluent leaving the sewage works, reducing nutrient levels and in turn reducing algae growth in rivers and streams, which can suck oxygen out of watercourses leaving little for fish and other wildlife.' Piers Clark, commercial director for Thames Water, said: 'This is a classic win-win. We are producing eco-friendly steroids for plants, while also tackling the costly problem of struvite fouling up pipes at our works. 'The cash and carbon cost of digging phosphate out of the ground in a far-flung foreign clime then shipping it back to Britain makes no sense when compared to the local, sustainable process of our reactor in Slough. 'As we gain experience with this new technology, we intend to evaluate its suitability for installation at other Thames Water plants in the UK.' He added: 'Slough has taken some stick over the years, from the likes of poet John Betjeman and Ricky Gervais, but this scheme is rebranding it as an eco-warrior at the forefront of the global effort to save the planet.' Phillip Abrary, president and chief executive of Ostara, said: 'This new facility is a model for sustainable innovation in the UK and indeed across Europe. 'Removing nutrients from where they shouldn't be - in our waterways - and using them to create a new generation of enhanced-efficiency fertiliser is the smart thing to do economically and the right thing to do environmentally.'","The nutrient-recovery reactor, a first of its kind in Europe, is based in Slough .

Tasteless: 22-year-old Alicia Lynch posted a picture of her Boston Marathon victim Halloween costume last week, sparking outrage across twitter . A Michigan woman has been fired from her job and subjected to vicious cyber-bullying after causing an uproar online by posting a photo of herself at an office Halloween party dressed as a Boston Marathon bombing victim. Alicia Ann Lynch, 22, sparked an outrage by donning the insensitive costume consisting of athletic gear and fake blood smeared on her face and legs. 'And the most offensive costume at work goes to...#toosoon?' she wrote. Her Twitter account, @Some SKANKinMI has since been suspended. Since posting the picture, users on Twitter have come after the 22-year-old, calling her an 'absolutely disgusting human being' and saying her costume was 'insensitive, low, [and] heartless'. Even one of the Boston Marathon victims, Sydney Corcoran, tweeted at the woman for her outrageous costume. '@SomeSKANKinMI You should be ashamed, my mother lost both of her legs and I almost died in the marathon. You need a filter.' Lynch's social media faux pas got her into more trouble when users discovered that she posted her driver's license online with the address clearly visible. Exposed: The blog EveryJoe.com has since unearthed nearly two dozen photos of the Bay City, Michigan, resident posing nude . Backlash: Lynch, pictured in selfies posted on her social media pages, said she has been let go from her job and targeted by bullies threatening to kill and rape her . 'I forgot you can anonymously send s*** (literally, s***) through the mail. I think @SomeSKANKinMI can expect a delivery' a user named Mark wrote. The blog EveryJoe.com has since unearthed nearly two dozen photos of the Bay City, Michigan, resident posing nude or in little more than her underwear. The X-rated images and videos had been originally posted on her Tumblr account, which has since been shut down along with her Twitter and Facebook pages. In some of the photos, the young brunette is seen topless or covering her breasts with her hands. At least one of the images depicts her naked buttocks. 'You need a filter': The bombings at last year's Boston Marathon resulted in the death of five people. One of the victim's of the bombing tweeted at Lynch saying she 'should be ashamed' In response to the abusive comments, Lynch tweeted: 'Plz stop with the death threats towards my parents. They did nothing wrong. I was the one in the wrong and I am paying for being insensitive.' For a while, Lynch took down her Twitter but then briefly reopened it in an attempt to apologize once and for all about the costume. In addition to a simple 'I'm sorry' tweet, she also said: 'I have been fired from my job. I am paying for what I thought was a simple joke. I know it was wrong now. I wasn't thinking.' Crossing the line: Lynch said she has been threatened with rape, which hits close to home since she was sexually assaulted last fall . When the backlash continued into November, many Twitter users started speaking out against the hate messages directed at Lynch. User @HannahBuhnanz said that she ran the marathon and knows that 'angry responses are exactly what fueled the bombings to begin with.' 'You guys, stop,' she wrote. 'Cyber bullying another human being is not going to undo her actions. She has apologized.' This week, she sent a message to Buzzfeed, which originally reported the online outrage, to once again apologize for her actions. 'It seems as though my outfit was too . soon, and will always be that way, it was wrong of me and very . distasteful,' she wrote. 'My costume was not meant to disrespect anyone, . ever. I am truly sorry to anyone that I may have offended or hurt with . this. I know my apology doesn't ever fix anything that has been done, . but at least know that I am being sincere. I can't undo my actions or . make up for them, but my apology is a start.' In a strange twist, Lynch said she didn't post any of the apology tweets when her account was briefly reopened. 'I . had apologized a few hours after posting and the apology went to deaf . ears and blind eyes, so I had deleted all my social accounts,' she said. 'It seems someone is trying to look out for me and help me make things . better, which I also great appreciate.' In her interview with BuzzFeed, Lynch said she had received voicemails containing threats on her life. ‘They . want to slit my throat and they want to hang me and tear off my face,’ she said, adding that her friend was told by a stranger that ‘they’re . going to blow up her house and hang her child.’ However, . the 22-year-old said the threats of rape were worst of all since she . was the victim of a sexual assault last Thanksgiving. Contrite: Lynch has apologized multiple times on Twitter and to Buzzfeed for the inappropriate costume . Gender card: Lynch said that if she were a man, she would not have been judged as harshly for her poor costume choice . ‘When people bring up the rape stuff, it kind of hits a spot, but I don’t show it. I’m over it, but it’s something that I would never, ever wish upon someone no matter what they had done. They can dress however they want.’ Lynch played down the enitre incident, calming that her intent was simply to celebrate the Day of the Dead by being ‘funny.’ ‘I was a survivor of a marathon,’ she said. ‘And it’s not like I was walking around with a fake leg or my arm torn off or something like that.’ Lynch said that before donning the outfit, she ran the idea by the father of a friend, who ran in the Boston Marathon, and he was not offended by it. The 22-year-old also insisted that if she were a man, she would not have been judged so harshly by her critics. Going forward, Lynch sounded confident that she will have no problem finding a new job even if a potential employer decided to look up her name online. 'I have nothing to hide,' she said. 'It happened, I made a mistake. I just have to learn from it. I’m not a terrible person.'","Alicia Ann Lynch, 22, of Bay City, Michigan, became the subject of cyber-bullying campaign after posting a photo of her costume on Twitter .

A cyclist says he was treated like a 'burglar or child batterer' by police after he was arrested for riding his bicycle without lights. Edward Copland, 38, of Blackpool, Lancashire, was stopped by officers as he cycled along the pavement on his way home from working as a shop manager. Police said he was taken to the police station after becoming abusive and . then held in the cells before being charged and bailed over long-standing laws on the time of day a bicycle should have lights. Now the Crown Prosecution has thrown the case out in a hearing that lasted just two minutes. 'I was treated like a burglar': Lytham Road in Blackpool, where Edward Copland, 38, of Blackpool, was stopped by officers as he cycled home . Senior Crown Prosecutor Alison Quanbrough told magistrates at Blackpool just before Mr Copland was due to enter a plea: 'I am somewhat surprised to see this allegation in court today.' 'I do not believe it is in the public interest to continue with this prosecution and ask to withdraw it.' Justices agreed and defence lawyer Steven Duffy said: 'That is a common sense approach by my colleague - greater common sense than was shown when my client was arrested and then processed through the custody system in the cells.' A police spokesman said the cyclist 'became abusive towards the officer and refused to give his details'. File picture . Mr Copland called the arrest, which happened at about 7pm on Tuesday October 29, a 'waste of public money' adding: 'I was treated like a burglar or child batterer. 'OK, I did not have my lights on and would have admitted that. 'I was cycling home in the rain after a busy day. I had forgotten to put the lights on my bike because the clocks had changed that weekend. 'It was a mistake but I found myself being treated like some master criminal on a major drugs deal.' 'I had reason to believe the police were over the top arresting me when a caution or fixed penalty would have done.' 'I suppose they did not like it when I asked them ""haven’t you got anything better to do?"".' A police spokesman said: 'Mr Copland was stopped on Lytham Road in Blackpool for using a cycle without lights at night. 'He subsequently became abusive towards the officer and refused to give his details and he was therefore arrested and later charged with the offence.' He added that Mr Copland was held for an hour. Mr Copland added: 'I was perhaps a bit sharp but it did not warrant me being taken off the streets and processed through the custody system. 'I was told by one custody officer in the cells there were 25 others awaiting processing and I would be 26th.' 'It's not been a great time for me as I have just been laid off by the shop.

Miss Langford's father Martin, who was flying in the U.S. at the time of the atrocity, said: 'I didn't know anything about it, but I'm not happy at all. 'She knows I'm a pilot and that's not cool at all. We will be having a little chat, I think.'

Patricia Bingley, 79, whose 43-year-old . son Kevin Dennis died in the atrocity said: 'It's hard to understand . where they've come from to do this.' Mr . Dennis was working as a bond trader on the 101st floor of the North . Tower when a plane struck the skyscraper on September 11, 2001. Miss Langford, who is studying biology at the University of Chester, . and Miss Collinge, a criminology student, wore the outfits to a Halloween event at Rosies nightclub last Thursday evening. Pilot: Miss Langford's father Martin, who was flying in the U.S. on 9/11, said he was 'not happy' They had modelled their costumes on the North and South Tower wreathed in flames and with victims jumping from windows. Both women also wore hats topped with the wreckage of the planes and U.S. flags. The widow of a 9/11 victim living near Chester said she was 'angry and disgusted' at the girls' outfit and suggested that they were ignorant about the true horror of the terror attack. Liz Gilligan, whose husband Ron was working in the World Trade Center at the time of the atrocity, told the Chester Chronicle: 'I can't begin to tell you how angry and disgusted I am. 'These girls and Rosie’s need to be made aware that 9/11 was very real and while it was 3,000 miles away, it affected people on their doorstep.' Some clubbers were so disgusted that they tried to complain to management. 'I . was completely outraged,' said 20-year-old George Borsberry. 'Not only . were they labelled the ""best dressed"", but they were also given £150 to . dress up in this way and mock the victims and the families of the . victims. 'We asked to see the manager to complain and was turned down due to him being ""too busy"" to see us. 'After . waiting two and a half hours to see the person who decided this . dreadful winner all we got was, ""Sorry but it was a good costume."" 'He . then had the audacity to say there were people in other disgusting . costumes such as Jimmy Savile, as if to justify that it was alright to . dress like that.' Outrage: Relatives of 9/11 victims have spoken of their anger at seeing the teenagers' costumes . Students: Miss Langford, left, and Miss Collinge, centre and right, are both studying at the University of Chester . Others took to the club's Facebook page to vent their anger about the decision to give the teenagers a prize for their outfits.

Tasteless: Annie Collinge took this picture of herself as she was getting ready for the party . Millie Robinson tweeted: 'Can not actually believe that some people went as the Twin Towers blowing up on Halloween.' John . Feal, founder of the FealGood Foundation which supports 9/11 victims' families, told The Sun: 'The insensitivity level for this act of . ignorance is topped by none. 'As for the nightclub who allowed it, sponsored it and endorsed it, shame on you.'

Jez Arthur, 21, a third year psychology student added: 'They're a pair of numpties aren't they? 'If they had such a costume they should have kept it for a private party rather than going out and parading it in front of cameras.

Ally Mullany died 'almost instantly' after her car crashed into an oncoming fire engine that was responding to another nearby accident . A headteacher was killed when her car crashed into a fire engine after veering into its path while taking an unfamiliar diversion, an inquest heard. Ally Mullany, 50, died almost instantly when her red Mini Cooper ploughed into the 15-tonne vehicle that was on its way to another fatal accident nearby. Mrs Mullany from, Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, was driving two of her children to a horse riding competition when she was forced to take the route near Wareham, Dorset. But after straying onto the other side of the road, the married mother-of-four crashed into the oncoming fire engine. The inquest was told the incident occurred as the fire crew was responding to a radio call alerting them to another road accident victim on the A35, who died after crashing into a tree. Firefighter Andrew Cobb, the truck’s driver, said the vehicle was travelling at around 36mph with blue lights on when he saw Mrs Mullany's car drift into its path. Mr Cobb said he made a 'split second decision' to avoid any collision by swerving onto the opposite side of the road. However at the last moment the car veered back onto the correct side of the carriageway, leading to the head-on crash. Mr Cobb said: 'As I came over a hill I saw a car gradually come into our lane until it was almost fully on the wrong side of the road. 'I made a split second decision to go round the vehicle. 'I was hoping we would be able to pass each other or just clip but at the last moment the car driver swerved back to the left and we collided.' Mrs Mullany's car veered into the path of the oncoming fire engine as she followed an unfamiliar diversion near Wareham, Dorset . Mrs Mullany was driving her 11-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son to a horse riding competition at nearby Bovington Saddle Club when the accident occurred. Both children were injured and taken to hospital after being cut from the car by firefighters, but have since recovered from their injuries. Mrs Mullany was the headteacher of St Joseph’s Catholic Combined School in Poole, having previously worked in London and Singapore. A post mortem examination revealed she suffered a fractured skull due to 'massive cerebral trauma'. Mrs Mullany was forced to take the unfamiliar B3075 as the the A35 near Wareham, Dorset, had been closed . Bournemouth coroner Sheriff Payne ruled Mrs Mullany died as the result of a vehicle collision. He said: 'Sadly the impact appears to have been caused by driver error on the part of Alison Mullany. 'For some reason she failed to negotiate a left hand bend that was presented to her. 'It was a tragic accident. The only benefit that has come out of it is two of her children survived the incident and were not more affected.'","Ally Mullany was driving two of her children to a horse riding competition .

Many British singletons struggle to find love, but for many men in China the task seems insurmountable, due to a severe shortage of women. Thirty years of China's one-child policy, coupled with a cultural preference for male children, led to mass abortions of girls. As a result, by the year 2020 it's predicted there will be 24 million men with no partner. Li Dongmin, 39, and desperate to find a wife, epitomises the plight of China's unwanted bachelors. He is a migrant labourer from a tiny village 1000 miles from Beijing. Marcel and Li Dongmin, one of millions of lonely bachelors looking for love across China at a singles event in a Beijing mall .

The latest Channel 4 Unreported World . sees Reporter Marcel Theroux and director Frankie Fathers join some of .

It follows two characters that represent the contrasting paths to love in modern China. Marcel and the 'love hunter' Rong Na in front of a Chairman Mao statue . In the village where Li Dongmin grew up, his mother weeps as her neighbours laugh at her son's inability to find a bride. Theroux accompanies Dongmin to one of Beijing's unofficial marriage markets in the Temple of Heaven Park, where parents tout for potential suitors for their adult children. Dongmin suffers a stream of rejections from openly contemptuous parents: he's too poor, he’s insufficiently educated, and he has no property in Beijing. Unreported World also follows 30-year-old Rong Na, an elegant and vivacious ‘love hunter’, employed by an agency called Diamond Love and Marriage to find wives for some of China's richest men. Rong Na combs Beijing's shopping malls for attractive women, picking potential wives for a client she refers to as Mr X, who’s very rich and can afford to be extremely choosy. She declines some women for being ‘too average,’ ‘too common,’ ‘too short,’ having eyes that are ‘too droopy’ or for not walking ‘like a university graduate’. Pale skin is deemed the height of beauty, as are Westernised facial features, such as a small pointy chin.

The birth of a much-wanted child is always a special occasion but for Justine Smithies, 41, the birth of her second grandchild proved more memorable than most. For the last time a grandchild of Justine's came into the world, she was still trapped unhappily in the male body she was born with. Sadly, Justine's joy at becoming a grandmother again and at finally completing sex change surgery was tinged with tragedy, as just months ago, her 15-year-old son, Cameron, lost his life after falling from a cliff face. Happier: Justine, 41, (left) and partner Julie, 39, were thrilled to become grandmothers for the second time . Commitment: Julie is Justine's former wife and the pair hope to remarry once the government's new same sex marriage bill is enacted . 'We are overjoyed,' said Justine, who lives with her former wife and partner of 22 years, Julie, 39. 'We think our son Cameron is watching over Harrison. He would have been made-up to be an uncle again.' Tragically, Cameron fell to his death the day after predicting that his sister Samantha's newest child would be a boy. Marine electronics engineer Justine, who . also has another daughter, Morgan, 12, with Julie said: 'I remember . Cameron saying, ""It's going to be a hyperactive ginger boy"". 'After his passing we took Samantha to get a scan and that's when they told us that it was a very active, wriggly boy. 'It . was as if Cameron had really known. All that was left was to discover . was his hair colour. Well now he's here and his hair does have a ginger . tinge.' The couple, who hope to remarry under the UK's newly introduced same-sex marriage bill and live in Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, already have a granddaughter, Harmony, two. 'Though my surgery earlier this year to become a woman made me feel complete, even when Harmony was born I saw myself as female,' explained Justine. 'I was always granny to her. Both my grandchildren have brought happy tears to my eyes - there was a time, as a man, that I never ever thought I would be able to be my true self.' Throughout her challenging transgender journey Justine has had the support of her partner and their children, after finally revealing her need to be female five years ago following a lifetime of silence. Cameron's death just weeks after the surgery, and Harrison's birth, has seen their strong family bond blossom further. Cameron had been thrilled to learn his two mums planned to remarry under new same-sex laws and said he wanted to walk them both down the aisle. Happy family: Justine with daughters Samantha and Morgan, granddaughter Harmony and new baby Harrison . Courageous decision: Justine first told her family about feeling trapped in the wrong body five years ago . And his 19-year-old sister Samatha adores them just as much, as does Samantha's partner, Shaun Donaldson, 22, with whom she lives in Peterhead. 'Harrison's birth wasn't easy,' Samantha said. 'The cord was presenting first. I had to have an emergency caesarean and was scared for his life and my own. 'Both my mums were there for me. Justine and Shaun were at the hospital, Julie looked after Harmony. 'Only Shaun could go into theatre with me. I was in tears when I said goodbye to Justine. She was scared and nervous, too. I felt Cameron with me then.' But all went well and Harrison was born weighing 6lbs 13oz. Samantha said: 'I think Cameron was watching out for him, giving him that extra chance. New arrival: Justine's much-loved grandson, Harrison Donaldson, has ginger hair like his Uncle Cameron . 'We have a wonderful family and I've never been so proud of my parents. They have been through more tough times than most people, yet they still love each other. 'It's great having two mums. I can talk to them about anything and we're all over the moon that we have Harrison.' The Smithies are now making plans for Christmas. Justine said: 'It is going to be hard without Cameron but we'll still celebrate it and talk about what he would have done or said, funny or sad. 'We'll never forget him. Samantha and Shaun and will be at ours with the children for the festivities. 'That's what families do. We love them all.

When it comes to feeling the pressure to lose those extra pounds ahead of summer, it is not just women feeling the heat. According to the latest research, almost half of men claim they diet in preparation for a holiday. According to the survey over a third of men say they feel stressed at the thought of having to show their body on the beach. The terminator: Nearly half of men are embarking on pre-holiday diets to shape up and vote Arnold Schwarzenegger as having a great beach body . The pressure proves too much for some, . with 10 per cent admitting to the drastic action of cancelling a . holiday, or staying in the UK, because they just couldn't bear to bare. Surprisingly, just 5 per cent of women polled said that they had taken . the same action. Peer pressure and the views of others are the main reasons for men feeling uncomfortable with stripping off, as over a quarter of men polled said they worried others would judge them. Almost a fifth said they didn't want to be reminded of their appearance in holiday photos when back on these shores. Other results from the survey showed that it's not just other men that blokes look to compete with, as over one in ten say they pit themselves against their partner to see who can lose the most weight ahead of going on holiday, while just 7 per cent of women admit to comparing themselves with their other half. With the pressure from celebrities, and partners higher than ever, it's no surprise that half of men now feel as much pressure as women to diet and stay in shape. Are they crazy?

The research shows that poor quality or inadequate sleep can effect many different aspects of skin cells . It is well known that sleep is essential for health, with lack of shuteye associated with everything from weight gain to cancer. But now research has proven the long suspected link between insufficient sleep and accelerated signs of ageing. The study, conducted by University Hospital Case Medical Centre in Ohio investigated  the impact of chronic lack of sleep has on skin function and appearance. They found that poor quality sleepers lost 30 per cent more water 72 hours after a skin barrier disruption, such as exposure to UV light than those who regularly have good quality sleep. Crucially for women concerned with the signs of ageing poor sleepers had twice the amount of intrinsic signs of ageing such as fine lines, reduced elasticity and uneven pigmentation, as well as recovering slower from sunburn. They also reported less satisfaction with their skin's appearance and had a dulled skin sensory response. Further breakthroughs for the importance of night time repair of skin comes from cutting edge research from scientists on the process of Catabolysis. Dr Nadine Pernodet, ‎Executive Director of Skin Biology Research at Estee Lauder explains: 'Catabolysis is a natural purification process that helps skin cells eliminate internal debris that can cause cellular damage.' It is getting older coupled with environmental stressors that generate this internal debris within cells, which can cause cellular damage and prevent cells from functioning effectively. Sleep is essential to skin repair which keeps it looking youthful and even . Skin cells, like the entire human body, have a natural 24 hour rhythm, repairing themselves at night and protecting themselves in the day. The research, commissioned by skincare brand Estée  Lauder, is the first to show that Catabolysis is at its peak at night in line with the circadian rhythm of our bodies and that as you age, the process becomes less efficient and desynchronised with the night. Healthy skin cells maximise natural repair at night and thus suffering from chronic lack of sleep will negatively effect your skin. Sleep expert Dr Guy Meadows from www.thesleepschool.org debunks some myths ... How much sleep do you actually need need? The average amount of sleep people need to wake up feeling refreshed and to cope during the day is 7-8 hours. Genetic variation means that their are long and short sleepers and so sleep needs can range from 4 to 10 hours. Genetics also determine the time that you sleep such as whether you are an owl or a lark. Women are three times more likely to suffer from poor sleep than men (75 to 25 per cent). Can you train yourself to have less sleep? Contrary to what many people believe you cannot train yourself to need less sleep. People who believe they need more sleep than they actually do and spend to long in bed could be weakening their sleep quality. For these people, paradoxically decreasing the amount of hours spent in bed could help to improve depth and quality of sleep. What are long-term effects of not enough sleep? Research tells us that good sleep helps to protect your immune system and prevent you from getting coughs and colds. It helps you to eat healthily and lose weight by regulating the hormones that control appetite. It also regulates your daytime mood and so helps you to combat feelings of stress, anxiety and depression more effectively. Good quality sleep is also the answer to youthful looking skin by lessening the formation of wrinkles and preventing acne. In the long term, good quality sleep has been shown to limit your risk of conditions such as heart failure, Alzheimer's, diabetes and cancer. The fear of not sleeping drives us to stop living our lives such as avoiding going out at night with friends or sleeping in the spare room . What are your top tips for the perfect sleep? 1. Let go of the props – sleep is a natural physiological process that can’t be controlled and trying to do so by engaging in unnatural rituals or becoming reliant on props (e.g. warm baths and milk etc) can lead to further sleep anxiety. Follow a normal wind down of turning of the TV, getting ready for the next day, brushing your teeth, washing your face, reading in bed if you want to and then turning out the light. To achieve your best nights sleep you should limit alcohol consumption, especially close to bedtime . 2. Be mindful – Worrying about past poor quality sleep or imagining how bad things will be in the future if we don’t sleep only helps to increase night time arousal levels. Mindfulness grounds us in the present moment by noticing things objectively and without judgment and as a result can promote sleepiness. Take a moment to notice the touch or your pillow on your face or the movement of your breath and if your mind wanders off, gently return it back to what you were observing in that moment.  3. Welcome thoughts and emotions – fearful thoughts such as 'If I don’t sleep, I wont be able to cope' or strong sensations such as anxiety or a racing heart, are a common aspect of insomnia. However, it is often our unhelpful attempts to avoid them such as watching TV or drinking alcohol in the middle of the night that actually keep us awake and fuel them further. Learning to change your relationship with them by getting to know them and even welcoming them when they arrive, helps to reduce their power over you and lessen your struggle with sleep.4. Timing and drive – when we can’t sleep we try to catch up by going to bed earlier, lying in or napping for long periods during the day. Whilst this may help you to cope in the short term, it often leads to a weaker sleep wake cycle. Start to go to bed and get up at ‘roughly’ the same time most nights, as this will help to keep your body clock on time and promote the natural drive to sleep. If you fancy a nap, then limit it too less than 20 minutes.5. The Bedroom – if you are awake at night choose to stay in bed and conserve your energy by lying still and being calm and relaxed. Be mindful and welcome your thoughts and emotions. The key is learning how to be in bed with all of your fears, rather than spending all night struggling with them or getting out of bed to avoid them.6. Live your life – the fear of not sleeping drives us to stop living our lives such as avoiding going out at night with friends or sleeping in the spare room. Commit to making small actions everyday that take you closer to what is important to you in your life, whilst experiencing your insomnia. Doing so takes away the justification for struggling with sleep in the first place and paradoxically promotes sleep.  7. Lifestyle and environment – Live a healthy lifestyle that promotes sleep. For example, drink a moderate amount of caffeine and stop by 2pm. Limit alcohol consumption, especially close to bedtime. Exercise regularly during the day or early evening and for the reasons of enjoyment and health promotion, rather than to get you to sleep. Sleep in a cool, quiet and dark room. Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II claims to clean out dirt or dead skin cells from deep in your skin while you sleep . Estée Lauder have used this research into the importance of sleep in skin cell repair to develop an industry first anti-ageing product. Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery . Complex II works to aid the process of Catabolysis at night, resulting in younger looking skin with long-term use.

Alvin the cat: The four-month old Bengal kitten is coming between Nick and his girlfriend Stephanie . There was no room for negotiation. 'I'm getting  a cat,' my girlfriend Stephanie announced one evening in August. 'But I'm allergic to them,' I replied, incredulous. 'They give me asthma, they bring me out in hives , they make my eyes blister.' 'I'm getting a cat,' she repeated. 'Cat owners smell, and women who own them end up sad and lonely,' I argued. 'Besides, we live on a main road. It won't last a month.' The conversation took place a few weeks after we had moved into our new Surrey home. Alvin arrived two weeks later. They say in life you are either a cat or a dog person. I'm a neither person. I have children. That's all the responsibility I need. I went with Stephanie to collect Alvin from a breeder, figuring it would be better to be involved than not to be. I was even trying to negotiate on the journey, suggesting we get a hairless Sphinx variety (they look weird, but they don't make you sneeze). All to no avail. We were ushered in to choose one of the eight-week-old kittens. In a rash decision that haunts me to this day, I pointed out the liveliest-looking one. 'If you have to get one, get that one; the others look like they've been drugged,' I advised. So, £125 later, Alvin was packed into his crate to accompany us back around the M25, mewing all the way. 'You've wrenched him from his mother and siblings. He's got separation anxiety. Let's take him back,' I tried between sneezes. Alvin's forlorn cries soon subsided when we arrived home and he saw the preposterous array of bedding, toys, scratch posts and cat paraphernalia that had been bought for him. He even had a cat Superman outfit in case he fancied a game of dressing-up. 'Welcome to your new home,' purred Stephanie, who fussed over him for an hour before deciding that 'exposure therapy' was the best way for me to overcome the runny eyes and itchy skin that Alvin was sparking in me. She placed him on my lap on the sofa. 'Have a cuddle with Daddy,' she cooed. For five minutes we sat awkwardly eyeing each other until Alvin urinated on me, jumped down and trotted away. That was our introduction three months ago, and since then my relationship with both Alvin and my partner has degenerated. Teething problems: Alvin wants Stephanie's love - all of it - and Nick is in his way . The cat is coming between us. While Stephanie is increasingly besotted with the new addition to our family, Alvin and I have been having acute teething problems. It's partly my fault. I didn't read the small print about Bengal cats until a few weeks after he'd settled in and started his erratic behaviour. Bengals are a cross between domestic cats with Asian leopard cats, hence their attractive markings. Their temperament is often described as being similar to that of Tigger in Winnie The Pooh: energetic, acrobatic and overly exuberant. Ostensibly, we'd homed the feline equivalent of a toddler with adhd who'd been fed all the blue Smarties. According to the International Bengal Cat Society, these animals 'demand a good deal of attention and affection'. 'Whether they are fishing in the aquarium or playing in their water-bowls, fetching balls for their families, taking walks on a leash or climbing to the top of the highest cupboards, Bengals are constantly on the move and are perfect for anyone who wants to interact and play with their cat daily,' they say. What concerned me more than the allergy-inducing idea of interacting and playing with my cat daily were the online discussions about Bengals, which mentioned jealousy. Alvin's big green eyes were literal and metaphorical: he wanted Stephanie's love, all of it, and I was in his way. 'They say in life you are either a cat or a . dog person. I'm a neither person. I have children. That's all the . responsibility I need.' The skirmishes began with bedtimes. 'He's not coming in the bedroom,' I insisted. 'But he's only small. It's not fair to leave him on his own,'  argued Stephanie. Initially, I stood my ground and shut him out. After an hour or so mewling and clawing at the door, he'd give up and wait reproachfully outside until the morning. If he was lucky, someone would need a toilet break in the night. Then, under cover of darkness, he'd throw himself in the room like a four-legged ninja. One night, I woke up screaming after he crawled silently under the covers and clawed at my buttocks. He'd position himself in the middle of the bed, and if I dared move a limb or digit towards Stephanie, he would attack it before curling up next to her and purring. When I threw him out, I was accused of bullying. The problems got worse as he grew in strength. At just three months old, he was easily able to shove open the bedroom door. At first, I barricaded it shut with the laundry basket. Then I had to bolster the defences with a suitcase. When he managed to get through that, I bought a rubber door stop, which I now wedge under the door. Our cosy evenings on the sofa by the fireside have also become a thing of the past. Alvin seems to come alive at night, usually around 8pm when we are settling down for the evening. He careers round the house and leaps at me with claws unsheathed and teeth bared. Alvin sees me as a human scratching post and, on many occasions, has clambered up my legs and back when I've been on the phone, digging his talons in along the way and forcing me to apologise to the person on the other end of the line for my subsequent expletive-peppered tirade. Ambushed! Alvin launches another flying attack on Nick. The results aren't pretty . My limbs now resemble those of a self-harmer, so much so that people in the gym look at me with a mixture of shock and pity when I wear shorts and a T-shirt. One night a few weeks ago I thought Alvin had left the room, so I sidled up to Stephanie for a cuddle. But he had been waiting behind the curtain. In a flash, he climbed up it and then launched himself at me like a feline Exocet missile. I still have the faint scars on my cheek and forehead from the onslaught. I received no sympathy - far from it. Stephanie thought it was cute that he was so protective. Grudgingly, I admit his climbing prowess is impressive. I have witnessed him scale an exposed brick chimney breast almost to the ceiling in order to launch at me when I put an arm around my beloved. He has learned to open drawers, but the only ones he ransacks are mine - Stephanie's remain untouched. A week ago, he opened the key drawer, found my car key and chewed the buttons off the control bit of it. A romantic Sunday afternoon stroll with Stephanie used to be the highlight of my weekend, but - taking a tip from the Bengal cat website - Stephanie recently bought Alvin a harness and lead. Now he comes with us, trotting between our legs. 'It's good for him to get out and it'll help you two to bond,'  she explained. To make matters worse, Alvin is too small to be let out on his own. Until he turns six months, he is housebound - and I work from home. I've discovered to my cost that he likes keyboards. Specifically, my keyboard. On countless occasions, I have been sitting at my computer working when Alvin will run across the keys. I have lost several pieces of work as he always manages to find the delete button. I do try. I feed him and stroke him, but usually he attacks my hand. Skirmishing: Bengals are jealous creatures and Alvin has not taken kindly to Nick . Sometimes, especially when he is asleep, I catch myself thinking what a wonder of evolution and a handsome devil he is. I also allow myself a smug smile, because I know something he doesn't: at six months old he'll not only be allowed out on his own, he'll also need to be castrated - and I'll be the one who takes him to the vet. So when Alvin comes round from the anaesthetic and realises something is terribly amiss in his nether regions, I'll be there, smiling, to remind him that I am the Daddy after all, not him.","Alvin is a fourth-month old kitten besotted with Nick's girlfriend Stephanie .

IVF testing: Patients will pay around £3,000 for donor eggs, on top of the £5,000 fee for IVF . Britain's first human egg bank launches today to help growing numbers of women who delay motherhood. Donors will be paid up to £750 for their eggs which will be given to patients who are unable to produce healthy ones of their own. The clinic behind the scheme says it is a practical way of plugging the shortage of donors and helping patients achieve their dream of having a family. It is also hoped that access to a British egg bank will deter IVF patients from seeking treatment in countries with poor safety records. Patients will pay around £3,000 for donor eggs, on top of the £5,000 fee for IVF. But critics fear the  vulnerable will be exploited, with cash-strapped young women  signing up as donors without fully understanding the risks. The drugs used to boost egg production before donation can cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome – a potentially fatal condition in which the ovaries are unable to cope with the extra eggs released. Women who donate their eggs while young could also face the problem of being unable to conceive in later years – knowing that they have biological children being raised by someone else. Demand for donor eggs is outstripping supply, partly because more women are delaying motherhood to a time when the odds of becoming pregnant with their own eggs are low. With some waiting lists years  long, the country’s fertility watchdog recently trebled the maximum amount of compensation for ‘effort, time and pain’ paid to donors to £750. The London Egg Bank, which is a partnership between the Bridge Centre and the London Women’s Clinic, says the payment will cover donors’ travel expenses, time off work and the cost of any childcare. Human egg tanks at the Assisted reproduction and gynaecology centre. Britain's first human egg bank will be launched this week . It points out that women need to visit the clinic up to eight times before their eggs are removed. Dr Kamal Ahuja, director of the London Women’s Clinic, expects most donors to be professionals who are already parents and want others to experience the joy of motherhood. He said many egg donors have ‘seen infertility at close hand among their friends and family’ or ‘want to give something back’. ‘Many donors have children of their own and are in settled family relationships. They are keen to donate their eggs but have never been encouraged to do so.’ But Josephine Quintavalle, of campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: ‘With money so scarce at the moment one can imagine vulnerable young women considering this a useful way to make ends meet.’ Donors will receive counselling. They will also be told that any children born from their eggs will have the right to trace them at 18. Anna Smajdor, a medical ethicist at the University of East Anglia, said: ‘The new egg bank may reduce the incentives to buy eggs from abroad – and the danger of exploitation that this involves. ‘But it represents another step towards the separation of reproductive processes into commodifiable components, a process that in itself raises fundamental ethical questions.’ Karen Richmond, 53, with her daughter Georgia .","Patients will pay around £3,000 for donor eggs, on top of the £5,000 fee for IVF .

Staff shortages mean maternity units are being left in the hands of junior doctors who have to rely on calling consultants at home. The National Audit Office research shows that one in 65 babies delivered in English hospitals during the week suffer some form of harm. But at weekends, the ratio rises to one in 60 – a 13 per cent higher risk. Risk: The National Audit Office research shows that one in 65 babies delivered in English hospitals during the week suffer some form of harm. But at weekends, the ratio rises to one in 60 . Complications include brain damage, spinal injury, broken bones and scarring to the head and face. These happen when doctors and midwives fail to act quickly enough, either during labour difficulties or during an intervention such as a caesarean section. The risk of infection to mother and baby was also shown to be significantly higher in weekend births. Research has consistently found that patients are up to 10 per cent more likely to die if admitted to hospital at weekends – rising to 80 per cent if they undergo surgery. This month the NHS’s medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, will publish a report calling for hospitals to offer better weekend care. The audit office report says the NHS spends half a billion pounds a year paying compensation and legal fees to victims of blunders during childbirth – a fifth of the maternity care budget. Staffing: Separate figures from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists published in September found that a third of maternity units have no consultants at the weekends . Joyce Robins, of the group Patient Concern, said: ‘Babies aren’t just born Mondays to Fridays. ‘It is very frightening that babies . may be suffering complications that will be with them for the rest of . their lives just because the right person wasn’t around at the weekend. ‘It’s . extraordinary that doctors’ schedules allow them to only work Monday to . Friday when babies are born and people become ill round the clock on . all days of the week.’ The . report warned most maternity units are left solely in the hands of . ‘doctors in training’ – junior medics – at weekends with a consultant . available on the phone. These senior doctors can live up to 30 minutes away by car and may not arrive quickly enough in an emergency. Separate figures from the Royal College . of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists published in September found that a . third of maternity units have no consultants at the weekends. Just half . employed their most senior member of staff to work during the evening – . usually up to 8pm – and three quarters did not have any working . overnight. Worry: Complications including brain damage and scarring to the head and face can happen when doctors and midwives fail to act quickly enough . Margaret Hodge, the Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘The current system is not working as it should. I find it absolutely scandalous that one fifth of all funding for maternity services is spent on clinical negligence cover.’ The audit office said a lack of consultant cover was not the sole reason for the greater risk at weekends because fewer midwives and other specialists work these hours. It also found that babies born in hospitals in England are far more likely to die than elsewhere in the UK and Europe. The mortality rate is 7.5 per 1,000 births in England compared with 6.9 in Scotland, 6.6 in Wales, 6.4 in Northern Ireland and 5.5 in Germany. A total of 1,146 compensation claims were made last year – a rise of 80 per cent in five years.","National Audit Office found one in 65 babies suffer some harm in the week .

It’s called Transformational Breathing, the latest health craze to hit Hollywood – and it’s something I had no doubt was total nonsense. Goldie Hawn uses it ‘to manage stress’, and has now introduced it to her daughter Kate Hudson. Naomie Harris, star of Skyfall and Mandela, the forthcoming biopic about Nelson Mandela, also swears by it. Would that kind of endorsement alone persuade me to attend a  class in a breathing technique  that claims to be able to help depression, chronic pain, migraine, insomnia, anxiety and even asthma? Probably not. But two things have convinced me to attend a session hosted by Alan Dolan, aka ‘the breath guru’, in North London. Easy breathing: Both Kate Hudson and Naomie Harris use Transformational Breathing to help them stay calm and manage stress in their whirlwind Hollywood lives . First, studies show that meditation, which uses breath control, is not only effective in treating anxiety, it physically alters the structure of the brain to make you more emotionally stable. Second, I have a long, illustrious history of anxiety. My 20s were blighted by unbearable panic attacks and an anxiety disorder that triggered a four-year addiction to sleeping pills. An array of treatments, including cognitive behavioural therapy, brought it largely under control. It’s years since I had a panic attack, but every now and then anxiety can grip me, manifesting in hypochondria, insomnia or stress that leaves me unable to concentrate or even vaguely enjoy myself. I’ve tried meditation before but I always give up as I don’t ever feel it’s doing anything. Now I’ve decided to place my faith in Alan, a slight 50-year-old with a goatee and a soothing voice. He describes the mechanics of the technique. ‘First of all, the inhalation and exhalation are of different lengths – about three to one. Hands-on approach: Alan Dolan - the so called 'breath guru' - teaches Transformational Breathing in one of his London classes . ‘If you breathe in slowly for three counts or three seconds you exhale quickly for one – imagine you are trying to steam up some glass. ‘The longer inhale allows you to access more oxygen and energy. The exhale allows you to access any emotional energy that’s been held  in the system. It’s like clearing out  the trash.’ The next rule is to breathe with your mouth open – fairly wide, so you could at least fit a finger between your teeth. Alan says this helps increase the volume of air breathed in and out. ‘The other vital aspect is that you don’t hold the breath at the peak of inhalation or exhalation but keep it moving. That’s what puts you into an altered state of consciousness.’ Anyone prone to anxiety is generally welcoming of any state other than an anxious one, so I keep listening. Alan instructs me to sit down with my back against some cushions, to close my eyes, open my mouth and place my hand on the bottom of my abdomen so I can feel it rise up each time I breathe in. This ensures the diaphragm is used more than the upper part of the lungs, which are deployed during exercise or panicky breathing.  Initially I can’t do it. There is so much to think about – keeping your hand on your belly, your mouth wide open, sticking to the unnatural rhythm of the longer inhale while also keeping the breath moving. My mouth becomes dry and my mind and body try to revolt against this strange process. But Alan encourages me to keep going and gradually I find the rhythm. The further into the session we go, the more strange things start to happen. First I crave indulgent food such as chocolate fondant. Then my body temperature seems to rise. I start sweating. Tingling is next, flooding up from my fingers through my arms, and through my feet into my shins. After what seems like about 15 minutes Alan tells me to bring my breathing back to a slow, regular rhythm and gently open my eyes. That’s when the most dramatic effect becomes apparent. Everything is slow – my mind, my reactions, my movements. The sense of calm is profound. It is, for want of a less hippy word, blissful. ‘How long was I doing that for?’ I ask. ‘An hour,’ replies Alan. For the rest of the evening I luxuriate in delicious, euphoric calm. The next day I’m back to normal but with one chief difference: I know that by changing my breathing I can feel dramatically different. In the days that follow, when I feel stressed or unable to sleep, I take Alan’s advice and practise it on my own for ten minutes. It works, although not to the same level of calm as the first time, presumably because I’m only doing it for a fraction of the time. Much of this is similar to the effects noticed by devotees of meditation, and yet the technique is different. So what could be happening physiologically? Dr Oliver Firth, who specialises in treating divers with decompression sickness, explains: ‘It’s a rising carbon dioxide level that triggers a breath. By deliberately slowing down your breathing, carbon dioxide levels build up in the body, and carbon dioxide does have quite a soporific effect on people, causing them to feel relaxed.’ This is, however, still debated. But I’m in no doubt: where meditation failed, transformational breathing succeeded. It’s the pill I wish I’d had all along.

The march of TV technology is being blamed for stopping motorists in their tracks… literally. A popular device that allows viewers to transmit signals to televisions around their home can render remote car key fobs useless. As a result car owners are left stranded on their driveways because they can’t get into their vehicles or, in some cases, start them up. The problem can come from just one so-called ‘video sender’ but it has the potential to upset a whole street of motorists. The revelation came from broadcast regulator Ofcom which was called in to investigate the issue in a road in Southampton. Inspectors found a resident’s wireless sender attached to their satellite TV box was to blame. When it was switched off the neighbours’ fobs started working again. Ofcom said ‘leakage’ from the sender emitted the same frequency as the fobs and blocked their signal. Video senders can be bought from around £80. They take the signal from a cable or satellite TV set-top box and transmit it wirelessly to other TVs in the house. But there can be momentary interference when viewers press to change channel. Sometimes the senders jam, continuing to transmit interference. The continued signal can hit cars in a whole street, says Ofcom. Spokesman Rhys Hurd said: ‘Over the past 12 months we have responded to 140 of these cases and a lot of them relate to senders. ‘Our teams have to knock on doors to see how many people are affected. It can be a whole  street. Sometimes people say the problem happens in the morning, and then again from tea-time – in line with someone’s work patterns. That’s a big clue.’ The Southampton street case caused chaos for residents. One, Madeleine Wentworth, said: ‘Everyone was baffled. We knew there was something wrong.’ The problem is most acute for those with the most sophisticated car that have ‘keyless entry’ where the fob is needed to start the car. Sky said it did not endorse the use of senders with its products. It said its boxes did not interfere with any other wireless devices.","In the last year Ofcom has responded to 140 cases of drivers being unable to use their key fobs .

A 2ft snake that had been missing for two months escaped into a neighbour's home and wrapped itself around her dinner tray as she sat down to eat. Carol Ormes said she screamed in terror when she finally spotted the corn snake, named Bam Bam, coiled around the tray. The 11-month-old snake had been missing from neighbour Karina Peek's vivarium since it escaped two months ago. Corn snake Bam Bam was missing for two months before it was found coiled around Carol Ormes' dinner tray . Carol Ormes (right) said she screamed in terror when she saw the snake but Karina Peek (left) was 'ecstatic' about finding her son Jason's missing pet . A second snake is also on the loose and Mrs Ormes, 54, said she now fears it will also show up in her house. She said Bam Bam blended in so well with the wooden handle of her tray that she went to put her plate down on it. Mrs Ormes, from Laindon in Essex, said: 'I noticed this face looking at me and I just screamed. 'My husband thought I was overreacting as he thought it was a spider. I just launched the tray at him and ran into the kitchen.' Ms Peek, 31, had given up all hope of finding Bam Bam, one of eight snakes that she looks after with her two children, Chloe, 13, and Jason, nine. She was overjoyed to find out he had been found on Friday, June 14. She said: 'I couldn't believe it, I was ecstatic as I didn't think I would see him again. 'As I have gone in I saw Carol in the kitchen and didn't think anything of it but looking back she did look really startled.' Mrs Ormes is terrified her neighbour's other missing snake, Elektra (pictured), will also show up in her house . Mrs Ormes said: 'I can laugh about it . now. I didn't realise how big he was, if I had seen the whole length of . it I would be in hospital with a heart attack.' She said she was in hysterics and has no idea how the snake got into her semi-detached home. Ms Peek said corn snakes are known for being 'escape artists' but her son had not shut the vivarium properly which left a small gap for him to slither out of. Although the family are thrilled to have Bam Bam home, they are still hoping daughter Chloe's bright pink corn snake, Elektra, may turn up - she escaped a month before Bam Bam. Ms Peek added: 'The house literally got demolished to try and find these snakes. 'Jason is pleased because at least it's not his fault any more, but Chloe's gutted it wasn't Elektra that was found.' Mrs Ormes now fears the other snake may turn up elsewhere in her home. She added: 'I feel a bit apprehensive now, I think the other is in here too.' Corn snakes, which are native to North America, can grow up to 6ft long and prey on rodents, killing them by constriction. Their reluctance to bite makes them popular pets, and in captivity they can live to be up to 23 years old.","Carol Ormes said she screamed in terror when she spotted the corn snake .

As if health concerns weren't reason enough to perhaps avoid fast food, an ex-Burger King employee has provided another. In the latest instance of a fast food worker posting obscene behavior on-the-job to social media, a young Burger King employee in Japan recently posted a picture of himself laying down on a pile of hamburger buns to Twitter. The fast food chain apologized and the employee was fired for his actions, according to a statement posted online. Baka King: This former Burger King Japan employee outraged people in the country with his on-the-job antics . Uploaded by Twitter user @inotayuta, who until recently slung Whoppers for the burger giant in Japan, the picture shows the young Japanese sloucher relaxing with a huge grin on his face and the caption ‘How many Whopper Juniors do you think I've made? See if you can figure out it for yourself.’ As upsetting as the image of an employee lounging on buns is, several people were also upset by the filthy bucket next to the buns, in a posting of the picture to the Japanese website 2ch. The same Twitter user also posted a picture of himself sitting in a trash can while on the job. Kotaku rightly pointed out that the outrage among Japanese stems from a culture where food and excellent customer service are considered very important. For an employee to deface the food in such a manner is reprehensible, if not unforgivable. Hard at work: The now-deleted Twitter account was a showcase for this employees less-than-stellar work ethic . Users on 2ch, the country’s largest online forum, emailed the company en masse, demanding action be taken. In a statement, Burger King Japan assured customers that the buns were trash and not served for consumption. It also said the employee was receiving a strict reprimand for the photos, which BuzzFeed reported was his termination. The offensive employee’s Twitter account has been deleted, but many on the site have taken to calling him ‘Baka King,’ baka means ‘stupid,' but is also a play on the Japanese spelling of Burger as 'ba-ga-.' The burger chain also said staff would be retrained on proper customer service and sanitation – hopefully that includes not sitting in the trash and adequate cleaning of buckets. At least he didn't lick the buns. Not served to customers: Burger King said the buns were disposed of and not served to customers, just as Taco Bell asserted the taco shells licked by this employee were not served either .","This is not the first photo the ex-employee posted to social media of on-the-job goofing off .

Mischief managed: Parents of children displaying antisocial-behaviour are to be taught how to calm them down . Parents of children displaying anti-social behaviour are to be told to take lessons in how to manage them. They will be taught how to avoid ‘inflaming the situation’ when their child flies off the handle under guidance drawn  up to deal with thousands of children diagnosed with conduct disorders. The problem is estimated to affect one child in 20 aged five to 16, with each costing £70,000 to educational and other services. The main recommendation, from the healthcare body Nice, is for group training programmes to be offered to the parents of children as young as three who have a conduct disorder or are at risk of developing one. They will act out situations involving ‘challenging’ behaviour and be taught how to stop saying ‘no’ to children. Experts say that saying merely ‘no’ triggers further misbehaviour. Instead parents will learn to ignore bad actions and reward the child for good behaviour. The guidance comes from the healthcare body NICE (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence). Professor Peter Fonagy, a member of the guideline group and Professor of Psychoanalysis at University College London (UCL), said the advice did not mean parents were being misled by ‘Supernanny’ and other gurus who advocate discipline and strict boundaries for children. He said ‘All children can be naughty, defiant and impulsive from time to time, which is perfectly normal. ‘However, some children have extremely difficult and challenging behaviours that are outside the norm for their age.’ He said children diagnosed with a conduct disorder need to be managed in a counter-intuitive way. ‘Parents are taught how to say yes. ‘They learn how to ignore negative behaviour and focus on the positive because the attention that normally follows from being told not to do something leads to more negative behaviour. ‘It’s logical to say don’t do that’ he said. ‘These are not bad parents but a punitive approach makes things worse’ he added. He said these children differ from occasionally naughty children by being persistently defiant in a range of situations. ASBO issues: Every single child with conductive disorder costs £70,000 to educational and other services with one in 20 aged between five and 20 affected by the problem . Professor Stephen Pilling, director of the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, UCL and facilitator of the guideline group, said: 'Conduct disorder has real consequences for the child and their families, schooling is disrupted, family life can become very stressful and problems with drug and alcohol misuse and the criminal justice system are common. ‘But the problems associated with conduct disorder are often lifelong; with adults who had a conduct disorder during their childhood being far more likely to develop another mental health disorder when they are an adult - nearly half go on to develop antisocial personality disorder. ‘The costs to individuals, families and society of untreated conduct disorder are enormous.’ He said many parents would welcome help, which should be coordinated by GPs, teachers and social workers. ‘Parent training programmes provide them with strategies for dealing with difficult children and how to better handle them going forward’ he added. Figures suggest adults who had a conduct disorder or conduct problems in childhood are responsible for 80 per cent of crime. It is estimated that the costs of services to individuals diagnosed with conduct disorder at the age of 10 over a period of about 18 years is estimated at £70,000. The estimated costs of group or individual parent training is £1,600-£3,000, while intensive family training may cost £15,000, say Nice.","Parents to be taught how to deal with children with conduct disorders .

A failed marriage proposal that left a would-be groom mortified in front of the entire crowd at a minor league Connecticut baseball game last week was all an elaborate hoax, the team revealed this morning. The New Britain Rock Cats uploaded video of the apparent on-field rejection on YouTube after the game on August 2. Since then it has taken the internet by storm, garnering some 600,000 views and prompting the question: is it a fake? And, after failing to respond to MailOnline's calls yesterday, the Rock Cats today admitted the proposal was a phoney - and the seemingly ill-fated couple, David and Jessica, were just two employees acting out a skit. Down on one knee: Spectators were shocked when 'Jessica' apparently rejected her boyfriend David's public proposal . Rock Cats vice President of marketing Mike Abramson said the team's promotions team dreamed up by the prank to entertain fans and attract wider attention to the small-scale team. 'After watching a public proposal, we talked about what would happen if the answer were NO, and how that might affect a crowd, and those viewing it after on video,' Abramson said. 'We worked with two of our employees on the skit and executed a digital strategy to set the video on a viral path; we could not be more pleased with the outcome.' He added: 'If anyone was offended by the promotion in any way we sincerely apologize; this endeavor was intended to entertain and remind fans you never know what you're going to see at a Rock Cats game.' It's usually the players - not the spectators - who strike-out at baseball games, which is why spectators were so shocked when hopeless romantic 'David ' asking his girlfriend 'Jessica' to marry him at the minor league game and she responded 'No.' Scroll down for video . All a ploy: The employee who acted out David looked anxious but excited as he prepared to ask his girlfriend Jessica if she will marry him . Romantic: The crowd saw David drop to one knee to propose . In the promotion, the fake couple were on the field answering questions when the announcer passed the microphone to David. 'Will you marry me Jessica?' he asked. Stepping back with her hands over her mouth, Jessica stammered: 'David, I'm sorry, I can't.' She then sprinted out of the stadium as the announcer laughed. 'Sorry, I don't mean to laugh David, I don't think we've ever had this happen before,' he said in the skit. The rejected suitor turned as red as his T-shirt as he ran out away, with the mascot still dancing around the field. The Big Lead speculated the proposal was a hoax, but the Huffington Post reckoned . the 'woman's off-microphone reaction seems pretty real'. And online, opinions were mixed. Witness, John Poutre, commented on YouTube that he believed the proposal was legitimate. 'I was there, my first thought was that it was fake. But what would the point of that be?' he wrote. 'The . guy worked for the team in some way, he ran in the dugout (saw him . later) and she ran out of the stadium. All I can say is KNOW THE ANSWER . BEFORE ASKING!!!' Shocked: Jessica, stepping backward, looks distressed as she rejects David's offer. Some believe her acting skills were lacklustre . Humiliating: David runs off the baseball field after Jessica tells him she doesn't want to marry him in the prank . Other Rock Cats fans, shocked at what they witnessed, took to Twitter to sympathize with David. Donald . Salvesen tweeted on August 2: 'At the #rockcats game and we witnessed a rejected, . on field marriage proposal. The crowd gasped, the players were laughing . as the girl ran off humiliated.

A type of antibiotic passed between chickens and humans are to blame for 280 human deaths in Britain per year, according to a new study. Billions of chickens are given antibiotics to treat E.coli bacteria but this has resulted in several strains of superbugs developing which are, when passed to humans, resistant to treatment. Scientists have documented their findings in the Journal for Infectious Diseases and described the number of deaths as 'staggering'. They believe that as many as 1,500 people die a year across Europe. Infection rates of one particular strain known as G3CREC tripled between people and animals between 2007 and 2012. The scientists used data from the Netherlands and concluded that there were 1,318 additional deaths across Europe. 'The number of avoidable deaths and the costs of healthcare potentially caused by third-generation cephalosporin use in food animals is staggering. 'Considering these factors, the ongoing use of these antimicrobial drugs... should be urgently examined and stopped, particularly in poultry, not only in Europe but worldwide.' Infection rates of one particular strain of E.coli known as G3CREC tripled between people and animals between 2007 and 2012 . Richard Young, policy advisor at the Soil Association, said: 'This is the first detailed estimate to emerge of the human health consequences from the use of antibiotics in European agriculture.

Lockdown: Christian Gerhartsreiter, pictured today, as he is sentenced to life in prison at an LA court . A man who posed as a Rockefeller heir has been sentenced to 27 years to life in prison for a 1980s murder in California. Christian Gerhartsreiter was sentenced on Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court for the killing of John Sohus, who disappeared along with his wife Linda in 1985. John Sohus’ bones were later dug up in the backyard of a suburban San Marino home where Gerhartsreiter had been a tenant living under a false name. The German immigrant also vanished . around that time and in the following years masqueraded across the U.S. under a series of identities. One of his most fantastical was when he styled himself as Clark Rockefeller, a pretender to the dynasty's . oil fortune. He also had stints as a movie producer and a wizard of Wall Street. Publicity over . his conviction in the Massachusetts kidnapping of his own daughter led . investigators to re-examine the California cold case. At his sentencing on Thursday, Gerhartsreiter represented himself after firing his lawyers. He again asserted that he did not commit the murder of John Sohus and asked to read a voluminous motion he had submitted to the court. When Superior Court Judge George Lomeli refused, he withdrew the motion. The hearing was marked by an emotional statement from Sohus' sister, who said some questions in the case will never be answered. She said that until his dying day, her father always asked: 'Why John?' She told the judge: 'You cannot give me back my brother. All I as is that you hold Mr. Gerhartsreiter accountable.' Scroll down for video . End of the road: Gerhartsreiter grimaces in court where a judge denied him the right to read a huge motion he had prepared . Who do you think you are? The FBI pulled fingerprints off decades-old immigration papers to identify the suspect who calls himself Clark Rockefeller - but was really a German man who came to the U.S. as a youth and later adopted several aliases . Gerhartsreiger, handcuffed and wearing a blue jail uniform, was calm and respectful as he addressed the judge, saying he wished to read his motion aloud for the benefit of reporters and others. 'There is great public interest,' he said. 'It would save time for the media.' The judge told him his motion would become part of the public file where anyone can read it. But it did not become part of the public record because at that point Gerhartsreiter said: 'If I do not get to read the motion, I will withdraw it.' The judge said it was his right. Asked if he had any last words for the court, Gerhartsreiter said: 'I can only say again I want to assert my innocence. I did not commit the crime for which I was convicted.' Gerhartsreiter, 52, insisted from the outset he was innocent. The German immigrant who fooled friends, lovers and a wife during an extraordinary three-decade charade took over his own representation after a jury convicted him of first-degree murder in the death of Sohus, whose bones were found buried at a suburban San Marino home. Fighting alone: Gerhartsreiter carries his legal documents into court on August 15 after he fired his lawyers and decided he would represent himself . It was a heavily circumstantial case built 28 years after Sohus vanished. There was no slam-dunk DNA solution to a murder mystery. But discovery of the bones buried for two decades in a backyard where the defendant had lived added a crucial piece to the puzzle of the man who later called himself Clark Rockefeller. Sohus, a 27-year-old computer programmer who was the son of the defendant's landlady, vanished with his wife, Linda, in 1985. No trace of her has been found. Gerhartsreiter hinted at a recent hearing that he might have information about her whereabouts. At Gerhartsreiter's trial, witnesses now old and frail testified about the stranger who came into their elegant town, befriending church members who invited him into their homes. Their testimony exhumed the ghosts of the happy young newlyweds, who inexplicably vanished shortly before the man then known as Chris Chichester also disappeared. It turned out he was off on a decades-long odyssey across the country. Variously known as Chris Crowe, Chip Smith and Clark Rockefeller, he wormed his way into high society and important jobs, married a wealthy woman and controlled her funds. Sentenced: Christian Gerhartsreiter from Germany speaks to guards as he attends his murder trial at Los Angeles Superior Court . But his identity unraveled when he kidnapped their daughter during a custody dispute. The resulting publicity led California authorities to revisit the Sohus disappearance and the bones found in San Marino in 1994. He was near the end of his sentence in Boston for kidnapping his young daughter, when he was charged with murder. The California case was circumstantial, built from memories and bits and pieces of evidence, primarily the bones found with a bag bearing the logo of a university once attended by the defendant. With the passage of time and lack of a motive, the prosecutor had a difficult challenge. 'Sometimes you're afraid that this guy's conned so many people for so many years that this will be the one last time he pulls off his last con,' the prosecutor after the verdict. 'But that didn't happen.' The defense attorney at the time, Jeffrey Denner, said that Gerhartsreiter probably was his own worst enemy. 'The way he went through life deceiving people did not make him very likable to the jury,' Denner said. 'But that doesn't make him a killer.' Jurors took a scant six hours to convict him. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty.

The NSPCC is still receiving calls from victims of Jimmy Savile a year on from the TV documentary which exposed the serial paedophile’s reign of terror. Police say there the former BBC broadcaster abused at least 1,300 people over 54 years - but the children’s charity said more were still coming forward. The charity revealed that publicity over the scandal has led to an overall surge in the number of child victims of sexual abuse and rape contacting the NSPCC. Shocking figures: Police believe Jimmy Savile abused at least 1,300 people over 54 years while children's charity NSPCC says more victims are still coming forward . Over the past year, the number of referrals from the charity’s helpline to police and social services has almost doubled - up 84 per cent - in response to publicity surrounding the scandal. In June and July this year, almost 600 calls were referred - up from 323 over the same two months the year before. The chief executive of the NSPCC hailed the increase, saying it showed that the Savile scandal was encouraging victims to come forward after years of silence. But Peter Wanless warned that, unless the country does more to step in sooner, we could find that another Savile has long been in our midst going unpunished. He said the Savile scandal had served to push the problem of child abuse up the news agenda. ‘Police now believe there could be up to 1,300 victims, some as young as five. Incredibly, calls from people saying they were abused by Savile are still being taken by the NSPCC to this day,’ he said. ‘And as the media has followed the narrative and focused on some of the darkness beneath this upturned stone, we have seen more and more stories of child abuse punctuating the headlines. The NSPCC believes the publicity surrounding the Jimmy Savile scandal has pushed child abuse up the news agenda and has helped encourage victims to come forward after years of silence . ‘From grooming gang scandals and unfolding revelations surrounding other celebrities, to care home abuse in Wales, the spotlight has continued to highlight increasingly scandalous evidence of child mistreatment which 21st century Britain hoped it had left behind long ago.’ Mr Wanless said fewer people now believed that lots of sex accusations are false, or that young girls were ‘asking for it’ or were predatory groupies. ‘It’s good that people now seem far more willing to take action, to pick up the phone in an effort to secure justice,’ he said. ‘We’ve seen a huge surge in calls to the NSPCC about a whole range of abuse which continues to this day, a full year later. ‘There has been an 84 per cent increase in referrals about sexual abuse from our helpline to police and social services. Each referral is a child protected so thousands of additional children have been safeguarded by calls to the NSPCC alone. Chief Executive of the NSPCC, Peter Wanless, pictured, warned more must be done to stop another Savile developing into a sex offender . ‘There has been a 77 per cent increase in reporting of child rape and serious sexual assault in London and a 23 per cent increase in reporting of adult rape. ‘This isn’t because more people are being abused, raped or assaulted, it’s because more of the majority who don’t speak out now feel more confident about doing so.’ Mr Wanless praised the police and the court service for making it easier for potential victims to come forward and cope with the ordeal of a trial. ‘I sense a change in attitudes,’ he said. ‘People will no longer say that something just happened and there isn’t much you can do. ‘People are prepared to challenge injustice no matter how powerful the perpetrator is. If we can see major celebrities like Stuart Hall go to jail, then no sex offender should feel safe. ‘But we are not there yet. Sadly we still live in a society where some well-educated, influential people think that a drunk girl who is raped is “partly to blame” for what happened to her.’ The NSPCC boss said society had to do more to stop abuse before it starts - rather than just reacting when harm is done. ‘We have to stop another Savile developing into a sex offender in the first place and, if he does, stop him after his first attack not his 500th,’ he said. ‘To do this, we have to make child abuse everybody’s business. And we must maintain the pressure on our politicians even when the headlines are a distant memory. ‘The time is right for change; in fact it may be a once in a generation opportunity. If we don’t grasp it with both hands we may find, in years to come, another Savile has been living amongst us.’","Police say Jimmy Savile abused at least 1,300 people over 54 years .

Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford may deny being a crack head, but he has no problem outing himself as a pot head. Taking questions from reporters after a campaign address Wednesday, Ford was asked if he had used marijuana. ‘Oh yeah,’ he said nonchalantly with a chuckle. ‘I won't deny that. I smoked a lot of it.’ Scroll down for video . Nonchalant: A grinning Toronto Mayor Rob Ford casually admitted to smoking 'a lot' of marijuna while talking to reporters after a campaign event Wednesday . Substance abuse: Ford has spent the last four months denying allegations that he is addicted to crack cocaine . Ford did not answer when asked how recently he had smoked it, a CBC.ca video of the encounter showed. Mr Ford made global headlines in May when U.S. media outlet Gawker and the Toronto Star both claimed that their reporters had seen a cellphone video that appears to show Ford using crack cocaine. The video has not been released publicly and Ford has refused to leave office. He has denied the allegations saying, ‘I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine.’ The offhand marijuana comment by the leader of Canada's largest city came as Ford was leaving a business luncheon at a fitness center. Three years ago, Ford admitted he was charged with driving under the influence and marijuana possession in Florida in the 1990s. At first he denied these allegations, but later pleaded no-contest to the impaired driving charge and the drug charge was dropped. Ford was pressed about his pot past Wednesday after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau admitted that he puffed on a joint three years ago, while a member of Parliament, and had used the drug five or six times in his life. Trudeau has said pot should be regulated and legalized. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne also said Wednesday that she smoked a little pot about 35 years ago, before she got not politics. ‘It's never been a big part of my life,’ said the 60-year-old premier, according to Calgary Herald. Casual users: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau (left) admitted that he puffed on a joint three years ago, and Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne (right) also said she smoked a little pot about 35 years ago . Marijuana use remains illegal in Canada, with the exception of medical marijuana, which is used to manage chronic pain and for conditions that include multiple sclerosis and arthritis. There have been numerous pushes to decriminalize its use, with supporters arguing it should not be grouped in with more addictive and powerful drugs. Critics argue that marijuana can be a ‘gateway drug’ to abuse of other illegal substances. Despite the lingering questions regarding Ford’s alleged addiction to crack cocaine, the mayor has continued to enjoy support from a segment of Toronto voters, particularly in the suburbs, who lifted him to power in 2010 on a platform of controlling spending and cutting taxes. Ford says he plans to run for reelection. Earlier this month, a video surfaced that many observers say showed Mr Ford staggering drunkenly around a Toronto neighborhood declaring, 'I' not driving, I'm not driving,' after attending a street festival. Cast of characters: The new revelation add to the less-than-stellar associations of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. He is seen here with three suspected members of a Toronto street gang . Video surfaced Saturday that appeared to show Mr Ford drunkenly wandering through a neighborhood after going to a street festival . In May, a suspected drug dealer approached two media outlets with a video that claimed to show Ford smoking crack cocaine. Mr Ford denies the existence of such a video. Ford was also pictured with three alleged members of the Dixon City Bloods, a Toronto street gang, in front of the home of two other childhood friends, Fabio and Elana Basso. Mr Ford was elected in 2010. He has been under fire for much of that time for various scandals, including allegation that he was caught on video smoking crack cocaine . On August 10, a video surfaced that appeared to show the mayor stumbling drunkenly through a neighborhood after attending a Greek street festival. 'I'm not driving,' the red-faced mayor could be repeatedly heard saying. Mala Turay, who posted the video, told CBC News that the mayor also asked several times 'where's the party?' 'He's the mayor. He should be setting a better example if he's representing our city like that,' Turay said. When stopped by a CBC reporter as he was buying snacks at a gas station at 1am Saturday, the mayor dismissed the video and allegation that he was intoxicated. 'I'm big news. I'm a big guy. I guess anything happens with me is big, right?' he said.","Ford was leaving business luncheon when a reporter asked him if he'd used pot .

But this year, your favourite festive treats could hit your wallet as hard as your waistline, with the cost of chocolate set to soar by up to a third. Crippling rises in the price of cocoa butter could add 21p to the cost of every 100g of milk chocolate by December, experts said. Totting up: Rising prices of cocoa butter will push up your average 100g sweet bite by 21p this December . It would affect everything from truffles to advent calendars and chocolate coins. The cost of producing chocolate has gone up by 33 per cent in the last year thanks to a 70 per cent rise in the price of cocoa butter, a 50 per cent rise in milk powder prices and a 15 per cent increase in whey powder costs. Cocoa powder and sugar have fallen in price, but they account for a much smaller proportion of production costs, according to the report for trade journal The Grocer. So far, chocolate makers have sheltered consumers from some of the costs. There has been a small 7.5 per cent rise in the price of a Cadbury’s Dairy Milk bar, while a box of Quality Street costs 14.3 per cent more. It could have an impact on all chocolatey treats - from brownies to truffles; advent calendars to coins . But with peak season approaching, there may be price hikes to come ahead of the Christmas rush. Cocoa butter makes up around a quarter of the production cost of milk chocolate, said analysts Mintec. Prices are currently at a four-year high of £4,000 a tonne, a 70 per cent increase on this time last year. Bad weather has hit the key growing region of Ivory Coast, leading to a lower supply and a poor forecast for the 2013/14 crop, while demand is unusually high. Mintec analyst Liliana Gonzalez said:  ‘Rising cocoa butter prices and inflation on other key ingredients have taken their toll on chocolate manufacturers.’ Upmarket maker Thorntons has put prices up by an average 11.5 per cent in the last 12 months, said The Grocer. But in contrast, the price of a box of Celebrations is currently the same as this time last year, while a box of Roses costs only 1.3 per cent more.","Rising cost of cocoa butter will push every 100g of milk chocolate up 21p .

While the current bad girl of pop showed she definitely doesn't feel the cold, she wasn't the only car-crash on the red carpet. Miley's crotch-skimming number was rivalled by Iggy Azalea's sheer black dress that was slashed all the way up to her bellybutton - as both stars proved it must be busy season for bikini waxers. The Bounce rapper, 23, suffered a shocking wardrobe malfunction which saw her bare all to the cameras as she readjusted her outfit. She seemed to forget she was being photographed as she lifted up her dress, seemingly to check everything was in order 'down below', and exposed her miniscule flesh-coloured pants.

The Burn hitmaker wore her long blonde locks hanging in loose waves around her shoulders, while opting for natural, dewy make-up.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:57 EST, 4 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:23 EST, 8 November 2013 . The boss of the firm which owns British Gas has promised not to take a bonus this year amid mounting public anger at bills soaring by more than 9 per cent. Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw said that while families are ‘under pressure’, pay and perks in the energy industry could not continue unabated. But last year his total pay, benefits and bonus package was worth almost £5million and he still stands to receive millions in share awards this year. Pledge: Centrica's Chief Executive Sam Laidlaw told the CBI he will not accept a bonus this year, but will still take home millions . Mr Laidlaw gave no suggestion that he planned to reverse the planned rises this winter, and will still take home a £1million salary. Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises for this winter. British Gas will increase electricity charges by 10.4 per cent and gas 8.4 per cent from November 23, hitting 7.8million homes. Mr Laidlaw, said the energy industry was ‘in the eye of the storm’, conceding that firms should be more transparent, explain how bills are made up and improve the process of switching suppliers. He was speaking at the CBI annual conference in London on the topic, Business Trust Under the Spotlight. Mr Laidlaw said he had decided not to take his bonus, because there was a need for leadership at a time of public anger. 'Bonuses are independently set by our remuneration committee but in this environment there is a case for leadership. ‘Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it,’ he said. Squeeze: British Gas will increase electricity charges by 10.4 per cent and gas 8.4 per cent from November 23, hitting 7.8million homes . Mr Laidlaw repeated the industry's pledge to cut bills if the Government switches environment and social costs to other forms of taxation. Industry sources suggest Chancellor George Osborne could use next month’s autumn statement to cut as much as £75 from bills. Mr Laidlaw insisted he was focused on helping customers struggling to pay bills this winter. More than half a million British Gas customers will receive a special discount of £60 this winter, on top of a £135 warm home discount, he said. Mr Laidlaw said his company had reduced its costs by £300 million over the past few years, and would immediately pass on any reductions in the social and environmental part of energy bills. ‘We are listening - we get it, absolutely. We know there is a problem,’ he said. Recently announced price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . Mr Laidlaw said there was no scope for switching profits from one part of the business to another. Last year Mr Laidlaw was paid a basic salary of £950,000, and received £285,000 in lieu of pension contributions and £71,000 in other benefits. He received an extra £185,000 under the Annual Incentive Scheme, £855,000 under the Deferred Annual Incentive Scheme and £2.6million in Long Term Incentives. He could be in line for long term incentives worth £5million this year, which appear to be unaffected by his promise not to take a bonus. In 2012 Centrica made an operating profit of £2.7billion, up from £2.4billion in 2011. British Gas is not the only firm hiking bills. ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.","Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw admits families are 'under pressure'

Now that Carter is in the race, it is clear that the Republican primary winner will face a well-financed Democrat with many supporters who have long been fans of his family. 'I think there will be a lot of nostalgia for those of us who covered politics in Georgia for a long time,' political analyst Bill Crane told WSBTV. 'It’s a brand in Georgia with staying power and cache, but it’s also a brand that connotes, in a lot of people’s minds, liberalism and a failed presidency.'

On the run: Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed is being hunted by counter-terrorism officers . Theresa May faced criticism in the Commons today after a suspected Islamist terrorist supposedly under close monitoring went on the run wearing a burka. Somalian-born Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed is believed to have evaded police observation by disguising himself as a woman in Islamic dress. The 27-year-old went to pray at a mosque in West London on Friday and has not been seen since, Scotland Yard announced last night. Home Secretary Theresa May face criticism in the Commons today over the ability of the police and security services to track suspects through Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIM) notices. It comes as the Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal probe into electronic tagging contracts handed to G4S and Serco. Police released CCTV pictures of the Mohamed, apparently wearing the traditional garb. Scotland Yard refused to comment on the offences he is suspected of. However they said he was not ‘a direct threat to the public.’ His escape prompted renewed political debate about the role of the appropriateness of Islamic dress in British life. It follows a court case earlier this year in which a woman was required to show her face to jurors and the judge while giving evidence. Mohamed is one of a small number of terror suspects whose movements are restricted by a court order because of the threat they pose to the public. Worryingly, he is the second person under a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures notice to have absconded in the past year. Nine such orders are in force. Islamic clothing: Mohamed is seen leaving the An-Noor Masjid and Community Centre in Acton, west London . The coalition announced in 2011  it would end Labour's control orders regime used to track and disrupt terror suspects. They were replaced by Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMS), which include restrictions on overnight residence, travel and finance. TPIMS are imposed by the Home Secretary who is given access to secret evidence that cannot be placed before juries. They do not allow for the relocation of suspects, as control orders did. Unlike control orders, TPIMS also have a maximum time limit of two years. Control orders could be extended year on year without limit, while TPIMs can be extended after a year for another 12 months before they expire. Some liberty campaigners said TPIMs are control orders-lite, accusing the Government of bottling the decision on the future of counter-terrorism powers. But others, include Labour, complaining that they are not tough enough and allow suspects to move around the country. There were nine TPIMs in force as of August 31, including eight against British suspects. It follows the disappearance on Boxing . Day of Ibrahim Magag who failed to return home on time to comply with . his curfew. He has still not been found. Mohamed's disappeared in a black cab in December after ripping off his electronic tag. His disappearance is a major blow to . police and the security services. The . Metropolitan Police said Mohamed attended the An-Noor Masjid Mosque in . Acton, West London, at 10am on Friday. He was seen inside the mosque at . 3.15pm. A spokesman said he changed into Islamic clothing and ‘has not . been seen since’. A spokesman said: ‘The Counter Terrorism Command immediately launched inquiries to trace Mr Mohamed and these continue. ‘Ports . and borders were notified with his photograph and details circulated . nationally. Public safety remains our priority.’ He said anyone who sees . him should call 999. In . the Commons Mrs May insisted Mohamed does not pose a direct threat to . the British public even though the 27-year-old is understood to have . received training and fought overseas for al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based . cell of the militant Islamist group al Qaida. To . laughs and shouts from the Labour benches, Mrs May said: 'The police . and security service have confirmed that they do not believe that this . man poses a direct threat to the public in the UK. 'The reason he was put on a TPIM in the first place was to prevent his travel to support terrorism overseas.' But Labour's Yvette Cooper said the . disappearance of Magag and Mohamed was proof that the decision to . replace control orders with TPMIs was a mistake. Ms Cooper said: 'Since the Home .

'Her policies brought these two . terror suspects back into contact with their old networks, with people . who could help them disappear and made it easier for these terror . suspects to run off.' She went on: 'TPIMs apply to a very . small number of difficult cases and everyone recognises there was no . perfect answer and there will always be challenges. 'But this Home Secretary has made it easier for serious terror suspects to disappear and that is irresponsible. 'She was warned about changing the . law, she was warned about weakening controls, she was warned more people . would abscond and they have, twice. 'But still she won't act. The question on everyone's lips is how many more warnings does this Home Secretary need?' Mohamed is described as 5ft 8ins tall and of medium build. Magag, . 28, was the first person to go missing while on a TPIM. It was later . claimed he fled simply by jumping into a black cab. The case prompted a . review of how such terror suspects are monitored. TPIMS are a watered down form of control order which allow the courts to place restrictions on a terror suspect’s behaviour. They can be required to obey a curfew, are banned from mixing with named individuals and using the internet. Control orders were watered down in 2011 following demands from the Lib Dems who said they breached civil liberties. Security Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘National security is the Government’s top priority and the police are doing everything in their power to apprehend this man as quickly as possible. ‘The police and security services do not believe that this man poses a direct threat to the public in the UK. ‘The Home Secretary, on police advice, yesterday applied to the High Court for an order protecting anonymity to be lifted in order to assist with their investigation.’","Somalian-born Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed went to pray at mosque .

'I think of branding as using a hot iron heated in coals or a fire,' Reno County District Attorney Keith Schroeder said on Wednesday, adding that the students were not marked with a consistent symbol. 'But I guess if you burn someone with something it is branding. It's a matter of semantics. Whether it leaves a permanent mark or not is unclear.' Hudson and Casanova are both free on bond but Curl is being held in the Reno County Juvenile Detention Center. Reno County Chief Judge Patricia Macke Dick said on Tuesday that Curl's criminal history in the past year gave her sufficient reason to rule he stay in detention. According to The Hutchinson News, Curl is currently on probation for aggravated battery charges from May and September 2012 and has 16 pending burglary, theft and criminal-use-of-a-financial-card charges filed October 21.

The Hutchinson School District said in a statement it does not tolerate hazing and players were warned twice by football coach Randy Dreiling that hazing in any form was forbidden. Dreiling went to police about the hanger incident and the district said it is cooperating with police. District spokesman Ray Hemman told The Hutchison News it was . standard practice for a teacher or coach to be in the locker room when . students are present but couldn't confirm whether one was there when the . alleged branding occurred. He declined to discuss possible punishments for the players, though Reno County Assistant District Attorney Cheryl Allen suggested Curl was suspended for 10 days. Curl's attorney, Greg Bell, opposed . Macke Dick's decision to keep his client in detention, insisting his client was a good student who was about to start work on a construction site and was capable of . self-discipline, something Curl learned as a high school wrestler. But Allen disagreed. 'I . don't see a lot of self-discipline going on because if there were, he . would not have picked up new charges on this,' she told the judge.","Hutchinson, Kansas, football players Kendric Hudson and Jaiden Casanova, both 18, are charged with aggravated battery and hazing .

Smog in China’s most populated city is being blamed for a fertility crisis as the incidence of low sperm counts among its men reaches record levels. Doctors in financial capital Shanghai say air and water pollution is a ‘major culprit’ for the city’s predicament and warn that action needs to be taken urgently. ‘If we don’t protect the environment now, mankind will face a worsening infertility predicament,’ Dr Li Zheng, a sperm expert at the city’s Renji Hospital told the Shanghai Morning Post. Scroll down for video . Shanghai has a population of 23 million people and more than 27 million vehicles. This could be a problem for the financial capital's couples planning families as smog is blamed for rising infertility rates . Only a third of the semen at Shanghai's main sperm bank, run by Dr Li, currently meets World Health Organisation standards. And smog levels are rising. City authorities warned schools to cancel outdoor activities as Shanghai’s air quality levels were reported to be twice as bad as those in Beijing on Thursday. A 2012 study, coordinated by Dr Li, concluded that over the last ten years, worsening environmental conditions were keeping pace with the falling quality of sperm and aspermia, a condition that causes men to produce no semen at all. A year ago, China's infertility rate . stood at 12.5 per cent of people of childbearing age, according to China . state news agency Xinhua. Twenty years ago it was just three per cent.

Scores of families were given the equivalent of a £60,000 salary in benefits until a cap on payments was introduced, it has emerged. More than 19,000 households saw their benefits cut when the £500-a-week limit came into force in April, Department for Work and Pensions figures show. More than 100 had been getting £800 a week, equivalent to a pre-tax salary of £60,000. Seventeen households got more than £900. Ministers said 18,000 people had found jobs since being told they might face a cap 18 months ago. Dozens of households received more than £800-a-week and 17 families were paid £900 or more . Jobcentre: Ministers hope that capping benefits will persuade thousands of people to find work instead . The Department for Work and Pensions released latest figures for the number of people affected by the policy to cap benefits at £26,000 or £500-a-week – the average household income before tax. Ministers argue it is not fair for someone who does not work to have more money than the average person who does have a job. Between the cap being introduced in April and September, 19,276 households have had benefits capped. Of those still affected by the cap in September, just over 300 received more than £700-a-week, or the equivalent of £40,000. Welfare minister Lord Freud said the cap was sending a 'clear message; to those on benefits . Someone in work would need to have a salary of around £60,000 before tax to take home the same amount. Some 17 household receives more than £900-a-week, or £46,800-a-year. A worker with a salary of £70,000 would take home £47,563 after tax and national insurance. More than 7,700 families hit by the cap had more than five children, the largest group of households affected. Welfare Reform minister Lord Freud, said: ‘The benefit cap sends a very clear message that there is a limit to how much the welfare state will provide at £500 a week. ‘We are providing people with a strong incentive to move into work – with our Jobcentre teams now having helped claimants facing the cap for 18 months. ‘It is impressive that 18,000 potentially capped claimants have moved into work and almost 36,000 have accepted Jobcentre Plus help. ‘The benefit cap, along with Universal Credit, will return fairness to the welfare system and ensure that work pays.’ The benefit cap is set at £500 a week for couples, with or without children, and single parents. An adult living alone is limited to £350-a-week. So far 354 such people have been capped. Separate figures today show the chance of being made unemployed is still higher than before the recession. The rate of workers who lose their jobs in each quarter is still higher than before the recession, the Office for National Statistics said .

Behind bars: Alvin Yee, 44, has been sentenced to spend 11 years in jail for prescribing prescription pain medicine too freely . A doctor who treated his patients at a Starbucks has told how he felt what he was doing was fine because plenty of other professionals meet their clients at the coffee chain. Dr Alvin Yee has been sentenced to spend 11 years behind bars for prescribing controlled substances without legitimate medical purpose after undercover agents caught him in the act. The 44-year-old opened up to ABC's Dateline, saying how he didn't see anything wrong with using a Starbucks as a meeting place while he saved money for the funds to buy his own practice. 'There are plenty of lawyers and…other professionals that meet and do business there, and they don't pay rent either,' he told ABC. That wasn't the only problem with Lee's method, however, as he also became the subject of a Drug Enforcement Agency investigation when they found out he being very lax in his prescriptions. He was handing out prescriptions for powerful painkillers like OxyContin and anxiety medication Xanax to patients without doing thorough work ups- and even giving them to people who said that they were picking up the prescriptions for friends who couldn't make it to their appointment. A third of the prescriptions Yee wrote were for people age 25 and younger, prosecutors alleged. More than a habit: Yee was the subject of an eight-month undercover investigation by the DEA who taped conversations of him giving prescriptions to an officer who claimed to be a recovering heroin addict . Pharmacists in the area said in interviews that they refused to honour Yee's prescriptions because 'they considered them outside the scope of a professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose', wrote DEA agent Mark Nomady. Dateline tells how an eight-month undercover DEA investigation was launched, and agents were served by Yee during evening Starbucks clinics across the county. Investigators traced the sale of painkillers to people in Seattle, Phoenix and Detroit. One of the most damning instances came when an agent who was posing as a patient told the doctor that he was a former heroin addict who borrowed painkillers from a friend. Yee told him: 'You won't be having to bum off your friends anymore.' While he admitted that it was wrong of him to give a prescription to a 'friend' of the patient, he felt that his dealing with the 'former addict' was appropriate. Family: Dr Yee, with attorney Lily Allen, who appears to be his wife from pictures on Facebook, had a client base that was mostly younger than 30-years-old . 'There are some people that, if they're not able to get access to their…pain meds that they...result to other ways of treating it, and sometimes it's heroin, so that's one way I rationalized it,' he told ABC. Some of the actual patients who dealt with Yee died while they were receiving his prescriptions, including Derek Rosas. ABC notes that Yee was not charged in Rosas' death, but his mother places some of the blame on the doctor. Yee plead guilty to seven of the 56 counts against him and has now been sentenced to 11 years in jail.","Dr Alvin Yee met with patients and gave neurological examinations to patients at a Starbucks because he didn't have an office .

Pledge: Criminal justice major Tyler Lawrence, 19, lost a testicle following a fraternity initiation ritual in which he was struck in his privates . A 19-year-old Ohio college student pledging to a fraternity has lost a testicle during an alleged hazing ritual. The incident took place on the night of October 30 inside the Gamma Phi Gamma house, dubbed 'Gobbler House,' located off the Wilmington College campus. Tyler Lawrence, 19, was pledging to the Greek organization along with two other young men. According to a police affidavit, about 20 Gamma Phi Gamma members either actively participated in the ritual or watched from the sidelines. Documents cited by The Smoking Gun stated that Lawrence and the other two pledges were blindfolded and led down into the basement of 'Gobbler House,' which had been filled with about 3 inches of water. The trio of pledges were then ordered to lie down on the wet floor and pretend like they were swimming. Afterwards, the men were instructed to remove all of their clothes except for the blindfold. As the students stood naked in the basement, one of the fraternity members allegedly rubbed a substance similar to the muscle balm Icy Hot on their nipples, backs, buttocks and scrotums.

Torment: The pledges were rubbed with an Icy Hot-like substance on their buttocks, nipples and scrotums, and were later forced to eat Limburger cheese (right) As part of the initiation, the pledges had limburger cheese stuffed into their mouths and were ordered to simulate a sexual act with a 'ball of stuffing.’ Things took a dangerous turn when, according to the police affidavit, the fraternity members took towels and shirts that had their ends tied in knots and began hitting the pledges. Lawrence was struck in the testicles and crumpled to the ground, clutching his injured groin in pain, the affidavit stated. The 19-year-old criminal justice major was then helped to his feet, and the rite continued with the brothers stuffing bananas soaked in vinegar into the mouths of the three pledges, who were told that they were eating excrement. Following the 'Gobbler House' initiation, Lawrence complained of severe pain in his groin and was rushed to Clinton Memorial Hospital, where doctors had to cut off a testicle that was damaged in the alleged hazing. The police affidavit also noted that the teenager suffered bruising and contusions to much of his upper body. The following day, police officers arrived at the off-campus frat house armed with a search warrant and seized towels with balled ends, icy-hot balm and other items allegedly used in the initiation. Officials at the Quaker-affiliated liberal arts college have suspended the Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity, which has been active on campus for a century. It is nicknamed ‘Gobbler House’ because its mascot is a turkey. Students who may have participated in the suspected hazing incident could face suspension or expulsion from Wilmington College if convicted of criminal offenses. Crackdown: Wilmington College, the Quaker-affiliated liberal arts institution, has suspended the fraternity pending an investigation . Lawrence, however, has come to the fraternity's defense, denying allegations of hazing and calling what happened a 'freak accident.' ‘Everything is being hyped up,’ he told the station WKRC. Lawrence said he has been accepted into the fraternity after completing the rite of passage, and his parents supported his decision to stay in Gamma Phi Gamma. ‘We're all just sticking together as brothers do,’ he said. ‘I love every one of those guys in there [and] they all love me.’","Wilmington College student Tyler Lawrence, 19, was pledging to Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity .

According to TMZ, the Anger Management star was slapped with a restraining order which contains a gagging clause meaning that if he talks publicly about the case - or the boys' mother Brooke Mueller - again... he's off to prison. The 48-year-old was also warned by the judge: 'Don't forget, I'm Italian!' According to the report, Charlie is forbidden from going within 200 yards of Brooke or contacting her. When told this he apparently replied: 'Thank you.' He may also face a penalty for violating the original gagging order. Brooke, 36, was also in court and had her lawyers try to suspend Sheen's visitation rights to no avail.She also wants Sheen's ex Denise Richards removed as guardian of the four year old boys but that wasn't accepted.

Charlie allegedly told TMZ: 'I am beyond their timid lying morality, therefore I am beyond caring. 'What . my family and I are forced to deal with in the last four years, lives . outside the pale of any acceptable conduct or decency. 'I am battling an . amorphous enemy that needs to be swiftly disempowered.' Denise, 42, was granted temporary custody of Bob and Max after . Brooke was admitted to rehab for the 21st time earlier this year. The pictures emerged as Denise wrote a letter to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to inform them that she will no longer look after the boys because of their violent outbursts towards her daughters and dogs according to TMZ. Violent: While Denise Richards took in Charlie Sheen's sons earlier this year when their mother went to rehab, she says she can no longer care for them after they started attacking her daughters and dogs . The James Bond actress reportedly blames Brooke completely for the boys’ behaviour and TMZ reports she revealed they have lashed out at her and Charlie's daughters, Sam, nine, and Lola, eight, as well as her adopted child Eloise, two. The website says Denise claims her daughters have been 'strangled, kicked in the head and stomach, scratched, bit, slapped, punched in the face and head, and spit on by Bob and Max’. She also alleges they have thrown their own faeces at her daughters. After visiting Brooke, Bob is said to have thrown a toy at Sam which left her needing medical attention. Blame: Denise blames Bob and Max's mother Brooke Mueller (pictured here in 2011) for their violent outbursts and claims the children are traumatised after visiting her . They . are also said to have attacked Denise’s dogs, with TMZ reporting they . ‘repeatedly kick her dogs in the head and squeeze their heads with both . hands while watching the dogs whimper in pain. Strained:  Brooke recently sought a restraining order against Charlie while he has hit out calling her a 'whore' 'The kids will flip from sweetly petting the dog to strangling the animals and lifting them off the ground by the neck’. The twins, who Denise says often go into a 'zombie-like state', are said to have told her they ‘wanted to hurt and kill the dogs’. But their behaviour is not limited to home with Bob, in particular, reportedly attacking fellow students and teachers at the school they started in November. According to TMZ, Denise attributes the bad behaviour to time spent with Brooke and says the twins suffer terrible nightmares after spending time at her home. Richards claims she has been advised to get counselling for the twins but Brooke has refused to allow it. TMZ reports that the actress took an email to the L.A. Department of Children and Family Services written by Dr. Jay Gordon, an Assistant Professor of Paediatrics at UCLA Medical School. 'As we have discussed, because of recent events involving the boys' behaviour I think that they need urgent evaluation,' the email states. 'I am very concerned . about their escalating violent actions; The apparent lack of . understanding of the consequences and the safety of others is most . worrisome. ' The doctor then recommends 'a complete developmental and behavioural assessment' by a paediatric psychiatrist. But Denise alleges that Brooke is trying to 'block the treatment for Bob and Max' recommended in the email. The parents: Charlie is concerned about letting drug addict and rehab hopper Brooke have access to the twins and has lashed out calling her a 'whore' and a 'chubby weirdo', seen right in September . News of Denise’s letter comes just . after Charlie, 48, branded Brooke a ‘chubby weirdo’ following her failed . attempt to secure a restraining order against him in court on Monday. He . wrote on Twitter: ‘Oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. ‘you . are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me . and my boys (sic)’ He also posted a bizarre 'birthday' message to her on Tuesday, even though Brooke turned 36 in August. He . captioned a picture of a grenade on top of a cake with the words: . 'happy Bday Brooke when you're done sucking off the parking lot at Home . Depot why don't ya 'blow' out this candle. c' According to TMZ, the petition claims Charlie said: ‘There will be a reckoning. There will be a whirlwind. That they will all reap while desperate begging for my forgiveness. You've all been warned. ‘I will exercise every resource at my . disposal. I will, I will, I will, I will empty my entire war chest and . if I can't get it done, I know a guy who can.’ A follow-up hearing has been set for next month. At . the weekend, Denise was reportedly informed by the DCFS that she was . not allowed to take the children over to the actor's house for a visit. A . source claimed that officials told the actress that they were annoyed . with Charlie after he claimed his sons were in danger and were not being . protected by the department after they were allowed an overnight stay . with Brooke. The 48-year-old actor blasted Brooke on Twitter as an ‘evil and pathetic uber loser’ and slammed the DCFS as being ‘inept’. Uncertain future: It is unclear what exactly will happen to the twins if Denise asks for them to be removed from her home .","Judge warns Sheen: 'Don't forget I'm Italian'

The Hindu temple has a colossal main area, which measures 141 foot high and 316 foot wide . Insight: Camilla pictured during a tour of the temple . The main monument is 'supported' by 148 elephants, which have huge importance in Hindu culture . Of its 1,350 pupils aged three to 17, 98 per cent pass their state exams while 56 per cent go on to university. Indeed, pictures of the non-profit school's success stories are pinned to the walls - along with how much they are now earning. One, a young woman called Gayatri, has . just taken her civil service exams and now works in the Indian . government's customs office earning 50,000 rupees a month.

Celebration: Prince Charles is presented with a framed birthday card . The Katha pupils gave Prince Charles a cake with '65' in chocolate on top . He and his wife quickly went inside for a tour of the impressively clean facilities, chatting with some of the adorably excited nursery age children. The Prince told teacher Sudhir Jha he was ‘very impressed’ with the school's bilingual approach and its focus on lifting people out of poverty. Among the students they met was Kumar, 32, who was living with seven other people in one room when he joined a bakery course at the school. Now he is working in a restaurant earning 35,000 rupees a month and has moved out of the slum into a house of his own. ‘If it wasn't for the school I don't know what I would have done with myself,’ he said. ‘Thanks to them I am doing so well.’ He is still single, but has no plans to marry yet. ‘I want to get into a chain of hotels and become a big shot chef,’ he said. ‘Then I will think about settling down.’ During another part of the visit, the Katha schoolchildren kicked off Charles' 65th birthday celebrations early when they presented him with a home-made Black Forest gateau. Pupils gave him the cake with '65' in chocolate on top a week ahead of his pensionable birthday next week. The prince will celebrate his birthday on the last day of his nine-day tour to India before flying to Sri Lanka to represent the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The cake was made by catering students at the 1,300 pupil school under the tutelage of local Master chef Ram Kumar. One of the trainee bakers said they had out five eggs in the mix for a high cholesterol treat. The couple eventually went their separate ways with Camilla visiting workshops for young women training to be seamstresses and designers, while Charles viewed children learning computer skills. The Duchess asked the women to show them their skills and even tried her hand at some silk printing. The couple left after around 20 minutes, their convoy speeding through the dusty streets. Meet and greet: Charles speaks with a student during his visit to Katha Lab School . Prince Charles during his visit to the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun . While Charles went for a private lunch with the Vice President of India, Shri M Hamid Ansari, his wife went to the home of the British High Commissioner where she met with women from the Self-Employed Women's (SEWA). The Duchess was greeted with a welcome symbol painted out in red and white powder on the ground called a Rangoli.

The cocoons are especially cultivated and then boiled for the women to spin from. They can earn up to 800 rupees (£8) for a piece of cloth through SEWA, double what they would normally earn. Camilla then teamed up with her husband to visit one of the world's largest temples, Akshardham, opened in 2005. As . they arrived they were given garlands of fragrant frangipani, while . Charles was anointed with a red dot on his forehead known as a chandlos . by a Swami (or priest) and given a friendship bracelet.

Increasing numbers of people are now claiming for help from foodbanks as more families than ever find themselves suffering from poverty. In one trust alone, more than 350,000 people were given a three-day food package - three times as many as the same time last year. The Trussell Trust has written to the Prime Minister calling on him to look into the 'scandalous' problem of food poverty, warning some foodbank recipients are so poor they have returned produce that needs cooking because they cannot afford the electricity to heat it up. Southwark Foodbank in London, the Trussell Trust has called on David Cameron to launch an inquiry into food poverty . Trussell Trust executive chairman . Chris Mould said: 'We said in April that the increasing numbers of . people turning to foodbanks should be a wake-up call to the nation, but . there has been no policy response and the situation is getting worse. The level of food poverty in the UK is not acceptable. 'It's . scandalous and it is causing deep distress to thousands of people. The . time has come for an official and in-depth inquiry into the causes of . food poverty and the consequent rise in the usage of foodbanks. 'As a nation we need to accept that something is wrong and that we need to act now to stop UK hunger getting worse.' Chancellor George Osborne has said that more people are using foodbanks because they are told about them at jobcentres . Earlier this year, Chancellor George Osborne suggested foodbank use had increased 'because people have been made aware of the foodbank service through local jobcentres'. But the Trust has echoed concerns that some households will have to choose between eating and heating this winter as they struggle to cope with the rising costs of food and energy. It also highlights the impact of welfare reforms that came into force in April, reporting an increase in referrals as a result of the so-called 'bedroom tax'. Mr Mould said: ""Problems with welfare are not new, they have existed for years, but the reality is that when welfare provision breaks down, people go hungry. 'We're talking about mums not eating for days because they've been sanctioned for seemingly illogical reasons, or people leaving hospital after a major operation to find that their benefits have been stopped or delayed. 'It's not right that so many more . people are now being referred to foodbanks due to problems with welfare, . especially as much of this is preventable. 'This is not about pointing fingers, it's about finding solutions. That's why we believe an inquiry is now essential.' Chris . Johnes, Oxfam's UK poverty programme director, said: 'These figures lay . bare the shocking scale of destitution, hardship and hunger in the UK. 'It . is completely unacceptable that in the seventh wealthiest nation on the . planet, the number of people turning to foodbanks has tripled. 'Oxfam . welcomes The Trussell Trust's call for the Prime Minister to launch an . urgent inquiry into why people are forced to turn to foodbanks.' Food poverty: Food is packed ready to be distributed to needy families . TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady described the figures as 'shocking'. She said: 'The Chancellor is talking up a recovery - but for who? These new figures show that, despite trying desperately hard to make ends meet, hundreds of thousands of people still can't afford to put food on the table for their families. 'Welfare reforms like the Bedroom Tax have pushed more households into food poverty.' A Government spokesman said: 'We have taken action to help families with the cost of living, including increasing the tax-free personal allowance to £10,000 which will save a typical taxpayer over £700, freezing council tax for five years and freezing fuel duty. 'The Trussell Trust itself says it is opening three new foodbanks every week, so it's not surprising more people are using them. They also agree that awareness has helped to explain their recent growth. 'The benefits system supports millions of people who are on low incomes or unemployed and there is no robust evidence that welfare reforms are linked to increased use of food banks. 'In fact, our welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities with the Universal Credit making three million households better off - the majority of these from the bottom two fifths of the income scale.' Figures published today by food redistribution charity FareShare show the organisation is facing record levels of demand for its services and providing food to more organisations than ever before . FareShare redistribute surplus food up and down the country, feeding more than 50,000 people a day. In the wake of increased demand the charity revealed that Tesco is to provide the equivalent of seven million meals a year to the hundreds of charities across the UK that FareShare works with. The supermarket chain announced it is planning to divert all surplus fresh food from its distribution centres and online grocery centres to support the charity.","More than 350,000 sought help in the past six months .

The pastor of a North Carolina megachurch has built a $1.7 million mansion for himself and his family which he told his congregation at Sunday's sermon is a 'gift from God.' Elevation Church Pastor Steven Furtick, 33, is unapologetic about his ostentatious new seven-and-a-half bathroom, 16,000-square-foot home built on 19 acres in Weddington. He spent the first part of his sermon talking about the controversy surrounding its construction and apologizing to his parishioners for any 'uncomfortable conversations,' they may have been forced to have about it. New home: Pastor Stephen Furtick and his wife Holly are building their dream home - a 16,000-square-foot, seven-and-a-half bathroom mansion on 19 acres . Secluded: The property, set in acres of forest, sits behind an electric gate with a 'No Trespassing' sign . Construction: The huge home is being built on land surrounded by thick forest . No entry: The private drive leading to Furtick's opulent new home in North Carolina . 'My wife and I made a decision, and we built a house,' he said while sitting at the edge of the stage at the church’s Blakeney location. 'It’s a big house, and it’s a beautiful house, and we thank God for it... We understand everything we have comes from God.' Stephen Furtick began Elevation Church in 2006 with attendance at his first service of 121 people. Since then, the start-up has become a going concern, attracting more than 12,000 people each week. Furtick himself is part of the new breed of celebrity preacher, with his own brand - books, television and highly paid personal appearances. His wife Holly has a blog called 'The Preacher's Wife,' in which she writes about Elevation Church, dispenses marriage and fashion advice and gives readers insights into her husband's life. Family compound: 'Father Steven' will live in his brand new mansion with his wife and three children . Well-traveled: Furtick and his wife Holly spend a lot of time traveling to Furtick's speaking engagements around the world . Celebrity preacher: Part of a new breed of 'prosperity preacher,' Furtick is a brand, with his own books, television appearances, highly paid guest speaking roles and a Twitter account with more than 100,000 followers . Rockstar: The shepherd of Jesus' flock is a born performer and uses his stadium shows to promote his books . Transcending the church he started, Furtick has 183,191 Twitter followers, while Elevation Church has 45,469. Furtick and his right-hand man, Elevation CFO and 'executive pastor' James 'Chunks' Corbett will not disclose how much money Furtick is paid by the tax-exempt Elevation Church, his tax-free housing allowance, or how much he has made from books and speaking engagements. His salary and benefits are not set by his congregation or a congregation-elected panel of elders but rather by an 'appointed' board that consists entirely of other megachurch pastors. Warren Smith Cole, an author who has written about Elevation Church told NBC Charlotte the financial well-being of the group of pastors is 'intimately intertwined'. 'They attend each other’s conferences and are compensated for that regularly,' he said. The showman: Holly and Steven Furtick in London earlier this year . When Furtick held his 12-day preach-fest Code Orange Revival last year, three of the headliners, pastors Stovall Weems of Jacksonville, Florida, Perry Noble of Anderson, South Carolina, and Kevin Gerald of Seattle, were all board members at Elevation. They are three of the five board members who set Furtick's salary. 'Chunks' Corbett told NBC Charlotte that pastors get paid for appearances at Elevation Church, but said the pay is 'small in scope,' and refused to disclose the amounts. Furtick's name does not appear on the deed to the house. Instead, it's under the name of Jumper Driver Revocable Trust 1, and the trustee is 'Chunks' Corbett. Corbett says the reason for this is for 'the privacy and security of the family.' Bestsellers: Furtick will not disclose how much he has made in book sales . Furtick addressed the media interest in his new home in last week's sermon, too. 'It started to mess with me a little bit because I thought this ain't right. I didn't even build that house with money from the church. I built it with money from my books and I gave money to the church from the books and you start getting real defensive and being like this ain't right. This ain't right,' Furtick said. The claim that the house and land were paid for with proceeds from his books may be true, but NBC North Carolina reports that Furtick's books are inextricably linked with Elevation Church, which paid for full-page ads promoting them and to air sermons featuring the books on TV. Furtick sold vast copious copies of the book at his author's discount to his congregation and ran a 'promotion' - for every sale of his book Greater, he gave a backpack to a poor child. Father Steven: Furtick is father to three children: Graham and Elijah (pictured) and Abbey . Elevation Church says that it undergoes a yearly voluntary audit by accounting firm C. Dewitt Foard and Col, PA, but the results of that audit are not released and NBC Charlotte reports that employees and volunteers at the church must sign a confidentiality agreement which threatens to sue if they disclose information about the church's finances. For all this though, Furtick's devoted congregation, called 'elevators,' seemed unperturbed. When he apologized for any 'difficult conversations,' a woman close to the front said, 'No sorries needed.' And when he told the congregation he intended to continue his ministry in Charlotte for the 'next 50 years,' he was greeted by whoops and cheers. Church member Cora Morgan told the Charlotte Observer that she doesn’t think his congregation has any right to tell him what kind of house to build. 'It’s his money; he can do what he wants with it,' she said. Warren Smith Cole told NBC Charlotte: 'If Steven Furtick's followers in the congregation at Elevation want to . pay him these outlandish salaries and want to allow him to live in . multi-million dollar homes, that's up to them.They're the . ones contributing the money. But they should know that.'","Pastor Steven Furtick of the Elevation megachurch in North Carolina has built a $1.7 million home .

The 92-year-old wore a chestful of military awards as he accompanied the Queen to open the new base of the charity formerly known as the Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen Families Association at Queen Elizabeth House in central London. The Duke, who joined the Royal Navy straight from school in 1939 and was decorated for his bravery in the Second World War before leaving when his wife ascended the throne in 1952, today joked with a young soldier who lost both legs in Afghanistan, telling him he ought to get some wheels. Heavily-decorated: The Duke of Edinburgh, who served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War, wore 17 medals and decorations to visit the new SSAFA charity HQ in central London today . You should get yourself some wheels: The 92-year-old Duke joked with amputee Trooper Cayle Royce, 27 . Trooper Cayle Royce, who lost both legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan last year, said meeting Philip was an honour. 'He’s my hero,' the 27-year-old South African soldier said.  'He’s just a great person - really comedy.' Asked why he was laughing with the Duke, he said: 'He told me I should lose the feet and put some wheels on my prosthetics. 'He said it will be easier to get around.' The Duke wore his full complement of decorations to comply with organisers' request that all guests wear medals. His include the Greek War Cross Of Honour, awarded for his bravery in the Battle of Cape Matapan against the Italian Navy in 1941.  Aged just 19, he operated the searchlights against the Italians during a bloody gun battle in which he said later 'all hell broke loose', and he was Mentioned in Despatches for his courage. Today Philip and the Queen both spoke to Trooper Royce, who is planning to row 3,000 miles with another amputee soldier across the Atlantic next month. Little Hayley Inns, six, whose brother Rifleman Martin Kinggett died in Afghanistan in 2010, met the Queen . Military occasion: The Queen was greeted by her cousin, the charity's president, Prince Michael of Kent . The soldier with the Light Dragoons, who now lives in Dartmouth, said he spoke to the monarch about how his Row2Recovery challenge has been supported by a grant from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry’s charitable organisation, The Royal Foundation. Having been patron of SSAFA for 60 years, the Queen was given a medal to mark the occasion. General Sir Kevin O’Donoghue, SSAFA’s chairman, joked as he presented it to her: 'See it as a variation of a Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.' The Queen, who was greeted by her cousin, Prince Michael of Kent, who is the charity’s president, also unveiled a plaque at the charity's headquarters in St Dunstan’s Hill. After meeting various charity beneficiaries, volunteers and staff, she was given a posy by six-year-old Harley Inns, whose brother, Rifleman Martin Kinggett, was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. Rifleman Kinggett, from 4th Battalion The Rifles, died of a gunshot wound while giving covering fire for an injured colleague. Harley, who wore her brother’s service medals, said the Queen asked her: 'Are those for me?' The schoolgirl was joined by her mother, Lisa, father, Craig and sister, Georgia, 16, as she presented the Queen with the flowers, which she said was 'fun'. The Queen wore a kingfisher blue jacquard dress and wool crepe detailed coat by Peter Enriole and a matching hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan.

A woman desperate to become the world's biggest bride has embarked upon a 30,000 calorie a day diet in order to achieve her dream. Susanne Eman, 33, weighs in at a staggering 520lbs - but says she needs to fatten up for her wedding day. Unlike . most figure-conscious brides-to-be, in preparation for her final wedding dress fitting, Susanne feasted on an enormous . breakfast of pancakes, Belgian waffles, hash browns, sausage links, . steak, and a giant 12-egg omelette. Scroll down for video . Larger than life: Susanne Eman, the 800lb mother who is half way to reaching the record for being the fattest woman has been fitted for her wedding gown ahead of her nuptials to chef Parker Clack . Tucking in: The mother of two eats three guacamole bacon cheeseburgers, two orders of chili cheese fries, nine tacos, a chocolate shake and a large Coke . On the day of her appointment with . the . seamstress, Susanne and her sister Cassie, who will be Susanne's . maid-of-honour when she marries her chef boyfriend, Parker Clack, 35, . later this year, made a pit stop for snacks, arriving at the . dressmaker's with a spread of three guacamole bacon . cheeseburgers, two orders of chili cheese fries, nine tacos, a chocolate . shake and a large Coke. The monumental challenge of making a . dress to fit the bride's XXXXXXXXXL figure was given to dressmaker Judee . Goff, who calculated after measuring Susanne that she would need 45ft . of fabric to complete the dress. Now Judee has designed . the world's largest wedding gown for her larger than life client, using endless billowing lengths of chiffon . and lace to cover Susanne's colossal curves. The one-off gown is so large it takes three people to carry it, and half an hour to lace up at the back. Seamstress . Judee, from Paradise Fabrics in Phoenix, Arizona, said: 'Right now, it . just fits snugly, and if she gains weight it will lace up looser in the . back. 'We've never made a dress like this before. There are no dress patterns this large.' Susanne said: 'When I tried the dress on, it was amazing, I felt like a bride. Love at first bite: Susanne Eman and Parker Clack met online and bonded over their shared love of food . Happiness: The morbidly obese heavyweight believes that her goal of becoming the fattest human will remove the stigma that fat is bad seeing as she believes she is healthy, her sons are happy and she has found love . Susanne's . sister Cassie said: 'I think she looks . really beautiful in it. The dress turned out amazing.' She said: 'I've never been married before and this is the first time I've tried on a wedding dress. 'Parker hasn't seen me in it, but he's seen photos and says I look beautiful. 'He . hasn't formally proposed with a ring yet, as he wants to surprise me. But we've agreed we're getting married, and he's just waiting for the . right moment.' Susanne, who has given herself ten years to eat her way into the Guinness Book of Records, had believed until recently that she weighed nearly 800lbs after spending a year . gorging on fast food, cakes, pasta, pizza, crisps and fatty . snacks. Fit? Ms Eman tries to stay mobile and healthy by swimming and 'waddling' and though her doctors warn her against pursuing her dream of creaking the record, she believes she in no danger . Incapacitated: Susanne's sister Cassie, who will be maid-of-honour on Susanne's big day, has to push her sister in a wheelchair to the dress fitting . But after recently being weighed . on special obesity scales, Susanne discovered to her disappointment that her weight was actually 520lbs - almost 1,000lbs short of her goal weight of 1,600lbs. Now Susanne has her own goal for the . big day: to put on weight. In order to ekep gaining the pounds, Susanne must eat 30,000 calories a day, which she gets from meals cooked for her by her husband-to-be. Susanne's doctor is opposed to his patient's morbid mission  - but Susanne believes she can reach her target weight . without endangering her life. Susanne says she wants to try to 'break the stigma that . being fat is bad'. 'It's helped me to find love, so what's wrong with . that?' she said. Now that she has her wedding gown in . her sights, Susanne is hoping her chef boyfriend Parker will formally . propose so they can start planning their big day. Customising: Seamstress Judy Goff has to use about 45 feet of fabric to make the dress for the Arizona native . Sizeable: Ms Eman's waist measures a staggering 107.5in, or nine feet, around making this surely one of the biggest wedding dresses ever made . Don't breathe out! Ms Goff anticipates the extra inches when the bride sits down in her gown . 'It's amazing to have something designed especially for me. Normally I just buy my clothes from plus-size stores online. 'I talked over designs with the dressmaker and she came up with a dress I've always dreamed of. After having the girth of her 9ft . waist measured, Susanne tried on veils and head pieces, talking . excitedly about her expectations for the wedding. 'I'm feeling like a bride. I can't . wait,' she gushed. 'I like an off-whitish, not completely white. Because . if I wear completely white, I guarantee I'm going to spill something on . it.' 'I . can't wait for Parker to buy me a ring so we can start planning a . wedding date, and things like the flowers, venue, and the cake.' Susanne, who earns a living by posting photographs for male fans online, met Parker over the internet last year. 'I felt like a real bride!' Susanne was overwhelmed with emotion when she tried on the fabric for her wedding dress . After sharing emails and phone calls, the couple began dating, and Parker moved in to Susanne's apartment a few months later. Now . the couple are inseparable, and Parker, who is currently looking for . work, spends his days making delicious dishes, including his signature . spaghetti bolognese, for Susanne. He said: 'Susanne looked beautiful . in her dress. I love big women, but I do worry about her health and I . try to make sure she eats some salad and does her exercises. While details of the catering menu . for the big event is not known, the couple insist that despite the . gargantuan quantity of food consumed by Susanne, she likes to eat . healthily. Mr Clack has said of her ambition: 'I support her because it makes her happy, and I love big women. 'I . do worry about her health of course, but I try to make sure she eats . some healthy food like salad, and I make sure she does exercises. She's . taken up swimming since we met and we love to swim together.' 'I want her to be around for a long time after our wedding.' Susanne, . who has two sons, Gabriel, 16, and Brendin, 12, added: 'I'd love to . have a nice wedding somewhere local, not too big and not too small, but . with all my family and friends around me.' Tight fit: Susanne struggles into her car on the way to her appointment with the dressmaker . Vast: Judy Goff unrolls 15 feet of fabric but will need three times that amount to make a dress even despite the fact that it will be sleeveless as per the bride's wishes .

"By . Emma Thomas . PUBLISHED: . 09:12 EST, 8 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:39 EST, 8 November 2013 . An entrepreneur says hackers stole $1million of the virtual currency bitcoin from his website. The Australian man, who refused to be identified citing fears for his safety, said thieves compromised his site and took a haul of virtual currency. Bitcoin is a digital-only currency traded from computer to computer and is usually used to pay for goods online. Theft: $1million bitcoins were stolen from an Australian man's website . The alleged theft is one of the largest since bitcoin was created four years ago. Bitcoin has no central authority and is not backed by governments or banks. A bitcoin user who calls himself TradeFortress told ABC more than 4,100 bitcoins worth about $1.1million (£585,000) were stolen from him. He says he is not much older than 18 and he knows the chances of getting any of the digital currency back is unlikely because all bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed. As the transactions are all anonymous, speculation has arisen that this was an inside job and TradeFortress took the coins for himself. However, the young man strenously denied the allegations - but admitted he was unlikely to report the theft to police. Digital: Bitcoin is presented as a payment method at e-commerce companies on a website in Berlin . 'The police don't have access to any more information than any user does when it comes to bitcoin. Some say it gives them control of their money,' he explained. The $1.1million bitcoins were owned by users of his website who had trusted him to look after their digital currency. A spokesman for the Australian Federal Police says to his knowledge, a theft of bitcoins has never been investigated but if it was reported to officers then police would investigate it like any other theft. Experts say as the popularity of bitcoins increases, thieves will look to hack into the system and exploit the currency's anonymous nature. Stilgherrian, a technology commentator, said unlike stocks or bonds, bitcoins are very hard to trace. 'Once you've got the bitcoin there's no way, well no easy way, of telling where you got that from,' he said. 'So from a money laundering point of view, it's very attractive. Going mainstream? A customer uses the world's first ever permanent bitcoin ATM unveiled at a coffee shop in Vancouver, Canada . 'We're talking about roughly a million dollars worth of bitcoin gone. That puts it up there with some of the biggest bank robberies in history.' A bitcoin is worth about $275 (£161). At the beginning of the year, they were worth about $30 (£17) each. Sthilgarian says the popularity of the digital currency is making stealing it more attractive to crooks. 'People rob banks because that's where the money is, your bitcoin wallet which is really just a digital file sitting on your computer, can be just as vulnerable and just as attractive,' he said. 'And the more of it that is out there, the more thieves will be drawn to it.'","Bitcoin is a digital-only currency traded from computer to computer .

Arrested: Marion County High School teacher and football coach Michael Schmitt has been accused of spray painting his team's field house . When a Tennessee high school football field house was vandalized about two weeks ago, authorities suspected the culprits were from a rival team. But in a shocking twist, police yesterday arrested the school's own football coach, Michael Schmitt. The father-of-four allegedly wanted to inspire his Marion County High School players before a big game. His team lost. Schmitt, 39, is accused of scrawling vulgarities across the field house, storage building and on the concrete parking lot in the early-morning hours of November 1. His team was due to play the South Pittsburg prep football team that day. The schools' rivalry is one of the oldest and most heated in Tennessee. The suspect used black and orange spray - the school colors of the South Pittsburg Pirates - causing about $7,000 in damage. The derogatory messages named individual coaches and trashed the town, Deadspin reported. One read, 'Only p*****s wear purple', the Marion County school colors, and another said, 'f**k this house'. Large power 'Ps' - South Pittsburg's logo - were painted on the buildings . to make it look like Pirates supporters were the culprits, according to Chattanooga Times. Prisoners from Marion County clean up the field house which had allegedly been vandalized by Marion County High School assistant football coach Michael Schmitt . The suspect used black and orange spray paint - the school colors of the South Pittsburg Pirates football team - to vandalize the field house . According to his profile on the Marion County High School website, Schmitt is a father of four with a social sciences degree . However South Pittsburg was quick to deny its involvement. 'Our senior captains came to me and asked if they could go up there and help clean it up because they're as embarrassed as I am and they don't want people thinking we allow thugs like that in our school,' South Pittsburg's principal Danny Wilson said, according to Deadspin. 'We warned all of our kids at school yesterday to stay out of Jasper, and I hope they can identify who it was, because if it was any of our kids we will drop the full hammer on them.' The tight-knit community was shocked by Schmitt's arrest. 'It is sad to say that this event gives . the whole community a black eye and the real victims of this incident . are the kids from both schools,' Marion County Sheriff's Detective . Matt Blansett said. Officers claim the vandalism . was an attempt to inspire the Marion County football team before its . game. The team ended up losing to the Pirates, 35-17. The Sheriff's department would not . confirm whether other coaches were involved. It is likely the suspect was identified in surveillance footage. Schmitt was arrested and booked into the Marion County jail on charges of vandalism of $1,000 to $10,000. He was released on $2,500 bond. Deadspin reported Schmitt has been suspended without pay pending his January court appearance. His profile is still listed on the school's website. 'It's very unfortunate if it comes out to be a factual case against Mr. Schmitt. Very unfortunate for students to act that way, much less adults,' Marion County Schools Superintendent Mark Griffith told WRCB.","Tennessee high school buildings vandalized on November 1 .

An MIT-educated tech pioneer who has a set of augmented-reality glasses bolted to his head says he was assaulted by three employees at a McDonald's in Paris, who tried to rip the device off his face. Steve Mann captured the entire incident on his EyeTap device as his assailants demanded to know what the bizarre invention did and why he was wearing it. The irony is that the only reason the camera on the invention stored the image of the perpetrators is because they broke it as they roughly shoved him out the door. Mr Mann says the EyeTap would not have otherwise kept the data on its hard drive. Augmented: Dr Steve Mann, a University of Toronto professor, has been wearing augmented vision computers for 35 years as part of his research. He has also come up with the MindMesh (left) as a means to controlling a computer directly with branwaves . Assault: The three men, one wearing a McDonad's shirt, another with a McDonald's name tag, not visible, demanded to know why Dr Mann had the glasses . Mr Mann was in McDonald's in Paris when the incident happened and hopes some staff will come forward to help . Dr Mann, a professor at the University of Toronto, is a leader in the field of augmented reality. He has worn a pair of computerized glasses for 35 years, he says, in an effort to develop a device that can help the blind and the nearly-blind see. The device is bolted to his skull and requires special tools to remove. It records video and streams it, with augmented data, directly onto his retina. He posted his account of the incident on blog after repeated attempts to contact McDonald's about the incident left him empty handed. He says he only wants the company to pay for the device's replacement. Dr Mann's EyeTap Digital Eye Glass was first developed in 1999 -- 13 years before Google introduced its vaunted Google Glass augmented reality technology earlier this years. Questioned: This manager immediately questioned Dr Mann when he and his family entered the restaurant while they were on holiday in Paris . Broken: The irony is that the eyepiece would not have recorded the encounter if the employees had not broken it and caused it to store its final images . Dr Mann says he took his family to McDonald's on the Champs Elysee while on vacation to Paris last month. Immediately, an employee questioned him about his eye wear. Dr Mann said he had brought along a note from his doctor to explain the device because he spent the day touring museums and famous landmarks. This was the only time during his trip that anyone demanded to see documentation. The first employee was satisfied by the documents and let the family order. However, when they sat down to eat, another employee came over and tried to rip the glasses off Dr Mann's face, he said. Two others then tore up Dr Mann's doctor's note and other documents and pushed him out of the restaurant. VIDEO: Steve Mann explains the EyeTap .","Dr Steve Mann is a professor at the University .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:32 EST, 15 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:58 EST, 15 November 2013 . Michael Phelps still can't bring himself to utter the word 'comeback.' Yet all signs point to the world's greatest swimmer returning to the pool for the 2016 Rio Olympics. In the strongest signal yet that his retirement won't last much longer, Phelps has rejoined the U.S. drug testing program — a necessary step for any athlete hoping to compete in an Olympic sport. Return? One of the most successful Olympians ever could be ready to come out of retirement . 'I have no idea what's going to . happen,' Phelps told The Associated Press in an exclusive telephone . interview from Minneapolis, where he was attending an Arena Grand Prix . meet and even got in some impromptu training in the diving well. 'If I . really do start getting excited and wanting to do it, I can make that . choice. If not, at least it's something we can say we prepared for.' Phelps . said he's merely giving himself the option of competing again and . stressed that 'nothing is set in stone.' But the doping program is a . major inconvenience, requiring him to be available for random testing . and keep officials apprised of his whereabouts. Powerhouse: Phelps won 18 gold medals in his peerless career in the pool . 'It is a challenging thing to do,' he said. 'We are covering all the bases just in case.' Phelps . has won the most and is indeed the most decorated athlete in Olympic . history. He captured 18 gold medals and 22 medals overall at the last . three Summer Games, shattering the previous marks. He is best known for . breaking Mark Spitz's record for a single Olympics by winning eight gold . medals at Beijing in 2008. The . U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said Phelps was among the athletes who . underwent doping tests in the third quarter, the period ending Sept. 30. He was tested twice. His . longtime coach and close friend, Bob Bowman, said Phelps actually . re-entered the doping program near the end of the second quarter, but he . wasn't tested and therefore wasn't listed in that USADA report. He . would be eligible to compete again in March, according to Bowman. 'I . just think he's in a place where he's feeling good about swimming,' Bowman said. 'If he chooses to compete, he's got some time. I like . having the ability to do it. To be perfectly honest, he's not anywhere . near being able to compete in a meet or anything like that. We're just . getting started on improving his fitness. We'll see where that goes.' Powerhouse: Phelps won 18 gold medals in his peerless career in the pool . Phelps . has been training with Bowman's team at the North Baltimore Aquatic . Club. Each week, he's been working a couple of days in the pool, a . couple of days in the weight room, and one or two days on his core . training. He has lost about 15 pounds and is back in the low 190s, not . far off his competition weight. 'If . I decide to keep going and swim again, then I'll compete,' he said. 'If . I don't,' he added, letting out a big laugh, 'I guess I'll re-retire. Just don't compare me to Brett Favre.' A possible . comeback by the 22-time Olympic medallist has been mooted for a good . year with fellow American Ryan Lochte vocal for some time that his . friend and rival would return to the pool. That would appear now to be the case with the Baltimore swimmer having already undergone two doping tests. By . subjecting himself to drug testing, the 28-year-old Phelps has given . himself plenty of time to go through an entire season before the next . major meet, the 2015 world championships in Russia, an important . steppingstone to the Rio Games the following summer. FINA, the world . governing body for swimming, requires an athlete to be tested for at . least nine months before taking part in sanctioned events. USADA said Phelps was among the athletes who underwent doping tests in the period ending September 30. It means the 28-year-old will be eligible to compete in the trials for the World Championships in Kazan in 2015. 'There's no grand scheme,' Bowman said. 'It just sort of makes sense that he can make some choices if he wants to.' No 1: But can Phelps be on top of the world again in Brazil in 2016 . Phelps . attended the world championships in Barcelona this past summer, but he . seemed even more pumped about being on hand for one of the more mundane . events that fall between the Olympic years. 'Just . being around this is exciting for me,' he said from Minneapolis. 'It . really has been a part of my life ever since I was a kid.' Phelps' return would surely be welcomed by the entire sport and even those who only follow swimming during the Olympics. 'I . think it would be great for the sport,' said Conor Dwyer, a relay gold . medalist at the London Games who trains with Phelps at North Baltimore. 'He elevated it so much before that I think it can only get bigger with . him in it. Obviously he's the greatest swimmer of all time — doubled . everyone's medal counts — so to have him on your relay only helps the . USA win more golds.' At the World Championships in . Barcelona last summer when asked of a comeback, Phelps said: 'If anybody . would know about me coming back it would be myself and I haven't said . one thing to anybody about anything. 'But I am here watching it, enjoying myself. 'I enjoying playing golf, I enjoy getting up at noon- it's a good life.' While apparently exasperated by such questions, it seems Phelps was already looking ahead. A possible rematch with Chad Le Clos . is intriguing, the South African who had pictures of Phelps on his wall . as a child before taking his 200 metres butterfly crown in London. Possibly this is one of Phelps' motivations. New king in town: Chad Le Clos took Phelps' 200m butterfly crown in London 2012 . Phelps' appeal goes far beyond the pool deck. His recognition factor has often . matched athletes from far more prominent sports, such as NBA star LeBron . James, a truly impressive accomplishment for a swimmer. Phelps . retired after winning six more medals at last summer's London Olympics, . adamant that all his goals were met and he had no desire to still be . swimming in his 30s. He will be 31 by the time of the opening ceremony . for the Rio Games — not that old, really, for today's elite swimmers. One of his top rivals, Ryan Lochte, is a year older and has every . intention of competing through the next Olympics. If . there is a comeback, Phelps wouldn't be doing it for the money, having . earned tens of millions of dollars in endorsements during his career. He . remains a marketable name, even in retirement, though his endorsement . potential certainly goes up if he's in the water. More . likely, this is another case of an athlete who simply missed the thrill . of competition and is still young enough to do something about it, . assuming he can find the motivation to endure Bowman's grueling regimen . for nearly three more years. 'There . are a lot of things that really excite me ... that get me motivated,' Phelps said. 'But I swam for 20 years. That's something that's going to . be very, very hard to top.'","After months of hints and half-denials, Michael Phelps has re-entered the drug testing pool for international competition .

A father who planned to turn a dilapidated Texas house into a home for his family was left devastated when the property was mistakenly demolished. Julio Soto arrived at the property in Dallas in August to find it had been demolished. It was torn down by city officials after they forgot to remove it from a list of eyesore homes to be flattened following its sale at auction. Mr Soto had only owned the property for three weeks and had just begun to improve its appearance. Scroll Down For Video . Julio Soto shows CBS reporter, Andrea Lucia, the empty lot where his house was demolished at 2007 Fordham Road . Dallas City Hall has been demolishing vacant homes in an effort to clean up the community . He told CBS that he had plans to fix up the dilapidated home--now just a plot of land-- and make it a nice place for he and his family to live. He told them, 'I need a bigger house because my kids are growing.' Soto originally bough the house at a city of Dallas auction. The city completely forgot they sold the house to Soto and they forgot to remove the home from a list of vacant homes to be torn down. Dallas city council member Dwane Carraway owned up to making a mistake and said that the city would reimburse Soto for his loss. Dallas city council member Dwane Carraway holds Soto partially responsible because he hadn't finished bringing the house up to code after purchasing it . The city plans to revisit their demolition process to make sure things don't happen again. He attributed the mishap to, 'a miscommunication between some departments in the city.' Dallas News reports that Assistant City Manager Charles Cato released a similar statement calling the mistake a 'miscommunication between the two city departments, real estate, and Code Compliance.' However, Carraway holds Soto partially responsible for not remodeling the home shortly after purchasing it. 'They have a responsibility to take that eyesore and bring it up to code, so the community doesn’t have to endure that,' said Carraway. Soto bought three homes prior to the one that was demolished, all of which were renovated and brought to code . Soto already began fixing the home that was demolished by buying new windows and cabinets . Soto is a contractor and said that he's helped to change many homes. 'That's what I've been doing all my life,' he said to CBS. According to Soto, he had been remodeling the house, but that it was in such poor condition when he bought it that the changes are taking time to complete. He already bought cabinets and windows for the new home. 'They left a lot of mess inside, so it take three weeks for me to clean it up.' This home is only one of the few homes Soto purchased from Dallas over the past few years. Soto plans to build a home from scratch on the empty lot at Fordham Road . Neighbors of Soto's other properties told CBS on Wednesday that those homes had improved greatly over time. Soto plans to keep his land on 2007 Fordham Road and build a home from scratch. This is not the first time Dallas demolished a house by accident.Two homes in the Dallas, Fort Worth area were mistakenly torn down over the summer, NBC reports. This caused the city to halt demolitions until they could improve the system. They attributed the flaws to 'human error.' City Spokesperson Bill Begly said, 'And what they're trying to do now is put in place more accountability, more documentation, more eyes on the whole process.' 'The whole idea is to take the human error element out of the process and ensure that something like this doesn't happen again,' Begley said.","Julio Soto bought a vacant home from a Dallas auction earlier in the summer and arrived at the property to find the home destroyed .

Hearing: Jimmy Savile's former flatmate Ray Teret covers his mouth with gloves outside Manchester Crown Court today . Jimmy Savile's former chauffeur appeared in court today charged with 15 counts of rape against young girls dating back to the 1960s. Ray Teret, 72, a former pirate radio DJ who once shared a flat with the shamed BBC star, is accused of a series of sex offences over almost 35 years. He appeared alongside two other men also charged with sexual offences and the hearing was told the trio are expected to deny all the allegations. Teret, dressed in a dark suit and overcoat with a purple scarf, was not asked to enter any pleas during the brief hearing at which he was told his trial would take place next year. He was first arrested in November last year on suspicion of a historic rape before being charged with a total of 32 sexual offences earlier this month. Teret shared a flat with Savile in Manchester in the 1960s, working as a DJ at stations including Radio Caroline under the nickname 'Ugly Ray'. Teret faces 15 counts of rape of girls aged under 16 and one of an adult, a girl who was 17 at the time. He was also charged with one count of attempted rape, nine counts of indecent assault - three of them against girls aged under 14 - and one count of gross indecency with a child under 13. Teret, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, also faces two counts of conspiracy to rape a girl under 16, one count of possession of extreme pornography, one count of possession of prohibited images and one count of possession of an indecent image of a child.

As relatives wept, the body of an Alabama woman whose wish was to be buried in her front yard was removed Friday, after her devoted husband lost a lengthy court fight to keep her there. James Davis, 74, said he promised his wife, Patsy, that he would bury her outside their two-story log home in the northeast part of the state. After her death in April 2009, the Stevenson City Council rejected his request for a cemetery permit for his yard, but he buried her a few feet from the front porch anyway.

Missed: Davis, holding his wife's picture, said there has been 'so much hurt' from the court battle . The city sued and he eventually lost his legal battle. A judge this week approved a plan to remove the body. One of Patsy Davis' daughters burst into tears as the vault containing her body was lifted out of the ground. James Davis watched silently from a few feet away. Family members, the sheriff and a deputy also looked on. Davis called the exhumation 'a travesty.' 'This never should have happened,' said Davis, 74. 'I broke no laws.' Neighbor Phyllis Matthews stood by and watched the vault containing the casket being raised. 'I'm . sorry for the family, what they're going through,' Matthews said. 'I . lost my mother back in April. I'd hate to think it was my mother they . were digging up. But she's buried in a cemetery.'

Preparations: James Davis (left, blue coat) and relatives gather to remember his wife Patsy before her body is exhumed from his front yard on Friday . James Davis, who had been married to his wife for 48 years, said he now plans to cremate her remains and keep them in the house. Davis told Jackson County . Circuit Judge Jenifer Holt during a hearing on Wednesday in Scottsboro, Alabama, that he would . comply with an order she issued last year. 'I'm gonna take Mama up and have her cremated and keep the remains in the house,' he said. He had previously vowed to never remove the remains of his wife after promising her before her death that he would bury her just yards from their front porch. He maintained the city shouldn't be . able to force him to remove the grave, which is marked with a headstone . and decorated with plants and flowers, from his longtime residence in . Stevenson. But he . conceded defeat earlier this week and said he would hire a contractor to . remove the body of his wife and then have it cremated. Devoted: James Davis, left, on Wednesday agreed to remove the body of his wife Patsy, right, which is buried in their front yard in Stevenson, Alabama. Respects: Daughter Rita Webb and sons Matthew and Nathaniel Webb observe Friday's exhumation . Davis said the exhumation and an urn would cost $2,745, and the judge also ordered him to pay $678 for a legal transcript the city said it needed. The couple both grew up in Dayton, Tennessee, and first met when she was seven and he was 11 and he asked her to accompany him to a strawberry festival. 'We went on that one date, and it was me and her the rest of the time,' he said. They were married for 48 years and had five children. In her later years, his wife suffered crippling arthritis, and Mr. Davis retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her until her death in 2009. The city sued to . make Davis remove the grave, arguing that laws prohibit people from . using their yards as burial grounds inside the city limits, and a judge . last year ordered Davis to move the remains to a licensed cemetery. The . Alabama Supreme Court recently refused to intervene in the case, and . Holt held the hearing to determine how the exhumation would occur and . how the costs would be covered. Remembered: In an image from August 2012, Davis stands in front of his wife's grave by their home . Memorial: He has been fighting to keep her body there - in accordance with her dying wishes - for 4 years . Outside court, Davis said he, his children and grandchildren were 'at ease' with the decision to remove the body and have it cremated. 'They can't hurt us anymore in this thing and there's been so much hurt, so much hurt,' he said. City attorney Parker Edmiston said the . town tried to work with Davis, offering him two plots in the town . cemetery for Patsy and himself, but the man refused to cooperate. 'He said it was easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, and that's what he did,' Edmiston said. Davis' attorney, Tim Pittman, and Edmiston agreed that the body, casket and . burial vault would be removed and the grave refilled immediately, but . Davis said he would not move the stone tombstone that has marked the . grave. Edmiston said a city ordinance prohibits markers like the tombstone at homes, 'but that's an issue for another day.' Davis said he had dropped a plan to declare his house a church so he could keep the grave as is. Loyal: James Davis watches on. This never should have happened,' said Davis, 74. 'I broke no laws.'

Five Royal Marines who were accused of killing an injured insurgent in Afghanistan have challenged a ruling that their names should be made public. The order was made after one of the men was convicted of murder over the death of the enemy fighter, while two more were cleared and the other two had all charges against them dropped. During the trial of three of the servicemen at a court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, an order was in place which prevented them being named. Challenge: Five servicemen investigated over the death of an Afghan insurgent are fighting a ruling that their names should be made public . Last Friday a court martial board . found a commando, known only as Marine A, guilty of murdering the man in . Helmand Province more than two years ago. Two . others, known as Marines B and C, were acquitted. Charges against a . further two Marines, referred to as D and E, had previously been . discontinued. Judge . Advocate General Jeff Blackett made a ruling that the names of the three . defendants and of Marines D and E should be identified publicly, but . they have now lodged a challenge against that decision. The . move was confirmed by the Judicial Office today and a hearing before . the Court Martial Appeal Court in London is expected to be held in the . last week of November. Sentence: Marine A, pictured, could face life in jail when he is sentenced on December 6 . Judge Blackett, when ruling that the . anonymity order should be lifted, said: 'The principle of open justice . is immutable and must only be restricted where either the administration . of justice would be seriously affected without the grant of an order . for anonymity or there would be a real and immediate risk to the . personnel were anonymity not granted. 'This . is not a case relating to the administration of justice and I am not . satisfied that those who seek a continuance of the anonymity order have . demonstrated that the fear that the marines' lives will be at risk is . objectively well-founded.' Counsel . for the marines said they wished to appeal and the judge said the . anonymity order would remain in force pending further determination by . the Court Martial Appeal Court. Marine A, 39, could face life in prison when he is sentenced on December 6. The head of the Armed Forces said this week that he should not be shown any clemency for his 'heinous crime'. General Sir Nick Houghton said: 'Murder is murder, . this is a heinous crime. No serviceman or woman is above the law.' Marine A killed . the insurgent near the end of a ‘tour from hell’, during which 23 . servicemen from 3 Commando Brigade were killed and the Taliban hung the . limbs of maimed British troops in trees as ‘trophies’. Not punishing him would severely 'erode the moral ascendancy over our enemies', General Houghton said. ‘It would be quite wrong for the armed forces to adopt some special pleading, some sort of exemption.' Lord . Guthrie, a former Chief of the Defence Staff, agreed and said: ‘The military . should observe the highest standards, and if some crime is committed, . like everybody else they should pay the price. Murder is murder.’ Harrowing: Video from a Marine's helmet camera was shown at the court martial, which captured the moment Marine A murdered the Taliban soldier in this field . Marine A was found guilty by a court . martial of shooting the injured insurgent in the chest at close range . with a 9mm pistol, then taunting him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, you . c***.’ He was convicted after a two-and-a-half week trial of slaying the insurgent on September 15, 2011. His . badly injured victim was found with an AK-47 assault rifle and grenade . following an attack on a British base. Marine A denied murder, claiming he . thought the insurgent was already dead. He is the first serviceman to be convicted of murder on active . service abroad since the Second World War. Footage: The recording hears the group dragging the man's injured body with the marines apparently joking about refusing to give first aid . His closest friends and family maintain that his killing was out of character. A family friend told the Mail: ‘We know him and the shooting was not him, it wasn’t in character. He is keeping positive.’ Relatives of troops who died as they served alongside Marine A in 42 . Commando criticised the military authorities for prosecuting him. One . bereaved father said the decision was ‘inappropriate’. Others said the . unique psychological pressures of war should be taken into account. Retired . Colonel Mike Dewar said it was important to ‘make exceptions for . soldiers in extraordinary circumstances’. He added: ‘This is a . completely different environment to a cold-blooded murder in normal . circumstances.’ Some . senior retired commanders, including Major General Julian Thompson, who . led the elite commandos in the Falklands War, have called for leniency . when Marine A is sentenced.","Marine A, 39, executed a Taliban fighter after Apache helicopter attack .

Trudeau, who lives in Oak Brook, a Chicago suburb, looked on calmly as a government attorney accused him of lying repeatedly in his infomercials, which were ubiquitous on late-night television.

The ship’s Captain portrayed by Tom Hanks in a forthcoming Hollywood movie is at the centre of a $50million lawsuit – brought by the very men whose lives he is credited with saving. According to legal papers seen by MailOnline, the true story of the Maersk Alabama – the US cargo vessel captured by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden four years ago – is not a simple narrative of Captain Richard Phillips’s personal sacrifice in the face of extreme danger. Instead it is a story of corporate greed and hubris, in which Phillips captained his ship against more than seven maritime warnings and his own men's pleas, sailing deep into waters notorious for pirate attack. Scroll down for video . Heroism or hubris? Tom Hanks with Captain Richard Phillips whom he portrays in a film based on the captain's ordeal at the hand of Somali pirates. Hostage to fortune: A still from 'Captain Phillips,' shows Tom Hanks as the lead of the title, but was it bad luck or bad judgement that put the Maersk and her crew in peril? Speaking to MailOnline, attorney Deborah Waters, who first brought the 11 men’s claims in 2009, said: ‘He put them in harm’s way and they suffered as a result and were hurt as a result. ‘It is galling for them to see Captain Phillips being set up as a hero. It is just horrendous and they’re angry.’ The Maersk Alabama came under pirate attack on 8 April 2009. For the 20 strong crew and their Captain that was the first of a five day ordeal. Captain Phillips offered himself as a hostage in return for his crew’s safety. Ten hours into the hijack, with the Maersk under pirate control, crew members managed to take a prisoner of their own with sheer 'brute force.' By luck they taken the pirates' leader. Speaking shortly after the attack Second Engineer, Richard Matthews recalled: ‘Right then and there we had a chip. They came on with a plan and now their plan was disrupted.’ Hero's welcome: A weary Captain Phillips is met by his children at Vermont airport on 17 April 2009. His ordeal ended five days earlier, when US Navy SEAL snipers shot three of his pirate captors dead . Safe harbour: A team tow the Maersk Alabama lifeboat on which Captain Phillips was held captive to assault vessel USS Boxer on 12 April 2009 . It meant that Captain Phillips was able to offer the pirates an exit strategy– a hostage swap and a lifeboat for a clean get away. But the agreement was not honoured by the pirates. Instead, after securing the return of their leader they took off with Captain Phillips as hostage. The drama unfolded on news networks across America and beyond. The Maersk Alabama was the first US vessel to be taken in these waters and now its Captain’s life hung in the balance. President Barrack Obama meets Captain Phillips and wife Andrea in the Oval Office in May 2009. The President praised Phillips's heroism as an example to all . His story of survival, of attempted escape, beatings and ultimately liberation by US Navy SEAL snipers was compelling and inspiring. President Barack Obama went as far as to commend the Captain and issue the statement: ‘I share the country’s admiration for the bravery of Captain Phillips and his selfless concern for his crew.’ He added: ‘His courage is a model for all Americans.’ In the days that followed Captain Phillips's dramatic rescue, this quiet family man from Vermont, married to a nurse, Andrea, was much feted. The Making of a Hero: Tom Hanks poses with 'real life hero' Captain Phillips on the cover of Parade magazine. The 58-year-old father of two, originally from Boston, was praised as the epitome of an ordinary hero: a veritable Everyman who had heroism thrust upon him by circumstance. And he had shown great courage. He had stepped up to the mark and placed himself between the pirates and his crew. He had shown an instinct to protect and survive. The immediate aftermath was filled with jubilation and relief at Phillips's and his crew’s safe return. They made the arduous trip home from Mombasa, Kenya on 12 April. And, once there, the decisions that had put them in such danger in the first place passed with little mention, publicly at least. But that chain of cause and effect was always bound to be scrutinised. WIthin months of the ship's return lawsuits were in motion. The suits are not being brought against Captain Phillips personally. Instead they are being brought against the ship-owners, Maersk Line Limited and the crew’s employers Waterman Steamship Corporation. But the ‘hurt and anger’ described by Mrs Waters, and experienced by her clients is personal. Speaking on behalf of her clients, Mrs Waters said: ‘The crew had begged Captain Phillips not to go so close to the Somali coast. 'He told them he wouldn’t let pirates scare him or force him to sail away from the coast.’ In the two days before the Maersk Alabama was taken, two other vessels had come under pirate attack in the Gulf of Aden prompting official Maritime safety groups to issue warnings. 'The crew begged him not to go so close to the Somali coast...He told them he wouldn't let pirates scare him.' Attorney Deborah Waters . Key among those advisory notices was, according to the lawsuits, one issued ‘on or about April 6, 2009.’ Then, Maritime authorities issued a warning to ‘sail at least 600(nautical) miles off the coast of Somalia because pirates were in the region and taking hostage ships and their crews.’ ‘In spite of the notices and warnings,’ the suit continues, the decision was made ‘to sail Maersk Alabama within approximately 250 (nautical) miles off the coast of Somalia. Easy target: The Maersk Alabama was well beyond the distance from the Somalian coast designated 'safe' by Maritime authorities when pirates struck . Three members of the special US Navy escort that ensured the Maersk Alabama's safe passage to Kenya stand aboard the beleaguered vessel . The Maersk Alabama arrives in Kenya on 11 April 2009. Captain Phillips returned one day later. In the foreground the hundreds of the world's media wait and watch the end of the enthralling drama . Navy records place the Maersk Alabama just 240 nautical miles off the coast when it came under attack. It was, according to Mrs Waters, ‘A purely financial, business decision,’ to take such a hazardous course in the face of increased pirate activities in those waters and repeated warnings. The Maersk Alabama was heading to Mombasa, Kenya, carrying 17,000 tons of cargo – much of it aid destined for Kenya, Somalia and Uganda. Sailing the safe distance from the coast would add a day to the trip and use extra fuel and manpower. A bridge too far: A still from 'Captain Phillips' recreates the terrifying moment Somali pirates took control of the Maersk Alabama . Troubled waters: An image taken two months BEFORE the Maersk Alabama was seized shows Somali pirates surrendering to a US Navy patrol in the Gulf of Aden at a time when pirate activity was known to be on the rise . Mrs Waters said: ‘Captain Phillips made that trip all the time. His decision was signed off by Maersk absolutely. There’s a constant communication between the bridge and the outside world. The company knew precisely what was going on and Captain Phillips was absolutely aware of the warnings.’ As for Maersk and Waterman, the suits allege both, ‘knowingly, intentionally and wilfully sent their employees into an area where pirates were attaching merchant vessels…exposing their employees to grave danger.’ It has taken the 11, four years of fighting to secure trial dates. The same amount of time it took Captain Phillips to secure a book deal and see that book turned into a movie. Mrs Waters said: ‘They fought and fought but we finally got everyone to agree on the jurisdiction of this suit. At one point we were lodging papers in Virginia, Alabama and Texas.’ Now MailOnline has learned the cases are set to be heard in Mobile, Alabama in December. . In the prelude to his eponymous movie ‘Captain Phillips’ has said: ‘Most heroes don’t have a choice. They just do the best they can.’ But Mrs Waters is quite clear that there was a choice made. The choice was to carry on into dangerous waters.  According to the lawsuit it was a decision made purely to save money. And it was a decision that very nearly cost the crew of the Maersk Alabama - and her captain - their lives.","Two pirate attacks and more than 7 warnings went ignored as Phillips captained the Maersk Alabama deep into the danger zone .

In her stylish black-and-white outfit, Emilia d’Erlanger cut a striking figure at last month’s Royal christening. Of Prince George’s seven godparents she is, perhaps, the least well known: an unfamiliar face among even seasoned royal watchers. Though a close confidante of both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for many years, the elegant interior designer rarely flaunts her intimate friendship with the young Royals, and is happy to remain discreetly in the background. Head girls: Kate has learned that a hat often adds a jaunty air to more formal outfits. She and good friend Emilia D'Erlanger have opted for flying saucer shapes, worn at an angle, for wedding attire. It shows of their long hair . Yet since William and Kate married, Emilia’s influence and advice has become invaluable to them, making her one of their most trusted and respected companions – so much so that she is known as ‘Kate’s secret stylist’ among the Duchess’s circle. Emilia, 31, who has known Kate since she was 13, has overseen all Kate’s public outfits of late. She chose the Alexander McQueen suit that Kate, also 31, wore to the christening, and slowly but surely is now moving the Duchess into new fashion territory. Emilia is cajoling Kate to embrace patterned and colourful fabrics while encouraging her away from the bland neutral palates that she naturally favours. Emilia herself admires vintage style and is keen to see Kate experiment with quirkier outfits. Pretty in prints: Emilia (pictured here in 2007) has been encouraging Kate to wear prints (pictured right in 2008) According to their friends, Emilia – who uses her maiden name despite being married to banking heir David Jardine-Paterson – regularly passes on fashion tips to the style-conscious Duchess and points her in the direction of up-and-coming fashion houses and designers. ‘Emilia is cool and trendy and she has a great eye,’ says one friend. ‘Kate has always loved her style and she trusts her advice.’ And it isn’t only Kate’s fashion sense that her loyal friend is redesigning. Emilia is also helping the Royal  couple design the interior of their home at Kensington Palace. Dressing her age: Kate (pictured in September 2012) been criticised for dressing too old. Emilia (pictured in July 2012) has been encouraging her friend from Marlborough School to choose simple but flattering dresses . William and Kate moved into Apartment 1A in early October after a year of renovations. According to friends, Emilia is a frequent visitor and has spent hours going through glossy interior design magazines and ‘look books’ with Kate. Such is the couple’s faith in her taste that she has also been asked to help acquire furnishings for Anmer Hall, their home on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, which is currently undergoing a refurbishment. It is clear that Emilia is a significant figure in the Royal inner circle and her influence has grown over many years. Fitting the occassion: Figure-hugging dresses suit naturally slim Emilia and Kate, nipping at the waist and sitting elegantly on the knee. Emilia is pictured at Kate's wedding in 2011, Kate at a Remembrance event in 2012 . In fact, it is down to Emilia that William and Kate are together, as she introduced them when they were fresh-faced 17-year-olds. When the Duchess of Cambridge was pictured with unflattering streaks of grey last week, it was a marked contrast with her normally immaculate look. It was also a clue to the trendy new colouring technique that attracted attention at Prince George’s christening. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that she has been having a £350 colouring treatment known as balayage – a technique that involves ‘painting’ the hair with ammonia-free dye to give a natural look. It is popular with celebrities including Kate Moss and Sienna Miller. But, as last week’s pictures make clear, balayage colour can fade quickly on brunettes – and Kate has already summoned her hairdresser for a touch-up. While it has long been believed that they met at St Andrews in 2001, when both were first-year undergraduates, friends say Emilia engineered their first meeting in the summer of 1999. She and Kate were already long-standing school friends at Marlborough and Emilia was part of the ‘Glosse Posse’ who would socialise with William and Harry at Highgrove. Some believe it was that meeting that prompted Kate to turn down her place at Edinburgh University (where Emilia studied) and re-apply to St Andrews where she enrolled on the same History of Art course and lived in the same halls of residence as William. Though she has been discreet, Emilia has always been a key player in William and Kate’s elite social set. Having maintained close friendships with them both during those formative university years when their romance blossomed, it was Emilia who advised Kate on how to cope during the break in their courtship back in April 2007. She whisked Kate off to Ibiza for a . week of sun and fun to help mend her broken heart – and to show William . what he was missing. However, Emilia’s friendship with William far predates her role as Kate’s confidante and adviser. Black and white: Geometric patterns and monochrome are now both firm favourites for the two English roses . She was a childhood friend of William and Harry, and during her Marlborough days, Emilia went on a cruise of the Greek islands with the Princes and Prince Charles. She was so close to the young William, who was at Eton at the time, that it was reported that they were dating. Those close to Emilia say she and William were never romantically involved and sources close to the Duchess say Kate trusts her oldest school friend implicitly.","Marlborough College friend urges Kate to dress her age and wear colours .

A handyman who won a $32 million jackpot lottery with his barber is being sued by his sister who says she is entitled to a third of the winnings. Leila Nahas claims she paid her brother Samir Haddad $1 toward the $3 winning ticket and deserves $10.6 million, plus $500,000 in damages. But Haddad said he doesn't owe her a dime, because 'they never had an agreement'. Lottery winner Samir Haddad is being sued by his sister Leila Nahas who claims she deserves one-third of the $32 million jackpot winnings because she contributed $1 to the $3 ticket in 2008 . Jumping for joy: Samir Haddad with his wife showing off the thousands of lottery tickets he bought over 30 years before his luck turned . Sun News Network reported Haddad and his longtime friend and barber Mike Dettorre hit the jackpot with a Lotto 6/49 ticket in June 2008 in Canada. Dettorre had cut Haddad's hair for more than 30 years at the barber's Old Ottawa South shop. Haddad, a self-employed floor installer and handyman, reckons he's bought 'thousands' of lottery tickets over the years. The men split the winnings, and 35 of Haddad's family - including his sister - traveled to the Ontario Lottery and Gaming office in Toronto in a limousine to collect the money. He split some of his winnings with his family and sister. But now Nahas claims Haddad visited her store before the June 2008 Lotto draw to buy a ticket. She said they'd agreed to split one and that she’d contribute to another ticket he planned to buy with Dettorre. Sheer luck: Samir Haddad collected his winnings at Ontario Lottery and Gaming Prize Center, pictured, with 35 of his family members, including his sister who is now suing him . Nahas alleges he showed her an old ticket with numbers he’d played with the barber, she wrote them on a slip of paper and they settled up. According to her statement of claim filed in January 2010, Nahas trusted her brother would tell her if he’d won with the shared ticket, but two months later, the paper fell from her wallet as she shopped and she 'realized that she was owed one-third of the proceeds from the winning ticket.' She claims her brother admitted it was the ticket he’d bought with her, but said it was unfair for her to share the winnings because she’d only contributed $1 and he’d bought thousands of tickets for years, according to Ottawa Citizen. However Haddad vigorously denies all of his sister's allegations, including that he told her she was 'dead to him'. He said he went to the barber shop on the day of the draw, got the old ticket then went to the store around the corner to buy a new one with the same numbers. He put it on Dettorre’s mirror and learned from him two days later that they’d won. The siblings haven't spoken in several years. Dettorre is reportedly not part of the legal fight, but he could lose some of his winnings if the court upholds Nahas' claim. The bitter battle will land in front of a judge and jury on Tuesday.","Lottery winner Samir Haddad is being sued by his sister Leila Nahas .

He has been convicted of raping and physically abusing two women . A security guard has been convicted of raping and physically abusing two girlfriends. One of his victims said that James Keaney, 36, went from 'nicey-nicey to monster'. The High Court in Glasgow heard that the brutality began in each case when the women became pregnant. One of the women aged 37, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was raped when she returned home from hospital with her baby. Keaney, of Castlemilk, Glasgow, dragged the terrified woman across the kitchen floor and had sex with her against her will. As he raped her Keaney said: 'That's what you get for having a child to someone else.' This woman told prosecutor Paul Kearney that the abuse began early in her pregnancy and was like 'A blot out of the blue.' She said: 'The first time was a slap which made my face swell up.' After that she said that she was abused almost daily and regularly raped by Keaney. Keaney, who was controlling, watched her when she went shopping and would interrogate her about anyone she spoke to. If he didn't believe what she was telling him he would drag her about the house by the arm and hair. Sick Keaney would also tie her up with belts and fling her in a hall cupboard. His second victim aged 32, also suffered the same fate when she became pregnant. Keaney would prevent her seeing her family. He would take the house keys with him and also put the baby's pram in his car. He also listen in to her phone calls and she told the court: 'If I saw a boy I knew from school I wouldn't even look at him because of the accusations and interrogations that would follow.' High court: The court heard that the two women did not know each other and both did not go to the police . Prosecutor Mr Kearney told the court: 'This was a clear course of conduct on his part characterised by intimidation and physical and sexual abuse in private behind locked doors.' The court heard that the two women did not know each other and both did not go to the police. They were both contacted during a police investigation. Mr Kearney added: 'These women were strangers to each other yet gave similar accounts of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of the accused. 'Their only link was to have a relationship with a man who systematically lowered their self worth, belittled and assaulted them, controlled them, dominated them, assaulted them and raped them.' Keaney was convicted of raping and physically abusing the two women. The offences were committed between 1996 and 2005 at addresses in Glasgow. In evidence Keaney claimed both women were liars and had made up the allegations to get at him. When asked by defence QC Garry Allan if his manner went - as one of his victims claimed - from 'nicey-nicey to monster' he replied: 'No, I don't conduct myself in that manner at all.' Keaney was given bail by judge Norman Ritchie QC and will be sentenced next month.","James Keaney, 36, went from 'nicey-nicey to monster', victim said .

'He's got housing now, but they're willing to help him with that. They will help him rectify this situation to get the records right so he can get his Medicaid, he can get his benefits and we can fix this.' Honest: Hackensack Main Street, where a homeless James Brady found an envelope containing $850 and turned it into police . Brady's battle with bureaucracy began in October when a public servant read about his 'cash windfall'. Brady made headlines last month for handing in to police $850 he found in an envelope on a sidewalk on April 16, even though he was homeless and unemployed. He turned in the cash because 'he didn't want to take money . from anyone who could be worse off' than himself. Police gave him back the money because no-one claimed it. He . received praise from well-wishers and a commendation from the City . Council, and moved into an apartment with a county housing voucher that . paid for all but $5 of his $1,095 rent. But Human Services director Agatha Toomey . wasn't impressed. Last month, she called Brady in for a meeting, armed with a print-out of a news story about Brady's good deed and . subsequent windfall. Toomey asked Brady how he had spent the $850. He told her he had bought napkins, toilet paper, a bathmat and a sandwich. Of benefit: Brady receives $210 per month as well as medical benefits, both of which have been halted . He . then received a letter informing him that his $210 per month and his . Medicaid had been cut off from 18 October until 31 December. 'I’m . sorry but we had to - I had to - follow regulations,' Toomey told the Record. 'He only pays $5 [a month] in rent.' Brady was appalled. 'This is stupid,' Brady said. 'I . had already proven my honesty by turning in the $850. They were . treating me like I was a dishonest individual, like I was trying to . cheat them out of the money.' Shocked by the news, people from across . the U.S. rallied to support Brady through social media, letters and . donations that have totaled more than $6000. 'I’m amazed. One of the things is: I didn’t ask for any of this. I was just putting myself out there because I wanted to help homeless in Hackensack,' he said. 'To see it get picked up by so many papers and the response — it’s tremendous. People are very sympathetic.' Authorities said James Brady's payments would be restored . Toomey did not appear at last night's council meeting. But her friend Stefani Pedone told the meeting that Toomey didn't deserve to be bad-mouthed. 'It's a wonderful thing that we have people that are honest in this world and do the right thing,' Pedone said. 'However, what has been going on in the newspaper, on the internet on the blogs against a woman who has devoted 38 years of her life to the City of Hackensack, there is nobody more compassionate than Mrs Toomey. 'So if she went by the books, and according to the books, she did the right thing. The city should not be chastising someone like Mrs Toomey.' Brady's descent into homelessness began after the September 11 terrorist attacks in Manhattan. He had worked as a news photographer before becoming a market data analyst. He . lost his job due to a merger and was looking for work in 2001. He had . been due to attend a finance and technology exposition at the World . Trade Center on September 11 but canceled. Brady . was left traumatized by the knowledge he could have been killed in the . attacks and sank into depression, using up his savings and retirement . fund until he was evicted from him apartment and became homeless.","James Brady, 59, was homeless when he found found $850 and gave it to police .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 07:30 EST, 11 November 2011 . A 'savage' U.S. Army sergeant who shot dead three unarmed Afghan civilians for sport has been convicted of murder and jailed for life. Army Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs was the highest ranking of five soldiers charged over the deaths of the unarmed men during patrols in Kandahar province early last year. At his court martial, the 26-year-old acknowledged cutting fingers off corpses and yanking out a victim's tooth to keep as war trophies 'like keeping the antlers off a deer you'd shoot'. On trial: Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs, accused of killing three unarmed Afghan civilians, walks through a field on his way into a village in Kandahar province . Prosecutors said Gibbs and his co-defendants knew the victims posed no danger but dropped weapons by their bodies to make them appear to have been combatants. The sergeant was convicted of murder, conspiracy and other charges in one of the most gruesome cases to emerge from the Afghan war. The military jury sentenced Army Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs to life in prison, but he will be eligible for parole in less than nine years. Gibbs had insisted he wasn't involved in the first or third killings, and in the second he merely returned fire. Three co-defendants pleaded guilty, and two of them testified against Gibbs, portraying him as an imposing, bloodthirsty leader who in one instance played with a victim's corpse and moved the mouth like a puppet. Gibbs's lawyer insisted they conspired to blame him for what they had done and told the five jurors the case represented 'the ultimate betrayal of an infantryman'. In court: A court artist captures Gibbs, seated lower left, as his lawyer Phil . Stackhouse stands at centre, and military Judge Lieutenant Colonel Kwasi . Hawks listens, at top left, during the case . Sketch: Gibbs is shown in this courtroom drawing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, during his court-martial for charges of killing three Afghan civilians . The jury deliberated for about four hours before convicting him on all charges. The sentencing hearing began immediately after the verdict was announced, with prosecutor Major Andre LeBlanc asking for the maximum, life without parole. He told jurors that Gibbs was supposed to protect the Afghan people but instead caused many to lose trust in Americans. Mr LeBlanc noted that Gibbs repeatedly called the Afghans 'savages'. 'Ladies and gentlemen, there is the savage - Staff Sergeant Gibbs is the savage,' he said. Gibbs's lawyer, Phil Stackhouse, asked for leniency - life with parole - and noted that Gibbs could be eligible for parole after 10 years if they allowed it. 'He'd like you to know he has had failures in his life and he's had a lot of time to think about them,' Mr Stackhouse said. 'He wants you to know he's not the same person he was in Afghanistan. 'He doesn't want his wife to have to raise their son on her own.' The investigation into the 5th Stryker Brigade unit exposed widespread misconduct - a platoon that was 'out of control', in the words of prosecutor Major Robert Stelle. Brutal slayings: Dead Afghans are tied to a post in one of the many images published from the 'Kill Team' Sentenced: Corporal Jeremy Morlock is pictured on a mission holding a gun . The wrongdoing included hash-smoking, the collection of illicit weapons, the mutilation and photography of Afghan remains and the gang-beating of a soldier who reported the drug use. In all, 12 soldiers were charged. All but two have been convicted. The probe also raised questions about the brigade's permissive leadership culture and the Army's mechanisms for reporting misconduct. After the first killing, one soldier, Specialist Adam Winfield, alerted his parents and told them more killings were planned, but his father's call to a sergeant at Lewis-McChord relaying the warning went unheeded. Winfield later pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the last killing, saying he took part because he believed Gibbs would kill him if he did not. The case against Gibbs relied heavily on testimony from former Specialist Jeremy Morlock, who is serving 24 years after admitting his involvement in all three killings. According to Morlock, Gibbs gave him an 'off-the-books' grenade that Morlock and Private Andrew Holmes used in the first killing - an Afghan teenager in a field - in January 2010. Inside: A military courtroom at Joint Base Lewis-McChord sits empty . during a recess in the court-martial of Gibbs, convicted of killing three . Afghan civilians . The next month, Morlock said, Gibbs killed the second victim with Specialist Michael Wagnon and tossed an AK-47 at the man's feet to make him appear to have been an enemy fighter. Morlock and Winfield said that during the third killing, in May, Gibbs threw a grenade at the victim as he ordered them to shoot. Morlock and others told investigators that soon after Gibbs joined the unit in 2010, he began talking about how easy it would be to kill civilians, and discussed scenarios where they might carry out such murders. Asked why soldiers might have agreed to go along with it, Morlock testified that the brigade had trained for deployment to Iraq before having their orders shifted at the last minute to Afghanistan. The infantrymen wanted action, he testified, but instead found themselves carrying out a more humanitarian counter-insurgency strategy that involved meetings and handshaking. Charged: Adam Winfield, left, has already . been jailed for three years for involuntary manslaughter and Andrew . Holmes, right, pleaded guilty to a single murder count . Another soldier, Staff Sergeant Robert Stevens, who at the time was a close friend of Gibbs, told investigators that in March 2010, he and others followed orders from Gibbs to fire on two unarmed farmers in a field; no one was injured. Gibbs claimed one was carrying a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, but that was obviously false, Stevens said. Stevens also testified that Gibbs bragged to him about the second killing, admitting he planted an AK-47 on the victim's body because he suspected the man of involvement with the Taliban, according to a report. But during the trial, Gibbs insisted he came under fire. 'I was engaged by an enemy combatant. Luckily his weapon appeared to malfunction and I didn't die.' Gibbs testified that he wasn't proud about having removed fingers from the bodies of the victims, but said he tried to disassociate the corpses from the humans they had been as a means of coming to terms with the things soldiers are asked to do in battle. He testified that he did it because other soldiers wanted the trophies, and he agreed in part because he did not want his subordinates to think he was weak. Gibbs initially faced 16 charges, but one was dropped during the trial.","Sergeant Calvin Gibbs cut fingers off corpses and yanked out victim's tooth as war trophies .

But convicted drug dealer Terry Bennett has been told to pay for his crime by writing a 5,000-word essay. The 32-year-old had been given a suspended prison sentence as well as 240 hours of community service for possessing a kilogram of cannabis with intent to supply. However, after Judge Julian Lambert heard that a recurring shoulder injury put paid to any physical work, he took the unusual step of ordering Bennett to write a 5,000-word essay on the negative effects of cannabis. Convicted drug dealer Terry Bennett, left, was told to write an essay on drugs by Judge Julian Lambert, right . If he fails to submit it by his . deadline at the beginning of next month, the suspended sentence could be . activated and he would be sent to jail. Bennett, a father of two who . has no previous convictions, was told to write the essay on the ‘dangers . of drugs’ at Bristol Crown Court. The former plumber said yesterday: ‘I . asked the judge if I could write a balanced argument for and against . cannabis, but he said that since it’s illegal I should only write about . the bad things. 'I’m just going to do my best to write about certain . dangers caused by cannabis that people might not know.’ Bennett, who claims jobseeker’s . allowance, was originally sentenced in October last year after a police . raid on his home in December 2011 uncovered 996g of cannabis and £2,685 . in cash. He then missed two court-ordered work . placements at the British Heart Foundation in Kingswood, Bristol. He had . been given the job of moving heavy furniture, but could not carry out . the work because of the injury. Bennett claims the illegality of cannabis is more detrimental to users than the harmful effects of the drug . Bennett has been . carrying out research and plans to structure his thesis around the . mental health consequences of smoking cannabis. He added: ‘I’ve got a . drugs conviction, so for me to subsequently take on a more serious role . in society it is imperative that I prove to everyone that I’m clean and . steering clear of cannabis, purely because it is illegal.’ Bennett, who lives with his mother in . the village of Cold Ashton, near Bristol, admitted the charges but was . unable to do the unpaid work because of a shoulder injury he suffered . during a snowboarding holiday six years ago. As well as the essay, which has to be . handed in to his probation office, Judge Lambert gave Bennett a . four-month curfew order between 8pm until 6am and is currently wearing . an electronic tag. He also voluntarily provides samples . to be tested for drugs, so social services will allow him access to his . sons, who live with their mothers. Bennett said: ‘Hopefully the essay . should be quite good, but it’s been ages since I last wrote an essay. I . have already done a bit of research. I’ve always loved writing.’ Bennett has drawn up five bullet points outlining his theory upon which he will base his dissertation:1 - Cannabis changes your mentality, and cause psychotic episodes.2 - The stigma of being associated with cannabis can damage your social standing.3 . - It's illegal and the money generated is not taxable, meaning it costs . the Government rather than being a potential source of revenue.4 - People are 'ripped off' as unscrupulous dealers up their profit by mixing the drugs with sand and glass.5 - When consumed in certain ways, most notably being smoked with tobacco, cannabis can cause cancer, especially mouth cancers.","Terry Bennett, 32, of Cold Ashton, Glos, admitted intent to supply cannabis .

Councillors in a seaside resort are hoping to ban naked events over fears the charity fundraisers are scaring away families. Clacton-on-Sea in Essex has been the venue for a sponsored skinny-dip and a nude bike ride in the past few weeks, with many locals saying the fun events livened up the area. But the leader of the district council is now stepping in and attempting to block any further naked get-togethers in order to protect the town's 'image'. Protest: Dozens of cyclists took to the town's roads to demonstrate against the dangers of riding bikes . Last month, more than 100 people stripped off and went for an early-morning dip in the sea on a Clacton beach to raise money for Marie Curie Cancer Care. And on Saturday, around 35 naked cyclists took to the town's roads in protest against the dangers faced by bike riders - and the organiser plans to hold the event again next year. Peter Halliday, Conservative leader of Tendring District Council, railed against the nude events and vowed to stop them happening again. 'Clacton is a traditional family seaside resort and in my opinion people riding around on bikes with no clothes on does nothing to enhance our image - in fact it harms it,' he said. Leave your clothes behind: The swimmers were raising money for Marie Curie Cancer Care . Good-natured: But local councillors have criticised the events because they are not family-friendly . 'They did not apply to use land under our responsibility so there was little we could do other than work with other agencies on a bit of a damage-limitation exercise. 'However, I now want to get together with the police and others round the table and come up with a plan to put a halt to naked events in our area before it all goes too far.' Linda McWilliams, the councillor responsible for health and safety, added: 'I will certainly be bringing this matter up with the police and will suggest that we investigate what we can do in the future to prevent a repeat of what we have witnessed this summer.' The council singled out the cycle ride as being more damaging than the swim, as it took place in the town centre during the middle of the day. But Robert Brown, the organiser of the bike protest, insisted he was making an important argument and pledged to attract up to 100 cyclists to next year's event. Good fun: The nude events are said to have gone down well with most locals despite the controversy . Intrusive? Officials are worried the nudity has driven away tourists from the town's beaches . 'The event was to protest against car culture and the idea of riding naked is to highlight the vulnerability of cyclists,' he said. 'Being naked in public isn't an offence in itself. 'Similar events are held in towns and cities around the world and across the UK in places like Brighton, Portsmouth and London. 'The London event attracts thousands of people and benefits shops and traders in the area.' The 47-year-old, who is also hoping to break the world record for the largest ever naked fun run, continued: 'There were more people in favour of our event than against it. We got a huge cheer as we rode down the High Street.' An Essex Police spokesman said: 'There has been a precedent from similar events held in Brighton and London in the past and it was deemed that there were no legal grounds to prevent it going ahead.'","Clacton-on-Sea hosts charity skinny-dip and nude bike ride through town .

Hopes were dashed Tuesday when a decades old Florida quadruple murder investigation ended when authorities concluded there was no link between their case and the killings dramatized in the book In Cold Blood. The convicted killers, Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, were long suspected in the slayings of Cliff Walker, his wife, Christine, and their two children. The family was killed in December of 1959, about a month after Smith and Hickock murdered a Kansas farmer and his family. Investigators were unable to make a DNA match between Smith and Hickock, and Christine Walker, who was raped and had semen on her underwear. Cold case? Cliff and Christine Walker were murdered in their Florida home along with their children in a crime long connected to In Cold Blood murderers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock . Two families? Richard Hickock, left, and Perry Smith, right, fled to Florida after murdering a family in Kansas and some believe they killed again . Authorities said they were unable to match the DNA because only partial profiles could be taken from the exhumed bodies in December, and the Walker crime scene samples were old and degraded. No more tests were scheduled. ‘The complication lies in the fact that there's still some uncertainty,’ Bell said. ‘It wouldn't exclude them but it also does not provide us with any level of confidence to say there's a match because there's not.’ Police still believe the two men were likely involved. ‘We're not closing the case,’ Bell said. ‘It remains an unsolved murder. The mystery continues and we'll look for other opportunities. We've reached a point where we don't believe we're going to accomplish that through DNA testing.’ Testing decades-old DNA can be difficult, said Dr. Michael Baird, the laboratory director of the DNA Diagnostics Center in Ohio. Red herring? Smith and Hickock's remains were exhumed om 2012 and their DNA taken.

Cleared? Smith and Hickock were cleared of the crime after their capture in 1960 for the Kansas murders of the Clutter family, but experts have since called the lie detector results of the day useless . Truman Capote befriended the killers to write his groundbreaking, novel-like book about the Kansas murders . The murders in Holcomb, Kan., were chronicled in Truman Capote's book, which gripped readers with its vivid narrative of the Clutter family life and the tormented inner workings of the killers' minds. The book detailed the murders, the trial and the killers' execution. The two men — who were drifters — were eventually captured in Las Vegas. A polygraph test cleared them of the Walker murders. But in 1987, a polygraph expert said those tests in the early 1960s were worthless. In 2007, Sarasota Det. Kimberly McGath took a fresh look at the Walker murders and wanted to test the killers' DNA. Smith and Hickock killed the Clutter . family on Nov. 15, 1959, and took off to Florida in a stolen car. They . were spotted at least a dozen times from Tallahassee to Miami and points . in between. On Dec. 19, . the two men checked out of a Miami Beach motel. The Walker family was . killed that day at their home on a ranch in the small community of . Osprey about four hours northwest of Miami. Cliff . Walker was shot to death and his wife was beaten, raped and shot. Three-year-old Jimmie was shot to death and his 2-year-old sister was . shot and drowned in a bathtub. News stories at the time noted that there . were gifts around the tree. In Cold Blood: Smith and Hickock killed the Clutter family, pictured, in their own Holcomb, Kansas home in 1959 . Siblings: Nancy Clutter, 16 (left), and her 15-year-old brother Kenyon Clutter were killed with their parents in Kansas in 1959, a quadruple homicide documented in Truman Capote's In Cold Blood but never connected to the Wilson murders in Osprey, Florida . Connected? The caskets containing the bodies of the Clutter family are loaded into hearses. Many hoped their murders could be connected to the Walkers' in Florida, but those hopes have been dashed . At some point on the same day, Smith and Hickock bought items at a Sarasota department store. On Dec. 21, witnesses say they spoke with Smith and Hickock in Tallahassee. McGath said the Walkers had been considering buying a 1956 Chevy Bel Air, which was the kind of car Smith and Hickock had stolen and were driving through Florida. McGath thinks that somehow, the Walkers and the killers met because of the car. The detective found witness statements — and talked to people who are still alive — who said they saw Smith and Hickock in the Sarasota area around the time of the Walker murders. In Cold Blood mentions the Walker killings in a short passage; Capote incorrectly states that the slayings occurred near Tallahassee, Fla., about five hours north of the actual scene. He also relates a conversation between Hickock and Smith on a beach in Miami, and has Smith speculating that ‘a lunatic’ copied the Kansas killings. The book says that in reply, Hickock ‘shrugged and grinned and trotted down to the ocean's edge.’","Christine and Cliff Walker were killed along with their two children in their Osprey, Florida home .

A walrus trainer, likened to rapper Kayne West for being 'outspoken', has promised to fight a Canadian theme park which has served him with a $1.5million lawsuit claiming he tried to steal one of the park's beloved animals. Philip Demers today said he would fight his corner after being accused of the audacious plot to sneak in and take the hefty tusked animal from his former employers at Marineland Canada. The lawsuit filed on Tuesday accuses the 'walrus whisperer' of becoming bitter after his idea for a reality TV show which placed him at center stage and likened him to West, was turned down by the attraction. Close bond: Philip Demers is facing a lawsuit from his previous employers at theme park Marineland Canada. They claim he plotted to kidnap Smooshi the Walrus, pictured with him . Torn apart: Philip Demers left Marineland last year claiming he disagreed with the conditions for animals. The lawsuit claims Demers is bitter because the park refused to let him become a reality star . It claims that he was plotting to take female walrus, Smooshi, who was weighed at 365kg five years ago. Since her 2004 arrival at the Niagara Falls park which boasts of rollercoaster rides amid beluga whales, killer whales and dolphin shows she followed Demers around and allowed him to pet her. She was so enchanted with her trainer she quickly made the loved-up pair the park's star attraction. The lawsuit claims the theft of Smooshi was agreed between Demers and others on October 7 last year. It states they planned to 'unlawfully gain . entry into Marineland at a time known only to them...in . order to steal Smooshi the Walrus.' Demers has denied the claims and counter-alleges that Marineland are trying to shift focus from his allegations that they don't care for their animals properly. The trainer, whose relationship with Smooshi won him fame and numerous TV appearances, resigned his post in August after 12 years at the park. Outspoken: Marineland, left, has taken out a $1.5million lawsuit against Philip Demers described as the 'Kanye West of Walrus training'. He is outspoken like the rap star, right . The 34-year-old, who appeared on the likes of Jimmy Kimmel Live, has since blogged about the park claiming it is a 'house of horrors' with 'negligent use of chlorine' in the animal's water. He is also calling for a change in animal protection laws throughout the country. 'The notion that I’m . ‘plotting’ to steal Smooshi is absurd,' he told the Canada Star today. 'I also doubt my second . floor apartment would hold a walrus.' Walruses are found in coastal waters in the arctic areas of Canada, Alaska, Siberia and Greenland . Adult males can grow up to 12 feet long and can weigh more than 1,500kg . Females like Smooshi can grow up to 3 meters and weigh up to 1,200kg . The tusked, whiskered creatures dig in the sand for food but also tend to eat seals . Smooshi arrived at Marineland in 2004 from Russia at 18 months old . 'I look forward to defending myself,' he added. He also told ABC News of his sadness at being apart from Smooshi, who he bonded with or 'imprinted on' when he helped care for her at the animal park when she arrived from Russia aged only 18 months. 'Smooshi [the walrus] and I share an . anomaly of a relationship which continues to inspire me, and I do dream . of a day when we can be reunited,' he told the broadcaster. 'Her well being was . historically dependent on my being a part of her life, and it saddens . me that she can't see me anymore. I miss her and all the animals a great . deal.' Marineland deny the claims made by Demers. In a statement on their website from owner and Marineland President, John Holer, they say animal safety is of their utmost concern. 'Marineland staff members and I . consider each Marineland animal resident a member of the family. I will . spare no expense when it comes to the health and well-being of animals . in my care,' it states. In November 2012 an inspection of the . park by Canada's Accredited Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) reportedly . revealed no problems with the conditions. The park's lawsuit was filed at St Catharine's courthouse in Ontario, Canada. It includes charges of trespassing and intimidation, alleging that Demers unlawfully entered Marineland property and intimidated its employees. In happier times Demers told the Canada Star of his love of Smooshi. 'She is completely subordinate. I can grab her head and wrestle with her . and sit on her back. With any other walrus, you'd be in big trouble,' he said. 'She's the cutest thing on the planet.' 'If I leave, I'll take her with me,' he then joked.","A $1.5million lawsuit filed on Tuesday reportedly accuses Philip Demers of plotting to steal Smooshi the walrus from the wildlife attraction Marineland Canada .

BDanny Cohen has unveiled a range of measures after admitting bloated management structures at the BBC can 'stifle creativity' It probably seemed like a good idea at the time going 'back to the floor' to reconnect with rank and file BBC staff. But the reality of working as a 'runner' on a frantic Saturday night live show maybe quite a lot trickier than £300,000-a-year director Danny Cohen imagined. The BBC’s Director of Television has announced that he will start work as the most junior of assistants on Strictly Come Dancing this autumn in a bid to address the corporation's overly 'hierarchical structures.' He will also send his fellow senior managers to take up in junior roles on other shows to gain direct experience of the production process. Cohen's decision to run errands on the Saturday night entertainment show, which has just begun its eleventh series is part of a wider shake-up in BBC culture designed to 'give more status and seniority' to creative people and revitalise the often criticised bloated ranks of management. Despite his illustrious career with the corporation Mr Cohen admitted that he had never before held the unglamourous role of 'runner' which in many cases amounts to that of a general dogsboddy. Nevertheless the former BBC3 chief said he was excited at the prospect of trying out the role for the first time. He said: 'I didn’t do running because I started in documentary programmes and so I started as a junior researcher, I'm really looking forward to it.' Mr Cohen has also voiced concerns that the BBC's existing structure can 'stifle creativity' as those who involved in production are perceived as less valued than the organisation’s managers. And his initiatives to re-address the balance could not come any sooner as the BBC faces a crisis over its senior management structure and salaries. Just last week the payoffs awarded to departing executives became the subject of sharp criticism by the National Audit Office and the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. Speaking to the Independent, Mr Cohen said he wanted his highly paid managers to have a 'closer understanding' of how things actually work in production. He said: 'I think we senior managers should have a closer understanding of what it’s like on the ground in production, at the coal face, making the programmes and I’m going to encourage all my senior team to be runners and do similar things in the next few weeks. Re-connect: Mr Cohen believes his plan to work as a runner on the popular show is the best way for senior staff to identify with those working 'at the coal face' 'Up until now in the BBC to get status and seniority you have had to become a manager and I want to break that philosophy and give more status and seniority to the most creative people without burdening them with everything which goes with management which can be distracting and is not the best use of their time. 'It’s a way of giving higher profile to creativity and ideas development and benefiting people who don’t want to become managers but are crucial to the future of the BBC because they are some of our strongest creative. That’s quite a big change in philosophy for us really.' The plans follow in a similar vein to one of the corporation's own TV shows 'Back to the Floor', in which business figures including Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold and former Millwall chairman Theo Paphitis, are filmed returning to junior roles in their own companies. Mr Cohen also announced that he wants to assemble a team of half a dozen senior creative figures to re-energise certain parts of the organisation. Strictly: The cast of the eleventh series of the dance programme which is on the BBC this autumn, Cohen says he is looking forward to getting a chance to work on the show . But critics point out that the BBC already has a Creative Director in Alan Yentob, who is paid £183,500, plus a second salary for presenting the landmark arts strand Imagine. The new roles will be called 'Creative Labels' and will be based in a new unit called 'Development Central.' They will be tasked with bringing new creative energy to under-performing areas across BBC networks and the Director says he hopes the roles will help encourage individuals from outside the BBC to join the organisation. Oxford graduate Mr Cohen, 38, was appointed director of television in April with a salary package worth £327,800. Previously he spent three years in charge of BBC Three before moving to BBC One, where he has commissioned popular shows including Call The Midwife and The Voice. He has repeatedly voiced his concerns that the broadcaster has become over-reliant on middle-class  viewers and is at risk of losing touch with the rest of society. And it seems this insistence on re-connecting will remain a common thread in his approach to his new leadership role. Danny Cohen with wife and author Noreena Hertz, Oxford educated Mr Cohen was appointed director of television in April this year with a salary package of £327,800 . Reflecting the much criticised management structures of the corporation he admitted that 'current structures can stifle the energy and creativity of individuals.' He added: 'We have been too siloed before and have risked having too hierarchical structures and the changes I have been trying to make are about releasing creative energy from those siloes and hierarchies.' In a further effort to shake up the big wigs an encourage those further down the corporate ladder to contribute, BBC staff who come up with ideas for programme formats will now see their names on the credits at the end of those programmes. In the past senior executives and producers have claimed credit for shows on behalf of their more junior staff. Mr Cohen said: 'Everyone who develops an idea will get a credit, we haven’t had a consistent pattern of development credits and we are going to introduce development credits to ensure that that crucial stage in the development of a programme is properly recognised.' Cohen’s initiative, though admirable, could have been timed better coming as it does alongside an announcement by director of news and current affairs, James Harding, that the BBC was to axe 75 posts in its news division. In a cheerless memo to staff, he said the job losses would 'add to uncertainty after what has been a trying year.' He said: 'I also appreciate the concern the cost savings come at a time that so many people are working hard to make the most of new technologies and striving to deliver the best journalism in the world. 'The reality is that we have to live within the terms of the licence fee settlement.'","£300,000-a-year director Danny Cohen, 38, wants senior managers to challenge the corporation's overly 'hierarchical structures'

America’s wealthiest business owners are self-made and the younger they are, the more generous to charity they tend to be. According to two separate recent surveys, a clear majority of America’s most successful business owners are self-made, and younger ones tend to be more socially conscious. Across all age groups, a majority also say they started those businesses to have more control over their futures. The younger high-net worth entrepreneurs are, the more quickly they pile up wealth, according to a separate survey – likely a cause for Millennials more freely donating to various charities and causes than their older counterparts. Living the American Dream: Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the wealthiest of all millennials, and he is the most charitable . A US Trust survey of 711 people with at least $3million in investible assets that found that 78 per cent founded or co-founded the businesses the made them wealthy also found that 70 per cent acquired the bulk of their wealth through that business. The American Dream isn’t dead yet. ‘Business ownership is alive and well in the U.S. economy, and new innovation is fueling entrepreneurship that knows no age limits,’ Keith Banks, president of U.S. Trust, told Fox Business. With 60 per cent telling US Trust they . feel more able to create significant wealth by going into business . themselves, it’s no surprise that 60 per cent say they did so  to have . more control over their futures. Generous: Mr Zuckerberg (c) is pictured with NJ Gov. Chris Christie (l) and Newark, NJ Mayor Cory Booker (r) announcing a $100million donation to Newark Schools - two years before Facebook's IPO . Additionally, US Trust found that 79 per cent of Generation Y (Millenial) entrepreneurs claimed their prosperity better enabled them to positively contribute to society. Little more than half of Generation X business owners answered similarly. Given the sizeable generosity the likes of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, this should come as little surprise to many. A separate survey, conducted by Fidelity, found that both Generation X and Y millionaires give significantly more, and are more outwardly socially conscious than their baby boomer parents. While Gen X and Y millionaires give $54,000 a year to charity, baby boomers donate a measly $12,000, according to Fidelity. Also, 82 per cent of younger high-net-worth individuals volunteer or serve on the board of a charity, only 49 per cent of baby boomer millionaires can make that claim, Fidelity said. ‘Gen X/Y millionaires are taking a dramatically different approach to their wealth than the older generations, signaling a new era of wealthy investors,"" said Bob Oros, executive vice president of Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services.’ Billionaire in a day: Facebook's IPO made founder and CEO Mr Zuckerberg (front center) an overnight billionaire . Topping the list of new money generosity is Mr Zuckerberg, who gave almost $500million to charity last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Facebook founder famously donated $100million to the Newark, NJ city school district in 2010. Mr Zuckerberg, along with other tech entrepreneurs are also reportedly planning to launch an as-yet-unnamed education and immigration advocacy think-tank, according to multiple reports.","Millionaire Generation X and Y entrepreneurs make more money more quickly than baby boomer millionaires .

Before her passing at age 61 last month, Miriam Aguirre Santos restated and put down in writing her final wish - to have her eyes given to her son. When he was 5 years old, the Cuban-born Juan Aguirre was struck by a drunken driver while walking on the island where his family owned a house. The crash damaged the cornea in his left eye, leaving his vision permanently blurry. But all that changed earlier this month. Dying wish: Miriam Aguirre Santos (left) died from a heart attack at age 61, but not before making sure that doctors will use her eyes to restore the eyesight of her 39-year-old son, Juan (right) Within days of his mother's death from a heart attack, Mr Aguirre, 39, underwent the first ever mother-son corneal transplant surgery in the history of the Florida Lions Eye Bank. ‘It’s like a whole new world has opened up,’ the 39-year old Aguirre told the Miami Herald. ‘I’m seeing things like I never did before. Everything is very, very colorful.’ Juan's childhood accident that left his cornea severely scarred did not stop him from becoming a successful musician performing under the stage name Diablo Dimes. In 2011, Aguirre moved his wife and two children from Miami - where their extended family settled after immigrating to the U.S. in 1980 - to a town in rural Virginia. His mother, who had been widowed for two decades, stayed behind despite Juan's efforts to relocate her closer to his new home in the Shenandoah Valley. On the day of his mother's 61st birthday September 30, Juan Aguirre got a call that she suffered a fatal heart attack. Tragic accident: When Juan Aguirre was 5 years old, he was struck by a car, leaving him with damaged cornea in his left eye. However, that didn't stop him from becoming a singer performing under the name Diablo Dimes . Miriam Aguirre Santos was an organ donor, and before her passing she reiterated that she wanted doctors to use her eyes to restore her son's damaged vision. The 61-year-old woman's corneas turned out to be healthy, and since the organs can only be preserved for a week, doctors rushed to perform the operation. Elizabeth Fout-Caraze, the executive director of the Florida Lions Eye Bank, warned the Aguirre family that the chances of the transplant being successful were slim to none because of the numerous variables involved in the procedure. Hoping for a miracle, the doctors and Mr Aguirre decided to go through with the surgery. On October 1, Amescua cut a hole about 8mm in diameter from Juan Aguirre's left eye, then grafted the eye with matching slice of cornea from his mother's eye. Historic surgery: In Florida Lions Eye Bank's first mother-son transplant, doctors cut a piece of Juan Aguirre's cornea (not pictured) and grafted the eye with a piece of his mother's cornea . Against all odds, the transplant took and Aguirre returned home to Virginia the next day. Doctors predict that the singer-songwriter will be seeing better than ever before within nine months to a year. Although it took some time for the Aguirre clan to come on board with the transplant idea, given that organ donation is not viewed favorably in the Hispanic community, the relatives eventually accepted Miriam’s final wish. Besides her eyes, which she had donated to help her son, Aguirre Santos saved the lives of two other people who received her liver and kidneys. Lifesaver: Besides helping her son, Miss Aguirre Santos gave two other people a new lease on life by donating her liver and kidneys . As for Juan Aguirre, he said that every time he looks at himself in the mirror now, he sees his mother's eyes staring back at him.

Energy giant ScottishPower will pay £8.5million compensation to customers after an investigation by the industry regulator found they had mis-sold gas and electricity. Households were given misleading estimates of how much they would pay for energy if they switched their supplier, Ofgem found. ScottishPower will now write to 336,000 households that may have been the victim of mis-selling - and up to 50,000 of those could be in line for payouts of up to £60. Additionally, 140,000 of the company's most vulnerable customers will automatically receive £50 each in December, under the deal hammered out by the regulator. Compensation: ScottishPower persuaded people to switch suppliers by providing misleading estimates of how much they would pay for their energy, an investigation found . Ofgem launched an investigation after claims that the energy giant, who supply power to 5.6million households across Britain, provided misleading information to customers on the doorstep and over the telephone when persuading them to switch. Ofgem said that the mis-selling happened between October 2009 and January 2012. In separate developments today, MPs said they would haul bosses from the Big Six firms before a committee of MPs to give evidence about recent price hikes. SSE, British Gas and npower have all announced tariff rises in recent weeks. ScottishPower today apologised 'unreservedly' to those affected and said it had taken steps to address its failures. Under the deal agreed with regulators, the company has set up a £1million compensation fund for those affected - along with £7.5million for the most vulnerable. The automatic £50 payouts will be given to those on the government-led warm home discount scheme. Mis-selling: The company will write to 336,000 customers who could have been affected . ScottishPower . said that, of the households affected by mis-selling, around 50,000 . potentially lost out financially and could be due compensation. It . estimates compensation payments will vary from between £5 and £30 for . each gas and electricity service provided to households. Customers . who think they were the victims of mis-selling will have to provide . details of their previous supplier and Scottish Power will calculate . whether they are eligible for compensation. Ofgem said that, despite the sales . practice failures, it found no evidence that the company deliberately . set out to mis-sell to customers. The group stopped doorstep selling in June 2011 and has overhauled training and monitoring procedures for all telesales staff. Caroline Flint, Labour’s Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said: 'This is yet more evidence that Britain’s energy market is broken. 'Scottish Power is the third energy company to have been caught out misleading the public and two more are still under investigation. 'Yet again Ofgem’s response has been weak and David Cameron refuses to stand up to the energy giants. 'These companies need to know that if they mistreat their customers there will be a heavy price to pay.' Energy and Climate Change Secretary Edward Davey said the compensation payout was evidence that energy companies were beind held to account. He said: 'This is a clear, strong signal that energy companies shouldn't expect to get away with bad practice. 'We're giving Ofgem powers that force energy companies to make direct payments to consumers hurt by these kinds of activities, and backing up Ofgem's reforms so that consumers get a simpler, fairer deal.' Neil Clitheroe, ScottishPower's chief executive of energy retail and generation, said: 'We accept Ofgem's findings and we apologise unreservedly to those customers affected. 'This arose as a result of new regulations which were introduced in 2009. I am sorry to say that we didn't implement these properly at that time.' The probe into ScottishPower comes as part of a wider market inquiry into mis-selling across the energy industry, which has already seen three investigations concluded. SSE was fined £10.5million in April for 'prolonged and extensive' sales practice failures. Sales overhaul: ScottishPower apologised 'unreservedly' to those affected and said it had taken steps to address its failures . Ofgem is still conducting two ongoing mis-selling investigations into npower, which was launched in 2010, and into E.ON, which was launched last year. Ofgem said it decided not to levy a . fine against ScottishPower as the £8.5 million customer payment package . agreed by the firm would be 'of greater benefit to energy customers than . if a substantial penalty was imposed'. It added that breaches of its rules on energy firm sales activities were vital to protect consumers. Ofgem . warned: 'Consumers can suffer financial detriment if they do not . benefit from savings that they are led to expect - they may switch to a . more expensive deal and competition suffers as consumers lose faith with . the market and the value of switching energy supplier.' Sarah . Harrison, Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement, said: 'Ofgem . welcomes ScottishPower's recognition of its failure to comply with the . energy sales rules which are there to protect the consumer.

A woman who was sent to jail for benefit fraud was reported missing by her family because she did not tell them she faced prison. Denise Dyson was so confident she would avoid jail despite wrongly claiming £22,000 from the taxpayer that she failed to tell anyone she was due in court. So when she was sentenced to nine months in prison and taken straight from the courtroom to the cells, her family called the police and filed a missing person report. 'Missing': Denise Dyson's family reported her missing after she went to prison without telling them . Officers had to tell the worried relatives that Dyson, 60, was in fact in jail after being convicted of defrauding the State. Dyson, from Wigan, used her maiden name to claim benefits, despite having married husband Terry in 2011. Between 2006 and 2011, she received £22,000 more than she was owed in income support and council tax benefit by pretending she lived alone. She was jailed for nine months in May, and was released after serving two months in prison. But now Dyson has appeared at Manchester Crown Court again for a proceeds of crime hearing, during which she was ordered to pay back £25,856 within six months. She was previously convicted in 2010 for working while receiving benefits, unlawfully claiming more than £9,000, and received a 12-month community order. Jailed: Dyson received a nine-month sentence for benefit fraud at Manchester Crown Court, pictured . The court heard that Dyson is now estranged from her husband Terence, who is also subject to a court order forcing him to pay back £24,000 which he stole from his employer.

A seven-year-old boy with learning difficulties has been threatened with deportation despite the fact his mother has British citizenship. The Home Office has written to Jamie Leung, who is Canadian by birth, warning him he could be 'forcibly removed' from the UK. He has lived in Crossens, Southport, with his mother Sara, since June last year. Jamie Leung (left) has been warned he could be 'forcibly removed' from the UK. He has lived in Southport with his mother Sara (right) since June last year . His mother, who has dual British and Canadian citizenship, said she did not think she would need a visa for Jamie for her home country just because he is Canadian by birth. She has now said she is 'horrified, angry and upset' at the actions of the Home Office after they sent a letter warning Jamie he could be deported. Ms Leung moved to Germany in 2007 where she met her partner Heiko Dietz when Jamie was a toddler. Upon arriving in the UK from Geramny in 2012, Ms Leung was told her son could not enter the UK legally. Jamie was issued with a six-month visitor visa and Ms Leung was told to resolve the issue with the Home Office. But she said she could not afford about £1,000 for a special visa for her son. Upon arriving in the UK from Geramny in 2012, Ms Leung was told her son could not enter the UK legally . Acting on advice Ms Leung and her German-born fiancé Mr Dietz decided he should apply for a residency card and then have Jamie registered as his dependent. But she said the Home Office rejected the application and her young son could now be forcibly removed from the country. In its letter the Home Office said it did not receive the correct evidence to support the application. It goes on to say: 'As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the United Kingdom you should now make arrangements to leave. Ms Leung's other children, Quinn (right) and Elisha (centre) are not affected by the ruling. The children are pictured with Ms Leung and her partner Heiko Khelifi . 'If you fail to do so voluntarily your departure may be enforced.' Ms Leung's other children, Quinn, three, and Elisha, 11 months, are not affected by the ruling. Ms Leung said: 'They have Jamie’s birth certificate and passport. I have two other European-born children here, I can’t just pick up and leave, it is ridiculous. 'I have been told that Jamie should have a visa, this had just never occurred to me. 'No one ever asked me any questions about his passport when we went to other European countries. 'Then to come to one of my home countries, I would never have considered it.' The letter from the Home Office landed at the family’s home on Ms Leung's birthday on Saturday. She said she is yet to explain to Jamie what is happening. 'I have not attempted to tell him. I am worried about his mental state, I do not want to upset him. What mother would want to explain to their child that their government wants them out?' Ms Leung said it was 'particularly stressful' making the application while pregnant with her third child. She said: 'During the time of all of this, trying to communication with the UK Border Agency, I was also heavily pregnant with my daughter, so it was particularly stressful.' Ms Leung said they were due to appeal the Home Office's decision. The family’s plea to keep Jamie in the UK has been backed by Southport MP Dr John Pugh. He said: 'You would have thought that the immigration department had better things to do than harass a seven-year-old child. 'This is one of those situations which the rules and regulations clearly do not properly cater for. 'They wouldn’t even know which country to send him to. So it is farcical to carry on like this. 'There is no court in the land that is going to split up a mother from her child. The whole thing is ludicrous bureaucracy.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the EU rules. 'The onus is on the individual to provide the necessary evidence to support their application.'","Jamie Leung, 7, has been warned he could 'forcibly removed' from the UK .

Teacher Paul Daw pleaded guilty to using a mobile phone to look up teenagers' skirts and film them from behind . A teacher at a girls’ school has pleaded guilty to using a mobile phone to look up teenagers' skirts and film them from behind. Paul Andrew Daw, 48, appeared at Wirral magistrates court accused of five charges of outraging public decency, and one of making an indecent image of a child. Daw, an English teacher for more than 20 years, had been working at University Academy Birkenhead, the court was told. One of the charges he faced was recording 'female pupils from behind, their backsides and chest area' on December 18, 2012. Four other charges related to filming up the skirt of girls and young women in Liverpool city centre on March 23, and December 9, 18 and 21. Prosecutor Amanda Cullen told the court Daw had been caught after a woman complained to a community support officer at a mobile police station on Church Street in Liverpool. The woman said she had seen a man 'following her daughter around the shops and filming her'. The prosecutor said the officer quickly found Daw, of Bebington, Wirral, and took him back to the mobile station and when asked if he had recorded any indecent images Daw had replied 'they could be construed as offensive' and 'they might be indecent to some'. When his phone was examined 41 video clips of teenage girls were discovered and Miss Cullen said Daw had been videoing at shops in Liverpool, Birkenhead and Ellesmere Port. Miss Cullen said there were also 'numerous clips inside the school, films of female pupils' and the headteacher had confirmed the pupils were from the Academy. Miss Cullen said: 'The principal said at no time did Mr Daw ask for permission to film - and if he had it would have been refused.' She said when asked why he did it the defendant said he had been suffering from depression and was 'physically sick every morning before going to work'.

A coroner has warned of the dangers of so-called 'legal highs' after a teenager died from taking a drug he ordered online marked 'not for human consumption'. Adam Hunt, 18, died on August 18 this year after taking the psychoactive substance AMT at his home in Southampton, Hampshire, after purchasing it from a website. An inquest heard how the keen football fan had told a friend he planned to take the drug, which he believed had the same effects as ecstasy, but died four days later. Adam Hunt, 18, died in hospital four days after taking the drug AMT after ordering it online . He told . his friend that he had bought two grams of the substance, as well as . etizolam, though there was no trace of the second drug in his system. Adam's mother, Bernadette Fagan, returned home from work to hear her son calling for help from his bedroom. 'He was sweating and shaking. She . immediately phoned for help and ambulance staff arrived a short while . later and took Adam to hospital,' the inquest was told. The teenager died four days later at Southampton General Hospital after being put in a medically-induced coma. The inquest heard police discovered Adam had researched AMT and legal highs on the internet after his computer was seized. Packets containing the drugs were also found, with each bearing a 'not for human consumption' warning. Pathologist Dr Brian Green said a post mortem found he had died of multiple organ failure . caused by taking almost 1g of the drug, Alpha Methyltryptamine. He said: 'One of the problems of . buying medicines from unregulated manufacturers is the individual . awareness of the concentration of the substance in the drug provided may . bear no resemblance to the actual concentration, that puts an even . greater risk in the ingestion of substances that are unregulated.' Detective Sergeant Jeremy Boughay, of Hampshire police, said that Adam had been looking forward to watching an England football match with his father on the day. He said: 'Adam Hunt was an 18-year-old male who enjoyed a normal, happy life living with his mother. He was a happy person with lots of friends, he enjoyed normal activities including computer gaming and football.' Coroner . Keith Wiseman ruled his death had been accidentally caused by . experimenting with the drug, before warning: 'Anyone taking this kind of . drug in any kind of quantity is potentially walking into the unknown, . into disaster really.' Speaking . to the boy's family he added: 'It was sadly an experimentation gone . wrong. I would like to express my very sincere condolences to everyone.' The teenager died in hospital in Southampton four days after being put in a medically-induced coma by doctors . Mr Wiseman also advised parents to raise the issue with their children, especially if they were behaving unusually. Though the drugs AMT and etizolam are not prohibited under the misuse of drugs act, they are not safe to use, according to Mr Boughay. He explained the difficulty of legislating against such substances as a slight change in their composition could lead to them falling into a different class of drug that would isn't prohibited. Speaking after the inquest, he said: 'Our concern is that people have the perception that because they are marketed with the term legal high that they are safe. 'The point we are trying to make is that there is no process to ensure what is written on the packet is what is in there because they are unregulated. 'People consider them to be safe because they are not illegal but in fact they can be more of a danger than other substances on the market.' AMT, which has similar effects to amphetamines, was developed to tackle depression but was later ruled out as a suitable medication because of its hallucinogenic properties. Ms Fagan and Adam's father, Darren, released a statement through police paying tribute to their son at the time of his death. Adam, who 'loved football and was a Saints season ticket-holder' was described as a 'very normal young man'. 'He did well at school and just two years ago he left with 11 GCSE A-C passes and had gone on to study electrical engineering at college in an attempt to follow in his dad’s footsteps,' his parents said. 'He was very thoughtful and caring and loved his family and friends dearly. One of the things we will always remember though about him was his fantastic sense of humour. It is very hard to think we will not get to laugh or talk with him any more. 'His life had such potential and was all in front of him. Sadly it has been cut prematurely very short.' 'Legal highs' like mephedrone, pictured, are often marketed as plant food or bath salts . 'Legal highs' are substances which produce a similar effect to drugs like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy, but are not controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act. These new substances are not yet controlled because there is not enough research to base a decision on. More and more 'legal highs' are being researched to see the dangers they pose, and if they should be made illegal. The drugs cannot be sold for human consumption and so they are often marketed as bath salts or plant food to get around the law. While not considered illegal, that does not mean 'legal highs' are safe. You cannot be sure what is in the substance, or what effect it might have on your body. 'Legal highs' including Ivory Wave, Mephedrone and 5-IT have been directly linked to emergency hosptial admissions, and in some cases deaths. 'Legal highs' fall into one of three categories: . Taking 'legal highs' carries a great risk and can be very unpredictable. The chemicals they contain in many cases have not been used in drugs for human consumption before and so have not been tested to show they are safe. The risk can be augmented if the substances are taken with alcohol, in extreme cases the mixture can result in death. It is likely that drugs marketed as 'legal highs' may contain substances that are actually illegal to possess.","Adam Hunt, 18, died after taking one gram of drug Alpha Methyltryptamine .

Julian Ovenden, who plays Charles Blake on Downton Abbey, said his Eton education leaves him being saddled with 'posh boy' parts . His cut-glass accent may be the key to winning the heart of heiress Lady Mary. But in real life, Downton Abbey’s latest heart-throb says being an upper-class actor is a hindrance. Julian Ovenden, who plays Charles Blake in the ITV drama said he was always saddled with ‘posh boy’ roles because of his elite Eton education. He added that he had to travel to the US to win roles that were not variations of Jane Austen’s romantic lead Mr Darcy. Ovenden, 36, was three years above Prince William and actor Eddie Redmayne, both 31, at £11,090 a term Eton College. Other leading actors to emerge from the school include Dominic West, 44, and Homeland star Damian Lewis, 42. Speaking at the London Festival of Cabaret, Ovenden said: ‘I don’t know if Eton has been a leap pad. 'I think you have to be aware of the situation we live in a class-conscious country. ‘I don’t assume that I am going to be cast as a Glaswegian landlord. ‘My powers of transformation don’t stretch that far so I am much more likely to be asked to play a “posh boy”. ‘But the school has produced some . fabulous actors.

The actor, who plays the part of Lady Mary Crawley's most recent love interest in the ITV drama, admitted travelling to the US in pursuit of more diverse roles . He said: ‘If you go to a school like that, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have money or certain views. Homeland actor Damian Lewis also attended the £11,020 a term Eton College . ‘It’s . very short-sighted to judge people like that, and if it was the other . way round and we were judging people who’d gone to comprehensive school, . you wouldn’t get away with being so generalised. 'I can vouch for . the fact that, if you go to a school like that, there’s no room for . snobbishness though there might have been once upon a time. ‘It . doesn’t really exist anymore - the nepotism school tie - I’m sure it . does exist in places but in acting you do have to earn your stripes.’ In last Sunday’s episode of Downton Abbey, Mr Ovenden and widow Lady Mary - played by Michelle Dockery - appeared to be on the cusp of a new romance. In one scene, they splashed though mud together while feeding pigs at night. In a separate interview with the Mail, the father-of-two revealed he is equally romantic in his personal life: ‘I’d say I am a very passionate person. 'When I passed my motorcycle test about six or seven years ago, my wife Kate was working in Provence doing an opera. ‘I said “I’m going to come and see you”. ‘I . did the 800 mile trip in about 12 hours - all in one go.

Before Harry and his friends arrived in Vegas, they spent a week on Necker, the private island of Sir Richard Branson, whose son Sam was celebrating his 27th birthday.

The swimmer will be going for a hat-trick of London 2012 golds when she competes in the final later. But it appeared that the athletes were more interested in posing for photos with the prince than watching what was going on in the pool. Earlier in the day, the Prince cheered on the GB women's goalball team as they smashed their way to a 5-0 win against Denmark - securing themselves a place in the quarter-finals.

Harry was obviously intrigued by the relatively new sport that was only . introduced to the Paralympic Games in Arnhem in 1980. He spent some time ahead of the start of the match examining and listening to the ball the players use. As . the game unfolded Harry, today dressed in a white, red and blue Great .

When the match ended, Harry rose to give Britain's women a standing ovation. The team will have to wait for the remaining matches in Group C and D today before finding out who they will face in tomorrow’s last eight matches. On form: Prince Harry appeared to be in good humour as he chatted to fellow spectators at the goalball match . Victorious: Prince Harry watched the GB women's goalball team storm to a 5-0 win against Denmark . While at the Aquatics Centre, the prince also met Paralympic athlete and British military hero Derek Derenalagi. Derenalagi lost both legs and was pronounced dead after his vehicle hit an improvised device in Afghanistan in 2007. But medics then found a pulse, and Derenalagi made a remarkable recovery. He competed in the discus event at London 2012, finishing 11th. The pair laughed and joked as Harry praised his journey to the 2012 Paralympic Games. Derenalagi said: 'He (Harry) asked me about my performance last Friday and I told him that I was very proud to have competed for ParalympicsGB but a little disappointed in my performance. 'He said that he thought it was a remarkable achievement to have gone from the frontline to representing GB again at the Games, and that I have a lot to offer ParalympicsGB.' Prince Harry's Paralympic outing demonstrates the Royal is keen to put his holiday scandal behind him. The Royal Family was left reeling . last month after photographs of the prince frolicking with an unnamed . blonde in his Las Vegas hotel during a sordid game of 'strip billiards' were published on the Internet and in one British newspaper.

Both Harry and Derek are wearing the Adidas Front Line to Start Line t-shirt, which are being sold to raise money to help injured servicemen and women such as Derek to get back into competitive sport . St James's Palace have appealed to British newspapers not to run the pictures, arguing that Harry has a reasonable expectation of privacy since he was on a private holiday. Only The Sun chose to run them arguing that the photographs - which were taken by fellow revellers with the knowledge of his police protection officers and then sold to a US celebrity gossip website - were an issue of press freedom and in the public interest. Their decision has prompted 3,600 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission but the palace has not made a decision over whether to take legal action yet.","Prince Harry makes first appearance at Paralympic Games to watch GB's women's goalball team storm to victory against Denmark .

Defence chiefs spent £28 million of taxpayers' cash last year on an army of private lawyers to fight legal claims against the military. The rise of human rights legislation and the number of cases being brought means cash which should pay for weapons and equipment is going to lawyers. Defence Minister Anna Soubry revealed the amount spent on external lawyers in the Treasury Solicitors Department, barristers and private legal work. Defence Minister Anna Soubry, left, revealed the MoD spent at least £28 million fighting legal claims last year . But the MoD admits real spending on lawyers is likely to be much higher because the figures does not include the cost of legal work commissioned separately by the Army, Royal Navy and RAF, the Service Prosecuting Authority or for legal advice in foreign countries. Troops have suffered a pay freeze, recruiting has been cut and thousands of personnel have been sacked as commanders try to fill a £28billion budget black hole. Defence sources there is a growing number of compensation claims submitted by injured troops and foreign nationals claiming they are victims of abuse and torture. As well as using private lawyers, the MoD employs 190 lawyers, more than at any time in its history. One senior officer last night said: ‘Spending on lawyers is the only growth area in the Armed Forces.’ Last year the military was inundated with more than 5,827 legal suits. Since 2005, more than 36,500 compensations claims were brought by members of the Armed Forces and their families. Many have been for compensation for battle wounds sustained in Iraq and Afghanistan. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are having to spend taxpayers’ money defending the department and our military personnel.'","There has been a rise in cases put down partly to human rights legislation .

Movie rental firm Blockbuster  collapsed into administration yesterday, putting more than 4,000 jobs  at risk as the crisis on the High Street deepened. The UK arm of the American entertainment firm, which has 528 stores in Britain, joined music group HMV and photography specialist Jessops on the list of failed retailers. In a desperate seven days for the High Street, the total number of jobs facing the axe reached more than 10,000. Also yesterday, Orange and T-Mobile operator EE announced plans to close 78 stores. And fashion brand Gio-Goi, popular with celebrities, has appointed KPMG as administrator. Scroll down for Blockbuster UK's first television advert from 1989. Blockbuster in Glasgow: Already today stores across the country began clearance sales. On some, To Let signs had already been put up . Blockbuster has lurched from crisis to crisis as habits have changed, with people increasingly opting to download movies over the internet rather than visit its shops. It finally bowed to the inevitable yesterday, appointing accountant Deloitte, which is also acting as administrator to HMV, to try to find a buyer. All stores will remain open for the time being and, unlike HMV, Blockbuster will continue to honour vouchers and credit notes. Deloitte partner Lee Manning believes Blockbuster has a future, but with fewer stores. Britain’s battered High Street has been hit hard by spiralling rent costs and other bills. Cash-strapped consumers have reined in spending on all but the most essential of items as sweeping austerity measures take their toll. Electrical chain Comet pulled down the shutters just before Christmas, and Aquascutum, Clinton Cards and JJB Sports all ran into trouble last year. Blockbuster in Hertfordshire: The firm, which first opened in 1989, has appointed Deloitte to seek a buyer for all or parts of the business just days after rival HMV hit the rocks . In London: It is the latest firm to see its business slip away to online retailers, such as Netflix and Amazon¿s LoveFilm, which allow customers to have films, games and music posted to their home or live-streamed online . In Manchester: Blockbuster UK, which first opened in 1989, has appointed Deloitte to seek a buyer for all or parts of the business just days after rival HMV hit the rocks . In Newcastle: Blockbuster UK's demise comes amid dire warnings for Britain's retailers this year. More stores are expected to go bust following a Christmas that saw families tightening their belts and spending less money on the High Street . Buried: On Tuesday, HMV shocked music lovers when it announced its collapse, four weeks after it warned it was in danger of breaching key loan agreements with its banks . Some experts have been surprised that Blockbuster continued to survive for so long. In the US it collapsed into administration in 2011 but was bought by satellite broadcaster Dish Network which has kept the business going there. Blockbuster dominated the UK film rental market in the 1980s and still has two million regular customers, with sales of £182million for the year to December. But poor trading over Christmas meant it posted a £300,000 loss rather than the £4.5million profit expected. Inevitable: Some were sad to hear of the chain's demise while others were less compassionate about the chain's demise . Customers have been renting fewer DVDs because of the popularity of rival mail order business LOVEFiLM, now owned by Amazon, streaming site Netflix and TV movie channels. Business experts said Blockbuster, like other retailers, had failed to adapt quickly enough to changing consumer habits. Dr Steve Musson, of the University of Reading, added: ‘Rents for retail businesses are usually payable quarterly, with many landlords most recently asking for payment at the end of December, which is why we often see retail failures coming in clusters.’ Business recovery specialist Begbies . Traynor said 140 UK retailers are on its ‘critical’ watchlist. Its . research highlighted more than 13,700 retailers experiencing . ‘significant’ distress in the 11 weeks to December 17, 2012, a 35 per . cent increase from the third quarter. The . 78 store closures announced by EE are in towns where the group . inherited more than one shop from the 2010 merger of Orange and . T-Mobile. More than 500 customer service staff will be redeployed to other branches, but the store managers could face losing their jobs. No hope: Falling demand and online price wars saw photography retailer Jessops go bust last week . 'Devastating effect': Staff from the Warrington branch of Jessops plastered their photos in the window of the store in the hope of finding new employment . Latest casualty: Blockbuster is the latest high street casualty and follows HMV which also called in administrators this week . Blockbuster UK's announcement that it has gone into administration makes it the latest in a long line of high-profile high street firms to fail - the most visible legacy of the financial crisis and subsequent double-dip recession.December 2008: MFI, the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemploymentWoolworthsJanuary 2009: Woolworths shuttered its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first timeFebruary 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer angerBordersDecember 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailersOctober 2012: JJB Sports closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded by Sports Direct - leading to the death of the JJB brand and 550 employees losing their jobs . Casualty of 2012: Comet was one of several household names that went into administration last year . December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyersJanuary 2013: Jessops was closed by administrator PwC earlier this month after years of struggling with online competition as customers turned away from traditional photographyJanuary 2013: HMV, which has 239 shops and 4,500 staff, announced that it was calling in administrators. The company came under fire for not honouring gift vouchers which they had been selling all over Christmas.NEXT? Past Times, Blacks and Hawkin's Bazaar are among the many other firms which have entered administration but been able to survive in some form. However, as the economic recovery remains fragile these companies could tip back into serious trouble. 'Thank you for shopping at Amazon': The Amazon UK fulfillment warehouse in Fife is a million square-feet of storage space and contains almost anything from books to electronic goods. Online retailers such as Amazon have been blamed for reducing footfall on Britain's High Street . Loophole: Amazon made £3.35 billion in sales in Britain in 2011, thanks in part to the fact that its headquarters are based in tax-friendly Luxembourg, allowing it to pay just £1.8million in tax . Blockbuster UK adds its name to the long . list of household names that have entered administration in recent years . as struggling families cut down on spending. The number of High Street chains . going bust has increased by almost a . fifth in two years, figures released last week showed. Some 194 stores and chains fell into . administration during 2012, compared . to 183 in 2011 and 165 during 2010, . according to data from Deloitte. Casualties: Last year saw the demise of La .

'I can't say that I'm disappointed,' Ms Menkhausen, 33, responded holding back tears. She had expressed a desire for twins originally but exclaimed when she saw the scan: 'I'm happy that there's just one.' Writing about the event afterwards she continued: 'We got to see our baby’s glorious heart beating! 'Being able to actually see our little bundle of joy was an indescribably wonderful feeling.' She said friends and family have jokingly tried to console her . by reminding her one baby means 'half the diaper expense, half the clothes . expense, and half the formula expense.'

Healthy fetus: 'Well that's the heart right there,' a doctor explained adding, 'and as I scan through I'm seeing one sac with a really good heartbeat' The ultrasound was performed by Dr. Sherman Silber, director of the Infertility Center of St. Louis, who has been with the couple every step of the way through their IVF experience. Now that he has confirmed the pregnancy his part is complete and Miss Menkhausen and Mr Manion's next step is to make an appointment with an obstetrics and gynecology doctor. 'Being able to actually see our little bundle of joy was an indescribably wonderful feeling' The expectant mother said in her first trimester she has been feeling 'extremely tired, more exhausted than I’ve ever felt.' 'For almost eight years now I have been used to a hectic 60-hour work week schedule, whether it was working full-time and going to school at night, or working full-time during the day and teaching part-time at night. 'I used to hate taking naps because I felt like I was wasting time, but now I look forward to my three to four naps every Saturday and Sunday.' She says that her appetite has also increased and if she doesn't eat every few hours she gets headaches. IVF process: The 33-year-old is seen in the operating theater as 'good embryos' are transferred into her uterus . Road to motherhood: Dr Sherman Silber shows exactly where he placed the embryos . 'I am sure I have gained weight, namely because all my clothes are fitting very snugly,' she added, explaining that she plans to go shopping for maternity wear soon. Ms Menkhausen previously said that she is 'ecstatic' about the prospect of motherhood, after years of struggling to conceive.

Sherman Silber is inserting a micro needle with a little suction into . the ovary and each of these black sacks you see really houses an egg. They're being sucked out and being examined behind us.' Viewers were then told how Ms Menkhausen's eggs would be . transported to the laboratory where her fiance's sperm would be . injected into them to start the fertilization process. Three days later, three 'good embryos' were transferred back into Ms Menkhausen's uterus. Pre-surgery, Ms Menkhausen said that . she wanted to share her journey through fertility treatment to . 'enlighten other women who are having the same challenges.' Creating a baby: Ms Menkhausen's eggs were transported to a laboratory where her fiance's sperm was injected into them to start the fertilization process. Success: Dr Silber holds an image of the embryos he created . 'It’s also a form of . self-enlightenment - sharing my story is helping me deal with some of my . own fears, by courageously facing them head on.' She . had battled fertility issues since a teenager.

Delivering a robust speech at the party's annual conference, the UKIP leader predicted his party would win hundreds of seats on local councils and top the polls in next year's European Parliament elections. And he said UKIP would win its first seats in the House of Commons at the 2015 general election. Scroll down for video of Farage's speech . Defiant: UKIUP leader Nigel Farage said he had succeeded in changing the national debate on Europe, immigration on Syria . He urged the party to put the . issue of immigration from the EU at the heart of its campaign – and use . it  to press the Government to block the free access of migrants from . Romania and Bulgaria, due to start at the beginning of next year. ‘That . is my challenge to them. If they ignore it we must turn the euro . elections into the referendum that we have not been given,’ he said. He . insisted UKIP is not against all immigration, but that ‘sheer weight . of numbers’ is putting too much strain on public services and driving . down wages for the low-skilled. Immigration from Bulgaria and Romania will also see crime gangs flooding in to Britain, he added. But . he said the main parties are powerless to deal with the issue as . clamping down on EU immigration is against Brussels rules. He told activists that by the general election UKIP membership would have overtaken the Lib Dems to become the third largest party in the UK. ‘My ambition and my conviction is we could come first in those European elections and cause an earthquake in British politics,' he said. ‘In a funny way the council elections on that day are even more important to UKIP. ‘I think we have got every opportunity on May 22 next year to win hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of council seats right across the country.’ He sought to recast his party's image, insisting  'we firmly and fiercely oppose racism' and are the 'only party that bans former BNP members from joining'. Out: Mr Farage said he did not just want Britain to leave the European Union, he wanted every country in Europe to leave the EU too . He declared that UKIP are the 'real Europeans', but argued: 'Britain does not need a European future, Britain needs a global future.' He added: 'I don't just want the UK out of the European Union. I want Europe out of the European Union.' 'The other parties are attempting to move into our territory without the slightest intention of doing what we suggest.' He predicted that Labour and the Lib Dems would join the Tories in promising an in-out referendum on Europe. But Mr Farage vowed: 'Let's stand up collectively as a nation and say we want out country back'. Thirsty work: Mr Farage grew increasingly hot and visibly sweaty during the speech and was swiftly handed a glass of water as soon as he finished . In advance of the speech Mr Farage had to face a string of questions about claims he was a racist as a schoolboy. On . the eve of the UK Independence Party’s conference today, Channel Four . News broadcast comments from teachers at Dulwich College that the . teenage Farage was a ‘fascist’ and a ‘racist’ when a pupil at the . private London school in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Education: Mr Farage attended Dulwich College, a private school in south-east London . A letter from 1981 claims Mr Farage, . now 49, was even heard ‘shouting Hitler Youth songs’. The claims did not . prevent him being appointed as a prefect at the school. The . Ukip leader last night played down the significance of the claims, . which he said were made by left-wing teachers who disliked his views. He . denied singing Nazi songs. Mr Farage said: ‘Yes of course I said some ridiculous things, not necessarily racist things. It depends how you define it. ‘You’ve . got to remember that ever since 1968 up until the last couple of years, . we’ve not been able in this country, intelligently to discuss . immigration, to discuss integration, it’s all been a buried subject.’ He added: ‘Was I a difficult, bolshie . teenager who pushed the boundaries of debate further than I should? Yes. Have I ever been a member  of an extremist organisation? No, I have . not.’ Mr . Farage was backed last night by a former Dulwich College master Terry . Walsh, who said the complaints  were ‘probably a reflection on the . staff, not on him – there was quite a strong left-wing element’.","Delivers robust speech seeking to redefine what UKIP stands for .

Quitting: MP Shaun Woodward MP plans to step down from Parliament at the 2015 general election . MP Shaun Woodward, who became a Labour cabinet minister after defecting from the Conservative Party, is to step down from Parliament at the 2015 general election. The former Northern Ireland secretary, who represents St Helens South and Whiston, said he wanted to pursue voluntary and business interests after 18 years in the Commons. Ed Miliband said he had served with 'great distinction' as an MP and minister and paid tribute to the 'most acute strategic advice' he provided to Labour leaders after crossing the floor. The ex-BBC producer was press chief . at Conservative Central Office before becoming MP for Witney - the safe . Tory seat now held by David Cameron - in 1997. He . was made a front-bench spokesman under William Hague but was sacked in . 1999 for supporting the repeal of Section 28, a regulation which . prevented the promotion of homosexual lifestyles in school. Soon . after that he crossed the floor, refusing to quit as MP for Witney, and . in the 2001 general election was handed a safe Labour seat which he won . despite a strong left-wing challenge in protest. After . his re-election in 2005 he was appointed a junior Northern Ireland . minister before moving to culture, media and sport with responsibilities . for the digital TV switchover. In 2007 he was a surprise pick as Northern Ireland Secretary in Gordon Brown's first cabinet - a role for which the wealthy politician, married to Camilla Sainsbury of the supermarket family, took no salary. Writing to Mr Miliband to confirm his decision to quit, he said he had been a 'One Nation' Conservative and that the idea - now adopted by the Labour leader - was 'at the core of my political beliefs'. He said he would focus on human rights issues after leaving Parliament - including as part of a Privy Council review of the use of intercept evidence in court. Quitting: MP Sean Woodward pictured in 2005 shaking hands with Mo Mowlam as he arrives at the Houses of Parliament after defecting to the Labour party . Mr Miliband said his defection had taken 'personal courage and political commitment' and that Labour 'will be forever grateful to you'. He said he had made a 'vital contribution' to the Northern Ireland peace process. 'You have been a great believer in One Nation throughout your career and I am delighted we can count on you as we fight to ensure that it is a One Nation Labour government which serves the country from 2015.' Mr Woodward failed to secure election to the shadow cabinet after Mr Miliband became party leader in 2010 but was kept as shadow Northern Ireland secretary as a discretionary appointment of the leader. He lost the role in a 2011 reshuffle. In 2010 he won his seat with a majority of 14,122.

A council has demanded a ban on electronic betting . machines – dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling – because of the growing . problem of addiction. Fixed-odds betting terminals allow punters to use debit cards and gamble . up to £300 a minute – more than four times faster than casinos’ rate of . play. According to recent research, bookmakers are becoming increasingly reliant on them for revenue, with 80 per cent of their turnover coming from the machines. Money sink: Punters can lose up to £300 per minute on fixed-odds betting machines . Now Liverpool City Council warns people are losing their jobs and homes and turning to loan sharks and crime because they’re hooked on the high-stake, high-speed casino-style games. Last year, an estimated £607million was gambled on the 559 fixed-odds terminals in bookmakers across Liverpool – £1,302 for every man, woman and child in the city. Unlike fruit machines, where cash stakes are limited to £2, gamblers can use their debit cards to lose up to £100 every 20 seconds - more than four times as fast as the rate of play in casinos. The machines, which are highly addictive and have been dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of the gambling world, lead to crime and poverty, say critics. But the gambling industry claims there is no hard evidence that electronic roulette games are dangerous and instead have promised a new code of conduct to allow players to limit their own stakes. Nick Small, the Labour councillor who tabled the motion, said: ‘At the moment we (Liverpool) haven’t got the power to ban these high speed, high stake machines ourselves, but we want the Government to outlaw them, or at the very least give us the power to try to stop their proliferation and bring the rate of play and maximum stake right down. ‘At the moment people can lose £300 a minute and £607million was gambled on these machines in our city alone last year - that’s a staggering amount. ‘I’ve heard stories of ordinary people, doing ordinary jobs, who are going into the bookies on pay day and losing a whole month’s salary or wages in one session. ‘These machines are causing real problems in Liverpool. People are losing their jobs, their relationships are breaking down, they are losing their homes, turning to loan sharks or payday loan firms and even committing crimes because of gambling. ‘Those who say this isn’t a problem should listen to these stories and they will see for themselves that self-regulation isn’t working. Liverpool’s vote is about localism - we need new powers to stop the FOTBs.’ Big draw: Ladbrokes has said that FOBTs account for around 80 per cent of its turnover . According to recent research, bookmakers are becoming increasingly reliant on FOBT for revenue, with more than 80 per cent of their turnover coming from such machines, compared to 20 per cent from traditional over the counter horse racing and sports betting. Ladbrokes announced that £5.9billion was staked on these machines from January to June last year, compared with only £1.2billion for over-the-counter bets. According to the Gambling Commission, there are now more than 33,000 FOBTs in the UK each generating an average weekly profit last year of £825 - up from £760 in 2011. But although the Prime Minister has vowed to ‘have a proper look’ at FOBTs, which have been banned in Ireland and are much more tightly regulated across Europe, the Government has so far refused to act. Last month Culture Minister Maria Miller announced that, following a review, she had rejected calls to cut the maximum stake on electronic roulette machines. In a report, the culture department admitted the ‘potential for harm’ among players using fixed odds terminals was ‘high’, but said it was ‘not clear how great an impact a reduction would have on gambling-related harm’. Derek Webb, founder of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: ‘FOBTs have been a hidden problem for the last 10 years, but the scale of the problems created by these machines is becoming more exposed by the day. ‘I commend the action of Liverpool council in demanding a ban, or at the very least, more powers. Betting shops are no longer about traditional race and sports betting, they are now driven by high speed, high stake, addictive gaming machines that should have no place on the high street.’","Councillors in the city expressed concern over fixed-odds betting terminals .

A teacher gave birth in a classroom the day before she was due to start maternity leave – forcing her  colleagues to act as midwives. Diane Krish-Veeramany, 30, went into labour at 39 weeks just as the morning school bell rang last Thursday. After just 20 minutes of contractions, she gave birth on a chair in an empty classroom helped by three teaching assistants, who took directions from paramedics over the phone to deliver baby Jonah. The school head had rang an ambulance but the healthy 9lb boy arrived before it got there. Mrs Krish-Veeramany, 30, who also has . an 18-month-year-old, Noah, with her husband Vijaye, 31, said the birth . was like nothing she had ever planned. She . said: ‘Everyone who has had a baby knows you try and plan these things . in your head but everything happened so quickly, it was nothing like I . had imagined. ‘It . was so perfect, he’s completely fine, I’m completely fine, and I’m . grateful because otherwise I would have had it in the back of a car.’ Mrs Krish-Veeramany, a junior . teacher, said she had arrived to work at Manford Primary School, in . Hainault, north east London, early to attend Breakfast Club last . Thursday. Shortly after eating a slice of toast she was getting hot flushes and felt a few tightenings, but carried on as normal. Nappy days: Miss Krish-Veeramany with baby Jonah and paramedics after giving birth at Manford Primary School . She said: ‘At about 8.20am I text my husband saying I don’t feel right. Then after a staff meeting I spoke to the head and said I felt a bit funny and couldn’t stay at school. ‘The head asked if I wanted an ambulance but I refused and said it was nothing serious. I was walking to the other side of the school with my teaching assistant when I felt something. ‘The children were about to come in and I said I didn’t want the kids seeing me like this because I didn’t want to frighten them so we went into a classroom that was not being used.’ Teaching assistants (from left) Dita Gojnovc, Chris Sword and Sam Mustafa with their certificates for helping with the birth . She said she sat at a computer desk on a computer chair as her contractions become stronger. Now joined by three teaching assistants, she still refused an ambulance, and was determined to wait for her husband to arrive so he could drive her to hospital. She said: ‘I was adamant I was not going to have a baby on the classroom floor. ‘But twenty minutes after the contractions began and within 40 minutes of telling the head I felt sick a little bundle of joy arrived.’ Colleagues Sam Mustafa, Dita Gojnovci and Chris Sword delivered the baby while taking instructions from paramedics over the phone. Her husband made it just in time for the birth and a teaching assistant caught the baby as he came out at 9.13am - as Mrs Krish-Veeramany remained practically standing. Dad's the word: Mrs Krish-Veeramany's husband made it just in time for the birth . Mrs Krish-Veeramany, from Ilford, Essex, added: ‘One of the midwives (teaching assistants) said you’ve got a boy, and he’s crying.’ By the time the paramedics arrived the baby was already in its mother’s arms. It was only until after the birth that towels were collected from around the school and Jonah was wrapped in a cardigan. Jonah’s first presents were nappies and an outfit from a nearby shop. Mrs Krish-Veeramany said she had been planning to finish work last Friday for a leisurely week off before giving birth. She added: ‘I intended to work until the week before but I didn’t dream I would have to have my baby in a classroom. ‘I’m still in shock, I really am, I can’t believe I had him at school. There was so much hype, all the children were so excited. ‘His dad said he was in such a hurry to get here but he still late for his first day at school.’ Head teacher Tina Jacobs said: ‘We phoned an ambulance but before they could get here she gave birth in an empty classroom with three classroom assistants. It happened so fast. ‘The three classroom assistants were brilliant and I awarded them certificates and medals in Friday’s assembly. ‘Everyone has seen this sort of thing on the television before but you never dream it will happen in real life.’","Diane Krish-Veeramany went into labour minutes before the bell rang .

Birmingham's discredited children’s services unit has been told to improve immediately – or face intervention within weeks by ministers. Bosses were yesterday warned the Department for Education could step in before Christmas to strip the failing service of its responsibilities. The threat follows the deaths of vulnerable youngsters Keanu Williams, two, and seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, which led to the city being branded a ‘national disgrace’ and one of the worst places to grow up in the Western world. Head: Peter Hay, director of children's services at Birmingham City Council, said he would respect any decision that was made . The unit now faces being run by Whitehall . if an inspection this month by education watchdog Ofsted finds . children’s services are failing for the fifth year running. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also warned that the department in England’s second city – where a third of children live in poverty – was in ‘the last chance saloon’. Critics say the move may not make any difference. Following intervention in Doncaster in July following years of failure, the discredited council continues to play a key role. KHYRA ISHAQ . Seven-year-old Khyra was starved to death by her mother and stepfather after social workers missed opportunities because they were said to be more interested in their careers.Khyra had been monitored and visited by at least nine social workers, education officers, teachers and police, but information was not acted upon and procedures were not followed.She died of an infection in May 2008 following a ‘chilling’ punishment regime at her home in Handsworth, Birmingham.Three social workers were disciplined after a report highlighted how some officials were more focused on ‘the rights of the adults’ and the ‘potential impact’ on their careers.KEANU WILLIAMS . The two-year-old had been seen by health workers at least 12 times with signs of abuse such as head injuries and cuts. But children’s services believed his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth when she said they were just bumps and bruises. In reality, Shuttleworth, 25, had beaten her son and his body was found in 2011 with 37 injuries including bite marks, a fractured skull and a tear in his stomach.A report last month revealed Shuttleworth, jailed in June, had been ‘surprised’ he wasn’t taken away from her at birth. It said ‘staff were distracted by his mother’s needs rather than the child’s’. At least three untrained workers – including a student on a work placement – were also put in charge of vital reviews. The latest threat came after Education Secretary Michael Gove this week said he expected more failing authorities to be stripped of their control over children’s services. Birmingham’s children’s services were recently criticised over missed opportunities to protect Keanu Williams before he was murdered by his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth in 2011. In 2008, Khyra Ishaq starved to death at her home in Handsworth, Birmingham, after being withdrawn from school, with children’s care workers again criticised. Ofsted has rated the department inadequate every year since 2009, and the DfE said yesterday another failure later this month would result in ‘further action’. Peter Hay, director of children’s service at Birmingham since July this year, said he would respect whatever decision was taken, but said the priority must be to recruit more social workers. Currently the department has a vacancy rate of a quarter among qualified staff and a third among supervisors, he said. ‘I’ve heard people thinking about jobs say that they’ve been told not to come to Birmingham because it’s a blot on their CV,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘I think that’s unacceptable.’ Mr Hay said the city council’s role would continue to be bringing in ‘the relationships and the money and the investment’ but admitted ‘it can’t do what it has always done’. Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said ministers would look closely at the next Ofsted report. ‘Clearly there have been some lamentable and indeed tragic failures,’ he told a local radio station. ‘And I think it would be a duty for any government that if that report doesn’t show that there have been significant improvements in the way in which the children’s services have been run – given that we have a moral duty to make sure that these terrible cases don’t re-occur – we would then need to step in one way or another.’ Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, branded the warning a ‘complete and utter political move’ by Coalition ministers and suggested the department be broken up and services managed at constituency level. But Sue White, professor of social work at Birmingham University, said constant naming and shaming by Ofsted and ministers was only making the situation worse by deterring capable staff from working there. ‘In my view that process has made the patient sicker,’ she said. ‘The medicine is killing the patient.’ Last month Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw accused Birmingham of a ‘failure on a grand scale’, pointing out that infant mortality there is worse than in Cuba and on a par with Latvia. In Doncaster, local authority services have been passed to a private firm until an independent trust is set up. But the council still retains key powers, including court orders to take children from their parents.

A 40-foot high Playboy bunny logo that had upset some residents of the West Texas town of Marfa will be removed from a roadside display and hauled to a Dallas museum, where it will be featured in an exhibition. The neon bunny that's part of the 'Playboy Marfa' sculpture by New York contemporary artist Richard Phillips will be dismantled this month and taken from U.S. 90 to the Dallas Contemporary museum near the city's downtown. The move to Dallas, about 500 miles northeast of Marfa, is the result of a deal with the Texas Department of Transportation. The bunny will be installed at the museum in March and displayed in April. It will be part of an exhibition highlighting Phillips' work, said museum spokeswoman Erin Cluley. Big, but not with the locals: This Playboy sculpture was set up in June in Marfa, about 180 miles southeast of El Paso, Texas. After upsetting residents, it will be dismantled and moved to Dallas Contemporary museum about 500 miles away . The museum does not keep its art as part of any collection, so the neon bunny will be moved again — it's just not clear where, Cluley said. Peter Doroshenko, executive director of the museum, said Dallas Contemporary has been working with Phillips for a year on his first museum exhibition in the U.S. He said the Playboy piece will be one of several three-dimensional art works displayed along with paintings and drawings. 'I anticipate that the focus and scope of the project will make it one of the highest attended exhibitions in Dallas for 2014,' Doroshenko said. The 'Playboy Marfa' sculpture debuted last June in Marfa, about 180 miles southeast of El Paso. Some Marfa residents were upset that their town — known as a hub for artists and creative types — was being used for marketing purposes. Also, Texas transportation officials said the sculpture lacked a state permit required for outdoor billboards and moved quickly to give Playboy 45 days to remove it. New home: The controversial Playboy bunny sculpture will be moved here, to the Dallas Contemporary museum, this month . 'We have been working to find a solution to this, so we are happy this has been resolved and that Texans will still get to enjoy this piece of art,' said Veronica Beyer, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Transportation. Still unresolved, though, is the fate of a sealed model Prada showroom that has stood for years beside U.S. 90 in the West Texas desert town of Valentine, about 35 miles northwest of Marfa.Transportation officials also deemed that a form of advertising similar to a billboard, meaning it would need to be licensed by the state. However, the area where it is located is not eligible for such permits. 'All I can tell you about Prada is we are working on a solution, but cannot get into specifics yet,' Beyer said.","Sculpture of a Playboy bunny logo that stands 40-feet tall was erected in June in Marfa, an artsy town in West Texas .

The mother of a woman murdered by her cheating husband asked  yesterday: ‘How do we tell three  little girls that their daddy  murdered their mummy?’ Louise Evans, 32, was pushed down the stairs by her husband Alan after she discovered he was having an affair. He then smothered her to death. Evans, 35, tried to disguise his crime by making it look as if she had tripped over a skipping rope and vacuum cleaner. Alan Evans (pictured with his wife on their wedding day), 35, broke down in the dock and held his head in his hands at Worcester Crown Court after being unanimously convicted of killing his wife Louise . Three months later, he continued his affair with 30-year-old married teaching assistant Amanda Chadwick. After he was found guilty yesterday, his mother-in-law Judith Bollen said her ‘happy world’ had been shattered. She said: ‘How do we tell three little girls that their daddy murdered their mummy? ‘For . us, our lives have been changed forever. It is near impossible to . describe the grief, distress and upheaval that Louise’s untimely death . has brought to our lives. ‘Alan’s . attitude and reaction to Louise’s death has been so distressing for us. Since her death, Alan has shown no signs of remorse or regret.’ Judith Bollen (left), mother of Louise Evans, leaves Worcester Crown. Alan Evans, 35, was unanimously convicted of killing his wife Louise today . Mrs Bollen, who prepared her statement in October last year, said her 'happy world' had been shattered by the killing, which she and her husband initially thought was a tragic accident . In her statement, Mrs Bollen accused her daughter's husband of carrying on with his life as if his wife's death meant nothing to him . Judie Bollen, mother of Louise Evans is consoled as she leaves Worcester Crown after Alan Evans is jailed for her daughter's murder. Evans . had a four-month affair with Miss Chadwick, who taught at his . daughters’ school in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, between March and . July last year. They . exchanged more than 2,000 text messages – including dozens of a sexual . nature – and would secretly meet in motels on lunch-breaks and have sex . in their marital beds. To . disguise the affair, Evans tried to encourage his wife to make friends . with Miss Chadwick and her then husband and the couples would go for . walks together. However Mrs Evans, a care worker, found out about the affair several months before her death. Prosecuting . at Worcester Crown Court, Jonas Hankin QC said: ‘Rather than end the . affair, Evans and Amanda Chadwick actually continued to plan for a life . together, even talking about having children.’ Mobile phone records established Evans conducted a four-month affair with family friend Amanda Chadwick (pictured), sending her around 6,700 text messages between dates in March and July last year . Evans, who worked as a welder, claimed during the trial his 32-year-old wife (pictured) had tripped and fallen as he slept in the lounge on the night of July 9 last year . The . court heard that Mrs Evans confronted her husband, a former welder, . about his affair for a second time moments before he attacked her on . July 9 last year. Evans then . ‘pushed’ or ‘threw’ her down the stairs after punching her four times, . then smothered her as she lay unconscious at the bottom, the court . heard. Neighbours reported . hearing Mrs Evans screaming. Once she was dead, Evans placed a hoover . and skipping rope in his wife’s path to make it look like she had . tripped. The court was told she had died at around 11.30pm but an . ambulance was not called for over an hour. Judge . Justice Hickinbottom said: ‘You did not go to her aid, you did not . summon help. You spent part of that hour moving things in your house to . make it appear as though your wife’s death was an accident. The court heard Evans colluded with his mistress (pictured leaving . court) to deceive his wife by sending manufactured text messages to each . other days before her death . ‘You . grotesquely put a skipping rope under your dead wife’s arm and placed a . vacuum cleaner at the top of the stairs, saying to the police and this . court that you found the hose of that device two or three steps down. ‘You maintained this charade that you knew nothing of her death and had slept through a terrible accident.’ Three . months after the murder, Evans and Miss Chadwick went on holiday to . Wales, as a couple, for her mother’s birthday, where she introduced him . to all of her family. The jury was shown photographs of the pair cuddling up together, smiling, on a windy beach. Judge Hickinbottom added: ‘We shall never know precisely what happened at your home that night – only you will ever know that. ‘However, . we do know that every life is precious, that by the account of every . witness Louise was a lovely and loved daughter, family member and . friend. Her death has shattered a happy family and robbed three children . of their devoted mother.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Alan Evans, 35, was unanimously convicted of killing his wife Louise .

Entering the Hooters parking lot, they were greeted by a crowd of cheering Hooters waitresses. Burbach told Oregonlive that some players had other commitments, while others didn't attend because of moral concerns. In a letter to parents on Monday, the school district's athletic director J.P. Soulagnet slammed Burbach and said he tried to get him to move the dinner so 'families could attend and feel comfortable' but he 'was unyielding and emphatically said no.' 'As a school district and athletic department, we do not support nor condone the decision to hold an end of season celebration at Hooters for any of our teams,' Soulagnet wrote in the note.

A rent boy murdered a gay man and 'left him to rot' in his seaside flat for nearly two months after bleeding him dry financially, a court has heard. The badly decomposed body of Michael Polding, 62, was found by police neatly positioned and wrapped up in bedding on July 16 last year. Mr Polding, who lived in a rented two-bedroom basement flat in St George's Road, Brighton, died nearly two months earlier from 'blunt force trauma' to his chest, a jury was told. Prosecutor Philip Katz QC told Lewes Crown Court that he was murdered by Ricardo Pisano, 36, who he met in December 2009 after advertising himself in a gay magazine as a rent boy. Trial: Michael Polding, 62, was found dead in his seaside flat in Brighton allegedly at the hands of Ricardo Pisano, who denies murder and grievous bodily harm . Opening the Crown's case at the start of a five-week trial, Mr Katz said that Pisano, who used a number of different names, moved in with Mr Polding while he lived in Croydon, south London, then followed him down to Brighton. Mr Katz told the jury of nine women and three men: 'The prosecution say that really from the word go this defendant lived off Michael Polding financially. 'He had no job and no income, and when Mr Polding decided to sell up in Croydon and move to Brighton, this defendant moved with him. 'The Crown's case is that this defendant and other friends of his effectively bled Mr Polding dry financially and this defendant, while in this period, pretended to act as his carer and even godson. 'In fact, we say he abused and assaulted Mr Polding, resulting in a serious assault. 'We say that he eventually killed him, and having killed him, left him to rot.' Undiscovered: Michael Polding, 63, was found dead in his flat in St. George's Road, Brighton, pictured, two months after his death . Pisano evaded capture for nearly a year until he was arrested at a house in Southampton, Hampshire, on May 7 under a different name, Mr Katz added. In police interview, Pisano claimed he had come home to Mr Polding's flat to find he had committed suicide by hanging himself from a bannister, towards the end of May last year. Mr Katz said: 'He said he tried and failed to revive Mr Polding and had then panicked. 'He said there were people in South Africa who wanted to kill him and his family and that was why he had been unable to tell anyone about the death of Mr Polding, and that was why he had to flee the scene and not tell anyone what happened.' Mr Polding, who came from a large Scots family, had previously been in a long-term relationship but had been drinking heavily and suffered health problems, including osteoporosis. Despite his numerous problems, his family did not consider him the 'suicidal type', Mr Katz said. Pisano, formerly of Methuen Street, Southampton, denies murder and causing grievous bodily harm but has admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body, the jury has heard. Mr Polding had moved to Brighton for a 'fresh start' after losing his job in Croydon. He used part of the proceeds of the sale of his flat in Croydon to pay a year's rent up-front in Brighton, jurors heard. Emmett Friel, who had lodged at Mr Polding's Brighton flat, was originally arrested on suspicion of his murder but later eliminated from inquiries, Mr Katz said. The evidence to be produced by Mr Friel and a third friend of Pisano's, Hannington Obote, will portray a 'chaotic lifestyle and general fecklessness'. Case: Pisano, denies murder and causing grievous bodily harm but has admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body, Lewes Crown Court heard . Mr Katz told the jury: 'He, Mr Friel, like the defendant, seems to have had few moral scruples about spending Mr Polding's money. 'He will, however, give an insight which the prosecution say will establish that the relationship between Mr Polding and the defendant became increasingly abusive on the defendant's part. 'It shows an escalating pattern of violence on Mr Polding.' In late 2011, early 2012 Mr Friel, Mr Obote and Pisano started setting up a hairdressing salon in north London under the name 'Fate' using Mr Polding's cash. Mr Katz said: 'This money was effectively Mr Polding's and that was being frittered away. This salon only traded in a brief way but it was pretty doomed to fail from the start.' After selling his flat in Croydon, Mr Polding asked one of his sisters to take control of a 'nest-egg' for him using part of the proceeds from the sale. Mr Katz said that a couple of weeks before he died, Mr Polding contacted his sister to ask her to transfer £500, which she agreed to do. Later the same day, he telephoned her again asking for another £100. Mr Katz said that in the background Pisano could be heard asking her to send over more - £1,500. She again complied to his request, and never heard from her brother again. Mr Katz said Pisano used a number of different mobile phones. His claim to police following his arrest that he was in London during a key period proved false as telephone evidence pointed to his devices all being used in the Brighton area, it was claimed. The court also heard that Pisano sent a 'false text' to Mr Polding's mobile after he allegedly murdered him in an effort to shift suspicion. The text said: 'Sweets, I'm still at the shop, worried about Han (Hannington). He went missing. Will be in London for a few days. Meeting Emmett tomorrow. Call me please.' Mr Katz said: 'The prosecution's case is that this was a false text sent to a man (Pisano) knew was dead and was covering his tracks with this rather callous, anxious text, and indeed that text was never read.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Michael Polding, 62, found wrapped in bedding two months after death .

Tragedy: Neville Freeman, 79, (pictured) known as Tony, shot himself dead after suffering months of misdiagnosed crippling abdominal pains that turned out to be cancer . A businessman who correctly feared he had cancer shot himself dead eight months after doctors had misdiagnosed him with stomach ulcers, an inquest heard. Father-of-two Neville Freeman, 79, suffered crippling abdominal pains and had begged for a cancer check because his sister died of the disease after she was misdiagnosed. Experts assured Mr Freeman, known as Tony, that he was cancer-free and prescribed him anti-acid tablets to treat stomach ulcers. But the pain became unbearable and eight months later Mr Freeman took his own life with his clay pigeon gun before a post mortem examination found he did have cancer. After the inquest friends claimed the veteran RAF civilian firefighter would still be alive is his concerns had been listened to. Gary Hughes, 60, who was a neighbour in Feltwell, Norfolk, said he 'lost the will to live' because of the agony he was in. He said: 'I believe Tony thought he had the cancer - like his sister - and he was right. 'He told me he was really fed up. Then they delayed his appointments and that made it worse. 'He hadn't lost his mind, but he lost the will to live. 'Tony was not mentally ill, he was just in so much pain. In the note to me he said he couldn't stand the pain anymore. 'He was in such a bad condition, he couldn't eat or even drink a cup of tea. He felt life wasn't worth living. 'Maybe if he had been diagnosed they could have treated him for cancer and he might still be here. 'It is disappointing that the inquest did investigate why he was misdiagnosed. 'It is worrying to think that what happened to Tony could happen to other people. The reasons why his cancer was not picked up need to be investigated.' Error: Mr Freeman saw medics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk, but was mistakenly told he was not suffering from cancer . He added: 'He had said three of four times about ending his own life but we didn't think he was being serious. 'Even if I had known I don't think there's much I could have done about it.' Mr Freeman, who had owned forestry and transport businesses, shot himself at his home in February. His neighbours found his body in his garage when they called round to take his three dogs for a walk. They found a note attached to the back door and two more in the kitchen. An inquest heard that Mr Freeman was diagnosed with cancer in one of his eyes in 2011 and it was removed and replaced with a glass one. When he developed painful stomach aches in June 2012 he was convinced the cancer had spread. He saw medics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk, but was told he was not suffering from cancer. He went back to his GP when the pain did not go away after taking anti-acid tablets, but was only prescribed painkillers. A post mortem examination revealed a tumour in his pancreas which should have been diagnosed as pancreatic carcinoma. Norfolk Coroner Jacqueline Lake recorded a verdict of suicide at King's Lynn County Court on Monday.","Neville Freeman begged for cancer check after his sister died of disease .

UPDATED: . 12:11 EST, 6 November 2013 . iPhone picture: Dr Erik Scholten took a picture of a woman's 'unusual' genitals to add to his collection . A cosmetic surgeon who took a photograph of a woman's 'unusual' genitals on his iPhone while she was on the operating table is facing a ban from the profession. Dr Erik Scholten, 53, was about to replace the anaesthetised woman's breast implants when he apparently noticed an unusual feature to her genitalia. The father-of-two pointed out what he had seen to a nurse and said: 'Look at hers, she's not complaining.' Scholten then pulled the patient's surgical pants to the side with one hand while taking a picture on his iPhone. The surgeon, who is a specialist in female genital cosmetic surgery, told the Medical Practitioners' Tribunal Service he 'only took one photograph.' Scholten, who has a 'super specialist' interest in women's vaginas planned to put the picture in his portfolio of genitalia to show other patients as a comparison. Dr Scholten was suspended from the Fitzwilliam Hospital in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire after the matron 'dragged him like a naughty schoolboy' to apologise to the woman and her husband. The Dutch medic said he had taken the photograph because there was an unusual amount of skin around the woman's clitoral hood. But the panel, chaired by Dr Malcolm Phillips, today found him guilty of serious misconduct and he now faces a possible ban from the profession. 'The panel has no doubt that the public at large would be appalled at what you have done. The medical profession has self-evidently been brought into disrepute,' said Dr Phillips. 'The panel accepts that your conduct constitutes a single act but considers it to be serious. 'It involved a deliberate act in which you pulled aside Patient A's surgical underpants in order to photograph the exposed area. 'The panel considers it inconceivable that, as an experienced doctor, who undertook this form of surgery on a regular basis and had frequent experience of both consent and photography, you did not recognise the significance of your actions. 'Furthermore, on your own evidence, you took a willful decision to take the photograph even when questioned by a colleague.' The . woman underwent the operation to have her PIP breast implants removed . at the private hospital run by Ramsey Health Care on February 27 last . year. She gave her consent . for the surgeon to capture before and after photographs of her breasts . and was taken into the theatre where she was anaesthetised. Incident: Dr Erik Scholten was about to replace a woman's breast implants at the private Fitzwilliam Hospital (pictured) in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, when he took the photo without her consent, the tribunal heard . When nurse Denise Jackman questioned the doctor about the image he told her it was fine as the patient could not be identified from the picture. 'I was surprised she was exposed in . that area. It was surreal. I could not quite believe it had happened and . it stunned me,' Miss Jackman said in a statement. The tribunal heard the patient's husband was so furious he wanted to punch Scholten. In her statement the patient describes . the matron 'dragging Dr Scholten behind her' and says 'he was very . embarrassed about having been dragged in like a naughty schoolboy.' She added: 'I feel I have lost my trust in the profession. 'I have an unrelated operation coming up and I'm just really nervous about it wondering what might happen.' 'It was wrong. I took a photograph . without her consent. I got carried away by my super specialist interest . and I'm fully aware that was wrong' Dr Erik Scholten . Just days after the operation, on March 5, Dr Scholten made a phone call to a 'stunned' patient to tell her he had been suspended. On the same day she received a letter from his solicitor apologising 'unreservedly' and stating he had taken the photo to put in a portfolio of women's genitalia to show to other patients. It read: 'I am always adding to my portfolio of different female genitalia to show prospective patients and I was hoping, with your consent, to do so with yours. 'I would have discussed this with you and, of course, had you objected, I would have disposed of the imagery immediately.' Dr Scholten was temporarily suspended by the General Medical Council in April 2012 ahead of today's hearing. However, he was allowed to return to work under supervision following a High Court ruling in January. He now faces a full ban from the profession after being found guilty of misconduct. Giving evidence, Dr Scholten said the case has had a 'catastrophic' impact on his life and he is now bankrupt, has had his BMW repossessed and has been forced to sell his three-storey Bedford home. 'It was wrong. I took a photograph without her consent. I got carried away by my super specialist interest and I'm fully aware that was wrong,' he said. 'It was a devastating episode in my life and perhaps also in the patient's life and I'm therefore grateful the GMC have not asked the patient to appear here as a witness because that would have been devastating for her.

A businessman branded his estranged wife a ‘greedy cow’ for refusing a £27million settlement during their bitter divorce battle, a court heard yesterday. Scot Young, 51, a ‘fixer’ to the super-rich and a property tycoon who was said at one point to be worth £400million, now insists that he is penniless and in debt. But his estranged wife Michelle, 49, is fighting a high-profile court battle with him. She claims he is hiding his fortune to prevent her from getting a sizeable divorce settlement. Claims: Scot Young, left, says he is broke but estranged wife Michelle, right, insists he is still wealthy . A judge heard yesterday that he had told an . acquaintance he preferred using cash so that Mrs Young could not 'keep . track' of his spending habits. Mr Young, 51, is said to have once been worth as much as £400million, but now claims he is penniless as a result of the global financial crisis and recession. He was known to be a 'fixer' to the super-rich as well as a property dealer, and apparently associated with the likes of Simon Cowell, Sir Philip Green and the late Boris Berezovsky. Mrs Young, 49, told the divorce hearing that her husband was worth 'a few billion at least' adding that she would be willing to settle for £300million as well as her legal costs. Paparazzi photographer Dennis Gill told the court that he discussed the couple's situation with Mr Young outside upmarket Japanese restaurant Nobu in 2009. 'He said he would pay me £2,000 in cash tax-free if I would follow his wife on Friday taking a video and photos of whom she was with', Mr Gill's sworn affidavit read. 'I said ""OK sure"" and he said he would call me. Scot then said, ""Between me and you mate, I offered her £27million and she refused it, only a greedy cow would refuse that."" 'He then said, ""What greedy cow would refuse that?"" I said that was not for me to say. He told me to keep it under my hat and not to tell anyone. 'He continued chatting and told me that he pays for everything in cash so that his wife cannot keep track of what he is spending.' Couple: Mr Young with his new girlfriend Noelle Reno at a party earlier this year . However, when he was giving evidence orally Mr Gill distanced himself from his written statement, saying that he is deaf and may have misheard Mr Young. 'To the best of my knowledge, I did hear him say that, but I could have misinterpreted, because of my ears,' he said. 'It could have been wrong, it could have been right.' But at another point in the proceedings, he insisted he was '1000 per cent sure' that Mr Young made the remarks attributed to him. Mr Gill also told the hearing that Mrs Young, who claims to live in a bedsit and rely on food hand-outs, was lying about her lifestyle. 'I have seen Michelle at many of the most exclusive nightclubs,' he said, adding that he had seen her partying with TV star Donna Air, who is dating the Duchess of Cambridge's brother. He asked: 'How can she afford to go to one of these places, and she is telling me she's broke?' Mr Young's former solicitor Stanley Beller told how he fell out with the tycoon after a business deal went sour and the lawyer was later struck off. He accused the businessman of taking £13million worth of share certificates from his office. Mr Young, who had been a guest at the bar mitzvah of Mr Beller's son, repeatedly accused his former friend of lying, but the lawyer responded: 'I'm not going to sit here and be called a liar by this cheat.' Earlier this year Mr Young was jailed for three months after being found guilty of contempt of court for refusing to reveal information about his finances. The couple, who began a relationship in 1989 and had two children before splitting in 2006, have been engaged in divorce proceedings for several years. The High Court hearing continues.","Scot Young is being sued by estranged wife Michelle for a share of millions .

John Miller, 36, 'slaughtered' his partner and eight-year-old daughter but spared his 'pure Aryan' youngest daughter . A father butchered his partner and their eight-year-old daughter in a cannabis-induced psychotic frenzy, a court heard yesterday. John Miller, 38, spared their other daughter, aged four, because she was a ‘true Aryan with blonde hair and blue eyes’. The family had a ‘last meal’ together at home and watched Coronation Street before Miller – a drug abuser who had smoked skunk cannabis for years – erupted in violence as teacher Sarah Laycock, 31, was putting the girls to bed. He said he heard voices in his head and was told by ‘electrical signals’ to kill his family members, Leeds Crown Court was told. Miss Laycock was thrown downstairs and killed by Miller in the kitchen. She was stabbed 19 times – once through her eye – with a knife before being hit four times in the face with an axe. Miller then killed Abigail in the living room. The schoolgirl put up a ‘considerable struggle’ as her father stabbed her nine times, severing an artery in her neck. He later slit his wrists and was found wandering around a nature reserve, beating his chest and ‘growling like an animal’. It took a team of police officers two hours to arrest the fitness fanatic using ‘sheer brute force’. Police found four-year-old Amelia in the house in Garforth, West Yorkshire, with the family’s dog. The youngster had been alone for more than 12 hours with the bodies of her mother and sister. Miller, who was a member of the BNP and described as ‘overtly racist’, said he spared Amelia because of her ‘DNA’. He carried the girl upstairs after the horrific attacks, and warned her to stay in a bedroom. Miller attacked deputy head partner Sarah in the kitchen with a knife, stabbing her 19 times in the face . A court packed with family heard Miller then attacked little Abigail with a bladed weapon. When police found the small body in the living room of the family home she was still dressed in her nightdress . In his interview Miller said he had thrown Sarah down the stairs before attacking her. After being arrested he made 'overtly racist' remarks, claiming that all people with brown eyes had 'muddied the gene pool' The Garforth home of the mother and daughter who were brutally killed by Cannabis user John Miller . Leeds Crown Court heard that plasterer Miller had picked his daughters up from school on January 13 last year, telling them they 'needed to hurry home because there is going to be a nuclear war . Miller pleaded guilty to manslaughter by . reason of diminished responsibility and was yesterday jailed for life, . with a minimum term of 15 years. The court heard the plasterer was . mentally ill at the time of the incident in January 2012 and the one-off . violent ‘psychotic episode’ was probably the result of taking cannabis, . cocaine and steroids for many years. 'I've had no reprieve, no release for good behaviour. 'My daughter and granddaughter - brutally and violently murdered - their basic human rights removed - their right to live. 'Everything I've worked for is now gone. 'Everything I planned for has gone. The lifestyle I accepted as the norm has been shattered.' The father-of-two later told . psychiatrists he believed there was going  to be a nuclear war and he . was instructed by messages from his computer to kill them. The judge . dismissed defence claims that he was a paranoid schizophrenic and . decided he was fit to serve a prison sentence rather than go to . hospital. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Coulson described the offences as . ‘appalling’ and said they were ‘particularly heinous crimes’. The . court heard he slit his wrists and waded into a lake at Fairburn Ings . nature reserve, but didn’t go through with the suicide attempt. Paramedics were called to treat him but they ran away from the ambulance when he became violent. Michelle . Colborne, QC, prosecuting said that when police officers arrived Miller . was standing on a bank ‘beating his chest and grunting and growling in . an animal’s voice’. A ‘large number’ of officers eventually . overpowered him. Miller initially told police his girlfriend had died in . an accident. But officers went to the house where they found Amelia at . the top of the stairs cuddling the family’s dog Rex. She had no serious . physical injuries. Amelia later told her aunt that she was ‘scared’ of her father and asked if he would ever be released from jail. Her one . question was ‘what was the size of the padlock on Daddy’s door?’. The . dead teacher’s father Christopher Laycock said in a victim impact . statement: ‘Everything I have worked for has gone, everything I have . planned has gone. The lifestyle I accepted as the norm is shattered.’ Detective . Superintendent Lisa Griffin said outside court Miller had ‘no history . of mental illness and no one could have predicted or prevented this . terrible tragedy’. She added: ‘Sarah Laycock was a loyal partner, . loving mother and a hard-working deputy head teacher. She did nothing to . provoke her violent death and everything to love and protect her children.'","John .

A teenager hanged herself at the same tree where her elder brother took his own life after she was assaulted during a night out, an inquest has heard. Upset Abigail Pollard had been out with a friend when they got into an argument with another group and she was assaulted. The 17-year-old returned home, only to leave again despite her mother Nicola begging her to stay. Tragedy: Tributes left at the spot where siblings Dean and Abigail Pollard took their own lives 11 months apart. The tree has been felled at the request of their family . Just minutes later she was found dead, at the same spot near the house where her brother Dean had died in February 2012. 'If Dean hadn't committed suicide then Abi wouldn’t have done,' ambulance driver Ms Pollard told the inquest into her daughter's death. 'And if Dean, Abi . and myself had received appropriate help from social services when we . asked for it, then none of us would be in this room today.' Newcastle Coroner Karen Dilk heard how Abigail had been known to the local authority for more than a decade after behavioural problems at home and school. The hearing was also told that had attempted suicide twice following the death of her . brother, although in the month before her death . social workers and her mother believed she was getting better. 'She was a vulnerable young person,' said social worker Victoria Chamberlain. 'And there were concerns about her home life and brother’s death. 'She also had alcohol issues but she had a really good support network and was engaging with drug and alcohol services. 'When . we saw her in the December things were going well, her relationship . with her mother was improving and she was considered a low risk, with no . immediate concerns about self harm.

Upset: On the night of her death Abigail had been out with a friend in Newcastle city centre when she was assaulted. She returned home to her mother only to leave again in a state of distress, the inquest heard . She then returned to her mother’s house, in Brunswick, in the early hours of January 13. 'Abi was drunk but not stumbling,'  Ms Pollard said. 'But she was upset. 'I kept asking, ‘What’s wrong? Where’s your friend? Why is there mud on your jacket?’ but she said nothing. “She went to leave and I said, ‘Please don’t do this’ but she went off and I was left stood at the front door in my dressing gown.' Ms Pollard said she then tried to call Abigail's iPhone, only to speak to a man who had found it - and told her he would take it to a police station. 'I spoke to him for a little while, and thought she’d be over the moon that she’d get her iPhone back again,' she said. 'I went upstairs and got my clothes on and went out looking for her. It was maybe only 10 or 15 minutes after she’d left.' Abigail was found in a copse of trees nearby and emergency services called, but despite efforts to resuscitate her it was not possible to revive her. The coroner recorded that Abigail’s death was a suicide. Yesterday, tributes could still be seen to the brother and sister, sat on the stump of where the pair died. A spokesman for Newcastle City Council confirmed it had felled an 'elder shrub' following a request by the family.

The mother of the four-year-old girl mauled to death by her pet bulldog had seen a sign at the re-homing centre warning it was not suitable for children but was told it was 'fine as long as he wasn't allowed to jump up'. As Lexi Branson's grandmother said she 'could kill' staff at the centre that placed the former stray with her family, it has emerged the girl's mother Jodi Hudson had been concerned at a poster of the dog which included a warning it was unsuitable for 'small children'. But when she asked about the sign she was told the dog would be fine if it wasn't 'allowed to jump up', a friend has said. My pet: Lexi with the dog that would kill her weeks later in an unprovoked attack . Police said Lexi Branson was attacked without provocation in the flat she shared with mother Jodi Hudson who took a knife to the animal in a bid to save her daughter. Yesterday, Miss Hudson, 30, paid tribute to her ‘bright, bubbly girl’ in a joint statement with her mother, Kerry. They said Lexi was a ‘shining star in the sky who would never be forgotten’. A friend of Miss Hudson told the Daily Mirror Miss Hudson saw the dog advertised by the centre on Facebook and paid £100 for it. The friend said: 'There was a poster of the dog inside the centre which stated underneath it was unsuitable for people with small children. 'But Jodi asked them about this and they said he'd be fine as long as he wasn't allowed to jump up.' Grandmother Kerry has said she held Willow Tree Dog Rehoming Centre ‘responsible’ because it had allowed the dangerous dog to be taken into the home with a child. Problematic: The bulldog named Mulan who savaged Lexi had only been with the family a few weeks after being found wondering in a park by a warden and taken to an animal shelter .

They deserve whatever they get now. ‘I don’t know whether or not they knew she had a little girl.’ The rehoming centre in Barrow-upon-Soar, Leicestershire, is understood to have placed the dog, named Mulan, with Miss Hudson and Lexi at their housing association flat in the nearby village of Mountsorrel in September. Willow Tree holds the contract to provide kennelling for strays picked up by Leicester City Council. The animal had been taken to the centre after being found wandering in a park by a warden in August.

She had previously described Lexi . as her ‘little miracle’ because she was born three months premature, at . 1lb 1oz. Neighbours had blamed a French Mastiff which had also been staying at the flat.

A father and son who blackmailed a company boss with compromising pictures of his married business colleague after a £180million deal turned sour have both been jailed for eighteen months. They demanded £35,000 to prevent the images - which showed the man being straddled by the half naked woman in a Dubai hotel room - being put on the internet, damaging the international company’s reputation, and shown to the subject’s wife. Karim Ashikali, 57, and Mohamedraza Ashikali, 26, both of Stanmore, claimed the blackmail complaint was invented to cut them out of a lucrative deal, during a trial at Isleworth Crown Court. Karim Ashikali, 57, (left) and Mohamedraza . Ashikali, 26, (right) are accused of blackmailing a company boss with pictures of his married business colleague and a half-naked woman in a Dubai hotel room . They had told the court that Mohamedraza - known as Mo - is owed £35,000 in wages by the company. Both men were found guilty of making an unwarranted demand with menaces against the businessman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, between November 6 and November 20 last year. The businessman and the Ashikalis had a meeting at the company’s HQ in South Kensington on November 6, after a fruitless investment trip by both defendants to Dubai resulted in Mohamedraza parting company with the consulting firm. The jury heard the company boss’s colleague - identified as Mr B - was photographed stripped to the waist in a Dubai hotel room, lying underneath a mystery woman wearing only a bra and knickers. 'When they came in Mo held his phone up and showed me the pictures. 'They were of Mr B with a woman sitting astride him, taken from two different angles,' explained the businessman. 'The only reason the Ashikalis came to me was to discredit him.' Mohamedraza also threatened to tell Mr B’s wife that her husband was enjoying a fling with an attractive young female member of staff at the company, and had a recording of the employee confirming the affair. 'He said he was going to post the images on the internet. 'He was never owed any outstanding salary. That is money he wanted to keep quiet, to not tell Mr B’s wife.' The Ashikalis failed to find investors for the company while in Dubai, but Karim claimed the Saudi Arabian consul-general could authorise a deal that would generate huge profits. It is claimed they demanded £35,000 to prevent the images - which showed the man being straddled by the woman - being put on the internet, damaging the international company's reputation, and shown to the subject's wife, Isleworth Crown (pictured) Court heard . However, the businessman says the deal was flawed and Mr B agreed with him, denying there was any motivation to 'cut out' the Ashikalis. With the consul-general demanding nine-tenths of the commission, the businessman told the court: 'It would have been illegal. Totally illegal.' He also told the court his company 'lost complete faith' in the Ashikalis efforts to source investment in the Middle East. 'Some of those investors were not investors at all. They were trying to take our money.' The businessman said he reported the Ashikalis after cash demands were made following the meeting when the compromising pictures were revealed. 'We discussed it after receiving an email saying Karim wanted money and then we went to the police. We took it as a demand.' He said Karim emailed him claiming time was running out to stop his son going public, warning: ‘I don’t think I can hold him [Mo] off much longer!!'","Karim and Mohamedraza Ashikali demanded £35,000 for the images .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 05:45 EST, 7 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:50 EST, 7 November 2013 . Nick Clegg yesterday accused Jeremy Paxman of sneering at politics while making £1million a year reporting on it. The BBC Newsnight host has admitted he failed to vote at a recent election and has criticised the ‘green-bench pantomime’ in Parliament. But he was denounced by the Lib Dem leader, who said on his LBC Call Clegg show: ‘He’s a guy who gets paid £1million or thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers, he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics. Scroll down for videos . Criticism: Nick Clegg accused Jeremy Paxman of an abdication of responsibility for sneering at politics . ‘Politics is imperfect...but at the . end of the day it is the way that we decide how you pay your taxes, how . we support our hospitals, our schools, whether we go into war or not, . how we deal with climate change. ‘It’s sometimes unedifying, but this . idea that you just can sneer at the whole thing, dismiss everybody as . being rogues and charlatans, and say, well therefore I’m going to wash . my hands of the whole thing, is a total abdication of responsibility.’ Mr Clegg launched the outspoken attack on the BBC star for claiming he finds the crop of politicians so ‘unappetising’ he could not be bothered to vote. The Lib Dem leader said he had an ‘old-fashioned view’ that anyone unhappy with politics should ‘get stuck in’ and change things not sneer from the sidelines. He said Mr Paxman, as one of the BBC’s most high profile political interviewers, had a responsibility not to undermine democracy. ‘I just have this old fashioned view if you want to improve something get stuck in and get your hands dirty and change. Don’t somehow pretend you can turn your back on it,' he said. Mr Paxman has admitted his refusal to vote should disqualify himself from commenting on political affairs. Grilling: Mr Paxman is one of the BBC's top political interviews, and has often confronted Mr Clegg on Newsnight . Jeremy Paxman has also turned on his fellow BBC journalists for taking part in shows like Children In Need and Strictly Come Dancing. He said he would pay good money 'not to watch newsreaders making t**** of themselves.' In an interview with BBC Radio 2's Steve Wright he said: 'I don’t understand why they want to do it', although he did admit that it helped to raise money for the children's charity. He revealed he had twice been approached by producers of Strictly Come Dancing to appear on the show, but said: 'You want your head examined to do that.' Mr Paxman's BBC News colleague, Susanna Reid, is currently appearing on the latest series of Strictly. And it comes just days after fellow Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark ended last Halloween’s edition of Newsnight with a dance. But he said he agreed with comedian Russell Brand’s recent assessment that voters are ‘disillusioned’. Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Paxman said: ‘In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising. ‘By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write “none of the above” on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.’ Mr Clegg’s outburst came after a . listener complained that too often new governments spend their time . unpicking the work of their predecessors. Instead, . every constituency should have a Tory, Labour and Lib Dem . representative elected separately who would sit in Westminster in . permanent coalition, it was suggested. But Mr Clegg dismissed the idea out of . hand: ‘I don’t agree that we eliminate choice, eliminate the . argie-bargie of politics, unattractive though it might seem at times. ‘Of course, imperfect though our democracy is, at the end of the . day it’s the best way we can have people articulating conflicting views . about the future and resolve them peacefully, and then govern the . country as well as we possibly can on behalf of the people - in a way . which is legitimate because it's backed by whatever happens in . elections.’ The row over voting was sparked by an interview Mr Paxman conducted with Russell Brand, in which the comedian said he had never voted because he regarded politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant. Despite criticising Mr Brand during the interview, Mr Paxman later admitted he had some sympathy with his position. 'Russell Brand has never voted because he finds the process irrelevant. I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo-chamber. But it is all we have,' Mr Paxman said.","Deputy Prime Minister accuses presenter of 'abdication of responsibility'

Ruined future: Gurinder Ranshi, 23, was two years into a degree to become an optician when he was caught by police raiding a couple's home with a masked gang . A university student is starting a jail sentence after he ‘threw away’ his bright future by taking part in a terrifying raid on a couple's home. Former private schoolboy Gurinder Ranshi, 23, was two years into a degree course to become an optician when he joined an armed masked gang who burst into a house and robbed a couple. One of the gang beat the man with a metal bar as his girlfriend watched in horror. Ranshi then helped another man ransack the house. When police arrived at the house in Hyde, Greater Manchester, Ranshi tried to flee by leaping from an upstairs window, said prosecutor Adam Lodge. But he fractured his spine as he landed and was arrested. Ranshi, a charity worker whose father Mita is an optician, had never been in trouble with police before. He grew up in a sprawling detached home in Sale and was a pupil at William Hulme’s Grammar School before it scrapped its £7,400-a-year fees. Ranshi, who is studying at the University of Bradford, was a talented schoolboy golfer who won a hat-trick of top junior trophies at Withington Golf Club. He denied any wrongdoing and said he was forced to commit the burglary by other men. But a jury found him guilty of aggravated burglary after a trial at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court. Ranshi, who was wearing a brace to support his back, nodded to his family in the public gallery as he was jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told Ranshi: 'I still find it difficult as to why you would become involved in something like this, with the parents you have. 'In the course of one night you have thrown away all that you have worked for in two years of university education.' But the judge added: 'Home, for anyone, is the last refuge. Everyone should expect to feel safe in their own home.' Two other men involved in the raid in . January 2012 were also jailed. Joseph Duffy, 30, of Offerton, who . attacked the householder while the others searched for cash, was jailed . for seven years. Sentencing: Ranshi was jailed for seven-and-a-half years at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court after being found guilty of aggravated burglary . He had earlier admitted aggravated burglary, possession of an offensive weapon and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Jonathan O’Connor, 25, of Middleton, was found guilty of aggravated burglary after a trial. He was jailed for nine years. Ranshi claimed in court he was going with O’Connor and Duffy to their friend’s house on the night and did not know of the raid until he arrived. His father Mita declined to comment on the case. But a neighbour said: 'They had everything, his family did everything for him and he never wanted for anything - perhaps that was the problem. 'You could not meet a nicer family. They will be devastated.'","Gurinder Ranshi was two years into a degree course to become an optician .

Speaking at the Breast Cancer Care lunch at Champneys Tring health spa, she said: ‘I’m 53 in December and I’ve just signed another five-year contract, so I think that probably blows a few holes in the argument of people who say that older women can’t be a success in television. 'I’m the longest-serving British newsreader. That’s quite a lot of longevity, isn’t it? ‘I was staggered, to be honest … and apparently I’ve also done more live broadcasting than anybody else in the world.’ ‘Apparently there is some chap in America who’s done about 16,000 hours and apparently I’ve done 20,000 hours. Isn’t it amazing? It’s incredible. I can’t believe it. ‘It feels like yesterday that I joined the company. I suppose it’s because it doesn’t feel like work because I love my job, I love what I do for a living. ‘I’m not expecting a trophy, I’m just safe in the knowledge that I can continue to do for another five years the best job in the world. I love my job and I’m very lucky and privileged to be able to do it. ‘I’m very content to be with Sky. I was there when it was just great big potholes in the car park, and now we have something like 130 million viewers around the world. I was recently on safari on holiday and I was recognised on the Zimbabwe/Botswana border, which was a bit weird but it made me think, “We reach all of these people”.’ At a Breast Cancer Care lunch she hit back at critics such as Sir Terry Wogan, who last week claimed ageing female presenters should not complain when they are replaced as they often use their looks to land TV roles as young women.

A gang who attacked a young soldier from Prince Harry's old air base like a 'pack of wolves' have been jailed. The five-strong gang were seen jubilantly 'bumping fists' as Jack Shilton, 21, lay unconscious after they'd repeatedly punched him in the face and kicked him in the head. Mr Shilton, of the Army Air Corps, who maintains helicopters at RAF Wattisham, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, was on leave when he was attacked. His high-profile air force station hit the headlines when Prince Harry was based there in 2011-12 as he learned to fly the Apache gunship chopper. The gang members were branded cowardly, despicable and a disgrace by a judge after they stole Mr Shilton's wallet and phone and dragged him along the ground by his underpants in the brutal late-night attack in Ipswich. Scroll down for video . Brutal: The gang were caught on CCTV demanding soldier Jack Shilton, 21, to hand over his wallet before attacking him in Ipswich . Violent: A court heard how the gang acted like a 'pack of wolves' as they beat Mr Shilton to the ground . The soldier, who served his country in Afghanistan, had gone out to celebrate with his Army colleague Peter Scott, who'd just returned from a tough tour fighting the Taliban in Helmand. Judge Rupert Overbury told the court how the gang had pounced like 'a pack of wolves determined on its prey' on the soldier. He said there was an 'element of degradation' as one of the thugs booted the defenceless serviceman as he lay on the ground and another hauled him along the road. Judge Overbury told the defendants at Ipswich Crown Court: 'While your victim has served this country, your country, in Afghanistan, to protect you and the rest of us from the threat of future harm, you have behaved in a cowardly and despicable fashion. 'Each of you is a disgrace to your family and a disgrace to your community.' Jerran Hart, 22, of Ipswich, and Adam Poulter, 26, of no fixed address but from Ipswich, denied robbing Mr Shilton on June 6. But they were found guilty after a trial at the court in September. Poulter was jailed for three years and nine months and Hart was sentenced to three years and six months in prison. 'Cowards': The five men then continued to attack Mr Shilton as he lay defenceless on the ground . Injuries: Mr Shilton was left with a bruised kidney and several suspected broken ribs from the assault . Matthew Kersey, 30, of Ipswich, admitted robbing Mr Shilton and assaulting his friend Peter Scott. Jamie Duncan, 23, of Ipswich, admitted robbery. Kersey was locked up for 32 months and Duncan for 30 months. Mitchell Ambrose, 20, also of Ipswich, admitted robbery and will be sentenced at a later date. The court heard that Mr Shilton had blood pouring from his mouth when he came round after being knocked out in the assault. The traumatised serviceman ran to a nearby house for help and was taken to Ipswich Hospital with a bruised kidney, lumps on his head and suspected broken ribs. Mr Shilton and Mr Scott were attacked on their night out after they met the gang, who invited them to a house party. They got a taxi to the venue but decided to leave after discovering there was no party. Mr Shilton, attached to the crack quick reaction unit, 16 Air Assault Brigade, got into a cab but jumped out again when he saw Mr Scott being chased by the yobs. The cabbie sped off and Mr Shilton was surrounded by the five men as they demanded his wallet, phone and PIN number. Found guilty: Jerran Hart, 22, pictured left, was found guilty of robbery after a trial and sentenced to three years and six months.  Adam Poulter, 26, pictured right, was also found guilty by a jury of robbery and sentenced to three years and nine months . Pleaded guilty: Matthew Kersey, 30, pictured left, pleaded guilty to robbery and assault and was jailed for 32 months. Jamie Duncan, 23, pictured right, also admitted robbery and was jailed for 30 months . The frightened soldier handed them over thinking they would leave him alone but they started to punch him in the face. Mr Shilton collapsed to the ground and was kicked repeatedly in the head and back. Steven Dyble, defending Kersey, said he had written to the soldier to apologise. He said Kersey had been drinking. Matthew Sorel-Cameron, for Duncan, said he accepted punching Mr Shilton and was ashamed. Christopher Paxton, defending Poulter, said he had not threatened the victim or used any violence and had only played a peripheral role. Ian Persaud, for Hart, said he had not menaced Mr Shilton or confronted him. Det Insp Eamonn Bridger, of Suffolk Police, said: 'This was a particularly nasty unprovoked attack on the victim, a serving soldier on leave, who co-operated with the offenders and handed over his property. 'They still felt the need to surround him and assault him, causing him to fall to the ground unconscious. 'They then continued the assault whilst he lay vulnerable on the floor.'

Barclays is to close some bank branches and move them in to Asda supermarkets in a new ‘open all hours’ approach. Eight will be switched during 2014, while more will follow in a policy that is expected to be taken up by the other mainstream banks. The move will save Barclays a fortune because it will be able to sell off existing buildings, however it could upset and disrupt many loyal customers. At the same time it could harm existing . high streets, where retailers would lose the passing trade associated . with people visiting bank branches and cash machines. Closures: Barclays is to close eight branches across the UK next year with more to follow (stock image) There also concerns that the range of services, particularly to small businesses, will be curtailed. On a positive note, the new supermarket bank branches will open for the same hours as the supermarket, seven days a week, which is longer than normal. Staff will only be on duty during normal bank hours, however there will be machines in place at other times to allow people to do simple things like pay bills and pay in or take out cash. Barclays also insisted that services to small businesses in terms of paying in a large number of cheques, or withdrawing large cash sums will be maintained. The move by Barclays follows an earlier decision by the Post Office to move many of its outlets in to branches of WHSmith, which has not been entirely successful. Customers have complained of a lack of staff and long queues at some outlets. The first Barclays branch to go is in the Birchwood shopping centre in Warrington, where services and staff will move to a nearby Asda in February. The next three to close will be in Albion Street, Broadstairs, Kent, Manor House Street, Pudsey, Leeds, and St Albans Road, Watford. Steve Cooper, Head of Barclays Retail and Business Bank said the change will help people to shop and bank at the same time. Longer hours: The closed branches will be relocated in Asda stores and will operate the same opening hours as the supermarket . ‘We’ve spoken to our customers who use our everyday and business banking services in our branches and they’ve told us their time is precious so would benefit from being able to multi-task, park easily and visit branches with longer opening hours,’ he said . Asda’s Karen Hubbard, said: ‘This is the next step in the evolution of how we continue to make our stores relevant to our customers’ everyday needs, giving them access to banking services to use at their convenience – when they want, and how they want it. ‘Access to banking services is an under-rated but important asset to any community but in many areas, these services just aren't available to families. In partnership with Barclays, we’ll trial banking services in our stores for the communities which need it the most.’ The Campaign for Community Banking Services fears high streets could lose out once the branches close. Director, Derek French, said: ‘If relocation to an Asda is the alternative to losing the branch altogether it has to be welcomed and clearly will reduce costs for Barclays. ‘However, a big question is whether the in-store outlet will provide the same transactional services to small businesses and charities as the conventional branch. ‘Also, location is important and many large supermarkets these days are sited away from the traditional high streets. What we see when banks pull out of local high streets is serious loss of business by other retailers as people and businesses from the surrounding area no longer come into the high street to bank and therefore no longer spend locally.’ Previous experiments with moving banks in to other retailers have not been successful. Lloyds tried it with Asda between 1997 and 2002, while HSBC did something similar with Morrisons. All the outlets subsequently closed.","Eight branches will be switched during 2014 with more to follow .

The Duchess of Cambridge said she was taking flying lessons - but the suggestion Prince Harry is her instructor has not been confirmed . The Duchess of Cambridge has revealed she's learning to fly a plane - and she may even be being taught by Prince Harry. The 31-year-old, who gave heart to other new mothers by appearing with what looked like a few grey roots, told a group of RAF officers that she had been taking lessons in a fixed-wing aircraft, as opposed to the helicopters flown by both her husband and brother-in-law. Kate, whose father was a dispatcher for British Airways and mother was an airline hostess, said: 'My grandfather [the late RAF pilot Peter Middleton] flew planes.  I've had a few lessons on fixed wing.' But Kensington Palace would not confirm the rumour that Kate was being taught by her Apache helicopter commander brother-in-law.  Prince Harry took lessons in flying fixed wing planes at the Army Air Corps base in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, in 2008. The Duchess of Cambridge looked as elegant as ever as she helped promote the Poppy Appeal in London yesterday. She and her husband, Prince William, surprised commuters at High Street Kensington underground station yesterday when they made the short journey from their home in Kensington Palace on a classic 1960s London Routemaster bus, accompanied by forces personnel and poppy sellers. They were helping to promote a Royal British Legion effort to raise £1million for forces charities in a single day in the capital. Prince William seemed to enjoy his rare trip on the bus, saying: ‘It’s very sociable. Although I suppose everyone’s got their earphones in.’ Among their party was actress Barbara Windsor, who asked after baby George. Kate replied: ‘He’s half asleep,’ gesturing towards the apartment they share in the Palace. William added: ‘He’s behaving himself this morning.’ A slender-looking Kate chose a £345 red coat by LK Bennett for the occasion, to match the three poppies pinned on to the lapel. She was also sporting a slightly different hairstyle, parted in the middle rather than to one side. Teaching Kate? Prince Harry, 29, took lessons in a fixed-wing Slingsby Firefly aircraft in Hampshire in 2008 . Peter Middleton, left, flew Prince Philip in a 1966 tour of South America, while Prince Harry is an Apache pilot . According to sources Kate normally enhances her sleek hairstyle with an organic vegetable-based colour wash and subtle low lights at the Richard Ward salon in Chelsea. But yesterday a few grey hairs could be seen, perhaps suggesting that Kate has, like many breastfeeding women, decided not to dye or highlight her hair. The couple were mobbed as they arrived at the tube station yesterday morning. Lisa Durchstecher, 24, from Hanover, who had just arrived at the station to take a tour of Kensington Palace, said: ‘We came from Germany to see Kensington Palace. This is a dream come true. We were screaming.’ The Duchess of Cambridge met military personnel, staff and volunteers from the Royal British Legion yesterday . Prince William, seen here in an RAF Sea King helicopter, was until recently a search and rescue pilot . William, who left his operational role in the RAF two months ago for a ‘transitional year’ of royal duties mixed with charity projects, told wellwishers he was missing flying search and rescue helicopters but enjoying the young family’s more settled life in London. ‘It’s quite nice being in one place,’ he said. The couple also spoke to Serena Alexander, 58, from Hammersmith, west London, whose son, Marine Sam Alexander, was killed by an improved explosive device in Afghanistan in 2011. As fundraisers prepared to scramble aboard the Routemaster bus, Mrs Alexander remembered her son, who was awarded the Military Cross, saying: ‘He loved a party. He would have thought this bus was a really good idea.’ Unfortunately, Kate and William were unable to take the bus back to the Palace – the huge crowds at the station meant the couple had to jump in an official car instead. Peter Middleton served as an RAF fighter pilot who used the wing tips of his Mosquito warplane to divert deadly German 'doodlebug' flying bombs away from London. Kate was close to her grandfather, and after his death at the age of 90 in 201, she delayed the announcement of her engagement to Prince William by several days. Flying Officer Middleton was posted to the No 37 Service Flying School in Calgary in 1942, when he was a volunteer reservist aged just 22, and spent two-and-a-half years as an instructor, training Spitfire, Hurricane and Lancaster pilots. Brave pilot: Peter Middleton, centre, at his marriage to Valerie Glassborow, of Leeds, in 1946 - on the far left is the groom's brother Christopher Middleton and on the far right the bride's sister, Mary Glassborow . Later he became an unsung hero in the air war against Hitler's Luftwaffe, after joining the reservist 605 Squadron at Manston, near Ramsgate, Kent, in August 1944. Showing incredible courage, he was deployed in a de Havilland Mosquito fighter bomber to nudge the wings of unmanned German V1 flying missiles to divert them from London. The deadly 'doodlebugs', launched from France, could each destroy at least three houses. About 8,000 were launched at Britain and more than 2,000 hit London, killing thousands. Deadly: A V1 flying bomb, or doodlebug - Kate's pilot grandfather 'nudged' them away from London . Middleton was among a group of elite RAF 'top guns' used to push the V1s off-course. Despite risking his life on an almost nightly basis, it is not thought that he received an honour for his bravery. After being demobbed in 1946, Middleton flew Tridents with British European Airways, a forerunner of British Airways. And in 1962, he made the Middleton family's first direct royal connection when he acted as First Officer to the Duke of Edinburgh on a two-month flying tour of South America. Prince Philip piloted 49 of the tour's 62 flights, often with Middleton -- who had been specially chosen for the tour by BEA -- by his side. Middleton was later sent a letter of thanks and a pair of gold cufflinks from Buckingham Palace.","The Duchess of Cambridge said she was learning to fly fixed-wing planes .

Rikki Lea Mynott was jailed for four months after being convicted of two assaults, being drunk and disorderly and breaches of previous court orders . A feckless father has been banned from every single pub and club along an entire 13 mile stretch of coastland after going on a six year drinking binge funded by state handouts. Jobless Rikki-Lea Mynott, 25, terrorised police, bar staff, paramedics and the public after blowing his benefit money on marathon drinking sessions in Blackpool and other towns and villages bordering the Lancashire seaside resort. In the latest incident, Mynott got drunk again and was said to have behaved like a 'wild animal' biting a nightclub doorman before kicking a policewoman called to the scene to restrain him. In previous incidents he abused paramedics trying to help him after he was found collapsed and injured in a drunken stupor - and in another stormed round a taxi rank shouting: 'I’m going to kill someone.' Since November 2007 Mynot thas been a familiar figure at Blackpool magistrates court for his booze binges where he was given fines or supervision orders. He claimed to be getting treatment for his heavy drinking and vowed to go tee-total. But in a message posted on his Facebook page only last week he admitted: 'Hate remembering what I said - drunk last night.' and added: 'F***in (sic) defo lost my bank card.' Today Lancashire Police said Mynott, who has a young daughter, had been issued with a year long Drinking Banning Order barring him from all pubs and clubs in at at least 16 different towns and villages across the Fylde Coast. The order was imposed as he was jailed for four months after being convicted of two assaults, being drunk and disorderly and breaches of previous court orders. It means he is barred from buying, drinking or possessing alcohol in public and from entering certain establishments that serve alcohol. The year long Drinking Banning Order bars him from all pubs and clubs in at at least 16 different towns and villages across the Fylde Coast . The DBO will come into force once he is freed from jail. If he is caught inside a pub or club he faces a maximum fine of £2,500. Blackpool JP Mark Cowburn told him: 'We feel we have a duty to protect the people of Blackpool Fylde and Wyre. These offences you have committed and previous offences, show you are a dangerous individual.' Afterwards a pub boss in the area said: 'This man has been a total menace to bars and clubs up and down the coast. He is barred from buying, drinking or possessing alcohol in public and from entering certain establishments that serve alcohol . 'The problem is he gets barred from one premisis and then he simply goes to another - not even worrying about travelling from town to town. ‘What amazes us is how is able to aford his drinking. He’s supposed to be unemployed yet it seems he can gallivant around funding his life of drinking with his welfare handouts. It’s a disgrace.' Mynott was initially before the court in November 2007 for disorderly behaviour after he insisted on shouting and swearing in the street - despite pleas from officer for him to go home. A woman at a taxi rank was so concerned about Mynott’s behaviour she asked a police officer to stay with her until her cab arrived as he yelled: 'I’m going to kill someone.' At the time Mynott claimed he was angry because his girlfriend’s former boyfriend had allegedly beaten her up and insisted he was trying to stop drinking. But in June 2009 he was back in court after being seen staggering along the street with a pint glass full of beer. Although an officer grabbed the glass and poured the alcohol away, Mynott was allowed entry into a nightclub. At drinking up time, the same officer who had been keeping watch on Mynott told him to get rid of it, only for Mynott to start flailing his arms and push the officer. The following November Mynott was back in court again after he was drunkenly throwing punches in the air and threatened a group of people saying he was going 'to kick their heads in'. He promised again he was trying to sort his life out and had been on an alcohol rehabilitation course and said on the night of the offence he had a row with someone who owed him money. 'He's supposed to be unemployed yet it seems he can gallivant around funding his life of drinking with his welfare handouts'Pub landlord on Mynott . But in July this year he abused paramedics who were called to a street where he lay drunk and injured. The medics and police officers were trying to help him into the ambulance but he was so abusive he was arrested. Mynott claimed he had been to a party then fell over in the street banging his head and losing consciousness. But later police answering a report of men and women fighting on the beach near Central Pier found Mynott drunk again with cuts on his face. The latest incident occurred in the early hours of September 29 when police were called to the Loft nightclub in Lytham St Annes after Mynott was seen 'bouncing' around on the dance floor with a wine bottle in his hand. A doorman tried to eject him but he was bitten on the forearm. Police arrived and had to grapple with Mynott who was handcuffed and put in leg restraints and in the melee kicked a woman officer twice in the leg. In a separate incident, while on bail, Mynott drunkenly threw himself on the bonnet of a police car. In mitigation Mynott said he had problems with the police and people in authority after drinking. He was vowing to get more treatment for his alcohol problems. After the case Sgt Niamh O’Donoghue, of Blackpool Police’s Licensing Unit said: 'Mynott has assaulted two people for doing their jobs. The doorman was trying restore order in the nightclub by removing Mynott when he started being abusive to those around him. 'And then Mynott has assaulted an officer responding to Mynott’s assault of the doorman during the lawful execution of her duty. 'These actions are completely unacceptable, and we welcome the magistrates’ decision to imprison Mynott. As both of these assaults were fuelled by alcohol, we also sought a Drinking Banning Order. She added: 'We will continue to seek Drinking Banning Orders in a bid to reduce the amount of alcohol-fuelled offenders who are harming others, as they are a great way to protect the public and licensed says that he studied 'at the streets' and claimed to have money. His last post read: 'I’m getting mad that the people in the estate agents just keep saying they dont have any properties that will suit me - even though I got the cash to move in today.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 03:40 EST, 8 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:21 EST, 8 November 2013 . The water watchdog today blocked a huge eight per cent rise in Thames Water bills, telling the firm its demands for more money from customers was not justified. Ofwat flexed its regulatory muscle to block the increase, insisting an already-agreed rise of 1.4 per cent above inflation was sufficient. And as it urged companies to consider even freezing bills, comparisons were made with energy regulator Ofgem which is powerless to stop gas and electricity price hikes of up to 10 per cent. Vetoed: Thames Water wanted to impose an extra increase on bills of eight per cent, but regulator Ofwat said there was no evidence it was necessary . Thames Water applied to Ofwat in August to impose the larger than expected increase, which would add £29 to bills in 2014-15. The regulator ordered the firm to prove why the extra money was needed at a time when families are feeling the pinch, but it failed to do so. Ofwat's chief regulation officer Sonia Brown said: 'We said we would challenge Thames' application, in the interests of customers. 'We did just that and on the evidence provided we are not convinced that an extra bill increase is justified.' Thames Water could now launch an appeal against the decision. If unchallenged, Thames could still increase bills by 1.5 per cent above inflation from next April. Costs: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is to rush out action to limit water bill rises in an attempt to take back control of political debate over the cost of living . Water regulator Ofwat sets price rises for water firms every five years. In 2009 it agreed annual rises with all firms for 2010-15. If a firm wants to go beyond those rises, as Thames Water wanted to, Ofwat has the power to block it. However, the energy industry is less tightly-regulated. Gas and electricity firms can hike bills by as much as they like, with Ofgem powerless to intervene. In part this is because customers are able to switch suppliers, which they cannot do with water. Ofgem said it 'does not control the prices customers pay – this is down to energy suppliers'. 'We regulate the prices energy companies charge for transporting energy to your home through pipes and wires,' a spokesman added. 'Ofgem is working to make retail market competition more effective by introducing a range of reforms to make it easier for consumers to engage in the energy market. 'As well as reforms to create a level playing field so small suppliers can compete more effectively in the market.' It is a sign that Ofwat is preparing to go to battle with water firms ahead of the next round of negotiations over price rises for 2015-20 which start next month. The government has ordered Ofwat to ‘get under the skin’ of suppliers to ensure bills are . not increased simply to maximise profits. Thames had argued that since the planned rise was agreed in 2009 the company had 'experienced changes to certain specific costs that were not taken account of by Ofwat' at the time. Earlier this week water companies were urged by ministers to scrap planned hikes in bills to ease the pressure on family finances. The coalition has been under fire for their failure to prevent major rises in gas and electricity bills this winter by the Big Six firms who hiked prices by an average of 9.1 per cent. However, unlike the water industry Ofgem does not have the power to block big rises in energy bills. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has asked the industry to try to reduce costs – and will promise bill payers a ‘fair deal’ by writing to the companies to stress ‘the tough times that households are facing and the crucial role that the industry can play to bring costs down’. Household water bills are set by regulator Ofwat, and increased by 3.5 per cent for this year – or £13 – to an average of £388 beginning in April. Water firms are more heavily regulated than the energy industry, but Ofwat also believes costs could be reduced over the next five years to reflect efficiency savings and the low cost of borrowing. Mr Paterson said: ‘We know that household budgets are under pressure, and keeping water bills affordable is a crucial way we can help hardworking people. That is why we are pressing hard to make sure customers get a fair deal.’ Firms will be ‘encouraged’ to review planned price increases, and introduce more discounts for vulnerable customers known as ‘social tariffs’ – although this will remain voluntary. This and other measures are expected to help cut the soaring burden of bad debt - when people cannot pay their bills and they are saddled onto other customers to the tune of £15-£20 per household. Ofwat set guidelines for prices five years in advance and then tweaks them when inflation figures are published in November. They believe the next price review for 2015 to 2020 which is published next year could reduce bills by up to £750 million a year - or around £30 per household. Plea: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson asked the industry to try to reduce costs . Water minister Dan Rogerson said Ofwat is the ‘key player’ in driving down water bills. He said that as long as investment was not jeopardised ‘we don't want to see bills going up unnecessarily’. ‘That is now a matter for Ofwat to get under the skin of all the companies,’ he told the Western Morning News. Sonia Brown, chief regulation officer at Ofwat said last week that there are ‘real opportunities’ for companies to reduce bills partly due to low interest rates. She said any company that will not be reducing them should provide ‘clear evidence that this is backed by its customers’. It refused an application from Thames Water which supplies 8million customers in London, to increase bills by 8 per cent this year. In September, George Osborne water bills were on the cards to reduce the ‘burden on families’ as well as energy bills, the cost of housing, transport and fees for financial services. But Labour’s environment spokeswoman Maria Eagle said British households face some of the highest water bills in Europe - and two million now spend more than 5pc of their income on water. Water UK, representing the suppliers, said they were already working on social tariffs and tackling bad debt, while efficiency savings have saved customers around £120.","Ofwat says firm did not provide prove that £29 hike was needed .

As the latest series of Downton Abbey draws to a close, millions hang their heads in despair, envisaging months of emptiness until their beloved family of aristocrats return. But this time, all is not lost. Though the Crawley family and their servants are packing up a fourth series, viewers can now replace their upstairs-downstairs fix with a visit to the real-life manor. The set - Highclere Castle in Newbury, Berkshire - is home to the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon when the cameras clear off. But with fans clamouring for more, the family have decided to open their doors to share the space with the world. Magnificent: The 50-foot-tall main hall has acoustics ideal for performances from choirs or minstrel groups to entertain guests at Highclere in Newbury, West Berkshire . Party venue: Highclere, home to the Carnarvons since the 17th century, was the centre of 1800s political life. Benjamin Disraeli exclaimed 'How scenical!' when he visited . Visitors of the magnificent country house have free reign to explore the 1,000-acre grounds - from the grandiose entrance hall to the luxurious sitting room - that have been brought to life on their TV screen. The main hall's ceiling is 50 feet tall, providing perfect acoustics for performances from a choir or a group of minstrels to entertain the Carnarvons' many guests. Servants would have to throw themselves down makeshift chutes during fire alarms as the stairs were too many to run down. Priceless paintings lather the walls - including a portrait of Charles I, commissioned by the king himself, hanging in the dining room behind where Hugh Bonneville sits in the series as he plays Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham. The gold leaf-adorned sitting room - used in the show by Cora Crawley, the lady of the manor - glimmers with light pouring in through the windows onto Napoleon's desk, which sits discreetly in the corner. Hit: Downton Abbey has reigned in millions of viewers to ITV every Sunday night for four series as the aristocrats and servants cavort around Highclere Castle . History: The mansion was built by Sir Charles Barry, architect of the Palace of Westminster, in 1838 over a Georgian manor. It now spans more than 1,000 acres . Upstairs-Downstairs: Visitors will be able to examine everything from the grand staircases to priceless paintings or the servants' bells which have courted ITV viewers . From the epic to the minuscule, . visitors will get a glimpse into the fine details that come together to . create the timely programme. The . bells - lined up in a row downstairs to summon servants - are each . slightly different, though seemingly identical. With time, workers would . know exactly which room they were being summoned to without even . looking at the bells. Every book in the living room has been read and readers have left their own thoughts and perceptions scrawled along the pages. And in the cabinets, a plethora of high quality china stands on display. In the grounds, there is a monk garden, created during Henry VIII's battle with the church as a retreat for the bishops of Winchester - and gave the inspiration for the hit show's name. Originally a hill fort, Highclere dates back to the Iron Age and has housed people for around 1300 years, according to an early Anglo-Saxon census. Dancing: There are plenty of halls for banquets and dancing. According to Lady Carnarvon, the family now play games like charades in these quarters . Minute detail: The bedrooms - all 80 of them - each have their own design quirks, including cornice-moulded ceilings, gold leaf walls, or floor-to-floor windows . Many uses: During WWI, the manor was turned into a hospital for wounded soldiers in Flanders. The 5th Countess of Carnarvon, inspiration for Cora, nursed them herself . Lived in: Current owners, Earl Geordie and Countess Fiona, live in the manor most of the year with their son. They have photos all over of ancestors or them with royals . Documentation from the late 1700s show the first signs of the Carnarvon family, who started with some major rebuilding works. They converted the old brick and freestone house into a classical Georgian mansion. But a couple of decades later, they went a step further. In 1848, the third Earl of Carnarvon commissioned Sir Charles Barry, who built the Palace of Westminster, to transform his estate into a mansion. It was a project that would last 30 years and, once built, the manor became the centre of 19th century political life. On screen: The library makes for a dimly-lit setting for heart-wrenching talks as the characters wade through emotional battles and financial deals . Grand: Every exquisitely-bound book on the shelves has been read - with thoughts and perceptions left scrawled on the dusty pages . Gold: The columns of the library - like much of the castle - are decorated in gold. The Carnarvons have admitted they needed to get some parts repainted after filming . Peek inside: People can pay to see the entire castle, grounds and gardens with the top band ticket. Cheaper tickets - £5 - are offered for garden-only tours . House parties beckoned leading politicians, innovators, aviators, soldiers, and explorers. Benjamin Disraeli exclaimed 'How scenical! How scenical!' on first seeing the re-named and re-modelled 'Highclere Castle'. But the party venue would soon become a makeshift hospital as the First World War took over the nation. Patients began to arrive from Flanders . from September 1914 - and the 5th Countess of Carnarvon, Almina (the . inspiration for the character, Cora), nursed the wounded herself. The Abbey: The name for Julian Fellowes' show stems from the creation of a monk garden in the grounds during Henry VIII's battle with the church . Full: During filming, at least 90 crew members and the entire cast take over the manor, using every opulent room for their day-to-day work, including this drawing room . Inspired: Cora Crawley, the lady of the manor, is based on Almina Carnarvon, the 5th Countess who welcomed in soldiers and nursed them during WW2 . During the Second World War, a few evacuee children from north London were taken in, but by and large it returned to being a private home. The limelight then turned to the inhabitants: in 1923, the 5th Earl - a leading Egyptologist - rewrote history by discovering Tutankahmun's grave. His premature death six weeks later at the age of 56 shook the nation, filled headlines - and left the family in thousands of pounds of debt. But, like Matthew Crawley's death in Downton, the family struggled through and managed to keep hold of their grand home and out of the newspapers. Decoration: Crests adorn the walls of the saloon, which is a focal point of the show. Servants had to jump down chutes during fire alarms to escape the giant hall . Home: Geordie, the 8th Earl of Highclere Castle, pictured at his home (left), and wife Fiona (right). His great-grandfather, the 5th Earl, discovered Tutankhamun's grave . Almost 100 years later, Downton Abbey put Highclere on the map again. Fiona Carnarvon, now the 7th Countess of the manor, wrote a book about the history using their extensive archives. Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes, a close . friend of the Carnarvons', used it as both the inspiration and the . setting for his award-winning ITV drama. Four . series in, film crews and costume designers take over the castle for . months at a time, creating the heady world of butlers and balls and . upstairs-downstairs shenanigans presided over by Hugh Bonneville and . Dame Maggie Smith. Outdoors: The Earl of Grantham (played by Hugh Bonneville) is fond of a cricket match or drinks event on the lawn of the West Berkshire estate . ‘Initially . we thought it would be a bit of fun and might help our marketing,’ says . 49-year-old Lady Carnarvon. (After all, the house has ‘between 50 and 80’ bedrooms to maintain.) ‘We had no idea it would be so successful.’ She . and Geordie Carnarvon live at Highclere with their 14-year-old son Edward . (Earl Carnarvon also has two grown-up children from his first marriage) while . filming continues around them. But they share the national - and now, worldwide - obsession with the fictional family that inhabits their historic house on Sunday evenings. ‘We always sit down at 9 o’clock for Downton,’ says Lady Carnarvon. ‘It’s very odd seeing them on the television in a particular part of the castle when you’re sitting ten yards away.’ They will welcome visitors into their home from December, offering tickets from £5 to £55 for a tour of the notorious grounds.","People can buy tickets to have a tour of Highclere Castle in Newbury, Berkshire, which was built in 1838 .

Bird Tilly - who was given a girl's name by his owners who originally thought he was female - lost half his beak when he was just six months old after accidentally chomping on barbed wire. The seven-year-old goose had been using his tongue to replace the missing part of the beak following the accident. But after Tilly's beak began to deteriorate, Mr Siddons, from Burley, North Yorkshire, stepped in and used his dental skills to patch it up crafting a prosthetic beak out of materials normally used for false teeth. Scroll down for video . Beaky blinder: Veterinary surgeon Andy MacGregor was able to craft the prosthetic bill using denture materials, sparing the lucky bird from being put down . Tilly's owner Frances Hall-Coetzer from Gargrave, North Yorkshire, who says she has a special bond with her bird, sought help when Tilly's tongue became sore and more of his beak started falling away. She was initially told her beloved goose would probably have to be put down so she sought a second opinion with local vet Andy MacGregor, from Ashlands Vets in Ilkley, West Yorkshire. Mr MacGregor created a temporary fix for Tilly using dental resin and orthopaedic screws which allowed him to start eating and drinking normally. Before and after: The painful looking injury (right) caused by barbed wire left Tilly unable to eat properly. Thanks to the new prosthetic, she's back on flying form . He then called his dentist friend Chris Siddons of The Burley Dental Suite, in nearby Wharfedale. He put Tilly under general anesthetic and took some silicone impressions of his beak using dental materials. A technician was able to cast the impressions to produce a study model which was used as a template to make the new beak. Mr Siddons used a material called cold cured dental acrylic, which is the same substance used for creating human dentures. The dental practitioner said it was the first time he had treated a goose in his 20 years in the job. He said: 'The vet is a very good friend of mine, and when I got the phone call I thought it was a joke to start with. Have a gander: Staff at the Ashland's veterinary practice have grown quite fond of their new feathered friend . 'I've helped before dealing with root fillings for dogs, but this is the first time ever I have operated on a goose. 'This sort of operation is fairly rare and it's quite rare for the animal to survive.' Fitting the beak took around an hour. Anne MacGregor, practice manager at the vets, told how the procedure should have cost £100 but was done for free as the surgery had never seen anything like Tilly’s condition before. She said: 'Tilly came in with his beak hanging apart. He was managing to eat and maintain his weight by using his tongue, but it was dried out due to overusing it. 'It took just 45 minutes to fix on Tilly’s new beak and we’re looking to send him home for the future soon. This is a very rare operation and something which I don’t think we’ll ever see in this vets again. 'Everyone has done a fantastic job and thankfully Tilly is doing really well now.' Send me the bill: The newly patched up Tilly happily strolls around the farm in North Yorkshire . Mrs Hall-Coetzer  said: 'When he was six months old, I took him to a farm but he suffered an accident whilst he was there. 'I took him to the vets near to where I live, but they said they couldn't do anything about it. 'He had bitten on some barbed wire, and as time had gone by more of his beak had been pulled away and he used his tongue to compensate that. 'His tongue became quite sore and hard so three weeks ago I took him to Ashland's, who said they may be able to help.' Thanks: Andy MacGregor from the veterinary surgery admires his work . She added: 'Tilly is really special and incredibly tame, I just thought I had to to what I could. 'It's amazing how he's managed to survive seven years with this, but after I spotted his tongue dropping, I knew something drastic had to be done. 'Without the vets at Ashland's, Tilly wouldn't be alive now and I'm so grateful for what they have done. 'I don't have any children and he is my life, we have a special bond and I'm so glad he's been saved.'

The tweet, from the company's official @HomeDepot account, showed a picture of two African-American drummers with a person in a gorilla mask in between them and asked: 'Which drummer is not like the others?' It was quickly pulled, but not before people took screen shots of it and it was widely circulated on social media. NBC and CNBC, among others, reported on the Tweet.

Five men have been convicted of child abuse after exploiting the 'profound vulnerability' of a 15-year-old girl, it emerged today. The victim, who was removed from her drug-addicted parents and taken into care at a young age, took the stand in two trials to give evidence against her abusers. She told the court that the defendants plied her with vodka and cannabis before having sex with her. The abuse take place in 2008 and 2009 in Rochdale, and first came to light after the girl complained to police that Congolese refugee Freddie Kendakumana had raped her. Guilty: Chola Chansa, left, and Abdul Huk, right, are two of five men convicted of abusing a teenage girl . She had been prompted to talk to officers after telling a health support worker that Kendakumana had been forcing himself upon her. However, other social workers failed to report her claims that she was having consensual sexual contact with a string of older men whom she labelled 'boyfriends'. It was not until last year, four years after the initial complaint, that the defendants were finally charged. Last month Kendakumana, 27, was convicted of rape and sexual activity with a child. He was cleared of a second count of rape. Two other men, Mohammed Rafiq Abubaker, 25, and takeaway worker Roheez Khan, 27, were found guilty of sexual activity with a child. Khan was also convicted of witness intimidation. A fourth man, 33-year-old Chola Chansa, pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a child just before the trial started. Abuse: Freddie Kendakumana, left, and Mohammed Rafiq Abubaker, right, were also convicted . In another trial which concluded today taxi driver Abdul Huk, 37, was found guilty of sexual activity with a child. Two more defendants were cleared of all charges, while the jury was unable to reach a verdict on another man. The five men convicted in the two trials will be sentenced on December 20 at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court. Judge Jonathan Foster QC removed reporting restrictions on the case following the end of the second trial. This is the second major child abuse case in Rochdale in the past 18 months, after nine men of Pakistani origin were jailed for the systematic grooming and sexual abuse of five white girls in May last year. Dozens more potential victims of child sexual abuse have been identified in Rochdale by Greater Manchester Police. Opening the case against all the defendants, prosecutor Neil Usher said: 'Leading the chaotic life that [the victim] had for some time by the age of 15, she was vulnerable to being groomed and exploited by those who correctly perceived she would be easy to flatter and impress with free and plentiful drink, cannabis and just as importantly, a level of attention and affection that she craved and felt she had lacked in her difficult early life. 'She repeatedly and regularly returned to a number of older men all of whom sexually exploited her and some of whom physically abused her, despite her being advised and supported by health care and social workers. 'The risk-taking and potentially harming positions she regularly put herself in was an indication of the extent of her profound vulnerablily and emotional immaturity.' Taking advantage: Huk and Chansa, along with others, gave the girl alcohol and drugs before abusing her . In 2008 the girl, now aged 20, was a troubled teenager who had been taken into care by Social Services at an early age following a chaotic upbringing by her drug-addicted parents, he said. She was later returned to her mother after a stint in foster care but began drinking alcohol, taking crack cocaine and sniffing lighter fluid from the age of 11. The girl was in touch with a number of agencies including Pennine Care Foundation Trust's Crisis Intervention Team which deals with sexual health and Early Break, an organisation which focuses on substance misuse problems. The prosecutor said she would tell those agency support workers and her social workers from Rochdale Council about the lifestyle she was leading. She claimed that older men would give her copious amounts of alcohol, sometimes drugs, and she would have consensual sex with them. The court heard that the girl realised shortly before her 16th birthday that her torrid lifestyle had to end and she later cut her ties with older men and enrolled at college. As she testified in the two trials the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, provided chilling details of how her 'boyfriends' would abuse her. Speaking calmly, she described one occasion when Kendakumana dragged her by her hair as she was trying to leave his flat. 'He slapped me across the face for no reason,' she told the court. 'I said, ""Why?"" He said, ""I felt like it.""' She added: 'He kept saying he wants a baby with me. At first I thought maybe I should but I changed my mind.' In a police interview, she said that Khan was 'controlling' and violent when she was seeing him. 'He kept ringing and ringing me, asking me to come out,' she said. 'Having a drink one night, I ended up sleeping with him. Started going out with him but it got too much. 'He got controlling, he said, ""Don't go to school."" He said we will get married and live abroad.' She added that he threatened her when she attempted to end their relationship. 'He said if you finish I'm going to smash your windows, plant drugs in your house and kidnap you and your mum. My windows got put through.' Giving evidence at the first trial, she told the court that various men would invite her to their flats around Rochdale and ply her with spirits. 'They would say they were my boyfriend but they were not really,' she said. 'But at the time I thought that was what a relationship was.'","Freddie Kendakuman, Mohammed Rafiq Abubaker, Roheez Khan, Chola Chansa and Abdul Huk all convicted of child sex abuse .

This is what 1kg (2.2lb) of high-purity cocaine looks like, seized by police as the criminals that smuggled it into Britain are jailed for a total of 23 years. The highly-addictive stimulant was found in the kitchen of a house in Ludworth, County Durham, next to weighing scales and latex gloves as the criminals prepared to sell it. After being cut with other powders like baking soda, caffeine, or powdered milk to increase its weight, the group would have used the highly precise scales to divide the drugs into small plastic bags or paper wraps ready to be sold on the street. Illegal: 1kg of high-purity cocaine waiting to be cut using latex gloves and high sensitivity scales before being sold onto the streets in North East England . David Thompson, 28, from North Shields, was jailed alongside brothers Robert Hall, 40, and Thomas Hall, 35, after all three admitted conspiracy to supply class A and B drugs between January 2012 and May this year. Another 2.5kg (5.5lb) of cocaine was found at the same address, worth a total of £644,000, alongside 380 nine-ounce bars of cannabis resin, worth £402,000. In a 'stash house' police found a further 27kg (60lb) of cannabis with Thompson's finger prints on. The bars would either be sold whole or broken up into smaller lumps and sold as hashish, commonly known as hash. Hashish is made from the resin of the female cannabis plant which is extracted by grinding up the leaves before pressing them into a hard block. Users then heat the drug, causing it to break apart, before mixing it with tobacco and rolling it into a cigarette, or smoking it in a pipe. Alongside the cocaine police found 380 nine-ounce bars of cannabis resin worth around £402,000 . As with cocaine, unscrupulous dealers have been known to spray the plants with sand in order to increase their weight, and in 2008 around 30 people in Germany were poisoned after criminals mixed the class B drug with lead in order to make more profit. Cocaine is usually broken down into 1gram wraps which sell for around £50, but statistics from the UK Forensic Science Service have shown purity levels dropping to new lows, with a up to a third of cocaine seized containing less than 9 per cent of the substance. Heavy cannabis use is linked with developing schizophrenia in later life, and if mixed with tobacco can cause lung damage and cancer, especially as it is usually smoked unfiltered to increase its effects. Robert Hall (left), was sentenced to 13 years after he was found to be the head of the gang, while his brother Thomas Hall (right) was given six years behind bars . Cocaine has been linked with heart disease, with even moderate use leading to thickening of the heart muscles and major arteries leading to increase risk of heart attack and stroke, according to research. David Thompson, 28, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail . Heavy use can also lead to paranoia, anxiety and panic attacks, and also wears away the cartilage in the middle of the nose, as with former EastEnders star Daniella Westbrook. The gang were caught despite using a mixture of 'clean' and 'dirty' mobile phones to set up meetings and avoid detection. Jailing the trio, Recorder Michael Slater said: 'I’m . satisfied from what I’ve heard that this was a well-organised, extensive . and expertly put together drug-dealing operation supplying both cannabis . and cocaine to the North East and beyond. 'The rewards were extremely . high, hence the amounts of drugs being supplied and the amount of money . that was floating around. 'In the course of this ‘snap-shot’ of the operation, cannabis and cocaine with a total street value of £1m was recovered.' As the head of the gang, Robert Hall was jailed for 13 years, while his brother, Thomas, was jailed for six years and Thompson was given four and a half years. The owner of . the house the drugs were found in, Peter Samuel Davies, 65, and his newphew, Wayne Robson, 41, were . jailed previously for five and seven years respectively for conspiracy . to supply class A and B drugs. Robert Hall, a father from Easington, was accused of using his paving company as a front for the drug enterprise, while Thompson, also a father, said he was using drug dealing as a way to better his family. The gang are thought to have imported the drugs from Europe, though the cannabis is likely to have originated in North Africa or the Middle East, while cocaine is often smuggled from South America through Africa and into the UK. Looks like: Tightly packed green leaves called 'buds', hard brown resin, or occasionally in oil form . Costs: Most commonly sold as 1/8 of an ounce for £20 . Used: Can be rolled with tobacco and smoked, put into a pipe, vaporised with special equipment and inhaled or cooked into food and eaten . Effects: feeling of relaxation, drowsiness and happiness, often accompanied with fits of laughter. Also a strong urge to eat, often known as the 'munchies'. Risks: schizophrenia, especially in those either already diagnosed with, or at risk from the condition. Lung cancer associated with smoking, a lack of motivation, and insomnia when use stops. Looks like: White power . Costs: Typically £50 per gram, though as much as £90 for higher purity . Used: Usually snorted in lines, though can also be rolled and smoked. Effects: Body high or 'buzz', feeling of alertness, mental clarity, and increased social skills. Risks: Heart attack, seizure and stroke brought on by raised heart rate and thickening of heart muscle with repeated use. Also causes paranoia, anxiety or panic attacks. Often mixed with other potentially harmful substances which can be impossible to identify in the event of an overdose.","Around 1kg of high-purity cocaine found in a kitchen .

The family of a young father have revealed their heartache as he serves a life sentence - for stealing a power tool. Patrick W. Matthews was jailed in . 2009 at the age of 22, for stealing a $750 welding machine, some . tools and a generator, according to court documents. Matthews, who has a history of drug abuse, was sentenced to life in a Louisiana prison for his crimes. His case has come to light after a report was released this week by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which shows the shocking number of non-violent offenders who are facing the rest of their lives in jail for relatively small-time offenses. Patrick Matthews with his family, pictured with his young children Blayton and Hayley, was jailed for life in 2009 in Louisiana for stealing a power-tool. Matthews, now 25, is serving a life term for his crime . Matthews, who had been using meth and heroin since he was a teenager, was sentenced under Louisiana's Habitual Offender law. The harsh sentence came because the young man had prior convictions - one for stealing from a pawn shop and another from a fruit stand while he was a teenager and high on meth. Matthews had never spent a day in jail before he was sentenced to a life term. The father, who has a son Blayton, eight, and six-year-old daughter Hayley, told the ACLU: 'I never in the world would've . thought that could happen. 'Made one mistake . and was treated like a murderer.' His mother Catherine Matthews said that her son's jail time was tantamount to a death sentence. She also told the ACLU: 'To . see your child get life without parole at 22 years old has to be the . most gut-wrenching feeling that you could ever feel. 'Because it's like giving him a death sentence. Because there's no life - no life for a man, with his children or his parents, or anybody else . once they're in there.' His appeal against the harsh sentence at the Louisiana State court was rejected in 2010. Matthews, pictured with his mother Catherine and his son, had never spent a day in prison before he was jailed for life . His defense said the crimes were property thefts committed by a drug addict. But the judge did not agree, saying that the defendant's crimes had left the victims 'distraught' and that 'downward departures' from mandatory minimums should rarely be made. The ACLU investigation reveals 3,278 people are incarcerated in the U.S. for minor offenses and 65 per cent of the inmates are black. Among other offenses that have led to life terms are stealing a $159 jacket, carrying drugs for an abusive boyfriend and having someone hide illegal substances in your home. The cost of keeping these inmates behind bars runs into millions for the taxpayer.","Patrick W. Matthews was jailed in .

A new life: Five-year-old Skyler Burns looks every inch a happy and beautiful little girl . According to Mr and Mrs Burns they knew Skyler was different to their four other sons when she began playing with toys designed for girls and refused to use the men's toilets. But they became concerned when they found her crying after Mrs Burns handed out boy-themed invitations for his fourth party. 'One of his pets had died that week and we gave him a little burial in the garden', Mrs Burns told 9News. 'He was curled up in the foetal position sobbing... and he told me from under the bed that he'd rather be dead like his pet in the garden than be a boy', he told A Current Affair. Parents Summer and Brett have now made the decision to allow their child to live her life as a girl . His parents decided to take him to see a GP as well as specialists and after months of appointments, Skyler was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. She will have to take medication to block puberty when she is 11 and if she decides to carry on with her decision, Skyler will be given oestrogen and can have surgery. Mrs Burns added: 'It's hard to put a dress on your son and send him off into the world but in the end it's her happiness.' Difficult decision: Skyler was born a boy called Seth but says she wants to live her life as a girl . Psychologist Linda Madalin said her parents have made the right decision. She said: 'If this is what the child needs for her physiological wellbeing then that is more important than what other people think. Next year Skyler will start school as a girl and is looking forward to wearing a dress. Gender dysphoria is a condition in which a person feels that there is a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity. Biological sex is assigned at birth, depending on the appearance of the infant. Gender identity is the gender that a person 'identifies' with, or feels themselves to be. For example, a person may have the anatomy of a man, but gender identify as a woman. Others do not describe themselves as either male or female, or may describe themselves as agender. This mismatch can cause feelings of discomfort that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate.","Skyler was born a boy and has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria .

Jose Matada, from Mozambique, fell to his death from the undercarriage of an aeroplane ten miles from Heathrow . Detectives have identified the man whose body fell onto a suburban London road from the under carriage of a plane flying to Heathrow last year. José Matada, 30, from Mozambique, was found in Portman Avenue, Mortlake, in September but the Metropolitan Police struggled to identify him. Detectives analysed a SIM card found in his jeans and contacted the phone numbers that were stored on it. They were able to extract and contact telephone numbers from the card as part of the 'complex inquiry'. They had originally thought he was Angolan because of currency found in his pockets and the fact that a flight from Luanda, Angola, had passed over shortly before the body was found. However, he was not a member of air crew or a passenger. Officers are now working with authorities in Mozambique to try to find his next of kin. An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned. A Scotland Yard spokesman said they are 'satisfied' the man is Mr Matada and said they had been able to identify him as 'new information has recently come to light'. In December, police released images of the man in a bid to identify him. His body was found shortly in the suburban road, ten miles from the airport, before 8am on September 9. A post mortem held at Kingston Hospital Mortuary gave the cause of death as multiple injuries. Aviation experts said at the time that the man was probably . dead before he hit the ground either because he had been crushed by the . retracting landing gear shortly after the plane took off, or because of . the extreme cold at high altitude. Detectives initially believed Mr Matada was from Angola as he had the country's currency on him when he was found in the street in Mortlake, pictured . One resident said in September: ‘It is unbelievable. The first thing I thought when I saw the body was that it must have fallen from quite a height.' Mr . Matada was wearing jeans, a grey hoody and white trainers when he fell, . and had a tattoo on his left arm of a distinctive emblem with the . letters ' Z ' and 'G ' clearly visible.

Authority spokesman said a stowaway in an aircraft undercarriage was . unlikely to survive as he would either be crushed by the wheels after . take-off . or freeze in temperatures as low as minus 40C (minus 40F). He said last year: ‘The chances of survival for a stowaway are very slim, particularly in the recess of the landing gear. ‘I don’t know of anyone who has survived being stowed away on a long-haul flight. ‘When the landing gear comes down at . the other end, a few miles from the runway and about 2,000ft in the air, . if there is a person who had died they would fall out.’ Aviation experts say Mr Matada was probably dead before he hit the ground either from cold or from being crushed by the wheels after take off (file picture)","Scotland Yard named the man as José Matada after a long inquiry .

Worrying: Experts hit back at figures showing GP funds have dropped to 8.4 per cent of the budget . Patient care is being put at risk as the amount of NHS budget being spent on general practice is now the lowest on record, experts warn. Just 8.4 per cent of the service's allowance is put into doctors' surgeries - down from 10.3 per cent in 2005. This is despite the fact that more than 90 per cent of the service's care is through doctors' surgeries. It is a worrying change that could have a dramatic impact on waiting times, forcing patients into overcrowded accident and emergency wards, the Royal College of General Practitioners warned. In a study with the National Association for Patient Participation, the RCGP attacked the leaders of the NHS for sending mixed messages about their priorities. Polls carried out for the RCGP over the summer found 70 per cent of GPs fear waiting times will worsen over the next two years. At least 80 per cent said they no longer had resources to provide high-level patient care and 47 per cent said they have had to withdraw some patient services. Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the RCGP,  said: 'During the last nine years, GPs across the country have had to cope with a growing and an ageing population, in which more and more people have been affected by multiple, serious long-term conditions - and yet funding for general practice has been slashed. 'On the one hand, the people who run the NHS across the UK say they want more people to be cared for in the community. On the other, resources have relentlessly drifted away from community-based health services towards more expensive hospital-based care. 'The flow of funding away from general practice has been contrary to the rhetoric and has happened in the absence of any overall strategy as to how we spend the NHS budget. 'The share of the NHS budget spent on general practice has slumped to the lowest point on record. Fear: Royal College of General Practitioners found 70 per cent of GPs fear waiting times will dramatically worsen . Cutting queues: The RCGP claims low funds for general practices will worsen the already crippled A&E queues . 'The various NHS bodies and governments who decide how we divide the NHS funding cake in the UK have inadvertently allowed a situation to develop in which funding for general practice is being steadily eroded. With services now at breaking point, it's time to come up with a plan to turn the tide.' The RCGP and NAPP are launching a new campaign, Put Patients First, Back General Practice, calling on the Government to increase NHS spending on general practice across the UK to 11 per cent by 2017. They claim the campaign could enable GPs to offer shorter waiting times for appointments, more flexible opening hours and more online services. Dr Baker said: 'We need to increase our investment in general practice as a matter of urgency, so that we can take the pressure off our hospitals, where medical provision is more expensive, and ensure that more people can receive care where they say they want it - in the community.'","8.4% of budget is given to doctors' surgeries, which provides 90% of care .

Star: Katherine Jenkins has hit back at her critics by revealing her down-to-earth nature, and her yearning to start a family . She has been branded ruthlessly ambitious and a prima donna. But now Katherine Jenkins has hit  back at her critics by revealing her down-to-earth nature – and her yearning to start a family. In a candid interview with The Mail on Sunday, the 33-year-old superstar talks of her struggle  with the dark side of fame, and how her favourite gig of the year is a Christmas singalong with her family in a South Wales pub. The mezzo-soprano, who has just returned from a tour of China to prepare for a festive performance at London’s Royal Albert Hall, said the highlight of her year is returning to her mother’s house at Christmas. Jenkins also disclosed that she hopes to take a break soon to have children. ‘At some point in the next couple of years I’d like to have a family and hopefully be able to combine that with my music,’ she said. ‘That’s something that I really hope will happen. I might have to cut back on the travelling, for a couple of years anyway.’ The singer was less forthcoming about who the father of her children may be, but she remains close to Prince Harry’s stockbroker friend Adam Bidwell, whom she reportedly began dating in March. She was keen, however, to stress that despite leading a glamorous lifestyle, she has never been comfortable with all the attention. One example of the type of scrutiny she faces came when commentators criticised her for wearing make-up while running the London Marathon this year in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support – despite the fact she raised £26,000 in memory of her father, who died of lung cancer when she was 15. ‘I would say that by nature I’m a sensitive person, and I certainly didn’t come into this for fame,’ she said. ‘I wanted to be a classical singer and when I was training to do this, classical singers weren’t celebrities, so I really just wanted to sing. ‘I wasn’t looking to be famous or to be photographed leaving a restaurant – that never occurred to me. So dealing with this kind of career path where people have got a perception of you that sometimes couldn’t be further from the truth is weird. It can be odd and sometimes it’s upsetting. ‘Fortunately my mum is amazing, and she will say, “Don’t worry, we all know the truth, come back to Wales and I’ll give you a cutch” – that’s Welsh for a cuddle!’ Romantic Link: Katherine is said to be dating Adam Bidwell, second from left, who is a friend of Prince Harry . Last year Jenkins was dogged by claims . that she was determined to ‘crack’ America when she appeared on Dancing . With The Stars, the US version of Strictly. But she explained that she . received an invitation to participate out of the blue and took it . because it came during a difficult time in her personal life. ‘It wasn’t the big masterplan that everybody thought it was,’ she said. ‘I read people saying I was trying to conquer America, and that I’d set this up months in advance – but they approached me in the middle of February and by the end of that month I was flying out there. Good cause: Katherine raised £26,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support by running the London Marathon this year . Dancing Queen: Last year Jenkins was dogged by claims that she was determined to 'crack' America when she appeared on Dancing With The Stars, the US version of Strictly, where she partnered dancer Mark Ballas . ‘I was in a strange personal place at the time, and I thought, “I really fancy going away”.’ The upcoming Christmas break will be a rare treat for Jenkins, who has spent most of the year travelling the globe, most recently performing in the Middle East with tenor José Carreras. She gets excited as she talks of heading home to Neath: ‘We go out on Christmas Eve to a local bar with my aunties and uncles and mum. Our friends have a band and they perform, so I’ll get up and sing Delilah with them. It’s just as much fun as singing with Carreras.’ Katherine Jenkins performs  at the Royal Albert Hall,  London, on December 9.  For more information, visit royalalberthall.com.","Superstar, 33, reveals her yearning to take a break to have children .

Mothers having trouble breastfeeding may be showing the early signs of diabetes, doctors have warned. New research has revealed the hormone insulin plays an important part in the production of breast milk - and mothers who are struggling with feeding may have low levels of insulin. For a long time, insulin was not thought to play a direct role in regulating the milk-making cells of the human breast. But scientists now know that the mammary gland in breast becomes sensitive to insulin during lactation. New research has revealed that insulin plays an important part in the production of milk. For a long time, insulin was not thought to play a direct role in regulating the milk-making cells of the human breast. But scientists now know that the mammary gland becomes sensitive to insulin during lactation . A clinical trial is now planned with a drug used to control type 2 diabetes to determine whether it improves milk supply - and the researchers suggest that women struggling to breastfeed should perhaps get their insulin levels checked. Insulin levels are linked to diabetes. In people with type 1 diabetes, beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed, meaning that the body can no longer produce insulin. People with type 2 diabetes make insulin, but their bodies don’t respond well to it. Some people with type 2 diabetes may take pills or insulin shots to help their bodies use glucose for energy. Previous research from Dr . Laurie Nommsen-Rivers, the study author, have shown it takes longer for milk to come in to . women whose bodies struggle to metabolise enough insulin. Dr Laurie Nommsen-Rivers explored the connection between milk production and insulin levels, (an insulin pen is pictured) Those who tend to struggle often have factors involved such as being . overweight, being at an advanced maternal age, or having a large . birth-weight baby. Dr Nommsen-Rivers and her colleagues . were able to use a non-invasive method to capture mammary gland RNA - a . chain of molecules that are blueprints for making specified proteins - . in samples of human breast milk. They . then created the first publicly accessible library of genes expressed . in the mammary gland based on RNA-sequencing technology. They discovered an orchestrated . switching on and off of various genes as the mammary gland transitions . from secreting small amounts of immunity-boosting colostrum in the first . days after giving birth to the copious production of milk in mature . lactation. Having . identified the significance of insulin signalling in the production of . breast-milk, the scientists at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical . Centre and the University of California Davis, are now planning a . clinical trial with a drug used to control type two diabetes to . determine whether it improves insulin action in the mammary gland, thus . improving milk supply. Dr Nommsen-Rivers said: 'Considering . that 20 per cent of women between 20 and 44 are pre-diabetic, it’s . conceivable that up to 20 per cent of new mothers in the United States . are at risk for low milk supply due to insulin dysregulation [i.e. low . levels],' she said. While a drug is not an ideal way to solve the problem according to Dr Nommsen-Rivers, it is a way to establish proof-of-concept. 'The ideal approach is a preventive one,' she said. 'Modifications in diet and exercise are more powerful than any drug. After this clinical trial, we hope to study those interventions.'

He was also a pioneer in the use of the Picturesque in the design of buildings and their layout which can be seen in Ravensworth Castle, County Durham, Cronk-hill, Shropshire, or Regent's Park. His most famous designs are the Royal Pavilion, Brighton, and Buckingham Palace - although the facade to the mall is not Nash's work. He trained under Sir Robert Taylor and his marriage to a mistress of the future George IV introduced him to court circles which meant he could benefit from royal patronage.

The Florida State Boxing Commission has been reviewing Fox's license to determine whether she'll be able to keep fighting against women in the CFA's female tournament. Mitrone, who played defensive line in the NFL with the Giants in 2002 and the Vikings in 2005 before switching to fighting, called her a liar because Fox failed to flag up that she was transgender to the commission or her opponents before entering the ring. She has, however, been cleared to fight, the New York Post reported. 'That is a lying, sick, sociopathic, disgusting freak,' Mitrione said on the program. 'And I mean that. Because you lied on your license to beat up women. That's disgusting. You should be embarrassed yourself. And the fact that Florida licensed him because California licensed him or whoever the hell did it, it's an embarrassment to us as fighters, as a sport, and we all should protest that.

In the midst of the tirade, the show's host Ariel Helwani questioned why Mitrione kept calling Fox a 'he.' 'She's not a he. He's a he,' Mitrione argued. 'He's chromosomally a man. He had a gender change, not a sex change. He's still a man. He was a man for 31 years. Thirty-one years. That's a couple years younger than I am. He's a man. Six years of taking performance de-hancing drugs, you think is going to change all that? That's ridiculous.' It took the UFC a matter of hours before they suspended Mitrione until further notice claiming they were 'appalled by the transphobic comments' that were 'offensive and wholly unacceptable.'

Iran’s new president has called on Israel to join an international treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons, chiding the Jewish state for being the only Middle East nation that has failed to do so. The speech by President Hassan Rouhani came hours before a meeting that was to mark the highest-level direct contact in six years between the United States and Iran over Tehran’s disputed nuclear activities. 'Almost four decades of international efforts to establish a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East have regrettably failed,' Mr Rouhani told a United Nations meeting on nuclear disarmament on the sidelines of the General Assembly. Scroll down for videos . President Rouhani has called on Israel to join an international treaty, banning the spread of nuclear weapons . Rouhani faces a backlash in his country after seeming to concede that the holocaust happened in a TV interview, after eight years of denials from former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Israel is the only Middle East nation that has not signed the landmark 1979 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and Mr Rouhani said that has prevented the region from establishing a nuclear-free zone. It has never commented on suggestions it possesses a nuclear arsenal. 'No nation should possess nuclear weapons, since there are no right hands for these wrong weapons,' Mr Rouhani said. He was speaking on behalf of the Non-aligned Movement, which represents dozens of mostly developing countries. Mr Rouhani also said all nations should be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency inspections and other nuclear safeguards. Increased transparency, including more inspections, is a key part of the negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only, and says it needs to enrich uranium to produce reactor fuel and for medical purposes. But world powers fear Iran is enriching uranium to build warheads, and has imposed strict sanctions to punish Tehran to failing to halt its nuclear programme. In his debut on the world stage this week following his June election, Mr Rouhani and his government have shown urgency to revive the stalled nuclear negotiations and ease crippling international sanctions. A meeting later last night was aimed at paving the way for the first round of substantive negotiations on the nuclear issue since April. The United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany will participate, with European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton serving as host of the meeting with Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. Amir Hekmati, a joint U.S. Iranian citizen, has been in prison in Iran since 2011 after being convicted of spying . It came after Mr Rouhani said a deal over Iran's nuclear weapons should be struck with the US within three months. Speaking ahead of a landmark UN meeting between Iran and six world powers, he said Tehran wants a quick resolution to the nuclear issue. Mr Rouhani told the Washington Post: 'The only way forward is for a timeline to be inserted into the negotiations that's short–and wrap it up. 'That is a decision of my government, that short is necessary to settle the nuclear file. 'The shorter it is the more beneficial it is to everyone. If it's three months that would be Iran's choice, if it's six months that's still good. It's a question of months not years.' The apparent thawing of relations between America and Iran in recent weeks has seen Rouhani apparently admit that the holocaust happened in an interview broadcast on CNN. Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spent years denying the holocaust as part of his rhetoric against the Jewish state of Israel, one of America's strongest Middle Eastern allies. While the new President would not be drawn on the scale or numbers invovled, he is now facing a backlash at home after a conservative news agency accused CNN of wrongly translating the remark. The improvement in relations between Iran and the West has also prompted the father of an imprisoned former U.S. Marine to beg for his son's release. Hekmati (pictured left), a former U.S. Marine, claims he was visiting the Islamic state to see his grandmother . Hekmati's father, Ali, says he has a brain tumour and wants to see his son 'one more time'. Right is a picture of Amir taken from Facebook in which he is said to be wearing a headdress for a Halloween party . Ali Hekmati is asking Rouhani to order the release of his son, Amir, as Ali is now suffering with a brain tumour and may not have long to live. In a letter, the ailing father says: 'I long more than ever to see Amir's face. I am now very sick. 'I ask that you let me see him again, one more time, and so that he may lead our family when I am gone. 'Amir is a good man. An honorable man. He is not a spy, I can assure you of that.' Amir Hekmati, who has dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, was arrested in Iran in 2011. The family claim he was visiting his grandmother but the Islamic state accused him of being a CIA spy and convicted him. A short while later a video was released showing Amir 'confessing' to his crimes. Amir's father has reason to be hopeful after Iran freed dozens of political prisoners last week, just as Rouhani was headed to New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Earlier this month, Amir wrote a letter to US Secretary of Sate John Kerry describing his 'miserable prison conditions' and his belief that Tehran wanted to use him in a possible prisoner exchange. Hekmati's letter was smuggled out of prison and his sister authenticated the handwriting. The State Department said it was trying to determine Hekmati's condition through Swiss diplomats in Tehran. The Swiss represent U.S. interests in Iran because no U.S. officials are based there. The two countries severed diplomatic relations in 1979. Two other American citizens are believed to be detained in Iran: Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini. The release of prisoners and the softening on nuclear talks are part of a fresh charm offensive by Iran following years of icy relations under the former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As a condition of any deal Iran has said it will agree to international inspections along the lines of those between 2003 and 2005 and has not ruled out a meeting with Barack Obama. Rouhani added: 'If Mr Obama and I were to get together, we would both be looking at the . future, and the prospects ahead and our hopes for that future. 'The notes and . letters and exchanges between us are in that direction, and they will . continue. We need a beginning point. I think that is the nuclear issue.'","Hassan Rouhani has chided the Jewish state for not joining treaty .

Hopi High School senior Charles Youvella died of a traumatic brain injury while in hospital, the Arizona Interscholastic Association said. He was injured on Saturday in Hopi's 60-6 loss to Arizona Lutheran, in a first-round playoff game. Charles Youvella died of a traumatic brain injury after Saturday night's football game in Arizona .

The death has attracted national attention after Arizona Cardinals star wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald tweeted a picture of Youvella and asked people to pray for the teen's family, friends and teammates. A community memorial is planned for Wednesday evening at the high school auditorium. The Arizona Interscholastic Association says Charles Youvella died with his family by his side.

Disapproving: Top Gear presenter said that the festival is marred by violence and arrests . The Notting Hill carnival is now ‘like being in Soviet Russia’, with police helicopters circling overhead and sirens blaring, Jeremy Clarkson has claimed. The August Bank Holiday festival, which attracts one million revellers every year, has been marred by violence and drunkenness in recent years. At this year’s two-day event, more than 300 people were arrested and a further 300 were treated by the emergency services. The Top Gear presenter said that, far from being a ‘gooey muddle of love’, the event was now dominated by police officers trying to keep the peace. Clarkson suggested that the event was only allowed to continue because it was seen as a celebration of ‘multiculturalism’. Writing in a newspaper column, he said that politicians were eager to promote Notting Hill Carnival as ‘a tremendous event which brings us all together in a gooey muddle of love and music and strangely-scented tobacco’. Clarkson wrote: ‘Afterwards, the police always tell us that it was very ‘peaceful’ and then they post amusing videos on YouTube, showing officers dancing with the crowds and ‘twerking’. Lovely. ‘But from where I was sitting, about a mile down the road, it sounded like I was on the set of Hill Street Blues. ‘Every few moments a cop car screamed past, its siren blaring and then, before it had faded into the distance, a convoy of ambulances roared by, their lights flashing. ‘Meanwhile, high in the sky a police surveillance helicopter spent all day hovering over the same spot, its camera pointed ominously into the crowds. It was like being in Soviet Russia.’ ‘Peaceful? Doesn’t sound that way to me.’ Crowds: At this year's two-day event, more than 300 people were arrested and a further 300 were treated by the emergency services .

Police . officers were photographed separating topless men as they fought with . each other, and grappling a man to the ground as they handcuffed him. Clarkson added: ‘If there were 300 arrests at a football match and 300 injuries, there would be hell to pay. ‘There’d . be bans and fines and the club would be told that unless they bucked . their ideas up, there would be no more football in their stadium until . the end of time. ‘But of course, the Notting Hill Carnival is the shining jewel in the crown of multiculturalism. ‘So it was peaceful and wonderful and everyone got on terribly well.’ In total, 301 people were arrested, 23 more than the previous year. Of these, 96 were held for drug crimes and 64 for public order offences, while others were arrested for carrying weapons, assaults on police officers and grievous bodily harm. There were three sex attacks, and more than 300 people were treated for cuts, bruises and alcohol-related injuries. The Metropolitan Police said 6,000 officers were on duty at the carnival on Sunday and just under 7,000 on Bank Holiday Monday.

Henry was photographed running away from Mr Andre with a bloodied knife after stabbing him in the abdomen, in an image that shocked the world.

Shift in powers: Chief constables could be stripped of powers to investigate their own officers for rudeness or laziness on duty, a minister signalled today . Critics of police disciplinary systems have long complained that too many investigations are carried out ‘in house’. Some senior officers have been accused of being too willing to brush allegations under the carpet or let their officers escape with only a low level penalty. Last year the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) warned that forces were ignoring or wrongly dismissing thousands of complaints that officers were rude, lazy or failing in their duty. Ministers have already announced that all serious and sensitive allegations against the police will be handled by the IPCC - which will be given tens of millions of pounds to take on work that was previously carried out by internal standards departments. But the latest move raises the prospect of forces losing all control over complaints against their officers. Mr Green, warning that policing can be too insular, says elected Police and Crime Commissioners or PCCs have been lobbying ministers for more power to carry out their own investigations. Turning a blind eye: Last year the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) warned that forces were ignoring or wrongly dismissing thousands of complaints that officers were rude, lazy or failing in their duty . In a speech to a conference of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners in central London, Mr Green will say: ‘Public confidence in the police requires appropriate action to be taken against officers when wrongdoing is identified. ‘And they must be sure that investigations against the police are pursued without fear or favour for those involved. The ‘vast majority’ of day-to-day policing is conducted with the ‘utmost efficacy and professionalism’, he will say. Crackdown: Damian Green, warning that policing can be too insular, says elected Police and Crime Commissioners or PCCs have been lobbying ministers for more power to carry out their own investigations . ‘But when it is not, complaints of something as simple as basic rudeness can damage an individual’s confidence in policing.’ Having PCCs take a bigger role in complaints has ‘some obvious attractions’, he will say. ‘It would serve to increase accountability and transparency in the complaints system and, therefore, increase public confidence.’ Mr Green will defend the decision to abolish police authorities, which were replaced by PCCs following elections a year ago. Ahead of Friday’s one year anniversary of the elections, which were blighted by low turnout, Mr Green will say PCCs are ‘here to stay’ and were an important element of democratic control of policing. He will say: ‘Far from shying away from our landmark reform it is our intention to reinforce, strengthen and expand this new democratic institution. ‘Police authorities were invisible and unaccountable - the very opposite of the system we have introduced. ‘Policing, by its very nature, tends towards insularity. PCCs are beginning to take that away by being more aware of, and responsive to, the communities they serve.’ Almost two-thirds of appeals were overturned by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2011, after forces had first ruled the allegations were unfounded. Some 54,714 individual allegations were made against police officers and staff in 2011 - the equivalent of one every ten minutes. Most were for officers’ failure to do their job or for being rude to the public. It could mean around one in five police workers had an allegation made against them. One in four (28 per cent) was for neglect or failure in duty - a total of 15,201 complaints - while one in six was for lack of civility, impoliteness or intolerance.","Low level misconduct probes could be handled by Crime Commissioners .

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 19:58 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:08 EST, 14 November 2013 . Social mobility has stalled in Britain because young people from modest backgrounds lack aspiration and no longer believe they can make it to the top, David Cameron suggested yesterday. Endorsing his predecessor Sir John Major’s comment that there are too many ‘posh’ people in top jobs, he said the Government and the professions need to move ‘further and faster’ to change that. Mr Cameron said it was ‘not enough’ to provide children from poor families with ‘equality of opportunity’, as so many are not confident enough to seize the chances presented to them. Sir John Major, who rose from a council estate to Downing Street, said it was 'shocking' that people from private schools had such a grip on top jobs . Singling out the Army and the judiciary for special criticism, the Prime Minister called for senior figures in those professions to actively ‘find’ poor but talented students and ‘get them to raise aspirations’, rather than sitting back and simply waiting for them to apply. ‘I do believe it’s not good enough just to make changes and sit back,’ he said. ‘You’ve got to get out there and try and attract talented people. Don’t just open the door and say we are in favour of equality of opportunity – that’s not enough. You’ve got to get out there and find them, win them over, get them to raise aspirations and get them to think they can get all the way to the top.’ Prime Minister called for senior figures in those professions to actively 'find' poor but talented students . The comments, which come after Mr Cameron said many British youngsters are less qualified for the world of work than immigrants, are likely to anger some voters. He was educated at Eton and Oxford and presides over a Cabinet packed with millionaires. Sir John Major, who rose from a council estate to Downing Street, said last week that it was ‘truly shocking’ that people from private schools had such a grip on top jobs in politics and other professions. ‘In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class,’ he said. ‘To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.’ Speaking yesterday as he flew to India ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka, Mr Cameron said: ‘I agree with John Major that we need a far more socially mobile country, and that is something we need to do far more about. ‘He’s raised a very important issue. You only have to look at the make-up of Parliament, the judiciary, the Army, the media, it’s not as diverse, there’s not as much social mobility as there needs to be. ‘I want to see a Britain where, no matter where you come from, what God you worship, the colour of your skin, the community you belong to, you can get to the top in television, you can get to the top in the judiciary, you can get to the top in the armed services, you can get to the top in politics. ‘We are making some progress in those areas, that is not fast enough, we need to go further and faster. So I absolutely agree with the thrust of what John Major said.’ Sir John said 'the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class' Mr Cameron defended his appointment of public schoolboys to his Cabinet and private office staff but boasted that he has increased the number of ethnic minority MPs in the Conservative Party. ‘I employ people on the basis of: are they the right person to do the job, and have they got the skills and talents? I’m obviously choosing in terms of Parliament from the current pool of MPs. There’s always more that could be done. ‘In some areas I’ve had some success. There were no MPs on my side of British Indian or British Afro-Caribbean backgrounds, now there are. We’re making some progress. Is it fast enough? No.’ The Prime Minister also pointed out that he appointed Patrick McLoughlin as Transport Secretary. ‘I don’t think the last Labour government had a former working miner in the Cabinet,’ he said. Mr Cameron insisted the Government has already done much to improve social mobility, citing the pupil premium, which channels extra money to schools with poorer pupils, improved childcare. Despite the increase in university tuition fees, ‘the number of people going to university from deprived backgrounds is actually at record levels’, he said. But Labour frontbencher Kevin Brennan said: ‘David Cameron has shown shocking complacency towards the one million young people unemployed under him. ‘Now he tells them that they lack aspiration. It is he who is locking out opportunity for the next generation and standing up only for a privileged few.’ Former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, now a social mobility adviser to the Government, said ‘elitism is entrenched’ in British society – but insisted Sir John was wrong to blame the situation on the last Labour government. ‘Deep-rooted inequality and flatlining mobility have been decades in the making,’ he said. ‘Some say it is an impossible task to undo them. I do not succumb to that pessimism.’","PM said it was 'not enough' to provide children from poor families with equality of opportunity' as many not confident enough to seize chances .

'@natsecwonk': Under an anonymous Twitter account Jofi Joseph bashed his bosses and other Washington elites . The man that was fired from his White House job for making anonymous attacks on administration officials on Twitter may now be investigated for possibly hiring prostitutes. Jofi Joseph was fired on Tuesday after he was unmasked as the man behind the @NatSecWonk account that had captivated so much of D.C. by taking shots at politicians and hinting of his exclusive knowledge. Now investigators Joseph, who is married, may be connected to another anonymous account that frequently made mentions of hiring prostitutes. While Joseph has come forward and put out a statement apologizing for the 'inappropriate and mean-spirited comments' that he made via @NatSecWonk, he made no mention of any connection to the second account, called @DCHobbyist. That account has now been shut following the swarm of attention, but Foreign Policy reports that it directed a number of tweets at self-identified escorts. At one point, @DCHobbyist wrote about Toronto's 'tsunami of gorgeous and sensual escorts'. Just three days later, it directed a message to a woman who identified herself as a 'luxury companion and escort' and wrote 'I hopey ou know that I reminisce fondly about our date. Do let me know if you ever find your way back to DC.' A second account? Some believe Joseph may be behind this second parody account, and if so, it will be problematic for him as it frequently discusses soliciting prostitutes . If the two accounts are connected, Joseph may face legal problems regarding his alleged use of prostitutes. Not only is solicitation a crime, but there are political concerns as well since Joseph's wife is a well-respected advisor on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Aside from the moral repercussions of cheating, there is inevitably concern about the prospect of being blackmailed for information or access, based either on his now-former role as a non-proliferation director on the National Security Council or his wife Carolyn Leddy's role in the Senate. After first refusing to comment to Politico's Glenn Thrush about the scandal when it first broke on Wednesday, saying that it would 'affect his ability to get a new job,' he followed up with a formal statement. 'Beer goggles': Joseph tweeted that Huma Abedin must have been wearing beer goggles when she married Anthony Wiener . International: He also made light of Samantha Powers' marriage to Cass Sunstein before she was appointed as the current American ambassador to the United Nations . 'It has been a privilege to serve in this Administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me,' he said in the statement. He went on to explain that it 'started out as an intended parody account of DC culture'. Those comments included insults hurled at Republicans and Democrats alike. Attacking both sides: NatSecWonk called President Obama's close advisor Valerie Jarrett a 'vacuous cipher' (left) and Republican Sarah Palin 'white trash (right) 'So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family? What utter useless garbage,' he tweeted last October about the former Republican Vice Presidential nominee. Before Anthony Weiner's first trouble with Twitter that ended his Congressional career, and before Samantha Powers was appointed as the American ambassador to the United Nations, he took aim at their love choices. 'Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Wiener? Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein,' @NatSecWonk tweeted in 2011. There were serious comments about political connections as well- rather than petty personal jabs. 'I'm a fan of Obama, but his continuing reliance and dependence upon a vacuous cipher like Valerie Jarrett concerns me,' he said of the President's longtime friend and advisor. 'More people should be asking why John Kerry installed two former aides, both with ZERO foreign policy experience, into top posts at State,' he also wrote.","Jofi Joseph is a director of non-proliferation section of the National Security Staff at the White House .

Veteran ABC News anchor and reporter Sam Donaldson was found not guilty of driving drunk in a Delaware court late last week in a hearing that stemmed from a December 2012 traffic stop. The 79-year-old former chief White House correspondent was pulled over on December 1 after a Lewes, Delaware officer saw his vehicle weaving from one shoulder of the road to the other and then failed a field sobriety test. Officer Katie Couchman testified Friday that she also smelled booze in Donaldson’s SUV when he rolled down the window and saw a re-corked bottle of wine, but the prosecution’s case faltered when it was revealed that Couchman’s original police report failed to make note of the wine bottle and of Donaldson’s admission to having had ‘a few glasses of wine.’ Not guilty: 42-year ABC News journalist Sam Donaldson was found not guilty on Friday of driving while drunk in the followup to a 2012 DUI arrest . Judge Rosemary B. Beauregard also agreed with the defense’s argument that the field sobriety test should never have been administered to Donaldson, whose advanced age could have accounted for his difficulty with remaining balanced. ‘When you do not follow the training and you know you’re not following the training,’ Beauregard said at the close of the five hour long trial, ‘it’s not an indicator [of intoxication] at all.’ According to the News Journal, the defense pointed out that no one over 65 is supposed to have such tests administered. Beauregard’s decision was also motivated by the discrepancies between Couchman’s testimony and police report, which does not mention a bottle of wine was in the car. ‘It not being there gives the court pause as to the accuracy of the information the court has received,’ Beauregard said. ‘Despite the suspicious driving and the odor of alcohol, I simply do not find there is probable cause for arrest.’ Thrown out: While the arresting officer testified that Donaldson admitted to having imbibed that night and saw a re-corked bottle of wine in the car, she included neither in her 2012 police report. The judge found that there was no cause for arrest . Donaldson retired from full-time work at ABC News after 42 years as one of the network’s most recognized reporters. The veteran news man showed typical camera-ready poise after the verdict was read. ‘You did your duty as you saw fit,’ Donaldson said after approaching Couchman. ‘I bear no animus toward you whatsoever.’ Donaldson also spoke with reporters following the trial. ‘Had I been convicted, I would have never worn it as a badge of honor,’ he said. ‘I didn’t believe I was intoxicated over the limit. Of course, it never got to that point [in the trial]. But it’s dangerous, and we should all guard against it.’","The longtime ABC News anchor was charged with driving while intoxicated in late 2012 .

The euro zone economy all but stagnated in the third quarter of the year with France's recovery fizzling out and growth in Germany slowing. The 9.5 trillion euro economy pulled out of its longest recession in the previous quarter but record unemployment, lack of consumer confidence and anaemic bank lending continue to prevent a more solid rebound. In the three months to September, the combined economy of the 17 countries sharing the euro grew by a slower than expected 0.1 per cent. In the previous quarter it rose 0.3 per cent – the first expansion in 18 months. Worry: France is becoming a focus for concern within the currency bloc . The euro fell to a session low in response. The French economy contracted by 0.1 per cent, snuffing out signs of revival in the previous three months. It had been expected to post quarterly growth of 0.1 per cent and has now shrunk in three of the last four quarters. German growth slowed to 0.3 per cent, from a robust 0.7 in the second quarter, but Europe's largest economy clearly remains in much better shape. There were positive signs in the southern periphery with Portugal growing 0.2 percent on the quarter after a 1.1 percent rise in the previous three months and Spain returning to a tepid growth of 0.1 percent - its first positive number quarter-on-quarter since the first quarter of 2011. France is becoming a focus for concern within the currency bloc. The Bank of France predicts the economy will expand by 0.4 per cent in the last quarter of the year but the government's labour and pension reforms are widely viewed as too timid. A report on French competitiveness by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned that it is falling behind southern European countries that have cut labour costs and become leaner and meaner. ‘To reduce the economic lag and lost time, France needs to keep up structural reforms,’ OECD chief Angel Gurria said. The report will be hard for the government to ignore since it was commissioned by President Francois Hollande. Study: Francois Hollande commissioned a report by the OECD on French competitiveness, which found that France is lagging behind some European countries . German growth was fuelled by domestic demand. Exports faltered, another indication of the malaise gripping the rest of the euro zone. ‘ECB interest rates are far too low for Germany. Germany will probably grow significantly more strongly than the euro zone,’ said Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank. ‘Early indicators point to similar growth in the fourth quarter.’ The European Commission forecasts the currency area will shrink by 0.4 per cent over 2013 as a whole before growing by a modest 1.1 per cent in 2014. However, with unemployment in the bloc running above 12 per cent and one in two young people out of work in Greece and Spain, talk of recovery rings hollow. Compounding the French gloom, private sector payroll data showed some 17,000 jobs were destroyed in the third quarter, while inflation slowed in October to 0.7 per cent, the weakest level in four years, when France was emerging from a deep recession.","In the previous quarter the 17 euro economies grew by 0.3 per cent .

Just when you thought parking inspectors were the most-hated profession around, in come the 'odor investigators'. Pot smokers in Denver, Colorado - where the limited sale, possession and growth of recreational marijuana is legal - have had their noses put out of joint recently by Public Health agents dubbed the 'Nasal Rangesr', whose job is to sniff them out. Denver Department of Environmental Health officer Ben Siller uses his 'smellescrope' - proper name Olfactometer - to detect marijuana odor and then investigate whether the law has been broken based on the strength of the smell. Siller acts on complaints that are filed by people who report strong smells of the drug. Complaints about pot smells doubled in Denver from 2010 to 2012. Take a big wiff: 'Nasal Rangers' have become an increased presence in Denver since the decriminalization of recreational marijuana, which has seen complaints of 'pot smells' double . But backers of Amendment 64 - the monumental Colorado bill that legalized the use of marijuana in the state - say it is unconstitutional. Siller, who has been investigating odor complaints (not restricted to marijuana) for 26 years, told 7News that his job is primarily to call out businesses that grow marijuana and are affecting neighbors and passers-by with the plant's stench. His job, he says, is not to track down smokers enjoying legal weed in the privacy of their homes. According to the Denver Post, the odor has to reach a level of 8:1 in order to receive a fine of $2000. Such a violation has not been reported since 1994. 'It has to be a very strong odor,' Siller said. Field of grass: The primary focus of 'Nasal Rangers' is to use their smellescope to find growth plants, such as this one, and determine if any laws have been broken . The Nasal Ranger is a portable odor detecting and measuring instrument that can quantify odor strength in ambient air, according to device developers St. Croix Sensory. They cost about $1,500 and are used to detect the strength of other smells also, such a wood fire pizza shop that is creating too much smoke. A major issue in Denver at the moment is a proposal to make the very smell of marijuana a public crime. The city council have considered a ban to stop the odor drifting over fences into neighbors homes or being smelt in popular areas, such as the 16th Street Mall. 'Odor can be subject' said Mary Beth Susman, Council President. 'It's hard to legislate odor. 'The strength that is required to register on the Nasal Ranger is something we need to look at. 'I also wonder if people will get used to the smell (now it's legal) and the dislike of it now may change over time.' The first recreational marijuana shops are expected to open in Colorado on Jan. 1, 2014. While it means weed will be available in the retail sphere, the law will still only permit it to be smoked in private . A64 states that adults can possess up to an ounce of pot, can grow as many as six marijuana plants at home (with only three flowering at any given time), but home-grown marijuana can only be for personal use and cannot be sold. However, adults can gift one another up to an ounce of pot. The first recreational marijuana shops are expected to open on Jan. 1, 2014. Another spike in complaints of the smell of marijuana is expected around that time.","Colorado has seen a rise in 'Nasal Rangers' ever since voters legalized marijuana last November .
The passing of Amendment 64 meant investigating 'pot smells' was no longer a police matter but one for the Department of Environmental Health .
The officers use a 'Nasal Ranger' device, which straps onto their nose, to determine if a smell is beyond the acceptable legal parameters .
The Rangers say there job is to locate pot growers breaking the law and not bust people smoking in the privacy of their home .

A strain of bird flu that scientists thought could not infect people has been discovered in a Taiwanese woman. The news has sparked fears that such strains could ignite a new global outbreak if scientists don't do more to spot them early on. The woman, 20, was hospitalized in May with a lung infection but was released after being treated with Tamiflu and antibiotics. Prevention: A worker injects a chicken with vaccine at a hennery in Huai'an, east China's Jiangsu province in attempt to stop bird flu spreading amongst the animals . One of her throat swabs was sent to the Taiwan Centres for Disease Control and experts there have identified as the H6N1 bird flu, which has been widely circulating in chickens on the island. The patient, who was not identified, worked in a deli and had no known connection to live birdsaccording to research published online today in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

She also said it was worrying that scientists had no early warning signals that such new bird flus could be a problem until humans fell ill. Scientists often monitor birds to see which viruses are killing them, in an attempt to guess which flu strains might be troublesome for humans - but neither H6N1 nor H7N9 make birds very sick. Koopmans called for increased surveillance of animal flu viruses and more research into predicting which viruses might cause a global crisis.

The chief of an Alabama police department is giving one of his officers a chance at redemption after a video of the officer drag-racing with a pedestrian with his city-issued motorcycle went viral on the Internet, prompting the officer to turn in his resignation. Montgomery Police Chief Kevin Murphy has reinstated officer Carlos Rogers, who is seen on video drag-racing with a motorist on a busy street not once, but twice. Murphy says Rogers' willingness to take responsibility for his actions - by resigning without being told to do so - played a part in his decision to reinstate him. Eat my dust: Officer Carlos Rogers has been reinstated after resigning following a viral video showing him racing a pedestrian on a city-issued motorcycle . Embarrassed: After seeing the video, Rogers says he was so embarrassed by his actions that he resigned . The incident occurred on Sunday, when Rogers pulled up to a red light and a man on a motorcycle next to him asked him if he wanted to race. 'I got a turbo in this thing,' Rogers told the pedestrian, before speeding away on his police motorcycle. Rogers and the pedestrian, identified as Lawrence Lee Spillers, came to a second red light, at which point they raced again. Spillers recorded the entire incident on a camera attached to his helmet, and insists that neither he, nor the officer, ever went faster than 60 mph. 'Man worth saving': Rogers says he wanted to show the pedestrian that cops aren't always aggressive and can be friendly . Spillers says he think the officer was 'just trying to have a good time,' and that he shouldn't lose his job over the incident. Murphy, however - before deciding to reinstate Rogers - told CNN that the officer handled the situation horribly, and could potentially face a traffic citation in addition to quitting his job. According to Murphy, when Spillers asked Rogers if he wanted to race, the officer should have responded, 'no, young man. I write tickets for that and I don't suggest you do it.' On Thursday, however, Murphy changed his tune and decided that Rogers is an officer 'worth saving.' 'He cared so much and felt so bad he hurt us that he decided to step . down,' Murphy said. 'A man like that, in my book, deserves a second . chance.' Rogers explained his actions as an attempt to comradery with a fellow biker, and to demonstrate that police officers aren't always aggressive and combative, and can sometimes even be friendly. But after seeing the video, Rogers says he felt like he let the department down. Second Chance: Chief Kevin Murphy says Rogers' willingness to accept responsibility is part of the reason he was reinstated . 'I saw the video and I was called in about it, and I decided to resign because I was embarrassed,' Rogers said. 'I couldn't take the embarrassment that I knew was going to follow that. I never intended to bring a negative view onto the city, to the Montgomery Police Department or myself.' Rogers, who has been with the department for four years - and part of the traffic division since April - has returned to active duty, but will be assigned to administrative duties temporarily, as Murphy says the officer will need to earn his way back onto the streets. Murphy says he often warns young officers that their generation will the most scrutinized because of cell phones and social media. 'For every cellular phone in the room, there are an equal amount of cameras and also the ability to take video footage,' Murphy said. 'The point is, the camera is always on. And your actions, no matter what they are, are going to be scrutinized.'","Montgomery, Alabama Police Chief Kevin Murphy says Officer Carlos Rogers' willingness to take responsibility for his actions is part of the reason he decided to reinstate him .

A teenage motorcyclist who repeatedly flicked a V-sign at the same speed camera as he roared past at double the speed limit has been banned from the road for a year. Luke Weeks brazenly mocked police by making the rude gesture at cameras, believing he could not be caught because his licence plate was not visible. But eventually police had so many images of him racing past the camera that they were able to track him down and arrest him. Ban: Luke Weeks has been barred from driving after repeatedly flashing a V-sign at speed cameras . Medway magistrates heard that the 19-year-old was caught speeding 19 times by the same speed camera in Dartford, Kent between May 27 and August 27 this year. He was travelling at speeds up to 60mph in a 30mph zone, and added to the danger by taking his hands off the handlebars and making rude gestures at the camera. Weeks was apparently confident that he would get away with it because the camera faced the front of his bike and so could not read the licence plate on the rear. Cases such as this one have prompted campaigners to call for motorbikes to have compulsory licence plates on the front and back, like cars. Dangerous: At one point Weeks was shown with no hands on the bike even as he was carrying a passenger . The court heard that Weeks had two motorbikes, a Honda CB 250 and a Suzuki SV 650 SY, on which he raced through his home town. Magistrates were told that he rode with 'no hands... and made offensive gestures even with a pillion passenger holding onto him'. Weeks pleaded guilty to 19 counts of speeding and three counts of careless driving, and was fined £10 for each of the speeding offences, as well as £125 in court costs. He was also banned from driving for a year, and ordered to take an extended driving test. Repeat offender: Weeks, 19, was caught speeding 19 times by a single camera in Dartford, Kent . Katherine Meehan of the Kent and Medway Safety Camera Partnership said: 'The safety camera is there to reduce the number of crashes and casualties within the signed area, and is regularly visited by a safety camera van to further try to reduce speeding along this stretch of road. 'Mr Weeks posed a serious threat to himself, his passenger and other road users. Fortunately a collision did not occur on these occasions. 'Thankfully the majority of young riders do not display this behaviour, however in the past three years in our county there were 546 collisions involving 16- to 19-year-olds on motorcycles.'","Luke Weeks, 19, repeatedly flicked V-sign at speed cameras in Dartford .

He is the president of the student body at Northwest Christian University in Oregon . The president of a student body at a Christian university in Oregon has shocked his peers by coming out as an atheist. Eric Fromm, 21, a senior at Northwest Christian University in Eugene, revealed he does not believe in God in the student-run online newspaper, Beacon Bolt, in a blog post on October 30. Fromm told the student community that he finally confessing because he was feeling ‘burdened’ by living a constant lie about his faith. ‘I am an atheist. Yes, you read that correctly, I am an atheist,’ he wrote in the blog post he entitled, Lifting the Curtain. Fromm admitted he chose the school because it had a solid communications program. ‘Before I enrolled, I visited the campus to make sure that the chapel services were comfortable enough that I could fulfil the requirement,’ he said. ‘No one was speaking in tongues or handling snakes, so I decided to stay.’ Good school: Fromm said he chose Northwest-Christian-University because of its communications program . A journey: Jeannine Jones, the university's director of relations, said Eric's path to his faith is 'central to our mission' However, he has been living in constant fear of . his peers rejecting him ‘because of the fact that I don’t believe in God . – because I am an atheist’. So, he decided to come out. The university’s director of university relations, Jeannine Jones, told ABC News that this did not come as a surprise. ‘Eric and his journey to his faith are central to our mission,’ she said. ‘All . of our students are on a journey. While the majority of our students . profess a Christian faith, not all do. We as an institution meet . students were they are at and believe that our God is big enough.’ The . school’s website says its mission is to ‘highlight our Christian . identity in ways that unite Christians everywhere, and not in ways that . tend to cause division between various groups of Christians.

He is also getting a lot more support at the university than he anticipated. ‘I . was expecting for it to be non-accepting and I was very afraid of it,’ Fromm told ABC News. ‘I actually have gotten more hugs than ever . before. It's a very strange thing.’ Confession: Fromm came out as an atheist in a blog post in the online student newspaper, Beacon Bolt . Some comments in a local paper that picked up on the story, the Eugene Register-Guard, have criticised Fromm’s actions. ‘Atheists actions are quite contradictory. First, they say their lives are like a drop in the ocean. That is, their lives and their actions are but an accident and also insignificant in the whole scheme of things. YET, they go about advertising and preaching their OWN INSIGNIFICANCE?’ said one. Brandon McGinnis, Fromm's former roommate and editor-in-chief of the Beacon Bolt, said rumours had started to spread around campus that Fromm hated Christians. ‘Eric was upset people were questioning the way they were,’ McGinnis told ABC News. Fromm, who was baptized Lutheran and raised Methodist, was an atheist before starting at the university. Fromm, left, published his controversial thoughts in the student-run paper, Beacon Bolt. The paper's editor-in-chief, Brandon McGinnis, right, who is also his former roommate, said rumours had started spreading around campus that Fromm 'hated Christians'.

Fromm will not be asked to step down as the president of the student body at NCU over this article, according to Jones. Fromm said he was also shocked to see how many people online have reached out to him with their own personal stories and also to tell him he was an inspiration to them. 'I have learned so many things about people's struggles,' Fromm said. 'I never really knew that people could struggle, that an atheist could feel this struggle.

'John . never showed signs that football was getting to him, the locker room was . getting to him,' Mr Incognito asserted. The footballer then said that he 'never saw it coming,' and that the media's portrayal of him as a bully is 'not even close.' He also admitted he understands why people might see him as a 'knucklehead' or a 'loose cannon' and said that his usage of the n-word isn't uncommon in NFL locker rooms, even by Mr Martin, but that still doesn't excuse his bahavior. 'I’m not a racist... [but] in no way . shape or form is it right for me to use that word,' said a contrite Mr Incognito. Mr Incognito then thanked his Dolphins teammates for standing up for him, 'for telling the truth,' when the media descending on the locker room and started asking questions. 'All this stuff coming out... speaks to the culture of our locker room,' Mr Incognito continued. 'It speaks to the culture of our closeness, it speaks to the culture of our brotherhood.' 'I never saw it coming': The offensive lineman said he regrets not seeing that the vulgar joking was bother Mr Martin, he wishes he could have done something . 'I'm sorry': The footballer said he would apologize to both Mr Martin and his family if he had the opportunity, and admitted things may have gone too far . When asked what he'd say if Mr Martin was sitting next to him, Mr Incognito said he'd give him a hug say he is sorry. I think I’d give him a big hug right now because we’ve been through so much and I’d be like, 'dude what’s going on?' 'If he were to say 'listen, you took it way to far, you hurt me,' You know I would just apologize and explain to him exactly what I just explained to you, and I’d apologize to his family, they took it as malicious,' Mr Incognito continued. 'I never meant it that way.' The nine-year pro was interviewed Saturday in Los Angeles by Mr Glazer, who mostly kept the promise made earlier on Twitter that he wouldn’t hold back in his questioning. Mr Incognito was photographed leaving Los Angeles International Airport a day earlier. Questions . are expected to cover the NFL’s investigation into the Dolphins as . allegations of racism and abuse run rampant through the locker room. 'The racism, the bad words,' Mr Incognito said, looking down and taking a pause before adding 'that's what I regret most.' Calling . the shocking speech 'a product of our environment,' Mr Incognito then . further excuses the vulgar talk as 'something we use all the time.' The interview comes after fresh allegations against Incognito including claims he molested a female volunteer with a golf club during a team-sponsored charity golf tournament last year, according to reports. The harassment allegation became public after WPLG obtained a copy of the police report filed May 18, 2012 by the 34-year-old woman. Road trip: Richie Incognito arrives yesterday in Los Angeles to a media storm as more abuse allegations are made public . Mr Incognito’s lewd behavior occurred during the annual Fins Weekend Golf Tournament at the Turnberry Resort and Club, the incident report said. The woman accused the footballer of using a golf club to rub her privates and knock her glasses off her head, a copy of the report reviewed by MailOnline alleges. The woman said Mr Incognito had been drinking during the event. ‘After that, he proceeded to lean up against her buttocks with his private parts as if dancing, saying ‘Let it rain, Let it Rain!’ The report said. ‘He finally finished his inappropriate behavior by emptying bottled water in her face,’ said the report.The woman told cops arriving on the scene that several people saw the inappropriate behaviour and did nothing to stop it. They once were friends: Miami Dolphins guard Richie Incognito (68), center left, and and tackle Jonathan Martin (71), center right, sit on the bench during a 2013 preseason game . Had Mr Incognito simply apologized, it does not appear she would have filed the report. Instead, ‘she felt like he didn't care and thought the whole incident was in fun and games,’ the report reads. ‘Other people apologized for him, but not him.’ Dolphins team security said they would handle the issue when it was brought to their attention, but the woman told authorities nothing was done. The woman is not allowed to speak publicly about the incident after signing a confidentiality agreement, according to WPLG. The golf outing accusation is the third in a series of shocking stories involving the previously under-the-radar football player. Last month, a series of voicemails left for teammate Jonathan Martin emerged that showed Mr Incognito using racial slurs and threatening physical violence against him. Mr Incognito was suspended indefinitely from the team while an investigation is carried out. Mr Martin has since left the team to seek counseling, and accused unspecified teammates of threatening to rape his sister. His teammates are confused: Many teammates have come out against Mr Martin, with some claiming that they don't understand what he's doing . In the time since his suspension, Mr Incognito has told those close to him that he feels betrayed by Mr Martin, a rookie that other Dolphins have publicly said the veteran took under his wing. A source told ESPN the allegations 'shocked' Mr Incognito, and that he feels betrayed. 'It's probably a combination of totally blindsided and a bit betrayed,' the source told the network. 'He's shocked. He can't believe this happened and thinks it probably could have been avoided.' To his credit, several teammates have spoken out in favor of Mr Incognito, and also said many of the comments were taken out of context. 'I don't think what happened is necessary,' teammate Tyson Clabo told ESPN. 'I don't know why he's doing this. And the only person who knows why is Jonathan Martin.' Just this past week, a video emerged of an out-of-control, drunk, shirtless Mr Incognito rampaging through a bar shouting the n-word as terrified patrons dove for cover. The team has not publicly commented on the two latest incidents.","Richie Incognito has been suspended indefinitely by the Miami Dolphins for bullying former teammate Jonathan martin .

A Wisconsin family’s beloved dog was found killed by an arrow this week and her horrified owners believe hunters did it on purpose. After Tanya and Chris Meyer of Rome posted their unthinkable tale on Facebook, support has poured in from animal lovers around the world to help this family get justice for one-year-old Labrador mix Zoey. ‘My daughter just loved her, and they had this special bond,’ said a grieving Tanya Meyer. 'My daughter just loved her, and they had this special bond': A Wisconsin couple was horrified this week when they found their beloved dog shot dead by a hunter's arrow . According to WTMJ, the Meyers believe Zoey was killed Friday after she went playing in the woods surrounding their home along with Maggie, the family’s other dog. Tanya knew something was wrong when only Maggie returned that day. ‘I started calling for her and she wasn’t answering,’ Meyer told the LA Times. Along with his father, Chris continued to search over the weekend. Unthinkable: Tanya Meyer and her husband Chris believe their Lab mix Zoey was killed by hunter neighbors last Friday after she became a nuisance to them . Somethings amiss: One-year-old Zoey and the Meyer's other dog Maggie went into the woods surrounding their house Friday, but only Maggie came back . ‘He asked some hunting neighbors,’ Tanya told WTMJ, ‘and they said “well, we saw her this morning and threw some sticks at 'em because they were bothering us in our tree stand but we haven't seen them since.”’ Three days later, Chris finally found Zoey. She was dead from an arrow wound under those very hunters’ tree stand. The investigation is ongoing and the Meyers have thus far declined to name names, but they’re confident they know who took what was essentially one of their children. ‘For somebody that can do something like this, it's evil and it's cruel. You took our dog, you took our baby,’ said Tanya, who also has a 6-month-old baby girl. ‘She was just a perfect dog for my . daughter to grow up with and then to find out that something like this . happened, it was like “how could you?’” The . Meyers posted their story on a Facebook page called Justice for Zoey . and a post on the page has been shared nearly 150,000 times. Chris Meyer, at right with his daughter, searched over the weekend for Zoey. He asked some hunter neighbors about her, and they said they'd seen the dog and threw sticks at her to get her away from their tree stand . Horrific: Days after Chris's encounter with the hunters, he found Zoey's body, kiled by an arrow, under the same hunters' tree stand . People from around the world have sent out their condolences and posted the stories of their own pet tragedies. ‘I can't believe it. It's like people from Hong Kong and Iceland and Europe. It's just nuts,’ Tanya told WTMJ. ‘We're not looking for handouts or money or anything. We just want our healing to be done and over with and to kind of move on.’ In the meantime, Rome Police Chief Sergeant Jason Lauby told the Times that police and the Adams County Sherriff's Department are still investigating. But it’s the coldness of the crime that continues to stick with the Meyers, whether the culprits are caught or not. ‘To take the arrow out of her and to continue to hunt all weekend long, I just don’t have words for it. It sickens me,’ Tanya said. ‘I never thought people in the world were like this.’","Tanya and Chris Meyer of Rome, Wisconsin were horrified to find their beloved Labrador mix Zoey shot dead by an arrow earlier this week .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:39 EST, 27 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:09 EST, 27 March 2013 . A Texas man was today convicted of murdering an Austin mother whose husband spent 25 years behind bars before he was exonerated of her slaying in 2011. Jurors in San Angelo found Mark Alan Norwood guilty of capital murder for the 1986 beating death of Christine Morton, who was attacked in her north Austin home, and the 58-year-old was sentenced to life in prison. Morton's husband, Michael, was initially convicted in her death in 1987, but he was exonerated and freed in 2011 after new DNA testing was done on a bloody bandanna found near the couple's home. Guilty: Mark Norwwod, pictured in wheelchair, is taken out of the Tom Green County Courthouse in San Angelo, Texas, Wednesday, March 27, 2013 after being found guilty of the 1986 murder of Christine Morton . Justice: Michael Morton, left, and Dale Norwood embrace on the steps of the Tom Green County Courthouse Wednesday, March 27, 2013 in San Angelo, Texas after a guilty verdict was handed down to Norwood's brother, Mark Norwood . According to the San Angelo Standard-Times, prosecutors said Norwood beat and sexually assaulted the woman. Investigators said blood on the bandana led them to Norwood, whose DNA was in a national database as a result of his long criminal history. Norwood's lawyer suggested to jurors that the DNA evidence linking his client to the murder was contaminated. DNA testing wasn't available when the blood on the bandanna was initially tested in 1986. The testing wasn't done until Michael Morton's attorneys spent years lobbying for it. Norwood, 58, also has been indicted in a 1988 slaying of another Austin woman who lived near the Mortons. Prosecutors also told jurors that a gun Norwood stole from the Mortons' home and later sold linked him to the murder. Morton testified at the trial, telling jurors about the missing gun. Brutal: Prosecutors said Norwood, pictured left on March 20 and right in his mugshot, beat and sexually assaulted the woman . Guilty: Mark Norwood, pictured left on March 20, 2013, has been convicted of murdering an Austin mother whose husband spent 25 years behind bars before he was exonerated of her slaying in 2011 . The trial is being held in San Angelo after being moved from Williamson County, near Austin, because of publicity in the case. The Texas Attorney General's Office handled the prosecution and was not seeking the death penalty. Last month, a special hearing known as a court of inquiry was held to examine whether state District Judge Ken Anderson acted improperly in 1987 when, as Williamson County district attorney, he prosecuted Michael Morton. Morton's lawyers have accused Anderson of intentionally hiding evidence. Anderson has denied any wrongdoing. A decision by a judge on whether Anderson should face criminal charges in the case might come next month. Anderson also is being sued by the State Bar of Texas for his conduct in the Morton case. Anderson choked back tears on the witness stand during the special hearing as he recalled the prosecution he described as his 'worst nightmare.' Anderson, who is now a judge in Georgetown near Austin, is accused of withholding evidence indicating Morton's innocence during the original trial. Still to be sentenced: Investigators said blood on the bandana led them to Norwood, left, whose DNA was in a national database as a result of his long criminal history . Free man: Michael Morton, pictured on March 19, attended the opening statements of the murder trial of Mark Norwood . During days of testimony, the somber-looking Anderson sounded a defiant note when he told the court he did nothing wrong, saying that the office he ran was professional and competent. Then, his voice cracking, Anderson added, 'We got it right as much as we humanly could.' But despite his conviction that there was no misconduct on his part, Anderson offered an emotional apology to the wrongly convicted man. 'I know what me and my family have been through for 18 months of false accusations, and it doesn’t even register in the same ballpark of what you went through.' 'I don’t know that I can say I feel your pain, but I have a pretty darn good idea how horrible what you've gone through... with false accusations and everything else. What happened to you was so much worse than that. I can't imagine what you have been feeling,' Anderson told Morton in a quiet voice, American-Statesman reported. Happy family: Morton, left, was a married grocery store manager with a child when in 1987 his wife was beaten to death . He the added, 'I apologize that the . system screwed up. I've beaten myself up on what I could have done . different and I don't know. Maybe the Norwood prosecutor has something . the sheriff's office missed.' On his part, Morton has called for leniency for the man whose prosecution landed him in prison for a quarter of a century. In his testimony, Morton asked Judge . Louis Sturns to 'be gentle' with Anderson, explaining that he has 'a . little empathy' the former DA because he knows what's it like to have . 'everybody coming after you,' according to KXAN. Following Anderson's courtroom mea culpa, Morton said he was not expecting the encounter. 'This . is raw. It caught me really off guard,' he told the Statesman. 'I . wasn't prepared for it. I'm sure he would completely agree, but I'm not . sure he has a complete grasp of what this is all about, not personally.' Free at last: John W. Raley speaks with Patricia Morton, the mother of Michael Morton, right, before entering the court on the first day of the inquiry into former Williamson County D.A. Ken Anderson last month . Anderson, left, noted in his testimony that Morton, right, has been graceful towards him, even asking a judge to 'be gentle' with the former prosecutor . The February proceedings came on the . heels of an admission by a juror who originally convicted Morton that he . wished he would have had an opportunity to see police investigative . files and other key evidence during the trial. Mark Landrum was jury foreman in the 1987 case that sent Morton to prison for life. Morton . was freed on DNA evidence in 2011, and is now part of a special . proceeding known as a Court of Inquiry that will determine whether . Anderson could face criminal charges for allegedly withholding evidence. Landrum testified last month that during the trial, the defense 'constantly made sure we knew that there was no hard evidence.' Convict: Morton was found guilty of his wife's murder and sentenced to life in prison . 'They . said, ""It could have been an intruder, it could have been someone . else,"" ' Landrum said. 'I remember thinking, ""Wow, they created that . doubt on what the possibilities were.""' But, he added, Morton's legal . team ""didn't have any facts to hang"" those doubts on. During . the original case, which was tried in Georgetown, north of Austin, the . defense objected that prosecutors were withholding evidence. Presiding . Judge William Lott ordered Anderson to turn over case files that could . contain evidence aiding Morton's legal team. Anderson . produced only a few pages of information, which Lott decided wouldn't . sway the case. The defense and the jury never saw what Anderson gave the . judge. Omitted . from what Lott saw were case notes from police that the Mortons' three-year-old son told his grandmother he saw a 'monster,' not his . father, beating his mother. There . was also a report from a neighbor who said she previously saw a man . park a green van near the Morton home and head into a wooded area, as if . he were casing the residence. When presented with those facts last . month, Landrum said, 'I wish I had been given the opportunity to know . this while we were making our decision.' Landrum . also disputed, the theory now advanced by Morton's legal team, that . Anderson's co-prosecutor, Mike Davis, bragged to members of the jury . immediately after the case that if it had gotten a look at the police . files, the defense could have used them 'to raise even more doubt.' Rarely used, courts of inquiry can be ordered when legal officials and public servants are accused of wrongdoing. Justice: A court of inquiry is examining whether Anderson acted improperly in the 1987 case of Morton, who spent nearly 25 years in prison for killing his wife, but was exonerated in 2011 . Defiant: Ken Anderson defended his performance as Williamson County district attorney . During an argument at the hearing over introducing more evidence, Morton's attorney Rusty Hardin said that everything not admitted 'was like another day of freedom taken from' Morton. Anderson attorney Eric Nichols slammed his hand on a table and cried, 'Judge we need to stop this!' He yelled about 'speechmaking' and said past courts of inquiry in Texas have degenerated into 'circuses' and 'mob scenes.' Nichols argued that the original trial judge was actually only seeking Morton's testimony to police on the day of his wife's killing, making the rest of the case file, and police notes, irrelevant. He also questioned whether the defense attorney, Bill Allison, vigorously sought the evidence or could be exaggerating his recollections. Allison wavered a bit, saying, 'It's always bothered me that that would be the issue. How do you know what didn't happen?' Hardin then asked Allison how he would rate his work as a defense attorney. The witness choked up: 'I have felt for a long time that I really let Michael down in some way.' When Allison left the stand, Morton gave him a bear-hug. The hearing concluded with the testimony of another former district attorney, John Bradley. After Anderson became a judge, it fell to Bradley to continue overseeing the Morton case through the appeal process — and he argued for years against expanded DNA testing, once it became available in the matter. Bradley was defeated in the Republican primary last year, in part because of the publicity generated by Morton's exoneration.","Mark Alan Norwood, 58, convicted today of capital .

A homeless man who earned widespread admiration after handing in $850 he found to the police has been denied benefits because he failed to report the windfall. James Brady, 59, found the cash on Main Street in Hackensack, New Jersey last spring and turned it in to police. This selfless deed was reported nationally and made Brady something of a minor celebrity in his hometown. Honest: Formerly homeless James Brady was commended for turning in $850 he found, but denied benefits because he failed to report the 'income' In October, police returned the money to Brady because no one had claimed it. This was when his problems began. Brady has been denied General Assistance and Medicaid benefits by the Hackensack Human Services Department until December because he failed to report that he received the money. 'This is stupid,' Brady told the Record. 'I had already proven my honesty by turning in the $850. They were treating me like I was a dishonest individual, like I was trying to cheat them out of the money.' Brady was homeless at the time he found the money after years of depression and unemployment. After handing in the money to police because 'he didn't want to take money from anyone who could be worse off' that himself, things began to turn around for Brady. According to the Record, he began receiving psychiatric help and was placed on medication that helped him get back on track. He received praise from well-wishers and a commendation from the City Council, and moved into an apartment with a county housing voucher that paid for all but $5 of his $1,095. Honest: Hackensack Main Street, where a homeless James Brady found an envelope containing $850 and turned it into police . But Brady recently had a meeting with Human Services director Agatha Toomey who had a print-out of a news story about Brady's good deed and subsequent windfall. Toomey asked Brady how he had spent the $850. He told her he had bought napkins, toilet paper, a bathmat and a sandwich. He then received a letter informing him that his $210 per month and his Medicaid had been cut off from 18 October until 31 December. 'I’m sorry but we had to - I had to - follow regulations,' Toomey told the Record. 'He only pays five dollars [a month] in rent.' Brady's descent into homelessness began after the September 11 terrorist attacks in Manhattan. He had worked as a news photographer before becoming a market data analyst. He lost his job due to a merger and was looking for work in 2001. He had been due to attend a finance and technology exposition at the World Trade Center on September 11 but canceled. Brady was left traumatized by the knowledge he could have been killed in the attacks and sank into depression, using up his savings and retirement fund until he ws evicted from him apartment and became homeless. Of benefit: Brady receives $210 per month as well as medical benefits, both of which have been halted . Local councilors have expressed disappointment in the way Toomey has interpreted her duties. 'I think it’s very narrowly interpreted for someone to deny this kind of person,' said Councilwoman Rose Greenman . Gordon Johnson, a state assemblyman who represents Hackensack, told the Record: 'That’s a bit much to ask a homeless person who has a windfall of $800 - which is not really a windfall for his limited income. 'Where is the compassion in this?' Brady told the Record that he has an appointment with Legal Services next week and is hoping someone can help him restore his benefits. He has dental work that needs to be carried out urgently and also needs to maintain his psychiatric care, both of which are insurmountable without his Medicaid. Brady, who says he didn't even know how to go about reporting the $850, hopes the department will show more compassion towards people in need. 'They don't seem to want to help people,' he said.","James Brady found $850 in an envelope on the street and turned it in to police .

The women at the center of a lawsuit claiming their rights to dignity and privacy were violated by a Washington police department have spoken of their ordeal. Twelve victims claim they were filmed by security cameras as they stripped and, in some cases, used the toilet a at Payallup police station after being arrested for DUI. A Seattle defense attorney, who highlighted their plight, has likened the filming of the young women to 'a peep show'. Leading the case: Seattle attorney James Egan first filed a lawsuit on behalf of 11 women and one man in August. He has since been contacted by more than two dozen other people with similar stories . James Egan, who is representing the 12 victims in a lawsuit against the police, told ABC News show 20/20: 'I've represented 1,000 people in DUIs, . and I've never seen this.' After discovering that officers had been recording videos of mostly young women as they changed in police cells he contacted 11 women and a man who were alleged victims in the case in May. He said: 'This practice appears to be a peep show,' and added that his clients feared the footage could go viral on the internet because the footage is a public record. His clients are now suing city of Puyallup, police chief Bryan Jeter and Lieutenant Edward Shannon for allegedly violating their fundamental rights to bodily privacy and dignity and engaging in unlawful searches and seizures of the inmates. Some of the women at the center the case, who asked to remain anonymous, have spoken of their distress at the recordings. 'The fear, the embarrassment, the anger of knowing that somebody has these videos ... and it's happening to all these other women,' Plaintiff 4 told 20/20. 'I felt like a doll they were just . dressing up and dressing down ... and I didn't have the fight in me to . stand up for myself.' Indecent: Some of the videos, which were obtained by public record requests, show the women undressing . 'Sick': More than three dozen people being held in Puyallup city jail in Washington State on DUI charges have complained about their treatment at the facility after discovering intimate moments, such as going to the bathroom, were being recorded by CCTV cameras . Scene: The jail at the center of the action is inside this Puyallup Police building in Washington state . Although the jail has a curtained off area for inmates to change, the women were ordered to strip in  holding cell that has an overhead camera above. After changing into jail clothes the women were returned to the cell and forced to strip again so they could put on their own clothes before being released. At the time, they believed the procedure of stripping in front of a camera was part of police protocol. Since the original case was filed in August nearly 40 other women have come forward with similar stories. 'They're there to serve and protect and protect us, and they completely took advantage of each and every one of us,' Plaintiff 4 said. Plaintiff One added: 'I don't even think I really thought that that was something that was probably an ongoing recording, and, again, you're just - you know, kind of assume that that's just what is normal.' Another of the alleged victims said the cell was so cold she had to ask for a blanket, at which point an officer claimed he would be watching her. '[The officer] told me ... if I do jumping jacks he'll be watching: ""Don't do jumping jacks naked 'cause I'll be watching"".' Plaintiff 2 claimed. Vulnerable: One woman claims that, after changing into a jail uniform, she was ordered back into her cell and told to take off her underwear, which was being filmed on camera . iframe code: . Captain Engle has defended the jail however, saying that the video monitoring is legal and appropriate. 'When . you step foot into a correctional institution, your expectation of . privacy is greatly diminished,' said, adding that officers were not . watching the activity on the camera. 'All . of these cases, there are no officers viewing the video or the monitor . at any time through any of these allegations,' he said. The Captain added that an internal investigation had found no evidence of wrongdoing. Almost all complainants were being held on suspected DUI offenses, for which they are typically released in a matter of hours. Earlier this year one female complainant said that, after changing into a jail uniform, a jailer asked her to go back into her cell and remove her underwear. 'What possible security reason could they have ... she's going to hand herself with her panties?' said Seattle attorney James Egan, whose law firm is handling the case. 'She's about to be released and out the door.' Mr Egan has obtained several surveillance tapes from Puyallup city jail through public record requests, which were released to King5. He said the women were unaware their actions were being recorded on a monitor that was watched by mostly male jailers. Attorneys acting on behalf of Puyallup city jail say the camera operations inside the facility are standard practive . One woman from Kings County, who chose not to be identified, was arrested for suspected drunk driving in April and said she refused to change her clothes until a female officer was present because she was comfortable with the four male guards nearby. 'Basically I was harassed for not doing it and put back in the holding cell and made to stay there for about 12 hours,' the woman said. Another woman said there was no reason for her to strip naked. 'I thought maybe it was for seeing if we have contraband of something, but we are already patted down,' she said. 'So then why would there be a camera still?' 'I just didn't feel comfortable with the situation so I wasn't going to do it': This woman, who asked not to be identified, refused to undress on camera after being arrested on suspected drunk driving . Jail experts say such levels surveillance were extremely unusual. Kenneth Burns, an architect who has designed 40 jails, said he was 'stunned' by the recently released videos. 'We do have lots of cameras but (usually) you cannot watch anywhere where someone is using the shower, toilet facilities or a changing area,' Burns told King5. However Puyallup City attorney Kevin Yamamota, speaking on behalf of the jail, said placing cameras in common areas and cells was standard practice and that there are no plans to change such methods. 'The jail videos we've watched so far don't show any inappropriate activity,' Mr Yamamota said.

Mr Piper, from Dumfires, says he can turn off his central heating from September as the bulbs emit so much heat they keep his whole house warm . Mr Piper said: 'Despite having thousands of lights up I find they're cheaper to power than my heating. 'They're about the equivalent of powering a 3kw fire. 'Once the lights are on for a while the place is like a sauna. 'I leave the doors open so the heat circulates through the house. 'Later on in winter, if it's really cold in the morning, I'll put the lights on first thing to warm the place up. Mr Piper, who has thrombosis of the legs and is unable to work, continued: 'I put £15 a week on my electricity key card and £15 a fortnight on my gas card, which pays for my cooker and central heating. Lit up: The man puts around 700 lights on his Christmas tree alone, and thousands more around his house . 'I try to spend only around a fiver on my gas at this time of year and that's just for cooking, allowing the money to build up. 'Once I take the lights down after Christmas there will hopefully be enough on the gas card to pay for my heating into the spring. 'I really don't know how these heating companies expect people on low incomes to survive. For older people, it's heat or eat. 'I stock up two big chest freezers whenever I can so I have emergency supplies of food when needed. 'These days I usually get money for Christmas presents and put it straight on to the meter cards. You just do what you have to do.' Mr Piper said his love of Christmas lights started when he was a young boy. Memories: Mr Piper's love of lights comes from his father only allowing one set on the family's tree . He said: 'My father only allowed one set on the tree and I told myself when I was old enough I would find as many lights as I could and put them up. 'I go around charity shops collecting old sets. I love fiddling with the lights and fixing them. 'I have 700 lights on the Christmas tree alone and thousands more around the room - on the walls, window, hanging from the ceiling. If I could put them on the floor, I would. 'It takes me a couple of days just to get all of the tangles out and then my friend puts them up for me. Until next time: The lights all come down in January, by which time Mr Piper says he has saved enough money on his gas card to last him through until spring . 'Everyone thinks I'm mad but I don't care. The neighbours have come to expect it now. 'My mum stays around the corner and she knows if I'm in because you can see the lights from a distance. 'They put me in a great mood, I love them. I could stare at the lights all year round but I take them down on January 3 - it'd look stupid otherwise.'","Darrel Piper, 40, from Dumfries, puts up thousands of Christmas lights around his home every year on September 1 .

The victims were rushed to Bellevue Hospital suffering from gunshot wounds to the back and leg. Both are expected to survive. The incident happened just after 11pm on the skating rink in the heart of the popular midtown park located at 42nd Street and 5th Avenue. Scroll down for video . Harrowing scene: Twitter user Raghuram Krishnamachari shared this image of paramedics attending to two people who were shot while skating on the ice rink in Bryant Park . Witnesses of the harrowing incident took to Twitter to share their accounts and photos from the crime scene. ‘People just fell on the floor because they heard a gunshot and they had ice skating skates on so they couldn’t run,’ said Raghuram Krishnamachar, 29, of Brooklyn, who was eating dinner with his girlfriend and her family at the park’s second-floor restaurant Celsius. ‘People were scared they didn’t know what was going on,’ he said. Krishnamachar said he heard three shots ring out and saw skaters down below scramble for safety, while one person lay motionless on the rink. He posted a photo of the scene on Twitter. He said restaurant patrons were told to lie on the floor and eventually were ushered to a back room. ‘We didn’t know anything. The shooter could’ve been a lunatic with a machine gun,’ he said. Full house: The free-admission ice rink was teeming with skaters just moments before gunfire erupted . Gunned down: Police say one of the victims was hit in the back while the other was struck in the leg . The suspects in the shooting are reportedly still at large. The New York Daily News said police are on the hunt for a man with dreadlocks and wearing a red hooded sweatshirt. A witness told the New York Times Saturday night that he saw a man skate up to another person in the middle of the rink, pull a gun and open fire. In total, three shots reportedly rang out, sending park goers running for cover, some of them wearing only socks. A young woman believed to be a victim's sister was heard exclaiming, ‘My brother 'just got shot in front of my face.' Christopher Guerrero, 19, said one of the victims was a friend named Adonis, identified by MailOnline as Adonis Mera. Victim: One of the Bryant Park shooting victims has been identified as Adonis Mera . Skating enthusiast: Shortly before the shooting, Mera posted a message on his Facebook page saying that Bryant Park was crowded . Mera's friend who witnessed the shooting said the teen told him he could not feel his legs . According to Mr Guerrero, the teenager told him he could not feel his legs as he was lying on the ice. On his Facebook account, Mera posted a message Friday about his weekend plans: 'Catch me at Bryant Park!!' Shorty before the shooting, the boy wrote on his page that the park was packed with people. Early Sunday morning, Mera's numerous friends and well-wishers took to Twitter to post messages of support for the injured young man. Arelis Marie wrote: 'The fact that people can't go ice skating without someone tryna catch a body is crazy! Pull through Adonis, we're praying for you.'

In the 1970s, Bryant Park, like much of Midtown Manhattan, had been taken over by drug dealers, prostitutes and homeless people and was considered a no-go zone by law-abiding city dwellers. The park went through a massive overhaul in the late 80s, emerging as an exemplary urban green space after a 4-year renovation, which was praised by Time Magazine as a ‘small miracle.’ Manhunt: Police are searching for a suspect with dreadlocks and a red hoodie . Quarantine: Police secured the rink and questioned the park goers before letting them leave . These days, the park is packed with office workers on fair-weather weekdays, tourists and families on the weekends and ice skating enthusiasts during the winter months. In 2005, Bryant Park introduced Citi Pond - a free ice skating rink that became a fixture in the Manhattan holiday scene. It is open until midnight on the weekends.","Three shots rang out at 11pm on the ice in Bryant Park during busy skating session .

Convicted: Charles Masters, 34 (pictured) will spend 25 years behind bars for killing his brother Jordan Masters, 28, with a sword . A 34-year-old man who slayed his younger brother with a samurai sword before lying next to his dead body for four days hoping he would live again has been convicted. Charles Masters will spend 25 years behind bars for the brutal murder of Jordan Masters in their Donelson, Tennessee, apartment on August 12, 2012. The judge acknowledged Masters' 20-year-struggle with mental illness and his remorse but handed down the maximum sentence due to the crime's gruesomeness. During Tuesday's sentencing hearing, Charles testified that he and Jordan, 28, trusted one another more than anyone else. The 'best friends' shared an apartment at the Cedars at Elm Hill complex on Elm Hill Pike, passing the time by playing the Final Fantasy video game together and collecting swords. But despite their alleged close bond, Charles pulled out one of the swords and slashed Jordan at least 16 times and partially severed his head after an altercation, according to WKRN-TV. Charles lay next to his brother's decomposing body on the living room floor for about four days hoping he would come back to life before calling police. 'I wanted my brother back,' Charles said in court. 'I couldn’t accept the fact it was actual reality I was witnessing.' This old family photo shows Charles Masters standing and Jordan Masters (on couch facing camera) playing chess with another family member. The Masters' sister India Whitney posted the image to Facebook . Charles claimed in court he couldn't explain what happened on the night of the murder, describing the few seconds in which he attacked the 'worst . mistake of my life', The Tennessean reported. Charles' attorney, public defender Mike Engle, argued his client's history of severe mental illness should lessen the sentence. However assistant District Attorney Katrin . Miller pushed for the maximum sentence because of how Charles handled . his brother’s body. Charles, who was unemployed, slashed Jordan's body at least 16 times and allowed it to decompose. Judge J. Randall Wyatt, Jr., reportedly said he'd never seen more gruesome images after looking at photos entered into evidence. Family members said they were forced to hold a funeral with an empty casket because Jordan's body was so violated. House of horrors: Charles Masters killed his younger brother in the apartment they shared at the Cedars at Elm Hill complex on Elm Hill Pike in Donelson, Tennessee (pictured) During the hearing, Charles' brother-in-law Jerry Whitney said Charles should have been Jordan’s 'keeper'. 'He was the oldest and bigger brother, and most time bigger brothers, they look out for their younger ones,' he said, according to The Tennessean. 'Watch over them. They’re supposed to protect them and keep their brother safe from harm and hurt. I feel Charlie had a choice to be his brother’s keeper, but he chose not to be.' Jordan had worked at a local . hotel and paid for the apartment where the brothers lived. The mens' sister, India Whitney, did not ask for leniency for her surviving brother. 'I have not had my closure,' she said. 'I don’t ever want to see him again.'

Two studies claim more than one fizzy drink a day increases the risk of diabetes and hypertension . Just two fizzy drinks a day can damage the kidneys, research shows. One study revealed how the type of sugar used in such drinks apparently raises blood salt levels. A second showed that the drinks may cause the kidneys to get rid of too much protein from the body. A hallmark of failing kidneys is called proteinuria – the increased excretion of protein in the urine. It was found in those who had two of the drinks daily in a study at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan. More than 8000 university employees with regular kidneys took part in the experiment. A third abstained from fizzy drinks, another third drank one a day, and the final group had two a day. In a space of just three days, 10.7 per cent of the third group developed proteinuria, and 8.9 per cent of the second group showed similar effects. The first group just showed signs in 8.4 per cent of those tested. Fructose or fruit sugar is used to sweeten soft drinks and researchers for the second study at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland found that it increases the kidneys’ sensitivity to angiotensin II, a protein that regulates salt balance. It means salt is reabsorbed into the kidneys, which could lead to diabetes, obesity, kidney failure, or hypertension. Fructose: Sugary drinks contain fructose, which the study found forces our kidneys to reabsorb salt . Researchers hailed the tests, on rats, as a potential indication of what is causing epidemics of these illnesses. Both studies were presented at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week in Atlanta last week.","Osaka University Graduate School in Japan found drinks raise salt levels .

Whether you're seething with envy because you didn't get a ticket, giddy with delight that you won't be trudging around a farm all weekend, or simply don't care either way, it's impossible to forget about a certain little music festival going on in Somerset this weekend. But those suffering the dreaded Glastenvy can console themselves with the thought of how much cash they'll be saving by not hanging out with the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Arctic Monkeys at Glastonbury. Because before you've even factored in the £210 ticket price, transport costs, sleeping bags - plus the all-important cold cider and hot food money once you're actually at the event - every attendee is likely to spend an average of £200 on festival essentials before they set off. And it's mostly alcohol and fancy dress for the boys, wet wipes and wellies for the girls. It's Glastonbury this weekend, if you hadn't already noticed, and attendees will be packing their bags with over £200 worth of stuff before they even arrive in Somerset, according to new research into festival spending . While the girls grab wet wipes, loo roll, wellies and anti-bacterial hand gel, for the boys, alcohol and fancy dress came top of the list of things to pack for a festival . It seems men pack 'to have a good time' (58 per cent) and women pack 'to be comfortable' (61 per cent) when it comes to attending festivals, according to a new survey. And in terms of what to bring, the essential items found in the backpacks of girls and boys also varies wildly. Alcohol, funny fancy dress, snacks and sex protection came top of the men's 'to buy' lists... while wet wipes, dry shampoo, wellies and anti-bacterial hand gel were the priorities for women. Further ingredients for making a festival complete for male fans are drinking games, outdoor games such as footballs, paracetamol and water. Women, on the other hand, also chose toilet roll, perfume, umbrellas, mirrors, sun lotion and waterproofs. Festival-goers spend £200 each on packing essentials . Anti-bacterial hand gel is crucial to the girls . Women don't like to go without their own loo roll . Attending Glastonbury is no longer a case of hopping over the fence with nothing but the clothes you're wearing and a fiver - these days festival fans arrive laden with alcohol, camping gear, stoves, bicycles, umbrellas and five days-worth of fancy dress . In effort to save money while on site, many people resort to bringing in stashes of alcohol to last them five days, left, and energy drinks to keep them going for the whole festival, right . Respondents were asked how much they spent on items to take along with them, including a tent, and the average festival spend was £230 per person. Ennis Al-Saiegh, marketing director at offeroftheday.co.uk who conducted the research, said: 'It seems that men and women have different views on what's essential when it comes to festival camping. 'Women seem to make the sensible stuff as a priority, but men appear to focus on the good times!' 'It would suggest that there's more of a cavalier attitude amongst the men surveyed. Maybe it's pre-festival exuberance or post-festival nostalgia, but it would be interesting to see if the list changes two days in! Got Glastenvy?

Innocent Palestinian families are being subjected to terrifying night-time raids and mock arrests by the Israeli army without being told they are military exercises, it has emerged. In one drill earlier this year, around 15 soldiers stormed a family's home in the city of Hebron while they were eating their evening meal during Ramadan. Wearing helmets and carrying weapons, they used a ladder to enter activist Issa Amro's property from an upstairs window. 'A violation of basic rights': Troops from the Israeli Defence Force have been carrying out raids and mock arrests on innocent Palestinians without telling them they are military exercises (file picture) They then broke down a neighbour's door before returning to Amro's home for a second exercise in his yard after midnight. In another drill, a number of troops caused alarm and distress in Amatin, in the northern West Bank, after spreading out through the village for several hours. 'From the responses of those to whom we spoke, they were very afraid – especially children and the elderly,' said Emily Schaeffer, a lawyer for Israeli human rights group Yesh Din, which filed complaints about the two incidents to the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF). She said the IDF's conduct was 'an unlawful violation of basic rights'. According to the Guardian, former Israeli soldiers told how civilians with no connection with militant activity were chosen for the drills, with one saying: 'We used houses, streets, people like cardboard practice targets.' Terrifying: In one drill, soldiers caused panic among residents by fanning out through their village for hours . Describing a mock arrest, ex-solder Moran Gonen said: 'You knock on the door, no one opens, you knock harder, the guy comes out, he doesn't understand because there is no reason. 'It's not as if he did anything.' The IDF admitted the training exercise in Hebron had been conducted 'improperly'. The military advocate general is also understood to have called for an internal inquiry by the unit over the incident. Of the drill in Amatin, the IDF said it had been designed to 'acquaint forces more closely with the relevant sector as well as demonstrating IDF presence in the area' . It said it had been carried out to minimise friction with residents. In a letter responding to Yesh Din's complaints, the advocate general said the IDF was 'obliged to maintain security and public order' in the West Bank. 'In order to maintain the competence of IDF forces to carry out that mission, the IDF must train, sometimes even in populated areas,' it adds. But the letter stressed that soldiers 'must avoid endangering the population, causing damage to its property or unreasonably disturbing its living routine'.","Around 15 soldiers raided family while they were eating during Ramadan .

For those too ashamed to admit their favourite tipple is Jacob’s Creek or Blue Nun, fear not – you are not alone. Britons in general do prefer cheaper wines, according to taste tests. Eight out of ten people in the blind test preferred a bottle of wine costing £4.99 to a £19.99 option made from the same grapes. And six in ten thought the £4.99 version was the more expensive of the two. Battle of the bottles: Eight out of 10 people preferred the £4.99 bottle of Aspen Hills Chardonnay, left, compared to the £19.99 bottle of Gerard Thomas St. Aubin 1er Cru, right, in the blind taste tests carried out by the London Wine Academy . The figures, from the London Wine Academy, are sure to challenge conventions about what makes a really good bottle of wine. The academy insists the £19.99 bottle is superior and that it takes some knowledge, tasting and experience to understand why. However, the ordinary consumer might well argue that personal taste is a better judge, while the cheaper option is also more gentle on the pocket. Data was gathered from 20,000 enthusiasts attending courses at the academy over 20 years. Each workshop opened with a blind tasting of two wines from the same grape variety at different prices. Without any instructions on how to taste or what to look for the drinkers were asked to rate the wine on taste and guess the price. The study surveyed 20,000 enthusiasts over a 20-year period . On average, 80 per cent preferred the taste of Aspen Hills Chardonnay from South East Australia, which costs £4.99 from Majestic Wine. They put it ahead of the more expensive Gerard Thomas Saint-Aubin 1er Cru from Burgundy, France, which is £19.99 at Waitrose and Majestic. The academy said the amateur’s perception of a good wine is based on the notion of ‘smoothness’. Cheaper wines from warm climates have lower acidity, higher alcohol content, and have a more simple flavour. Experts, however, look for complex flavours, the balance between them and how long flavours linger, said academy founder Leta Bester. She added: ‘The better, and usually more expensive the wine, the longer this finish will be. The flavours of a £4.99 wine may last for less than 10 seconds whilst a £19.99 wine should linger for nearly a minute.’ Miss Bester said that more expensive wines were not necessarily ‘better’ than cheaper ones, they were just ‘different’ and often needed food to fully bring out the flavour. ‘Initially our students prefer the simplicity of less expensive wines,’ she said. ‘But as their understanding and sense of taste grow they tend to gravitate to pricier wines that display more complexity.’ She said that, contrary to popular belief, no one is born with a good or bad palate and like any discipline tasting is about teaching your body to do new and unfamiliar things. ‘Wine tasting is about developing the lines of communication between your nose, tongue and brain and in novice tasters these lines are relatively underdeveloped,’ she said.","Britons in general prefer cheaper wine, according to taste tests .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:56 EST, 16 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:13 EST, 16 November 2013 . The real name of a 4-year-old girl who was murdered more than 20 years ago but not identified until this year finally has been etched into her tombstone after the girl was known simply as 'Baby Hope' for the last two decades. The body of little Anjelica Castillo has been buried in St. Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx since it was found in a cooler on the side of a highway in New York City's Washington Heights in 1991. Detectives working the case of the then-unidentified body gave the girl the name 'Baby Hope' as they vowed to catch her killer. At a ceremony at the grave site on Friday, Castillo's mother and other family members left flowers and lit candles for the girl, who would now be 26 years old. Identified: A grave that has been marked 'Baby Hope' for the last 22 years now honors the girl who is buried there . Blessing: dozens of people - including police who investigated the case for years - showed up to bless the newly engraved tombstone . 'I'm just glad that her name is on her stone,' the girl's sister, Lorena Castillo, told NBC New York. Father Rudy Gonzalez, who presided over the ceremony, blessed the grave site, telling mourners, 'Bless the engraving of Anjelica's name and bless any child who at this moment may be suffering at the hands of evil hearts.' When Castillo's body was found 22 years ago, detectives determined the girl had been sexually assaulted and suffocated before being put in a cooler and dumped on the side of a highway. 'We couldn't imagine how anybody could be so cruel to such an innocent little child,' retired detective Jerry Giorgio said. For years, Girogio and retired deputy chief Joseph Resnick work feverishly to find 'Baby Hope's' killer, but the case eventually went cold. But authorities never forgot about 'Baby Hope.' In July, the NYPD relaunched its investigation into the girl's murder on the 22nd anniversary of they day her body was found. Cold: After investigating the case for years, leads in the 'Baby Hope' case dried up . Never forgotten: Police reopened the 'Baby Hope' case this year, which led to the discovery of the girl's identity - and her alleged killer . Authorities canvassed the Washington Heights neighborhood with flyers with a sketch of 'Baby hope' in the hopes that it would turn up new leads. And it did. The day after authorities reopened the case, a call came into Crime Stoppers - the NYPD's tip line - from a person who claimed to have information about the case. The caller 'gave specific family members, where to look -- ethnicity, origin, approximate dates of birth, and she turned out to be right,' Detective Elena Donnell said. That tip led to the arrest of 52-year-old Conrado Juarez, a cousin on Anjelica's father's side. Juarez confessed to the murder, but later recanted, saying the confession had been coerced. After admitting to the murder, Juarez gave a jailhouse interview to the New York Times claiming that he didn't actually kill the girl, but he did help dispose of the body. Juarez told the paper that Anjelica and her sister, Maribel, were the children of his uncle and they had been living with him and his sister in their Astoria, Queens, apartment. One day, the girls' father never came home, and Juarez said he and his sister - who has since died - were then tasked with caring for the girls. Monster: Authorities say Castillo's cousin Conrado Juarez sexually assaulted her before suffocating her and leaving her body on the side of a highway . 'Like garbage': Castillo's body was found dumped on the side of a highway inside a cooler . 'I told my sister: ‘'You should get some kind of receipt,’” Juárez said. 'Even if it’s not notarized or formally prepared by a lawyer, get the real mother to sign something. You are going to be the one raising those girls.’ Juarez claims his sister called him one day on his cell phone and told him that Anjelica had fallen down the stairs and that she needed help getting rid of the body. As the Times notes, fewer than three-percent of Americans had cell phones in 1992 - when the alleged murder was committed - and the probability of a poor, immigrant kitchen worker being amongst those with a cell phone is beyond slim, so his account doesn't seem to add up. In his confession, however, authorities say Juarez admitted to things that only the killer would know. Despite his recanting the confession, prosecutors contend that Juarez sexually assaulted the girl in his apartment and then smother her with a pillow when she wouldn't stop crying. He then stuffed her lifeless body into a cooler, took a cab to Washington Heights and dumped the body on the side of the highway. Juarez has since been charged with murder in the girl's death. His next court appearance is scheduled for November 21.","Authorities identified 'Baby Hope' as Anjelica Castillo, who was murdered in 1991 .

Blood pressure drugs that are taken by millions of Britons could raise the risk of potentially deadly kidney problems, doctors fear. A study has linked ACE inhibitors and related pills to sudden renal failure, which is fatal in up to 30 per cent of cases. Researchers at Cambridge University are the first to assess the scale of the problem after concerns about the effects of the medication. At least five millions patients take the tablets, the most popular for high blood pressure, with the number rising each year. The academics compared hospital admissions for sudden kidney failure with prescribing rates for ACE (short for angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and related pills. These showed that between 2007-08 and 2010-11, there was a 52 per cent rise in admissions and a 16 per cent increase in prescriptions for the drugs. The biggest increases in admissions tended be in patients from GP surgeries which had the  largest rise in prescriptions. The researchers said there was ‘strong evidence’ of a link but their project did not prove the drugs were to blame. They stressed that no patients should stop taking their tablets unless advised to do so by their doctor. However, safer prescribing of the drugs could cut kidney disease, and save money and lives, added the study. The academics calculated that 1,636 hospital admissions in the study period could have been avoided if prescriptions had stayed at 2007-08 levels. Kidney doctor Laurie Tomlinson, who co-wrote the report in the journal PLOS ONE, said some patients were anxious about the drugs. ‘I have looked after many with acute kidney injury who were taking these medications prior to becoming unwell and have often worried the drugs were doing more harm than good,’ she said. Lethal: Renal failure is fata in up to 30 per cent of ases . It is thought that the drugs make it more difficult for the kidneys to cope when a stomach bug causes diarrhoea or vomiting. A urine or chest infection may also cause problems. Lead author Dr Rupert Payne advised patients who get a bug to see their GP, who may give them blood tests and temporarily stop their tablets. ‘We are not saying these drugs are dangerous, that would be  inappropriate, because there is clearly evidence they are very helpful to patients,’ he said. Dr Rebecca Sucking, a kidney specialist and adviser to charity Blood Pressure UK, said ‘overall the benefits outweigh the risks’. She added that many trials had shown the drugs ‘increase  survival and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes’. The ACE inhibitors and related pills are given to heart attack patients, diabetics and otherwise healthy people whose high blood pressure puts them at risk of cardiac attacks and strokes. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said the drugs are highly effective and kidney problems are a recognised side-effect.","Popular ACE inhibitor pills have been linked to sudden renal failure .

But when officers in Cumbria carried out a crackdown on sheep rustlers they used the tactic for a very different reason. Instead of lining up people to catch a criminal, officers lined-up around 40 sheep they had recovered in a bid to reunite them with their shepherds. Line-up: Police in Cumbria held an identity parade as part of a crackdown on sheep rustlers . The animals were among 150 ewes recovered following thefts from hill farms across the north Pennines. Six suspected sheep rustlers have been arrested in connection with the thefts in recent months following the joint operation by Cumbria and Durham constabularies. The ewes were worth £100 to £150 each and stolen mainly from Cumbria and Teesdale. PC Roly Earl, from Appleby Neighbourhood Police Team, said: 'Sheep rustling is a problem year after year and the financial blow for farmers is huge.' Farmers have been blamed for some of the thefts. Harry Hutchinson, one of the farmers at the event, said: 'It's a disgrace to the farmers concerned but, to me, it's also a disgrace on the farming community. 'The whole thing is based on trust. You turn sheep on to a common and you expect to get them returned because you trust everyone.'","Police crackdown on rustlers in Cumbria recovers 150 stolen sheep .

A Rhode Island parrot shelter, thought of as a local orphanage for 80 birds, might have to close its doors because the building is slated for demolition.

With affordable space hard to come by, it isn't easy to find enough room to accommodate dozens of the large, loud birds. Raising his voice over the squawks and squeaks of the macaws, parrots and cockatoos, Lazicki says he worries about his flock's future. 'They're my kids,' said Lazicki, 67, an Army veteran and former aerospace machinist who has run the shelter for 17 years. 'They're very intelligent. They need a lot of attention. People often buy a parrot without any idea of what they're getting into.' Lazicki must find a new location for the shelter by Dec. 30 because the current building is destined to be torn down .

Parrot popularity began to soar a few decades ago. The 1970s television show Baretta, whose title character had a cockatoo, is cited as one reason for the surge in popularity.

Investigation: Ian Paterson is accused of botching breast cancer operations on more than 1,000 women . Almost 1,100 women may be at risk due to botched treatment allegedly carried out on them by an NHS surgeon. Dozens of women have already had further treatment after Ian Paterson left small amounts of breast tissue around the cleavage of some of his patients - with the intention of giving them a ‘better cosmetic result’. The scandal is amounting to one of the most expensive for the health service as it faces a multi-million pound legal bill. Around 700 women were believed to have been affected when the surgeon was stopped from operating in July 2011. But it emerged today that a total of 1,079 former patients of Mr Paterson were investigated by the hospital amid fears that he could have carried out more 'cleavage sparing' procedures and put more women at risk. The former consultant of Solihull Hospital in the West Midlands, who also worked privately in the West Midlands, is currently under investigation by medical regulators and the police. Mr Paterson is alleged to have breached national guidelines, which state that leaving tissue after a mastectomy increases the chances of cancer recurring. Every surviving woman who was operated on . by Mr Paterson between 1994 and 2011 has been . warned they need to be re-examined for cancer. One legal firm alone is dealing with the cases of 400 women who were treated by Mr Paterson, according to The Sunday Telegraph. Compensation: Senior medical negligence solicitor Kashmir Uppal with (from left) Paula Gelsthorpe, Victoria Weaver, Rachel Butler, Gail Boichat, Helen Gardiner and Marie Bailey, who are taking legal action against Ian Paterson . Hundreds have contacted other solicitors, while the NHS has settled around ten cases in secret, with £150,000 - to an unidentified woman - being the biggest payout yet. Other payments have been made amounting to around £18,000. West Midlands Police officers have been called in to investigate whether the surgeon committed fraud by carrying out unnecessary private procedures, and whether he benefited financially from them. According to data drawn up by the Cancer Intelligence Network, the official monitoring body, of the women treated by Mr Paterson at Solihull Hospital, 237 were found to definitely have 'excessive breast tissue' left over after their operations. This raised the chances of the disease coming back. Medical notes showed that the 379 women medical notes indicated that it was possible that there was potential for excessive breast tissue. Of the remaining patients, 152 had a complete mastectomy. It is understood that dozens of women have already been received additional treatment which was identified as being needed as their cases were reviewed. Concerns: Staff at Solihull Hospital alerted managers to the conduct of Mr Paterson as early as 2004 but no action was taken for years . Staff at the hospital are said to have alerted managers with concerns about Mr Paterson as early as 2004, but no action was taken until 2007. Mr Paterson — who also worked at two private clinics — Little Aston Hospital in Sutton Coldfield and Parkway Hospital in Solihull — was then told by Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Solihull Hospital, to stop using the 'cleavage sparing' method. But he was allowed to carry on practising until 2011, when he was suspended by both HEFT and Spire. Lynda Johnson, a retired civil servant from Birmingham and a patient referred to Mr Paterson after a breast cancer diagnosis in 2006, said yesterday: 'I thought I had been cured. I thought Mr Paterson had saved my life. So to be told that in fact the cancer could still be there was absolutely devastating.' The 66-year-old, who needed a full mastectomy in July 2010 after discovering that Mr Paterson had only removed part of her breast tissue, said her faith in the health service and medicine has been severely shaken by his behaviour and by that of NHS managers, who failed to stop Mr Paterson operating on hundreds more women. HEFT has admitted liability in her case. The report will be the result of an investigation by Sir Ian Kennedy, who led an inquiry into the scandal of deaths at the Bristol babies’ heart unit. Sir Ian is reviewing hundreds of hours of interviews with NHS staff, including doctors, and with Mr Paterson’s patients. Victim: Marie Pinfield with her sister Shirley Moroney. Marie died 21/10/2008 at the Marie Curie Hospice in Solihull after a botched operation by Mr Paterson . The report is also expected to highlight the pace of re-examinations of the surgeon’s patients. By 2009 only 12 women had been re-examined. A full recall of all his breast cancer patients did not start until June 2011, after Dr Mark Newbold was appointed to take over as new chief executive of HEF. Dr Mark Newbold said: 'I very much regret what has happened to so many women, and our thoughts are with them and their families. We are doing everything we can to offer support through what is a most difficult time for them. 'There is no doubt that mistakes have been made in the past, and this is why since I came into post, have focused on what the patients and staff have been telling us to identify fully what happened and to take every possible action to prevent this from happening again. 'I have requested an independent review led by Sir Ian Kennedy QC. I expect Sir Kennedy’s, report to provide clarity around the specific areas that need to be addressed, and we have committed to this report being made public when it is presented which we believe will be in the next few weeks. We will respond swiftly and positively to Sir Kennedy’s, findings and recommendations. He added that all the women who had had mastectomies had been contacted in writing and that he and other members of the Trust's senior team had met with some of the women concerned and their families. He said a new doctors' revalidation process had also been introduced to look at doctors' performance . An independent review is also being carried out into the way the private firm Spire Healthcare, a private firm, responded to fears over the surgeon’s work. Thompsons Solicitors, the lawyers representing nearly 400 of Mr Paterson’s patients, said Spire launched its review 'only after sustained external pressure'. Incompetent: Two of Mr Paterson's patients, Gail Boichat, left, and Helen Gardiner, right, who were given incomplete surgery . Hundreds of Mr Paterson’s private patients have also been recalled for possible further treatment. Spire Healthcare has commissioned an independent review of how it responded to concerns about Mr Paterson at the private hospitals, which is being carried out by independent consultancy Verita, which is expected to be concluded before the end of the year. A spokesman for Spire Healthcare said: 'Spire Parkway and Little Aston hospitals, in conjunction with the GMC and the HEFT, is continuing to investigate the practice of Ian Paterson. 'Our investigations have revealed some irregularities in his practice that may go against recognised treatment standards. Mr Paterson had his practising privileges suspended by Spire in August 2011. 'Our priority is first and foremost the care and wellbeing of our patients. 'Any patient treated by Ian Paterson who has concerns or questions should call a dedicated phone line, 0800 044 3134, and arrange to speak with our professional medical staff.'","Consultant Ian Paterson's carried out incomplete breast cancer surgery .

Nineteen-year-old Giulia Arena was crowned Miss Italia 2013 in a glittering ceremony – but it was not aired by Italy’s state broadcaster, which dropped it from its schedules for the first time in 25 years. Anna Maria Tarantola, president of the state TV station, RAI, deems the contest – which launched the careers of screen sirens Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida - a sexist anachronism. The final of Miss Italia, which took place at the end of last month, was shown instead by private television network La7, with 900,000 people tuning in. Ceremony: Giulia Arena is crowned with the title of Miss Italia 2013 in Jesolo - but the event wasn't shown on prime-time TV . Living the thigh life: Italian Ambra Battilana, 19, performing during the Miss Italia 2013 contest . Tarantola, 68, believes it’s an event that reinforces a two-dimensional view of women. She told The Guardian: ‘Perhaps here, even if things are changing, which they are, the prevailing image of women [on television] is as housewives, mothers … or as showgirls, that kind of thing.’ She added: ‘A woman must make a name for herself because of her talent, her ability. She must have the opportunity to express her capabilities… Public TV should not, in my opinion, be sending out the message, 'look… you can become someone if you're beautiful'. ‘No, you can become someone if you are committed, know how to value [your] own talent, know how to highlight it, and cultivate it. And then, if you're beautiful, all the better.’ House Speaker Laura Boldrini, of the Left Ecology Freedom party welcomed RAI’s decision saying: ‘This is a civilised and modern choice. Outspoken: Anna Maria Tarantola is fed up with Italian TV portraying women as housewives and showgirls . Anna Maria Tarantola says that the Miss Italia contest sends out the wrong message. Pictured is contestant Martini Silvestri, centre, reacting after advancing to the final of Miss Italia 2006 . ‘We should be delighted that Italian women can now have a chance to make themselves appreciated and valued without parading wearing a number. Only two per cent of women on TV express and opinion and speak. The rest are silent and more often than not semi-dressed.’ But Patrizia Mirigliani, organiser of the show, hit back, saying: ’Maybe the honourable Boldrini does not know that across the country hundreds of local councils are hosting similar events with thousands of young women happily taking part in - neither naked or silently - to acquire that visibility that no other event allows them to in a clean and serious way. ‘These sort of beauty contests have been taking place in the civilised world for years and is not only an appreciation of a woman’s beauty but also gives her the opportunity to express her thoughts and ideas. It does not degrade women and I would love the opportunity to explain that to the honourable Boldrini. Italian actress Sophia Loren waves with finalists for the Miss Italia 2001 beauty contest in Salsomaggiore, Italy. Miss Loren got her 'big break' in the contest . ‘I have been in talks with RAI for several years to try and update the format and bring it more into modern times and we are still in talks at the moment.’ Following the decision to drop the show the Vatican’s official newspaper L’Osservatore Romano said: ’Rather than criticising Miss Italia, it is better to let it fall into the oblivion that it deserves and instead condemn other forms of female manipulation such as the increasing willingness to turn to cosmetic surgery to perfect themselves.’ It also hit out at the Italian TV staple diet of scantily clad women, saying: ’We have enough young ladies in bikinis, we see them on all channels at all hours. Miss Italia has become an old wreck but it was not always like that - after the War it was an opportunity for women to display their natural beauty, humble origins and dressed without the aim of starting a showbusiness career. Political opponents were quick to jump on the bandwagon with Luca D’Alessandro, of Berlusconi’s People of Freedom Party, saying: ’It’s really rather interesting to note that the Speaker of the Lower House has closed the door to Miss Italia but thrown it open to Gay Pride. I am not opposed to any show or rally and in fact the more colourful the better but her decision has the air of racism.’ Gian Marco Centinaio, of the Northern League, said: ’Women have a right to show their beauty. There is nothing scandalous in silent women dressed in bikinis. What would she prefer? Miss Burqa?’ Does she now know that Muslim women are also not allowed to speak to men unless to members of their own family?’ Respected Italian daily Corriere Della Sera said in an editorial: ’If banning Miss Italia from TV makes us feel more modern and civilised as a country then we really are in a bad way.’ The Miss Italia pageant has been blighted in controversy several times with another row in 2007 when judges asked to be allowed to consider the ‘size and shape of a contestant’s bottom’ as part of the selection criteria. Last year the rules of the swimwear section were also changed with competitors asked to wear more sober one-piece outfits in either black or white instead of thigh revealing bikinis.","Anna Maria Tarantola, head of RAI, deems the contest a sexist anachronism .
