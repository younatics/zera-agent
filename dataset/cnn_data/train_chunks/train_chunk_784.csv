A woman who allegedly pocketed £50,000 in disability payments and claimed she was too scared to go outside was in fact working as a tour guide in Argentina while travelling the world, a court heard yesterday. Tracy Johnson, 52, has also been pictured in front of the sprawling salt plains of Argentina in images shown to the jury. In the snaps, from an unknown time, she poses and smiles with a camera at the far-flung locations.

While claiming cash from the taxpayer on . the grounds that she could hardly walk and needed daily care, she even . visited India and New York, where she worked as a travel writer, the . court was told. Johnson said she was a ‘prisoner in her own home’ as she pocketed disability payments for four years. She told the authorities that she spent all day in her bedroom where she felt ‘safe’, and she needed a friend to act as a carer. But instead, she toured the world living a ‘champagne lifestyle’ as a travel writer, as well as running a business as a tour operator in Argentina, a jury was told. She was caught out when investigators tried to contact her about her claims and found she was out of the country. Joanna James, prosecuting, told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court: ‘Tracy Johnson was living the life that honest, decent, hardworking taxpayers could only dream of. ‘While workers were going out to do their daily grind, she was shopping in New York or having a few days in Madrid. ‘She said she was unable to live on a day-to-day basis because she was agoraphobic, suffered depression, hallucinations, anxiety, blackouts and post-traumatic stress disorder. ‘But while submitting claim forms telling the authorities that she was unwell, she was travelling the world on taxpayers’ money.

'It was absolute, blatant dishonesty.’ Miss James said Johnson also claimed she rarely came into contact with other people and was distressed and agitated when she talked of her illness. She added: ‘She said she stumbled and fell repeatedly and could not walk more than five metres without help.’ The court heard how Johnson, of Frome, . Somerset, had changed her address to her mother’s home in Builth Wells, . Powys, for the purpose of claiming benefits. She was arrested when she . tried to renew her benefits claim in June after she returned from India. Miss . James said: ‘In 2012 she decided to use taxpayers’ money to have a . four-month trip around India. When police searched her home, luggage . tags were still on her suitcases.

"By . Suzannah Hills . Tesco staff banned a customer from paying his bill with commemorative £20 coins - and then called police when he didn't have any other cash. Kitchen fitter Brett Chamberlain, 44, filled his car up with £87.49 worth of petrol at a Tesco store in Tiverton, Devon, and then produced five of the special edition £20 coins. But Tesco garage staff refused to accept them, called police when he couldn't produce an alternative payment and then banned him from the premises. Brett Chamberlain, 44, tried to use commemorative £20 coins to pay for his petrol at a Tesco store in Tiverton, Devon, but staff refused to accept them and called police when he couldn't provide another payment method . Barred: Mr Chamberlain was told he was banned from the petrol station after trying to pay with the £20 coins . Staff told Mr Chamberlain they had checked with the company's legal team and could not accept the coins in payment, reports the Mid Devon Gazette. Afterwards, a sign was placed on fuel pumps, stating: 'We are no longer excepting (sic) commemorative coins, ie £20.00 coins. 'Please make sure you have significant funds to pay for your fuel. Sorry for any inconvenience.' In the UK, a person cannot be sued for a debt if they have attempted to pay with legal tender. In England and Wales, £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes are all legal tender for payment of any amount. This is not the case in Scotland or Northern Ireland. But . Royal Mint coins of any amount are legal tender throughout the UK, . meaning a court would see them as an acceptable method of payment, . although a shop doesn't have to accept them. By law, a shop also doesn't have to accept payment in 1p or 2ps for anything over the value of 20p. Launched by the Royal Mint last year, the £20 coins are described on its website as 'official, legal tender'. Although by law, shops and banks do not have to accept large denomination coins, even if they are legal tender. Brett, of Tiverton, said: 'I am not a confrontational person and don't want an argument with anyone. 'But I do feel that it is not right that Tesco should be telling us what coins we can or cannot use as long as they are legal tender.' He kept the £20 coins in his car after ordering a number when they were released. He admitted some people were confused as to why he insisted on using the largely-unknown form of currency, but didn't think he had inconvenienced anyone. Three years ago he had another battle with staff at the same branch when he attempted to pay for fuel with small denomination coins he found with a metal detector. The branch has since confirmed it will now accept the coins. A spokesman said: 'There are so few £20 coins in circulation many of our colleagues are unfamiliar with them. 'We are letting them know they can accept the coins.' The coins are only available online and just 250,000 were minted. They are intended to be a gift for collectors but are legal tender. At just over an inch wide, the coin is slightly larger than a £1 coin and is silver in colour. Change of policy: Supermarket giant Tesco has now agreed that it can accept commemorative £20 coins after Mr Chamberlain complained .

"By . Sara Malm . It can be hard to address the elephant in the room; however it becomes considerably easier when one is standing in your lounge. Staff at a game reserve in Zululand, South Africa found themselves with an unusual problem after a 10-day-old baby elephant ran away from its mother and ended up in their garden. Owner Francoise Maldy Anthony and her colleagues could not believe their eyes when the little explorer then stumbled into her front room. How did she get here? The female baby elephant, named Tom after the member of staff who found her in the garden, was estimated to be just over one week old when it got lost and walked into the living room . New pet: Francoise Malby Anthony, owner of the ranch, plays with her surprise guest in the living room . Lost little one: Francoise Maldy Anthony has owned the Thula Thula Private Game Reserve ranch for 15 years but said she has I have never experienced anything like it . The young female, named Tom after the . ranch’s chef who first discovered the elephant in the garden, is thought . to have travelled around 30 miles before ending up at Thula Thula . Private Game Reserve on Tuesday night. Mrs . Anthony and her staff ensured that the baby elephant had food and water . as rangers headed out on the reserve to track down her mother. Mrs . Anthony, who has owned the reserve for 15 years, said she has never . experienced anything like this – and was shocked to find that the baby . was the calf of an elephant her husband had rescued several years . earlier. ‘She must be like the littlest hobo as baby elephants never ever get lost from their herd. ‘It's . also remarkable that she ended up at my home - we have 4,500 hectares . of land and she was spotted a day before she arrived at my home with her . herd at the other end of the reserve. Tiny dancer: After wandering into the garden, the ten-day-old elephant make its way into the Anthony family's living room . Tom nom nom: Game rangers Shereen Bond and David Bozas feed the distressed baby elephant in an attempt to calm it down while its mother was tracked down . Where's mummy?

Anthony and her staff left Tom the elephant free to roam and were . careful not to have too much contact with the animal, fearing it might . make her mother reject her. ‘Her . mother - who we rescued from a neighbouring reserve which was going to . allow a hunter in to shoot her - was delighted when Tom was finally . reunited with her. ‘I can't say the same for Tom - she must be a bit of a renegade as she tried to run after the van as we pulled away. ‘She was only here for a few hours before we managed to get her back but it was magical. ‘Her herd was monitored overnight to make sure everything was fine and she was accepted back in. ‘It really is a remarkable rescue story. I tried to take photos but couldn't use the flash as I didn't want to startle her. ‘It was a fantastic experience.’ Time for cuddles: David Bozas and Shereen Bond spend some time with the young elephant who temporarily took over the livingroom in the main house on the game reserve . Making friends: Tom the baby elephant and Tom the chef get acquainted in the lounge . One more for dinner then?

He . was an acclaimed conservationist and novelist who wrote a book entitled . 'The Elephant Whisperer: the Extraordinary Story of One Man's Battle to . Save His Herd'. Francoise . added: ‘Some people on Facebook said that it was just too much of a . coincidence that out of the 4,500 hectares available this elephant chose . to make her way to my garden. ‘Lawrence . was famous for the work he did saving elephants and even saved Tom's . mother - people are saying the elephant needed saving and was drawn . here. ‘I don't really know about that but I am sure that she couldn't have spent much longer out there alone. ‘She was very dehydrated and very stressed - she had been walking for an incredibly long time. ‘The . important thing is she is back with her mother and herd and can now . continue with them - unless she decides to wander off again.’ Hard out here: Tom rests her trunk on the sofa after exploring the living room and getting fed .

"By . Marie-louise Olson . It’s a procedure doctors have been using for a long time, but now it’s finally been approved. Botox to treat wrinkles around the corners of the eyes – also known as ‘crow’s feet’ - was officially sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday. Crow's feet are thought to be caused by repeated muscle contractions over a lifetime through facial expressions like frowning, smiling and squinting. 'This additional indication will provide people with a new FDA approved treatment option for those seeking a smoother appearance by temporarily minimising the appearance of crow’s feet at the sides of the eyes,' said Susan Walker, director of the Division of Dermatology and Dental Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in the FDA statement. Approved: Botox can now be legally applied to smooth wrinkles around the eyes . Signs of aging: Botox was first approved as a cosmetic in 2002 for temporary improvement of frown lines - the wrinkles between the eyebrows . Botox has been used for decades by opthalmologists to treat eyelid twitching, or blepharospasm, according to Dr. Jennifer Walden. The Texas-based aesthetic plastic surgeon, told CBSNews.com that this is one of the ways doctors discovered it could smooth the skin. While this new FDA approval for Botox only came Wednesday, Walden said, ‘doctors have been using it off-label for years to smooth the crow's feet’. The new FDA approval came following a study of 833 adults conducted by the drug's manufacturer, Allergan Inc. of Irvine, California, where participants were randomly assigned to receive a Botox or a placebo injection. People treated with Botox had greater reductions in crow's feet. A few celebrities have admitted to using Botox, including the likes of Nicole Kidman, Kim Kardashian, Simon Cowell, Kim Catrall and Sharon Osbourne. Kim Kardashian: 'I’m totally not against plastic surgery. I’ve tried Botox before. That’s the only thing that . I’ve done.' Sharon Osbourne: 'I think that Botox is one of the best things that’s ever been created for cosmetic surgery.' Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) is a protein and neurotoxin and is the most acutely toxic substance known. However, . when injected directly into a muscle in approved doses, Botox prevents . muscles from tightening by temporarily paralysing them, which in turn . makes wrinkles disappear – for up to six months. Botox . was first approved as a cosmetic by the FDA in 2002 for temporary . improvement of frown lines - the wrinkles between the eyebrows, also . known as glabellar lines. The most common side effect seen was eyelid edema, which causes the eyelids to become swollen due to fluid buildup. Nicole Kidman says she no longer uses Botox: 'I . didn’t like how my face looked afterwards. Now I don’t use it anymore – I . can move my forehead again.' Kim Catrall: 'I have a big crease between my eyebrows and I use Botox to get rid of . that, but that’s kind of it. I’m 51 and I think I look my age, but I . don’t want to be 20 anymore or even 30 or 40'. Simon Cowell: 'I've had Botox, but then again pretty much everyone I know has. To me, Botox is no more unusual than toothpaste. It works. You do it once a year, who cares?' Botox labels contain the strongest warning the FDA offers saying the effects of the toxin may spread from the area of injection to other areas of the body. However the FDA said there has never been a confirmed serious case of this happening when Botox is used at recommended doses. According to Dr Marco Harmaty, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at The Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, Botox has been frequently used for crow's feet and other unapproved areas of the face, like the side of the nose. The FDA's new approval ‘does give you an added benefit and safety of saying that I'm not doing anything illegal or potentially harmful’, he said to CBSNews.com. Botox for cosmetic purposes still likely won't be covered by insurers, given it is used for cosmetic purposes. Insurers often cover people who have approved medical conditions treated by Botox, including chronic migraines, severe underarm sweating and others.","Crow's feet are the wrinkles around the corners of the eyes .

"By . Chris Brooke . A girl of three died of dehydration after a locum doctor in a casualty unit sent her home without doing basic tests that would have saved her life, an inquest was told. Mylee Ward should have been admitted to hospital and given fluids after being sick and barely able to eat or drink for three days. Instead the doctor, who had treated a large number of children that week with sickness bugs, sent the youngster home with antibiotics. Failings: Mylee Ward of dehydration after a doctor failed to carry out basic tests after she was rushed to hospital by paramedics . Around 36 hours later, her mother . Terrina-Ann Laughton and father Kevin Ward were considering taking her . back to hospital when she found the youngster unconscious in her . playpen. ‘I was hysterical,’ she said. ‘We lay her flat on the floor but could not get any response.’ A doctor called to the family home in Chesterfield pronounced the girl . dead. In a narrative verdict, coroner Robert Hunter ruled that Mylee . died due to dehydration contributed to by neglect. He criticised Dr Mushfikur Rahman for his failure to treat the girl properly. The coroner told the inquest in Chesterfield: ‘Had she been admitted and fluids given, on balance she would have survived.’ The child was taken to Chesterfield Royal Hospital in March last year after being seen by a  paramedic at home. Mylee was laid across two chairs, instead of being found a trolley, and . examined by Dr Rahman, who should have carried out a simple blood or . urine test to check for dehydration. ‘These are basic medical checks, . nothing complex or sophisticated,’ said the coroner. Dr Rahman, who sent Mylee home at 1am, admitted there were ‘lots of things he missed’. Mylee, who was born with brain damage and was unable to walk or talk, . was described by her mother as a ‘happy, cheerful, giggly little girl’. Fatal mistake: Mylee was taken to Chesterfield Royal Hospital but once there after being laid across the two chairs Dr Rahman 'failed to carry out basic bedside tests,' said the coroner . After the hearing, Miss Laughton, 39, . who has four other children, said she had received no apology or contact . from the hospital. Asked about Dr Rahman, she said: ‘I think every day that if he had done . his job properly Mylee would still be alive.’ A spokesman for the . hospital said the doctor had not worked there since Mylee’s death and . concerns had been passed to the agency that supplied him. He said the hospital wanted to pass on ‘our sincere and unreserved apologies’ that aspects of the girl’s treatment ‘were poor’.

"By . Charles Sale . The manuscript of Joey Barton’s long-awaited autobiography has been delivered to publishers Michael Joseph ahead of an August launch. The Barton life story had been due for release in spring 2013 but was delayed for more than a year because the QPR midfielder was allegedly not satisfied with the chapters written by his first ghost writer, award-winning sports journalist Matthew Syed. This is despite Barton tweeting to his 2.46million followers how much he enjoyed book meetings with his ‘friend’ Syed, a former British No 1 table tennis player and an expert on the psychology of sport.

Lineker called it ‘scurrilous nonsense’, adding: ‘I had a good look in my closet and only found a few packets of crisps.’ Michael Joseph said only the book would not disappoint while Syed couldn’t comment for ‘contractual reasons.’ Staying out of it: Gary Lineker has already slammed some of the accusations in the book .

"By . Phil Duncan . Lewis Hamilton cemented his status as one of the brightest grand prix stars to emerge from these isles after equalling a long-standing record posted by arguably Britain's finest ever driver. In securing his 33rd career pole during Saturday's rain-hit qualifying session for the Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton matched the great Jim Clark's British record. It is a tally that has stood for almost half-a-century, with Clark claiming the final pole of his career in his final grand prix appearance at the 1968 season opener in South Africa. The Scot was killed in a devastating Formula Two crash at Hockenheim only three months later. VIDEO Scroll down to watch videos of Lewis Hamilton, Daniel Ricciardo and Sebastian Vettel . Back-to-back: Lewis Hamilton matched Jim Clark's record after secyuring his 33rd career pole in Malaysia . In black and white: Clark won the 1963 and 1965 Formula One titles . Clark reached 33 poles in just 73 appearances during a career in which he won two world titles. It took Hamilton 131 races to reach the landmark. The 29-year-old racer is now fourth on the all-time list with only Sebastian Vettel (45), Ayrton Senna (65) and Michael Schumacher (68) ahead of him. A furious Daniel Ricciardo vowed to 'have a word' with Valterri Bottas after accusing the Williams man – in no uncertain terms – of blocking him during qualifying. Ricciardo, who was disqualified from the season opener in Australia following a fuel-sensor issue, roared over the team radio: 'get this f****** Williams out of my way'. The Aussie's foul-mouthed rant goes against his rather pleasant off-track demeanour where we have become accustomed to seeing him boast the widest smile in the sport. But the race stewards were quick to side with the Red Bull driver dishing out a three-place gird penalty for Bottas who will subsequently start in a lowly 18th. It is the Finn's second penalty points of the year. Ten more over the next year will result in a one-race ban. In action: Daniel Ricciardo, who was disqualified from the Australian Grand Prix, will start from fifth on Sunday . Dreamy: Hamilton posted this picture after qualifying . Drivers are being forced to keep their weight down to an absolute minimum following the overhaul in regulations this season. Before jetting to Australia, Jenson Button told MailOnline that he will visit a sauna before each qualifying session, while Nico Rosberg wrote in his column for this website that he has been forced to cut out all sugars from his diet. And his team-mate Hamilton summed up the mood after qualifying when he posted a picture staring at a container full of biscuits before writing 'If only…' On a more serious note, Martin Brundle claimed during his commentary for Sky Sports, that a driver, who he didn't wish to name, fainted at a PR event last week directly as a result of his enforced diet. Next year the weight limit will be increased, but in light of such alarming stories, perhaps there should be a serious case to change the ruling this season. Incredibly Sebastian Vettel was only 0.055seconds away from stopping Hamilton from clinching pole. Mercedes have looked very strong all weekend – they were one second-a-lap quicker than the rest of the field in final practice. But to his and Red Bull's credit - albeit in damp conditions, Vettel managed to split the duo during qualifying. Even the four-time world champion appeared surprised by the miniscule margin separating he and his rival, giving Hamilton a playful shove in parc ferme after seeing their respective lap times. Shake on it: Sebastian Vettel congratulates Hamilton after qualifying for the Malaysian Grand Prix . Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch enjoyed somewhat of a paddock tour on Saturday popping up in the Williams, Ferrari and Mercedes garages just minutes before qualifying. The British actor was a big hit with the drivers, too, sharing time with Felipe Massa and Nico Rosberg. Former AC Milan and Chelsea star Ruud Gullit was also seen in the Ferrari garage while Button's fiancée Jessica Michibata donned the Italian team's colours as she watched her future husband qualify 10th after his gamble to take to the track on intermediate tyres backfired. Centre of attention: Benedict Cumberbatch is interviewed outside the Ferrari garage and Jessica Michibata cheers on Jenson Button, who will start tomorrow's race from 10th .","Lewis Hamilton joins Jim Clark on all-time list with 33 career poles .

"By . Ap  Reporter . A computer glitch could help smokers get affordable coverage through Obamacare next year despite a rule allowing insurance companies to charge them much more than non-smokers. In yet another delay for the health care overhaul, the Obama administration has quietly notified insurers that the system glitch will limit penalties insurers are allowed to charge. The glitch, which will take at least a year to fix, is more likely to benefit older smokers. Oops: The Obama administration says a computer glitch may help smokers, especially those 60 and over, skirt insurance premium penalties under Obamacare . However, younger smokers could wind up facing higher penalties than they otherwise would have. A June 28 Health and Human Services Department document couched the smokers' glitch in technical language: . ‘Because of a system limitation ... the system currently cannot process a premium for a 65-year-old smoker that is...more than three times the premium of a 21-year-old smoker,’ the industry guidance said. If an insurer tries to charge more, ‘the submission of the (insurer) will be rejected by the system,’ it added. Starting in 2014, the law requires insurance companies to accept all applicants regardless of pre-existing medical problems. But it also allows them to charge smokers up to 50 percent higher premiums, a way for insurers to ward off bad risks. Not for everyone: While older smokers may benefit, younger smokers could pay more than they otherwise would have if insurers respond to the glitch with a blanket fix . For an older smoker, the cost of the full penalty could be prohibitive. Premiums for a standard ‘silver’ insurance plan would be about $9,000 a year for a 64-year-old non-smoker, according to the online Kaiser Health Reform Subsidy Calculator. That's before any tax credits, available on a sliding scale based on income. For a smoker of the same age, the full 50 percent penalty would add more than $4,500 to the cost of the policy, bringing it to nearly $13,600. And tax credits can't be used to offset the penalty. The underlying reason for the glitch is another provision in the health care law that says insurers can't charge older customers more than three times what they charge the youngest adults in the pool. The government's computer system has been unable to accommodate the two. So younger smokers and older smokers must be charged the same penalty, or the system will kick it out. That's not what insurers had expected. Slow: The Obama administration announced the glitch in late June, saying it will take at least a year to fix . Before the glitch popped up, experts said the companies would probably charge lower penalties for younger smokers, and higher penalties for older ones. ‘Generally, a 20-year-old who smokes probably doesn't have much higher health costs than someone who doesn't smoke in any given year,’ said Larry Levitt, an insurance market expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ‘A 60-year-old is another story.’ The administration is suggesting that insurers limit the penalties across all age groups. The HHS guidance document used the example of a 20 percent penalty. In that case the premium for a 64-year-old would be about $10,900, a significant cut from the $13,600 if insurers charged the full penalty. It's unclear what insurance companies will do. A spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the main industry trade group, said insurers were aware of the issue and expected the administration would fix it eventually. Another workaround for the companies would be to charge the full penalty to both younger and older smokers. In that case, there wouldn't be any savings for older smokers, and younger ones would see a big price shock. Roll out: The Obamacare health insurance markets, in which the uninsured will be able to buy health plans, are set to roll out October 1 despite a string of delays . Levitt said he suspects insurers would keep the penalties low to sign up more young people. Laszweski said he thought they would do the opposite. ‘It's going to throw cold water on efforts to get younger people to sign up,’ he said. Workers covered through job-based health plans would be able to avoid tobacco penalties by joining smoking cessation programs, because employer plans operate under different rules. But experts say that option is not guaranteed to smokers trying to purchase coverage individually. Some see an emerging pattern of last-minute switches and delays as . the administration scrambles to prepare the October 1 launch of the new . health insurance markets. People who don't have coverage on the . job will be able to shop for private insurance, with tax credits to help . pay premiums. Small businesses will have their own insurance markets. Last . week, the White House unexpectedly announced a one-year postponement of . a major provision in the law that requires larger employers to offer . coverage or face fines. Officials cited the complexity of the . requirement as well as a desire to address complaints from employers. ‘This . was an administration that was telling us everything was under . control,’ health care industry consultant Robert Laszewski said. ‘Everything was going to be fine. Suddenly this kind of stuff is . cropping up every few days.’","Older smokers likely to benefit, saving around $4,500 per year .

"By . Sara Malm . Somali militants with links to al-Qaeda today posted sickening photographs of what they claim is a French soldier killed in Saturday's failed rescue mission of a fellow countryman held hostage. Three pictures posted on Twitter show a white man wearing military pants and a blood-soaked shirt surrounded by three guns, ammunition clips and protective gear. Militant Islamist group al-Shabab taunt the dead man's religion in their posts writing 'A return of the crusades, but the cross could not save him from the sword,’ and asking president Francois Hollande if it was 'worth it'. Gruesome: Somali militia al-Shabab tweeted this picture, which we have pixilated out of decency, and two more of . what they says is a soldier killed in attempt to free a French . intelligence officer held hostage . The soldier was killed during a failed military raid to rescue a French intelligence . officer who had been held by al-Shabab, the al-Qaida-affiliated militant group that . controls much of southern Somalia, since July 2009. French special forces arrived in the . village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, to free Denis Allex, . the pseudonym for a secret agent who was captured while working for France’s overseas intelligence agency . DGSE. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le . Drian said Monday that it was likely the two commandos were killed . during the raid. France believes Denis . Allex, was also killed. Mr Le Drian appeared to predict the . release of the pictures, saying several hours before the posting that . France believed al-Shabab was preparing a ‘macabre and disgraceful’ display of the dead soldiers' bodies, although only one body has been pictured so far. Rescue bid: The soldier was killed in a failed attempt to rescue French secret agent Denis Allex, pictured in an al-Shabab video, who reportedly also died, although al-Shabab insists he is still alive . French special forces arrived in the village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, in the early hours of Saturday January 12 . In addition to the Twitter postings, . al-Shabab released a longer statement that appeared to mix exaggerated . boasts with fact. The group said that the operation resulted in the . deaths of ‘several’ French forces and injured ‘many more.’ The militants . said the commander leading the operation was among those wounded, and . that al-Shabab ‘paramedic teams’ transferred him to a hospital where he . died. Despite French claims about Mr . Allex being killed, al-Shabab insisted he was still alive – and had not . even been in the village. It was formed as a radical offshoot of the Union of Islamic Courts in 2006. Affiliated to al-Qaeda, it controls large swathes of south and central Somalia and in 2010 it was responsible for the deaths of 76 people in a double attack in Uganda during 2010 football World Cup. It is estimated to have 7,000 to 9,000 fighters. al-Shabab means 'The Youth' in Arabic. The group also said a decision had . been reached concerning the fate of Allex. It said that decision would . be announced in coming hours. Transported by helicopters, the French . commandos attacked the al-Shabab position early Saturday in an attempt . to free Allex. Le Drian said the government decided to stage the rescue a . month ago, when Allex's location seemed to have settled down ‘in a spot . accessible by the sea.’ U.S. military aircraft briefly entered Somali . airspace to support the rescue operation, President Barack Obama said . Sunday, but did not employ their weapons. Fierce fighting broke out after the French troops landed. French officials said they counted 17 dead among the Islamists. Taunting: A member of militant islamist group Al Shabab, which controls much of southern Somalia (file photo) Al-Shabab once controlled all of . south-central Somali, including the capital, Mogadishu.

The failed raid came just a few hours . after France began a military operation in Mali to assist the government . there against encroaching rebels linked to Al Qaeda. However, Mr Le Drian insisted that the . Somalia raid was nothing to do with Mali after rumour spread that the rescue mission was carried out following fears that Mr . Allex would be executed in an act of revenge. President Francois .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Tiger Woods will miss the Masters next week and could be out for the rest of the summer as well after undergoing surgery for a herniated disc on Monday. The 38-year-old revealed the stunning news in a statement on his website that not only ruled him out of Augusta but cast grave doubt on his participation for the US Open in June and also the season’s other two majors as well. ‘After attempting to get ready for the Masters and failing to make the necessary progress I decided, in consultation with my doctors, to have this procedure done,’ said Woods. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tiger Woods appear in funny TV advert . Absent: Tiger Woods will miss the Masters due to a back injury and could not tee it up at any of this season's majors . Questions being asked: Woods has endured a frustrating season up to now . Ouch: Woods grimaces in pain after playing a bunker shot during the World Golf Championships at Doral . Ruled out: Woods will miss the Masters after undergoing back surgery . Masters: 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 . The Open: 2000, 2002, 2008 . US Open: 2000, 2002, 2008 . US PGA Championship: 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007 . ‘This is frustrating but it is . something my doctors advised me to do for my immediate and long-term . health. It looks like I will be forced to miss several upcoming . tournaments to focus on my rehabilitation.’ This will be the first time Woods has . missed the Masters since he competed as an amateur in 1995. He has been . struggling on and off with his back since last August. He withdrew from . the Honda Classic at the beginning of last month with five holes to play . and was clearly still in pain at the Cadillac Championship. That . was three weeks ago, during which time he had hoped rest and intense . physio would do the trick. That all ended on Monday with microdiscectomy . surgery in Park City, Utah. Woods is hoping to be back chipping . and putting by the end of this month but even if that happened he would . still be a long way from being able to swing a driver, and a return to . competition. Where it all began: Woods receives the Masters green jacket from 1996 winner Nick Faldo in 1997 . Rory McIlroy - 15/2 . Adam Scott - 8/1 . Phil Mickelson - 14/1 . Jason Day - 18/1 . Dustin Johnson - 20/1 . Odds provided by Coral . The recovery period is listed as two to three months . before someone can usually think about putting stress on the back, which . would clearly leave him in a race against time to be ready for the . summer programme. Then there’s the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in . September. To play in that, he would almost certainly need a wild card . and while captain Tom Watson would be happy to hand him one if he has . fully recovered, would a man who has undergone such a delicate operation . really want to risk being on a course in cold conditions in the heat of . competition for 12 hours a day? A bad back is the dread of every . golfer. The surgery was described as successful on Woods’s website but . the truth is there is no guarantee it will work when it comes to . practising for hours at a time. The specialist nature of the surgery and . the fact this could prove career-defining was underlined by the fact he . had the operation done 2,000 miles from his home in Florida. Unsteady: Woods injured his Achilles after playing from under the Eisenhower tree at the 2011 Masters . Crocked: Woods withdrew from the Players in 2011 after nine holes, left and the American played through the pain barrier on his way to winning the 2008 US Open . Carted off: Woods is driven off the course after picking up a neck injury at the Players in 2010 . Red alert: Woods has been plagued with back problems in recent events . US Open: June 12-15 . The Open: July 17-20 . US PGA Championship: August 7-10 . Whatever the outcome, this is unquestionably another massive blow for . the world No 1, who was the most impressive athlete the sport had . ever seen in his twenties  but who has been blighted by one injury after . another in his thirties. The most serious came in 2008, when he . tore his anterior cruciate knee ligament and was out for eight months. He has also withdrawn from events owing to a damaged achilles and a bad . neck. This was supposed to be the year when Woods got back on the . majors trail after a drought stretching back six years. Three of the . majors are being staged at venues where he has won while the fourth, the . US Open, is at Pinehurst where he finished runner-up in 2005 and third . in 1999. Now his hopes for the year are up in the air and the . long-term looks more uncertain than ever. ‘It’s tough right now, but . I’m absolutely optimistic about the future,’ said a defiant Woods, as he . contemplated the two great goals of his professional life – surpassing . Sam Snead’s all-time record of 82 PGA Tour wins and Jack Nicklaus’s . total of 18 majors. Racking up the green: Woods won the Masters in 2005 . Last triumph: Woods stands with runner-up Rocco Mediate after winning the US Open in 2008 after a play-off at Torrey Pines . Nice fit: Woods adjusts the Masters green jacket in 2002 after his win at Augusta . Silver service: Woods looks at the British Open trophy after his win in 2005 . Triple crown: Woods celebrates winning his third Open title in 2006 . Major force: Woods holds up the US Open trophy after his win in 2000, left, and 2002 . While this injury would have to be virtually . career-ending for Woods not to overtake Snead – he has 79 victories to . his point – the number posted by the Golden Bear has never looked more . out of reach since the day Tiger turned up at Augusta in 1997 and won . his first major by 12 shots. It had all looked set up perfectly . for this season, too. Woods has played 65 majors and won 14 – exactly . the same figures managed by Nicklaus at the same age. Now Woods needs to . win either the US Open or the Open to keep pace but will he even get . the chance? Naturally, Woods isn’t remotely thinking of giving up . the fight. ‘There are a couple of records by two outstanding individuals . that I hope one day to break,’ he said. ‘As I’ve said many times, Sam . and Jack reached their milestones over an entire career. I plan to have a . lot of years left in mine.’ It was a rare note of optimism on a grim day not only for Woods but the sport itself. June 2008: In obvious discomfort Woods plays through the pain to win the US Open at Torrey pines. Days later he undergoes anterior cruciate ligament surgery on his left knee while cartilage damage is also repaired. It later emerges he had also suffered a double stress fracture in his left tibia while preparing for the tournament.

August 2009: Woods, below, wins his 70th PGA event, finishing four shots ahead of Padraig Harrington and Robert Allenby in the WGC Bridgestone Invitational. November 2009: Two days after a story breaks claiming Wood's had been unfaithful to wife Elin Nordegren, Woods hits the headlines after ploughing his Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his home in Isleworth, Florida. Initial reports claim that Woods was in a serious condition and his wife had used a golf club to smash the window of the car before dragging him clear. December 2009: After a second woman comes forward claiming to have had an affair with Woods he admits to 'transgressions'. In the ensuing days more women claim to affairs with Woods prompting him release a statement on his website revealing he is to take 'indefinite leave' from golf to repair his marriage. Sponsors Accenture and AT&T announce they are severing their ties with Woods. February 2010: Woods holds a press conference where he apologises for his 'irresponsible and selfish behaviour' and reveals he is undergoing therapy for the 'issues I am facing'. He does not confirm when he will make his golfing comeback. March 2010: In a press statement Woods announces he will make a comeback at the Masters the following month. April 2010: Woods' return at Augusta see him finish tied for fourth as Phil Mickelson wins the coveted green jacket. May 2010: Having missed the cut the previous week at the Wells Fargo Championship, Woods withdraws during the final round of The Players Championship citing a neck injury. August 2010: Woods and Nordegren are present at the Florida court as their divorce is finalised. April 2011: Woods withdraws from the Wells Fargo Championship on precautionary grounds after suffering a minor injury to his left knee and Achilles tendon during the Masters earlier in the month. May 2011: Woods withdraws from the Players Championship for the second year running, this time after just nine holes after recurrence of the ligament problems in his left knee and left Achilles tendon. Woods does not play again until August after missing both the US and British Open. March 2012: The Achilles problem flairs up once more as Woods withdraws seven holes from the end of the WGC Cadillac Championship, although he is victorious at the Arnold Palmer Invitational a fortnight later. June 2013: Following a lowly finish at the US Open, Woods, below, reveals he has been advised to 'take a few weeks off' to undergo treatment on a strain to his left elbow. August 2013: Woods collapses to his knees in pain, clutching his back on the 13th hole of The Barclays in New Jersey. He recovers to finish second. March 2014: After shooting a five over par 40 on the front nine, Woods withdraws during the final round of the Honda Classic as the backs spasms return to plague him. April 2014: Woods reveals he has undergone surgery to repair a pinched nerve in his back and as a consequence will miss The Masters for the first time in his professional career.

Fashion designer: Frankie Essex, who found fame as Joey's sister on TOWIE, has designed a range of party dresses (£75) Frankie has created her 11 pieces with both her own style and a woman's silhouette in mind. 'I am known for wearing bandage dresses and I get a lot of tweets about them so this collection is definitely me. 'The reason I wanted to have these styles is because I am a curvy girl and they accentuate your curves. 'If you aren't massively curvy it will help you achieve the ""curvalicious"" look. I am hoping all girls will look and feel good in my clothes,' she said. There's a red plunge-neck dress, grey tunic style design and rainbow print bodycons, which Frankie hopes will flatter all body types. Star style: Frankie thinks her dresses (left, £75) would look great on Kim Kardashian and has even offered the star (right) one of her designs . Beauty aficionado: Frankie says she has toned down her look since her early TOWIE days but still couldn't live without her make-up bag . Speaking about her personal style and how she was influenced by her late mother, she said: 'My style is very classic. My mum was a very stylish woman and she always read Vogue. 'When I first started on TOWIE I used to wear very heavy make-up but I have calmed that down as I suit natural so I suppose my clothes reflect that.' Despite her new natural look, Frankie couldn't live without her make-up bag. 'My make-up bag is my life! If I . lost it I would be fuming and cry. My main items are lipgloss, foundation and blusher. That’s all I need.' Frankie is just one of the many TOWIE girls to unveil a clothing collection, so is it competitive between the designers of Romford? High fashion: 'Speaking about her personal style and how she was influenced by her late mother, she said: 'My style is very classic. My mum was a very stylish woman and she always read Vogue' (jumpsuit, £45) 'We have similar dress sense and we . all love clothes. I would love to see some of the girls in my brand. I . wear Cara Kilbey's collection as we are really good friends and have a similar style.' Frankie is currently coveting Sam Faiers' look and says the blonde is looking 'beautiful' lately. As for the boys of Essex, she reckons Diags is dressing 'really nicely' and maintains that she'd never change her brother Joey's 'individual' style because he 'always looks great'. Flattering: There's a red plunge-neck dress, grey tunic style design (£35) and hot pink reversible playsuits (£35), which Frankie hopes will flatter all body types . Speaking about her style icon, Frankie said: 'It would be a cross between Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian with a hint of Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City. 'Victoria Beckham has the smart classy look, Kim Kardashian has the curves and Carrie Bradshaw is a girly dresser and she loves shoes like me.' Since leaving the ITV2 show, Frankie has already set her sights on a fashion and beauty empire. 'I am concentrating on my businesses. As well as the dresses I have a hair company called Frankie Essex Hair and it's just over a year old. 'I have some other exciting news coming out this week so watch this space.'

"By . Reuters . and Daily Mail Reporter . Training for U.S. Navy SEALs, the special operations force, follows a warrior tradition that harkens back to Samurais, but fitness experts say the tough regime is gaining popularity with entrepreneurs, corporate executives, lawyers, elite athletes and women. The workout, geared toward mental as well as physical transformation, is so demanding that the casual gym-goer looking to shed ten pounds before swimsuit season need not apply. 'We look at training as being as important to our life as eating and sleeping,' said retired Navy SEAL commander and fitness instructor Mark Divine, the author of 8 Weeks to SEALFIT: a Navy Seal’s Guide to Unconventional Training for Physical and Mental Toughness. Grueling Actress Demi Moore seen in the 1997 film G.I. Jane, where she underwent Navy SEAL training . SEALFIT draws on the varied, high-intensity interval training of CrossFit, Olympic weightlifting, plyometrics, powerlifting, gymnastics, calisthenics, strongman exercises, yoga, and martial arts. 'CrossFit is baked into the SEALFIT model,' said Divine, 'but our workouts are much longer: two hours if you go through the whole thing.' Divine believes if you lean into hard work it becomes enjoyable, even transformational, although he admits the rigorous type of training has become rare in modern society. Along with first responders, extreme athletes and special ops candidates, Divine’s training site outside San Diego, California, attracts entrepreneurs and executives. 'I’m a strong woman, but this was a step out of my comfort zone . . . It wasn’t just stepping in and out of the gym' About 20 to 30per cent of his clients . are women, no doubt somewhat inspired by the 1997 film G.I., in which . actress Demi Moore underwent rigorous SEAL training. Breathing exercises, concentration drills and visualization exercises are as crucial as physical prowess to Divine, who is trained in Ashtanga, a rigorous form of yoga, and in martial arts. Working in as well as working out, he said, cultivates the warrior spirit, or kokoro, a Japanese word he defines as the merging of heart and mind in action. The SEALs are exposed to all sorts of weather conditions during their training. Girl power: About 20 to 30per cent of the SEALFIT clients are women . Put to the test: Training for U.S. Navy SEALs, the special operations force, follows a warrior tradition that harkens back to Samurais . Danielle Gordon, a 35-year-old sales . representative and an endurance cyclist for many years, admits to . finding the SEALFIT training initially intimidating, even as she was . drawn to the community of local surfers, triathletes, military people . and professionals. 'I’m a strong woman, but this was a step out of my comfort zone,' said Gordon, 'It wasn’t just stepping in and out of the gym.' She said the training, often for hours a day, was transformative for body and mind. 'My strength has changed; my speed has changed. I can pedal harder, cycle harder,' she said. 'I might not be fastest (or) strongest but I know I can do anything.' Tried and tested: The new SEAL workout, geared toward mental as well as physical transformation . Neal Pire, a sports conditioning expert with the American College of Sports Medicine, said high-intensity, performance-oriented training can be powerfully motivating, but people need to be mentally ready to be able to do it, and to do it faithfully. He cautioned that the 'go faster, go harder, go home mentality' can put the un-coached and unprepared at risk for injury. 'The data out about CrossFit does show that an inordinate number of people have injured themselves. 'I equate it to people that have no business performing like an athlete, actually performing like an athlete,' he said. Divine writes in his book that the SEALs have a saying: 'We do today what others won’t, so tomorrow we’ll do what others can’t.' Pire says it’s all about goals. 'Most people are not going to be thrown into battle.' he said. 'If your goal is to lower your blood pressure, fit into that little black dress or look good for a girl . . . Do you need this?'",8 Weeks to SEALFIT is a new fitness book that features the 'ground-breaking training regimens' practiced by Navy SEALs .

Not obliged: Unlike with food, drinks firms are not obliged to state the amount of sugar or other ingredients on their labels . 'But it . is clearly better to choose the option with the least amount of sugar, . as the evidence for added sugar being the number one health villain in . the diet grows ever stronger. ‘Evidence . shows that a moderate amount of red wine, which is comparatively low in . sugar, may actually protect against cardiovascular disease and this is . my drink of choice.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A two-year-old boy saved his mother’s life by managing to call 999 when she collapsed, telling operators:  'Mummy’s on the floor!' Despite only just learning to talk, Riley Ward called 999 and managed to tell operators his mother Dana Henry had collapsed. Paramedics rushed to their home in Barrow Upon Soar, Leicestershire, where they discovered Ms Henry who had to be rushed to hospital for emergency surgery for a blood clot. Scroll down for video . Hero: Despite only just learning to talk, Riley Ward called 999 and managed to tell operators his mother Dana Henry had collapsed. They are pictured with the first paramedic on the scene, Paul Staples . Riley took the initiative to ring for help when his 27-year-old mother collapsed at home just before 11.30 am on February 5. Ms Henry had woken up with stomach pains and fell to the floor after making a cup of tea. At 11.31am, Riley rang 999 and said: 'Mummy’s asleep,' after which the call was passed to the ambulance service who managed to trace the address. Riley repeatedly said ‘hello’ and kept operators on the line, trying to explain that his mum was on the floor. Ms Henry later had emergency surgery at Leicester Royal Infirmary where doctors discovered a large blood clot and dangerous bleed on her ovary. Riley is now being rewarded with an award for his brave actions by East Midlands Ambulance Service who believe he is their youngest ever caller. Brave: Riley called 999 and said: 'Mummy's asleep,' after which the call was passed to the ambulance service who managed to trace the address . His mother said: 'I am so proud of Riley. He is mummy’s little hero. I have told so many of my friends and family about what he did. 'My friends who have young children are so amazed, and are making sure their children would know what to do. 'All I remember from when it happened is the room getting smaller and smaller and then I opened my eyes when I heard a police officer trying to kick my door down.' 'Riley was sat on his toy box looking out of the window at the flashing blue lights. I managed to get to the door, but collapsed again.” 'When the surgeon came to see me the next day, she said she had never seen anything like it. 'I would never have rung 999 - I would have kept taking pain killers and hoping it would go away. 'It really scared me, because if I hadn’t passed out and Riley hadn’t rung the ambulance I might not be here today. Diligent: Ms Henry said she and her partner had always drilled it into Riley and his sister Caitlin (pictured) that they should ring 999 if ever they could not wake either of them . 'It’s made me proud that Riley knew what to do. We knew he remembered 999, but were so shocked he was able to put it into action.' Ms Henry said she and partner, Rob Ward, 30, had always drilled it into Riley and his sister, Caitlin, five, that they should ring 999 if ever they could not wake either of them. The first paramedic on the scene, Paul Staples, said:  'When control radios through to tell you a child has dialled 999 you are immediately concerned for both the child and the patient. 'When I got to Dana’s house, Riley was stood at the door with a big smile. I think he was excited he had a police officer and paramedic in his house. 'He was really interested in all my equipment and kept coming to check on his mummy. 'His family must be so proud of him.

"By . Emma Innes . A woman who lost seven babies has finally become a mother after losing 17 stone. Michelle Turner, 35, suffered five miscarriages, an ectopic pregnancy and a stillbirth after ballooning to 30 stone. She also had to deal with the emotional heartbreak of three failed marriages and turned to comfort eating to fill the void. But as her weight increased, her chances of a successful pregnancy grew increasingly unlikely. Michelle Turner, 35, ballooned to 30st (left) after suffering five miscarriages, an ectopic pregnancy and a stillbirth. She had a gastric bypass on the NHS and lost 17st before having Mikayla (right) last year . Doctors eventually warned Ms Turner her weight could kill her and she was given a gastric bypass on the NHS. She lost 17 stone - over half her of her weight - and at a healthier 13st, she conceived for an eighth time and finally gave birth to daughter Mikayla. Ms Turner has just celebrated her little girl’s first birthday - and because of her gastric band, now eats less than her baby. She said: ‘I just can’t believe I’ve finally got a little girl all of my own. It’s all I’ve ever wanted. ‘When I was young I didn’t want to be a princess or pop star - I just wanted to be a mum. ‘I gave up hope so many times and I never thought it was going to have a happy ending. ‘I . was so depressed and miserable because I just wanted to be a mum, so I . just stopped caring and started eating. I was virtually housebound. Ms Turner was told she was so overweight that she was risking her life - as well as her chance of motherhood . ‘It was horrible - I was at rock bottom. I had lost everything I ever wanted so many times. ‘Many of my friends took pity on me and made me godmother to eight of their children to make me feel better. ‘I even became godmother to the kids of an Australian couple I met online. ‘But it didn’t help and in the end, I nearly gave up hope completely.’ Ms Turner suffered her first miscarriage when she was just 17 and had another two in her early twenties after her marriage to her first husband, a bus driver, in 1999. About 15 to 20 per cent of pregnant women in the UK are now overweight or obese. Most manage to have a successful pregnancy. However, . being overweight increases the risk of miscarriage, gestational . diabetes, high blood pressure, blood clots and infection. It also increases the risk of haemorrhage, problems with breastfeeding and having a baby with an abnormally high birth weight. Obese . pregnant women are more likely to need an induction, an instrumental . delivery - using forceps or ventouse - or a caesarean. Their babies are more likely to be stillborn, to have birth defects and to have health problems later in life. Source: NHS Choices . Devastated by her loss, she started gorging and became a virtual recluse and her marriage ended two years later. She remarried in 2005 but then had two further miscarriages with her second husband, a warehouse worker, in 2006 and 2007. It was then doctors warned Ms Turner her weight was making it harder to have a successful pregnancy. The worried medics also warned her obesity was putting strain on her heart and endangering her life. She . underwent gastric bypass surgery in 2008 and became pregnant for a . sixth time but lost that baby because of an ectopic pregnancy. She split from her second husband shortly after. A year later she married third husband Carl Turner, 29, and conceived for a seventh time in 2011. She went to full term but tragically little Jasmine was stillborn. By now Ms Turner’s weight was down to a healthy 13st and she was determined to make it eighth time lucky. Baby . Mikayla arrived healthily in January last year and Ms Turner, of . Crawley, West Sussex, said: ‘Now she’s a healthy, happy one-year-old and . I have to pinch myself every day. ‘I still look at her when she’s asleep in my arms and think: Are you really here? I’m so happy. ‘She . was worth all the heartbreak - every tear I cried and every sobbing . sleepless night. I’d go through it all again just to have Mikayla.’ Despite the joy of becoming a mother, Ms Turner’s third marriage has also ended in failure. Ms Turner said: 'She was worth all the heartbreak - every tear I cried and every sobbing sleepless night. I'd go through it all again just to have Mikayla' Midwife Carol Richardson, who is specialising in maternal obesity at Bournemouth University, said: ‘There is a higher miscarriage rate of 13.6 per cent with obese women, compared to 10.7 per cent in women with a normal weight. ‘There is a link there and there are a number of working hypotheses as to why that is but at the moment no one can quite pinpoint it. ‘It will be said that there are a number of factors but there is no doubt being a heavier weight will have an effect. ‘It may well be to do with the fact obese women need a higher intake of folic acid and vitamin D but they are only advised to take the amount other women take. ‘It may also be that obese women’s diets have an effect on the embryo. ‘I would advise women who are obese and want to have children to lose a bit of weight and try to look after their health.’","Michelle Turner had five miscarriages, an ectopic pregnancy and a stillbirth .

The 34-year-old from Sweden then posted a blog which when into more detail about the decision. 'I definitely want to be a part of [virtual reality], but I will not work with Facebook,' wrote Persson. 'Their motives are too unclear and shifting, and they haven’t historically been a stable platform. 'There’s nothing about their history that makes me trust them, and that makes them seem creepy to me. 'And I did not chip in 10 grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition. 'I have the greatest respect for the talented engineers and developers at Oculus. It’s been a long time since I met a more dedicated and talented group of people. 'I understand this is purely a . business deal, and I’d like to congratulate both Facebook and the Oculus . owners.

The deal puts the site in direct competition with Sony, which unveiled its own virtual reality Project Morpheus last week. The future of Facebook? The Oculus Rift headset in action. Facebook announced yesterday it had signed a 'definitive agreement' to buy Oculus VR for $2 billion . MailOnline was able to try Oculus Rift at the CES show in Las Vegas earlier this year. At first we were sceptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when  attached via straps. However, once our demo started, doubts were quickly forgotten. The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good. While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world. During several demonstrations we entered a vast dungeon and flew through space, with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as the user's head moves. It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. The social network said it has reached . a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR - the California firm . founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey. 'Mobile . is the platform of today, and now we're also getting ready for the . platforms of tomorrow,' said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. 'It's different from anything I've every experienced in my life,' said Zuckerberg. The . firm is among the most advanced in the VR field, and recently began . taking orders for the latest version of its $350 (£211) developers version. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Zuckerberg. 'Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won't be changing and we hope to accelerate. 'The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform. 'We're going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this. 'But this is just the start. After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Mark Zuckerberg, pictured . 'Imagine enjoying a court side seat at . a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the . world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face - just by putting on . goggles in your home.' The deal includes $400 million (£242 million) in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock. Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company's virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. Facebook said: 'While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.' Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers 'The Matrix - that's always been the dream,' said one Oculus Rift executive of its headset, pictured . The Oculus prototype, pictured, is packed with components - many of which Mark Zuckerberg claims can be found in a mobile phone, making the gadget relatively easy to produce . 'We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,' said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR. 'We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways. 'It is a transformative and disruptive . technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and . it's only just the beginning.' Oculus recently raised $75 million (£45 million) to make the headset. 'Over . the past 16 months, we’ve grown from a startup to a company whose . technology is poised to change the way we play, work and communicate,' said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR at the time. Palmer Luckey (pictured right) began Oculus when he was just 15, working on prototypes in his parent's garage. He started developing his own head-mounted VR displays when he was still in high school, and was in college when he created the first prototype of a consumer-priced VR headset called the Oculus Rift - although he eventually left to work on the project full time. MailOnline met Luckey at the CES show in Las Vegas, where he showed an incredible amount of enthusiasm for the product. He said he believed the technology's time had come. The firm originally turned to Kickstarter to raise money, but has since raised funds from investors across silicon Valley - until it was bought by Facebook for $2bn.","Minecraft creator Markus Persson tweeted objections to the deal last night .

"By . Sarah Bridge . Pop star Anastacia has revealed how she feels 'even more feminine' after her double mastectomy to beat breast cancer for the second time. The Chicago-born singer, 45, said that her surgery, carried out at the same time that actress Angelina Jolie revealed her own double mastectomy, had given her scars but that it had made her feel 'empowered'. Anastacia - full name Anastacia Lyn Newkirk - was first diagnosed with cancer ten years ago and underwent surgery last year when it emerged the disease had returned. Singer Anastacia, 45, underwent a double mastectomy last year after her second cancer diagnosis . In spite of her ordeal the singer said that she had been brought up to 'smile and be happy' in the face of adversity. 'I think I learned that very young and never lost it,' she said. 'I've never wanted to be sad.' Anastacia's surgery was more that just a double mastectomy, according to the star. 'In order to have a complete surgery . to make me feel like a woman, I had to remove my lats (latissimus dorsi . muscles) and put them on top of my breasts. That was the very worst. 'So . I have these great, wonderful, beautiful scars on my back, underneath . my wings. I ended up writing a song called Broken Wings.' Anastacia set up the Anastacia Fund when first diagnosed with cancer to raise awareness of the disease . Her positive attitude was revealed in an interview with a US magazine where she called her cancer 'a blessing.' The Metro reported that she added: 'I never would change it. I call even my second cancer more of a bigger blessing. 'I always look at what people may consider obstacles as triumphs, and I look at the second opportunity to having cancer as a blessing, because this time I got to choose the bigger stick in the choice, and I got the winning one by saying: 'you know what? You can take it.' Anastacia was full of praise for Angelina Jolie, who had undergone the same surgery after discovering that she had a very high chance of contracting cancer. 'The sharing of her journey, the simplicity in how she decided to do it - everything about it was a class act,' she said. 'I haven't spoken to her but she and I had our surgery at the same time. I was in my hospital bed in shock she had gone through that and that I had just done it.' Anastacia praised Angelina Jolie, who has also had a double mastectomy, for raising awareness of the disease . Last November Anastacia made her first . public appearance following her surgery, receiving the prestigious . Humanitarian Award from the GQ Men of the Year awards gala in Berlin.

The singer, whose hits include I'm Outta Love and One Day in Your Life, was only the second woman to be given the honour after Annie Lennox was a recipient in 2010 for her work to raise HIV awareness. In October Anastacia had updated her fans on her recovery as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. She said in a statement: 'In light of Breast Cancer Awareness Month l wanted to take the opportunity to support a cause particularly close to my heart. 'l was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time earlier this year and am currently in the final stages of recovery after undergoing a double mastectomy.' Anastacia was first diagnosed with cancer ten years ago but has refused to let it curb her music success . She added: 'It has been an intense journey but l am feeling great and ready to start the next chapter.' Anastacia, who said she underwent a double mastectomy with Latissimus Dorsi flap surgical procedure, was first diagnosed with the disease in 2003. She had previously announced in February last year that she had been diagnosed with the disease again, and was forced to cancel her planned European tour. Anastacia said at the time: 'I feel so awful to be letting down all my amazing fans who were looking forward to It's A Man's World Tour. It just breaks my heart to disappoint them.' Anastacia's tour had been scheduled to kick off in London a few months later, but the singer had at the time been instructed by her doctors to cancel all performances and not travel until further notice. However she performed at the QC Awards in November and is now hoping to resume her music career with her new album, Resurrection. 'It references cancer a lot,' she said. 'I've had a bit of a health detour but I always like to throw a negative situation into a positive.'","Pop star had reconstructive surgery after second battle with breast cancer .

"By . Mark Prigg . The ice caves of Alaska are virtually impenetrable for most explorers - but for a drone,  they are easy to get in (and out) of. A team of filmmakers took their quadcopter to a remote series of caves to create this incredible footage of the area rarely seen by humans. The team was able to fly through channels in the ice to gain entry to caves, and fly high above the breathtaking terrain to show the scales of the ice caves. Scroll down for video . The team were able to fly the drone inside massive ice caves in Alaska . The team used a commercially available drone called a DJI Phantom and a GoPro HERO3+ Black Edition to capture the footage . Los Angeles film company Firefight films travelled to the Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska to make the film. The idea came from DSLRpros, which sells the quadcopters,' Christopher Carson, the producer of the film, told MailOnline. The video, part of a film project entitled 'Bigger Than Life,' was produced in collaboration with DSLR Pros, an aerial film production company. 'They lent us a quadcopter for a film we're making on snowmobiling, and wanted to collect images and videos that are inspiring, videos of awe. 'We were thinking about what to shoot, originally we thought of really beautiful places like flower gardens in China. 'We decided to go out to the glaciers, then as soon as we saw the ice caves, we spent four days filming them. The drone was able to enter caves humans would struggle to get into . The team flew the drone around several caves in the area, a glacier about 12 miles (19 km) long. It is located in Mendenhall Valley, about 12 miles (19 km) from downtown Juneau in the southeast area of the U.S. state of Alaska, and is a popular tourist destination. It uses a standard, off the shelf drone called a DJI Phantom quadcopter for the footage, which was captured on a GoPro digital camera attached to the drone, along with a heavier duty drone. 'There were a lot of nervous moments,' admitted Carson. 'In the ice caves, these drones transmit the video, so we can send it into small crevasses. 'We had problems losing signal in there, they are hundreds of feet of ice think. 'There was also a lot of  of turbulence in the caves caused by the four blades - we almost lost the quadcopters a few  times.'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It's been more than a year since experts announced the remains found in a car park in Leicester were those of King Richard III - but now experts have raised serious concerns about the findings. Michael Hicks, from Winchester University, and archaeologist Martin Biddle, from the Winchester Research Unit, are challenging the results of the DNA testing, and the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating. They are even calling for a coroner's court to be set up to independently review all of the evidence. The University of Leicester concluded the remains, pictured, belonged to the king during a press conference in February last year. Experts from Winchester University are now challenging these findings including the results of the DNA testing and the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating . The remains believed to belong to King Richard III, painting pictured, were uncovered by archaeologists at former church in Leicester in 2012 . The University of Leicester concluded the remains belonged to the king during a press conference in February last year, after the body was excavated in September 2012. They claimed DNA samples matched that of a descendant of the king's maternal line, while the skeleton's spinal curvature also matched accounts of the humpback royal. The team used radiocarbon dating to determine when the skeleton died, and said this confirmed it was around the same time the king was killed during the Battle of Boswroth in 1485. Speaking to BBC History Magazine, . Professor Hicks argued the remains could belong to a victim of any of the . battles fought during the Wars of the Roses: 'Lots of other people who . suffered similar wounds could have been buried in the choir of the . church where the bones were found,' he explained. He . also queried the project's use of radiocarbon dating, which dates the . bones to the period of Richard’s death: 'Such a technique is imprecise. It will give you an era, but nothing more. 'In this case, it covers a period of 80 years.' Professor Hicks went on to question the prominence given to DNA testing in claims about the identity of the remains, too, adding: 'The DNA match could equally be the result of the bones being those of someone descended in the female line from Richard’s mother, Cecily Neville.' King Richard’s grandmother, Joan Beaufort, for example, had 16 children, 'which made her the ancestor of much of the nobility of the Wars of the Roses - quite a few of whom died violently in those conflicts,' continued Professor Hicks. 'Indeed, it is very hard to prove . that the skeleton belongs to a specific person. The Leicester team . themselves acknowledge that it’s extremely rare for archaeologists to . find a known individual, let alone a king.' The University of Leicester concluded . the remains belonged to the king during a press conference in February . last year after the body was excavated in September 2012. The skeleton was described of that of a slender male, in his late 20s or early 30s. Richard was 32 when he died. Pictures also revealed a . distinctive curvature of the spine synonymous with the hunchback king. There was, however, no evidence of a withered arm, which was also part of the Richard myth. While DNA samples matched that of a descendant of the king's maternal . line. The . team used radiocarbon dating to determine when the skeleton died and . said this confirmed it was around the same time the king was killed . during the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Trauma to the skeleton showed the . king died after one of two significant wounds to the back of the skull - . possibly caused by a sword and a halberd. Experts said this was consistent with contemporary accounts of the monarch being killed after receiving a blow to the head. The skeleton also showed a number of . non-fatal injuries to the head and rib and to the pelvis, which is . believed to have been caused by a wound through the right buttock. The remains were uncovered by archaeologists at former church in Leicester, which is now a social services car park. Professor Hicks argued the remains could belong to a victim of any of the . battles fought during the Wars of the Roses, as 'lots of other people who . suffered similar wounds could have been buried in the choir of the . church.' He . also queried the project's use of radiocarbon dating, because it covers a wide period of 80 years. Professor Hicks . added the DNA match could equally match anyone descended in the . female line from Richard’s mother, Cecily Neville. King . Richard’s grandmother, Joan Beaufort, for example, had 16 children. Professor Biddle continued historians know very little about the graves in the east end of the church and is calling for a coroner's court, or similar, to review the evidence. Professor Biddle echoed these concerns: 'We know very little about the graves in the east end of the church. 'How many burials were made there in the three centuries of the friary’s existence, and indeed after the battle of Bosworth? 'Without further excavation there is . no certainty. Before all this goes any further, it would be wise to be . certain the body really is his. 'Something akin to a coroner’s court . should be set up to consider all the evidence.' Two vertebrae of the skeleton, believed to belong to King Richard III, were found to show abnormal features relating to scoliosis, or curvature of the spine. Leicester University claimed this find corroborates historical accounts of Richard that described him as a hunchback . In . response to the claims Philippa Langley, who commissioned and paid for . the excavation, said: 'To say it cannot be claimed ‘with any confidence’ that this is Richard is quite puzzling. 'Given . the totality of the evidence, it can surely be said with considerable . confidence. Hicks says that there may have been ‘lots of people with . similar wounds’: perhaps he could name one who fits the bill?' Richard, depicted by William . Shakespeare as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the Tower . of London, died at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, defeated by an army led . by Henry Tudor. According to historical records, his . body was taken 15 miles to Leicester where it was displayed as proof of . his death, before being buried in the Franciscan friary. The team from Leicester University . set out to trace the site of the old church and its precincts in 2012, including . the site where Richard was finally laid to rest. They began excavating the city centre . location in August and soon discovered the skeleton, which . was found in good condition with its feet missing in a grave around 27 inches (68cm) below ground level. It was lying in a rough cut grave with the hands crossed in a manner which indicated they were bound when he was buried. To the naked eye, it was clear the remains had a badly curved spine and trauma injuries to the rear of the head. But archaeologists were keen to make no official announcement until the skeleton had been subjected to months of tests. Meanwhile, a spokesperson from the . University of Leicester added: 'The strength of the identification is . that different kinds of evidence all point to the same result. Hicks is . entitled to his views, but we would challenge and counter them. Professor Hicks concluded: 'I’m not saying that it’s not Richard - . it’s perfectly conceivable that it is - but we are not in a position to . say with any confidence that it’s him. 'Similarly, while the curved spine . suggests the skeleton is Richard’s, the presence of scoliosis does not . represent conclusive proof.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . If you often find yourself trailing your hand over luxurious clothing in a shop, you might be more tempted to blow your shopping budget, scientists claim. Touching items in a shop can make you more prone to buying them, according to a recent study. To combat the effect, a financial writer has suggested using the ‘one finger rule’ to satisfy the desire to touch, but prevent undesirable financial consequences. A UCLA study found that by merely touching an object (pictured) it increases a shopper's attachment to it as they feel as if they own it and also value it more highly than if they had not touched it . The study, by the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) investigated whether touching an object influences a consumer’s perception of it. They found that by merely touching an object it increases a shopper’s attachment to it as they feel as if they own it and also value it more highly than if they had not touched it. It is the first study to investigate the effect of touch on buyers, whereas 25 years of previous research has repeatedly shown that consumers’ valuation of an object increases once they have taken ownership of it, which is known as the endowment effect. Finance expert Kim McGrigg, who is based in Denver, came up with the ‘one finger rule’ to reduce the effect in shoppers, Lifehacker reported. Finance expert Kim McGrigg, came up with the 'one finger rule' to reduce the chance of shoppers overspending (illustrated) ‘You can touch anything you want, but only with one finger as it satisfies the desire to touch without implying ownership, which makes shoppers less likely to blow their budget and overspend,’ she said. Another study from the University of Wisconsin found that some people have trouble deciding whether to buy an object if they can’t touch it. Scientists confirmed that touching a product boosts a person’s sense of ownership over it so that handling goods is very close to owning them in a shopper’s mind. They believe that shoppers should understand the power of touch to stand any chance of not getting carried away on a shopping trip and marketers work hard to exploit the vulnerability in a field called haptic research. However, an MIT study in 2010 found that humans learn to want to touch things in infancy to gather information quickly, so it is hard to resist the temptation all together. Ms McGrigg came up with the one finger rule after a visit to a museum with 30 children who were only allowed to touch animal pelts with one finger – so they behaved but were satisfying with the interaction, according to Money Management.","UCLA study found that touching an object boosts a person's perception of ownership and increases the amount they will pay for an item .

"By . Sophie Borland . A second world-renowned scientist has come forward to support claims that ADHD  is not a real disease, but a description of symptoms. Dr Bruce Perry said most people displayed signs of the condition at some point in their lives. He also said psychostimulant drugs, such as Ritalin, used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may have long-term adverse effects. It comes after US neurologist Dr Richard Saul claimed ADHD did not exist, in a book serialised by the Daily Mail. Behavioural difficulties: An expert said anyone would fit at least two of the criteria for being diagnosed with ADHD at any time - and that the disorder is 'best thought of as a description' (file picture posed by models) He said treating children’s hyperactivity with drugs was similar to giving a heart attack patient painkillers – it ignores the cause of the problem, which could be as simple as an iron deficiency. Dr Perry, a neuroscientist at the ChildTrauma Academy in Houston, Texas, will meet Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith today at a lecture he is giving, hosted by charity the Early Intervention Foundation. Some 2 to 5 per cent of children are thought to have ADHD. Symptoms include short attention span, restlessness and fidgeting. Dr Perry said: ‘It is best thought of as a description . . . any one of us at any given time would fit at least a couple of those criteria.’ He said ADHD was a label for a set of symptoms, adding: ‘It’s a description rather than a real disease.’ Medicatin: Prescriptions for stimulant drugs such as Ritalin have increased twofold for children and adolescents in the UK with ADHD, and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008 . He implied that if you give drugs to . children with ADHD, they will need progressively larger doses as they . get older to achieve the same effect. The NHS Choices website describes the disorder as being 'a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness'. Common symptoms include a short attention span, restlessness or constant fidgeting and being easily distracted, the health service says. Many people with ADHD also have learning difficulties and other problems such as sleep disorders. The condition is normally diagnosed between the ages of three to seven. Potential risk factors include smoking, alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy, premature birth, and simply being male. He implied that if you give drugs to children with ADHD, they will need progressively larger doses as they get older to achieve the same effect. He likened it to children having lots of sweets, or being allowed to take risks. As they grew, they would need more sweet things or greater risks to feel the same pleasurable response. He said: ‘If you give psychostimulants to animals when they are young, their rewards systems change. 'They require much more stimulation to get the same level of pleasure.’ He added: ‘Taking a medication influences systems in ways we don’t always understand.’ Dr Perry said other therapies, such as yoga or even playing the drums, can be as effective as medication. Graham Allen, a Labour MP and EIF chairman, said Dr Perry was the ‘best in his field’, adding many senior politicians are already ‘convinced by the philosophy of his research’.","Dr Bruce Perry says the disorder is 'best thought of as a description'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Luck plays a part in most discoveries of ancient artefacts and bones. And one amateur palaeontologist has discovered a 75million-year-old giant turtle bone that matches another in a remote museum found over 160 years before. The perfect match proves the existence of a giant sea turtle measuring 10ft (3 metres) long, making it the largest of its kind ever known. Scroll down for video . The two partial limb fossils from the ancient sea turtle Atlantochelys mortoni fit together perfectly. The two halves were discovered at least 163 years apart, defying conventional wisdom that most fossils break down after weeks or months of surface exposure. The distal half (left) was discovered in 2012 and the proximal half (right) has been at Drexel University for more than a century . Amateur palaeontologist Gregory Harpel . discovered the bone on an embankment upstream of his usual . fossil-hunting haunt in Monmouth County, New Jersey, where he . was searching for fossilised shark teeth. The chemist from Oreland, Pennsylvania, said: ‘I picked it up and thought it was a rock at first – it was heavy’. He realised that the fossil was more scientifically significant than shark teeth and took it to the experts at the New Jersey State Museum, to which he ultimately donated his find. David Parris, the museum's curator of natural history and Jason Schein, his assistant, immediately recognised the fossil as a humerus – the large upper arm bone – from a turtle, but its shaft was broken so that only the distal end - the end nearest to the elbow - remained. Dr Parris thought the fossil looked strangely familiar and joked to Dr Schein that perhaps it was the missing half of a different large, partial turtle limb housed in the collections at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia. That bone also had a broken shaft, but only its proximal end, nearest to the shoulder, remained, so the coincidence was striking. Based on the complete fossilised limb, experts have calculated the animal's overall size to be about 10ft from tip to tail, making it one of the largest sea turtles ever known. It may have resembled modern loggerhead turtles. In this illustration, it is depicted with the outline of a human diver to indicate scale. The turtle lived 70 to 75 million years ago . ‘As soon as those two halves came together, like puzzle pieces, you knew it,’ said Dr Ted Daeschler, associate curator of vertebrate zoology and vice president for collections at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University. The discovery, which was made in 2012, linked scientists from both museums to their predecessors from the 19th century, according to the study in the forthcoming 2014 issue of the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Dr Schein said: ‘I didn't think there was any chance in the world they [the two fossils] would actually fit.’ That's because the Academy's fossil was initially thought to be too old as palaeontologists expect that fossils found in exposed strata of rock will break down from exposure to the elements if they are not collected and preserved, at least within a few years, or a decade at the longest. There was no reason to think a lost half of the same old bone would survive intact and exposed in a stream bed from at least the time of the old bone's first scientific description in 1849, they said. The Academy's bone was also without a match of any kind, making a perfect match seem even more farfetched. Amateur palaeontologist Gregory Harpel discovered the bone on an embankment upstream of his usual fossil-hunting haunt in Monmouth County, New Jersey, where he was searching for fossilised shark teeth . A 3-D scan of the two broken turtle limb fossils from Atlantocheyls mortoni shows a detailed view of their surfaces (pictured). Paleontologists from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University and from the New Jersey State Museum concluded that these two fossils came from the same animal, despite being discovered separately at least 163 years apart . It was originally named and described by 19th century naturalist Louis Agassiz as the first, or type specimen, of its genus and species, Atlantochelys mortoni. It remained the only known fossil specimen from that genus and species until 2012 when Dr Schein carried the ‘new’ New Jersey fossil to the Academy in Philadelphia, bringing the two halves together. ‘Sure enough, you have two halves of the same bone, the same individual of this giant sea turtle,’ said Dr Daeschler. ‘One half was collected at least 162 years before the other half.’ Now scientists are revising their conventional wisdom to say that, sometimes, exposed fossils can survive longer than previously thought. Dr Schein said: ‘The astounding confluence of events that had to have happened for this to be true is just unbelievable and probably completely unprecedented in palaeontology.’ The fully assembled humerus now gives the scientists more information about the massive sea turtle it came from as well. The 70 to 75million-year-old species may have resembled modern loggerhead turtles (pictured), but was much larger than any sea turtle species alive today, at around 10ft long . With a complete limb, they have calculated that the animal was about 10ft from tip to tail, making it one of the largest sea turtles ever known. The species may have resembled modern loggerhead turtles, but was much larger than any sea turtle species alive today. Experts believe that the entire unbroken bone was originally embedded in sediment during the Cretaceous Period, 70 to 75 million years ago, when the turtle lived and died. They think that sediments eroded and the bone fractured millions of years later during the Pleistocene or Holocene, before the bone pieces became embedded in sediments and protected from further deterioration for perhaps a few thousand more years until their discovery.","An amateur palaeontologist discovered the 'new' fossil, which is half of a humerus, in Monmouth County, New Jersey in 2012 .

"By . Associated Press . As Dr Kim Seok-Kwun begins surgery to create a functioning penis for a Buddhist monk who was born female, he is well aware of the unease his work creates in this deeply conservative country. The devout Protestant known as the 'father of South Korean transgender people' once wrestled with similar feelings. 'I've decided to defy God's will,' Dr Kim, 61, said in an interview before the monk's recent successful surgery to become a man. 'At first, I agonized over whether I should do these operations because I wondered if I was defying God. I was overcome with a sense of shame. But my patients desperately wanted these surgeries. Without them, they'd kill themselves.' Dr Kim is a pioneer in slowly changing views on sexuality and gender in South Korea, where many have long considered even discussions of sexuality a taboo. He has conducted about 320 sex change operations over the past 28 years, widely believed to be the most by any single doctor in the country. Game changer: Dr. Kim Seok-Kwun, 61, is based at the Dong-A University Hospital in Busan and is a pioneer in slowly changing views on sexuality and gender in the primarily Christian country . Dr Kim said the monk, who underwent 11 hours of surgery, did not want to be interviewed for fear of offending Buddhist believers at his temple. The doctor said the monk has been taking hormone therapy and has been living as a man for a long time. When Dr Kim first started doing the surgeries in the 1980s, his pastor objected. Friends and fellow doctors joked that he was going to hell if he didn't stop. He now feels a great sense of achievement for helping people who feel trapped in the wrong body. He believes he's correcting what he calls God's mistakes. 'Some people are born without genitals or with cleft lips or with no ears or with their fingers stuck together. Why does God create people like this? Aren't these God's mistakes?' Dr Kim said. 'And isn't a mismatched sexual identity a mistake, too?' A strong bias against sexual . minorities persists in South Korea, the result of lingering Confucian . beliefs that children should never damage the bodies they received from . their parents; a large, vocal conservative Christian community; and past . military-backed dictatorships that ignored minority voices. Sex change operations 'are a blasphemy against God and make the world a more miserable place,' said the Rev. Hong Jae Chul, president of the Seoul-based Christian Council of Korea. He called Dr Kim's remarks 'cursed and deplorable.' His work: Harisu, South Korea's most famous transsexual entertainer, underwent a sex-change operation from Dr. Kim and compares her transformation to The Little Mermaid . Dr Kim, a plastic surgeon at Dong-A University Hospital in the southeastern port city of Busan, specializes in fixing facial deformities. He began doing sex change operations in 1986 after several men wearing women's clothing visited him separately and asked him to construct vaginas for them. The first visitor had already had his penis removed, Kim said. Dr Kim initially turned them away because he knew nothing about sex change surgery. But he kept thinking about their pleas, studied foreign publications and began performing the surgeries a year later. His best known patient is South Korea's most famous transsexual entertainer, Harisu, who had Dr Kim officiate at her 2007 wedding to a male singer. Harisu, who only uses a single name, said in an interview at a Seoul coffee shop that the pain she felt after her 1995 male-to-female surgery 'was like a hammer hitting your genitals.' But days later, when she left the hospital, she felt reborn, comparing her transformation to the Disney film The Little Mermaid, where a mermaid gives up her fish tail in exchange for human legs and eventual happiness. Many of Dr Kim's earliest patients were in their 40s and 50s. Sometimes parents showed up just before surgeries, furious and threatening to disown their children. Today, most of his sex-change patients . are in their early 20s, and sometimes their parents agree to pay for . the surgery. Male-to-female procedures cost 11 million to 15 million won ($10,210 to $13,920), and the more difficult female-to-male procedures cost 31 million won ($28,760). The changes in his clientele reflect changes in South Koreans' views of sexual minorities. Getting ready: Dr Kim prepares to perform an operation on a Buddhist nun at the hospital in Busan - one of more than 300 sex-change operations he has completed thusfar . Life's work: Dr Kim is pictured completing a sex-change operation in Busan on a nun - a procedure that has made him a controversial figure among South Korea's many religiously conservative groups . Several gay-themed movies and TV dramas have become hits. An actor once banned from show business because of his homosexuality is working again. A well-known male movie director symbolically tied the knot with his male partner last year in what was the first high-profile ceremony of its kind in South Korea, which still doesn't legally recognize same-sex marriage. At the same time, activists say transsexuals remain likely to face harassment, abuse or insults, and many suffer from depression and have attempted suicide. The conservative government of President Park Geun-hye, which took office in early 2013, said it would create a broad anti-discrimination law, but there's been no major progress. In 2012, vehement protests by conservative activists and Christian groups forced a TV channel to scrap a talk show program featuring transgender people after airing its first segment. Transgender people who want to legally change their gender also face obstacles in South Korea. The Supreme Court suggests that judges allow such changes only for those who have undergone sex change operations, have lost reproductive capability, are not married and have no underage children. The lack of any binding rules has led . transsexuals to flock to judges rumored to be less strict about . approving gender change requests, according to Hahn Chae Yoon, leader of . the Korean Sexual-Minority Culture and Rights Center in Seoul. Last . year a Seoul court approved gender change requests for five people even . though they hadn't yet completed their female-to-male procedures, . something previously deemed necessary. Since then, about 30 other people . in similar situations have been allowed by the court to legally change . their sex, according to court officials. Post-op: Harisu said in an interview that the pain she felt after her 1995 male-to-female surgery 'was like a hammer hitting your genitals' Life of death: Harisu says that she may be dead had she not undergone the surgery, because she was always a woman on the inside . Dr Kim requires his candidates for surgery to get testimony from at least two psychiatrists showing a diagnosis of gender identity disorder. They're asked to live for more than one year in the other gender's clothing and hairstyle and to get parental approval. Of his 320 sex change operations, about 210 are male-to-female, the rest female to male. Many patients see the operation as a matter of life or death. Before her surgery, Harisu, the transsexual entertainer, signed a document acknowledging that she knew she could die during surgery, though Kim said none of his sex-change operations have gone so horribly wrong. 'If I had lived as a man without undergoing a sex change operation, I might be dead already,' Harisu said. 'I was already a woman except for my genitals. I didn't want to live an awkward life with those genitals ... I'm a woman, so I wanted to live as a woman.'","Dr Kim Seok-Kwun is a pioneer in slowly changing views on sexuality and gender in South Korea, where many have long considered even discussions of sexuality a taboo .
A strong bias against sexual minorities persists in South Korea, the result of lingering Confucian beliefs that children should never damage the bodies they received from their parents .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . News that hovering drones can now steal passwords from unsuspecting phones will do little to ease fears that the widespread use of unmanned aircraft could infringe upon our privacy. Hackers in the U.S have managed to 'steal' information, including Amazon passwords, bank details and even people’s home addresses using an aircraft. While it might sound like the crime of the century, the exercise was an experiment to show it is possible to use drones to tap into a smartphone’s Wi-Fi settings and access valuable information. Scroll down for video . Hackers have proved that it is possible to steal information, including Amazon passwords, bank details and even home addresses from smartphones that have Wi-Fi turned on, using specially adapted drones (a stock image of a quadcopter is pictured) The drone, known as Snoopy, seeks out smartphones that have Wi-Fi turned on. It then makes use of built-in technology which can see what networks the phones have accessed in the past. In theory, almost any drone could be adapted to do this. Phones 'noisily' reach out to networks, according to the experts. Snoopy looks for this activity and when hovering nearby it emits a signal masquerading as another network. The phone ‘trusts’ that it is accessing a trusted Wi-Fi network but instead connects to the quadcopter's network. Snoopy can then intercept everything a smartphone sends and receives and allows skilled hackers to see passwords, bank details and the phone's location. The test was conducted in London and the group will share their findings at the Black Hat Asia cybersecurity conference in Singapore next week, CNN reported. The drone, known as Snoopy, seeks out smartphones that have Wi-Fi turned on. It then makes use of built-in technology which can see what networks the phones have accessed in the past. In theory, almost any drone could be adapted to do this. London-based Sensepost security researcher Glenn Wilkinson, said: ‘Their phone will very noisily be shouting out the name of every network its ever connected to. 'They'll be shouting out, “Starbucks, are you there?...McDonald's Free Wi-Fi, are you there?”’ When this happens, Snoopy hovers nearby and emits a signal masquerading as another network and the phone ‘thinks’ it is accessing a trusted Wi-Fi network. However, when it connects to the quadcopter’s network, Snoopy will intercept everything a smartphone sends and receives using a complicated method described by the company. Wilkinson said: ‘Your phone connects to me and then I can see all of your traffic.’ He is able to see the websites a person visits, any credit card information entered or saved, their location, usernames and passwords. In the wrong hands, this could potentially leave a mystified smartphone user out of pocket. The hackers managed to gain access by looking at a unique identification number known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address. This number matches web traffic to a specific device. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology, Wilkinson spent an hour with CNN showing them how he could obtain network names and GPS coordinates for 150 smartphones used by Londoners. While collecting metadata and network names is not strictly illegal, intercepting passwords and credit card details with the intent of using them is. The drone emits a signal masquerading as a trusted Wi-Fi network, which the phone 'trusts'. However, once connected, this network  intercepts everything a smartphone sends and receives, giving hackers access to password information (illustrated) and even bank details that are entered or saved . The ethical hackers said they're demonstrating the technology to highlight how vulnerable smartphone users can be. The drones might seem even more threatening to people than remote hackers because the aircraft can hover close to potential ‘victims’ are incredibly mobile. There is a prospect that the technology could be put to good use for law enforcement purposes, however, such as identifying looters in a riot. While it is not thought that anyone is currently using this snooping technique in the real world, smartphone users can protect themselves by shutting off their Wi-Fi when they are not using it, or only access secure networks.","Experts in London have proved it's possible to use drones to steal data .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . and Ben Spencer . He was one of Britain’s greatest ever painters, his works lauded for their atmosphere and visual mastery. Scientists, however, have found another  reason to marvel at the pictures of J.M.W. Turner – they believe they will help them to assess how polluted the world once was. They say landscapes by artists such as Turner accurately recorded the chemicals in the air. Turner's painting 'The Lake, Petworth' reveals that ash and gas released during a volcanic eruption made sunsets appear redder. Scientists made the discovery by examining the use of red and green on the horizon, which they believe contains environmental information about aerosols in the atmosphere . The key, according to the atmospheric physicists, is in the colour of the sunsets they depicted. Scientists . analysed hundreds of paintings completed between 1500 and 2000, a . period covering more than 50 major volcanic eruptions around the globe. Greek experts said paintings of sunsets can help scientists study previous levels of pollution in the Earth’s atmosphere. In 1815 there was a massive volcanic eruption in Indonesia, which led to spectacular sunsets in Europe that were captured by painters including Turner. The aerosol particles scattered sunlight and produced bright red and orange sunsets in Europe for up to three years after the eruption. Experts are examining Turner's sunsets and others recorded by famous artists and have found that amounts of red and green along the horizon of paintings provide information on the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere. Dr Zerefos said: ‘We found that red-to-green ratios measured in the sunsets of paintings by great masters correlate well with the amount of volcanic aerosols in the atmosphere, regardless of the painters and of the school of painting.’ The . results, published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, . reveal that when the Tambora volcano in Indonesia erupted in 1815, . painters could see the colours of the sky changing. The volcanic ash and gas that was spewed into the atmosphere travelled the world and as these aerosol particles scattered sunlight, they produced bright red and orange sunsets in Europe for up to three years after the eruption. Turner was one of the artists who painted the stunning sunsets during that time and experts are now using his and other masters' paintings to retrieve information on the composition of the past atmosphere. His celebrated work The . Lake, Fighting Bucks, painted at  Petworth near Chichester in 1829, is a . clear demonstration of the effect. Lead author Christos Zerefos, a professor of atmospheric physics at the Academy of Athens in Greece, said: ‘Nature speaks to the hearts and souls of great artists. ‘But we have found that, when colouring sunsets, it is the way their brains perceive greens and reds that contains important environmental information.’ According to the study, painters in Europe, such as John Crome, whose work, 'The Windmill Near Norwich' is pictured, could see the colours of the sky changing after the Tambora volcano in Indonesia erupted in 1815 . Dr Zerefos and his team analysed hundreds of high-quality digital photographs of sunset paintings created between 1500 and 2000, during which time there were 50 large volcanic eruptions around the globe. They were looking to find out whether the relative amounts of red and green along the horizon of each painting could provide information on the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere. Dr Zerefos said: ‘We found that red-to-green ratios measured in the sunsets of paintings by great masters correlate well with the amount of volcanic aerosols in the atmosphere, regardless of the painters and of the school of painting.’ Skies more polluted by volcanic ash scatter sunlight more, so they appear redder and similar effects are seen with mineral or man-made aerosols. Air with a higher amount of aerosols has a higher 'aerosol optical depth' - a parameter the team calculated using the red-to-green ratios in the paintings. They then compared these values with those given by independent proxies such as ice core and ‘volcanic-explosivity’ data to find a good correlation. Scientists analysed hundreds of digital photographs of sunset paintings created between 1500 and 2000, during which time there were 50 large volcanic eruptions around the globe. They were looking to find out whether the relative amounts of red and green along the horizon of each painting could provide information on the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere. A photo of a sunset and eruption in Hawaii is pictured . To support their work, the researchers also asked an artist to paint sunsets during and after the passage of a Saharan dust cloud over the island of Hydra in June 2010. The painter was not aware of the dust event. The scientists then compared measurements of the aerosol optical depth made by modern instruments with those estimated from the red-to-green ratios of the paintings and of digital photographs, and found that they all matched well. Since aerosols scatter sunlight, less of it reaches the surface, leading to cooling. The Tambora eruption, which is thought to be the largest in recorded history, killed around 10,000 people directly and more than 60,000 others due to the starvation and disease during the 'volcanic winter' that followed. Aerosol optical depth can be directly used in climate models, so having estimates for this parameter helps researchers understand how aerosols have affected the Earth's climate in the past. The information can also help improve predictions of future climate change. Dr Zerefos added: ‘We wanted to provide alternative ways of exploiting the environmental information in the past atmosphere in places where and in centuries when, instrumental measurements were not available.’ The researchers  asked artist P. Tetsis to paint sunsets during and after the passage of a Saharan dust cloud over the island of Hydra in June 2010 (pictured). They then compared measurements of the aerosol optical depth made by modern instruments with those estimated from the red-to-green ratios of the paintings and of digital photographs, and found that they all matched well .","Turner’s work reveals that ash and gas released during a major volcanic .

"By . Mark Prigg . Facebook has bought a virtual reality headset firm in an unexpected $2bn deal that puts it in a head on battle with Sony. The social network announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, a California firm founded by 21 year old college dropout Palmer Luckey that is developing leading VR headset. 'Mobile is the platform of today, and now we're also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,' said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Scroll down for video . The future of Facebook? The Oculus Rift headset in action. Facebook today bought the firm for $2bn . MailOnline was able to try Oculus Rift at the CES show in Las Vegas earlier this year. At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when  attached via straps. However, once our demo started, doubts were quickly forgotten. The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good. While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world. During several demonstrations we entered a vast dungeon and flew through space, with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as the user's head moves. It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. 'It's different from anything I've every experienced in my life,' said Zuckerberg. The firm is among the most advanced in the VR field, and recently began taking orders for the latest version of its $350 developers version. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Zuckerberg. 'Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won't be changing and we hope to accelerate. 'The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform. 'We're going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. 'Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this. 'But this is just the start. 'After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. 'Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face - just by putting on goggles in your home.' The $2bn deal includes $400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Mark Zuckerberg, pictured . Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company's virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. Facebook said 'While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.' Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers 'The Matrix - that's always been the dream,' said one Oculus Rift executive of its headset, pictured . The Oculus prototype, pictured, is packed with components - many of which Mark Zuckerberg claims can be found in a mobile phone, making the gadget relatively easy to produce . 'We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,' said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR. 'We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways. Palmer Luckey of Oculus . 21-year-old Palmer Luckey began Oculus when he was just 15, working on prototypes in his parent's garage. He started developing his own head-mounted VR displays when he was still in high school, and was in college when he created the first prototype of a consumer-priced VR headset called the Oculus Rift - although he eventually left to work on the project full time. MailOnline met Luckey at the CES show in Las Vegas, where he showed an incredible amount of enthusiasm for the product. He said he believed the technology's time had come. The firm originally turned to Kickstarter to raise money, but has since raised funds from investors across silicon Valley - until it was today bought by Facebook for $2bn. 'It is a transformative and disruptive technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and it's only just the beginning.' Oculus recently raised $75m to make the headset. 'Over the past 16 months, weâ€™ve grown from a startup to a company whose technology is poised to change the way we play, work and communicate,' said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR at the time.","Oculus founded by 21 year old college dropout Palmer Luckey .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . For centuries people have marked the passing of time using the moon’s phases. But only now is the world's first moon clock being planned, which will use tidal power to display the moon's phase on its 'face'. The huge sculpture is intended to sit at the historic centre of time at Greenwich, London, as part of a huge redevelopment of the Greenwich peninsula. Scroll down for video . The world's first moon clock  is being planned and would use tidal power to display the size and position of the moon on its three concentric rings (pictured). The huge sculpture is intended to sit at the historic centre of time at Greenwich, as part of a huge redevelopment of the Greenwich peninsula . Size: 131ft (40metres) wide and 43ft (13metres) tall. Materials: Recycled glass will be used for the rings. Power: The clock would use tidal power to turn turbines and generate electricity. Location: Greenwich, on the bank of the Thames to the west of the O2 Arena. Cost: Around £6million with an estimate of £9.6million for the whole project. Opening date:  Autumn 2016 if all goes to plan. The clock, which is called Aluna, will measure 131ft (40 metres) wide and 43ft (13metres) high if it is built on the bank of the Thames, just west of the O2 Arena, as planned. It would be made of three concentric glass rings with LEDs beneath the surface, producing light powered by tidal turbines. The recycled glass rings would show the waxing, waning, rising and setting of the moon, along with the ebb and flow of the tides. By looking at how each of the rings are illuminated, people will be able to tell the phase and position of the moon and the height of the tides. The ‘flow of light’ will move slowly and continuously around the structure in a clockwise direction, according to the project’s creators. An artist's impression of the moon clock, which will form part of the redevelopment of Greenwich. Aluna will be powered by the very thing it is designed to measure - the moon. The moon creates the tides and the clock will transform them into kinetic energy and then electricity by using turbines that are planned to sit in the Thames . The largest ring, called . the 'Lunar Phase', would show the waxing and waning of the moon, which takes . 29.5 calendar days. At New Moon, the unlit ring would begin to gradually ‘wax’ on and by full moon, the whole ring will light up so that the circle of light is complete. The ring would then ‘wane’ back to its unlit state and the cycle would begin again. The 24 hour 50 minute Lunar Day is represented by a ring positioned half way between the first ring and the ground. A band of light is intended to point to the moon’s position in the sky and when it is below the horizon, there will be a ring lit below a viewer’s feet. A smaller band of light will follow the progress of the tides, with each cycle taking 12 hours and 25 minutes. The recycled glass rings (illustrated) would show the waxing, waning, rising and setting of the moon, along with the ebb and flow of the tides. By looking at how each of them is illuminated, people would be able to tell the phase and position of the moon and the height of the tides . The largest ring shows the wax and wane of the moon, the middle ring the 24hour 50 minute Lunar Day and the smallest, the progress of the tides (all pictured) The clock is intended to be visible 24 . hours a day as it would emit white light in the dark, which would fade . as the sun rises, while the edges of the structure are designed to be . lit up with coloured LEDs to save a little energy. If built, Aluna will be powered by the very . thing it is designed to measure – the moon. It is well known that the . moon creates the tides and the clock would transform them into kinetic . energy and then electricity by using turbines that are planned to sit in . the Thames. Efficient . use of renewable energy is one of the project's primary objectives and . when the largest ring is unlit around New Moon, the clock would conserve . more energy than it uses and store it for Full Moon times . The team behind the project says it has had a favourable response from Greenwich Council who have agreed to the clock in principle. An initial feasibility report has been submitted to the authority ahead of the formal plans, which are set to be unveiled and lodged in the summer. A spokesman for the project said: ‘Aluna will be the world's first tidal powered moon clock, and a monumental timepiece for Greenwich, London, the UK and the world.’ Construction would take around 16 months and the organisers hope the project will be completed in autumn 2016 in time for the lunar eclipse set for that year. The people behind the project, including London-based artist Laura Williams, who came up with the design in 2002 when studying Art at Central Saint Martins, London, hope it will change the way people consider time and understand our planet. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said the clock ‘would showcase the best of British creativity and engineering and offer inspiring opportunities for intercultural dialogue and understanding. ‘Powered by the tidal river Thames and built from glass recycled by Londoners themselves, a world first like Aluna would draw international visitors and engage Londoners. ‘Greenwich Riverside is identified as a Strategic Cultural Area in the London Plan and I believe Aluna could act as a focal point for the cultural regeneration of this area.’ It is estimated that Aluna could cost around £6million - with an estimated cost of £9.6million for the whole project - and is being funded from a variety of sources, including donations, sponsors and grants.","The sculpture is intended to sit at the historic centre of time at Greenwich and use tides to power the light-up clock .

"By . Suzannah Hills . An archaeology race is on to secure the ancient burial site of three Egyptian kings which contains relics that will outshine even that of Tutankhamun's, it has been claimed. British archaeologist John Romer, 72, believes he has discovered the site where three ancient Egyptian priest kings - Herihor, Piankh and Menkheperre - were buried in Luxor, Egypt, almost 3,000 years ago. He claims the burial ground will yield such magnificent treasures that those discovered in the nearby tomb of Tutankhamun in the Valley of the Kings will seem like a 'display in Woolworths' in comparison. Like a plot out of an Indiana Jones movie, experts are now racing to secure the site called Wadi el-Gharbi, located in the cliffs on Luxor's west bank, before the arrival of so-called treasure hunters and tomb-raiders. Race: Archaeology teams are racing to find the tomb of three ancient Egyptian kings in Luxor's west bank . Search: It is believed three priest kings - Herihor, Piankh and Menkheperre - were buried in Wadi el-Gharbi in Luxor's west bank near the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens . It is feared that ancient rock inscriptions surrounding the site, which has remained largely untouched since 1085BC, could be damaged by their quad bikes, rope ladders and other equipment. Romer told the Sunday Times: 'Last week, three people were arrested by the army security services at Luxor for entering it.' The only person known to have excavated at the site was Howard Carter - the man who first scratched a hole through the sealed doorway of Tutankhamun's burial chamber in 1922. Carter had previously cut trenches across the valley floor at the Wadi el-Gharbi site over the course of two weeks in 1916. Mystery: It is believed the tomb where Heridor (pictured left) and Piankh (pictured right) was buried may contain treasures to rival those found in Tutankhamun's burial site in the Valley of the Kings . The Valley of the Kings where Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered. The tomb of the three priest kings is believed to be located just a few miles away in Wadi el-Gharbi . He discovered huge mounds of limestone chippings on the wadi floor, identical to those found in the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings. But Carter gave up on his excavations, possibly because he had little idea of what may be buried at the site. Romer has since focused on deciphering inscriptions left behind in the area by the royal workmen who laboured there. Romer and his colleague, Alex Peden, have found the name of Herihor among 150 rock inscriptions. Romer believes Carter was mistaken to restrict his search to the valley floor and claims the tomb is instead located higher up in the limestone cliffs which soar to around 1,000ft. Famous discovery: The tomb of Tutankhamun, buried in 1325 B.C., was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922 . Treasures: The gold burial mask of Tutankhamun, pictured at the Cairo museum in Cairo, Egypt, was among the treasures found in his tomb . He claims: Herihor is most likely to be buried in a coffin of gold, like Tutankhamun [250 years before]. There are likely to be canopic chests, objects of alabaster, gold-plated statues, and thrones, though possibly not chariots,.' Romer, who has been researching the potential tomb for 40 years, still needs to secure a permit from Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities to carry out his search. He now fears he may be beaten to finding the tomb after discovering a rival expedition has already arrived at the area. Romer says he would be happy to forgo the chance of discovering the tomb so long as the excavation is done properly and keeps valuable inscriptions intact. Priceless: A pendant found in Tutankhamun's tomb. It forms a rebus for his throne name Nebkheperure and is made of gold set with inlays of colored glass and semiprecious stones .

Despite travelling more than ever before, Britons still struggle with their geography when it comes to pinpointing exactly where they have been, according to a new study. When tested by Hotels.com, a shocking 74 per cent of Britons failed to identify summer hotspot Greece on a map, despite it being one of the most popular summer holiday destinations in Europe. Geography lesson: While Britons are travelling more than ever, they still struggle to identify where they have been on a map . A further 54 per cent were unable to find Cyprus, where millions of Britons like to holiday in both the Greek-owned south and Turkish owned north each summer. Worryingly, a further 12 per cent of those questioned confused South Africa with Spain and 10 per cent thought China was Brazil. Americans could be offended too, after 10 per cent of those asked, believed Poland was the United States. The country Britons had the most trouble identifying was Bulgaria, with 90 per cent marking it incorrectly, despite its rising popularity for sun and ski holidays. Wedged between Romania, Serbia, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey, the Mediterranean hotspot left holidaymakers struggling to pick out exactly where exactly it was. Where in the world?: The biggest confusion was over Bulgaria, which a shocking 90 per cent of people identified incorrectly . Travellers also had trouble with South East Asia,  with the location of Singapore stumping 88 per cent of people, while Thailand confused 66 per cent of respondents and 63 per cent misplaced Vietnam.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A previously unheard Michael Jackson track set to be released on the singer's forthcoming posthumous album is about child abuse. The new song, entitled Do You Know Where Your Children Are, tells the story of a 12-year-old girl who runs away from her abusive stepfather and turns to prostitution. It is one of eight tracks recorded by the singer before his death in June 2009 at the age of 50 which will feature on the new album Xscape, set to be released in May. Scroll down for video . New release: A previously unheard Michael Jackson track set to be released on the singer's forthcoming posthumous album Xscape is about child abuse . In one of the song's verses Jackson sings: 'She wrote that she is tired of step-daddy using her/Saying that heâ€™ll buy her things, while sexually abusing her,' according to the Daily Mirror. According to leaked lyrics from the chorus, the song continues: 'Do you know where your children are? Because it's now twelve o'clock/If they're somewhere out on the street just imagine how scared they are.' The track includes the line: 'Save me (from this living hell) Save me (cause I don't wanna know)', and fans of Jackson have speculated that it was written in response to abuse claims made against the singer. Lyrics: In the song, Jackson sings: 'She wrote that she is tired of step-daddy using her/Saying that heÂ¿ll buy her things, while sexually abusing her' Not guilty: Jackson, pictured leaving the Santa Barbara County Superior courthouse with his father Joe, was acquitted of sexual abuse charges in 2005 . In the mid 1990s Jackson was accused of sexual abuse by the family of a 13-year-old boy Jordan Chandler. The case was settled out of court for about $25 million and no formal charges were brought against the singer. In . 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse . allegations and several other charges after a jury in Santa Maria, . California, found him not guilty on all counts. Album: Xscape, comprises of a collection of tracks 'contemporised' by L.A. Reid and a team of producers, including Timbaland (pictured) Dancer Wade Robson is suing Jackson's estate after claiming that he suffered sexual abuse over several years at the hands of The King Of Pop. In 2005, Robson was a key witness who . helped clear Jackson of molestation charges. However, he has since . claimed that he gave the favorable testimony after 'brainwashing' by the . singer. A hearing is due to take place in June. The new record, Xscape, comprises of a collection of tracks recorded before the singer's death and 'contemporised' by Epic Records boss L.A. Reid and a team of producers, including Timbaland. Jackson's estate provided Reid with unlimited access to four decades worth of material by the singer, resulting in the new album, due to be released on May 13. 'Michael left behind some musical . performances that we take great pride in presenting through the vision . of music producers that he either worked directly with or expressed . strong desire to work with,' said Reid. 'We are extremely proud and honored to present this music to the world.' The . name XSCAPE is a nod to the late singer's favoured naming process of . picking one of his songs to name his record after, in this case the . title track which was written and originally produced by Jackson and . Rodney Jerkins. A Deluxe . Edition of the record will also be released which will include all of . the sourced Michael Jackson recordings in their original form.

"By . John Stevens . Blind to the danger, a gang of would-be immigrants run to board a moving lorry. To them it is a passport to a new life in Britain. In fact it is a potential death trap. Four other migrants died in just one week in Calais, it emerged last night, and scenes like the one pictured are being repeated every day at the French port. Scroll down for video . Dicing with death: Three migrants make a desperate dash for a lorry as it briefly slows down at a junction near Calais docks . The dramatic images were captured as an ominous report by MigrationWatch: . * Warned immigration from the EU will bring enough people to fill a city the size of Manchester here every four years; . * Called for ministers to deny migrants access to Britain’s generous system of in-work benefits, such as tax credits, for the first five years they are here. In Calais, hundreds of migrants from outside the EU are living in a camp yards from the perimeter fence of the port. Breaking in: As it halts they force open the back doors and they clamber on as the lorry moves off . Ultimate price: Ethiopian Senay Berthay was one of four killed . Charities say there are more than 600 in the town, the greatest number since the closure of the Red Cross camp at Sangatte in 2002 – and they are taking advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence. On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port. The body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais’s  Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a  vehicle transporter. It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction. A French police spokesman said: ‘The Polish driver heard a noise and stopped suddenly. One of the vehicles on board his truck backed into the stowaway and killed him. He was left lying in a pool of blood.’ Let's go: They leap into action as the lorry slows down . But fatalities and failed attempts do nothing to weaken the remaining migrants’ resolve to reach Britain. When asked why they were trying to board the lorries, one told the Mail: ‘We have to go to your country. Take me to England.’ Most of the migrants are sleeping in the main camp on a disused railway line just beside the main port where ferries go  to Dover. Men gathered for several hours at the junction near the port, relentlessly trying to break into vehicles or get underneath to sit on the axle, but police did nothing. When a force car passed by it did not stop and no attempt was made to apprehend the men. In wait: More migrants hide behind a wall near the port . At a second location, migrants were able to get beyond the port’s perimeter fence by freely walking through an unmanned entrance before climbing up on a bank beside the road that lorries have to drive down to get on to the ferries. The men were witnessed crouching down at the side of the road, which is inside the port, before jumping out and trying to get on to lorries when they were forced to slow down because of a build-up of traffic. British lorry drivers, who are fined £2,000 if found carrying an illegal migrant, said ‘extremely light-touch’ policing by the French meant they were ‘sitting ducks’ for those wanting to smuggle themselves across the Channel. Ahmed, 31, from Afghanistan, who is one of the migrants sleeping in more than 100 tents in the camp, said he was confident he would get to Britain. ‘I will get there – I have to. I have lived in countries throughout Europe since I left Afghanistan five years ago, but Britain is where I want to be,’ he said. ‘We either try to get in the back of lorries, or get underneath and on to the axle depending on how many seconds we think we have when they stop at junctions or have to slow down on the road into the port.’ Another Afghan man, 38-year-old Sardar Wali, said: ‘The police do not stop us. Even if you get caught, the police let you go, and you can try again.’ Lorry driver Keith Taylor, 57, said he does not believe French police have any desire to stop migrants getting on to vehicles going to Britain, adding: ‘They just turn a blind eye. Why would they try to stop them? 'They do not want them living here. I do not stop my lorry here if I am on my way to Dover as it is too risky. If you stop anywhere, you know they will try and break in. Familiar tactic: A gang tries but fails to get into one lorry... ... so they race to try their luck on another . ‘Even if you drive straight into the port they can get on. They just walk straight through into the port and then when the lorries are backed up you are a sitting duck.’ Fellow driver Mick Short, 38, added: ‘It is dangerous what they are doing and being able to get away with. They need more police and better security to stop them. They can get on your lorry and you have no clue. ‘The problem is, if we get caught with one of them on the lorry we get fined £2,000 per immigrant. At the moment the policing in Calais is extremely light-touch. You hardly ever see them out on patrol.’ A French police spokesman said: ‘[The migrants] put themselves in extremely dangerous positions – this is the direct result.’ He refused to comment on ‘specific areas for operational reasons’, but said, ‘all areas are well covered to ensure maximum security’. But Philippe Mignonet, Calais’s deputy mayor, said he believes between ten and 30 stowaways cross the Channel each day. He told the Mail: ‘It’s a difficult situation. We know why these people are in Calais, they want to go to England.’ He called for Britain to add to the police presence in the area.","Migrants are risking their lives jumping onto lorries at Calais to enter UK .

"By . Francesca Infante . Disgraced: Karim Habibi leaving court this morning after pleading guilty to trying to abort his own child without the knowledge of his pregnant girlfriend . A father-to-be asked doctors to help him trick his girlfriend into taking a drug that would make her miscarry a court heard today. Karim Habibi, 26, wanted to trick his pregnant girlfriend Helen Dean into losing their child by slipping her a pill because he didn't want her to continue with the pregnancy. Newport Crown Court heard how the Afghan-born chip shop worker walked into his local GP’s surgery to ask a nurse to give him a tablet 'to stop his girlfriend’s pregnancy.' He even boldly told the 'amazed' practice nurse he intended to give her the abortion tablet without her knowledge. But she refused his request and reported Habibi to police. Prosecutor John Probert said Habibi had been in a relationship with Miss Dean since 2011 and had discussed starting a family together. Mr Probert said: 'Miss Dean took a pregnancy test in June 2012 which was positive and she excitedly telephoned her boyfriend. 'She said he seemed pleased and excited about the prospect of becoming a father. 'But two days later he went to his GP’s surgery and saw the practice nurse, who he asked to provide him with a tablet to stop Miss Dean’s pregnancy. 'He informed the practice nurse he intended to give her the tablet without her knowledge. 'The nurse refused the request and discussed with him the unethical and unlawful nature of his request.' Habibi, of Newport, South Wales, was said to be 'unhappy' with the response and left the the surgery empty-handed. Mr Probert said the nurse quickly told one of the GP partners - who tried to contact Habibi without success before telephoning police. The takeaway worker Habibi was quickly arrested but denied trying to abort his girlfriend’s baby without her knowing. He claimed the nurse had 'misunderstood' him and said he was in fact seeking medication for his own purposes. But on the first day of his trial shameless Habibi change his plea and admitted attempting to procure a posion to cause an abortion. Judge Gregory Bull QC told Habibi had had done something 'quite outrageous.' Sentencing him to 15 months imprisonment suspended for two years Mr Bull said: 'You behaved in a way that is not acceptable in this country or anywhere else. 'Your aim was to fool your girlfriend and cause her to take a tablet that would cause your son to be aborted. Fined: Habibi was sentenced to 15 months in prison suspended for two years and fined £1,200 at Newport Crown Court, pictured . 'That is a terrible thing to do. 'You didn’t show any pity for what you had done, you lied to the police and continued with your lies until this matter was to be tried. 'Luckily, you were never in a position to administer poison and therefore your girlfriend and her baby were not put in immediate danger. 'In passing sentence, I have to send a message out that what you did was wholly unacceptable.' Habibi was also made the subject of a restraining order against his ex-partner and their son for five years and was also ordered to pay £1,200 in prosecution costs.","Karim Habibi, 26, pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial to trying to poison his girlfriend so she would miscarry .

"By . Damien Gayle . A gargantuan asteroid which struck Australia more than 300million years ago changed the face of the Earth forever, a new study claims. The six-mile diameter asteroid left an impact zone more than 120 miles wide - the third largest such site on the planet - and likely led to mass extinctions worldwide. 'The dust and greenhouse gases released from the crater, the seismic shock and the initial fireball would have incinerated large parts of the Earth,' said Andrew Glikson, visiting fellow at the Australian National University. Gargantuan: Researchers have discovered the impact site of a six-mile wide asteroid which struck South Australia some 300million years ago and likely led to mass extinctions across the planet . He added: 'The greenhouse gases would stay in the atmosphere for tens of thousands of years.' Evidence of the ancient catastrophe was only discovered after another researcher alerted Dr Glikson to unusual mineral deposits in the East Warburton Basin in South Australia. As the ages have passed, the mammoth impact zone has been buried beneath nearly 2.5 miles of earth. To identify it Dr Glikson and his colleagues analysed quartz grains drawn from the site and studied underground seismic and magnetic anomalies. The strike may have been part of an asteroid impact cluster which caused an era of mass extinction, wiping out primitive coral reefs and other species, added Dr Glikson. However, he added, the impact happened well before the time of the dinosaurs. Known extent of the Warburton Basin based on the ¿C¿ seismic horizon: The Birdsville Track Ridge divides the eastern Warburton Basin, which underlies the Cooper Basin, from the Western Warburton Basin . 'It’s significant because it's so . large. It's the third largest impact terrain anywhere on Earth found to . date,' he told Australian science news site The Conversation. 'It’s likely to be part of a particular cluster that was linked with a mass extinction event at that time.' He said there was a chance that the incoming asteroid actually split in two as it made its fiery descent through the Earth's atmosphere. 'We are studying another anomaly in West Warburton that could well be its twin but we don’t know yet,' he said. Dr Simon O'Toole, research astronomer at the Australian Astronomical Observatory, told The Conversation that the find offered fresh evidence of the links between asteroid impacts and mass extinctions. 'Australia is a fantastic place for impact crater hunters because we have huge open space with nothing in it,' said Dr O'Toole, who was not involved in the research. 'It's huge,' he added. 'Most asteroid impacts are about 100m in diameter.' Dr Glikson is co-author of a study detailing the findings published in the journal Tectonophysics this month.","Six-mile wide rock hit 300million years ago and left 120 mile impact zone .

"By . Mark Prigg . A team of US university students have unveiled an audacious plan to become the fourth people in history to land a spaceship on the moon. The Penn State students say their project could even go one better - landing a craft that can take off and land at will, allowing it to explore the lunar surface easily. They hope to launch on a commercial spacecraft in 2015 - if they can raise enough money. Scroll down for video . How it will work -after launching on a commercial vehicle, the team hope to land on the lunar surface and send video and images from the surface . In December of 2015, the Lunar Lion lander will take off onboard a commercial launch vehicle. After cruising through space for five days, the spacecraft will land on the surface of the Moon, sending back high-res images and videos to Penn State’s mission control center. After this first lunar touchdown, the team will launch the Lunar Lion lander from the Moon’s surface and fly it to a second landing site. 'Moon missions take brains, and willpower, and usually the wealth of nations - until now,' the team says on its fundraising site. 'Brains are still needed. And willpower. Not nations, though. 'For the first time in history a group of students with a dream, a hell of a lot of support from their school, and your help, will land a spacecraft on the Moon.' The team are battling against far larget teams as part of a Google XPRIZE for the team to land on the moon. Once their craft has landed, they plan to beam back messages from supporters, while the craft will also be etched with the names of those who supported the project.

The Google Lunar XPRIZE aims to create a new “Apollo” moment for this generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $40 Million in incentive based prizes. In order to win this money, a private company must land safely on the surface of the Moon, travel 500 meters above, below, or on the Lunar surface, and send back two 'Mooncasts' to Earth . The team is confident it can win the Lunar Xprize, awarded to the first non-government group to land on the moon.

"By . Emma Innes . This is the touching moment the mother of one of Scotland’s youngest surviving babies got to hold her daughter for the first time. Claire Cressey said cuddling and kissing baby Emily - born at 24 weeks - was ‘the best moment of my life’. Ms Cressey, 34, from Coldstream, in the Scottish Borders, enjoyed a precious 20 minutes with her daughter on Mothering Sunday. Claire Cressey held her baby, Emily, for the first time on Sunday. Emily was born at 24 weeks and weighing just 1lb 3oz. Until now, she had been too vulnerable to be held . Emily was so premature that when she was born it would still have been legal for her to be aborted . Emily, who weighed just 1lb 3oz when she was born on February 27, was so premature she could legally have been aborted. But after receiving ‘fantastic’ care at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, she is thriving and now weighs just over 1lb 10oz. The mother-of-four admitted she was physically sick on Sunday morning because she was so worried something might go wrong when Emily was taken out of her incubator. But the planned 10 minute cuddle was stretched to 20 minutes because Emily responded so well to her mother’s touch, maintaining an even heart rate and temperature throughout. A delighted Ms Cressey said: ‘I’ve waited for over a month to be able to hold her and it is something I will remember for the rest of my life. Emily is now a month old and 1lb 10oz. She was briefly able to breathe on her own but now needs ventilation . ‘I cried before the nurse even took her out, it was so emotional, I’ve never experienced anything like it before. ‘She snuggled up to my chest and fell asleep, the nurses kept checking her heartbeat and temperature and they were fine so I got longer with her than expected.’ Ms Cressey added: ‘It was very scary. She is so tiny, she can fit in the palm of your hand. I was scared something might go wrong but she coped really well. ‘Actually holding her was quite a shock because it was only then that I realised just how tiny she is. ‘To me she is perfect and I’m very lucky.’ Baby Emily is being carefully watched and kept in a special incubator. Ms Cressey was able to hold Emily for 20 minutes as she maintained her temperature and heart rate well . Ms Cressey said: 'She snuggled up to my chest and fell asleep, the nurses kept checking her heartbeat and temperature and they were fine so I got longer with her than expected' Her father, Alan Coultas, was not able to visit his daughter on Sunday because the couple could not find anyone to look after their other children. They have to spend more than £110 a week making the 100 mile round trip to the hospital, parking, and paying for childcare. Kind-hearted members of the public are already donating towards the cost of visiting Emily. Ms Cressey said: ‘She came so early that any money we had saved has now been spent. At this moment we are having to choose between petrol and food.’ Ms Cressey arrived at the hospital with just minutes to spare before Emily was born after a four hour labour. Emily's parents have to make a 100 mile round trip to visit her in hospital . Emily's father, Alan, was unable to see her on Sunday as he couldn't find anyone to look after their other children . After the birth, Emily was rushed straight off to the neonatal unit and placed in an incubator. At three-days-old, Emily was able to breathe by herself and doctors put her on a lower dependency CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine. But ten days later, she started to struggle so doctors were forced to ventilate her again, a necessity not uncommon with babies born before 29 weeks.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A 3-year-old boy from Mississippi has been attacked and mauled to death by the family's two pit bulls, despite his mother's efforts to save him that left her injured. Sheriff Willie March says Christopher Malone was playing behind a mobile home in the rural Thornton community Monday near a chain-link pen where the two dogs were locked up. According to March, the dogs somehow managed to get out and attacked the toddler, who was pronounced dead on the scene from him wounds. Scroll down for video . Horrible death: Christopher Malone (left and right) was playing outside his home in Thornton, Mississippi, when the family's two pet pit bulls escaped from their enclosure and mauled him to death . Culprit: Mississippi News Now captured one of the pit bulls involved in the deadly attack being carried away by animal control officers . Malone's mother was hospitalized with injuries she suffered when she tried to pull the pit bulls off the child, Mississippi News Now reported. Both pets were later carried away by animal control officers. Their fate has yet to be determined. Thornton is about 10 miles southwest of Tchula and 16 miles west of Lexington, the county seat. Tragedy struck just after 4pm Monday as little Christopher was playing near the dog enclosure behind his home. ‘The dog just jumped him and took him down and dragged him in the back and killed him, ate him up,’ the victim’s aunt Lucy Mayze told the station. No one in the family witnessed the attack, but when Christopher's mother realized that the toddler was not in the house, she went outside to look for him and found the boy being ravaged by the two animals. Doghouse: The animals were said to be locked up in this chain-link pen when they somehow got out . Another loss: Christopher's family had just lost a grandmother in a house fire in January . Relatives say the pit bulls had never attacked anyone before and were not known to be aggressive. The news channel WAPT reported that the dogs have been raised by the family since they were puppies, and they were around children all the time, according to the family.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Cycling can be a serene way to spend a Sunday afternoon, until you arrive at a steep uphill climb and have to give it all the energy you've got just to get over it. With this in mind, researchers have created a bike wheel that not only knows when you're struggling, it will activate a built-in electric motor to give you a supportive boost of power. Called the Copenhagen Wheel, the device can be installed as part of a rear hub of any bike wheel and is fitted with a computer, rechargeable batteries and sensors that monitor how hard a rider is peddling. By connecting to a smartphone via Bluetooth, the wheel can then track distances and elevation and will switch the electric motor on and off to suit the terrain. Scroll down for video . The Copenhagen Wheel, pictured, can be fitted to any bike and syncs wirelessly to a smartphone. A built-in computer tracks how hard a rider is peddling, using distances travelled and elevation, and activates a motor to kick in if the cyclist is struggling uphill, for example . The Copenhagen Wheel is installed as part of a rear hub of a bike wheel and can connect wirelessly to a smartphone app. The device is fitted with a computer, batteries and sensors that monitor how hard a rider is pedalling. It does this by monitoring the energy output, as well as by tracking the rider’s GPS location and elevation via the app. A built-in motor will kick in whenever the wheel thinks the cyclist is struggling, when riding uphill for example. The smartphone can also track distance travelled and calories burned. The smartphone app can also track the number of calories burned and lock the wheel remotely as soon as the owner walks away from the bike. ‘The motor integrates itself with the rider's motion very, very seamlessly,’ said Assaf Biderman, who co-invented the device at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's SENSEable City Lab. ‘It's almost like having a riding companion riding together with you, making the ride easier, simpler.' By connecting to a smartphone app, pictured, via Bluetooth, the wheel can track distances and elevation and if it thinks the cyclists is struggling, up a hill for example, the built-in motor will kick in to give them a boost of power . The Copenhagen Wheel has enough power to propel a rider as fast as 37 mph. However, the developers have put speed limits in software to meet local cycling speed limits, effectively turning off the motor once the speed reaches 20mph in the U.S. and 15mph Europe. The concept was inspired by a simple question: ‘How can we get more people to cycle?’ said Biderman. The project received funding from the Italian ministry of the environment and office of the mayor of Copenhagen. Developers have put speed limits in software to meet local cycling speed limits, effectively turning off the motor once the speed reaches 20mph in the U.S. and 15mph Europe .

It does this by monitoring the energy output, as well as by tracking the rider's GPS location and elevation via the app . Fitted inside the wheel (from left to right) is a motor, a computer, and a rechargeable battery. There are also multiple sensors including a GPS unit and an accelerometer. The motor can reach speeds of up to 37mph . The first 1,000 Copenhagen Wheels became available for pre-order through the Superpedestrian website earlier this month and cost $699 (£429) each. According to the Superpedestrian site, at least 810 have already been sold. The Copenhagen Wheel does not replace a cyclist's existing bicycle, instead cyclists get the hubcap-sized device installed on a new rear wheel that fits their current bicycle. It is similar to the £340 FlyKy Smart Wheel.","The Copenhagen Wheel can be fitted to any existing bicycle .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Newly declassified documents have revealed that the American military was not ready to deal with an imminent threat in Benghazi on the night of the 2012 attack because they always operated under the assumption that host countries would protect diplomatic forces for a few hours attack should an attack occur. The hundreds of pages of declassified material are transcripts of hearings held by the House Armed Services Committee in the wake of the fatal attack that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others dead in the early hours of September 12. A general and top members of the Department of Defense revealed that while they relied heavily on the understanding that Libyan forces would come to the American consulate’s aid for long enough to scramble jets from other bases in the Middle East, they also did little to prepare for the anniversary of the September 11th terror attacks. Chaos: The House Armed Services has released hundreds of pages of transcripts from hearings about the security preparedness- or lack thereof- leading up to the September 11, 2012 attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi . ‘We actually did an analysis of since 9/11 of 2001, how many attacks that we have actually had on 9/11, the anniversary of 9/11. The answer is one, and it was September 11 of 2012,’ Major General Darryl Roberson told the committee in a hearing on May 21, 2013. ‘Prior to that event at Benghazi, there had not been an attack on 9/11 that (the Department of Defense) had to respond to in any way. ‘What we thought, which turned out tragically unreliable, was that the Libyan security force would provide a defense of our diplomats, as is done around the world everywhere, and that failed.’ Adding to the scramble was the fact that the closest team that could theoretically fly in to help the security forces at the Benghazi compound was in Tripoli. Two people from that six-person team . were immediately dispatched to Benghazi while the rest stayed in Tripoli . to maintain a secure presence there, said Garry Reid, the principal . deputy assistant secretary of Defense for special operations and . low-intensity conflict. ‘We didn't have a tactical setting to say let's get a military force in there now,’ Mr Reid told the committee. Expert opinion: Major General Darryl Roberson told the committee that earlier security analysis told Defense Department officials that September 11 was not a day that was picked for a terrorist attack except in 2001, meaning that an increase of security was not necessarily justified on that specific date . ‘By the time our forces were in a . position to be able to get into Libya and to do something everything was . coming out of Benghazi, everybody was retrograding to Tripoli. And so . we were working on getting the wounded out. We knew by then that the . Ambassador was dead, and that he was on his way from the hospital to the . airfield.’ Aside from that . six-man AFRICOM team in Tripoli, there were no f-16 fighter planes . anywhere near the Libyan attack zones and the closest air refuellers . that could ready other, closer planes were in England- a 10-hour flight . away. The logistics of the developing attack . also prompted hesitation on commanders’ parts because even if there was . a plane ready to send in an attack drone or drop mortar fire on the . terrorists because the targets were not clear. ‘We . didn't know who was friendly and who was enemy,’ Major General Roberson . said, going on to defend his commander, General Carter Ham who is in . charge of American forces throughout the African continent. Unprepared: Garry Reid, the principal deputy assistant secretary of Defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, said that there was no system in place that would allow Defense Department officials to send support immediately . 'There was no way that we would have been able to drop weapons in that environment, from a drone or from an airplane. All of this, given this environment, was considered by General Ham and dismissed fairly quickly. And personally, from my experience, I believe his decision was correct.’ One of the first fixes that was identified in the aftermath of the attack was a lack of marine security guards on the premises, and Major General Roberson said that the Department had 'made a commitment to increase the coverage' in light of the attack. 'They are not going to be out on the perimeter chasing bad guys down the street, they are defending the hard line, they are defending within our secure areas, defending our people, defending our diplomatic facilities,' he described. Dozens of pages of testimony remain redacted in the files, released today by the House Armed Services Committee. The hearings were done behind closed doors, as they gave the elected officials a chance to ask questions about the spread of military forces at the time of the attack. The volatility of the region- in light of the toppling of Qaddafi's regime months before- led to examinations of the security of the American consulate, including one spearheaded by Ambassador Chris Stevens. The members of the Armed Services Committee concluded that the Ambassador's suggestions would have come too late, as the terrorists struck before he had time to make the reforms. 'I know the ambassador had an effort in place to strengthen and have a diplomatic presence. It wasn't full-time. And to that he lost his life. No pretense that this is a full on operation on the diplomatic side whatsoever,' Congressman Andrews said. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was questioned- by both the House and Senate- in a far more public display that led her to scream at accusations that the State Department did not do enough by failing to question other evacuees as they left Libya in the days following the attack. ‘We had four dead Americans! Whether it was attack preplanned by terrorists or it because of a guy out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill Americans- what difference at this point does it make?!’ Mrs Clinton responded at her late January hearing. Angry: Mrs Clinton was extremely emotional throughout the nearly-three-hour-long hearing in January, which, unlike the hearings that were just declassified today, were televised . The May 21 House hearings that were just . declassified were part of a series that were held in order to try to . ascertain what failings allowed a group of armed terrorists to breach . the American consulate in Benghazi. The uncertainty surrounding the chain of events was also another major point of contention as White House officials blamed the attack on a video portraying Muslims in a bad light. The attack was later determined to be a pre-planned event, though the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made to date. ‘It is a very dangerous world. And we are present in many parts of that dangerous world,’ said Congressman Adam Smith, a ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, during the May 21 hearing. ‘And also, we should remember that in the days before the Benghazi attacks, there were attacks on a number of our embassies that were, ironically, in fact inspired by a video, in Cairo, in Sana' a, in Tunis, in Pakistan, and a lot of other places. The threat environment was very complex and very difficult.’","House Armed Services Committee held hearings about the security levels at the American consulate in Benghazi which have now been declassified .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A missing Northern California runner survived two days in a treacherous and snowy mountainous region by sleeping on a cliff and kept warm in freezing conditions by curling up in bushes, authorities said on Tuesday. Robert Root, 55, of Modesto, was wearing only a light jacket, shorts and running shoes when rescuers discovered him walking on a bridge on the Western States trail on Tuesday afternoon, Placer County sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said. Covered in metallic blankets and other warm materials, a disheveled and red-faced Root smiled at TV reporters after authorities slowly brought him down in an all-terrain vehicle from the snowy trail in the Sierra Nevada, about 200 miles east of San Francisco. Robert Root, 55, of Modesto, northern California, was wearing only a light jacket, shorts and running shoes when rescuers discovered him walking on a bridge on the Western States trail on Tuesday afternoon . ‘I'm grateful. Thank you very much,’ Root said as he was loaded into an awaiting ambulance. He was taken to a hospital in nearby Auburn and appeared to be in good condition, so he was hoping to go home by Tuesday evening, Erwin said. Root, who is known as ‘Bob,’ said he wanted an In-N-Out hamburger upon his release, Erwin said. ‘It's just amazing. He was found alive, alert and talking,’ Erwin said. ‘Just amazing.’ The news of Root's discovery spread quickly in Modesto, said Heidi Ryan, who belongs to the same running club as Root. ‘I feel like I'm still a little numb, but that's just me,’ Ryan said. ‘I'm still processing it.’ He was last seen on Sunday morning before he became separated from fellow members of the ShadowChase Running Club on the Western States trail in the Sierra Nevada . Root was last seen on Sunday morning before he became separated from fellow members of the ShadowChase Running Club along the trail near Foresthill. The group was training for the annual Western States Endurance run in June. Root was not going to participate in the race, Ryan said. The runners who were out on Sunday were split into fast and slow groups. Root was initially running with the slower group. When his group briefly stopped, Root decided to run ahead and join the faster group, but he took a wrong turn on the trail, Erwin said. An extensive search began on the rugged terrain, but it was suspended due to darkness and falling temperatures. Root ended up on a cliff overlooking the American River, where he scooted into some shrubbery for warmth and slept off and on throughout Sunday night, Erwin said. Root was found alive in snowy conditions, two days after he went missing near a trail in a mountainous region of Northern California, authorities said . More than 60 searchers resumed on Monday using motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, search dogs and two helicopters. Five members of the Tahoe Nordic Search Team spent the night looking for Root after snow began to fall earlier in the day. On Monday, Root spent the morning trying to find his way out, but he ended up back at the same spot, spending a second night in the same area, Erwin said. Root said he survived on energy supplements and a small amount of water he carried with him, and when he couldn't stop shaking, he compressed and released his muscles over and over to stay warm, she added. ‘He said his fingers were turning white and he would put them in his armpits to warm them up,’ Erwin said. Erwin said crews went looking for Root again on Tuesday. Root decided to head ‘up and west,’ and when he got to the El Dorado Bridge, he saw a couple of people wearing bright-colored uniforms he thought were searchers and walked up to them. Root said he wanted an In-N-Out hamburger upon his release from hospital . ‘They said, “Are you Bob Root?'"" Erwin said. ‘He said, “Yes, I am.'"" Ryan believes Root's training helped him survive. ‘He has great endurance and that obviously helped him,’ Ryan said. ‘I can't wait to hear what caused him to get off trail, but I'm so relieved that he's alive.’","Robert Root, 55, of Modesto, survived two days in a treacherous and snowy mountainous region .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Oprah Winfrey's former stepmother has been given more time to vacate the $1.4 million Nashville home the talk show host bought for her and her ex-husband to live in. Barbara Winfrey was married to Oprah's father Vernon for over a decade, but the bitter fight over the house has hung over the family since he filed for divorce in 2012. Following a court appearance on Monday, Barbara Winfrey now has two months to move out of the house in Franklin, Tennessee. Dispute: Barbara and Vernon Winfrey pictured in 2010. The couple divorced in 2012 . A spokesman for Oprah said that the talkshow hostâ€™s company has granted Barbara 60 days to leave following her request for more time. Last month, the 66-year-old said she will have nowhere to go once she is evicted from the house she has lived in for 13 years, and says she will be left with a bad credit rating that will prevent her renting a new home. 'I'm not trying to stay here [just] to . stay here,' Barbara Winfrey told the Tennessean. 'Where am I going to go at 66 to . find someplace to live? Who's going to rent to me?' After her husband filed for divorce, claiming inappropriate marital conduct, Barbara Winfrey made claims that Vernon, who is in his 80s, has been abusive to her. In a messy legal dispute, Barbara claimed Vernon cheated on her . for years with prostitutes including one named 'One Tooth', and . threatened to shoot her. She also claimed a woman tried to blackmail him over a sordid sex tape. Court date: Barbara Winfrey faces an eviction hearing on Monday over this $1.4 million home . Legal proceedings: A spokeswoman for Oprah, pictured here with her father Vernon, says the TV star offered Barbara several deals including a different property to live in . The judge ruling stated that the TV . talk show star purchased the property after . her father gifted it to another man, Tom Walker, who then defaulted on . the mortgage. 'The court . finds [Vernon Winfrey] allowed [the marital property] to go into . foreclosure knowing that it would be purchased by his daughter, Oprah, . for his and Thomas Walker's benefit and to defeat any interest of . Barbara Winfrey,' the ruling stated. At . the time of the hearing, a spokesman for Oprah told Radar she stepped . in because she didn't want her father's 'life work to be dissolved.' 'The . property was in foreclosure and when it went up for auction, Ms. Winfrey bid and got it because she didn't want her father's life work to . be dissolved,' the spokesman said. A source close to the family said at . the time Oprah had been stunned by her step-mother's allegations. 'The . idea that her father would conduct himself this way is very disturbing . to Oprah,' the source said. In . court papers seen by the New York Post, Vernon admitted having a . one-week affair with an unnamed woman, but said he apologized when his . wife found out. Family: Oprah with her father, Vernon, at an awards dinner in 1994 . Protective: Oprah is said to have been stunned by the allegations her stepmother made against Vernon, a Nashville barber . He and Barbara, a school teacher, married in 2000 and lived in the property she now faces being evicted from. As . part of the divorce deal, Barbara Winfrey was offered a different . property, in Chateau Valley, Nashville, for free but she chose not to . accept it. The deal to . move there allegedly included having to sign a confidentiality agreement . about Oprah but Barbara Winfrey said: 'I'm not going to sign anything.' A spokesman for Oprah said an offer was also put to the star's ex-stepmother to sell the house she is in and split the proceeds equally. But she turned that offer down too. 'After several requests to voluntarily vacate the property at . Willowbrooke Circle, the appropriate paperwork has been filed to have . her vacate the property,' the spokeswoman told the Tennessean. Barbara Winfrey claimed that she had never been offered money from the sale of the house, but said it was an offer she would now accept. She added that she wasn't trying to take anything from Oprah. 'It's not money. It's never been about money. If it had been about money, I would have taken it and run a long time ago.'","Barbara Winfrey has been given two months to leave marital home .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . An Egyptian farmer has been jailed for a year for naming his donkey after the country's former military chief who is running for president. Omar Abul Maged was accused of 'humiliating the military' for calling his animal Sisi after Abdel Fatah al-Sisi who led the overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Maged, 31, put a military-style cap on his donkey, covered it with a poster of al-Sisi and rode it through his village in protest against the decision to oust Morsi last summer. An Egyptian farmer (not pictured) has been jailed for a year for naming his donkey after the country's former military chief Abdel Fatah al-Sisi (right) who is now running for president . Police arrested Maged in September and, after spending six months in custody, was convicted by the Qena Misdemeanor Court on Sunday. Human rights groups have hit out at the sentence. Andalus Center for Tolerance and Anti-Violence Studies told the Egypt Independent that it 'raises doubts about the fairness of the judiciary system in Egypt'. The conviction comes after the judiciary last week sentenced 529 pro-Morsi Muslim Brotherhood defendants to death in a massive crackdown on government dissenters. Outrage: Supporters of the Egypt's ousted President Mohamed Morsi march in Cairo to protest the decision by former military chief Abdel Fatah al-Sisi  to run in upcoming presidential elections . The electoral commission announced on Sunday that Egypt's presidential election will be held in late May, finally setting dates for the crucial vote widely expected to be won by al-Sisi. The commission set the first round of voting for May 26 and 27, with results expected by June 5. If a second round is necessary it will be held by mid-month with results announced no later than June 26, the commission said. Al-Sisi sparked protests after announcing his bid for office, but is widely expected to win. His victory would restore a tradition of presidents from military backgrounds that Egypt had for all but one year since 1952, when officers overthrew the monarchy and became the dominant force in politics.","Omar Abul Maged called his animal Sisi after Abdel Fatah al-Sisi .

"By . Flora Bradley-watson . A planned £20 million film about Formula 1 legend Sir Jackie Stewart has been vetoed by his wife over scenes claiming she had an affair with another driver. Ewan McGregor had been tipped to play Sir Jackie in the Hollywood blockbuster, made by the couple’s friend William Pohlad, the director of Brokeback Mountain. It has been three years in development. The script focused on the close relationship between the Stewarts and Frenchman Francois Cevert – who died during a Formula 1 qualifying race in New York in 1973. Helen Stewart, centre, said a movie about husband Sir Jackie Stewart, right, has been shelved because filmmakers wanted to a plot line where she had an affair with the couple's close friend Francois Cevert . Lady Stewart refused to allow the affair plotline as it is not true but admitted it was 'probably the most exciting part of the film' Lady Helen Stewart told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It was going to be a big film – but they wanted to say that I’d had an affair with Francois Cevert... and I wouldn’t let them do it, because it wasn’t true.’ Lady Stewart, now 65, admitted the affair ‘was probably the most exciting part of the film – if it was true. But it wasn’t. Francois was a great friend of Jackie’s and of mine but they wanted to make something of it – which was crazy. ‘Francois was described as the most exciting man in France at that time. We had great fun with him, he loved the children, he loved everyone that we were with, he had a great girlfriend. 'But Jackie and I are childhood sweethearts and we have been happily married for 50 years. ‘I met Jackie when we were 16 and we got married when I was 21. We have two children together and nine grandchildren. Francois Cevert, pictured with Brigitte Bardot, was considered one of the most exciting men in France . ‘Anyway they’re not making the film. That’s the sole reason it’s scrapped – which seems a bit stupid to me . seeing as it’s not true in the first place.’ Last night a spokesman for Pohlad . declined to comment, but a source close to the film insisted that it was . still in development and Pohlad and Sir Jackie were still  in . discussions. The Oscar-nominated director was inspired to bring the story to the big screen after seeing how the couple were affected by the death of Cevert, whom Stewart mentored and saw as his successor on the Tyrrell team. Sir Jackie, 74, retired from racing after the crash that killed his friend. The two men had been so close that Cevert regularly stayed with the Stewarts at their home in Switzerland and it was said the couple treated him like a son. Sir Jackie and Lady Stewart are childhood sweethearts and have been happily married for 50 years . Brokeback Mountain director William Pohlad was involved in the Jackie Stewart film development . Last year Sir Jackie talked excitedly . about the film as a chance to pay  tribute to his protege. In an . interview, he said: ‘The film is about Helen and me and Francois, three . people going through an experience in life. It will be a Hollywood film. ‘We are involved in that I have read the . various scripts that have come through with Helen. We want accuracy, of . course, but there has to be entertainment as well. ‘It is not going to be a hardcore racing film. It is going to be a human story from 1970, when Francois came into the team, until he sadly died.’ If the film is scrapped, it leaves the path clear for a second production, Weekend Of A Champion, a documentary about the Grand Prix circuit in the early 1970s directed by Roman Polanski. It was shot as Sir Jackie prepared for the 1971 Grand Prix in Monaco and was first screened in 1972. But a re-edited and remastered version, comparing one of  the sport’s most  dangerous eras to the present day, premiered at  the Cannes  Film Festival last month. At the event, Sir Jackie recalled: ‘In those days, if you raced for five years, there was a two out of three chance you were going to die.’","Brokeback Mountain director William Pohlad had been in talks to direct film .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . An attorney for an Ohio death row inmate who underwent a slow, gasping execution with a new drug combination has been accused of coaching the condemned man to fake symptoms of suffocation. Dennis McGuire, 53, took 26 minutes to die - the longest execution of the 53 carried out . in Ohio since capital punishment resumed 15 years ago - which renewed questions about the death penalty. The Office of the Public Defender said Robert Lowe, one of McGuire's attorneys, was temporarily suspended last week but back at work Monday after a review failed to substantiate the allegation. State prison records released Monday say McGuire told guards that Lowe counseled him to make a show of his death that would, perhaps, lead to abolition of the death penalty. Execution: Death row inmate Dennis McGuire, pictured, became the first prisoner executed in the U.S. by the two-drug combination. Now his attorney has been accused of coaching the condemned man to fake symptoms of suffocation . Punishment: The death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Ohio used intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death . But three accounts from prison officials indicate McGuire refused to put on a display. 'He wants me to put on this big show in front of my kids, all right when I'm dying!' McGuire is reported as having told one guard. 'I ain't gonna do this. It's about me and my kids, not him and his cause!' Amy Borror, a spokeswoman for the public defender's office, said all accounts from execution eyewitnesses - which did not include Lowe - indicate McGuire was unconscious at the time he struggled to breathe. 'We have no way of knowing, obviously, because we can't interview Mr. McGuire,' she said. Upset: Amber McGuire, left, recounts the execution of her father, Dennis McGuire, as her sister-in-law Missie McGuire cries at a news conference on January 17. 'I can't think of any other way to describe it than torture,' Amber said . Borror said Lowe was not speaking with the media. He did not immediately return an email message or a phone message left at a number listed under his name. The office's director, Tim Young, told the Dispatch on Monday that no one in his office encouraged McGuire to fake any symptoms. Borror said Lowe walked McGuire through the steps involved in an execution and McGuire's statements may have arisen from an interpretation of those conversations. Borror said Lowe asked McGuire to give a thumbs-up during the execution as a way of determining when he lost consciousness. Due to ongoing federal litigation, she said the public defender's office closely monitors the sequence of events during the execution process. Prisons officials alerted Gov. John Kasich's lawyer the night before the execution that McGuire had been overheard telling family members he'd been 'encouraged to feign suffocation when the lethal injection drugs were first administered,' according to a statement released by the public defender's office. Victim: McGuire, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. The 22-year-old Stewart was newly married and pregnant . The investigation was first reported by The Columbus Dispatch. McGuire was put to death Jan. 16 for raping and killing a pregnant newlywed in 1989. He was executed with a combination of drugs - the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone - that had never before been used in the U.S. and his fitful final moments sparked criticism and calls for a death-penalty moratorium. Family members wept and later said the process amounted to torture; they have sued alleging undue cruelty. One report from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction suggests McGuire believed the signaling system he'd set up with his attorney - including the use of a thumbs-up gesture - could be used to save his life. The night before his execution, a corrections team leader reported being told by McGuire that he understood Lowe as saying 'if he started to choke or jerk in any way' the governor would put a stop to the execution. Experimental: McGuire was executed at this facility by Ohio's untested execution method . Two prison employees reported hearing McGuire say that, if it weren't for his daughter being present at his execution, he would 'really put on a show.' The public defender's office did not permit Lowe or any other staff from the public defender's office to witness the execution 'in order to avoid any appearance that OPD staff in any way influenced the execution process,' Borror said. Ohio has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the European manufacturer of the previous drug, pentobarbital, stopped allowing its use in lethal injections. Marketed in English-speaking countries and Mexico under the trade names Dormicum, Hypnovel, and Versed, midazolam is a short-acting sedative in the benzodiazepine class of drugs developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1970s. The drug is used for treatment of acute seizures, moderate to severe insomnia, and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures. It possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic, amnestic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. Hydromorphone is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class. It is a derivative of morphine. An expert in Dennis McGuire's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what's known as 'air hunger' or simply an acute shortness of breath. The clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one's breathing effort. It is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations. Reports from McGuire's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred. As such, the appropriateness of the drugs, and the extent to which they may be cruel, will likely be reviewed by Ohio officials before they are used in another execution.","Dennis McGuire, 53, took 26 minutes to die - the longest execution in Ohio since capital punishment resumed 15 years ago .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A New Jersey mother has given birth to a baby boy in a nail salon after going for a pedicure and foot massage after she was already in labor. Anna Rubinstein, 35, was not concerned about her son arriving any time soon when she went to Eden Nails in Glen Rock because she had been in labor for 42 hours when her daughter was born.

"By . Zoe Szathmary . The new away jersey for the United States men's and women's national soccer teams has been revealed in advance of the World Cup -- and fans are in an uproar. Designed by Nike, the jersey features three different-colored bands, starting at the top with blue, white, and red to represent the American flag, according to a company press release. The away kit also includes red shorts and red socks. However, fans have taken to Twitter to express their disapproval -- and many are comparing the new jerseys to the French flag, as well as those of the Netherlands and Russia. Scroll down for video . Clint Dempsey is seen sporting the new away kit, which some have compared to the both the French flag and even popsicles . The jersey's color scheme has caused outrage and confusion among fans . 'Is this April Fool's? Trying to look like France?' one fan wrote on Twitter in response to the colorful away kit . Not American? Former U.S. National Team Member Alexi Lalas seems to disagree with this dramatic pose . 'Is this April Fool's? Trying to look like France?' one user wrote. 'Away US soccer kit is alright but reminds me of France, Russia, Dutch. Not American and neither is that lighter blue! #USMNT' another tweeted. 'The new #usmnt jersey is basically the flag of France upside down...way to screw it up Nike,' one said. 'Wanna see the new #USMNT jerseys?  Google ""Netherlands Flag""' another user wrote. The famed French flag features panels of blue, white, and red going from left to right. The Dutch flag, however, features panels of red, white and blue going from top to bottom. The new away jersey has even been compared by USA Today to frozen popsicles. Women's team striker Sydney Leroux is seen wearing the new away kit...but does she resemble a Triple Rocket? NFL player Ndamukong Suh is even seen sporting the jersey and supporting the U.S. national teams . At least two noted players are fans of the jersey -- U.S. Men's National  Team Captain Clint Dempsey and Women's National Team striker Sydney Leroux. 'I like the patriotic design and color scheme and I think it will look great on the pitch,' Dempsey said, according to the Nike press release. 'Hopefully they will serve us well as we head into a competitive group.' 'The new kits fit really well, look great and most importantly, are really comfortable, especially when we are running all over the field for 90 minutes in all sorts of different weather,' Stryker said in the release. Both the French (left) and Dutch (right) away jerseys look rather different from the US one . Though some have compared the US away jersey to the Russian flag, the Russian jersey, seen here, looks rather different . Despite fans' objections, the away jerseys for three nations will look different from the ones for the US. The French away jersey is white with light gray stripes. The Dutch away jersey will be blue with an orange Netherlands badge. Both teams' jerseys are also designed by Nike. The Russian away jersey, designed by Adidas, features an outline of the earth, which looks like a series of blue stripes. A company press release says it is supposed to represent the view that Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, saw Earth in 1961. The rest of the jersey is white, with an emblem of the double-headed eagle. At least one fan seemed to have a hopeful approach to the new US jersey on Twitter. 'So the new USA home and away kits are absolutely terrible...but you know what makes a good kit is a kit you win in #USMNT.'","New jerseys from away kit feature top-down colored bands in blue, white and red .

"By . John Hall . A secret underground bunker built to protect essential services in the event of a nuclear war is to go under the hammer. The bunker, which was constructed in Coswarth in Cornwall at the height of the Cold War, was built so experts at the then South West Water Authority would be able to maintain water and sewerage operations during a nuclear emergency. The 3,000 square foot bunker, built in 1978 to house 16 people - seven in the operations room, six in the communications room and three in the control room, has a guide price of £50,000.

Brian Blake, South West Water's asset performance manager, worked for the Authority at the time and can recall visiting the bunker as it was being prepared for potential habitation. 'I remember that the Government said we had to provide an underground control centre in case of emergency which was bomb and nuclear proof,' he said. 'It wasn't fully kitted out as there was no furniture in there, but if something had happened you could have lived in there for weeks.'

The bunker and adjacent land eventually sold for £140,000, nearly three times the asking price . Chris Shapland, the Authority's property manager, added: 'We regularly auction redundant assets to reduce our costs and keep customers' bills as low as possible, but this is the first time we've offered a genuine piece of Cold War history.' 'Novelty sites with small areas of surplus land always attract strong interest as people are able to invest relatively modest sums for their 'little bit of England',' he added. Mr Shapland said several of the Authority's former storage reservoirs and pumping stations have already been converted by their new owners into unusual homes. Speaking of the new bunker's sale he added: 'It will be interesting to see what happens to the bunker - you never know who could end up using it.' The bunker and some adjacent land will be sold at auction on March 25.","Bunker was built in 1978, at the height of the Cold War, to protect services .

'So please, if anyone saw my son, please come forward. Somebody, somewhere knows something - no matter how insignificant you think it is, please inform the police. 'This maniac is still out there.'

Such was Porush's unhappiness at the film that he threatened to sue over it. Because of that, Hill's name is Danny Azoff in the film. Producers changed the name after Porush threatened to sue.

Little Corbin's big adventure: This Chihuahua-Dachsund mix escaped from a backyard in Killeen, Texas, and somehow ended up in Hamilton, Ohio, 1,000 miles away . Wanted: A surveillance camera outside the Animal Friends Human Society captured this woman leaving Corbin tied to a bench outside in the pouring rain . Powerful message: Corbin's owner Mike Saiz shared his story on Facebook, which sparked an outpouring of support from people offering help . 'It sounds like one of those too-good-to-be-true stories,' Corbin's owner, Mike Saiz, told The Cincinnati Enquirer. 'This isn't the first time he dug a hole under the fence. 'One time he was waiting for us on our front porch and the other two times we had to pick him up from the local pound.' A surveillance camera at the Animal Friends Humane Society in Hamilton caught a woman leaving Corbin at the shelter late Friday night. Corbin was in good shape, just soaking wet from rain and a little scared, said Kurt Merbs, supervisor of Butler County's dog warden's division. Good Samaritan: Sherrie Thornton picked up Corbin from the shelter to prevent him from being put up for adoption . Do-gooders: Thornton put the dog owner in touch with Mary and Shawn Davis (left), who live in Killeen, Texas, but were in Ohio for a funeral,  and who agreed to bring Corbin home . Authorities are hoping to identify the woman and see if they can get answers about how Corbin ended up in Ohio and at the shelter, Merbs said Wednesday. The staff located Saiz after finding a microchip on him that contained his owners' information. 'They called my wife and she told me that they found our dog, but she didn't sound happy about it,' Saiz said. 'I asked if he was OK and she told me he was fine. I then asked where the shelter was and she said, ""Hamilton â€” not Hamilton, Texas, but Hamilton, Ohio.""' Saiz and the Texas-based news station KCEN shared Corbin's tale on Facebook, which sparked an outpouring of messages from people all across the country offering help. Awaiting reunion: Saiz and his wife, Nani (left) are expected to be reunited with their beloved pup soon . Eventually, Saiz got in touch with Ohio resident Sherrie Thornton who, in turn, helped him reach out to Mary and Shawn Davis. The Davis couple are from Killeen, Texas, but they happened to be in Springfield, Ohio, for a funeral, and agreed to take Corbin to his owner. On Wednesday afternoon, Mrs Davis posted photos of the globe-trotting chiweenie and an update stating that they are on their way to Texas.","The 3-year-old Corbin escaped through a hole dug his backyard in Killeen, Texas, and turned up five days later 30 miles outside of Cincinnati .

"By . Sam Webb . England boss Roy Hodgson has changed his plans over an official trip for players' wives, families and girlfriends to the World Cup warm-up camp in Miami at the start of June. It had been planned that time would be set aside for the 'WAGs' - wives and girlfriends - after the first friendly against Ecuador on June 4. However, it has now emerged the players will instead fly to Miami on Sunday June 1, a day later than originally planned, and that time will be given over to their families. England players' significant others, like Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen Rooney, will be able to visit players in June but there will be no official visit . The Football Association's original plan had been to organise a visit for the families to Florida, but it is understood that will now not take place. The timetable will now see England play Peru at Wembley on May 30, have the following day with their families and then join up again with the squad on June 1 to fly to Miami. Hodgson, however, will not ban players from making their own arrangements for their families or partners to travel to Miami or after that to Brazil, but any time spent together then will have to fit in with training and match schedules, and any other England duties. England boss Roy Hodgson has changed his plans over an official trip for players' wives, families and girlfriends, it has been reported . Goalkeeper Joe Hart's girlfriend Kimberly Crew could take advantage of being allowed to spend time with each other ahead of the World Cup. The whole issue of the WAGs has been controversial since the 2006 World Cup, when there was criticism that the high-profile antics of players' loved ones at the Baden Baden base was a distraction for the team. Frank Lampard and Christine Bleakley at the Hakkasan restaurant, London, earlier this month . Former England manager Fabio Capello went in the opposite direction for the 2010 tournament in South Africa and restricted the time that players could spend with their families to short windows of opportunity. There will be two friendlies in Florida, the second against Honduras on June 7, before England fly to their World Cup base in Rio de Janeiro ahead of their first match of the tournament against Italy in Manaus on June 14. Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen is among the most prominent of the England team's WAGs. Goalkeeper Joe Hart's girlfriend Kimberly Crew, defender Phil Jones's partner Kaya Hall and midfielder Frank Lampard's television presenter fiancee Christine Bleakley could all take advantage of being allowed to spend time with their partners ahead of the World Cup. Defender Glen Johnson's wife, Laura, was among the WAGs who made an appearance in Poland during Euro 2012. But captain Steven Gerrard's model wife, Alex, and their three daughters, will not be making the trip across the Atlantic. He did not invite his family to South Africa for the last World Cup in 2010, and revealed last month that he has made the same decision for Brazil. The midfielder said he will sacrifice spending time with his family so he can concentrate on football, and plans to stay in touch by telephone and on the internet.","Official families' visit to Florida will not go ahead, it has been reported .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . The scandal-hit mayor of Washington DC Vincent Gray has conceded defeat in Tuesday’s election to choose the Democratic candidate to enter the general election in November. The District of Columbia's Democratic mayoral primary was instead won by Muriel Bowser after an election season defined by a scandal involving Gray's campaign four years ago. Bowser tapped into an electorate that had grown tired of the allegations surrounding Gray, whose associates have been convicted of involvement in an illegal slush fund that aided his 2010 campaign. The scandal-hit mayor of Washington DC Vincent Gray has conceded defeat in Tuesday¿s election to choose the Democratic candidate to enter the general election in November . Turnout on Tuesday was low, but close to midnight and with nearly 90 percent of precincts reporting, Bowser led Gray 44 to 33 percent, according to the D.C. Board of Elections. Gray conceded soon after those results came in. A little before 11:30 p.m., Bowser had addressed her watch party, asking volunteers - some of whom had been with her since a 5:30 a.m. rally - whether they were ‘tired.’ They replied in the negative. ‘I’m not tired either!’ she said with a grin, adding: ‘Friends, will you wait with me a few more moments?’ Bowser is a D.C. council-member and a protege of former Mayor Adrian Fenty, whom Gray defeated in 2010. D.C. Mayoral candidate, and Council Member Muriel Bowser celebrates as she walks onstage to address supporters at her election night watch party to await the Democrate Primary results in Washington on Tuesday . She will face independent D.C. Council-member David Catania in what could be an unusually competitive general election in November. The Democratic primary winner has gone on to win every general election since the district began electing a mayor 40 years ago. Bowser had relentlessly sought to make the campaign a referendum on Gray’s ethics. The defining moment of the election season in the nation's capital came when U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen said last month that Gray knew about an illegal, $668,000 ‘shadow campaign’ that helped propel him into office four years ago. Despite denials from the mayor, who has not been accused of a crime, the revelation further damaged an incumbent whose support had already eroded amid a long-running federal investigation. Bowser had relentlessly sought to make the campaign a referendum on Gray's ethics . The large field, weak incumbent and early April 1 date had made the primary unusual. In the past, the city has selected a Democratic nominee in September, followed by a two-month victory lap and a mostly ceremonial general election. Three out of four registered voters in the city are Democrats. Five people involved with Gray's 2010 campaign have pleaded guilty to felonies, but the mayor has denied all wrongdoing. The most recent was Jeffrey Thompson, a businessman and government contractor who admitted in court three weeks before the primary that he set up the $668,000 slush fund. The mayor said the crimes committed by others during his campaign did not bleed over into his administration, and he'd asked voters to focus on his accomplishments. Councilmember Muriel Bowser, left, talks to a supporter of current Washington DC Mayor Vince Gray after voting in the District of Columbia Democratic mayoral primary election at Lasalle Elementary School in precinct 65 in Washington . Even some critics concede he's done a good job running the city - which is enjoying a robust economy, surging population and improving schools - and polls show a disconnect between voters' negative perception of Gray and their sunny outlook on the district's progress. 'If you look at an airplane analogy, he's been a good pilot, he's flying the plane well, but there's this fundamental question about whether he deserved to be in the cockpit in the first place,' said Tony Bullock, a federal lobbyist who was the communications director for former Mayor Anthony Williams. Bowser had said it was impossible to separate Gray's performance in office from questions about how he got there. Voters 'want their mayor to be able to focus on the issues that affect them,' she said, and 'not on his own legal battles.'","Scandal-hit Washington DC .

"By . Tara Brady . At a casual glance, you might have thought that the Scottish Nationalists had chosen today to unleash a torrent of new plans for their country if September's referendum on independence goes their way. From plans for a new flag, to a new pound coin, new road laws and even a new monarchy, this morning's papers were full of policies fleshing out what the new nation might be like. But not so fast. It is, of course, April 1 - and the plans being unveiled were nothing more than elaborate April fool's pranks. Banishing the blue: How the new Union Jack will look, according to secret Government documents . Iconic: The flag that has been famous for more than 200 years . Flagged up: An aide accidentally shows papers detailing the plan as he steps out of a car . The Daily Mail led the way, with its story about what the Union flag would look like if Scotland casts itself adrift. According to Secret Government papers, it claimed, the cross of St Andrew, a white X on a blue background that makes up a third of the current design, could be ditched. That would leave a modified Union Jack comprising only the red cross of St George – representing England and Wales – and the red saltire of Ireland’s St Patrick. Meanwhile the Guardian made the unlikely - and downright dangerous - claim that an independent Scotland would embrace . driving on the right to show the country is 'part of Europe'. Scot-free! How the Daily Mail revealed what the Union flag would look like if Scotland votes ¿yes¿ . It said that Scottish nationalist leaders were attempting this week to give the trailing yes campaign a boost by revealing a series of measures aimed at showing what an independent country would look like. Seeking to capitalise on the arguments this week about 'bullying' England and keeping the pound, they will unveil an ambitious scheme to scrap the current – English inspired – road signage system. Fighting for independence: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond with a Scottish flag . The Guardian's feature claimed the country would embrace driving on the right side of the road . M for motorway will be replaced with a new S – for Scotland and the A trunk roads will become N roads – for Nationalist in honour of the new country. Blue will be the predominant backing colour. The Times continued the Scottish theme with its spoof. It claimed that the German Duke, His Royal Highness Ferdinand, descended from the last Stuart king and would have a claim to the throne of an independent Scotland. The Times claimed a German Duke would have a claim to the throne of independent Scotland . Quotes from a source said: 'These are tricky legal waters... If we revert to a Scotland that, constitutionally at least, we last saw in the 1600s, it does seem the Stuarts have rather more of a right to reign than a Windsor.' The name of the Dublin University expert, Amadan Giblean, is a Gaelic translation of April Fool. The Daily Telegraph said plans have been unveiled for a new Scottish pound coin in the event of a victory for the Yes campaign in September's referendum. The Daily Telegraph reported how plans had been unveiled for a new Scottish pound which would feature the face of Alex Salmond . 'The plan' would be introduced on April 1, 2015, and the head of Scotland’s First Minister would replace the Queen. Some papers did look beyond Scotland for their joke stories, however. The Sun ran with the Queen has given 'her royal seal of approval' to prospectors for fracking in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. According to The Sun, the Queen has given 'her royal seal of approval' to fracking at Buckingham Palace . 'Fracking could reduce rocketing utility bills that cost the royals up to £3.1 million a year,' the paper said. 'A palace source said: 'Even Prince Charles is convinced.'""

Meanwhile, the Metro revealed how national treasures Ant and Dec had confirmed their split after falling out in a north London branch of IKEA. The Metro revealed how national treasures Ant and Dec had confirmed their split . It said that the presenting duo, whose friendship stretches back 25 years, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms as Dec prepares to launch a solo career with the pair's old management team. ‘Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have gone their separate ways after a long and successful entertainment career as a double act,’ their spokesperson Flora Lopis confirmed. ‘Dec will now be known simply as Dec and is excited to get back to work as soon as possible. He is already looking into future projects and has signed up for a new series of Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.’ The Express revealed how Arsenal and Tottenham have sealed a deal for a groundshare at the Emirates . The Express claimed to have an exclusive revealing how Arsenal and Tottenham have sealed a deal for a groundshare that will see both teams play their home games at the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal agreed to the stunning collaboration after crunch talks with Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, it was said. But claims that the Emirates' 60,000 seats will alternate between red and white from game to game were unlikely to go down well with supporters either. King's College Choir in Cambridge even joined in the fun. In a clip posted on YouTube, chaplain Rev Richard Lloyd Morgan said young boys were no longer singing in the choir and therefore choral scholars would have to revert to using helium balloons. Mr Lloyd Morgan said: 'The complexity of the regulations involved mean that it really is no longer practical to have young boys singing in the choir and this is a great shame because high male voices have been part of the choir’s sound for more than 500 years. 'After a lengthy consultation process during which we learned that the surgical solution was surprisingly unpopular with the choral scholars, somebody in the chemistry department came up with a very simple solution and now all we need is a very large tank of helium.' Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, arriving for his first day to study Agricultural Management at the University of Cambridge . Prince William found himself on the receiving end of an April Fool's joke yesterday with a report he had ended his Cambridge University degree - with a lowly third. The Duke of Cambridge has been studying agricultural management at the historic university since January. His ten-week course has been interrupted by royal duties in the UK and abroad. Student newspaper The Tab claimed Wills graduated with a third-class honours degree - putting him in the bottom 15th per cent of attendees. As part of the prank they claimed the new father 'quickly began to struggle with combining the student and the regal life'. They superimposed the Prince's head on a body wearing a Cambridge gown holding his mocked-up degree certificate. The Tab quoted a fictional Director of Studies, Dr Canniedo, saying: 'It was always difficult for Prince William to balance his royal and family obligation with his studies. 'We did everything we could to help him in this regard. Student newspaper The Tab claimed William graduated with a third-class honours degree . 'While I cannot compromise student confidentiality, William was, needless to say, unaccustomed to mingling with students from different backgrounds. 'His tutor and I are disappointed with the result, but wish him well in the future.' At the end of the tounge-in-cheek article on cambridgetab.co.uk the writers admitted the result was just an April Fools prank.","Scotland’s independence vote inspired pranksters across the British press .

"By . Emma Glanfield . and Lillian Radulova . A British nuclear submarine was today scouring the Indian Ocean as part of the desperate search to find Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The Royal Naval vessel is part of a huge international effort to trace the missing plane, which vanished with 239 passengers and crew on March 8. Today it emerged that Hobbit director Peter Jackson has sent his $80million private jet to scour vast swathes of the area where it is believed the plane went down. Search teams hampered by terrible weather conditions and little information are now battling against the clock as the batteries in the beacon have a 30 day life span. It is 26 days since the Boeing 777 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Royal Navy submarine HMS Tireless, which is said to have 'advanced underwater search capabilities', has arrived in the southern Indian Ocean to help in the search for the missing flight MH370 . Royal Navy survey ship HMS Echo is also helping to search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 which disappeared on March 8. The extensive search area is currently focused off the coast of Western Australia . There are currently seven countries assisting in the search including New Zealand, Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and the United States with investigations being led by Malaysia. Last night, the Ministry of Defence confirmed HMS Tireless – a Trafalgar Class submarine - had arrived in the southern Indian Ocean and begun work. ‘She was ordered to move from an operational tasking to the search area around a week ago and arrived on station yesterday’, an MoD source said. ‘HMS Tireless holds advanced search capabilities, but the task in hand remains a tall order and the search area is immense. Her deployment is being co-ordinated closely with our Australian and US colleagues.’ The Royal Navy vessel HMS Echo is also part of the search, which is focussed on an area spanning 98,000 square miles (15,770km). Britain is also helping with technical assistance and specialist capabilities from across the Ministry of Defence, the Hydrographic Office, Department for Transport and the Met Office to help try to find flight MH370. Gulfstream G650: LOTR director Peter Jackson boards his $80 million plane which is now being used in the search effort for missing MH370 . Towed pinger locator: the device is used to detect black box recorders and will be fitted to the Australian  Ocean Shield warship to help locate missing airline MH370 by detecting noises made by the planes locator . As of Tuesday, there were ten planes and nine ships working in the region, 1,217miles (1,960km) west of the Australian city of Perth. One of these is Peter Jackson’s long-range business jet, a Gulfstream G650 which can carry eight passengers and a crew of four. It has a non-stop distance of 8,000miles (12,964km) and is considered to be able to fly further and faster than some military aircraft. 'Peter would not seek publicity for something like this and would actively avoid it in fact,' his spokesman Matt Dravitzki told the New Zealand Herald. 'A lot of civilian and military aircraft are involved in the search and it's kind of disappointing that because one is owned by a celebrity it becomes a matter of news when there are [over] 200 people missing.' The jet, which Sir Peter purchased last March, is primarily being used to help relay communications between other vessels involved in the search. The British submarine as well as an Australian ship the Ocean Shield are focusing on detecting pings emitted by MH370’s locater, which is attached to the flight data recorder. It can be heard up to two nautical miles away but this is only in good conditions. The search for the aircraft will continue long after the batteries on the locater run out but tracking the signal is the most efficient way of finding a downed plane. Relatives of the missing passengers and crew have faced an agonising wait for news and have been scathing of the Malaysia government’s efforts at handling the crisis. Yesterday, Malaysian officials said investigators were conducting a forensic examination of the final recorded conversation between ground control and the cockpit, after it changed its account of the final voice transmission from the missing plane. Autonomous underwater vehicle: Another device ready to be fitted to the Australian Ocean Shield to help locate the drowned plane. Tracking the signal of a flight data recorder is the most efficient way of finding a plane underwater . Unloading of resources by the Australian Navy: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the search for MH370 will continue despite any difficulty, adding: 'If this mystery is solvable, we will solve it.' Australian Seahwak helicopter being unloaded to help in the search: . International Air Transport Association director general Tony Tyler said the search is ""a reminder that we can never be complacent on safety. The government had transcribed the final voice transmission received by ground controllers at Kuala Lumpur's international airport as ‘All right, good night’, but last night it released a transcript of the conversation which noted the final words as: ‘Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero.’ Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said despite the search for the aircraft being slow, difficult and frustrating, it will continue indefinitely. He said the intensity and magnitude of operations ‘is increasing, not decreasing’, and added: ‘If this mystery is solvable, we will solve it.’ International Air Transport Association (Iata) director general Tony Tyler said there is ‘disbelief’ that flight MH370 ‘could simply disappear’ and a plane must ‘never again go missing in this way’. The Air France 447 incident, when a plane crashed into the Atlantic in June 2009 claiming 228 lives, had ‘brought similar issues to light a few years ago and some progress was made’. He added: ‘But that must be accelerated. We cannot let another aircraft simply vanish.’ Mr Tyler added: ‘In 2013, there were over 29 million flights operated on Western-built jet aircraft, with 12 hull losses. That is one accident for every 2.4 million flights and a 14.6% improvement on the five-year industry average. ‘Accidents are rare, but the current search for MH370 is a reminder that we can never be complacent on safety. It may well be a long time before we know exactly what happened on that flight.’ The Australian Defense ship, the Ocean Shield, is being fitted with devices which will help in the search efforts for the missing airline, by detecting the ping noises emitted from the airlines locator . Buddhist monks at a temple in Kuala Lumpur pray for the missing people aboard MH370. The transcript of transmissions from the cockpit have now been released and confirmed to have ended with: 'Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero.' Malaysian aircraft prepare to continue their search. Seven other nations are currently assisting in the search including New Zealand, Australia, China, Japan, Britain, South Korea and the United States.

He was later sent a £100 fine but has now won a court battle against the car park operators . After sending four further warnings to Mr Hotchin and his wife bosses at car park firm Parking Eye launched a court action to get the money. But a judge threw out the claim because the 31 minutes the pair from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, spent driving around the car park in May last year did not classify as 'parking'. He said: 'We were very surprised. We thought it was unfair considering we’d never even parked up. We were just circling the car park looking for a space. 'My wife didn’t want to go to court and found it all very intimidating but at this stage it wasn’t really about the money. We felt like we were being bullied if anything.

The site 100 miles south of Berlin was built to hold 10,000 prisoners of war during World War Two . This is a shot of the entrance of the Harry tunnel which captured the hearts of the world when it emerged . A commemorative stone has been laid over the track listing the names of the men who concocted the idea . As the 77th man exited the tunnel, . they were spotted by a guard who alerted the rest of the camp and 73 of . the escaped prisoners were captured. Fifty of those were shot. An RAF spokesperson said:  'There are 50 current serving RAF personnel currently walking towards Poznan, which is the final resting place for Sqn Ldr Roger Bushell, who was the mastermind for the Great Escape; when these personnel are walking on busy main roads, which are not closed to traffic, they are wearing hi-vis jackets to ensure they reach their destination safely.'","Ordered to wear high-vis vests over their fatigues due to health and safety .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Horrific: Curtis Echols was a beloved figure in his southeastern Memphis neighborhood. The cancer survivor was dragged to death in a hit and run jjust yards from his home . A 59-year-old cancer survivor beloved by his Memphis neighbors was killed late Saturday when a driver smashed into him on a sidewalk, dragged him through a front yard and left him to die in the street just yards from his home. Curtis Echols' cane, shoes and feeding tube lay at his side after a Chevy Malibu allegedly driven by 21-year-old Curteria Leuellyn sped away from the grim scene. The horrifying death leaves a void in the Orange Mound neighborhood that won't soon be filled. Echols' neighbor Randy Norris had the misfortune of seeing his friend's terrible death. 'A . loud boom,' Norris told WREG. 'They came through the fence and ended up . on the sidewalk. They started the car up and took off.' Norris, like most folks in the area of Orange Mound in southeast Memphis who knew Echols, has been left devastated. 'I hardly got any sleep,' he said. 'He was my best friend. We did everything together. He wasn’t supposed to go like that.' Echols' niece Shalanda Echols felt the irreparable loss, as well, and was most . struck with the bitter irony of her uncle's surviving throat, tongue and . prostate cancer 'only to be run over, taken out this way.' 'He went a way that he should not have went and I am really going to miss him,' said Shalanda.

They also vowed to find the people or person responsible for their friend's death. On .

"By . Jill Reilly . A Harvard student has written a damning open letter attacking the University’s indifference to an alleged sexual assault from another student. The girl, who is anonymous, posted the letter on The Harvard Crimson's website after becoming frustrated at what she perceives as the Ivy League university's lack of support, alleging she was discouraged from pursuing charges, which meant she had to continue living in the same dorm as her attacker. The student writes in the letter titled 'Dear Harvard: You win' that the alleged incident happened in a friend's dorm room on a Friday night 'after too many drinks'. Scroll down for video . A Harvard student has written a damning open letter attacking the University's indifference to an alleged sexual assault from another student . She said the attacker took her shirt off and started biting her skin. 'I pushed back on his chest and asked him to stop kissing me aggressively. He laughed. He said that I should 'just wear a scarf' to cover the marks. He continued to abuse my body.' 'I was intoxicated, I was in pain, I was trapped between him and the wall, and I was scared to death that he would continue to ignore what I said. I stopped everything and turned my back to him, praying he would leave me alone.' Students walk in front of the John Harvard statue on the Harvard University campus. The student claims she was discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because her assault did not fit the narrow language of Harvard's student handbook (file photo) She writes how he started getting impatient and made an explicit demand to which she wrote: 'It did not sound like a question. I obeyed.' The student then writes that she was discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because her assault did not fit the narrow language of Harvard’s student handbook which was written in 1993. 'When I told my House Master that I was considering an Ad Board process, I was told it was a bad time of the semester, that there would be consequences for my assailant anyway, and that we shouldn’t go through the process if it was going to be fruitless. 'Shortly after, my resident dean told me that my assailant couldn’t be punished because he didn’t know what he was doing. The resident dean compared living in the same House as my assailant to a divorced couple working in the same factory.' She explains that although she was offered the chance to move to another House early on she declined because 'transferring felt utterly disempowering. Moving to a different House would have felt like giving up and granting even more power to my assailant.' She also explains she wanted to be near her friends and tutors and details how she is now on anti-depressants and is now falling behind on her school work because she finds it difficult seeing her alleged attacker up to five times a day . 'I spend most of my time outside of class curled up in bed, crying, sleeping, or staring at the ceiling, occasionally wondering if I just heard my assailant’s voice in the staircase.' The student says since the incident she . has spent 'most of 2013 fighting the Harvard administration so that they . would move my assailant to a different House, and I have failed . miserably.' But after her ordeal she writes: 'I will be moving out of my House next semester, if only—quite literally-to save my life.' According to the Centers for Disease Control, 19 percent of undergraduate women experience attempted or completed sexual assault since starting college. According to AAUW 42 per cent of college women who are raped tell no one about the assault. They state that 'While there are many reasons why people do not report, the most often cited reason in a 2009 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity was institutional barriers on campus. Two examples of these institutional barriers are administrators who respond to students with disbelief or other inappropriate behavior, and campus judiciary processes that are difficult to understand and follow. Many students who were discouraged because of these barriers transferred or withdrew from their schools, while their alleged attackers were almost uniformly unpunished.'

"By . Dan Bloom . Many of us would find looking round our great-great-great-grandmother's house a bit of a drag - if she wasn't Queen Victoria. Prince Edward has returned to a modest cottage which the monarch used to teach her nine children about 'normal' life, including cooking, growing vegetables and selling the spoils at market prices (albeit to Prince Albert). The Swiss chalet at Osborne House, Queen Victoria's private home on the Isle of Wight, was where her children spent up to five months a year catching butterflies, having tea parties and operating a steam engine. Family heirlooms: Prince Edward and Sophie Countess of Wessex have visited Osborne House, Queen Victoria's favourite getaway for herself and her nine children on the Isle of Wight and overlooking the Solent. The sprawling estate hosts a new exhibition on life in a small chalet where the queen's children learned about 'normal' life . Normal life: The Queen would leave her nine children to their own devices in this Swiss chalet, which has been the focus of a £1.7m conservation and history project by English Heritage and hosts a new exhibition on what life may have been like as a Royal child. Pictured centre: The Earl and Countess of Wessex . 'Looks normal to me!' Many people would find looking around their great-great-great-grandmother's cottage a boring task, but not so for Prince Edward . Stern: Formally-dressed Royals gather round Queen Victoria, centre, in a suitably dour tea party as Osborne House. By this time she was wearing her customary black . Happy: Queen Victoria, left in 1890, spent many happy months at Osborne with Prince Albert. The photo right was taken at the Isle of Wight estate in May 1854 . The Earl and Countess of Wessex visited today after English Heritage finished a £1.7million conservation project at the cottage. Almost a mile out of sight of the grand home, secreted away near Queen Victoria's private beach, the children would be left to their own devices there for days on end. It was built for them in 1854 and joined only by the caretakers Mr and Mrs Warne, plus occasionally their governesses, they used it to learn skills used by people up and down Victorian Britain - not that they would ever need them. Project historian Andrew Hann told MailOnline: 'The children, particularly the girls, did a lot of cooking - they cooked cakes and biscuits and other treats which were then served to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. 'They also did gardening and grew maize, carrots and all the things you would expect. 'Their vegetable patches were arranged by age, with Princess Victoria's at the far left and Princess Beatrice's at the far right. They were all exactly the same size and Prince Albert would buy the vegetables back off them at market prices to teach them the value of money. Humble: The timber chalet may be impeccably-finished but it was modest by Royal standards, with space only for the live-in caretakers and the children . Not your average summer house: Prince Edward and Sophie leave the Swiss chalet today after re-opening it following a £1.7million project by English Heritage . Not quite an Alpine view, but still pretty: The cottage is near the coast of the Isle of Wight and Queen Victoria's private beach, which looked out over the Solent . 'He had been raised in Germany with a Swiss chalet, and wanted to repeat his childhood for his children. It was all Albert's idea to make them more competitive. 'We found one occasion in the children's letters where Prince Alfred was demonstrating a steam engine and it drenched Bertie's face with water. On another, Princess Helena discovered how scared she was of wasps.' A new children's exhibition on life as a Royal child, which forms part of the conservation project, is based on numerous letters by the children which they wrote while staying in the cottage. The Childhood at Osborne exhibition also draws on Queen Victoria's detailed daily journals, stored in the Royal archives at Windsor Castle. Today the Earl and Countess followed in the footsteps of their ancestors by meeting staff, historians and fundraisers at the cottage and main home on the sprawling 342-acre estate. Mr Hann said: 'They were very engaged with the whole exhibition and were asking lots of questions. It's their family history, after all.' Grand: The Royals were shown round the main house on the Isle of Wight, which was gifted to the public by Edward VII in 1902 when he decided he didn't want it . Just your usual family album: The Royal couple examined some of the documents and artefacts at the home, which is hosting an exhibition on the life of a Royal child . Lavish: After pushing away the children to stay in the Swiss chalet, Victoria and Albert would be free to enjoy the sprawling house on the estate, pictured . The estate was gifted to the nation by Edward VII on his coronation day in 1902 when he decided he didn't want it, and was later used to house a Naval college before being opened fully to the public. But Victoria and Albert's most private rooms were sealed for more than 50 years on the orders of Edward VII, only being unlocked with the permission of Elizabeth II in 1954. Queen Victoria bought the estate in 1845 claiming it was 'impossible to imagine a prettier spot', and her new husband had a new house designed by London's Master Builder of the age Thomas Cubitt. She would spend days on end looking across the Solent to Portsmouth from her private beach, which was where she swam for the first time. Despite the privacy of the huge estate, the famously conservative monarch used a curious 'bathing machine' which concealed her entirely behind a set of curtains while she swam in the sea. Family home: Filled with gold leaf, marble, chandeliers and valuable rugs, the house still contains many of the features which it had during the reign of Queen Victoria . It's like one I have at home! Not all country houses have full-size marble statues inside as well as out, but Osborne was home to Victoria for several months a year . The contraption, containing a plumbed toilet and a changing room, was run to the shore along the beach on a long ramp, and pulled back in using a wire rope and winch. When the queen had finished changing and got into the water, a veranda on the machine would have curtains drawn across it so those on the shore could not see her. She wrote in her journal on 30 July 1847:  'Drove to the beach with my maids and went in the bathing machine, where I undressed and bathed in the sea (for the 1st time in my life). 'I thought it delightful till I put my head under water, when I thought I should be stifled.'","Long-reigning monarch spent up to five months a year at Osborne House, a 342-acre estate on the Isle of Wight .

"By . Fiona Macrae . The study of Roe deer fawns in France found that more young are dying than in the past due to earlier springs . Roe deer fawns are struggling to survive earlier springs, scientists have warned. A study of the forest-loving deer in the Champagne region of France found that more young are dying than in the past. This is blamed on the animals still giving birth at the same time, despite temperatures rising and spring starting two weeks earlier than a quarter of a century ago. An early spring birth allows the mothers to feast on the young shoots and leaves needed to make her milk nutritious. Some other birds and animals have been shown to keep up with the changing climate because their breeding is triggered by temperature. In contrast, it is thought the roe deerâ€™s complex reproductive pattern, in which pregnancy is put on pause for several months after the rut, is dependent on day length. The roe deer is Britainâ€™s most widespread deer species and the researchers, from UniversitÃ© Lyon 1, said it is likely fawns are also struggling to survive here. In contrast red deer are adapting to earlier springs, with a long-term UK study showing the females are giving birth earlier and earlier. Red deer also build-up body reserves ahead of giving birth and tend to only have fawn at a time, while roe deer routinely give birth to twins, the journal PLoS Biology reports.","Study of roe deer fawns in France found more young are dying than before .

"By . Kate Gray . I’ve always loved an adventure, be it back-packing around Iceland when I was six, exploring the Valley of the Kings, or walking through rainforest to reach Mayan temples. Exploring the world and experiencing new things makes me feel alive. Space would be the ultimate adventure - a chance to look back on our fragile planet and be part of the next phase of explorers. Many children dream of being astronauts, but the reality of space seems so far away. They get written off as dreamers, but what’s wrong with aiming for the stars? Dream: Kate poses in front of one of the NASA space shuttles during a visit to the USA . Hero: Kate gets to know Buzz Aldrin, the second person ever to set foot on the moon . You might think that I’m crazy for trying to get to space, but if I make it a reality I’m really excited about sharing the adventure with others. If you’d told me three years ago that I would see shuttles launch, meet rocket scientists and have a friend in space I would thought you were crazy, but all those things have happened – so why not space? Hopefully my enthusiasm will encourage more people to dream. Space is starting to open up to more people. Companies such as Virgin Galactic and XCOR offering tourist flights are just the start. Astronauts I’ve spoken to are keen that more people should share their unique view of the planet. They are using social media to share their time in space, and current International Space Station Commander Chris Hadfield has sent down a plethora of awe-inspiring images from on high. The space sector has come a long way from its beginnings where only macho male military pilots had the chance to be astronauts, so it’s such a shame that Lynx campaign has seemingly ignored this progress. Is the ad sexist? According to Kate, the galactic Lynx campaign most certainly is . Ready for lift off! Despite the sexism, Kate is still entering the contest and hopes to see Earth from above . Their adverts, encouraging people to apply for the Lynx Space Academy, portray women as poor helpless girls that have to be rescued by hunky firemen or lifeguards - not even polite enough to thank their rescuers before ditching them for a male astronaut. The campaign slogan 'Leave a man, return a hero' begs the question 'which man shall I leave?'. 'But the product is aimed at men' I hear you cry. Well I’m not stupid. I know that it’s a male brand. I know that Lynx adverts have always used sex to sell their products. It’s not that that I take issue with. It’s the fact that the adverts promote outdated stereotype that space is just for men, so much so that several in several countries Axe/Lynx refused to allow female entrants to the competition when it began. Research has shown that enduring cultural stereotypes about women’s abilities in scientific fields have real-world effects on their success in the lab. This international, multimillion pound campaign reinforces those stereotypes and may put off the next generation of female scientists. I think it’s really damaging and I want to highlight the fact that there are many amazing women who also work in space. If I won a chance to go to space I would not be able to contain my excitement and nor would I want to. Space is exciting. Space is dangerous, and amazing, and flashy, and sexy. Plan B: If Lynx doesn't work out, Kate hopes to go into space with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic . We need to encourage more people to study science and engineering and remember what it was about space that made us dream of being astronauts when we were younger. Too often scientists are caricatured as boffins, geeks and nerds, but at the heart of it is a desire to explore and understand. To be excited by the world around us. I would love to be able to share the experience and excitement with others and perhaps make Lynx think about the way they portray women in the future. NASA has worked hard to encourage more women into science and engineering. A good friend of mine who got a long way through NASA’s astronaut selection process (for which I sadly lack the US citizenship), sums up the importance of this work: 'It is precisely because NASA has worked so hard to distance itself from its overly masculine past that I felt I had a chance in the first place.' She continues 'I fear Axe/Lynx’s Apollo campaign tarnishes the image of all human spaceflight endeavours, not just their own, and therefore may ultimately discourage young women from imagining they might one day become an astronaut'. That is exactly the sort of thing that I’m fighting against, and if I can get somewhere in this male-oriented competition, maybe that will help others dare to dream.

After 18 months of intensive training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Russia's 'Star City', Sharman was blasted into space on the Soyuz TM-12 mission in 1991. Just 27 years old, she was the fifth youngest person ever to blast into space. Fellow travellers included the Soviet cosmonauts Anatoly Artsebarsky and Sergei Krikalev, and most of the eight day trip was spent on the Russian space station, Mir.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Traumatised: Roy, a 26-year-old Congo African Grey, pecked off all his feathers during three years in captivity . A parrot has been put on anti-depressants to recover from a state of manic trauma after being trapped in a garage for three years. Roy was locked in a dog cage with little food or water as he kept screaming the name of his owner's dead wife over and over again - after the widower's new partner had moved in. In captivity, with little food or water, the Congo African Grey was driven to near-insanity, pecking off all his feathers. The 26-year-old bird is now being treated by Britain's only parrot psychologist Elaine Henley, who has started him on an intensive programme of pills. Ms Henley, who provides respite for pets taken in by Parrot Rescue UK, saved Roy from imprisonment in the home in southern England. In more than 10 years treating birds as far away as Australia and America, Roy is the most disturbed pet she has encountered. Ms Henley, 44, said: 'Heâ€™s so traumatised from his years in the garage which he will never get over.' Roy had been close to his owner Sarah before she died - and would not stop calling for her when she passed away. But Sarah's widower eventually met somebody else, and decided to lock Roy away until they moved house three years later. When they contacted Parrot Rescue UK to give him away, the in-house vets were shocked by his state. Ms Henley said: 'After being left alone for all that time, Roy's new owners decided to give him up as they were moving house and didn't want to take him with them. 'They called the charity and said ""you need to come get this bird, we're off"" and put him out on the doorstep and shut the door.

'He was brought up to me because the charity said I was the only one who would be able to help such a traumatised bird.' In . a desperate bid to nurse him back to health, Ms Henley is lacing Roy's . food with amitriptyline - a powerful anti-depressant similar to Prozac. He is given 0.1ml of the drug a day. 'Before a vet prescribes the drug, though, theyâ€™ll explore all other possible options that can be used to try stop their stress and troublesome behaviour,' she said. Glasgow-based Ms Henley has even taken Roy in as her own. After just a few weeks, he is already picking up her strong Scottish accent - shared by her existing pet parrot Milo. She said: 'They're much smarter than people think.'","Roy, a Congo African Grey, kept screaming name of owner's dead wife .

Organisations including the Nursing and . Midwifery Council (NMC) and the General Medical Council (GMC) are currently bound . by different rules on what they can do. Doctors and nurses face being struck off or disciplined if they cannot speak clearly in English, under new regulations announced today . But the new bill will unite the nine bodies currently covering healthcare, allowing them to work from the same legislative framework. The powers would also allow regulators to proactively investigate instances of suspected poor conduct and practice whenever they come to their attention. whereas currently some can only investigate once they have received a formal complaint. For the first time the sanctions regulators can impose will be extended and they will be able to discipline or strike off professionals who are not able to communicate clearly in English. The Bill also allows regulators to reconsider cases that have been closed following a mistake or error, as recommended by the inquiry into the scandal at Mid Staffs. A process of revalidation - where professionals undergo 'MOTs' to ensure they are still fit to practise - will be extended from doctors to all health and social care professionals. Schemes could also be introduced to bar unregulated workers from providing services, according to the UK-wide recommendations. The nine organisations, including the . General Dental Council, General Pharmaceutical Council and Health . Professions Council, are responsible for around 1.4 million workers . across 32 health and social care roles. Nicholas Paines QC, the commissioner leading the project for England and Wales, said: 'The professional regulators of the health and social care field operate within a wide variety of legal frameworks that have been agreed and amended by Parliament in different ways, at different times, over the past 150 years. The new bill will unite the nine bodies currently covering healthcare . 'Our recommended reforms place patient protection firmly at the heart of a new legal framework. 'If implemented, they will enhance the autonomy of the regulators, empower them to respond more quickly and effectively to emerging public health concerns and enable them to meet the demands of a modern, devolved health and social care sector.' A joint letter signed by the regulators calls on the Government to support the new plans and asks for 'urgent parliamentary consideration' of the Bill. It said: 'The Law Commission was tasked with creating a single, streamlined legal structure covering all nine regulators which would enable us to provide better protection for patients, be more responsive, reduce the burden of regulation and to drive down costs. 'We were, and remain, committed to these aims. Realising them is essential if we are to retain the trust and confidence of the public, healthcare professionals and the health service in which those professionals work. 'The recommendations of Robert Francis QC following events in Mid Staffordshire highlighted the vital importance of effective regulation focused on promoting safe, compassionate patient care rather than, as too often in the past, intervening only after patients have suffered harm.'","Rules set to be published in a new draft bill by the Law Commission .

The 41-year-old, who has just taken over the anchor role following the prompt departure of Josh Elliott last week, has just completed the sixth of eight treatments to battle breast cancer. She underwent the treatment last week and was back at work the next day. Fighter: Amy Robach, pictured left with fellow GMA anchor Lara Spencer, is turning to work to distract her from her chemotherapy treatments following her breast cancer diagnosis last year . 'Amy considers getting up every morning . and having something to look forward to a gift,' a source told People magazine. 'It's a much needed . distraction from her treatment.' Robach, a mother to two young girls and a step-mother to three boys, was diagnosed with breast cancer five months ago after undergoing a mammogram for the show. She discovered she had a . malignant tumor in her right breast and it was only after she had a double mastectomy soon after that . doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some . abnormal cells in the left breast. After . the surgery it also became clear that the disease had spread to her . sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that the mastectomy was far from the final . step. Shock: She was diagnosed with cancer after undergoing an on-air mammogram last October . But amid the treatments, she has stayed positive by focusing on her work. 'Feeling like I have a purpose is very . helpful,' she told the magazine. 'Mentally I feel stronger, knowing I'm still me. I . still have my job. My life isn't just cancer, so it's very important for . me to try and get my butt up.' She returned to the air in December and after cutting her hair short on air, she went to Sochi to cover the Olympics while also undergoing chemo. She told the magazine that she takes naps to keep up but that it can sometimes takes several days 'to get my mojo back'. Preparation: She was filmed chopping off her locks as she started undergoing chemotherapy . Strong: Robach, showing off her new hair, has barely missed a day from work, sources have said . Her final chemo treatment is planned for April 24 and she will have breast reconstruction later this spring. Due to the location and size of the tumors, Robach's surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that are placed where the removed breasts once were. They will stay in place behind the chest muscle for a few months in an effort to stretch it out before implants are put in during a second surgery.","GMA news anchor, 41, was diagnosed with breast cancer last October after undergoing a routine mammogram on air .

"By . James Rush . A black performing arts high school student falsely arrested by three white officers has been awarded $119,000 in damages. Pittsburgh officers David Sisak, Michael Saldutte and Richard Ewing had also been accused of beating 22-year-old Jordan Miles, but a jury found they did not use excessive force. The split verdict by the all-white jury of four men and four women had attorneys for Miles and the officers claiming victory, with neither side completely satisfied. Scroll down for video . Jordan Miles, pictured aged 18, has been awarded $119,000 in damages after a jury found three white officers had falsely arrested him . The jurors awarded Miles $101,016.75 in compensatory damages and $6,000 from each officer for punitive damages for acting 'maliciously and wantonly'. Miles' attorney, Joel Sansone, said he was gratified but did not understand how the jurors decided on the damages or concluded police were wrong to arrest Miles but not to beat him. 'The only thing he wanted to hear was that these officers did the wrong thing,' Sansone said of Miles, 'and he heard that in the courtroom today.' Robert Leight, the attorney for Ewing - who has since left the city police force to work in the suburbs - said the verdict 'makes no sense.' Jurors leaving the courthouse declined to comment, leaving unclear how they viewed the conflicting accounts of what happened on the night of the incident. Miles had claimed the officers confronted him on the night of January 12, 2010, while he was walking to his grandmother's house to spend the night. He said he was talking on his mobile phone when the plainclothes officers pulled up in an unmarked car asking for money, drugs and a gun without identifying themselves. Miles's lawyers argued the 'jump out' tactic, which police denied using, is designed to catch suspected drug dealers off-guard. The officers maintain they flashed their badges and yelled 'Police!' and stopped Miles only because he appeared to be lurking near a neighbour's home. They claim Miles panicked and ran after being asked why he was 'sneaking around'. They say the confrontation escalated when Miles elbowed Saldutte in the head and kicked Sisak in the knee. The officers say they then mistook a 'bulge' in Miles' coat pocket for a gun. The officers acknowledge kneeing and punching Miles to subdue him before determining the bulge was a bottle of Mountain Dew. Miles denies even carrying the bottle, which officers said they threw away because it was not evidence of the prowling, assault and resisting arrest charges they filed against Miles. A city magistrate did not find the police version credible and dismissed those charges weeks later. Sisak's attorney, James Wymard, believes that is why the jury found the officers wrongly arrested Miles. 'Clearly this is a compromise verdict,' Wymard said. 'All along the excessive force is what we were worried about.' Miles' attorney wants the FBI and Justice Department to reconsider a decision not to prosecute the officers criminally. U.S. Attorney David Hickton did not immediately comment. But Leight said the verdict proves the Justice Department was right not to prosecute the officers â€” especially because the burden of proof in a criminal case is even higher than in Miles' lawsuit. Meanwhile, Wymard and Saldutte's attorney, Brian Campbell, said the monetary damages are not a clear victory for Miles. Miles' attorneys previously demanded $2 million to settle the case and rejected the city's offer of $180,000. The city, instead, paid $75,000 to settle Miles' claims against the government itself, with the understanding that money would be deducted from any damages award against the officers. Because more than $41,000 of the verdict was covered by city insurance, the city's $75,000 could be deducted from the remaining $78,000 â€” leaving Miles with a net award of $3,000, Wymard and Campbell said. And Miles could still wind up paying some of the officers' attorneys' fees because he did not win the case outright. Sansone said he was still researching those claims and could not immediately comment, but Wymard said,'Eventually, Miles may well be writing the City of Pittsburgh a check in this case.'","Jordan Miles said he was confronted while walking to grandmother's house .

"By . Louise Boyle . The mother of a young man who died suddenly while backpacking through South-East Asia told MailOnline today that although his family will never know what caused his death, they can take comfort in the incredible life he had and how many people's lives he touched. James Hart, 29, from Mantua, New Jersey, died . on March 30 after collapsing in a Cambodian street following several days of illness on his five-month trip. His mom Donna Holmes Hart spoke on Wednesday about her 'full of life, clever son' who was a 'rock' to his younger siblings, made friends everywhere he went and spent days getting lost in bookstores. She said: 'Jimmy looked at life in a special way, he believed that you have to live for every minute. He lived a short life but it was a wonderful one.' James Hart, who was traveling through South-East Asia died suddenly on March 30 after feeling ill for several days. He posted this picture in late January as he began his five-month trip in Thailand . James Hart, 29, from Mantua, New Jersey, died suddenly on March 30 while traveling in Cambodia. He posted this picture on his blog in February after realizing one of his dreams of seeing the tigers in Thailand . Mr Hart had left the U.S. in January with his friend Derek Miller. The pair traveled around Thailand and Laos, before recently riding motorbikes from Vietnam into Cambodia, where they stayed on an isolated island without electricity. Last . week, the two friends began suffering from headaches, diarrhea and . vomiting, forcing them to attend a tourists' clinic for basic treatment. A short time later, Mr Hart collapsed in the street and despite resting, passed out again a short time later. Mr Miller rushed his friend to hospital but Mr Hart was pronounced dead on Sunday. His mother said: 'Jimmy sent me an email the day before he died saying that he had been really sick for two days. He didn't complain - instead he said he had saved $50 for traveling because he wasn't able to eat. 'He said that he was feeling better but Derek told us that he had been feeling light-headed, very weak.' Donna Hart said that her son . was in great health and had never been in hospital. He loved going to . the gym every day, eating well and hiking. Before . he left on his trip, Mr Hart and his mom, who works in healthcare, researched diseases that are specific to the region along with rates of infection. James Hart and his friend Derek Miller (pictured on March 22) both fell ill while traveling through South-East Asia. Mr Hart, who was in great health and had taken precautions against tropical diseases, died a few days later . Mr Hart had also visited a specialist travel doctor in Philadelphia for immunizations and was fully prepared, carrying prophylactics and antibiotics in his backpack. Mr . Hart's cause of death is unknown and will remain so after his body was . cremated due to a lack of proper refrigeration at the morgue in the . region. Cambodian authorities declared his . cause of death as cardiac arrest. Donna Hart said today that despite the fact she will never know how or why her son died - one person mentioned an aneurysm, another told her it could have been a bacterial infection - it will not change the fact he is gone. She said: 'In the moments before he died, I was told he came to, slapped someone on the arm, and said ''I'm going to be OK.'' 'Knowing how he died won't change anything. He was so happy when he was traveling. He inspired so many other people.' She added: 'We were very close and I pushed him to follow whatever he wanted to do. I told him ''I'm behind you 100 per cent.''' James' younger brother Donnie Hart, who was the first to find out about his brother's death, told MailOnline today that he was struggling to come to terms with the devastating news. The 26-year-old said: 'The hardest part is not knowing. It's not like he was hit by a car here in the U.S. We don't know what happened.' James Hart, who attended Widener and Arizona State Universities, had also . attended the Los Angeles Academy of Performing Arts and had dreams of . becoming a film producer, his brother said. The 29-year-old worked for Apple in California in his mid-twenties and later . returned to work for the company in Philadelphia. However the 9-5 life . was not for him and he decided to leave the rat race behind in favor of seeing the . world. Donnie Hart, who is a professional wrestler, said his brother believed there was 'more to life' than fancy clothes and flashy cars. James had saved up, sold his belongings and started to travel - much like his idol Jack Kerouac. James Hart, pictured left, around Christmas time with his brother Donnie and sister Brooke . In 2012, the two brothers embarked on a road trip across the U.S. that was inspired by James'love of Kerouac's classic On The Road, Donnie said. James had a quote from the Beat novel, 'mad to live', tattooed on his upper arm in Venice Beach, California, before the pair set off on their drive across country. Donnie Hart said: 'He was the first person I called to ask advice. He was always the smart, wise one.' The brothers also both had the same word 'ditto' as a tattoo - a reminder of what they would say to their mom when she told them she loved them. James had his inked across his heart. James . Hart's mother Donna has received messages of condolence from her son's . friends across the world, many of whom he had met on his travels. Ms Hart said that a young woman whom her son had stayed with in Madrid had gotten in touch to share how James had taken her a park in her home city that she never knew existed. Another friend from France, whose apartment Mr Hart had 'couch-surfed' at, described him running across a highway to capture a picture of a sunset. Ms Hart said: 'Someone who Jimmy met on a plane for a few hours when he was flying to Iceland sent me a message saying that he had inspired her to travel. 'I want to be sad but I can't because all these people are reaching out to me, even people he had just spent a few moments with, telling me how he affected their lives.' She added: 'I expected this from his friends but these are only people who had known him for a day or a few hours. I knew him, but I didn't know about all of this.' James Hart first headed to Europe in 2013 and walked the Way of St James, a historic route of pilgrims through Spain. James Hart posted this picture on March 19, relaxing on a beach on a Cambodian Island . Donna Hart said: 'He was so impressed . that he stayed another two weeks to attend Mass in Santiago de . Compostela. He had a wonderful time, he just loved talking to people. 'The walk gave him a different way of looking at people and he was humbled by those he had met.' His mom said that she was surprised by his plan to travel to Asia but supported what he wanted to do. She said: 'Jimmy wanted to see the tigers, the elephants and every temple and every church.' She remembered how the night before his trip he had stayed up late watching the movie of On The Road. 'He always had something, a look in his eyes that said ''let's go,''' she said of her son. Mr Hart posted dozens of photos on social media of his South-East Asia trip which he embarked on in January with a close friend . Mr Hart's social media accounts and blog, If I Were Going are testament to the 29-year-old's love of travel. They are filled with pictures of pristine beaches, treks . through the jungle, a visit to a tiger sanctuary and hanging out with fellow travelers at moonlit . parties. James Hart is survived by his parents Donna and James Hart Snr, his brother Donnie and 28-year-old sister Brooke. Funeral . arrangements have been scheduled for April 12 in Mantua, New Jersey. Hundreds of people are expected to attend including Mr Hart's friends from as far afield as Spain and Italy. Mr . Hart's ashes are being brought home from Cambodia by his friend Derek Miller. A fundraising page, Mad To Live RIP James Hart, has been set up to bring home Mr Hart's ashes. It has raised close to $15,000 in one day. The 29-year-old posted dozens of pictures of his adventures across the world before his untimely death. He posted this one last month while swimming with friends in Cambodia .","James Hart, from Mantua, New Jersey, died on March 30 after collapsing on a Cambodian street following several days of illness .

"By . John Hall . It was the car the defined the 1980s - and now fans of TV programme Knight Rider have their chance to own their own version of the black Pontiac Firebird that stole the show from star David Hasselhoff. Although the replica is not one of the many cars that originally appeared in the show, it does come from Hasselhoff's personal collection after being given to the actor by its designer Jennifer Catano. The completely road-legal car - which like its on-screen lookalike has been named KITT - is now up for sale for $15,000 through the California-based Julien's Auctions, with a current bid of $16,000 and a final sale estimate of $30,000 to $50,000. Scroll down for video . Design: This replica version of KITT from Knight Rider is completely road-legal and can now be purchased by fans of the TV show for an estimated $30,000 to $50,000 . Gift: Although the replica is not one of the four cars that originally appeared in the show, it does come from Hasselhoff's personal collection after being given to the actor by its designer Jennifer Catano . Detailed: The replica KITT even has a W-shaped steering wheel and vast quantities of flickering red and yellow LEDs for that added touch of authenticity . To give the replica KITT that added touch of authenticity, Catano installed Lamborghini-style scissor doors, a W-shaped steering wheel and vast quantities of flickering red and yellow LEDs on both the interior and the exterior. She even went as far as to load the V8 Firebird with more than 4,000 sound samples from the original TV show, which ensures KITT's famous 'personality' can be recalled at the touch of a button. Catano presented the car to Hasselhoff in 2012 as a gift on his 60th birthday, with the vehicle subsequently taken on a Europe-wide tour. It is currently on display at . Newbridge Silverwares' Museum of Style Icons in County Kildare, Ireland . until April 27, which means the new owner is unlikely to receive the . vehicle until early next month. The replica KITT is just one of many items Hasselhoff is currently selling through Julien's . Auctions - with the rest of the collection including a life sized model . of the actor wearing his famous red Baywatch swimming trunks, a . Baywatch-themed pinball machine, and a Knight Rider golf buggy. Travelling around: Jennifer Catano presented the car to David Hasselhoff as a gift on his 60th birthday. The vehicle has recently been on a Europe-wide tour . Hit: The original version of KITT was so popular that it regularly stole the Knight Rider television show from star David Hasselhoff in the 1980s . Drive: The Pontiac Firebird used in Knight Rider is a 'third generation' model (pictured) made for 10 years between 1982 and 1992 . All of the items are expected to sell for tens of thousands of dollars. If . KITT fans are unable to match the final asking price at the auction, . Catano has offered to build as many versions of the iconic car as are . ordered. She said the . estimated cost of any future build would be anywhere between $30,000 and . $50,000 depending on the specifications required. The Pontiac Firebird used in Knight Rider is a 'third generation' model made for 10 years between 1982 and 1992. The car was available as a two-door coupe or as a convertible, with an engine size ranging from a standard 2.5 litre capacity, to a massive 5.7 litre Chevrolet V-8. The car had a top speed of 162mph and would travel from 0 to 60mph in about seconds, depending on the engine models. Even before Knight Rider first aired in 1982, it was obvious KITT would be the real star of the show. Writer and producer Glen A. Larson said his intention was to 'do The Lone Ranger with a car', with KITT right at the heart of all the action. The KITTs used in the show were Pontiac Firebird Trans Ams that David Hasselhoff's character Michael Knight had heavily modified - costing the show a staggering $100,000 to build. Authentic: She even went as far as to load the car with more than 4,000 sound samples from the original TV show (pictured), which ensures KITT's famous 'personality' can be recalled at the touch of a button . KITT actually stands for Knight Industries Two Thousand, although in pre-production the name used was TATT - Trans Am Two Thousand. The stunt work involved in the show led to between four and nine cars being ruined each season, but the cost dramatically reduced as time went on. Pontiac started selling Knight Rider the basic black vehicles for a nominal $1 each, with the cusomisation of each one costing about $18,000. The show even kept two versions of the car just for use in jump scenes. These vehicles had extra light bodies and higher-quality shock absorbers to make flying through the air and landing easier.","A road-legal version of KITT from Knight Rider has gone up for sale .

Michael Strahan has confirmed that he has been in talks with Good Morning America about joining the morning show team in addition to his co-hosting role on 'Live with Kelly and Michael'. The former football star-turned-chat show host reiterated that he will keep the 9am talk show as his priority even though he is going to be brought into the GMA fold after the sudden departure of Josh Elliott. 'This is what I do. This is me. This is my home. I love you,' he said on 'Live' to Kelly Ripa. Scroll down for video . New prospects: Michael Strahan confirmed on Wednesday that he has been in talks with executives at Good Morning America about joining the program in addition to his work on 'Live with Kelly and Michael' What's to come: Strahan said that they had not yet figured out the details but reassured fans that the 9am talk show and Ripa were his 'number one' priorities . 'So no matter what I go nowhere. This is my love. You are my love. This is my job so don't worry.' Strahan said that he had gone for meetings with GMA executives but they had not yet finalized how he would juggle his work on the two shows- both of which air on ABC and are Disney productions. Strahan, who played for the New York Giants for 15 years, already pulls double duty during football season as he works as a commentator for Fox NFL Sunday. He said that whatever they work out with GMA, they will have to be 'smart about it' when it comes to his schedule. 'This is my number one priority, you are my number one priority and I love what I do. I would never do anything to jeopardize the quality of what we do,' he said on 'Live'. Coinicidence?

The Royal family are understood to be benefiting from a leasing arrangement by German car manufacturer Audi which could offer them up to a 60 per cent discount on their cars. As valued customers, the Royals are able to take advantage of the company's VIP terms and conditions - meaning their cars are also personally delivered. Such favourable leasing arrangements are not available to ordinary motorists and shows why the Royals have favoured the manufacturer over the last decade. The Prince of Wales owns several models, including an A8 limousine that cost £92,500 and a pair of Allroad estate for personal use by himself and the Duchess of Cornwall. He has also purchased two A4's for his staff. Prince William drives a S4 saloon which has a 4.2 litre engine while the Duchess of Cambridge owns a silver A3 model. The couple now also have a £250,000 Bentley for high-profile official engagements. In his first public visit to his prospective in-laws in 2009, William chose a black Audi for the journey to their home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, from his father’s Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire. The deal with the company may also explain why its head of PR Jon Zamett was invited to the couple's wedding. The manufacturer is understood to be investing thousands of pounds in boosting its image - and getting close to the Royals. They have made large donations to charities that are supported by the Princes and signed an agreement in 2005 to sponsor the English polo squad. Marketing experts say that offering their cars at competitive rates could offer unique prestige. Ian Stephens, of Saffron Brand Consultants, told the Times: 'Giving away cars is a bit sensitive.If you rent them at a discount you get around concerns over bribery or corruptions and still gain the association.' 'Audi are competing against other German and luxury brands that are established in the UK market, and they've always been outsiders. They are trying to buy their way into the establishment.'","The Audi 5S5 starts from £59,350 - the Royal family are understood to benefit from leasing arrangement .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Close call: Richard Cohen, seen right with wife Meredith Vieira in 2012, was rushed to the hospital this weekend to treat a blood clot . Meredith Vieira's husband Richard Cohen had a health scare this weekend that left them both waiting in the emergency room for news on his life-and-death condition. Cohen's long battle with multiple sclerosis has been well documented but the sudden hospital trip this weekend was the result of a blood clot that traveled from his leg up dangerously close to his heart. 'It was sudden and serious. Very serious,' the former news producer turned author wrote on his blog, Journey Man. 'A badly swollen foot and a series of tests at a local hospital revealed a sizable blood clot in a leg. A CT scan indicated a piece of the clot had broken off and reached my lungs, perched on a blood vessel close to my heart.' Cohen is currently undergoing stem cell treatment that is connected to his chronic illness but he was quick to point out that the blood clot was not connected to that treatment. 'It probably was caused by too many hours sitting in one position at the computer. The trial goes on and my determination to get over this goes on with it,' Cohen wrote. Doctors used blood thinners and inserted an 'umbrella' tool that helped to catch future clots. 'The crisis seemed to end, and a new phase had begun.  Thereâ€™s a lot to figure out for the future,' he wrote. The 66-year-old journalist has battled MS for more than four decades and had two bouts of colon cancer. He worked for CNN, CBS, and ABC as a senior producer earlier in his career and he has continued writing. He has written three books and occasionally writes articles for The New York Times' health and fitness section as well as keeping an active blog that details his medical treatment. Warning signs: Late last week, Cohen started noting that he did not feel well . Support: Vieira, who used to be one of the Today Show anchors and the host of Who Wants to be a Millionaire, is returning to TV in the fall with the launch of her own afternoon talk show . Happy ending: Vieira updated her followers but remained positive .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . How many people will be willing to say 'I volunteer' to being dropped in the wilderness and forced to fend for themselves while being watched on camera 24/7? That's the premise around Survival Live, a Hunger Games-like new reality adventure series being produced by Discovery. Set to premiere later this year, the show will strand eight contestants in a jungle-like environment for 42 days and force them to fend for themselves, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The program will air two episodes each week - one pre-recorded and one live - and viewers will be able to track the survivalist's progress on a 24/7 web platform. Gamers ready: Survival Live, a new adventure series being made by Discovery, sounds like a reality spin-off of The Hunger Games, starring Jennifer Lawrence (pictured). The show will strand eight people in the wilderness and film them 24/7 as they fend for themselves . Similar: Discovery also produce the series Naked and Afraid, in which one male and one female contestant are dropped in the jungle with no food, no water and no clothes . Like Big Brother - and in a new twist on the traditional format - contestants will be able to ask viewers for help. Each person will have to build their own social network to help them through their ordeal by talking to the cameras in a video diary-like scenario, and their relationship with the audience will decide whether they stay or go. The survivalist who proves the weakest will be eliminated during the live episode each week. The show will be filmed somewhere in the Pacific Rim. 'It's a really fascinating opportunity to take one of our strongest genres, survival, and mash it up with a live environment, but also do it in a very social and digital way,' Eileen O'Neill, group president of Discovery and TLC Networks, told THR. The network already has mounted live versions of multiple series, such as American Chopper. O'Neill has made big-scale live stunts a priority at Discovery because they equal big ratings. Austrian jumper Felix Baumgartner's leap from the stratosphere gave the network a record daytime audience of more than 4.2 million viewers, while Nik Wallenda's high-wire walk over the Grand Canyon was watched by more than 13 million viewers last summer. According to Eileen O'Neill, group president of Discovery and TLC Networks, Survival Live will be filmed at an isolated location somewhere in the Pacific Rim and will premiere later this year . In May Discovery will present Everest Jump Live, during which free jumper Joby Ogwyn will climb Mount Everest and then leap from the summit in a custom-made wing-suit. The success of unscripted adventure shows including Survivor, Amazing Race and Discovery's Naked and Afraid, in which one male and one female contestant are dropped in the jungle with no food, no water and no clothes. But O'Neill notes that only experienced survivalists need apply for Survival Live. 'We have a lot of people who want to test their mettle on our survival shows,' she said. 'These are pretty rugged environments, so we do background checks and psych checks, and that reduces the pool to choose from pretty quickly.'","Survival Live will premiere later this year on Discovery .

"By . James  Nye . Kim Kardashian has waded into the controversial and ethically murky Syrian civil war - issuing a call to her 20 million followers on Twitter to save the ancient Armenian Christian village of Kessab, which was taken over by rebels last month. However, despite her well-intentioned tweet, the reality television star has been criticized for using the hashtag #SaveKessab - which some have accused of being part of a stealth social media campaign backing Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The hashtag has been linked with false claims made by loyalists to Assad, who have said that Syrian rebels desecrated the village's churches and slaughtered its residents. Political statement: Kim Kardashian has tweeted her support for the embattled Christian Armenians of Kessab in Syria - causing some controversy . Indeed, horrifying images linked to Save Kessab that show a young girl mutilated with a crucifix and a decapitated little girl have been comprehensively debunked - with critics branding them pro-Assad propaganda. 'If you don't know what's going on in Kessab please google it ... As an Armenian, I grew up hearing so many painful stories,' Kim wrote in a March 30 tweet. 'Please let's not let history repeat itself!!!!!! Let's get this trending!!!! #SaveKessa #ArmenianGenocide,' she wrote. In doing so, Kim, whose father was of Armenian descent, underscored how Syria's war, more than any other in history, has been waged on social media, with both supporters of President Bashar Assad and those opposing his rule using selectively chosen videos and photos, sometimes faked, recycled or altered, to support their grievances. Concern: Kim tweeted this on Sunday March 30 - as she sought to draw attention to the danger facing Armenians in Kessab and the horror of the genocide inflicted on her compatriots in the early part of the 20th century . History: Kim Kardashian has waded into Syria's conflict, calling on fans through Twitter to save the ancient Armenian Christian village of Kassab, whose residents fled as rebels seized control of the hamlet in late March . Plea: Kardashian's publicist Ina Treciokas said Kardashian was ""just voicing her support for Armenians"" and said she had no additional comment . However, it is obvious that Kim's support for the campaign to save civilians caught up in the brutal fighting in Kessab is far more personal than simple altruism. Kim is Armenian and April is the month . during which her compatriots remember the genocide of an estimate 1.5 . million Armenians by Ottoman forces during World War 1 and its . aftermath. The event is widely viewed by scholars as the first genocide of the 20th century. The Kardashian family are originally from Karakale, a village in East Turkey, close to the Armenian border and populated by ethnic Armenians. Her great-great grandparents on her father's side are Sam and Harom Kardaschoff - the Russian spelling of the Armenian name, Kardashian. They fled along with her great-grandfather during the 'Medz Yeghern' or Great Crime - which was the genocide and expulsion of Armenians from what is now modern-day Turkey. The family made it Los Angeles and Robert Kardashian, Kim's father, was a high-profile lawyer who helped O.J. Simpson's not-guilty verdict in the 1990s. 'I was raised with a huge Armenian influence, always hearing stories of Armenia, celebrating Armenian holidays,' said Kim in the past. 'My father taught us to never forget where we came from.' Father and daughter: Kim Kardashian and her father Robert, whose family are Armenian by descent and who famously helped defend O.J. Simpson against murder charges in the 1990s . Kim's use of the two hashtags side-by-side, '#SaveKessab' and '#ArmenianGenocide' suggested she was linking the flight of most of Kassab's 2,000 residents and those killed by Turkish forces. Kim's tweets are not the first time she has been criticized for political errors. In April 2011, she featured on the cover of Turkish Cosmopolitan - which was controversial when considering the relationship between Armenia and Turkey. Kim was prompted into her tweet by events last week when Syrian rebels moved into the northwestern coastal province of Latakia, which is where the Assad family is from. The rebels allegedly include fighters from  Jabhat al-Nusra - the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda. Critical: Kim has come under pressure to distance herself from #SaveKessab hashtag which some say supports Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad . Anger: Some took to Twitter to chastise Kim for trying to tweet support for civilians in Kessab . Correction: Others tried to not so subtly point out that the images linked to #SaveKessab are fake . Since then, hundreds of Armenian Christians have fled and Kessab has been overrun by rebels. The complicated political situation in Syria's three-year civil war sees the nation's ethnic Armenian population having to back the Assad regime. They see him as their only safety net against radical Islamists who are a large part of Syria's opposition. However, this has not carried much favor with the very influential Armenian diaspora, especially in the United States - of which the Kardashian family are prominent members. Kim's public backing for Save Kessab has been endorsed by the Syrian National Coalition, one of the main opposition groups. 'We are glad Kim Kardashian is taking an interest in this issue, as we too are concerned about extremist groupsâ€™ persecution of minorities,' Khalid Saleh, a spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, told The Daily Beast. Battle: Syrian army's artillery seen firing at  rebel positions from the town of al-Mishrfeh, some four km from the rebel-held Kassab town in the northern countryside of the coastal city of Latakia, on 27 March 2014 . Fight: Syrian soldiers seen in a position in al-Mishrfeh town, some four km from the rebel-held Kassab town in the northern countryside of the coastal city of Latakia, Syria, on 27 March 2014 . 'The Free Syrian Army has put out a statement committed to protecting of citizens of Armenian descent and to maintaining the integrity of their religious sites and protecting them from the Assad's attacks and use of indiscriminate fire, which continue against innocent people.' However, some are plain furious with Kim for using drawing attention to such a controversial issue to her 20 million followers. Kardashian's publicist Ina Treciokas said Kardashian was 'just voicing her support for Armenians' and said she had no additional comment. Her Kessab tweets were followed by a flurry of sultry selfies of her riding on a boat in a skimpy top and long skirt with hashtags like #WishYouWereHere and #WhatALife. She has been posting from Thailand in recent days, including one that shows her sitting at the entry of a temple featuring the Buddha.","Kim Kardashian has issued a plea to protect the Armenian Christian's of Syrian town Kessab .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Three animal shelter employees in southeast Ohio have pleaded not guilty to charges of inhumanely killing dogs. The Gallia County dog warden, his assistant and a former warden are accused of killing dogs by injecting a drug directly into their hearts without using a sedative, which veterinarians say causes extreme pain before death. The misdemeanor animal cruelty charges were filed after necropsies done at Ohio State University's veterinary hospital showed that several of the dogs recovered from the county animal shelter were inhumanely euthanized. Charged: The Gallia County dog warden, Paul Simmer, seen here, could face up to eight years in jail . Alleged cruelty: Former assistant Jason Harris is charged with 12 counts of second-degree misdemeanor animal cruelty . An animal autopsy referred to as a . necropsy, done at The Ohio State University's Veterinary Medical Center . shows several of the 12 dogs recovered from the county animal shelter . were killed by injecting a barbiturate into their heart or nearby . organs. The necropsy also shows one of the dogs sustained blunt force trauma, another trauma to the head. 'The . necropsy showed evidence [that] shows the animals were euthanized by a . method we call heart stick,' said John Bell, the Ohio Society for the . Prevention and Cruelty to Animals' (Ohio SPCA) attorney. Cruel: An animal autopsy referred to as a necropsy showed several of the 12 dogs recovered from the county animal shelter were killed by injecting a barbiturate into their heart or nearby organs(note, these are not the actual dogs) The city solicitor and animal rights groups said shoving a needle into the dog's heart without first using a sedative causes the dogs excruciating pain and suffering some for least a half-hour before their death. 'Devastated that the animals had to go through something like that,' said Diane Amann, a shelter volunteer, to NBC 4. According to the Friends of Gallia County’s Animals, a local rescue group, the dogs had been vaccinated and were in the process of being adopted when the deaths occurred. The euthanizations occurred one day before a planned adoption event. Ohio SPCA’s Executive Director Teresa Landon, the Grove City, Ohio-based animal group has a launched a “full-scale investigation” into the deaths of the 11 dogs . 'We have received information that leads us to believe that the dogs were killed by intra-cardiac injection without sedation,' Landon said. 'If this is true, the dogs suffered a horrifying death.' Intra-cardiac injection, otherwise known as a 'heart stick,' is only legal if a dog has been properly sedated and is unconscious, Landon said. Gallia County Shelter: The alleged abused took place over a period of several years . Standing his ground: Jason Harris who worked at the shelter has pleaded not guilty to all of the abuse charges . Waste of life? The misdemeanor animal cruelty charges were filed after necropsies done at Ohio State University's veterinary hospital showed that several of the dogs recovered from the county animal shelter were inhumanely euthanized . Dog warden Paul Simmer, his assistant, Jason Harris, and former warden Jean Daniels pleaded not guilty to the charges in Gallipolis Municipal Court on Tuesday. They are due back in court next week . Simmers, the county’s dog warden, faces 32 counts of animal cruelty. His former assistant, Harris, faces 12 counts, while Daniels, a former county dog warden, faces 13 counts. Each charge, is punishable by up to 90 days incarceration, a $750 fine, five years’ probation and 200 hours of community service, meaning Simmers could be facing eight years in jail with Harris and Daniels looking at three each. It is alleged that the trio negligently caused unnecessary pain and suffering to dogs being euthanized at the animal shelter. The case came to light shortly after Feb. 14 when the Grove City-based Ohio Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals said it planned to 'fully investigate' the deaths of the 11 dogs.","The Gallia County dog warden, his assistant and a former warden are accused of killing .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tragic: Paul Franklin Dart, pictured right with friends, was trying to calm down the gunman when he was shot in the head . The murder case where a homeowner allegedly shot an Army vet dead after he caught the man's relative urinating on his property has now turned into a legal battle over land rights. James Crocker had grown weary of the partying canoeists and rafters who encroached on his neatly kept property along Missouri's Meramec River. When he caught Paul Dart Jr. as he was about to relieve himself on a gravel bar by his yard last month, a nasty confrontation ensued that ended with one person dead and Crocker accused of killing him. The case against Crocker is the latest to put a spotlight on 'castle doctrine' laws, which allow the use of deadly force to protect property. Missouri is among at least 30 states that have enacted the statutes, which supporters say protect gun rights but others insist promote vigilantism. Prosecutors interpreted the actions differently, as witnesses who testified at a hearing this month said Crocker was angry and raging, shooting into the crowd of people, narrowly missing two others before killing 48-year-old Paul Dart Jr. of Robertsville. Crocker, 59, has been charged with second degree murder. Crocker lives in a small white frame home on a shaded gravel road about eight miles west of Steelville, the self-proclaimed floating capital of the world. Tens of thousands of people come to the region every year to raft, canoe or kayak down the Meramec and nearby rivers. Charged: James Robert Crocker, 59, pictured, confronted the group of family and friends with a 9 mm handgun and shot dead Paul Franklin Dart, 48, after they stopped for a break at a gravel bar in Meramex . Drinking is sometimes part of the outings, resulting in bawdy behavior that doesn't sit well with owners of land that touches the river. Many have complained for years about loud parties, trash left behind and crude behavior. On July 20, Dart, a carpenter, and around four dozen other members of an extended family gathered at a campground for their annual float trip along the Meramec. A few hours into the trip, Robert and Regina Burgess stopped their canoe on a gravel bar. Robert, who had drunk about three beers, decided to relieve himself, he testified at the preliminary hearing. Legal battle: Crocker, seen here at a preliminary hearing in Steeleville on August 16, faces a second degree murder charge . Uninvited guests: Crocker and many other neighbors had apparently complained for the frequent tour groups who regularly drank during their trips down the Meramec River . Crocker confronted Burgess and other members of the party. When happened then is in dispute, and will be a crucial part of the case. Burgess said it was only after Dart was shot that members of the party picked up rocks to defend themselves against Crocker, who was armed with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. 'I'm standing there unarmed and the guy's got a gun,' Burgess said. Crocker didn't testify at the hearing, but his attorney gave a different account. In . an interview with The Associated Press, Crocker's attorney Michael Bert . said Crocker politely asked the float trip party to leave. 'The response he got was angry and profane,' Bert said. Whether . or not the floaters were on Crocker's property may be an issue in the . case since Missouri law isn't clear on where private property along a . waterway begins. Friends: Paul Dart, pictured center with his wife Loretta and niece, left, went on a floating trip every year in the same area . Horror: Paul Dart, pictured, was shot in the head in front of his wife Loretta, pictured left, and died on the way to hospital . Some experts say it starts at the vegetation line; others say property rights extend to the center of a river or stream. Missouri's . castle doctrine statute, enacted in 2007, gives residents a legal right . to defend themselves and their property against intruders. Supporters . of such laws cite a number of cases in which homeowners were able to . fend off burglars or other criminals without fear of prosecution. But . Florida's law gained notoriety after a neighborhood watch activist, . George Zimmerman, fatally shot teen Trayvon Martin, and was acquitted of . criminal charges.","James Robert Crocker, 59, shot Paul Franklin Dart, 48, in the head .

Crocker approached with a handgun and told them to get off his land but the group refused, claiming it was public property .
The argument escalated and Crocker shot Dart as the unarmed man was trying to calm him down .
The laws in Missouri are extremely vague about property rights along streams and rivers and who can legally access them ."
"By . William Turvill . Usain Bolt has caused embarrassment to Virgin Media after being caught performing crude dance moves at a pre-carnival party in Trinidad and Tobago. The Olympic legend, who features in a number of Virgin adverts for broadband, was pictured in Momentum nightclub 'daggering' with a participating female. The controversial dance, which originated in Mr Bolt's native Jamaica, is designed to imitate sexual intercourse. Scroll down for video . Athlete Usain Bolt has been photographed 'daggering' at a pre-carnival party in Trinidad and Tobago . The photographs will be the cause of embarrassment for Virgin Media, the company which Mr Bolt stars in adverts for in the UK . This picture shows Usain Bolt with Sir Richard Branson performing in one of his many adverts for Virgin Media . Often seen during carnivals, the dance is known for its sexually explicit style and is usually performed to dancehall music. The Olympic record holder appeared happy to be photographed as he took part in the dance in front of fans. At the height of six foot and five inches, the Jamaican sprinter towered over the unknown female as they danced together on stage. The athlete, dressed in  a black vest and bright orange shorts, also spoke to fans from the stage. The Olympic legend, who features in a number of television adverts for Virgin, was pictured in Momentum nightclub . The dance, which originated in Mr Bolt's native Jamaica, is designed to imitate sexual intercourse . Mr Bolt is widely believed to be the fastest man in the world, and has set world records in both the 100- and 200-metre races . He has since return to his gruelling . work schedule as he shares a Instagram video with fans captioned: ‘Early . morning Electro Stimulation work out..strengthening of the core..no . pain no gain..the journey must continue #SeriousFace . #ForeverFaster#ElectroStimulation #StillHungry’. Mr Bolt is widely believed to be the fastest man in the world, and has set world records in both the 100- and 200-metre races. He has set three world records in the Olympics and won gold medals in the 100- and 200-metre races at both the 2008 and 2012 Games. Virgin Media declined to comment. Originating from Jamaica, daggering is a controversial dance form designed to imitate sexual intercourse. It is considered more explicit than grinding and can include acrobatic stunts in which one partner jumps on to another from a height. The dance is said to have been performed in Jamaica for a number of years but has only recently become known by the name daggering. There have been efforts in recent years to crack down on daggering in Jamaica, with the nation’s Broadcast Commission banning songs and music videos which show or promote the dance. The rise in popularity of daggering has also been a concern for those in the medical profession. The dance has reportedly resulted in a rise in the number of men fracturing and damaging their penises.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Animal welfare officers and police were forced to wear gas masks as they removed more than 130 cats from the Houston home of 60-year-old twin sisters yesterday. Conditions inside the home were filthy, with piles of rubbish, an overwhelming stench of ammonia, and a decomposing cat in the bathroom. Officers were due to return to the home today to try to dig out several more cats, who have burrowed into 4ft high mounds of feces. Scroll down for video .

Distressing: Overflowing litter trays, piles of paper, and debris cover the sitting room . A spokesperson for the SPCA told Mail Online someone had called to alert them to the hoarding at the home where the sisters, who have not been named, lived. One of the twins is believed to be suffering from cancer, and was taken away by ambulance. The other was seen watching, hand over her mouth, as their cats were loaded into a van. 'There's not one square inch of clean . area in the house,' Harris County police spokesman J.C. Mosier told Houston Chronicle. The retired homicide investigator added: 'I’ve never seen the inside of a house look like this,. Never in my life. And I thought I’d seen a lot of things until I saw this today.' From the outside, the yard was a little overgrown, but there was little sign of the distressing conditions inside.

'They have burrowed into the mounds of feces like a rat would make a tunnel into a hill,' Mosier told KHOU 11. Houston SPCA will be given medical treatment to the cats, before finding them secure homes. 'We’re going to work and make sure they get into loving homes. We’re going to work with our adoption partners or even place them in reputable sanctuaries,' Meera Nandlal, of SPCA, said. No charges are expected to be brought against the women, but Mosier said police were trying to get them help. 'I don’t know that they’ll ever be able to totally recover from what’s happened to their house. But I hope there are people who can help us help these ladies. It’s such a sad situation,' he said. Mosier told Mail Online that Adult Protection Services were working with the sisters to help them find a new place to live. He added that one of them has terminal cancer and that they were able to convince her to go to hospital for a check up. Heavy load: The SPCA removed about 130 cats from the Houston home .

"By . Anna Edwards . Most people would be content with simply mowing their grass and decorating their garden with a gnome. But one neurologist clearly wasn't content with just pruning his garden - and has spent nearly 20 years carving fantastic shapes out of his bushes, including the shape of a skull. Jeremy Gibbs' latest addition to his eye-catching garden is a macabre-looking skull and a giant pair of hands. Hands up if you like topiary! Jeremy Gibbs' home in Welwyn Garden City has giant ivy hands that scale the side of building . Shear brilliance: This huge skull adorns the home of the creative brain specialist - and is a joy to his neighbours . Instead of tangled ivy plants climbing his house, his bushes' 15ft green hands creep up the wall. And forget a friendly row of flowers welcoming visitors up his drive - instead, guests are met with a huge skull. The brain specialist has also adorned his £800,000 home with elaborate topiary including a series of animals holding hands. The 57-year-old medic, who works for East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, has been carving 'brilliant' sculptures in his garden for nearly two decades. His neighbour William Osborne, 65, said: 'I have always thought they are brilliant. 'How nice is it to see something original. It took me a while to realise what they were at first but they are wonderful.' Residents on his street have been stopping to admire a set of menacing 15ft hands carved onto the side of his £800,000 home . The trend for topiary may have died out during the 18th Century - but there are still parts of the world that have kept the artform blooming. Levens Hall, in Cumbria, is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as being the oldest topiary garden in the world. Some of the trees and bushes are three hundred years old and the layout of this garden has changed little since their planting and initial training in the 1690s. The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, is home to a huge West Highland Terrier carved out of flowers, designed by the artist Jeff Koons. Ladew Topiary Gardens in Maryland, America, are home to elaborate topiary scenes - the most famous being a hunt scene complete with riders, horses, dogs and a fox, inspired by owner and 1930s socialite Harvey Ladew, who spent time in England fox-hunting. Another neighbour, Gillian Sainsbury, 75, added: 'People seem to enjoy them and they are quite pretty.' Residents on his street in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, have been stopping to admire the work. The art of topiary was first used by the Egyptians in 4,000BC, when they began to neatly trim their plants into box hedges, the European and Boxwood Topiary Society said. The Romans introduced the design to Europe after many of the box hedges were planted in villas during the reign of Emperor Augustus in 100BC. In the Dark Ages the skill was taken to Europe, where hedges were transformed into different shapes - a popular one being a tiered design now called 'the wedding cake'. During the Tudor period the art form became very popular in Britain, with Henry VIII's Hampton Court Palace decorated with deer, greyhound and boat designs. In the 18th Century, famed landscape architect Lancelot 'Capability' Brown preferred a natural garden, moving the trend away from pruned and deliberate shapes. Dr Gibbs yesterday declined to comment on his spectacular garden.","Brain specialist Jeremy Gibbs has adorned his home with elaborate topiary .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Shocking: Emily Davis was struck by lightning on Monday but miraculously managed to escape with no serious injuries even after watching an 'orb' of lightning travel up her umbrella . A California woman who was struck by lightning in a rare Bay Area electrical storm says she's extremely lucky to be alive. Emily Davis was crossing a Berkeley street Monday around 1pm when she had an overpowering metal taste in her mouth and then saw the electricity moving along her metal umbrella. Davis managed to make it out of the storm uninjured, but even hours later when her boyfriend gave her a relieved kiss he said she tasted strongly of metal. The 31-year-old Missouri native told Berkeleyside that it began with a clap of thunder like an explosion. Then came the metallic taste and in a flash the lightning had hit her. 'I saw an orb of light travel down the umbrella handle I was holding in my right hand,' Davis said. 'Thankfully I was holding the plastic end of the umbrella, or else I wouldâ€™ve been in big trouble.' The coffee she carried in her other hand flew from her to the ground as that arm shook uncontrollably and her heart began to race from the fear of it all, she said. 'It was absolutely terrifying,' she said Monday. 'My heart was racing. I am just thankful that my shoes had no metal in them.' Hours after Davis' miraculous escape from serious injury, her boyfriend kissed her goodbye as they parted ways for the evening and said he still tasted of metal. It was a lasting reminder of a terrifying experience that was also an echo from her family's past. When she told her father about the strike, she learned something shocking. 'He told me that my great great great grandfather was struck and killed by lightning while sitting on a horse,' she said. With no physical wounds of her one-in-700,000 experience, Davis is now in search of proof it really happened and has reached out to area business in hopes there is CCTV footage of the strike.

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . A hotly disputed U.S. Senate torture report concludes that waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods provided no key evidence in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, according to congressional aides and outside experts familiar with the investigation . A controversial Senate report has concluded that waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods provided no key evidence in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, according to congressional aides and outside experts familiar with the investigation. Former George W Bush administration and some senior CIA officials have claimed the evidence trail leading to their al Qaeda mastermind's compound in Pakistan vindicated the 'enhanced interrogation techniques' authorized after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But Democratic and some Republican senators have disputed that account, describing simulated drownings, sleep deprivation and other such practices as cruel and ineffective. Congressional aides and outside experts familiar with the investigation told Associated Press the . Senate Intelligence Committee's report on interrogations, renditions and . detentions examined the treatment of several high-level terror detainees and the information they provided on bin Laden. The aides and people briefed on the report spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the confidential document. The most high-profile detainee linked to the bin Laden investigation was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, whom the CIA waterboarded 183 times. Mohammed, intelligence officials have noted, confirmed after his 2003 capture that he knew an important al Qaeda courier with the nom de guerre Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. But the report concludes that such . information was not critical, according to the aides. Mohammed only . discussed al-Kuwaiti months after being waterboarded, while he was under . standard interrogation, they said. And Mohammed neither acknowledged . al-Kuwaiti's significance nor provided interrogators with the courier's . real name. The most high-profile detainee linked to the bin Laden investigation was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (left), whom the CIA waterboarded 183 times. Former Bush administration and some senior CIA officials have claimed the evidence trail leading to bin Laden's Pakistan compound vindicated 'enhanced interrogation techniques' The debate over . how investigators put the pieces together is significant because years . later, the courier led U.S. intelligence to the sleepy Pakistani . military town of Abbottabad. There, Navy SEALs killed bin Laden in a . secret mission. The CIA also has pointed to the value of information provided by senior al Qaeda operative Abu Faraj al-Libi, who was captured in 2005 and held at a secret prison. U.S. officials have described how al-Libi made up a name for a trusted courier and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Al-Libi, they said, was so adamant and unbelievable in his denial that the CIA took it as confirmation he and Mohammed were protecting the courier. But the report concludes evidence gathered from al-Libi wasn't significant either, the aides said. Essentially, they argued, Mohammed, al-Libi and others subjected to harsh treatment confirmed only what investigators already knew about the courier. And when they denied the courier's significance or provided misleading information, investigators would only have considered that significant if they already presumed the courier's importance. The aides did not address information provided by yet another al-Qaida operative: Hassan Ghul, captured in Iraq in 2004. Intelligence officials have described Ghul as the true linchpin of the bin Laden investigation after he identified al-Kuwaiti as a critical courier. In a 2012 news release, Sen. Dianne . Feinstein, D-Calif., the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and . Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., acknowledged an unidentified 'third detainee' had provided relevant information on the courier. But they said he did . so the day before he was subjected to harsh CIA interrogation. 'This . information will be detailed in the Intelligence committee's report,' the senators said at the time. In any case, it still took the CIA years . to learn al-Kuwaiti's real identity: Sheikh Abu Ahmed, a Pakistani man . born in Kuwait. How the U.S. learned of Ahmed's name is still unclear. The Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed at this compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces . Without providing full details, aides said the Senate report illustrates the importance of the National Security Agency's efforts overseas. Intelligence officials have previously described how in the years when the CIA could not find where bin Laden's courier was, NSA eavesdroppers came up with nothing until 2010 - when Ahmed had a telephone conversation with someone monitored by U.S. intelligence. At that point, U.S. intelligence was able to follow Ahmed to bin Laden's hideout. Feinstein and other senators have spoken only vaguely of the contents of the classified review. But they have made references to the divergence between their understanding of how the bin Laden operation came together and assertions of former CIA and Bush administration officials who have defended harsh interrogations. Responding to former CIA deputy director Jose Rodriguez's argument that Mohammed and al-Libi provided the 'lead information' on the bin Laden operation, Feinstein and Levin said, 'The original lead information had no connection to CIA detainees.' Zero Dark Thirty: The hunt for Osama bin Laden was portrayed in the Kathryn Bigelow-directed film in 2012 starring Jessica Chastain (pictured). The film did not shy away from water-boarding . They rejected former CIA Director Michael Hayden's claim that evidence on the couriers began with interrogations at black sites and Attorney General Michael Mukasey's declaration that intelligence leading to bin Laden began with Mohammed. The facts, they said, show that the CIA learned of the courier, his true name and location 'through means unrelated to the CIA detention and interrogation program.' They have cited a 'wide variety of intelligence sources and methods.' Terror suspects who were waterboarded 'provided no new information about the courier' and offered no indication of where bin Laden was hiding, the senators said. Feinstein will push to release a summary of the intelligence committee's review later this week, starting a declassification process that could take several months before any documents are made public. Senate investigators and CIA officials already are locked in a simmering dispute over competing claims of wrongdoing in the congressional investigation. Feinstein accuses the agency of improperly monitoring the computer use of Senate staffers and deleting files, undermining the Constitution's separation of powers. The CIA says the intelligence panel illegally accessed certain documents. The Justice Department is reviewing criminal complaints against both sides. Aides said Levin and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who himself was tortured as a prisoner war in Vietnam more than four decades ago, are among those pushing hard to ensure the investigation's findings related to the bin Laden pursuit and CIA interrogations are made public. They and Feinstein were among Congress' critics of how the hunt was portrayed in the film 'Zero Dark Thirty,' which they said was fictional.","Senators dispute account of former Bush administration and some senior CIA officials that 'enhanced interrogation techniques' were vindicated .

"By . Sam Adams . Targeted: Doctors at a Swedish eating disorders clinic say talent scouts from modelling agencies are targeting their patients (file picture) Modelling agencies have been trying to recruit new talent outside Sweden's biggest eating disorders clinic, its doctors claim. Dr Anna-Maria af Sandeberg said talent scouts were targeting her clinic, in Stockholm, because they know the girls there are 'very thin.' She described the activity as 'repugnant' and said it sends the  'wrong signals when the girls are being treated for eating disorders.' One of the patients approached was so ill she was in a wheelchair, Ms Sandeberg told Sweden's Metro newspaper. The last incident occurred about a year ago she said, which forced the clinic to change its procedures regarding patients going on walks. Many of the girls who were approached were still in their teens, she told the Metro. According to its website the Stockholm Center for Eating Disorders offers treatment for out-patient, day-patient and in-patient services, as well as a mobile unit, a school and two apartments for family treatment. It offers treatment for hundreds of patients of all ages, with focus on bringing 'starvation and binge-eating/vomiting under control.' Some patients at the clinic have a body mass index - which measures a person's height to weight ratio - as low as 14, the Local reports, compared to a healthy BMI for adult women of between 18.5 and 24.9 on the scale. Concerns have been raised worldwide over the influence of super-thin 'size zero' models who some experts claim are unhealthily thin. Critics claim that images of these models should not appear in magazines and on TV programmes watched mainly by teenaged girls in case they try to starve themselves thin. High street clothing firm River Island used a super thin model to launch a catalogue for a new collection last week.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The U.S. federal government appears to have be forcing the shut down of pedophiles communities on the shady underbelly of the Internet by targeting that shadowy eavily-encrypted, secretive sites called the 'Dark Web.' The operation,which has been tracked back to a contractor for the National Security Agency, began with the arrest last week of Irishman Eric Eoin Marques, who the FBI has called 'the biggest facilitator of child pornography on the planet.' Marques is accused of running Freedom Hosting, a web hosting service that operates on the anonymous Tor network. Forums on Freedom Hosting allegedly allowed pedophiles to anonymously share horrific child pornography and trade tips on how to sexually abuse children without getting caught. Eric Eoin Marques appeared in court this week as an Irish court weighed whether to extradite him to the United States . Marques is accused of running Freedom Hosting, which allowed child pornography forums to operate with impunity . Tor is an encrypted network of sites not easily accessed by average internet users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online. Normally, file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user's unique IP address that can be traced back to an individual computer. The Tor network on the Dark Web hides the IP address and the activity of the user. The FBI has requested that Marques, 28, be extradited to the United States to stand trial. But the operation didn't end there. The Daily Dot reports that the day after Marques was arrested, hackers uploaded malicious code to Freedom Hosting's servers. The code was designed to attack the browsers of anyone who accessed the anonymous sites. It reportedly collected internet browser data and surfing history, which could help identify the location of users of the anonymous site. Head in hands: A judge ordered the 28-year-old Irishman held without bail while it is decided whether he should be sent to the U.S. for prosecution . One of the sites that operates on the Dark Web is Silk Road, a black market eBay that sells drugs, stolen identities and even weapons . Tech savvy members of the Dark Web community tracked the attack back to Science Applications International Corp. - a Virginia-based contractor for the NSA. As a result of the attack, pedophiles who had previously trafficked sickening images of child sexual abuse with impunity because the Dark Web offered anonymity, realized that their identities could be compromised. Pedophile message boards that were once bustling with activity suddenly went dark. The administrator of the 4Pedo forum, which operates on the Dark Web, posted a warning to users before he took the forum offline: 'ALL BOARDS HAVE BEEN DELETED TO PROTECT YOU! IF THE BOARDS COME BACK UP, IT IS NOT ME RUNNING THE SITE ANYMORE!' Numerous other pedophile sites on the Dark Web that use Tor encryption have gone offline, as well. Child pornographers aren't the only ones that operate in the shadowy, anonymous reaches of the Internet. The Silk Road, an eBay for the black market, resides there as well. Users can by any number of illegal things on the site - from drugs to stolen identities to illegal weapons and even explosives. Users fear they could be the next target of the U.S. government attack.","Attack on anonymous Dark Web online community tracked back to NSA contractor in Virginia .

Around the same time, he also was arrested by federal authorities on charges including illegally transferring a gun, ammunition and explosive material to a high school student. Jury selection in that case is set to begin in May. Meanwhile, Gotta is being held on $100,000 bail. His next court appearance was scheduled for April 15. Gotta, 55, was taken into custody Monday at his Bridgeport on two counts of fourth-degree sexual assault and five count of fourth-degree sexual assault. The clergyman had been on house arrest since last summer. As a condition of his release, Gotta had to wear an ankle monitoring bracelet, the station WFSB reported. According to federal officials, Gotta helped 18-year-old Kyle Bass acquire a handgun and thousands of rounds of ammunition. He also allegedly helped the teen manufacture a homemade pipe bomb.

Law enforcement officials first came in contact with Gotta last June, when the priest reached out to the feds to report that Bass had weapons and explosives, and that he had made disturbing comments about his school, the Metropolitan Learning Center in Bloomfield, Hartford Courant reported. According to court documents, Gotta said Bass told him, â€˜You should bring your gun with you when you walk your dog. You never know when someone will jump out of the bushes and shoot you or the dog.â€™ . However, in February, Gotta was indicted for allegedly helping Bass get his hands on firearms and bullets. His indictment states that the 55-year-old cleric assisted Bass in buying a gun in Arizona and bringing it back to Connecticut in 2012, along with thousands of bullets. Confined: Rev Gotta had been under house arrest in his Bridgeport home since last summer . Kyle Bass was arrested in June 2013 for allegedly making bombs he had planned to use at his school. When police searched his East Windsor home, they discovered soda bottle silencers, firearms and explosive materials. In January, Bass pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of a silencer. He faces 10 years behind bars, minus three years of suspended sentence, and three years' probation.

Under construction: Carol Sullivan managed to learn enough in a week-long bricklaying course to mean she could start rebuilding her home . She . went on to learn the basics of plumbing and carpentry on similar . courses. A year to the day after she began work she moved into the . detached four-bedroom house, now said to be worth £1million. The . property in Kempshott, near Basingstoke, Hampshire, cost her £180,000 to . build on top of the money she had already lost. Mrs . Sullivan said that all had appeared to be going well with the original . building work until a cold snap of weather. ‘To my horror the mortar . started to fall out of the new walls,’ she said. ‘The builders said . there was nothing wrong.’ Troubles: Torrential rain battered the building project before Mrs Sullivan could get a roof on the home - flooding the ground floor . Plumbed in: Mrs Sullivan also enrolled on a plumbing course and installed, left, underfloor heating and pipework . Finishing touches: The four-bedroom home build by Carol Sullivan, pictured nearing completion, is now valued at £1million . But . a test by the Institute of Builders showed the workmen had used only . one shovel of mortar for every 19 shovels of sand – a normal ratio would . be four or five to one. Mrs . Sullivan said: ‘I was totally gutted and ordered the builders to leave . the site immediately. I got the foundations checked and they too weren’t . sufficient. 'Because the house was unsafe I had no choice but to . completely knock it down. ‘I . didn’t do anything with the site for a while and then one day I said to . my husband, Viv, “Can it really be that hard to lay bricks?” Dream home: Mrs Sullivan installed a luxury kitchen in her £1million, four-bedroom home in Basingstoke, Hampshire . 'I found a . week-long course that started the following Monday for £250. Viv was . very supportive and came with me. ‘Normally . these courses teach you to build a garden wall, an arch and a chimney . breast. I said to the tutors that I’d like to learn how to build a . house. I knew it would be a huge challenge but I didn’t have any other . choice.’ She put her job as a . divorce lawyer on hold to get up at 6am and spend the day laying bricks . from Monday to Friday, with Mr Sullivan, 58, helping her at weekends. Determined: Cowboy builders left the lawyer, 50, without a home but she turned adversity into triumph by learning the skills to build the house herself . ‘A . year to the day since I started we moved in,’ she said. ‘At that point . the house was just a shell. I did everything from the plumbing to the . electrics to the carpentry. 'The only things I couldn’t do was the . roofing, levelling the concrete and the plaster work. ‘I’m over the moon. I could have chucked it all in but I stuck at it and have the house of my dreams.’","Carol Sullivan was homeless after cowboy builders wrecked her bungalow .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Romanian princess and her husband, a former sheriff's deputy have reportedly been arrested in connection with an alleged cockfighting ring. Irina Walker, 60, and her husband John . Wesley Walker, 67, are charged with hosting cockfighting derbies and illegal . gambling at their ranch outside the small Morrow County town of Irrigon. Federal prosecutors are seeking forfeiture of the ranch, listed in state incorporation records as Stokes Landing Sport Horses. Allegations: Irina Walker, 60, and her husband John Wesley Walker, 67, are charged with hosting cockfighting derbies and illegal gambling at their ranch outside the small Morrow County town of Irrigon . The Oregonian newspaper identified Irina Walker, also known as Irina Kreuger, as a daughter of the last king of Romania. Personnel records show John Wesley Walker was a Coos County sheriff's deputy from 1998 to 2003. The Walkers and four other people from Irrigon and Hermiston were to be arraigned in federal court in Portland on Friday on charges of operating an illegal gambling business. No lawyer for the Walkers or other defendants was listed as yet in court records. Twelve others from Oregon and Washington face lesser charges of conspiracy to violate the Animal Welfare Act through illegal animal fighting. They are to be arraigned in Portland and Yakima, Wash. 'Cockfighting is illegal under federal law and under the laws of all 50 states,' Amanda Marshall, U.S. attorney for Oregon, said in a statement. Twelve others from Oregon and Washington face lesser charges of conspiracy to violate the Animal Welfare Act through illegal animal fighting . 'Besides being a barbaric practice, cockfighting jeopardizes public health and safety and facilitates the commission of other criminal acts.' The indictment said 10 different cockfighting derbies were held at the Walker's ranch between April 2012 and April 2013, bringing in as much as $2,000 a day. Blades were attached to the birds' legs, spectators were charged admission, and food and drink were sold, the indictment said. The four others charged with being part of the gambling business are Mario Perez, 62, of Hermiston; David Sanchez, 29, of Irrigon; Jose Luis Virgen Ramirez, 48, of Hermiston; and Aurelia Garcia Mendoza, 33, of Irrigon. The exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania attended the baptism of Princess Irina's daughter in Portland in 1987.

"By . Associated Press . When it comes to rescuing damsels, it doesn't get more disssstresssing than having to save a snake. But a firefighter put his high school reptile-handling experience to good use on Sunday night when he pulled a 6-foot-long pet python from a burning home in western Michigan. Muskegon firefighter Scott Hemmelsbach told The Muskegon Chronicle that he reluctantly agreed to enter the two-story, smoke-filled house to retrieve the snake after all his colleagues had refused the job. He says he cradled the 'weighty' snake like he would a child before carrying it to safety. 'I would do it for any creature': Firefighter Scott Hemmelsbach holds a python after, somewhat reluctantly, rescuing it from a burning home in Muskegon, Mich., on Sunday . 'It was trying to crawl up the side of his terrarium and get out,' Hemmelsbach explained. 'His face was pushed up on the screen and trying to get out. There was a lot of smoke and he was trapped.' The firefighter said he learned how to handle snakes while he was at Grand Haven High School, where he helped showcase them. 'I'd take them around and show them to the kids in the elementary classes,' he said. 'That didn't bother me at all.' When Hemmelsbach reached the python inside the home, he gingerly handled him so not to scare the reptile. 'I removed the screen off the top and knew to approach it by coming up behind his head. He became very active, and I was glad because that meant that he was OK.' Two people in the home escaped without injury, fire officials said. The fire significantly damaged the home, and the cause remains under investigation. 'I would do it for any creature,' Hemmelsbach said. 'I'm just glad it had a happy ending.'","Fire broke out in a two-story house on Sunday night in western Michigan .

"By . James  Nye . A man accused of beheading a Topeka resident with a guitar string has pleaded innocent to premeditated first-degree murder. Police say 29-year-old James Paul Harris practiced voodoo and kept the head of 49-year-old James Gerety to talk to after the March or April 2011 killing. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Gerety's partial remains were found a year later in Carbondale, 18 miles south of Topeka. Decapitation charge: James Paul Harris, left, is escorted from the Osage County Courthouse in Lyndon, Kansas last month for a court appearance after being accused of beheading James Gerety with a guitar string three years ago . Harris' former girlfriend testified in March that he told her he used a guitar string to sever Gerety's head. She said he disposed of the body but kept the head in a bag. A Topeka police officer said the ex-girlfriend told him Harris practiced voodoo and that he liked to talk to the head. A judge on Monday set Harris' trial for June 23. Thomas Henderson, an attorney who handled Gerety's Social Security . payments, testified at the March hearing that he reported Gerety missing . in April 2011 after he failed to pick up his payments. Henderson said . Gerety planned to live with Harris in Carbondale, 18 miles south of . Topeka. Dressed in a bright orange jumpsuit, Harris appeared in court under heavy guard for the 30 minute hearing - six Osage County sheriff deputies watched him sat with his two attorneys. He is charged with the premeditated first-degree murder of James Gerety, who authorities believe was killed between March 3, 2011 and April 20, 2011. On March 14 in a pre-trial hearing, former girlfriend, Bobbie Williams testified that Harris told her he killed Gerety using a guitar string, disposed of the body, but kept the head in a bag for himself. Murdered: Harris is charged with the premeditated first-degree murder in the death of James Gerety, (pictured) who died in March or April of 2011 . Another witness at that hearing, Topeka police Detective Brian Hill said that during questioning after his arrest, Harris told him that he kept the victim's head in a canvas bag with a draw string. Hill testified that Harris spoke to the head, and had an active interest in voodoo and practiced it. According to Harris' former girlfriend, Harris told her that he had shot the victim in the stomach and then tortured him for two days at their Topeka house. After he had finished with his brutal treatment of Gerety, Harris then decapitated him with the string, according to Williams' testimony. Then, Harris is said to have put Gerety's torso, arms and legs in a barrel and burried it on land owned by his father, Jeff Harris in Osage County. Harris' girlfriend testified in March that he said he severed Gerety's head with a guitar string. A Topeka police officer testified that he was told Harris kept the head so he could talk to it as part of a voodoo ritual . Williams testified in court that she saw Gerety's head once, but then claimed later on that she was mistaken. She did tell the court that Harris kept a voodoo doll named 'Jimbo', 'Bob on the Hill' and 'Poor Jimbo Bolinsky'. The doll hung from the ceiling in their apartment. Gerety's skull was recovered on March 24, 2012, at Jeff Harris' home by his girlfriend, Shirley Johnson. She had been on the hunt for mushrooms when she found a ball barely buried and brought it inside to show Harris' father, who promptly called the police and his son was arrested. Harris was in federal custody on unrelated charges when a warrant was . issued in October 2013 and he was placed on hold for Kansas authorities. In January, Harris filed a request to have the hold resolved and he was . booked into the Osage County jail in March for court proceedings.","James Paul Harris, 29, is to face trial for decapitating 49-year-old James Gerety in 2011 with a guitar string .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . From Harajuku girls to Cosplay, Japan's fashionistas are famous for their love of colour, quirky sense of style and penchant for dressing up the frilliest ensembles they can lay their hands on. Now Tokyo's famously eccentric style scene is the subject of a new book, Tokyo Adorned, which shows off the wonderfully girly Kawaii style in all its colourful glory. One of the most creative Tokyo style tribes, Kawaii girls dress to show off their individuality with takes on the look ranging from the Lolita (sweet and girly) to Gotchi (Gothic). Pastel explosion: Tokyo women take sweet and girly dressing to the extreme and it seems they have no fear of over accessorising . Think pink: Kawaii girls love the colour and covert pale skin and clothes with frills, bows and lace . Living dolls: Tokyo Adorned reveals how many of the looks emulate the porcelain toys . 'There’s this aspiration to be cute, and they find that to be incredibly empowering and strong,' explained author and photographer, Thomas Card, in an interview with the Daily Beast. 'For these girls, it’s this process of dressing that allows you to see them for who they are. They're constantly changing themselves... If you were to go tomorrow, they would be different again.' The antithesis of fake-tanned hair-extensioned TOWIE chic, Kawaii girls like pink, kitsch, tutus, delicate dabs of glitter, enormous false lashes and ultra pale skin. The most common Kawaii style is named the 'classic Lolita', which despite referencing the Nabokov novel in the name, has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute, girlish and pretty as possible. Based on frilled and furbelowed Victorian styles combined with a hint of goth, girls hope to achieve a porcelain-doll look using lashings of lace, ribbon, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Dare to scare: Gothic is another of the favoured looks, known as Gotchi . Too cute: The women think such an appearance is empowering and looking girly and pretty is known as the 'classic Lolita', right . Style fusion: Some women combine the pastels with the gothic while others create looks of their own like this military inspired outfit with hints of Minnie Mouse, right . Victorian homage: The girls are fond of lashings of lace, ribbon, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats . Then there's the 'Sweet Lolita' look. Featuring even more ribbons, bows, and lace, than the 'Classic Lolita', it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels. Fairy Kei is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets, teamed with lighter, less extreme make-up. Unsurprisingly, the look has also proved a hit with British teens, some of whom take part in the annual Kawaii fashion show at Hyper Japan, an annual celebration of all things Japanese held at London's Earl's Court each July. Turning back the clock: The 'Sweet Lolita' look goes overboard on pastels and kitsch with false eyelashes and childish accessories . Constantly changing: One day the women could go for a vintage ladylike style, while the next, a gas mask is on trend . One girl who took part in last year's . show is Grace St. John, a fan of the 'Sweet Lolita' style of Kawaii . dressing, which includes piling on the lace, bows and frills in order to . appear as sweet and girly as possible. But while she loves wearing the look, she does admit it can cause the odd raised eyebrow while out and about in London. 'Sometimes . being a Kawaii girl can be hard as a lot of people don't understand the . fashion, and will shout at you in the street,' she reveals. 'But . I do get a lot of people coming up to me and telling me how much they . like my style too. I went from loving Kawaii things to being a bit of a . kawaii-aholic!' Tokyo .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Pennsylvania woman is outraged after being ordered by a judge to stop breastfeeding her 10-month-old daughter as part of the terms of a custody dispute. Jessica Moser, from Northampton County, said she was told by a family court judge two weeks ago to nursing her daughter Jasmine so the little girl can spend two days a week with her father. Moser said she can't pump enough milk for two days and that Jasmine will not take a bottle. 'I'm feeling frustrated ... hurt,' she told WFMZ-TV. 'I'm trying to keep myself from crying, it's very emotional. 'If I do not comply I will have my child taken away.' Scroll down for video . This must stop: New mum Jessica Moser has been told by a judge to switch her daughter Jasmine to formula from breastfeeding so that she can spend each weekend with her father. The case has sparked quite a debate . 'I'm emotional and hurt': Pennsylvania mom Jessica Moser fights back tears as she explains how her custody battle may force her to stop breastfeeding . Moser has had primary custody of Jasmine since she was born last December. However now the father has pressed for more time with his daughter. Moser said she is not trying to keep Jasmine from her father - she just wants to continue breastfeeding. The World Health Organization recommends that all babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months, then start eating solid foods, while continuing to nurse for at least two years. However Moser said the judge told her to switch to formula. 'He did say something along the lines like, ''well she should be on formula'', or ''why isnâ€™t she on formula?'', ''she should be able to have formula at ten months'',' she said. The World Health Organization recommends mothers breastfeed their children for the first two years, if possible . However the mom maintains that being able to choose when to stop breastfeed is her right and hers alone. 'I'm very passionate about having the right to breastfeed,' she said. 'The breast is best and that's what I'm trying to do for her.' An attorney for the father did no return calls for comment. The story has ignited a debate among mothers and parenting blogs. Frances Locke from Mommyish wrote an editorial saying the father should 'be ashamed'. 'Custody battles are complicated, personal and often brutal,' she wrote. Controversy: Breastfeeding in the media usually sparks debate, but TIME magazine created a stir with one of its covers in May 2012, featuring a mother nursing her three-year-old son. It reignited a long-running dialogue over when mothers should stop breastfeeding . 'With this situation we don't have all the facts so it's hard to point fingers, but I don't think this has to be an either-or situation. 'This child should be able to see her dad and continue nursing - and the judge should encourage this option, not tell mom to stop nursing and use formula. 'Itâ€™s important for a child to have a bond with both parents and for a baby to be nourished with her motherâ€™s milk. 'Unless there are details that haven't come out yet, I think ... the father should be ashamed. Emily Gillette (center) was sitting against the window of a Delta Connection flight with her husband in 2006 when a flight attendant gave her a blanket and told her to cover up.

In 2006, New Mexico mom Emily Gillette was kicked off a Delta Connections flight for breast-feeding her 22-month-old daughter and refusing to cover up. Gillette filed a federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Burlington, Vermont, in 2009.

"By . Sarah Bridge . You could say that their love is set in stone. Or that their relationship is as solid as a rock. Whichever way you pun it, it is unlikely to be a proposal that Kelly Aldridge, 30, from Tewkesbury, will ever forget. Her boyfriend Oliver Wright, 31, secretly arranged rocks to spell out 'Kelly, will you marry me?' in a quarry at the foot of Leckhampton Hill near Cheltenham where the couple often go walking. Saying it with stones: Oliver Wright and girlfriend Kelly with his novel proposal . The nervous chap then led his unsuspecting girlfriend on a trek up to the top of the hill to a point where she could look down and read the romantic proposal. 'I was completely overwhelmed,' said Kelly, 30. 'We were walking along holding hands and it was a beautiful sunny morning then Oliver suddenly stopped. More... Peter Andre and Emily MacDonagh introduce their baby daughter to the world... as they reveal they're ENGAGED . Man for hire! Woman rents out her husband for cash... but before you get any ideas, it's strictly for domestic duties and heavy lifting . Marriage in a crisis? Try a spot of gardening. It worked for Karen, as she reveals in this utterly enchanting account . 'I looked at him, then looked down the cliff and that's when I saw it. I just froze, I couldn't believe it.' The personal assistant from Tewkesbury said she had no hesitation in accepting the proposal. 'Then I said ""yes, yes, yes"" and he went down on one knee and got the ring out.' Oliver Wright proposed to his girlfriend Kelly Aldridge by spelling out the question with rocks . The pair then savoured the moment over a glass of bubbly. She added: 'We went down to the bottom of the hill and Oliver pulled out a bottle of champagne from behind a rock and poured two glasses. 'We sat there and celebrated with a glass of champagne despite it only being 11 o'clock in the morning. Walkers at the top of the hill shouted down their congratulations to us. It was a really special moment and one I will remember for the rest of my life.' The couple have been seeing each other for nearly a year since they met via a dating website. It took five hours for Oliver to set out the stones at the bottom of Leckhampton Hill near Cheltenham . Oliver, who works as a chef at upmarket Willoughby House Hotel in Cheltenham, said he knew Kelly was the girl for him at their very first meeting. And, he admitted, he had been planning the romantic rock proposal since securing Kelly's father's permission over Christmas. 'I have always loved going to Leckhampton Hill, and I have seen people write things with rocks there before, so I thought why not?' he told the Gloucestershire Echo. 'It is our favourite place to go, and it's also where we went on our first walk together as a couple. 'I went up to arrange the rocks the week before. It took me about five hours but I wanted to get it just right. Kelly didn't think twice about saying yes. The happy couple are now planning their wedding . 'Then every day during the week I went to check on them to make sure they were still there. It was a lovely sunny morning and we virtually had the hill to ourselves when we reached the top. I'm just glad she said yes.' The couple plan to move in together in Cheltenham and want to wed later this year or early in 2015. Now it seems that Oliver's actions may have helped another couple decide to take the plunge. When the newly-engaged pair went back to the site days later the rocks had been changed to 'Carla, will you marry me?' If she finds out that the proposal was meant for another, Carla's boyfriend might be in for rather a rocky time...","Oliver Wright, 31, proposed to Kelly Aldridge, 30, above a quarry .

"Kirk charged with a felony after he allegedly attempted to intimidate the woman out of testifying against him . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Frank Kirk, 70, was arrested last month after he allegedly brought sex toys to a woman at the county jail . An attorney has been charged after he allegedly tried to prevent a female inmate from testifying against him over sex acts he engaged in with her in prison. Frank Kirk, 70, from Oklahoma, was arrested last month after he allegedly engaged in lewd acts with the woman at the county jail. Kirk brought sex toys, lubricant, baby wipes and a cell phone into the jail in a hidden compartment of his laptop bag, court documents revealed. The female alleged that Kirk gave her the items so that he could watch her masturbate, according to a probable cause affidavit seen by newsok.com. The prisoner also alleges that he told her to expose her breasts and forced her to touch his penis. Kirk allegedly duped the woman into performing the acts over a three-month period in exchange for her legal fees - despite the fact that he was never actually her lawyer. The woman, who is jailed on drug charges, is represented by the public defender's office so it is unclear why she believed Kirk to be her lawyer. Her identity has been withheld. Kirk was arrested on March 3 after the sex acts allegedly took place four of the six times that Kirk visited the inmate in jail. On March 21, Kirk allegedly contacted the woman to try to intimidate her out of testifying against him. 'The victim was fearful of testifying against Kirk', the affidavit reads, according to newsok.com. He was charged on Monday with one felony count of attempting to prevent a witness from testifying. He was also charged with five misdemeanor counts of lewdness. Kirk is out on $10,000 bail.

"By . James  Nye . The youngest victim of the devastating Washington landslide was seconds away from a tragic death - but instead was plucked from the debris by one good Samaritan. If Kody Wesson had been driving through Oso along Highway 530 seconds earlier, he would have been killed by the landslide that destroyed the home of Amanda Skorjanc and her 22-week-old son, Duke Saddarth. As it happens, Wesson was able to race to the rescue and trudge straight into the monstrous mess and save Duke and alert emergency services to Amanda. Scroll down for video . Hero and survivor: Kody Wesson pulls five-month-old baby Duke Saddarth from the debris left in the immediate aftermath of the Oso, Washington landslide which has claimed the lives of at least 18 people . Ignoring the commands of a state trooper not to enter the devastation, Wesson climed into the debris field to look for survivors. 'You gotta help 'em. How can you not? What are you supposed to do, you can't just stand there and watch,' said Wesson. Spotting Duke on the floor, Wesson rushed to hep. 'I could see the baby's face. It was all bruised up,' said Wesson who also tended to Amanda, whose legs were broken. Wesson wrapped the baby in his coat and carried Duke to safety past witness, Paulo Falcao. 'Something positive from the mudslide, a six-month-old baby. So precious,' said Falcao to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Good Samaritan: Kody Wesson explained how he pulled baby Duke from the rubble and tended to his mother Amanda when he rushed to the rescue eight days ago . Mom and baby: Amanda Skorjanc and her son Duke Saddarth both survived and the five-month-old is in a serious condition but improving at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle . Duke is listed in serious condition and improving at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. His mother, 25-year-old Amanda Skorjanc, is in satisfactory condition at the hospital. Three men rescued from the March 22 slide also are at the hospital. A 37-year-old is in serious condition in intensive care. An 81-year-old in serious condition in intensive care. And a 58-year-old is in satisfactory condition. The family of the mother and baby released a statement through the hospital, saying: 'We are so grateful to all the responders who jeopardized their safety in order to pull Duke and Amanda out of the debris. 'Words alone cannot tell you how thankful we are. Our hearts and support continue to go out to everyone who has been affected by this tragedy.'

An American flag pulled from the debris hangs in the staging area at the west side of the mudslide on Highway 530 near mile marker 37, in Arlington . Families coping with the loss of friends, neighbors and normalcy sought comfort in church services Sunday, as crews worked to recover more victims from the soggy pile of mud that buried the small mountainside community of Oso, Wash., more than a week ago. Rescue crews said Sunday that many of the dogs that have been essential in the search for victims will take a two-day break. Days of sniffing through cold, soupy mud and nearly nonstop rain have taken their toll on the animals, and officials say dogs can lose their sensing ability if they work too long. 'The conditions on the slide field are difficult, so this is just a time to take care of the dogs,' said Kris Rietmann, lead spokeswoman for the team working on the eastern portion of the slide. Dogs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, more recent arrivals on the scene, will continue working, said Heidi Amrine, another spokeswoman for the operation. Engineers were watching for any material sloughing off the landslide area, making sure that a weekend of torrential rainfall doesn't displace more land.

Meanwhile, many residents attended church services for solace ahead of another week of recovery efforts. 'I can only compare it to a hot hearty meal after a very cold day,' Slava Botamanenko of Darrington said of the church services. Botamanenko works at the hospital in Arlington and said he spent two nights there to be sure he was available for work after the slide shut the road. Late Saturday, authorities said the number of people believed missing decreased substantially, from 90 to 30. The official death toll of victims identified by the medical examiner increased to 21, said Jason Biermann, program manager at the Snohomish County Department of Emergency Management. Authorities have said they have recovered more than two dozen bodies, but they won't be added to the official tally until a formal identification is made. A small rubber duck sits on a pile of assorted debris. Periods of rain and wind have hampered efforts the past two days, with some rain showers continuing Sunday . A flag flies at half-staff on a log with the slope of the massive mudslide that struck Oso in the background near Darrington, Washington . Dwarfed: The size of the debris field is also smaller than initially thought, officials said Sunday. After further scientific review and analysis, geologists have determined that the size of the debris field is about 300 acres in size . And, underscoring the difficulty of identifying those killed in one of the deadliest landslides in U.S. history, Biermann said crews are not always discovering complete remains. This weekend, crews completed a makeshift road that will link one side of the debris field to the other, significantly easing the recovery operation. They've also been working to clear mud and debris from the highway, leaving piles of gooey muck, splintered wood and housing insulation on the sides of the road. Searchers have had to contend with treacherous conditions. The search area has septic tanks, gasoline, propane tanks and other hazards. When rescuers and search dogs leave, they're hosed off by hazardous materials crews stationed at the edges of the debris field. The slide dammed up the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, causing water to pool up on the east side. The river cut a new channel through the mud, but torrential weekend rainfall has raised the water level nearly a foot, Rietmann said Sunday.

'At this point there's no point in searching (that area) again until the water drops back down,' Pierce said. Rescuers should get some relief soon. Mainly dry weather is forecast Monday through Wednesday in Western Washington. The size of the debris field is also smaller than initially thought, officials said Sunday. After further scientific review and analysis, geologists have determined that the size of the debris field is about 300 acres in size. That's just under half the size of the earlier projected one square mile. Away from the whirring chain saws and roaring bulldozers, many residents of the nearby community of Darrington sought quiet comfort in church services.

Relief: Rescuers should get some relief soon. Mainly dry weather is forecast Monday through Wednesday in Western Washington . All week, a steady stream of people has stopped in to pray at the Glad Tidings Assembly of God on the edge of town, Senior Pastor Les Hagen said. 'At a time like this, everybody knows they've got to have God's help,' Hagen said. Steve Huot, lead chaplain for the Arlington Fire Department, is seeing people in varying emotional states related to the disaster. Some are in shock while others seem to have grasped the grim reality of the situation. Many are exhausted. He said there's nothing 'key' to say to people. 'It's more about listening right now. You need to encourage them and maybe change their focus to staying busy for the group, for the team,' he said. 'You might need to drive them into something productive and make sure that they feel a sense of accomplishment and contribution.'","Picture has emerged of the moment that five-month-old Duke Saddarth was plucked from the aftermath of the Washington landslide by a good Samaritan .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman charged with murdering a man she met off Craigslist with the help of her newlywed husband made up the claim that she killed more than 20 people and is drawing on the escapades of television serial killer 'Dexter,' according to her sister said. Miranda Barbour is 'a master at lying,' sister Ashley Dean told The Daily Item newspaper of Sunbury, Pennsylvania. 'She takes a lot of truths and puts the lie in the middle so when people talk to her they see all these truths and then they believe the lie,' Dean told the newspaper. Fatal stories: Miranda Barbour (pictured today) is formally charged in one murder but she claims that she and her husband were responsible for the deaths of more than 20 people- claims that her sister disputes . Hearing her out: Miranda, 19, has pleaded not guilty saying that she felt forced to kill as a result of a Satanic cult . Dean said she hasn't spoken to her sister since Barbour was arrested December 3. When she heard her sister had been arrested, she assumed it was for drugs because her sister had a drug problem. The 19-year-old Barbour was in Northumberland County court on Tuesday morning for a pretrial hearing. Barbour is awaiting trial on charges she killed a man she allegedly lured through a Craigslist ad offering companionship for money. She and her husband, Elytte Barbour, have pleaded not guilty. Investigators allege the young woman stabbed 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara about 20 times in her parked car as Elytte Barbour held a cord tight against LaFerrara's neck from the back seat and then dumped his body in an alley. Victim: Troy LaFerrara, 42 (pictured) was found stabbed and strangled to death in Pennsylvania in November after he reportedly responded to a Craigslist ad posted by the Barbours advertising female companionship . Accomplice: Elyette Barbour (pictured at an earlier hearing) allegedly told police he and his wife, Miranda Barbour, wanted to kill together . In a jailhouse interview with The Daily Item, Barbour admitted to LaFerrara's slaying and said she had killed at least 22 other people from Alaska to North Carolina in the last six years as part of her involvement in a satanic cult. She told the newspaper that she targeted people 'who did bad things and didn't deserve to be here anymore.' Investigators say they have found no evidence to substantiate her claims about a cross-country killing spree. Ashley Dean said Elytte Barbour loved the TV show 'Dexter,' and suggested that her sister was repeating its justifications for killing. 'If you listen to what she is saying, she is using descriptions from the show,' Dean told The Daily Item. In 'Dexter,' a Miami Police Department blood-spatter analyst secretly sought out proven killers and killed them to prevent them from finding more victims. Stealing from TV: Miranda's sister says that her sister's husband, Elyette, loved the TV show 'Dexter,' and suggested that her sister was repeating its justifications for killing . Behind the stories: Local investigators in three murder locations named by Barbour are taking the claims seriously, but said they have no unresolved homicides they know about . Dean's assertions make her at least the second relative to cast doubt on her tale. Barbour's father, Sonny Dean, told The Daily Item in February that his daughter was a heroin addict, a liar and a manipulator who 'lives in a fantasy world.' Barbour claimed in her first jailhouse interview on February 14 that she killed at least 22 other people over six years in a cross-country murder spree motivated by her satanic cult beliefs. During her second jailhouse interview at the State Correctional Institution in Muncy, a maximum security womenâ€™s prison, Barbour repeated her claims and said the FBI have not questioned her. The Daily Item reported that local investigators in three murder locations named by Barbour are taking the claims seriously, but said they have no unresolved homicides they know about. Barbour said she dumped some body parts in Big Lake, Alaska, and also in Mexico Beach, Florida where she worked as a 15-year-old go-go dancer. She also said she dumped a body off Interstate 95 near Raleigh, North Carolina.","Miranda Barbour and her husband are accused of killing a man they 'lured to their house off Craigslist' but she claims there were more than 20 others .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Nearly a year after Jodi Arias was found guilty of brutally murdering her ex-boyfriend, an Arizona jury panel is being asked to decide the fate of another woman charged with an eerily similar crime. Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36, is accused of bludgeoning her husband with a hammer at their Gilbert, Arizona, home in 2009. She told investigators that Dale Harrell, 34, had physically and sexually abused her in the past, and that she killed him in self-defense. Scroll down for video . Awaiting verdict: Marissa Devault will learn her fate when an Arizona jury returns a verdict  in her murder trial concerning the 2009 killing of her husband . Doppelgangers: Devault (right) has been compared to 33-year-old Jodi Arias (left), who was found guilty of murdering her boyfriend last year - and whom Devault befriended in jail . Prosecutors, however, contend the . January 2009 attack on a sleeping Mr Harrell was premeditated and . motivated by her desire to obtain an insurance settlement so she could . pay back her boyfriend the $300,000 she had borrowed. They . say the 36-year-old Devault has given conflicting accounts of her . husband's death and that people who the woman claimed had witnessed some . of the past abuse didn't back up her claims. Harrell died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries. The . case went to the Maricopa County Superior Court jury Monday, two months . after the start of the trial, and deliberations resumed this morning. Dale Harrell, 34: He suffered multiple skull fractures at the couple's home in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert and died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries . Devault's . case has been compared to the trial of Jodi Arias, who was found . guilty of first-degree murder last May for slashing, stabbing and . shooting to death Travis Alexander in his Mesa, Arizona, home in June . 2008. Like in the Harrell murder, Arias claimed self-defense, accusing her longtime on-again, off-again lover of being abusive, ABC News reported. And . the similarities between the two women do not end there: the cases were . tried in the same Maricopa County courtroom, and both Arias and Devault . could face the death penalty. With their long dark hair and eyeglasses, the two women even look strangely alike. It . has been reported that the 36-year-old Devault befriended the . 33-year-old convicted killer while the two were in jail together. In . an interrogation video recorded just hours after the bloody attack, . Devault could be seen chuckling as she recounts the events of the night, . raising her arm in a motion mimicking hammer blows. â€˜I saw a hammer go into Darrellâ€™s head,â€™ she says with a nervous smile. Prosecutor . Michelle Arino said at the start of the trail in February that Mrs . Devault needed quick money to get out of her deep financial hole. But . one of Devault's attorneys raised questions about the credibility of . his client's boyfriend, who was given an immunity agreement on child . pornography allegations in exchange for his testimony. Authorities said Devault fatally wounded Dale Harrell by bludgeoning him over the head with a hammer as he slept in their suburban Phoenix home in January 2009. Disturbing: Devault is seen smiling while demonstrating for investigators just hours after the attack how the hammer (right) entered her husband's skull . Key witness: Businessman Allen Flores, who was Devault's boyfriend, testified for the prosecution against the woman who owed him $300,000 . Harrell, 34, suffered multiple skull fractures and died a month after the attack. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Devault. Alan Tavassoli, one of Devault's attorneys, said prosecutors are giving a pass to his client's boyfriend, businessman Allen Flores, even after he failed to report to police that Devault had allegedly claimed three days before the hammer attack that her husband had been killed in a tire-iron beating. At first, Devault told investigators that Harrell had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious. She told police that when she came to, she saw another man who lived at their Gilbert home beating Harrell with a hammer. But authorities say blood spatter showed Harrell was alone in the bed at the time of the attack and that bloodstains on Devault's clothes were consistent with a person swinging an object repeatedly over her head. Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36: She claims killing Dale Harrell was an act of self-defense and told investigators that her husband had physically and sexually abused her in the past . Investigators say Devault later confessed, saying she attacked her sleeping husband in a rage after he had sexually assaulted her. Police said they discovered Devault had been dating another man, Flores, for more than two years. In a search of Flores' computer, police say they found a journal that appeared to be written from his perspective and indicated that he had given Devault about $7,000, which she used to hire a hit man, according to court records. The prosecution said Devault needed to repay a $294,000 loan from her boyfriend. Authorities said child pornography also was found on Flores' computer. County prosecutors granted Flores immunity on that allegation in exchange for his testimony in the murder case.

"By . Associated Press . The family of a 4-year-old Massachusetts boy killed in an escalator accident at a mall has reached a settlement in a negligence lawsuit. Mark DiBona of Dudley fell from a second-floor escalator about 18 feet onto a display case below inside a department store at the Auburn Mall in March 2011 while shopping with family. He suffered head injuries and died the next day. His parents sued the mall's owner, the store, the escalator's manufacture and the contractor that installed it, alleging the escalator was in 'dangerous and defective' condition. Tragedy: The family of 4-year-old Mark DiBona have reached an $11.5 million settlement in a lawsuit after their son died after falling from a Massachusetts department store escalator . Laura and Mark: The lawsuit was settled earlier this year and although the terms are confidential, a lawyer magazine has revealed the settlement was for $11.5 million . Public Safety Commissioner Thomas E. Gatzunis said the state officials 'failed to properly inspect the unit' and left it in an unsafe condition. A . barricade that should have been between the side of the escalator and . the wall was missing creating a gap 'larger than allowed by code.' The tragic boy was shopping with his . family and a friend when he rushed towards the escalators on the second . floor of the Sears department store. He grabbed the moving rail with both hands but was dragged through the small gap between the escalator and Plexiglas barrier. Happier times: The boy's parents, Eric (pictured) and Laura DiBona, filed a negligence lawsuit in June 2011 . Fateful: Little Mark DiBona grabbed the moving rail of an escalator in the Sears department store before being dragged through a gap and falling onto a jewellery display case below . Gone too soon: Little Mark DiBona of Dudley fell from a second-floor escalator about 18 feet onto a display case below inside a department store at the Auburn Mall in March 2011 while shopping with family. He suffered head injuries and died the next day . Mr Gatzunis added: 'The code requires a barricade for openings over five inches. This opening was six and a quarter inches.’ A lawyer for the boy's parents, Laura and Eric DiBona, tells The Telegram & Gazette that the lawsuit was settled earlier this year but said terms were confidential. 'The family can never get over this, but it does end this chapter,' said the family's lawyer, W. Thomas Smith of the Boston law firm Sugarman and Sugarman. 'It resolves the legal matter, which was important to the family.' Massachusetts Lawyer's Weekly reported in Monday's edition that Mr. Smith and his associate, Stacey L. Pietrowicz, who also worked on the suit, were the lawyers in an $11.5 million settlement involving a boy who suffered a fatal head injury in a fall from a mall escalator. Mr. Smith said the out-of-court settlement was agreed on within the last two months. He declined to reveal the terms of the confidential agreement. The death led to a crackdown on escalator safety across the state. Lawsuit: Little Marks parents sued the mall¿s owner, the store, the escalator¿s manufacture and the contractor that installed it, alleging the escalator was in 'dangerous and defectiven condition . Scene: The horrific incident happened at Auburn Mall in Worcester, Massachusetts, where the child's family and a friend had been shopping . Lessons learned:After the accident, the state also re-inspected the state's 927 escalators and found that 69 lacked barricades and others were missing top or bottom barricades . A spokesman for Sears, Howard Riefs, said in an email: 'Sears is pleased that Schindler Elevator Company, one of the largest and most highly respected escalator companies in the United States, which was responsible for installing and maintaining the escalators at its Auburn store, has now reached a settlement with the DiBona family.' 'We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the DiBona family and are pleased that this matter has been resolved,' the statement added. The boy's death sparked a crackdown by state public safety officials, including the firing of two escalator inspectors and the disciplining of nearly two-thirds of the state's escalator inspectors for failing to catch similar code violations.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Daniel Martin . David Cameron today vowed to 'challenge the extremist narrative' of some Islamic organisations as he ordered an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood to check whether it is planning attacks in the Middle East from Britain. The Prime Minister said he wanted to establish a 'complete picture' of the group's 'philosophy and activities', with information being gathered by both MI5 and MI6. The review was prompted by evidence received by the Government that Brotherhood leaders met in London last year to plot their response to events in Egypt. Prime Minister David Cameron addressed reporters at a press conference alongside Italian PM Matteo Renzi . Speaking at a No 10 news conference, Mr Cameron said that the Government was committed to encouraging people away from the path of extremism. 'We want to challenge the extremist narrative that some Islamist organisations have put out,' he told reporters following talks with new Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi. 'What I think is important about the Muslim Brotherhood is that we understand what this organisation is, what it stands for, what its beliefs are in terms of the path of extremism and violent extremism, what its connections are with other groups, what its presence is here in the United Kingdom. Our policies should be informed by a complete picture of that knowledge,' he said. 'It is an important piece of work because because we will only get our policy right if we fully understand the true nature of the organisation that we are dealing with.' Handshake: David Cameron, pictured with Mohammed Morsi - the Brotherhood chief who was elected president of Egypt then deposed last year . It was reported last night that the probe will include assessments from MI6, the foreign intelligence service, into whether the body was behind a spate of recent attacks in Egypt. The domestic intelligence service, MI5, will be asked to look into how many senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood are based in the UK. The inquiry will also look into claims that leaders of the organisation met in London late last year to decide its strategy. There are concerns that the capital is being used as a hub for its extremist activities. Mohammed Morsi, the Brotherhood chief who was elected president of Egypt then deposed last year, is in jail. Following the army-led coup in Egypt, some Brotherhood leaders are reported to have fled to London, and may be co-ordinating their next move from a flat in the north-west suburb of Cricklewood. The Prime Minister is understood to have come under pressure from Egypt and Saudi Arabia to ban the group, but this is unlikely to happen. Last night a spokesman for No 10 said: ‘The Prime Minister has commissioned an internal government review into the philosophy and activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Government’s policy towards the organisation.’ Unrest: Clashes have taken place in Cairo between riot police and those who support the Muslim Brotherhood and ousted President Mohamed Mursi . As part of the review MI6 will look into allegations the group was responsible for the murder of three tourists on a bus in Egypt in February and a series of other recent attacks. The Brotherhood is Egypt’s oldest and largest Islamist organisation and has inspired similar movements around the world with its political activism and charity work. Officials have said it is ‘possible but unlikely’ that the organisation will join the list of groups proscribed because of their links to terrorism. Last month 529 Brotherhood members were sentenced to death by a court in Cairo, as part of a crackdown on the group. Mr Cameron asked Sir John Jenkins, Britain’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, to report on the Brotherhood’s ‘philosophy and values and alleged connections with extremism and violence’ by the end of July. Sir Kim Darroch, the National Security Adviser, has already started work on the report. Egyptian relatives of supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi cry sitting outside the courthouse in the southern province of Minya after 529 Brotherhood members were sentenced to death . Protests: The ruling is an escalation of Egypt's crackdown on supporters of Morsi, who was removed in July . Officials from the Senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office have previously resisted attempts to ban the organisation, arguing that to hinder a body that was largely moderate would only strengthen support of extreme Islamists. The Muslim Brotherhood is Egypt's oldest and most established Islamist group, founded at a time when they wanted to rid the country of British influence. After success members began getting involved in the country's politics but its supporters have been forced underground for most of its . existence since its birth in 1928. The coup to remove Morse last year was, in their view, the latest in a . long line of attempts to eradicate political Islam. They have been further marginalised after the interim Egyptian government declared them a terrorist group and blamed them for a series of deadly attacks in the country. Thousands of members have been arrested, hundreds sentenced to death and the organisations headquarters trashed and burned to the ground. Members have fled - including to Britain. A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood said that it would co-operate with the Downing Street review. ‘It is a religious obligation for any Muslim Brotherhood member who lives whether in his homeland or any state to respect its system and laws,’ he told The Times. Kwasi Kwarteng, a Tory MP and member of the Conservative Middle East Council , said that the West had been blindsided by the group’s sudden emergence. ‘I saw how they won elections in Egypt and essentially they ran Egypt very much in a partisan manner. They are quite loose, so they will say different things at different people at different times to seem moderate. They are great masters of disguise. ‘I think people in the West can get very deluded about the nature of the Brotherhood. Certainly three years ago we thought they were going to be just another political party.’ London became known as Londonistan ten years ago due to the number of Islamic hate preachers in the capital.","Review will look at the 'philosphy and activities' of the Muslim Brotherhood .

"By . John Hall . A Catholic priest in Poland has warned parents that Lego is a 'tool of Satan' that could destroy their child's soul and 'lead them to the dark side'. Father Slawomir Kostrzewa said a new range of figures by the Danish toy company 'were about darkness and the world of death' rather than the 'friendly fellows' the company traditionally produced. The figures Father Kostrzewa referred to during his speech aimed at parents are from Lego's new 'Monster Fighters' and 'Zombie' series - both of which feature ghoulish, ashen-faced characters he claims have more in common with 666 - the number of the beast - than traditional plastic bricks. 'Evil': Father Slawomir Kostrzewa said Lego's new 'Monster Fighters' range is 'about darkness and the world of death' and could destroy the souls of children and 'lead them to the dark side' Describing the Lego characters' change in appearence to wear torn clothes that are covered in blood, Father Kostrzewa said: 'Friendly fellows have been replaced by dark monsters... These toys can have a negative effect on children. They can destroy their souls and lead them to the dark side.' 'Facial expressions may be lead to confusion between good and evil,' he added. Father Kostrzewa went on to cite research by New Zealand's University of Canterbury that Lego characters' faces have become angrier over the years, The Telegraph reported. Saying the facial development proves the toys are becoming increasingly 'evil' Father Kostrzewa added: 'It appears the good suffer in battle and the 'villains' have a face showing satisfaction with their evil deeds.' Lego's 'Monster Fighters' range features a sinister-looking character called Lord Vampyre who wants to 'cloak the world in darkness forever'. Expressions: Father Kostrzewa is unhappy at the changing face of Lego characters. He describes the traditional character (left) as a 'happy fellow', while the modern designs are 'dark monsters' To do this he plans to use a 'moonstone device' that is guarded by his 'manbat' henchmen inside a castle booby trapped with deadly spikes and trapdoors. It is the job of the hero characters - sneering Dr. Rodney Rathbone and stern-faced Jack McHammer - to disable the device without being thrown into the castle's dungeon. Father Kostrzewa's claims that Lego toys are the 'tools of Satan' have been been dismissed by at least one psychologist. Speaking to the Super Express newspaper, Monika Filipowska said: 'These are just blocks. Linking them to Satan is just wrong, and all that will happen is that children will be afraid of them now.' A spokesperson for Lego was not available for comment.","Father Slawomir Kostrzewa criticised Lego's new 'Monster Fighters' range .

"By . Daniel Martin . 'I'm being victimised': Bob Crow says he is under no moral obligation to move out of his council house . Union firebrand Bob Crow has said he has ‘no moral duty’ to move out of his council house – despite earning £145,000 in salary and expenses. The general secretary of the rail union RMT still lives with his family in taxpayer-subsidised social housing even though millions of much more needy people are stuck on  waiting lists. Challenged in a radio interview about his failure to buy his own home, he claimed he was being ‘victimised’ and denied there was any ethical obligation for him to do so. ‘I have no moral duty at all,’ he said. ‘I was born in a council house, as far as I’m concerned I will die in one.’ Mr Crow, 52, spoke on the day that he revealed his union could strike for a whole working week in response to plans by Transport for London to close ticket offices across the Tube network, with the loss of 750 jobs. He appeared on London’s LBC radio sporting a tan just after returning from holiday. Presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer challenged the union boss about why he was still living in a housing association home in North London, when he was on such a high wage. She suggested that if he moved out, the home could be used for a family on a waiting list for social housing who might currently be living in overcrowded accommodation. Mr Crow said that if he did move out into a private home, it would be unfair on his family. ‘Yes I could buy my own place but why don’t you ask the rest of my family who live at home with me whether they should have to move as well?’ he said. ‘Why is it just down to me to buy a house? Why should my family who have lived there for 30 years, with all the friends they’ve got, have to move because of the job I’ve got?’ The RMT leader suggested that if he did move he would be seen as having deserted his working class roots. ‘If I moved out of my house tomorrow the first thing you’d say is Comrade Crow leaves his roots,’ he said. Staying put: Mr Crow, who earns £145,000, said 'I was born in a council house so I will die in one' ‘It’s an absolute nonsense. I’m the only one down my road who pays their rent and I’m being victimised.’ He said it did not say anywhere in the rules that ‘someone who pays their rent every week, doesn’t claim social security’ should have to give up their council home. Mr Crow said the reason behind the shortage of social housing was not because of people like him, but because of Margaret Thatcher’s policy of right to buy, which allowed council housing tenants to buy their own homes. But a ban on councils building their own homes meant that these were never replenished – causing a shortage. He also denied he was the recipient of ‘subsidised rent’, even though his rent will be much less than the market rents for similar properties in his area.","RMT general secretary lives with family in taxpayer-subsidised housing .

"By . Steve Robson . Rare find: The Jawa toy, still in its original packaging from the 1970s, is expected to fetch thousands of pounds at auction . A vintage Star Wars figurine believed to be one of the rarest in the world could fetch up to £12,000 when sold at auction. The British-manufactured 'Jawa' figure was most likely bought for just 99p from a newsagent back in 1978. But Palitoy, a company based in Coalville, Leicester, later lost the licence to sell Star Wars memorabilia and such items rarely surface. In fact, only one other Jawa, complete with vinyl cape and packaged on unpunched card, is known to exist in the world. It sold on eBay earlier this year for £11,300. But now an equally special model is due to go on sale at Thornaby auction house Vectis. The owner wishes to remain anonymous and will not give any information as to how he or she came to own the figure. Valuer Kathy Taylor said: 'This is one of the rarest Star Wars figures that has ever been sold. It is the Holy Grail for Star Wars memorabilia collectors. 'Until the other figure, which was authenticated by the US-based Action Figure Authority, came on the market, people didn’t think the Palitoy-made Jawas with the vinyl capes even existed, so there was a lot of excitement when that was sold. Fan favourite: In the Star Wars films, Jawas are hooded creatures who buy and sell droids . 'They used to be sold in the newsagents for 99p and it started off with just 12 characters, including the Jawa. Later the toys were made in America as Palitoy lost the licence. 'The Star Wars memorabilia market is massive and it’s growing all the time. It’s something a lot of people remember from their childhood and the first toys were very good quality.' She said the figure was expected to fetch between £6,000 and £8,000 - but could attract bids of up to £12,000 or more based on the eBay auction. The Vectis television and film-related auction takes place on October 24 and features four carded Star Wars figures, including the rare Jawa. Jawas are the hooded creatures with glowing eyes who buy and sell droids in the Star Wars films. A band of Jawas are responsible for locating C-3PO and R2-D2 and selling them to Luke Skywalker's uncle, Owen Lars.","Vintage figurine believed to be one of only two in existence .

"By . Fiona Macrae . He solved one of the greatest mysteries in the universe...but last night Peter Higgs was at the centre of one himself. Professor Higgs, the scientist who first predicted the existence of the ‘God particle’, was yesterday awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics, but officials admitted they did not know where he was or if he even knew he had won the award. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences could not raise him on the phone before making the announcement and said he had gone ‘into hiding’. Scroll down for video . Officials admit they don't know where Peter Higgs is... or if he knows he's won the award . Colleagues said the self-effacing 84-year-old, who has not been well lately, had gone hiking in the Scottish Highlands to avoid the ‘storm’ of interest. Alan Walker, a friend and fellow physicist, said: ‘The pressure was so much he decided to go on holiday without a phone to avoid the media storm. 'He’s not available and good for him. He didn’t tell even me.’ In a statement prepared last week, amid anticipation that he would be the 120th Briton to be honoured with a Nobel Prize, Prof Higgs said he was ‘overwhelmed’. The magnet core of the world's largest superconducting solenoid magnet at CERN in Geneva (left). And pictured (right), Peter Higgs, who has won the Nobel Prize for Physics . Born in Newcastle in 1929, the son of a BBC sound engineer, Peter Higgs was a gifted pupil at Bristol’s Cotham Grammar where he won many prizes – although none for physics. He chose to study at King’s College London, after rejecting Oxford and Cambridge as the choice of the ‘idle rich’, and gained a first-class honours degree in 1950. He was a young lecturer at Edinburgh University in 1964 when he dreamed up the particle that would make him famous. Along with two other groups of scientists who were working independently, he came up with an explanation of how the most basic building blocks of the universe gain mass. Mr Higgs shares the prize with Belgium physicist Francois Englert who proposed a similar theory around the same time . The theory states that the cosmos is pervaded by an invisible field that confers mass on particles as they pass through it. Unlike the other scientists of the time, Prof Higgs also forecast the field was made up of countless tiny particles – Higgs bosons, or God particles. The theory was not universally accepted and one of his papers was rejected for publication because it was ‘of no obvious relevance to physics’. But by the 1980s, the hunt for the Higgs boson was on in earnest and last year, almost 50 years after Prof Higgs predicted its existence, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider found it. Prof Higgs shares the £775,000 prize with Belgian scientist Francois Englert, who with colleague Robert Brout proposed a similar theory around the same time. Dr Brout died in 2011 and, under Nobel rules, cannot be honoured. Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘It took nearly 50 years and thousands of great minds to discover the Higgs boson after Prof Higgs proposed it, and he and all those people should be extremely proud.’ Professor Peter Higgs appears to wipe away a tear after scientists at the Large Hadron Collider claimed to have discovered a particle believed to be the Higgs Boson in 2012 . Dr Alex Tapper, of Imperial College London, said: ‘Nobody can be more deserving of the prize than the visionaries who waited 50 years to discover if their ideas were right or wrong.’ Professor Paul Newman, of the University of Birmingham, added: ‘The audacity of proposing such a bizarre and all-pervading mechanism based on what was known half a century ago is simply stunning.’ But Nobel rules state the prize can be shared between only three people. Tom Kibble, of Imperial College London, a member of the team that was overlooked, congratulated the winners but questioned why the Nobel committee was ‘constrained by a self-imposed rule’.","Professor Peter Higgs cannot be found after winning prestigious prize .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 05:04 EST, 15 November 2011 . Warning: German Chancellor Angela Merkel today said Europe could be living through its 'toughest hour since World War Two' German Chancellor Angela Merkel today said Europe could be living through its 'toughest hour since World War Two' - as new leaders in Italy and Greece rushed to form governments to limit the damage from the eurozone debt crisis, and fears grew that Spain could now be at risk of a bailout. Merkel told her conservative party in Leipzig: 'Europe is in one of its toughest, perhaps the toughest hour since World War II. She also said she feared Europe would fail if the euro failed, and vowed to do 'anything' to stop this from happening. But in a one-hour address to the Christian Democrats (CDU), she offered no new ideas for resolving the crisis that has forced bailouts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, and has raised fears about the survival of the 17-state currency zone. She said: 'If the euro fails then Europe fails, and we want to prevent and we will prevent this, this is what we are working for, because it is such a huge historical project.' Merkel's warning came as Italy's Prime Minister-elect started talks today to create a new government of non-political experts. Mario Monti, dubbed Super Mario, set about creating his cabinet - which is tasked with overhauling an ailing economy to keep market fears over the country from threatening the existence of the euro. In a vote of confidence in his ability to quickly form a new government, Italy's borrowing rates on the secondary bond market sank. There was added respite for the euro after the Italian Treasury paid a record 6.29 per cent yield to . sell five-year government bonds in the first auction held since Monti . was asked to head an emergency government. In with the new: Mario Monti (left) and Lucas . Papademos (right) are the new Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece, and . their appointments have led to the calming of markets . But financial markets dipped slightly today, despite fresh hopes that Europe is making 'significant' progress in tackling its debt crisis. The FTSE 100 closed 0.38 per cent down at 5,524.49; Germany's DAX ended . 1.00 per cent down at 5,996.25; and France's CAC 40 finished trading 1.20 per . cent down at 3,111.53. Asia's markets had earlier been boosted . by the developments - the Hang Seng Index finished 1.94 per cent up at . 19,508.18; China Enterprises Index ended the day 2.75 per cent up at . 10,716.9; and the Shanghai Composite Index closed 1.92 per cent up at . 2,528.71. The markets have also been hit, slightly, . by the news that Spain and France could be the next eurozone countries to fall into . economic chaos - and that former Italian Prime Minister Silvio . Berlusconi is considering standing for office again. The appointment of a new Prime Minister in Greece, which needed to form a new government to pass stringent economic reforms in order to receive the next instalment of its €110billion bailout . loan, was seen positively by the markets. Former European Central Bank vice president Lucas Papademos - who oversaw Greece's entry to the eurozone in 2002 - will meet with his new cabinet on Wednesday before meeting with eurozone finance ministers on Thursday to negotiate the payment of the next instalment of the country's bailout deal. He takes over from George Papandreou. And the appointment of a successor to Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, which last week came perilously close to defaulting on paying interest on its 1.9 trillion euro debt, also had a positive effect on markets, despite Berlusconi saying he would consider standing for office again once the crisis has passed. The president of the eurozone's third largest economy, Giorgio Napolitano, yesterday asked former European Commissioner Mario Monti to form a government. He faces fears that the country will . need a Greek style bailout which Europe cannot afford as it is simply . too big. The cost of Rome’s borrowing shocked markets last week as the . interest rate it was being asked to pay soared at one stage to almost . 7.5 per cent on a ten-year bond. It now stands as 6.54 per cent. Italy held a bond auction today seeking to raise up to three billion . euros (£2.6 billion). It has been deemed a 'success' because of decent demand. Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin . Dolphin, welcomed the change in leaders and said: 'We have now got two . strong characters who are prepared to put public interest ahead of . personal interest. 'They have a lot of goodwill to start with. The challenge for them now is to implement the fiscal austerity and budget reforms. Out with the old: Silvio Berlusconi (left) and George Papandreou (right) have stepped down as the leaders of Italy and Greece . 'The important thing for them is to . attempt to re-establish credibility as quickly as possible. The first . test of this will be the reception of the bond auction in Italy.' This . week also sees Spain – regarded as another weak link in the eurozone - . looking to raise about four billion euros with an issue of ten-year . bonds. Borrowing on its bonds today rose to 6.04 per cent, and prompted fears it could also soon pass the critical 7 per cent level which forced bailout in the three other eurozone countries. France is expected to raise as much as ten billion euros in long and short-term debts. France, . regarded alongside Germany as a core member of the eurozone, was also . drawn into the debt maelstrom last week when the yield on its bonds rose . sharply. British chancellor George Osborne . warned last night that France is being drawn into the same economic . chaos as Italy. He made it clear the crisis will not be over until France . too has answered doubts about its debts and the rising costs of . borrowing on the markets which effectively ended Berlusconi’s . premiership in Italy. Warning: British chancellor George Osborne . (left) has warned French President Nicolas Sarkozy (right) that France . could be drawn into the same economic chaos as Italy . The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has the support of three in four of his countrymen, according to opinion polls. But he was facing his first protest . in front of parliament this afternoon from left-wing demonstrators who . accuse the new government of working in the interests of . bankers. Inspectors from the ""troika"", the . International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Union, . started arriving in Athens today, piling pressure on Greece to qualify . for a second bailout worth 130 billion euros and an 8 billion euro . tranche from the earlier bailout, needed to finance bond payments due at . the end of the year. Greece said on Monday it had raised . 380 million euros from the sale of mobile telephone frequencies to its . three main cell phone operators. The sale forms part of the country's plan to sell 50 billion euros of state assets over the coming years to repay its debt. But in a sign of problems faced by . the Athens government, German construction group Hochtief revealed it . may have to take a financial hit on the value of its road contracts in . Greece due to mass toll dodging by Greek motorists. In a . warning to French president Nicolas Sarkozy, Osborne said ‘the immediate . crisis in hand’ was ‘dealing with the lack of confidence in Italy’ and . ‘dealing with the questions that have been raised over countries like . France’. ‘That is where all our efforts have been . focused on at the moment,’ he said. ‘We’re not any more just talking . about countries like Greece. 'We’re talking about big countries like . Italy and France . . . having to take very, very difficult decisions.’ Contrasting the success of Britain in . reassuring the markets that the Government is serious about tackling . the UK’s huge debts, the Chancellor pointed out: ‘France has had two . emergency budgets in the last three months.’ Arguing . that Britain is better prepared for the storm, he told the BBC Politics . Show he was not ‘a eurozone finance minister who is terrified he can’t . sell his country’s debt tomorrow’. Berlin . plans to issue about six billion euros worth of bonds this week. Alongside Britain it has one of Europe’s lowest costs of borrowing. The . total of 21.5 billion euros being raised is not an usually high sum, . but it is far higher than the six billion euros raised by eurozone . countries last week and comes at a critical moment for the nations in . the single-currency bloc.

"Two men face charges of raping and murdering a four-year-old girl in the town of Mandi Dabwali in Sirsa, India, while under the influence of drugs. The alleged crime is the latest in a series of rape cases that has seen the nation undergo debate, self-scrutiny and mass protests calling for greater punishments for rapists and more measures to increase the safety of women. Officers say the two men, identified by the aliases 'Chhiller' and 'Vikki', were on intoxicant capsules bought from a chemist at the time of the crime. A four-year-old has been raped and murdered in a town in Sirsa province. It is the latest case of rape in a country undergoing public rage over offences against women. Pictured: Indian demonstrators shout slogans during a protest calling for better safety for women following the rape of a student last month . Dabwali city Station House Officer Ravi Kumar said: 'The statement they (the accused) gave us is very disturbing. 'Pawan, alias Chhiller, and Vikas, alias Vikki, are friends and were the victim's neighbours. 'They consumed some intoxicant capsules from a medical shop on January 26. They watched two minor girls play outside their house on their way back. 'Vikki decided to kidnap the girl, and then took her to a secluded place near a pond where Chhiller was waiting. They first tried unnatural sex and then raped the girl. 'A postmortem of the girl revealed that when she regained consciousness, they threw her in the pond and she drowned,' he added. The police struggled for several hours to find her body and used divers to scour the pond. She was cremated on Monday. The rape and murder took place in the town of Mandi Dabwali in Sirsa, India . An elderly protester shouts slogans during a protest demanding the death penalty for six men accused of a fatal gang rape of a young woman in New Delhi last month . Senior Superintendent of Police Rajshri Singh went to the crematorium and assured villagers of strict action against the accused, The Times of India reported. The intense debate surrounding rape in India was sparked when allegations emerged that a 17-year-old and five men gang-raped and severely beat a female student on a moving bus in the capital before dumping her and a male friend in the road. The woman was so badly injured that she died of massive organ failure in a Singapore hospital two weeks later. The outcry was so strong that President Pranab Mukherjee made an unusual call in a television state-of-the nation address on Friday for the country to 'reset its moral compass'. Despite the mass public outcry over the rape, many Indians feel little has changed as a result, especially as a number of high-profile rape cases such as this have occurred in the month since the student died. Indian columnist Sunanda Vashisht wrote: 'The sheer brutality of the incident jolted every Indian out of stupor. There was lot to be ashamed about. 'The unspeakable tragedy of a young woman training to be physiotherapist had actually succeeding in waking us all up. Rage: Students try to break through a police cordon during a protest over the New Delhi rape . 'Men and women, old and young, stood at India Gate braving water cannons, asking for better security, tougher laws and stringent punishments for offenders. It was truly a proud moment to see something positive coming out of the tragedy. 'However, the silver lining only lasted so long. She added: 'No heads have rolled, no one has claimed responsibility for the bus with suspended permits and illegal tinted windows on the roads. 'No one has claimed responsibility for the deteriorating law and order in Delhi, the argument being this was not the first case of violence against women in the national capital. 'In short, those who were responsible for the ghastly incident were slowly and surely made to slide off the headlines.'","The two men were alleged to have been high on drugs .

"By . Suzannah Hills . A man has been rescued after attempting to sail from Dorset to Ireland in a 6ft inflatable dinghy with a makeshift sail, Coastguards have revealed. The amateur sailor, believed to be a 40-year-old American, tied a plastic sheet to one of the flimsy plastic paddles to act as a sail, while using the other paddle as a rudder. Coastguard officials said he could have died and was lucky to have been found when he was. The moment of rescue: The crew of a dive boat had to rescue an amateur sailor off the coast of Dorset after he attempted to sail to Ireland in a 6ft rubber dinghy . Captain calamity: The man, believed to be a 40-year-old America, used one plastic paddle and a sheet as a makeshift sail and another paddle as his rudder . The unnamed man had set off from Osmington Mills in Dorset at 9am and had a limited amount of food and drink for the journey. Portland Coastguard received a call just after 3pm yesterday from a range safety craft reporting concern for the man, who was approximately 2.7 nautical miles south of Durdle Door, just five miles along the coast from where he began his journey. The spokesman said: 'The man was heading . for Ireland in a 6ft beach blow-up dinghy. With him were two paddles, . one used as a mast accompanied by a plastic sheet as a sail, and the . other used as a rudder to steer. Aboard was a limited amount of food and . drink.' Coastguard officials then put out a broadcast requesting further information about the dinghy. Ahoy there! The madcap mariner had set off in his unsuitable craft from Osmington beach near Weymouth to attempt a 35 mile voyage to Bournemouth . Coastguard officials said he could have died and was lucky to have been found when he was . A dive vessel responded with a sighting, provided a position and then approached the dinghy to assess the situation but the man told them he was ok and did not need any help. But after finishing their diving operations, the dive vessel returned to the scene and rescued the man before taking him into Lulworth Cove. He was met there at 8.30pm by the Lulworth Coastguard rescue team, police and ambulance and received treatment for a high degree of sunburn. John Braisher, watch officer at Portland Coastguard, said: 'This man was extremely lucky to be found when he was. 'With no suitable communications equipment, limited life saving equipment and inadequate food and drink resources for his passage to Ireland, the outcome could have been very different. 'If youâ€™re planning to head out to sea, the key is to be well prepared. Inflatable dinghies, such as this, are unsuitable and not recommended for coastal passages of this nature. 'Itâ€™s also vital to have appropriate VHF/DSC communications, life saving equipment and the resources to sustain a venture such as this person intended. 'HM Coastguard is always willing to discuss and provide advice on passage plans you may have.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hundreds of Google interns have flooded a San Francisco Bay Area apartment complex and the full-time residents say their partying and late hours have gotten out of control. The much sought after internships afford the lucky college students salaries of upwards of $6,000 per month and, apparently, also afford the free time needed to throw a raucous party. Meanwhile, the children and families who already called Crescent Village apartments in North San Jose home are wishing these twenty-somethings would go back to where they came from. Surprise! Last month, at least 400 Google interns were moved into North San Jose, California's posh Crescent Village apartments, much tot he chagrin of full-time residents . Party time: Residents say the interns like these, who are paid a whopping $6,000 per month over the summer, began partying in communal areas like the pool and courtyards of the 1,750-unit complex almost immediately . Until this year, reports New York Magazine, Google did something more typical for its fresh-faced interns: the company offered them a living stipend and told them to find a place of their own. But not this year. This year, the tech giant put its summer interns up in the high-end complex of some 1,700 apartments, which rent for upwards of $3,375 per month. There are swimming pools, tennis courts, a fitness center, basketball court, and even a wine room and full-time activities director. A Facebook page called Crescent Village Google Interns has nearly 400 members. Though the page was up early Monday, as of around noon it had been taken down or suspended. The intern pictures represented here were found through the group page before it was taken down but are not necessarily the students to blame for Crescent Village complaints. A Yelp review calling it a ‘pretty bad’ situation said parties happen all week long and that security at Crescent Village has been powerless to stop it. Pricey: Aside from the lucky interns, Crescent Village houses families and commuting Silicon Valley professionals in apartments that run as much as $3,375 per month. The interns stay for free. All inclusive: The interns also dine, travel, and participate in group leisure activities for free . Last month, a list of rules and reminders were distributed throughout the complex. Among them was a request to ‘honor the “quiet enjoyment” of your neighbors.’ Another reminded tenants of the pool hours of 10 to 8. What’s worse, the residents weren’t told all those students were coming. ‘At first I thought it was summer camp,’ resident Rochelle Fisher, 46, told NY Mag. ‘But then I noticed that the kids were too old.’ Photos like these dot the Facebook accounts of the prestigious interns, many of them grouped on an official Crescent Village Google Interns page . Fisher said the interns don’t bother her as much because she’s on the top floor, but that neighbors have complained about crazy behavior from the temporary residents. And outside her apartment, Fisher said the interns have, at times, been a nuisance. ‘They dart out into the middle of the street,’ Fisher said. ‘They jaywalk all the time. I have to be very careful when I'm driving.’ The internship also reportedly includes free transportation, food, and other unbelievable amenities. It’s almost as if the recent Owen Wilson/Vince Vaughn comedy comes to life when the students arrive at Mountain View. To blame? One neighbor in the North San Jose complex took to Yelp, 'the situation is pretty bad' and said the loud partying occurs throughout the week in communal areas such as the one pictured . Yes or no? A comedy about just how posh the Google intern positions are was coincidentally released last month and stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn . Rainbow-colored glasses: The film seems to have drawn at least some of its inspiration from reality . In fact, The Internship is about two men who land the dream position at Google. One less lucky intern, who is working at Yahoo! for the summer, has nonetheless been lucky enough to befriend a Google intern. ‘It's pretty fun,’ he said of Crescent Village, calling the parties held four or five times a week ‘sort of normal college parties. 'One temporary issue': One Yelp reviewer of Crescent Village (pictured) bemoaned the annoying summer-long stay of the highly-paid students, but admitted it was, at least, temporary . ‘You put a bunch of 20-year-olds in the same place, and what do you expect,’ he said. Thankfully for the annoyed residents, they expect the invasion to end rather soon. ‘It's like a dorm now,’ wrote another Yelp user who rated the complex highly and called the interns a ‘temporary issue.’ ‘I could hear a lot of noise, people talking and singing even in the middle of the night. The sound-proof is pretty good if I close the windows, but it's summer time, I want some fresh and cool air.’ Shutdown: After reports emerged Monday of the interns' behavior, someone quickly suspended a Facebook page dedicated to Crescent Village Google Interns (screen shot pictured here)","'I thought it was summer camp': Around 400 interns moved into the Crescent Village Apartments in North San Jose last month and residents weren't warned .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Killer: Carl Mills, 28, who was today found guilty of the murders of a whole family, who all died when a fire he started ripped through their home . A violent alcoholic who killed three . generations of a family – including his own baby – in a jealous rage was . jailed for at least 30 years yesterday. Carl Mills set fire to a house, trapping his girlfriend Kayleigh Buckley, her daughter Kimberley and Miss Buckley’s mother Kim. Mills, 28, started the blaze because he was convinced Miss Buckley, 17, had another man in her bedroom. But the only people in the house were . family celebrating six-month-old Kimberley being allowed home from . hospital for the first time. She was deaf and blind, having  been . born 13 weeks premature weighing 1lb 9oz. Her twin, Angel, who weighed . only 15oz, had died two days after being born. Mills, who had been banned from the . home in Coed Eva, Cwmbran, South Wales, after making repeated threats to . kill Miss Buckley and the baby, set fire to a recycling bin in the . porch. The smoke and flames spread quickly . and prosecutor Gregory Bull told Newport Crown Court: ‘The three victims . didn’t have a chance. ‘They couldn’t get down the stairs because the fire was set deliberately by the front door.’ Neighbours saw Miss Buckley banging on . the windows and screaming for help but they were beaten back by the . flames as they tried in vain to save her, her 46-year-old mother and . the baby. Mills, who yawned in court as a statement by Miss Buckley’s . family was read out, was jailed for life after being found guilty of . three counts of murder. Judge Wyn Williams ordered that Mills, . whom he described as ‘despicable’, should serve a minimum  of 30 years, . telling him: ‘There is  no saying whether you will ever  be released. ‘You must have known that once the . fire had taken hold that there would be virtually no chance of escape. 'You condemned Kim and Kayleigh to an agonising death. You have shown no . remorse.’ Tragedy: Mills' girlfriend Kayleigh Buckley, 17, died alongside her mother Kim Buckley (right) after their home in South Wales was set on fire . Callous: His own daughter Kimberley Buckley was only six-months-old when she died after a fire swept through the property . Mills, who was unemployed and had been living in a tent outside the house, had denied murder. He claimed he was in a pub at the time the fire was started in September last year. But a series of aggressive and abusive . texts Mills had sent Miss Buckley the night before, threatening to . torch the family home, were read to the jury, and he was seen outside . the house displaying ‘a callous, almost casual disregard’ as the inferno . took hold. Mr Bull said: ‘Neighbours were shocked . by how calm he appeared to be. He showed no emotion and did not attempt . to rescue his daughter or the woman he claimed to love. It was the . actions of a cold-hearted killer who knew exactly what he was doing. ‘He had carried out the threat he had made hours earlier.’ Calculated: The court heard Mills started the fire in the porchway of the three-bed house, blocking the exit . Horrifying: Gwent Police pictures show the black, charred inside pf the fire damaged house in Cwmbran shortly after the arson attack . Light pours through where the roof used to be before it was destroyed in the fire that killed the three victims . Home: The tent Mills had lived in in the front garden of the house he torched. He had also been banned from seeing his child Kimberley unsupervised . Mills met Miss Buckley on the internet when she was 15. He was living in Manchester and travelled to South Wales to meet her. He deliberately set out to groom her . and their relationship developed into a sexual one. But he became . obsessively jealous of Miss Buckley, over whom he seemed to exercise a . ‘magnetic control’, the court was told. She became pregnant with the twins, born in March last year. Mr Bull said: ‘Kayleigh started acting . as a mother. Mills didn’t want Kayleigh to spend more time with the . baby. He wanted Kayleigh to be with him and him alone. He become . convinced she was having an affair.’ This, he said, led to the tragedy. Shameful: The murderer was motionless in the dock as he was found guilty and sat with his head bowed as the judge jailed him . The court heard Mills (left) started the fire after he became convinced Kayleigh (right) had another man in her bedroom . The court heard the only people in the house . were grandmother Kim (left, with granddaughter Kimberley), Kayleigh and . the six-month-old baby, who had just returned from hospital after being . born prematurely . Prosecutor Greg Bull said Mills became 'obsessively jealous of Kayleigh' after they met on the internet . The jury was told that Mills wouldn't leave Kayleigh (pictured) alone and was sleeping in a tent in front of the family home . In a . statement to the court,  Mrs Buckley’s mother Gwyneth Swain, 64, said: . ‘The heart has been ripped out of our family by the senseless actions of . Carl Mills. There’s a hole in my life that no one will ever fill. ‘I’m so lost without them and I cannot . truly express this. Like her mum, Kayleigh always had a smile on her . face, she loved her family and we all loved her. ‘Baby Kimberley battled so much. But the fire that night was a battle too far.’ Family and friends burst into applause as Mills was taken away to begin his sentence. They released three white doves and . balloons on the steps of the court in memory of the three victims. In a . statement afterwards, the family said: ‘Today we feel justice has been . served.’ Underweight, shifty and with a diffident demeanour Carl Mills was about as far from appearing intimidating in court as possible. His threatening texts promising violence and murder to teenager Kayleigh (together right) showed him to be a bully and a coward. In court he appeared slightly built and pale-faced and above all eager to avoid eye contact with his murder trial jury. Chronically soft-spoken he mumbled his way through his evidence and was frequently incomprehensible. Despite electing to stand when he gave evidence Mills lent forward and bent his knees in such a way he almost appeared to be sitting. As a result his face frequently fell below a small flat screen TV in the witness box, making it difficult for the jury to see him. The combination of his stance and almost whispered evidence led his own defence barrister to berate him for failing to speak up. 'You are on trial for three counts of murder. This is your chance to give your story. Now please buck up,' Patrick Harrington QC told him in court. In all Mills appeared a pathetic and forlorn figure, a stark contrast to the brutish language used in his chilling text messages. In many ways, however, he also represents the embodiment of every parent’s worst nightmare.","Carl Mills, 28, was jailed for life at Newport Crown Court today .

"By . Alex Greig . Three former NFL players have been diagnosed with having signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), including former Dallas Cowboys great and football Hall of Famer Tony Dorsett, 59. Up until recently, the only way to diagnose CTE was by studying brain tissue after death, but a UCLA research team has pioneered a brain-imaging technique that identifies a build-up of abnormal proteins called tau in the brain. The other players diagnosed were . Hall of Fame offensive lineman Joe DeLamielleure, 62, and former All-Pro . defensive lineman Leonard Marshall, 52. One other unidentified player was . also tested but his results are not yet known. Recently diagnosed: Tony Dorsett has undergone three months of testing that confirmed the presence in his brain of a kind of protein linked to a degenerative disorder . Legendary player: Tony Dorsett pictured in 1988, the last of his 12 years of  playing professional NFL . The presence of tau in the amygdala and subcortical regions of the brain is believed to be triggered by trauma from repeated blows to the head. These regions control learning, memory, behavior, emotions, and other mental and physical functions. The players underwent three months of testing. Five other players were tested last year; all were confirmed to have signs of CTE. Former athlete: Since Tony Dorsett (center, in number 33 jersey) ended his professional playing career he has experienced a range of symptoms from depression to memory loss . The condition is found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma such as boxers, and is increasingly being associated with NFL players. A build-up of tau protein in the brain strangles brain cells and causes the brain to degenerate, resulting in memory loss, confusion, impaired judgement, impulse control problems, aggression, depression and progressive dementia. Dorsett played 12 years in the NFL, 11 of those for the Dallas Cowboys and recorded 12,739 rushing yards and 77 touchdowns. He told ESPN's Outside the Lines that . he has suffered memory loss, getting lost while driving his young . daughters places he's been going every week for years. He experiences mood swings, lashing out at his family uncharacteristically. 'It's painful, man, for my daughters to say they're scared of me.' After a long pause, he tearfully reiterated, 'It's painful.' Dorsett has also been diagnosed with depression and had suicidal thoughts. As of December last year, 33 NFL players have been diagnosed with CTE postmortem, among them at least four of them died by suicide. 'My quality of living has changed drastically and it deteriorates every day,' said Dorsett. 'I've thought about crazy stuff, sort of . like, ""Why do I need to continue going through this?""' he said. 'I'm . too smart of a person, I like to think, to take my life, but it's . crossed my mind.' Brain trauma: Leonard Marshall (left) and Joe DeLamielleure have both been diagnosed with signs of CTE . DeLamielleure, 62, told Outside the Lines that he's sure his condition was caused by his football career. 'I can guarantee you my CTE, my tau, came from hits, came from blows to the head,' he said. He suffers anxiety, insomnia, mood swings and has had suicidal thoughts. During his 13-year career playing for Buffalo and Cleveland, he was never diagnosed with a concussion but estimates he had at least 100 concussions out of thousands of blows to the head during games and practice. The NFL has repeatedly denied there is enough evidence to conclude there is a link between football and CTE, but in light of recent diagnoses has shifted its position on head injuries, introducing rule changes and promoting education. 'I knew something was going on. It takes me back to the fact that we [as players] were treated [after head injuries] and still put back out there in harm’s way, when from my understanding management knew what they were doing to us. Abnormal protein: This slide from UCLA shows the build-up of tau protein (in red) in two former NFL players' brains . 'They were still subjecting us to that kind of physical abuse without the proper treatment. It really hurts... But I'm determined to beat this,' Dorsett told the Dallas News. In January, Dr. Richard Ellenbogen, a Seattle neurosurgeon and co-chair of the NFL's Head, Neck and Spine Committee, told Outside the Lines that the UCLA CTE study was 'promising work,' adding the researchers were 'honest about the limitations as well as being excited about the findings.' Dorsett, Marshall and DeLamielleure are among the more than 4,500 plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit filed against the NFL, which argued that for years the NFL had concealed a link between football and brain damage. In August, they settled for $765 million but as part of the settlement, the NFL did not admit to any wrongdoing. Neurosurgeon Julian Bailes, part of the UCLA research team told ESPN, 'Until we had the ability to see it in a living, breathing person, we had no chance of helping them, we had no chance of really understanding what happens to the disease. It gives us the ability to track it, to see if it gets worse, or hopefully, maybe it gets better with medication, with intervention, with new discoveries.' Dorsett is hopeful about the future now that he has received a diagnosis for his troubling symptoms . 'I'm trying to slow this down or cut it off,' he said. 'I'm going to be 60 years old here next year, so I'm hoping that I've got another good 30 years or so.'","Former Dallas Cowboys great Tony Dorsett has been diagnosed with having signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)

"By . Jenny Hope . Problems: Medication containing statins for treating people with high cholesterol can create muscle pain and joint diseases . Taking statins makes you more likely to be diagnosed with muscle pain, joint diseases and injuries, researchers have warned. They found a 20 per cent increased risk of muscle problems in those on the cholesterol-lowering drugs compared with those not taking them. The US team says the risk may be relatively small but it is important because millions of older patients with heart conditions take statins and their use may eventually widen to include healthy younger people. Statins are the most widely prescribed drugs in Britain. The number of patients taking them is estimated at 5million to 8million. But there have been persistent complaints about side effects such as muscle pain and weakness. The most serious adverse reaction is myopathy in about one in 1,000 users, resulting in muscle pain, tenderness and weakness. This condition can progress to rhabdomyolysis, a complete breakdown of muscle cells that can lead to kidney failure and death. In some patients muscle weakness may persist even after stopping the drugs. And a British Heart Foundation survey found that one in three patients prescribed the drugs doesn’t take them, partly because of side effects. The latest study investigated the scale of illnesses linked to statins, including muscle weakness, muscle cramps and tendon diseases. Dr Ishak Mansi, of the Veterans Association North Texas Health Care System in Dallas, and colleagues used data from the US military health care system. Complaints: Manufacturers do warn that side effects include muscle pain and weakness, memory loss and sleep disturbances . Patients were divided into two groups: 6,967 who used statins for at least 90 days in 2005, and 6,967 non-users, says a report published online by JAMA Internal Medicine. Statin patients were almost 20 per cent more likely than non-users to have a diagnosis of a musculo-skeletal disease, a 13 per cent higher risk of a dislocation, strain or sprain, and slightly higher risk of muscle pain. They were no more at risk of joint diseases such as osteoarthritis than non-users. The report said: ‘To our knowledge, this is the first study to show statin use is associated with an increased likelihood of diagnoses of musculoskeletal conditions, joint diseases and injuries.’ There have been growing calls for healthy over-50s to take statins, not just those at extra risk of a heart attack. But the researchers say any significant effect on general health, however small, should be carefully considered. ‘These findings are concerning because starting statin therapy at a young age for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases has been widely advocated,’ they say. Manufacturers’ warnings about side effects include muscle pain and weakness, memory loss, fatigue, sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction and depression. There is also a higher risk of developing diabetes. British experts said the study showed a very small impact of statins, increasing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders overall from 85 per cent in those not on statins to 87 per cent on a statin. Helen Williams of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said she feared patients might stop taking the drugs. Risk: Statin patients are 13 per cent more likely to suffer dislocations, strains or sprains . She said: ‘In the UK we have around five million people taking statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes. If 1 per cent of these patients stop taking their statins due to concerns about muscle pains we will see at least 2,000 more heart attacks and strokes over the next ten years as a result, but avoid only 1,000 musculoskeletal problems. ‘Patients should be reassured that musculoskeletal disorders occur commonly but they are rarely due to taking statins.’ Dr Tim Chico, of the University of Sheffield/Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, said: ‘Statins save lives when used in the right type of patient, generally those at higher risk of stroke or heart attack because of other medical problems. ‘With statins the benefits are hidden; many people were going to have a heart attack today that was prevented by their statins, but they will never know. The side effects of statins are often all too obvious, and this biases many people against a potentially life-saving tablet.’","Statins are the most widely prescribed drugs in Britain .

"By . Toby Harnden . President Barack Obama appears to be clinging to wafer-thin leads in most swing states, but Mitt Romney's decision to pull staffers out of North Carolina is a sign of his campaign's increasing confidence. Romney is now ahead in most Florida polls and ahead or level in Virginia, as Obama appears to be just leading in Ohio. The Republican nominee needs at least two of these states to win while three would probably guarantee 270 electoral college votes and victory. Lead: Romney, seen exchanging pleasantries with Obama during this week's debate, is pulling his staff out of North Carolina - an indication that he expects to win there . Obama won North Carolina, traditionally a Republican state, very narrowly in 2008. The Democratic convention was held there in part to bolster his standing in the state. The Charlotte News & Observer reported that Romney spokesman Robert Reid was one of the staff moving. 'With the increasingly widening polls in North Carolina, we will continue to allocate resources, including key senior staff, to other states,' Michael Levoff, another Romney spokesman, told the paper. Favourability: Latest poll numbers show Romney leading Obama in key states like North Carolina and Florida . But Romneyâ€™s campaign is still spending on ads in North Carolina, and the campaign did not say how many staffers are actually being moved. Romney is up by 5.6 per cent in North Carolina in the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average. The National Journal has reported that Obamaâ€™s campaign, worried about North Carolina, Virginia  and Florida, is 'circling the wagons around Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire  and Nevada.' Romney is up 2.5 per cent in Florida in the RCP average and tied in Virginia, though each of the last three polls there have given him a narrow edge. All smiles: Ann Romney stands while President Obama and Mitt Romney shake hands during the 67th annual Al Smith dinner at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York on Thursday night . Obama is up 2.5 per cent in the RCP average in Ohio, a considerable tightening since the first presidential debate more than a fortnight ago, when Romney dominated . Two new polls from Public Policy Polling show a much tighter race in Iowa and New Hampshire, with Romney holding a 1-point lead - 49  per cent to 48 per cent - over Obama in both. Previous PPP surveys showed Obama up four points in Iowa and up six points in New Hampshire. Laughing all the way to the White House: Obama and Romney share a joke with New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan during the annual Al Smith dinner which has been attended by presidents since World War II . The candidates are now tied nationally at 47 per cent, according to the RCP average, which estimated Obama has a statistically insignificant 0.1 per cent national lead. To underline the fluid picture, a Republican poll in Pennsylvania - a state Romney had all but conceded - put their candidate four points ahead. That prompted the scheduling of a rally by Representative Paul Ryan, Romney's vice-presidential running mate, in Pittsburgh.","Romney pulls staff out of North Carolina in confidence he'll win the state .

"By . Louise Boyle . A father accused of killing his infant daughter is facing an important hearing to determine if there’s enough evidence to send the case to trial. Sean Phillips, 23, from northern Michigan, is charged with murder in the disappearance of four-month-old Katherine Phillips, who is known as 'Baby Kate'. She hasn’t been seen since 2011. The court hearing starts on Thursday in Ludington, about 80 miles northwest of Grand Rapids, and is expected to last for two days. Sean Phillips (pictured in a 2012 mugshot) has been charged with killing . his infant daughter, baby Kate (right), who disappeared in 2011 . Phillips has been in prison since 2012 . for a crime related to the case. He was sentenced to 10 years behind . bars for unlawful imprisonment for failing to return the child to her . mother. Investigators have . tried to find a body by examining seeds and other plant material on . Phillips’ shoes. There have been extensive searches in Mason County. Baby Katherine was four-and-a-half months old when last seen June 29, 2011, in the Ludington area, about 80 miles northwest of Grand Rapids. Prosecutors said previously that Phillips took the baby from her mother because he feared a court-ordered paternity test would show he was the father. Baby Kate's mother Ariel Courtland testified last year that she last saw her daughter in a car seat in the back of Phillips' vehicle. Precious: Baby Kate was 4-and-a-half months old when last seen June 29, 2011, in the Ludington area, about 80 miles northwest of Grand Rapids, Michigan . Baby Kate's mother Ariel Courtland (right), testified last year that she last saw her daughter in a car seat inside Phillips' vehicle . Police found Phillips about three hours after Ms Courtland reported her daughter's disappearance. Officers found an empty car seat and diaper bag in the trunk and found the infant’s balled-up, inside-out clothing in his pocket. Investigators have said that seeds and other material on Phillips' shoes could be crucial to locating a body. Mason County Prosecutor Paul Spaniola said that since Phillips' conviction on the related charge, detectives have spent ‘countless hours’ on the case. ‘This continuing investigation has included review of biological evidence, site visits, and the enlistment of experts from all over the world who are preeminent in their fields,’ Mr Spaniola said. In July 2012, Phillips wrote a shocking letter from behind bars to Baby Kate's mother, confessing to killing the child in a fit of rage and then dumping her body in the middle of nowhere. Kate Phillips - known in the area as Baby Kate - disappeared on July 29, 2011, and Phillips was arrested the same day. In his letter published last September, the convict wrote how he ripped the child's car seat from the vehicle without realizing she was sitting in it, fatally injuring Baby Kate as she is thrown to the ground. The open murder charge means a jury can consider both first- and second-degree murder.","Sean Phillips, 23, from .

"By . James  Nye . [captio . The 16-year-old Nebraksa Catholic High School student wanted for a brutal hammer and knife attack on another female student was apprehended this morning over 200 miles away from her home after 24-hours on the run. Sarah Piccolo was found alone on U.S. 75, suffering car trouble in Woodson County, Kansas, and was taken to a juvenile detention center where she was charged with First Degree Assault and Use of a Weapon to Commit a Felony for Monday's attack on 17-year-old Ellen Kopetsky. Police in Kansas said that Piccolo will be transported back to Lincoln, Nebraska where authorities have decided she will be tried as an adult after the alleged disturbing attack on Kopetsky yesterday in the bathrooms of Pius X Catholic High School. Kopetzky was hit two times in the head with a claw hammer and cut around her mouth and chin, and on her hands, Lincoln Police Officer Katie Flood said on Tuesday morning to The Beatrice Daily Sun. Police said Piccolo had no relationship with Kopetzky, leaving friends and family to wonder how what the motive for the attack was. In the affidavit for the arrest of Piccolo, Lincoln Police Officer Joseph Yinrick said that Kopetsky had spent the morning in the guidance counselor's office and then walked across the hall to the bathroom at about 9.45 a.m. on Monday morning.

Injured: Lincoln police said that Pius X student Sarah Piccolo attacked 17-year-old Ellen Kopetzky (center) in the bathroom of the Catholic high school on Monday morning . Kopetsky said that when she walked in she was immediately attacked by a girl wielding a knife and what she thought was a large stick. 'The victim said her attacker was swinging wildly at her with the knife and stick and did not say a word to her,' said Kopetsky in the affidavit. Police later found a hunting-style knife with an 8-inch serrated blade and a hammer in the bathroom, but Piccolo had fled the scene in a grey 1992 Buick Park Avenue with Nebraska plate number. Kopetsky underwent surgery to her wounds yesterday but was allowed home from Bryan West hospital today. 'Our family is happy to report that our daughter Ellen has returned home to continue her recovery,' her parents said in a statement. 'We're overwhelmed by the kindness of our community in this difficult moment.' Scene: Pius X High School Catholic High School in Lincoln, Nebraska is where Sarah Piccolo is alleged to have slashed and beaten another female student with a hammer today . In a statement released late Monday, the Kopetzky family asked that Piccolo be treated with “respect and mercy.” 'We ask that you join us in prayer for Sarah Piccolo and her family,' the statement said. Kopetzky told police after the attack she didn't know her attacker's name but recognized her as a junior.Police said the staff member recognized her as Piccolo. Yesterday in the immediate aftermath of the attack the school immediately went into lock-down following the shocking event and Piccolo fled the scene in a grey 1992 Buick Park Avenue with Nebraska plate number TJM 557. Lincoln Police Captain David Beggs confirmed that a large survival knife was recovered from the bathroom along with a claw hammer. Following the brutal attack, Pius X was locked down for over two hours while a dozen officers, some armed with assault rifles, made three sweeps of the campus to try and find Piccolo. Lincoln Police Officer Katie Flood confirmed that Kopetzky was cut across the face and also was struck in the head with a hammer. One student recalled the frantic vice principal running down the hallway just after being informed of the attack.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ever felt that your fast food order didn't look quite as appetising as it did on the advert? Photographer Dario D was fed up with disappointing purchases and decided to see how the food sold over the counter matched up to the promised product. He bought burgers and tacos from some of the biggest chains in the United States and set them up in his studio for a professional standard photo shoot. And the difference was clear to see. Photographer Dario D decided to find out how many fast food products actually looked like their advert. This Big Mac couldn't reach the same height as the advertised burger . When the photographer opened the Big Mac, he found that it was missing most of its lettuce . Dario D even found that the advertised Big Mac would be far too big for its box . The photographer found that most of the burgers he bought were not quite as tall as the adverts promised they would be. In fact, Big Macs would struggle to fit inside their boxes if they matched their picture. And another McDonald's burger, the Angus Deluxe Third Pounder, would have the same trouble. Dario D embarked on the project following: 'a lifetime of disappointment, bafflement, and rage', posting the results on his website. He gave Burger King's Whopper a few tries, but after slightly squashed results could only conclude: 'They need to fire the guy who does his yoga on top of the Whoppers.' But despite the generous lettuce, the photographer found that the advertised Angus Deluxe was another McDonald's burger that did not seem to fit in its box . For this Angus Deluxe third pounder burger, Dario D praised the amount of lettuce it came with . A McDonald's Big N' Tasty with cheese got a big green tick from Dario D as the burger that most closely matched its advert . In one side-by-side comparison, he . showed the results of asking staff at different locations to make the . Whopper look like its advert. 'Both times, the cashiers turned and took strangely long, careful looks, as if nobody had ever requested that before,' he said. 'They said sure.' Out of curiosity, Dario D complained about the 'misleading' adverts. A member of Burger King's Consumer Relations Team replied: 'One may find the Whopper Sandwich as pictured in commercials more attractive because during photo sessions, professional food stylists are used to ensure the consistency and appearance.' When he bought a Whopper from Burger King, Dario found that his purchase fell a little flat compared with the one packed with tomato, lettuce, onion and pickles in the ad . The photographer gave the BK Whopper another try - but it still couldn't quite live up to its promise . Dario D then asked two different branches of Burger King to make burgers that looked like the advert - and these were the results . It wasn't just burger chains where the food failed to size up to its commercial counterpart. In Taco Bell and Jack in the Box, the tacos were thin compared with the packed shells in the adverts. Of the Taco Bell results, he said: 'Since these tacos are pretty dry and empty, I can only tolerate them with hot sauce, which, for me, is when they become good.' With the help of a greenscreen and rotating chair, Dario D took each product's photo at the most flattering angle he could before using digital software to show the advert and real product side-by-side. He said: 'I gave the items as fair a chance as absolutely possible'. This is what the photographer, who documented his findings on his blog, was handed when he asked for Burger King's Whopper Jr burger . It wasn't just burgers that fell short of expectations. Dario D bought the crunchy taco on the right from Taco Bell, expecting something looking like the one on the left . And at U.S. brand Jack in the Box, the photographer bought four sets of tacos before deciding to photograph this pair - the best of the bunch .","Photographer Dario D compared over the counter purchases with their ads .

The woman who planted the kiss on the President's lips said: 'I hope Michelle forgives me for it.'ABC US News | ABC Business News . Obama's entrance to the room they had been meeting in was a surprise to the women, who had been invited to Washington D.C for a week to meet Vice President Joe Biden . One of the women sprung up when Obama entered and immediately announced . 'I want a hug!' before planting a kiss on the lips of the President . Phyllis Gould had been writing letters to the White House for 12 years in the hopes of meeting the president, because she felt her and her fellow Riveters weren't being given enough credit for their services during the war, amid fears that they wouldn't be around for much longer. She finally got her letters answered when vice president Joe Biden invited them to the White House for a personal meet and greet, and a week trip to Washington D.C. She told ABC News: 'All the military had monuments and recognition and we didn’t get any. 'In the schools . they’re not even teaching about World War II, so if anybody’s going to . remember us, I wanted to be a big bang here — and we’re having it. 'They were on the battlefield but we were on the home front. 'The war wouldn't have been won without us.' The Riveters who visited the White House, made famous by the iconic poster seen throughout the war, were welders, electricians and drafters at the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California, during WWII.

Gould, from California, prompted the visit by writing a letter to the . vice president and explaining it was their dream to meet the president . and vice president. They spoke of their experiences during the war fondly, but also explained that they were just young ladies trying to make the best of it at the time. Mrs Gould said: 'I was 20 years old and I was having fun. 'I can claim I was patriotic, but that isn’t quite the way I remember it. 'I was but other things were taking priority such as fancy underwear and Frank Sinatra records. When asked if there would be a monument made in their honor, one Riveter exclaimed, 'We hope so!' Regarding a possible statue, Mrs Gould joked: 'That’s the next thing we’ll work on.' Before they head home, they will be having an intimate meeting with the vice president to round off the visit. 'We’re having breakfast tomorrow morning with Vice President Biden at his home. said one Riveter. Mrs Gould added: 'And he says he’s got more stuff planned for us but it’s a secret, it will be a surprise!'. President Obama, who surprised the ladies with his visit, said: 'These ladies all remind me of my grandmother. 'My grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line while my grandfather was off in the army. 'So I'm very proud to be here.' Biden said he decided to have the women to the White House being he wanted to honor their service. He said: 'This was the start of the real women's liberation. 'These women, working in the factory doing anything any man could do, it began to change everything. 'What fundamentally changed the war was our ability to make more aircraft, more landing craft, and other equipment.

Colin Chisholm did not declare that he . ran a business nor Lady Chisholm that she had a dog kennel which breeds . championship-worthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands. Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Carribbean. Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, of Deephaven, Minnesota, have been charged with wrongfully obtaining $165,000 in welfare and are still at large . Lady Chisholm is alleged to have claimed for state prenatal care despite having millions of dollars in the bank . More than $1 million dollars flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, the complaint states. The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005. However for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim. In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker. Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, Eloise Heidecker and the Chisholms were evicted from the home. They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views. The home, built in 1909, has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records. None . of these details were declared on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea . Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her . elderly grandmother. The couple moved to a lakefront property on Lake Minnetonka in 2008 - all the while raking in thousands in welfare payments . Hennepin . County Attorney Mike Freeman said on Friday: 'It is truly outrageous . when persons of considerable means steal from the government and all of . us taxpayers through abusing the social welfare system. 'We will prosecute this case with all the capacity we have.' Hennepin . County’s Human Services and Public Health Department terminated all . welfare benefits to the Chisholms at the end of March 2012.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An East Tennessee couple have been charged with murder after an autopsy revealed the man's five-year-old daughter had been forced to drink more than two liters of grape soda and water. Alexa Linboom was suffering from extreme brain damage when she was brought to an emergency room on January 1, 2012, by her father, Randall Vaughn and her stepmother, Mary. An investigation found the young girl had been forced to drink the water and soda in one to two hours as punishment after taking one of her stepmother's drinks. Murder charge: Randall and Mary Vaughn allegedly forced his daughter to drink excessive amounts of soda . The huge intake of fluid caused her brain to swell and herniate, which led to her death on January 3, 2012. Vaughn, 41 ,and his wife, 58, have been charged with first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated child neglect and aggravated child abuse. Attorney-general Berkeley Bell told the Times News that after allegedly forcing their child to drink an excessive amount of fluid, they failed to seek immediate medical help. 'Our position is it was a matter of several hours after the child started exhibiting serious symptoms, after the child was screaming out in pain, went into a paralyzed state, and became unconscious [that they sought help,' Bell said. After a two-year investiagtion it was found that Alexa was killed by acute fluid intoxication , which caused hyponatremic encephalopathy. Killed: Alexa Linboom, five, suffered brain damage after being made to drink 2l of fluid in under two hours . Bell said there was no history of abuse on record at the Vaughan family home, but added: 'They did employ some alternative forms of punishment.' 'Allegedly the child, as a form of punishment, was forced to drink grape drinks, as well as a great deal of water, to the point that her body became water intoxicated,' Bell said. 'That led to her brain swelling and all of her systems shutting down, and to her eventual brain death.' Alexa's biological mother lives out of state and six other children who were living in the Vaughan house are now in foster care. The couple are being held on $500,000 bond and are due to appear in court on Friday.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . New York City must pay $46,000 for a 20-year-old male foster child to undergo surgery to become a woman, ruled a judge. The New York Post reports that this is the fourth time the Administration for Children's Services has paid for a sex change operation. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Peter Moulton ordered that the ACS must pay for the genital 'reassignment, facial feminization, tracheal shaving, breast augmentation, and laser hair removal' of the plaintiff identified as D.F. The Administration fro Children's Services must pay for the genital reassignment, facial feminization, tracheal shaving, breast augmentation, and laser hair removal of the plaintiff . The Judge referenced the prejudice against transgendered people and said it will make it difficult for the plaintiff identified as D.F. to raise the money for the procedures on her own once she is out of foster care. The judge said that not only is D.F. not connected with her family, she also doesn't have a high school diploma. The ACS argued against D.F. and said she was a bad candidate for surgery because she 'misses appointments' and she is 'absent form her group home.' Even though D.F. lacked support from the ACS, two psychiatrists and a psychologist at her group home said that she'd be a good candidate for the operation. 'Certainly for the near future, her inability to pay for the procedures is clear,' Moulton wrote. Moulton said that the city was being 'arbitrary and capricious' in denying the funding for D.F's surgery. 'Payment by ACS for necessary medical procedures may be a transgendered youth’s only chance to achieve congruence between her gender identity and her physical appearance,” the judge wrote.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . The police officer who fatally shot a Hofstra University junior as she was being held at gunpoint by an intruder last year has been cleared of any wrongdoing. Officer Nikolas Budimlic ‘acted accordingly’ when he opened fire, killing not only the armed suspect but 21-year-old Andrea Rebello in May 2013, at an off-campus New York house, the Nassau County District Attorney's Office announced on Wednesday following an 11-month investigation. Budimlic ‘reasonably perceived threats of deadly force against himself and others and acted accordingly,’ the report states. Scroll down for video . Twins Jessica and Andrea Rebello, seen in this undated Facebook photo, were startled when Dalton Smith broke into their off-campus home . The suspect, Delton Smith, 30, who was a wanted felon after breaking parole for an armed robbery, was shot seven times by the responding officer. ‘Though the results were unquestionably tragic, criminal charges under these circumstances would be inappropriate and legally unsustainable,’ Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said at the conclusion of a 28-page report into the May 2013 shooting. The prosecutor concluded that the death of 21-year-old Andrea Rebello of Tarrytown, N.Y., was caused by gunman Dalton Smith's decisions to break into a Hempstead residence armed with a gun, taking several residents hostage and then refusing to surrender when police arrived. Rice's report for the first time publicly identifies the police officer involved in the shooting as Nikolas Budimlic, an eight-year veteran of the Nassau Police Department who had previously spent 12 years as a New York City police officer.

Andrea and Jessica Rebello, pictured, reportedly lived close to campus . Budimlic was among the first officers to respond to a report of an early morning robbery at a house near the Hofstra campus. After . entering the house, the officer soon encountered Smith holding Rebello . in a headlock. Smith maneuvered down a flight of stairs and was . attempting to leave with the young woman through a rear door, hollering . expletives at police officers and threatening to shoot the student. ‘Smith . ignored numerous commands to drop his weapon and repeated his threats . to shoot both Andrea Rebello and Officer Budimlic,’ the report states. ‘Officer .

He never got to say goodbye to his sweetheart before she was killed . Rice's report noted that Smith, 30, had been on parole for his involvement in an armed robbery. An arrest warrant had been issued for him about three weeks before the fatal shooting occurred. Smith also had prior convictions for attempted robbery and weapons possession. It . was not clear whether the weapon he was carrying the night of the . Hofstra robbery was operable, the report found.

In the next four years, the energetic child won't be able to walk or feed herself, before developing seizures and movement disorders. And then, she will die. But the South Carolina toddler's family hope to avoid the horrible prognosis by raising $1 million to fund a known cure for Sanfilippo Syndrome, the disease Eliza was diagnosed with in July. 'You know where it's headed. It's headed towards pain for her and as a father you want to be able to protect your children,' Eliza's devastated father, Glenn O'Neill, said. 'The donations that come in will fund this clinical trial and fund a chance at life for Eliza. That is the hope we hold on to.' Scroll down for video .

New York Daily News reported Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, plan to test the cure, but it will cost . about $2.5 million to produce the treatment and run the trial. The gene therapy trial scheduled for late 2014 is specifically for children with Sanfilippo Syndrome, a rare metabolic disorder that causes major muscle growth deficiencies. Eliza's parents, Glenn and Cara O'Neill, say the treatment would save their daughter and literally stop the disease in its tracks overnight. They're in a desperate race against time to raise enough money to fund the cure that would save Eliza and others like her. The O'Neill's say Eliza is 'a fun loving four-year-old who loves to sing, run and most of all, cuddle. She loves to play dress up and horse around with her rowdy big brother Beckham'. The Dora the Explorer-loving toddler is also incredibly active and loves to spend time with her family. But that could all change if her condition isn't treated in the next six months.

There is something very real that exists, that with enough money will happen, and will happen in time for our Eliza, and other kids... 'It's not a question of if this can happen. This will happen.' Sanfilippo Syndrome is caused by a defect in a single cell that eventually leads to progressive degeneration of the central nervous system. Most sufferers don't live past their early teens, and don't show visible signs until their preschool years. CNN reported that Sanfilippo has been overlooked by the pharmaceutical industry because it is so rare. About 16 children suffer from Sanfilippo Type C in the United States. This means very few federal dollars are allocated for funding rare disease research. However, actor Jonny Lee Miller has actively campaigned for more funding for the disease since learning a crew member's son, Jonah, was diagnosed with Sanfilippo Syndrome. 'The answers and the cures are right around the corner,' Miller told CBS. 'There’s just not enough money going into this right now, and we’re talking about little kids.' Miller has addressed a congressional caucus in Washington on behalf of rare disease organizations. He also founded the Jonah Just Begun Foundation and will be running in the North Face Bear Mountain Run in Bear Mountain, New York on May 4 and 5 for Jonah and for Jonah Just Begun.

"By . Associated Press . An elite Marine rapid response team has arrived in Yemen's capital in the wake of violent protests at the U.S. Embassy over a film critical of Islam, the Pentagon said Friday, as a nervous Obama administration watched anti-American demonstrations spread across the Middle East and North Africa. Pentagon press secretary George Little said the decision to dispatch about 50 Marines to Sanaa was partly in response to the violence and partly as a precautionary measure. The Marines are members of a platoon from a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team, a specially trained and configured group that makes short-notice deployments in response to terrorist threats and to reinforce security at U.S. embassies. A similar team was dispatched to Tripoli, Libya, on Wednesday in response to the deadly consulate attack in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stephens and three other Americans. Known as a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team, or FAST, the team's role is to respond on short notice to terrorism threats and to bolster security at U.S. embassies. They operate worldwide, and the team that went is one of two that are based in Spain. Increased security: US Marines fortify with barbed wire the vicinity of a hotel that is adjacent to the US embassy in Sanaa, Yemen in this file photo . Burnt out; Libyan military guards check one of the U.S. Consulate's burnt out buildings. Marines have been sent to reinforce the embassy in Tripoli . Administration officials who discussed the Marines spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the military movements. The Marines arrived at the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, and there were no immediate plans for them to advance to Benghazi. Officials said they did not know how long the team might stay there. A second Marine FAST element was standing by in Spain but had no orders to move, officials said. The Pentagon also ordered two Navy destroyers to the Libyan coast. Officials said the ships, the USS McFaul and USS Laboon, which carry Tomahawk cruise missiles, did not have a specific mission, but they give commanders flexibility to respond to any mission ordered by the president. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the U.S. military regularly takes precautionary steps when potential contingencies might arise in a given situation. He did not comment on ship movements. Heightened security: Armed policemen stand guard at the entrance to the US embassy in Manila as security is ramped up across the globe . U.S. embassies, particularly in major countries and in unstable or less secure nations, usually have a resident contingent of Marine security guards. Early indications were that there was no Marine security unit at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. A consulate is a branch office in major cities outside the capital. These guards work under the supervision of the senior diplomatic officer at an embassy. The main role of Marine security guards is to protect classified national security documents, according to the web site of the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group, which administers the security guard mission from a Marine base in Virginia. Their secondary role is to protect U.S. citizens and U.S. government property in the event of an emergency. The Marines began their security guard mission in 1948. They are trained at the Marine Security Guard School.In rare cases, the Marines send a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team, or a portion of the team, to reinforce security at embassies. They were sent to Africa, for example, in response to the 1998 terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A FAST group also provided security aboard a Navy hospital ship in New York following the 9/11 attacks.",Marines also arrived in Yemen today .
"By . Alexandra Klausner . Circumcision is becoming less common is the United States and there is a direct correlation between uncircumcised males and increased risk for diseases such as HIV and HPV, says a new study by Mayo Clinic. Brian Morris, coauthor of the new report and professor emeritus in the School of Medical Sciences at the University of Sydney said that 'Infancy circumcision should be regarded as equivalent to childhood vaccination.' CBS News reports that the American Academy of Pediatrics came out with a public statement in 2012 that supported education and access to infant male circumcision. Doctors argue that circumcision should be as commonplace as childhood vaccination because of it's ability to prevent sexually transmitted infections . Circumcision among newborns has declined from 83 per cent in the 1960s to 77 per cent in 2010. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that the circumcision rates of US males aged 14 to 89 is 81 per cent. There is also a racial disparity of those receiving circumcision with those who did not that's based around cultural and educational factors. In the last decade 91 per cent of white Americans are circumcised, 76 per cent of black men are circumcised and 44 per cent of Hispanic men are circumcised. The authors of the paper hypothesize that as the Hispanic population in the U.S. starts tp rise, families within that demographic are less familiar with circumcision and its health benefits. A gap in Health Insurance access for Americans has resulted in families opting out of circumcision procedures in order to save money. This graph shows the decline of circumcision rates in the U.S. after the 1960s . Circumcision boasts an array of health benefits including UTI prevention in infants and adults. Circumcision is also known to lower one's risk for contracting HIV and HPV, the latter of which can cause genital warts and even some cancers. CBS reports that a study published in the Journal of American medicine found reviewed more than 500 studies and found that circumcision reduces risk for HIV in straight males by 60 per cent, genital her4pes by 30 per cent, and cancer causing HPV by 35 per cent. Those who oopose circumcision argue that removing the foreskin at any age decreases sensitivity during sexual activity. Others argue that circumcision is a human rights issue and should be the choice of the child.","There is a direct correlation between .

The camera was discovered by another Microsoft employee who passed the device along to  company security who then handed it over to the Redmond Police Department. Raymundo was caught out because he managed to film himself while setting up the camera on July 24 last year. No victims have been identified. Police searched Raymundo's computer and found videos taken with a hidden camera. He allegedly admitted to filming 'up skirts' during a police interview days after the camera as discovered.

"By . Mark Prigg . For any self respecting scuba assassin, they are the essential weapons. From the Heckler & Koch P11 underwater pistol to the the Special Underwater Assault Rifle that can shoot darts, weapons makers have created a whole line of underwater weapons. As normal guns and ammunition do not work underwater, they also have their own ammunition, with many firing darts rather than bullets. Scroll down for video . Underwater weapons are a staple of films such as Underwater Guns - Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life . Standard ammunition can be fired underwater, but the range and accuracy is hugely affected by water. Therefore, weapons designers based underwater pistols on spears rather than bullets, shrinking them down to fit in a handheld gun. The first weapon is believed to be Germany's Heckler & Koch P11 Underwater Pistol. Originally designed in the 1970's, it fires up to five fin stabilized, rocket propelled darts that are self contained inside individual barrels. Since ordinary-shaped rounds are inaccurate and have a very short range when used underwater, this pistol fires steel darts about 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long. It has five barrels, each of which is loaded with a cartridge. After firing all five cartridges, the barrel unit must be sent back to its manufacturer for reloading. The darts measure 7.62mm X 100mm and are effective underwater to about 50 feet near the surface, with decaying range the deeper you descend into the abyss. Above water, the P11 has a range of about 100 feet, although experts say its accuracy is poor. The P11 Underwater Pistol, originally designed in the 1970's . Russia also developed underwater weapons. The SPP-1 Underwater Pistol was made in the USSR for use underwater by Soviet frogmen as an underwater firearm. It was developed in the late 1960s and accepted for use in 1971. It fires a round-based 4.5 millimetres (0.18 in) caliber steel dart about 115 millimetres (4.5 in) long. Dr. Philip H. Dater takes aim with the SSP-1M 4-barrel underwater pistol . 4.5mm cartridges for the SPP-1M pistol.

Here she is pictured at a court appearance in January . Bad egg: Kelley has a lengthy arrest record and has been arrested for drug and alcohol charges . Reckless: Kelley drunkenly fired gunshots into the air, once of which hit his precious daughter . How it happened: Police say the 34-year-old Kelley fired shots into the air outside the house in January while arguing with the girl's mother and that one of the shots hit his daughters bedroom . Kelley has a lengthy arrest record and has been arrested for drug and alcohol charges. He also has been charged 3 times in 12 years with domestic violence against Kristina Lanza - with each charge later dropped. Kelley was convicted in 2003 for assault of two other people, . Kelley's attorney, Hugh McCloskey Jr., says that after talking the case over with the judge, his client realized that a six-year sentence was the best deal he was going to get. Kelley fired several gunshots with a brown revolver into the air, one of which entered the bedroom window of little Shanti Lanza, killing her. She died at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Lanza's three siblings were also in the home at the time of the incident along with some friends who were sleeping over. Violence in his blood: Kelley has been charged three times in 12 years with domestic violence against his long-time girlfrfiend and mother of his child Kristina Lanza . Antwone Kelley said his brother had left the family's home unaware that his daughter had been shot. 'He might drink a little bit but that was his child, that was his baby. He didn't mean to do this at all. He's more heartbroken than anybody,' he said. Shanti was found bleeding in her bedroom. She had been hit in the chest. She was the second of Kelley's children to be shot and killed. His son, David Gill, 16, died after a 2012 triple shooting. Their parents had been together for about 15 years, but had a troubled relationship, family members said. Kelley had been arrested for a domestic disturbance involving Shanti's mother in 2007. Vince Lanza, Shantiâ€™s uncle, said: 'It was one of those relationships that they can't be together but they can't be without each other.' Kelley, facing more than 20 years in prison on the original manslaughter charge and other charges, was balking on a plea deal offering a six-year sentence, the minimum possible. Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier said prosecutors only offered the minimum because Kristina Lanza demanded the most lenient sentence possible for her boyfriend. During a break for Kelley to consider the offer, family members and friends of Kelley and Lanza argued aggressively with Piepmeier, saying the proposed six-year sentence for killing the girl was too harsh. Killed by a stray: Shanti was hiding in an upstairs bedroom whilst her parents argued. The bullet struck her in the chest and she bled to death . One husband and wife were kicked out of court; the wife, who created an uproar in the hall, was arrested. Tina Lanza was one of several people who physically erupted with emotion and vocal outbursts when Allen read the length of the prison sentence. She and Danielle Lott, who identified herself as Shanti's aunt, were held in contempt of court after ignoring multiple requests to tone down their behavior, Allen said. Both women will appear in court on Thursday for a contempt hearing. 'I've handled dozens and dozens of child murders in my career,' prosecutor Piepmeier said. ""This is the first time I've ever had the mother of a murder victim tell me we're treating the person that killed her child too harshly.

"By . Associated Press . What could be controversial about the city of Toronto congratulating Canada's Olympic and Paralympic athletes? Ask Rob Ford. The Toronto mayor on Wednesday cast the sole 'no' vote on a City Council motion to offer the athletes kudos. Minutes earlier, he also was the only council member to vote against a proposal to name a Toronto street after the late Nelson Mandela. Ford asked for a re-vote on both motions a half-hour later but was denied. Lone dissenter: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford voted no on two popular measures in City Council on Wednesday. Pictured above at a City Council meeting in November . 'We all make errors,' said Ford, who claimed he was stretching a sore back and voted quickly. 'I guess I pushed the wrong button. Of course I support Nelson Mandela.' The mayor also said he supports Olympic athletes. Ford is seeking re-election this year despite a record of erratic behavior. After he acknowledged last year that he had smoked crack, the City Council voted to strip him of most of his mayoral powers. Ford is known for often casting the lone dissenting vote, but his votes on Wednesday drew gasps in the council chamber. City councilor Adam Vaughn said Ford knew exactly what he was doing. 'Everyone when he did it said, ""What are you doing, Rob?""' Vaughn said. 'He shrugged his shoulders and let it go. And then a half-hour later, not immediately, a half-hour later, when Twitter and social media went off the charts, his staff came and said, ""You better fix this. You look like a fool."" Because you know what? He is one.' Claim to fame: Ford made headlines last year when reports surfaced he was filmed smoking crack. Above, a screen grab from the tape seized by Toronto Police . Ford denied it took him a half-hour to ask for a re-vote, saying he asked for it immediately. When reporters asked if he knew what he was voting on, Ford said, 'Forget it, guys.' The mayor's brother, city councilor Doug Ford, defended him, saying voting errors are often made in council and no one should take offense. 'No one in this city supports the black community more than Rob Ford. No one. Bottom line. Zing. Done,' Doug Ford said. 'And no one supports the Olympic athletes more than Rob Ford.' On Tuesday, Ford didn't show for the council meeting until the afternoon. His chief of staff, Dan Jacobs, said he was feeling ill. Doug Ford said the mayor hurt his back lifting weights last Friday and was seeing a chiropractor.","Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was the lone dissenter on two popular measures passed in City Council on Wednesday .

"By . Luke Garratt . Dramatic footage has been released showing the first rescues since the Darington landslide that obliterated a community last month. The landslide in Washington State has so far claimed 29 lives, but there was a ray of hope in the form of a woman who was among the first rescued, winched to safety with the only possession she has left...a painting of a wolf. Robin Youngblood, from Oso, a woman of Native American faith, can be seen clutching the painting, which she claims represents the spirit animal that helped keep her alive during the fatal landslide. Scroll down for video . Randy Fay and Robin Youngblood stand with the painting (left) which is her only possession left after the catastrophic landslide that claimed her house . The landslide claimed almost everything that Robin Youngblood owned, but thanks to search and rescue worker Randy Fay (pictured hanging from helicopter) she was able to keep hold of one possession - a painting of a wolf . Ms Youngblood was lifted on the first rescue helicopter hours after the landslide in Oso last month. Like many others, her house was completely leveled, but she was luckily saved by rescue crew member Randy Fay. The incredible footage shows Mr Fay saving Ms Youngblood, only to save the painting which coincidentally floated past them at the time of rescue. According to Ms Youngblood, the painting bobbed on the surface of the muddy water and floated right next to her while she waited for rescue. Randy Fay hands the painting to another worker: Robin Youngblood saw the painting bob over towards her in the water just before her rescue, and considered this a sign from her Creator that she was saved . Robin Youngblood is led away to safety by her saviour Randy Fay, who also saved her wolf painting . She believes that the appearance of the painting was no coincidence. Ms Youngblood said: 'It's a Cherokee night warrior, and the title of the painting is ""Wolf Vision"". 'For me it was sort of a sign that the Creator was protecting us and that we were going to make it out of there. 'Seeing it float up there, when everything else was matchsticks let me know that we were going to make it through this thing.' Robin Youngblood believes that her spirit animal, the wolf, was the reason for her rescue, as it gave her strength throughout the ordeal . Ms Youngblood and her eventual saviour Mr Fay have since been able to meet for the first time since the rescue, in which Fay helped to preserve the painting. Mr Fay said: 'If that's the first dot in reconnecting and building her life, I'm glad we were able to do that.' Search and rescue events have been redoubled since the event ahead of forecasts of returning showers that could exacerbate rescue conditions. Randy Fay and Robin Youngblood meet for the first time since the landslide destroyed her entire home except for her one possession . Mr Fay was happy to have saved the painting, even if it was only a small possession, saying: 'If that's the first dot in reconnecting and building her life, I'm glad we were able to do that' Since the event, 13 people have been registered as missing and 29 have been declared officially dead. The landslide struck on March 22, after a rain soaked hillside collapsed with no warning above the north side of the Stillaguamish River, which released a torrent of mud that washed over a state highway and three dozen houses on the outskirts of the town of Oso. Officials are now worried that in the light of slightly warmer weather snow on the hilltops could melt, causing fresh water to stream into the Stillaguamish River, possibly adding to floods and making search and . rescue efforts even harder. The hillsides near the scene of the mudslide are now almost barren, because of the sheer power of the unexpected torrent that also levelled many parts of the community . Capt. Jeff Zonrnes, of the Monroe Fire Department: Search efforts have been redoubled to take advantage of the three-day dry spell, ahead of expected showers that could make the search and rescue conditions worse . Some sections of the slide area are already under 25 feet of water and are believed to contain more human remains. There is also speculation that the area could be submerged by more than 100 feet of water within three to four weeks without a wider channel to divert the partially dammed river. Mike Asher, an area fire chief acting as the head of operations for the east side of the disaster zone, said: 'There's a lot of snow left on the mountains surrounding the valley.' (Left) An aerial view of the mudslide which has so far claimed 29 lives with another 13 missing. The mudslide covered both a local highway in the Washington area, and levelled around three dozen houses on the outskirts of the town of Oso . 'We're going to start facing runoff issues from that in the very near future.' President Barack Obama has approved the state's request for a major disaster declaration for the slide, making federal relief assistance available to individuals, households and businesses impacted by the tragedy. Twenty-six of those killed in the landslide have been identified, and authorities are still working to identify the three remaining confirmed fatalities.","Robin Youngblood was one of the first rescued from the landslide disaster .

"By . Ashley Collman . The New Jersey teen who sneaked past a sleeping security guard to reach the roof of the World Trade Center building made his first court appearance Wednesday. Justin Casquejo, 16, was initially charged with trespassing, but now faces actual jail time since the judge slapped him with another charge of BASE jumping - a class A misdemeanor. If convicted, the Weehawken, New Jersey native could end up behind bars for up to a year. Scroll down for video . Head down: 16-year-old Justin Casquejo made his first court appearance Wednesday as he faces trespassing charges for sneaking to the top of the World Trade Center last month . Serious crimes: Casquejo was hit with an additional charge of base jumping today, which could land him in jail for up to a year if convicted . Sly: Casquejo, of Weehawken, New Jersey, was . able to make it to the top of 1 WTC by slipping through a square-foot . hole in a fence surrounding the site . The judge also ordered Casquejo be assessed in a program for youth offenders. He is due back in court on April 20. Casquejo and his lawyer declined to comment outside the court house. The daredevil teen successfully made it to the top of 1 WTC on March 16, by slipping through a square-opening in the fence surrounding the site around 4am. Dressed as a construction worker, Casquejo eluded security and was able to take an elevator to the 88th floor. Daredevil: Casquejo sneaked into the WTC site and spent almost two hours on the roof of the nearly completed Freedom Tower before he was arrested by Port Authority police trying to leave. He is pictured at right on top of a construction crane in nearby Hoboken . From there he took the stairs all the way to the 104th floor and walked right past a sleeping security guard to access the roof. He spent about two hours on the roof before coming down and getting caught by Port Authority Police. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, is reevaluating their security measures. Since Casquejo's arrest last month, six others have also been arrested for sneaking in or attempting to sneak into the World Trade Center unauthorized. Thrillseeker: Casquejo, pictured on a construction crane in Hoboken, appears to love sneaking into tall buildings under construction . Two CNN journalists were arrested late last month trying three times to sneak past security and into the building in broad daylight. 'If a 16-year-old can get on the site, we should be able to get in as well,' one of them allegedly told the officer. Four other men were charged last month as well, for organizing a base jump off the building in September. 'We were a little bit shocked that they spent that much time and energy continuing to pursue something that they knew was not a terroristic act,' one of the jumpers, Andrew Rossing, told Good Morning America. 'Our intent was never for this to go public. We never posted the video footage. People didnâ€™t know about it. We kept things quiet. As far as we were concerned, no one ever needed to know,' he added. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that 'both City Hall and 1 Police Plaza are concerned about' the recent break-ins.","Justin Casquejo, 16, made his first court appearance Wednesday as he faces charges of trespassing .

"By . Tara Brady . A man from Florida hated his job so much that he staged a fake break-in at his house and called police so he would have an excuse to stay at home. Dwayne Yeager, 31, of Brandon, Florida, called police at 7.25am on Monday to report that a burglar had broken into his house. The father is believed to work in a fabrication job at Dooson Hydro Technology. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CCTV footage captures what appears to be Yeager setting up the fake break-in at his home . According to a police report, Yeager said the windows in his son's bedroom were open and that he saw a white Honda Civic pull away when he arrived. Worse than calling in sick: Dwayne Yeager staged a break-in at his house so he didn't have to go to work . In a call to police which was recorded and replayed on Bay News 9 he said: 'My TV's in there on the ground' and described the car as a 'white, kind of little Honda Civic pulling away. White, it had kind of like a black fender.' However, when police arrived they found no sign of forced entry and surveillance video appears to capture Yeager setting up the break-in. Neighbours say they saw Yeager leave, return home and open the windows himself, according to CBS Tampa. 'Thatâ€™s just absolutely ridiculous,' neighbour Doris Morell told Bay News 9. 'I mean, who would do that? Thatâ€™s just absurd.' According to police, Yeager eventually admitted he ransacked his own home to make it look like it had been broken into before calling police to avoid going to work. The report said : 'He stated his wife was adamant that he go to work and he didn't want to.' Yeager was held in custody and accused of providing false information. He was later released on $500 bail.

"By . Emma Lowe . Absolutely paranormal: Miss Saunders admits she believes in ghosts . For someone who insists she  does not believe in God and is  not superstitious, it is a rather surprising admission. But comedian Jennifer Saunders has confessed she believes in ghosts. The Absolutely Fabulous star, 55, claimed she may even have been haunted by her late grandmother after inadvertently moving into her old address. She said: ‘It could have all been in my head but when I was younger I thought I saw ghosts quite frequently. ‘Or at least there were strange happenings. I’d wake up and feel a bit funny, open my eyes and could see shapes. It got really scary. When I was at college I was living in a flat in London where there were lots of knockings at the windows and strange noises. ‘For ages I thought it was an annoying bird in the tree outside but there was no tree and absolutely nothing outside my window. Then one day, my mother gave me a photograph of my grandmother in a little lacy dress, being pushed in a swing by her father. ‘The back of the photograph said “15 Steeles Road” which was the address I was living at. And I thought “Ooh, that’s weird”.’ Miss Saunders – who did not appear to be joking – also told Woman and Home magazine: ‘I don’t believe in God and I’m not superstitious, but I do believe in ghosts.’ The comedian, who shot to fame in the 1980s after writing and starring alongside Dawn French in BBC sketch show French and Saunders, spoke of the joy her grandsons have brought her. Her eldest daughter Ella gave birth to first son Freddie two years ago and second son Bert  in February. Smash hit: Absolutely Fabulous with Edina (Jennifer Saunders) and Patsy (Joanna Lumley) Miss Saunders, whose book Bonkers: My Life in Laughs has been released in paperback, said: ‘I was at both births and it was just heaven. ‘We’re all so pleased because it’s a very female house and now we’ve got these two little boys who are just gorgeous. 'I’m a very hands-on granny. All those things I’ve kind of been grieving for, as my own kids have grown up. In an interview for the May issue of Woman & Home magazine, the comedian , 55, talks about changing her views on feminism, the lack of women on TV panel shows and how she's started writing the Ab Fab film . 'There’s nothing really fascinating about the ducks – or a tractor or the grass – but there is when you’re with a child. It’s just so lovely to do it all again with them.’ Raising three daughters has also transformed her views on feminism. Miss Saunders, who is married to fellow comic Adrian Edmondson, said: ‘My middle daughter Beattie does comedy and it’s a sad fact that boys have a much easier time. 'If you take a girls’ show and a similar boys’ show, the boys will get the job because there’s a prevailing thought that, “Hey, they’re wacky, they’re guys” versus “there’s the girls, trying a bit hard”. ‘It’s the same on the panel shows – it’s a boysy thing. It isn’t awful, because it’s actually funny a lot of the time. But a lot of the time it isn’t – it’s a competition to see how many times they can mention their genitalia – and sometimes you just think “Oh please just stop it!”’ Miss Saunders received worldwide acclaim in the early to mid-1990s for writing and playing the lead role of Edina Monsoon in the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous. The show also revived the career of actress Joanna Lumley. Miss Saunders is now writing the new Absolutely Fabulous film. She said she found the weight of expectation ‘more than for any series, so the fall could be a lot greater if it doesn’t work’.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A polar bear who survived a near fatal injury has defied the odds and is now rearing a second set of cubs. It was feared the bear, who appeared to have a badly broken leg, would have to be put down when spotted on a barrier island in Bernard Spit, Alaska in 2009. But five years on, the sow has now been spotted with a second set of cubs showing that her disability is not holding her back. The female polar bear, who survived a broken leg leads her new cubs along a barrier island in Bernard Spit, Alaska . The new set of pictures were captured by wildlife photographer,  Steve Kazlowski, who has been monitoring the bear since 2009 . Wildlife photographer Steve Kazlowski has been monitoring the polar bear over the years, charting her progress. He said: 'Her new cubs are only a year old and I don't know if her other cubs made it. 'I observed her many times during the eight weeks that I was photographing polar bears last fall. The female polar bear, who suffered a near fatal broken leg, poses with her cubs, left. Mr Kazlowski says the sow, right, has learned to deal with her disability as one of her legs has calloused over internally . The female bear, seen here, starts to head into the water for a swim . The two cubs, who follow their mother, are thought to be her second set of cubs. Her first set were first spotted in 2011 . It is thought that the new cubs are around one year old with Mr Kazlowski monitoring them over an eight week period . 'She was feeding, resting, playing, walking and swimming - doing all the natural things you would expect a polar bear to do. 'I would imagine her chances of survival are pretty good as she has been able to survive with a bad leg and she has her second set of cubs now. 'I was so happy to see that an animal with a disability was able to learn to live and cope with it. 'Not only that she is thriving and bringing up her offspring. 'Every female polar bear giving birth is a good thing with all the changes that are going on with their habitats. The trio of polar bears pause for a break, with one of the cubs lying down rolling about in the snow . Mr  Kazlowski said: 'Every female polar bear giving birth is a good thing with all the changes that are going on with their habitats.' The female bear leads her cubs into the water for a swim in Bernard Spit, Alaska . 'It shows that she is a very smart mother and is raising intelligent cubs.' The bear was first spotted in Alaska in 2009, when she appeared to have a badly broken leg, which was causing her to walk more slowly. It was thought at the time that she would be unable to survive but remarkably the animal has learned to deal with her disability. In 2011, just two years after her life-threatening injury, she showed up with her first set of cubs. Photographer Mr Kozlowski is now interested to see if the bears show up on Bernard Spit again next year . Mr Kazlowski added: 'We knew it was the same bear because she's the only one who shows with the same break in the same spot. 'The first couple of years she walked softly on it but has now figured out how to move efficiently with it. 'The leg has calloused over internally so it hangs and dangles - it will remain that way for the rest of her life. 'She moves fine and seems to have more confidence and now has another litter of cubs. She just showed up along the coast again and I saw her. She is hard to miss with that leg. 'It will be interesting to see if she shows up next fall.' Mr Kazlowski believes that the female polar bear is a 'a very smart mother and is raising intelligent cubs'.","The female bear has been pictured with her second set of cubs along Bernard Spit in Alaska .

"By . Andrew Chesterton . A disabled pizza chef is suing his county council for tens of thousands of pounds after his false leg snapped off and became embedded in his stump after he fell into a gigantic pothole. Stephen Strassen was on his way to his corner shop when he tripped into the 2ft deep crater outside his Lincolnshire home, which had opened up after weeks of heavy rain. The 52-year-old’s prosthetic left leg, which he uses after his limb was amputated following a car crash, snapped in two and became embedded in his stump, splitting it to the bone. Stephen Strassen snapped his prosthetic leg in half after falling into a pothole near his Lincolnshire home . 'My stump hit the ground with an . almighty force,' he said. 'There was just a big thump and I knew something was . wrong so I called my wife for help straight away.' Mr Strassen managed to call for help and his wife Anna, 42, hauled him out of the 5ft wide hole and dragged him inside their Boston home following the accident on January 17. The next day his stump had swelled so much that Anna, a nurse, took her husband to hospital where he was forced to undergo surgery to because his wounded limb had become infected. The force of the impact was so severe it split Mr Strassen's stump to the bone. He required surgery the following day to fight off infection . 'I was in agony, I can’t describe the pain,' he said. 'It was absolutely awful, my foot came clean off and I just fell. 'The leg didn’t swell up straight away, . it happened overnight and the swelling went right to the bone, under the . skin, there was a massive cavity which caused fluid to build up and . break through.' Mr Strassen, who was forced to take months . off work, is now suing Lincolnshire County Council who are responsible . for maintaining the roads . But the council has vowed to fight any compensation claim. A . council spokesman said: 'We were sorry to hear of the gentleman’s accident, . however, this claim has been denied following consideration of the . normal legal principles that apply in connection with a claim of this . nature.' Mr . Strassen said he used to live an active lifestyle before the accident, . but he hasn't been able to fit a prosthetic leg on his wounded limb . since the fall. He's been unable to work, and has spent the past three . months confined to a wheelchair. The once-active amputee has been confined to a wheelchair since falling into a huge pot hole in a lane near his home (pictured right) “My life has changed completely because of . this. “All I want to do is go back to work but I . can’t, I feel awful as this has affected my wife too who is trying to bring . home the money for the both of us.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . When our robot overlords come to power, they may not look exactly how you imagined. If Festo has its way, they could look more like unstoppable hopping kangaroos rather than Terminator-style machines. For the past two years, the German group has been secretly working emulating the jumping behaviour of the kangaroo in robot form. Scroll down for video... It’s one of their most ambitious bio-inspired robots yet and could help improve industrial automation systems that manufacture products such as cars and computers. Dubbed BionicKangaroo, the robot is controlled by gestures and can efficiently recover energy from one jump to help it make the next. It does this by using an elastic spring, which partially ‘charges’ the legs on landing, according to a report by Evan Ackerman in IEEE Spectrum. For the past two years, the German group Festo has been secretly working emulating the jumping behaviour of the kangaroo in robot form . Before the initial jump, the elastic tendon is pneumatically pre-tensioned and the BionicKangaroo shifts its centre of gravity forwards. When a certain angle is reached, the pneumatic cylinders are activated and the energy from the tendon is released. This causes the kangaroo to take off and as it does, it pulls its legs forward creating torque at the hip. During landing, the tendon is tensed again to convert the kinetic energy of the previous jump to potential energy for the next jump. This is similar to the technique used by kangaroos who use their tendons like elastic springs to bound from one area to another. As well as the elastic spring, the company’s Bionic Learning Network also installed a small storage tank to provide high pressure air for the pneumatic muscles to power the movement of the robot. ‘With the BionicKangaroo we have precisely reproduced the most characteristic features of natural kangaroos: recuperating and storing energy, and then releasing it once more in the next bound,’ Festo’s Dr Heinrich Frontzek said. The entire robotic animal weighs just 15 lb (7kg) and stands 3ft 3inches (1m), but it can jump 1ft 3inches (40cm) vertically and 2ft 7 inch (0.8 metres) horizontally. Before the initial jump, the elastic tendon is pneumatically pre-tensioned and the BionicKangaroo shifts its centre of gravity forwards. The RoboticKangaroo (right) partially ‘charges’ the legs on landing. Its movement is based on that of a real kangaroo (left) which uses its tendons like elastic springs to bound from one area to another . A combination of drives, control technology and the mobile energy supply help power the BionicKangaroo . When a certain angle is reached, the pneumatic cylinders are activated and the energy from the tendon is released. This causes the kangaroo to take off and as it does, it pulls its legs forward creating torque at the hip. During landing, the tendon is tensed again to convert the kinetic energy of the previous jump to potential energy for the next jump. Festo said that it has no plans to release robotic kangaroos, but hopes its latest creation will help demonstrate how energy from movement can be recovered more effectively.

"By . Tara Brady . A Lego enthusiast has spent one month building a fully functioning keyboard made entirely from the coloured bricks. Jason Allemann, 41, used more than 1,500 Lego pieces to create the keyboard which can be used on any computer. Lego has captured the imaginations of children and adults for generations resulting in millions of sets being manufactured each year. A Lego enthusiast has spent one month building a fully functioning keyboard entirely from the coloured bricks . Mr Alleman, from Ontario, in Canada, said: 'I had seen some other custom themed keyboards online, built using other materials, and I thought they were pretty cool. It sparked my interest in building one using Lego bricks. 'My love for Lego began as a child. I really enjoyed building and playing with the classic Lego space and early Technic sets. Since coming back into the hobby as an adult, I probably have somewhere around 500,000 Lego pieces in my collection.' The keyboard is fully functional and capable of performing to the same level as a normal keyboard. 'It's pretty part intensive,' said Mr Allemann, a computer software developer who displays his Lego models under the name JK Brickwork. The keyboard is fully functional and capable of performing to the same level as a normal keyboard . 'Most of the keys are built using nine pieces and there are over 100 keys. Add a few hundred pieces for the frame and I would guess there are around 1,200 pieces in it.' Mr Alleman had to track down every single lettered tile to complete the keyboard, forcing him to get creative with a few symbols such as the colon, semi-colon and slashes. He said: 'I had most of the pieces already in my collection, so it didn't really cost me much to source the few extra parts I needed. 'Lego is pretty expensive though, and I'm sure sourcing all the parts from scratch would cost well over $100.' One of the main issues Mr Alleman encountered while constructing the keyboard was aligning the keys over the membrane, which he accomplished by using a system of Lego Technic axles to precisely position the keys. Time consuming: Mr Alleman had to track down every single lettered tile to complete the keyboard . The second problem was even more difficult as a standard keyboard is screwed together in order to keep the interface, between the original circuit board and sensor membrane under pressure, causing Jason to use non-standard building techniques to replicate the same amount of pressure. After putting the project to one side for a number of years, due to frustrations with the angle of the keyboard, Jason revived the project earlier this year to the delight of Lego fans across the world. His YouTube video highlighting the project has already become a hit, having been viewed around 750,000 times. However, to the dismay of many LEGO fans, Jason has no plans to create any more Lego keyboards and it will only be for his personal use. 'The feedback has been incredible. It seems a lot of people have really enjoyed seeing what is otherwise a pretty dull, everyday object rendered in more of a humorous and whimsical Lego form. I have had countless requests for instructions or to outright purchase it. 'My goal, as I was building, was to produce more of a unique artistic piece rather than a kit or item to be sold. 'What really drives me with this hobby is the problem solving aspect of building within the constraints of the Lego system. 'Now that the keyboard is complete I'm much more interested in moving on to other projects than building more of them.'","Jason Allemann used more than 1,500 Lego pieces to create the keyboard .

Moving on: Brynne Edelsten, pictured here with Geoffrey in November 2013, has moved out of the luxury penthouse she once shared with her ex-husband . But it seems Brynne has finally found peace. 'She's moved from the apartment,' her manager Rob Menzies told MailOnline. 'At least she's in the process of moving. I've got nothing else to add.' The 31-year-old buxom blonde officially split with multi-millionaire medical entrepreneur, 70, in January. Palatial: Geoffrey's luxury Melbourne apartment turned into a 'war zone' Life of luxury: The blonde has been staying under the same roof as her ex . Their highly-publicised split was played out in the press across Australia. Their marital apartment was described in Woman's Day earlier this year as a 'virtual war zone' in a published interview with Geoffrey. In a New Idea interview in February Brynne said the divorce had left her so broke she was unable to attend her grandmother's funeral.

"By . Steve Doughty . Current rules, introduced in 2008, say courts should send a shoplifter to jail for no more than six weeks . Shoplifters who ruin small businesses or upset shop staff should be given much tougher punishments, judges and magistrates have been told. Sentencing advisers yesterday called for jail terms for regular offenders who take goods worth only a few pounds. Courts should also get tougher with thieves whose crime upsets or distresses small-business owners or staff responsible for running branches of large chains, they said. New guidelines on how to deal  with thieves also call for stiff new sentencing for those who damage war memorials or put the public in danger by stealing metal. The demand for more serious sentencing follows complaints from business leaders that theft from stores has been treated as a misdemeanour rather than a crime that can smash small businesses and devastate their staff. Senior judges have also said police are too readily letting hardened regular offenders get away with minor on-the-spot fines, which regularly go unpaid. But in 2012 a Cabinet minister said that people who put their rubbish bins out an hour too early should get the same £80 fine as a shoplifter. Rules that apply the same fines to shoplifting and breaking council bin rules remain in force. The new draft guidelines from the Sentencing Council – the judge-dominated body that advises courts on how to punish criminals – said courts should ‘recognise the impact that shop thefts can have’. The new sentencing rules – likely to be in operation by the end of the year – ‘emphasise not only loss of business but also take into account that the size or type of business can make the shop owner particularly hard hit by thieves’. New draft guidelines by the Sentencing Council said courts should 'recognise the impact that shop thefts can have' and said harsher punishments should be given to shoplifters (file picture) Current rules, introduced in 2008, . say courts should send a shoplifter to jail for no more than six weeks, . and only for a crime involving violence, very high levels of planning, . and significant threats or damage. Lesser shoplifting offences attract . fines or community punishments. The . new rules recommend six months in prison for those who steal goods . worth around £500, if they harm a business or upset a shop worker, and . even tougher terms for persistent offenders. As an example, the Sentencing Council said a regular thief who uses a foil-lined bag to steal a DVD box set worth £25 from a supermarket should get three months in jail, even after the court has reduced the punishment for his guilty plea. Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, welcomes the new draft guidelines . For the first time the rules cover bicycle theft. Thieves who take machines worth around £250 should go to prison if they cause great inconvenience or leave the victim feeling intimidated, the guidelines say. T . aking metal plaques from a war memorial or crematorium would be punished as ‘heritage’ theft. The distress to families and the cost of replacing the plaques should mean the culprit is jailed for between  one and four years, the guidelines say. Those who take manhole covers, roof tiles or electric cables would risk strong penalties because of the dangers and inconvenience they cause the public. Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium welcomed the new rules. She said: ‘Theft from stores pushed the direct cost of retail crime up to £511million last year, with the average cost of each theft rising by 62 per cent to £177.' ‘We all pay for this increased stealing through higher prices and, increasingly, shop closures and damage to our town centres.’","Shoplifters should be given much tougher punishments, courts told .

"By . Emma Innes . A new magnetic 'pain zapping' device could transform the lives of migraine sufferers by relieving their pain with the push of a button . A new magnetic ‘pain zapping’ device could transform the lives of migraine sufferers with the push of a button. Many of England's six million migraine sufferers have been offered new hope after Britain's health and care guidance body recommended for use a portable device which sends pulses to the brain. In NHS guidance, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) revealed the encouraging results of clinical trials of the gadget. The controlled trial saw 164 migraine patients treated with single transcranial magnetic stimulation and 39 per cent were pain-free two hours later. One day after the treatment, 29 per cent were still pain free as were 27 per cent after 48 hours. In a separate study, three-quarters of patients with migraine who were treated repeatedly with the transcranial magnetic device had a reduction in headache frequency, even those with chronic migraine. The size and weight of a hair-dryer, the device is held against the back of the head at the first sign of a migraine. At the push of a button it gives out two fleeting bursts of electricity which short-circuit the 'electrical storm' in the brain that causes the splitting pain, flashing lights and blurred vision associated with migraines. Miriam Heyburn, now in her 60s, has suffered from migraine since the age of eight and had headaches every other day, or daily, in recent years. The TMS device has enabled her to go four, five, and occasionally even 10 days, without headaches. Ms Heyburn, of Croydon, south London, said: ‘The device has transformed my life and I don't have to take anywhere near as many tablets.’ Estimates suggest that in Britain there are 190,000 migraine attacks every day and 25 million days are lost from work or school each year as a result. The device may prove appropriate for those who find alternatives ineffective, or unsuitable, such as for people who are pregnant. People interested in trying the device can ask their GP for a referral to a specialist migraine and headache clinic. British migraine sufferers are now able to try the device by asking their GP for a referral to a specialist migraine treatment centre . Wendy Thomas, chief executive of the charity The Migraine Trust, said: ‘Huge numbers of sufferers find their lives blighted by migraine. ‘We welcome NICE guidance that may help deliver brighter futures to many people for whom other treatments have not worked.’ Professor Peter Goadsby, chair of the British Association for the Study of Headache, and director of the National Headache Centre at King's College Hospital in London, said: ‘Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a wonderful example of clinical and laboratory research delivering a real improvement in migraine treatment that is both effective and extremely well tolerated. ‘Many patients are going to get real benefit from this device.’ Consultant neurologist Dr Fayyaz Ahmed, a trustee of The Migraine Trust, added: ‘This is a breakthrough treatment for those who cannot tolerate or do not respond to current treatment, and opens the door for a new era in treating migraine headaches. ‘We welcome NICE guidance and very much hope this treatment is made available to those in need.’","NICE has approved the portable transcranial magnetic device for use .

"By . Chris Paine . Zara Phillips told Mike Tindall he was an 'idiot' when he splashed out on a £12,000 race horse at a charity auction. Now the Queen's granddaughter may find herself eating humble pie her at Saturday's Grand National, where her husband's horse Monbeg Dude is tipped to win. Rugby star Tindall was 'well-oiled', according to his Royal wife, at a Cheltenham auction in 2010 when he bid on the nine-year-old gelding. But four years on the Princess and former . Olympic silver medallist is even helping to train Monbeg Dude, a 14-1 . second favourite with bookmakers that a top mathematician believes will . win the Grand National - according a formula he developed. Part owner Mike Tindall bid for £12,000-horse Monbeg Dude at a charity auction four years ago. Now the nine-year-old gelding is a 14-1 second favourite for the Grand National and the top choice of mathematician William Hartston . 'Idiot': Zara Phillips  and her husband, pictured here together at Cheltenham, disagreed over the choice to buy into the horse . Monbeg Dude is now worth a reported £200,000, after costing just £12,000 . GoggleBox intellectual William Hartston, 66, spent days carefully studying the statistics from every single Grand National which has taken place since 1886. He then used a complex formula which included the bookies' odds, age of the horse, the letters in the owner's name, and the letters and number of words in the horses' names. And he concluded Monbeg, who is trained by Michael Scudamore and will be ridden by top jockey Paul Carberry, has the best chance of winning the race. Hartston said: 'This year's scoring system is based on a re-analysis of the results of all Aintree Grand Nationals since 1886. The man with the plan: William Hartston spent days carefully studying the statistics from every single Grand National which has taken place since 1886 to develop his formula - and he has Monbeg Dude coming out in front . She's warming to him! Zara Phillips even helps to train Monbeg Dude, who has raked in £122,245 in prize money from four race wins . According to a complicated mathematical model, Monbeg Dude is the hot favourite to win the Grand National . Points are awarded from one to four according to six criteria: . The last two items are added together and the sum then halved to give a single figure from 0 to 4 for the trainer's name. The top-scoring horses using this system are as follows (points are then added depending on the odds offered by William Hill): . 'Unlike last year, I have given a weighting towards recent years and added an item relating to the name of the trainer. 'I would have liked to include the name of the jockey too, but in many cases this is not available until the morning of the race. 'Had I been able to do so last year, Seabass would not have been my top choice: no jockey whose first name begins with K has ever won the Grand National, so Katie Walsh stood very little chance. 'Monbeg came top and looks like the best bet as far as I'm concerned. 'I love applying statistical techniques to everyday events. Hartston is a Cambridge-educated mathematician and industrial psychologist who was a chess champion in the 1970s. He . has since become a TV boffin, applying statistics to the Miss Great . Britain competition and is now a regular 'viewer' on Channel 4 show . Gogglebox. After . calculating the points total for Saturday's runners and riders Hartston . studied the odds and favourites with a team of experts from William . Hill. Get in! Rugby player Tindall, who according to his Royal wife was 'well oiled' when he bought into Monbeg Dude, will be hoping for similar joy at this Saturday's race meeting . Monbeg Dude's trainer Michael Scudamore says his team will need a 'bit more luck than just a mathematical formula to ensure a win' The bookies' spokeswoman Kate Miller said: 'Monbeg Dude is the perfect age, level of talent, and stamina to make-up into a first-class Grand National contender. 'With the bookmakers already running scared, the 'perfect storm' of royal and sporting connections- will also ensure a hefty payout to punters if he wins on Saturday. Monbeg Dude's trainer Michael Scudamore isn't quite buying into Hartston's model, preferring to look at his horse's form as a marker for Saturday's meeting. 'It being the Grand National, we're going to need a bit more luck than just a mathematical formula to ensure a win,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Monbeg Dude has earned his connections £122,245, including four race wins, and is now worth a reported £200,000, according to the Daily Star. A 103-year-old believed to be Britain’s oldest punter is hoping for a winner on this year’s Grand National - after betting on the race for more than seven decades without success. George Atkinson said he is hoping to finally have a successful bet on the world-famous race, so he can 'die a happy man'. Mr Atkinson has placed bets religiously on the Grand National each year since the 1940s. George Atkinson, a 103-year-old who is believed to be Britain's oldest punter, is hoping for a winner on this year's Grand National - after betting on the race for more than seven decades without success . That's a lot of birthdays! George says he would 'die a happy man' if he finally wins this year . But he has never managed to back a winner, and fears the 2014 race is his last chance. And after such a long run of betting, he has decided to pin his hopes on 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run, owned by Robert Waley-Cohen and trained by Nicky Henderson. Mr Atkinson said: 'Any winner is nice - but the national would be a dream come true - I could die a happy man.' The 103-year-old, from Swaffham, Norfolk, placed his first bet on the Grand National in the 1940s after leaving the Army. He had placed his first ever bet when he was just 12, when his bookmaker grandfather took him to the Epsom Derby. He said: 'I can’t remember the name as it lost - in fact they all lose. I’ve never even had a place.'I was once told to back Oxo in 1959 but I didn’t place a bet on it - it won and I’ve regretted it for 55 years.' George has pin his hopes on 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run . The Grand National is not the only competition Mr Atkinson has a flutter on - winning £301 from a £1 stake in 2013 by correctly predicting three of the numbers on the Irish Lottery. 'Horses are my favourite, but I love a dog race too,' he said. 'Number seven is my lucky number, but I’m not the luckiest punter.' The widowed father-of-seven, who is a grandfather and great-grandfather, goes to his local branch of bookmaker William Hill in Swaffham twice a day and even celebrated his 103rd birthday there. Believed to be Britain’s oldest punter, the company has given him a £103 bet - £51.50 each way - as he tries to fulfil his dream of a Grand National win. He has decided to put it on Long Run - whose odds of winning are currently at 14/1 - and said: 'It has been a long run without a winner and it feels like my time.' Happy punter: 'Horses are my favourite, but I love a dog race too' William Hill took more than five million bets on the Grand National last year and is expected to accept over £30 million in wagers in 2014. According to the bookmakers, around 57 per cent of Britain’s adult population is expected to place a bet on the Grand National, with 51 per cent of those who bet making their selection based on personal preferences. Based on a survey of 2,066 people conducted for the firm by Populus, 36 per cent of people will choose a horse by name; 17 per cent make their selection by odds; 9 per cent will leave it purely to chance, and make a random selection; and just 2 per cent will pick because of the colours worn by the jockey. Yvonne Dobinson, manager of William Hill Swaffham, said: 'George is living proof of how hard it is to win the Grand National with over 70 years failing to pick a winner. 'But he has picked a corker this year and even we will be cheering Long Run on for his sake.'","Zara Phillips told Mike Tindall he was an 'idiot' for bidding on £12,000 horse at charity auction in 2010 .

"By . Laura Clark . Toughening up: The threshold for a 'good' pass - currently a C - will be brought closer to a B, in line with standards in the world's top education systems. The number of top GCSE grades awarded will be halved in a shake-up  to end an era of soaring pass rates. A new top ‘grade nine’ will go to entrants who show ‘really exceptional’ performance – half the number who achieve an A* in the present system. A greater range of lower grades will make it easier for employers and colleges to distinguish between middle and top-performing school-leavers. The threshold for a ‘good’ GCSE pass – currently a grade C – will be brought closer to a B, in line with standards in the world’s highest-achieving education systems. Improvements in grading techniques will also help examiners end grade inflation. The plans – published today by qualifications regulator Ofqual – are part of sweeping reforms to public exams instigated by Education Secretary Michael Gove. They will affect maths and English GCSEs awarded in 2017 and several other key subjects the following year. Ofqual confirmed that alphabetic grades A* to G will be replaced by numbers, with nine being the highest. Chief executive Glenys Stacey said the reforms would restore public confidence in GCSEs, after years of concern over numbers of A grades, dumbed down content and repeated resits. A Department for Education source said: ‘Rising results, year after year, masked the fact that standards were stagnating. In future the top grade will be awarded only for top performance. ‘We hope these reforms will raise standards and restore trust in the exam system for families, for employers and for the pupils themselves.’ Under the proposals, entrants will find it tougher to achieve the top grades and more will end up  with the existing ‘U’ for fail. The current top two grades – A and A* – will be replaced with three in the new system – seven, eight and nine, with nine going to only about one in 30 pupils – half those who gain A*s under the current system. Of those who passed nearly 7 per cent of exams at A* in England last year, only 3 to 4 per cent would have merited the new grade. ‘This would make the standard of performance required for the award of a grade nine really exceptional,’ the department source said. Mastermind: The plans are part of sweeping exams reforms instigated by Education Secretary Michael Gove and will affect maths and English GCSEs awarded in 2017 and several other key subjects the following year . The numerical GCSE grading scale will be familiar to many as the system once used to grade O-levels. But under the Gove system a nine will be the highest grade, whereas a nine at O-level was the lowest. Before 1975, pass grades at O-level were numbered one to six, with grades seven to nine considered a fail. Schools were told the number, but grades were officially recorded as pass or fail only. Five official grades – the letters A to E – were introduced in 1975, with A to C classed as a pass  and D and E fail grades. In 1965 the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) was brought in alongside O-level GCE chiefly for lower-achieving pupils at secondary moderns. O-levels and CSEs were replaced by GCSEs in the late 1980s. The current C grade will be equivalent to grade four but will no longer be seen as the benchmark for GCSE achievement. Instead, grade five – which will be pitched up to two-thirds of a grade higher than C – will be the new de facto ‘pass’. Ofqual said grade five would be pegged to standards in high-performing countries and regions such as Singapore, Shanghai, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands. Changes to GCSEs already confirmed include an end to modular tests in most subjects, with traditional end-of-course exams becoming the ‘default method of assessment’ – to stop pupils entering early or multiple times in the hope of eventually gaining a good grade. ‘Controlled assessments’ – coursework done in class – will be minimised amid concerns  that teachers were able to massage results. In a further proposal, a sample of pupils each year – possibly several thousand – would sit an English and maths test just before their GCSEs to help examiners ensure grade-setting is robust and accurate and to limit grade inflation.","Greater range of grades will distinguish between middle and top performers .

"By . Ray Massey . Britain is facing a growing £12billion bill to fix the nation’s potholes - made worse by the record rainfall and flooding this winter, a report reveals today. It says the ‘catch-up’ cost of getting local roads back to a reasonable state has now soared by £1.5billion in a single year because of the deluge. And that is despite extra cash and effort to fill more than two million potholes across England and Wales over the last 12 months. Britain is facing a growing £12billion bill to fix the nation's potholes - made worse by the record rainfall and flooding this winter, a report reveals today . Compensation claims for car damage and injury caused by potholed or badly maintained roads now cost taxpayers £32 million a year and have soared by nearly 20 per cent in England and by 66 per cent in Wales. It would now take 12 years to clear the road repair backlog in England and Wales and 14 years in London, says the Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (ALARM) survey carried out by the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA). Motoring groups said it was time to end the ‘sticking plaster’ and ‘patch and mend’ approach. Councils in England said the cost of restoring roads to a reasonable condition had risen 30per cent since last year to an average of £90million per authority. In his Budget last month, Chancellor George Osborne announced an extra £200million to repair potholes in 2014-15 . And Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced £183.5million emergency funding to help with road repairs following ‘the wettest winter on record’. He said the cash would pay for the repair of 3.3million potholes. But motoring groups said this was ‘a sticking plaster not a cure’. It would now take 12 years to clear the road repair backlog in England and Wales and 14 years in London, says the Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (ALARM) survey carried out by the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA) The AIA said the record winter rainfall had undone much of the pothole work done over the last 12 months with up to two thirds (65per cent) of local authorities in England affected by the winter deluge. Compensation claims for personal injury or damage to vehicles has increased by nearly 20 per cent over the last year to an average of 540 per local authority in England - up from 452 last year. This excludes London where the figures remain the same at 126 per authority. But in Wales claims have shot up by 66 per cent to 141 per council - up from 80 last year. The total cost of compensation claims . caused by poor road condition across England and Wales over the last . year topped £31.6million, of which £16.6million was for claim pay-outs . to motorists and other road users with the remaining £15million - up . from £13million the previous year - caused by the rising council . staff-costs of processing the claims. AIA . chairman Alan Mackenzie said the figures were ‘disappointing’ for . everyone who has worked to improve the roads: ‘To see that work washed . away is discouraging to say the least.’ RAC technical director David Bizley said it was ‘no great surprise’ that the catch up cost of getting roads in order had risen. And . AA president Edmund King said voters should take note: ‘It is . unacceptable that each winter, whether it is frost or rain, our roads . are crumbling and give way too easily. Bad surfaces with millions of . potholes can cause death and injury especially to those on two wheels . and lead to expensive damage and insurance claims.’ Compensation claims for car damage and injury caused by potholed or badly maintained roads now cost taxpayers £32 million a year . The Local Government Association said the country was facing a 'roads crisis escalating at an alarming pace'. Peter Box, chairman of the LGA’s economy and transport board, said: 'Councils have long warned that our already dilapidated road network could not cope with another extreme winter and the unprecedented recent flooding experienced across the country has left behind a trail of destruction to our highways.' The Government’s promised extra funding was welcome 'but it is simply not enough to free councils trapped in an endless cycle of only being able to patch up our deteriorating network. This will always be more expensive than longer-term preventative work,' he added. ‘This country is now facing a roads crisis escalating at an alarming pace with every bout of severe weather and following years of underfunding.’ He noted: ‘Our roads are now in such disrepair that it will take more than a decade and £12billion to bring them up to scratch.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said it had increased funding by more than 27 per cent this parliament 'to help councils tackle potholes', adding: 'We are providing councils in England with more than £10billion from 2010 to 2021 for local highway maintenance'. This includes an extra £183.5million 'specifically to help areas damaged by bad weather this winter.' The spokesman said: ''This long-term funding will help councils maintain their roads effectively.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Paris Jackson and her brother Prince Michael have spoken out publicly a number of times since their father died but now their youngest brother Blanket has joined them. Blanket, who is now 11 years old, took part in a pay-per-view documentary called Remembering Our Michael that their grandmother Katherine Jackson created for paying fans, which promises to give some of Jackson's biggest supporters a glimpse of the children talking about their father. During his segments, Blanket described his passion for animals which stems from his early life surrounded by exotic creatures at Neverland Ranch. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . His father's legacy: Prince Michael II, known by his nickname Blanket, spoke about how his early introduction to exotic animals prompted his interest in Africa and endangered species . 'We lived in kind of like a zoo basically- (there were) giraffes, lions,' Blanket said. 'You probably heard of it but yeah we had a chimp named Bubbles,' he said of the singer's famous chimpanzee. That exposure to African animals has apparently prompted an interest in their homeland as he apparently wants to help put an end to poaching. 'I just want to help Africa because that's a very poor continent,' Blanket said. The last time we saw him: Blanket kept his face covered at his father's 2009 funeral . 'There's a lot of animals being killed by poachers and stuff so I want to help endangered species of animals.' Michael's father estranged father Joe . Jackson was included in the documentary. Michael had spoken out about . how his father abused him as a child and would regularly whip him during . rehearsals, though he credited that incessant work ethic as the reason . why he was so successful. Now Joe appears to have his eyes set . on another member of the Jackson family as being bound for stardom, . saying in the documentary that he was told by a fortune teller that . Blanket is bound for greatness. 'They said there would never be . another Michael Jackson and I say we already have one. I said he just . has to be trained. That kid is the spitting image of Michael when he was . smaller,' Joe Jackson said. Tuning in remotely: Paris Jackson (left) is now living at a therapeutic boarding school in Utah after being hospitalized following a suicide attempt two years after her father's death. Prince (right) is now 16-years-old . The wedding: Michael Jackson married his nurse Debbie Rowe when she was six months pregnant with his son Prince Michael I (seen here at their 1996 wedding), and the couple went on to have daughter Paris a year later . '(The fortune teller) said that boy there is going to be the biggest entertainer in the world.' Blanket has expressed an interest in his father's career path, recalling how he had an early interest in his dad's skills. Bizarre: The promotional poster for the documentary shows Michael serving his children pancakes- while their chimp Bubbles looks in from the window . 'Sometimes I would go in his room and watch videos of him dancing,' Blanket said. His older sister Paris acknowledged that their unusual upbringing may have had it's own set of drawbacks. 'We didn't know a lot of kids our age. We were more secluded, we never really left the ranch that often,' she . said of their life before Michael's 2009 death. She defended his decision to keep the children in a world of their own, saying: 'There are a lot of bad people out there ... (but he) always wanted a taste normal life.' Paris has had the most trouble publicly since her father's death, as she was hospitalized following a suicide attempt when she slit her wrist and took pills. She has since reunited with her biological mother, Debbie Rowe, who said that Paris was having trouble connecting with her younger brother and her grandmother following Michael's death. Paris is currently getting treatment at a therapeutic boarding school in Utah, though she was still able to participate in the making of the documentary. 'He promised he would teach me how to moonwalk- never got around to it,' she said of her father's signature dance move. 'I really hope his legacy lives on forever. I will never forget him ever. He was amazing.' Prince Michael is Jackson's eldest son with Rowe, who he met because she worked as his dermatologist's assistant. Rowe and Jackson married when she was six months pregnant with Prince, and they went on to have Paris a year later. The couple split a year later and Jackson was awarded full custody of the children. Concern: Blanket said that he wants to help stop the damage done by poachers in Africa . Animal lover: Michael made headlines when he bought 'Bubbles' the chimpanzee in 1987 . In 2002, Blanket was born via artificial insemination and his surrogate mother's identity remains a secret. Prince Michael, who is now 16, spoke the most lovingly about his father, saying that he had no idea who his father really was until he was about six years old because he just knew him as daddy. 'He wanted us to always be what we wanted to be, just be greater at it than anyone else had ever been,' Prince Michael said.

"By . Steve Doughty . Marriage and family are the route to happiness for the middle-aged, a study claims. It found that a traditional lifestyle and the responsibility of bringing up children count for much more than money in making a satisfied life. Married couples maintained their levels of happiness last year at a time when satisfaction generally declined among the over-50s. Happiness in the over-50s declined in general last year, according to a survey, but married couples maintained their levels of satisfaction and those with children had the highest rate of all . They are more than twice as content with their lives as single people, the study suggested. The benefits of a stable family and steady employment – though not necessarily well-paid employment – are revealed in the RIAS Over-50s Satisfaction Index, based on a series of surveys combined with official statistics. People over 50 are less happy than they were last year, with the level of the index dropping  2 per cent, from 6.92 out of ten to 6.81, thanks to falling emotional and financial satisfaction. But 39 per cent of over-50s scored more than seven out of ten, and were classed as ‘truly satisfied’. Satisfaction with finances was down 10 per cent, an indication of the continuing effect of the recession, rising retirement ages and falling retirement incomes, the study said. The results of the study were gathered before last month’s Budget and Chancellor George Osborne’s moves to free retirees from having to spend their pension pots on annuities of questionable value. However, wealth did not figure as the main reason why people said they were happy. The study found the most satisfied people are on modest earnings between £17,000 and £23,000, and only people with less than £10,000 were likely to show up as unhappy in the index. Emotional satisfaction dropped by 17 per cent, believed to be due to the increase in numbers of divorces among older people. While levels of divorce have fallen steadily, divorces among the middle-aged have been defying the trend by rising. Figures show that among  married men over 60, 2.3 in every 1,000 were divorced in 2011  compared with only 1.6 in every 1,000 in 1991. The study found that 46 per cent of married people were happy with their lives, compared with 22 per cent of single people. It also said that people are happier in their 70s than in their 50s. The most satisfied group of people, it said, are in their 70s, married, retired, have children who are financially independent and feel they have achieved their ambitions, but can still adapt to new challenges. Feeling miserable? Then you most likely live in Northern Ireland, are single, have no children, work full-time and earn less than £10,000 . Peter Corfield of insurance provider RIAS said: ‘Overall, the UK’s over-50s are currently satisfied. However, there is no denying that satisfaction is in decline. ‘As expected, money doesn’t buy happiness; the index clearly shows that love, family and emotional happiness are the key long-term drivers of satisfaction. It also helps to live in the South West, the report said. But in contrast, the most miserable middle-aged are in their 50s, are single without children, work full-time for less than £10,000 a year, and live in Northern Ireland. The index also shows ‘satisfied 70s’ are miles ahead of their 50s counterparts, suggesting we need to re-evaluate how we view happiness in relation to age and money. For many over-50s, satisfaction comes from protecting the people and things they love. ‘Key drivers for over-50s satisfaction are the feeling of control, emotional happiness, satisfaction with time spent working and the contribution that they are making to society,’ the  report said. ‘Money is the least important driver for satisfaction. ‘Those Britons living a traditional lifestyle – married with children, fully retired – are the most satisfied overall.’","Happiness fell in over-50s last year except in married couples .
Survey found most satisfied had income between £17,000 and £23,000 .
Happiest were retired couples with independent children in South East .
Most miserable were Northern Ireland singletons without children ."

"By . Katy Winter . A team of 16 talented bakers have completed the Great British Bug Off - aiming to create a jungle made of cake. The dung beetles look worthy of a Bushtucker Trial but they are all edible creations made from cake, icing and gelatine. Even the flowers and branches that they are perched on are edible delicacies created by baker Vicki Smith, 26, from Flintshire, and her colleagues. The individual bakes come together to form an unbelievably realistic and detailed (and totally edible!) jungle, which will be exhibited at The Cake and Bake Show 2014 this weekend . While this cut-in-half bug may not look particularly appetizing, it is in fact crafted out of a variety of delicious sweet materials . The group of 16 of the most talented bakers across the UK and the US have created a jungle made entirely of cake which includes realistic Dung beetles which don't look out of place next to real leaves . They have been created after thousands of hours of painstaking work for an event in Manchester this weekend. Each . dung beetle, no more than four inches long, took days to complete, . while some of the more complicated items took even longer. They . will be part of a display featuring at least a dozen beetles as well as . flowers, branches and even a leopard cub, although the leopard has not . yet been completed.

'They didn’t . want just anyone, they wanted people who had talent, and that we are but . we all have our strengths so we used that to our advantage. 'They . approached me a few months back so it’s been hard catching up to . everyone but I’ve made bugs for a photo shoot for the cake and bake . promo.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A report on the corrupt use of British aid money in developing countries has been watered down to remove nearly all of the allegations, an investigation found today. The alleged misappropriation of tens of thousands of pounds was discovered by investigators working for the Global Fund, into which the UK government recently pledged £1billion. However, a leaked internal document has reportedly revealed how all but one of the original accusations had been removed from the official report. Global Fund said only 'evidence that can be confirmed as fact' was included in the final version. Cover-up? An official report looking at corruption in projects funded by the Global Fund in Cambodia (above, file picture) had erased all but one of the original allegations against a non-profit organisation . They include claims relating to money sent by a British charity working on behalf of the UK government to a non-profit group accused of double billing for staff and computers. Medicam was also accused of charging more than £61,000 for consultants who were never employed, submitting bills for hotels that were never used and falsifying documents on the office computer of its director, Dr Sin Sumony. The allegations were reportedly contained in an earlier draft from within the fund, seen by the BBC's Panorama programme. But the final report looking at corruption in Cambodia contained just one of the four allegations when it was published two weeks ago. Bea Edwards, from the Government . Accountability Project in Washington, told the BBC: 'The fact that a . report is suppressed for almost a year and then is somewhat less . detailed than the original version, that is a cover-up. Saving lives: The Geneva-based Global Fund is backed by governments and private donors such as rock star Bono (left) and Microsoft founder Bill Gates . The Global Fund says it is 'transparent and has zero tolerance of corruption' and that only 'evidence that can be confirmed as fact is included in the final version'. Dr Sumony, who sits on the Global Fund committee that oversees its projects in Cambodia, said: 'Number one, we did not commit that corruption. 'Number two, through the Global Fund support, their financial management system has improved.' He confirmed the group was due to receive more than $720,000 (£440,000) from the fund this year. Panorama also claims to have uncovered a separate unpublished report by Global Fund into an alleged scam in Burkina Faso involving an £8.3million contract that possibly left two million people more at risk of contracting malaria. The leaked document, which was completed a year ago but has still not been published, reportedly shows that a company took the money and then bought cheaper mosquito nets from China that had not been properly treated with insecticide. The Global Fund said the nets did give protection, but had distributed replacements. Over the last ten years, the Geneva-based body, which is backed by governments and private donors such as Microsoft founder Bill Gates and rock star Bono, has spent £13.5billion fighting malaria, Aids and tuberculosis around the world.","Allegations involving British cash uncovered by Global Fund investigators .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . UKIP is harvesting thousands of votes from the BNP, Nigel Farage boasted yesterday. He said his anti-EU agenda and tough line on immigration was proving increasingly attractive to supporters of the far-Right party, and had already persuaded a third of them to switch their allegiance. The Ukip leader insisted he had ‘no truck’ with the BNP’s ‘racist agenda’ and said he was ‘proud’ to be attracting its voters. Speaking at an event at Chatham House, in London, he said: ‘We are saying to BNP voters, if you are voting BNP because you are frustrated, upset with the change in your community but you are doing it holding your nose, because you don’t agree with their racist agenda, come and vote for us. ‘I would think that we have probably taken a third of the BNP vote directly from them.’ BNP candidates secured 940,000 votes in the European elections in 2009, but the party’s support has slumped since then. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said no one had done more than him to tackle the BNP . Mr Farage’s comments came as Nick . Clegg claimed Ukip exploited the same ‘politics of blame’ as France’s . far-Right National Front, which inflicted heavy defeats on the ruling . socialists in local elections at the weekend. The . Lib Dem leader said both parties were feeding off a ‘profound sense of . anxiety and insecurity’ created by the financial crisis. ‘It . is understandable that when politicians who come along in different . guises and say to people, all your problems can go away, just blame . someone else – blame foreigners, blame immigrants, blame Brussels – that . politics of blame becomes very appealing,’ he said. ‘But however . appealing that might be it isn’t an answer to the modern world... you . can’t turn the clock back to the 1950s.’ Nick Griffin's BNP won two seats in the 2009 European elections, but has lost support since . The . Deputy Prime Minister also criticised Mr Farage for praising Vladimir . Putin’s ‘brilliant’ handling of the civil war in Syria. In an interview with GQ magazine, published yesterday, the Ukip leader was asked which world leader he most admired. He . replied: ‘As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say Putin. The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant. Not that I approve . of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?’ Speaking . at a Westminster press conference, Mr Clegg said: ‘I think it is . utterly grotesque that Nigel Farage apparently admires someone, Vladimir . Putin, who has been the chief sponsor and protector of one of the most . brutal dictators on the planet, President Assad.’","Nigel Farage says no-one has done more to whittle away at BNP's support .

"By . David Kent . The new United States away kit for the World Cup in Brazil has caused uproar among fans, with critics comparing the shirts to the French flag. Designed by Nike, the jersey features three different-colored bands, starting at the top with blue, white, and red to represent the American flag, according to a company press release. The away kit also includes red shorts and red socks. However, fans have taken to Twitter to express their disapproval -- and many are comparing the new jerseys to the French flag, as well as those of the Netherlands and Russia. VIDEO Scroll down for USA highlights vs Mexico in the new kit . New threads: Clint Dempsey models the new USA away kit, which some have compared to both the French flag and even popsicles . Eye sore?The jersey's color scheme has caused outrage and confusion among fans . Patriotic: Former USA international Alexi Lalas looks happy to wear the new away kit . Not the response expected: Fans on Twitter have questioned whether the new USA away strip released by Nike was an April Fool's Day joke . 'Is this April Fool's? Trying to look like France?' one user wrote. 'Away US soccer kit is alright but reminds me of France, Russia, Dutch. Not American and neither is that lighter blue! #USMNT' another tweeted. 'The new #usmnt jersey is basically the flag of France upside down...way to screw it up Nike,' one said. 'Wanna see the new #USMNT jerseys?  Google ""Netherlands Flag""' another user wrote. The famed French flag features panels of blue, white, and red going from left to right. The Dutch flag, however, features panels of red, white and blue going from top to bottom. The new away jersey has even been compared by USA Today to frozen popsicles. Despite the bad reception the kit received from fans, captain Clint Dempsey is a fan of the shirt. Spot the difference: Striker Sydney Leroux sports the new away kit...but does she resemble a Triple Rocket? Man mountain: NFL player Ndamukong Suh models the jersey to lend his support . 'I like the patriotic design and color scheme and I think it will look great on the pitch,' Dempsey said.  'Hopefully they will serve us well as we head into a competitive group.' USA will need all the help they can get after being drawn in the same World Cup group as Ghana, Germany and Portugal. Women's team striker Sydney Leroux was also supportive of the design. 'The new kits fit really well, look great and most importantly, are really comfortable, especially when we are running all over the field for 90 minutes in all sorts of different weather,' Stryker said. See any similarities? Both the French (left) and Dutch (right) away jerseys look different from the new USA away shirt . Russian style: Russia's flag has been compared to the new USA away strip but does not appear to have much of a likeness . Despite fans' objections, the away jerseys for three nations will look different from the ones for the USA. The French away jersey is white with light gray stripes. The Dutch away jersey will be blue with an orange Netherlands badge. Both teams' jerseys are also designed by Nike. The Russian away jersey, designed by Adidas, features an outline of the earth, which looks like a series of blue stripes.

"By . Ashley Pearson . The headlines trumpeted the alarming news this week 'Births to mums over 50 soaring!' I had three radio stations call me before 9 am - despite being almost a decade younger, it seems I'm becoming something of a figurehead for the distasteful trend of the older mum. And unless you were living under a rock this week, you will be familiar with new statistics indicating that the number of women over 50 having babies has more than doubled in the past five years. Ashley Pearson is sick of hearing people criticise women who become first time mums over 50 . It's still only 154 births in the entire nation in a year so it's not like it's COMMON, but still it clearly upsets people. Indeed, naturally, just below the headline, even before you got the article were 'helpful' bullet points on all the dangers of this distressing phenomenon. It was like they were reporting on an outbreak of some new deadly strain of swine flu. 'Older mums are more at risk of miscarriage!' 'Babies born to older mums are more at risk of genetic health problems!' 'This Will Cause a Tremendous Strain on the NHS.' And you know what? That's really what this is all about. I had an email from a friend in New York following one of my many articles in defense of the older mother - and she reiterated something that I know to be true. Star of Shameless, Tina Malone, recently gave birth to her daughter, Flame, at the age of 50 . As an older mum herself, she wrote, 'This just doesn't happen this way in America. They are really positive about the whole subject here. It's like ""if you can do it, good for you!"" They seem to really go after the 40 years and older mom in the UK. I don't understand it.' I'm starting to think that I do. In the US, if a woman becomes a mother in her 40s and requires more care, a higher risk of caesarean section,  and a few extra scans it's a cost, at least up until now, handled by her insurance company. Here, it's bourne by the UK tax payer. And let's face it, no one wants to pay for your decision to leave it 'too late.' To this, I would like to say a few things. Ashley says that American attitudes towards older mothers are completely different to those in the UK . I don't want to pay for your lung cancer after you chose to smoke, or your diabetes medication after you chose to eat poorly for 20 years. I don't wish to pay for the seven children you conceived but cannot financially support, or the cigarettes and alcohol you spend benefit money on. I don't want to support your lifestyle when you claim you are too depressed to find a job, or pay for your subsidised housing when your children harass the neighbours. But that's just me. In any case, I don't get actually get a choice in the matter. And even more significantly, what I wish people would understand is that the vast majority of these 'older mums' are not in this category by choice. Are they really a brigade of selfish, career-obsessed women too fussy in their choice of partners and too focused on personal freedoms to adequately address their declining fertile years? You may think so - but I can assure you, they are not. The vast majority of women in this group are those who waited until they could financially support a child, as well as making sure they had a supportive and appropriate partner. Which in today's world can often feel impossible and is certainly harder than it sounds. Of course there will be challenges being an older mum - both physically and emotionally. Anyone who says that 40 or 50 is an ideal time to have a baby should have their head examined. Biologically ideal is probably around 16 years old - in every other way it's probably closer to 30 - but the reality is, many of us just don't get to choose. For the women out there who read this latest study and felt judged, let me say this, again:  Don't let the haters get you down. Live your life, Find love where you can, and Do what you have to do if motherhood is important to you. Don't let anyone critique your choices, because simply put, they clearly haven't walked a mile in your middle-aged shoes.","Ashley Pearson shocked by the lack of support for 50-plus mums in the UK .

"By . Margot Peppers . Angelina Jolie is teaming up with Stella McCartney to design a children's clothing line inspired by her upcoming Disney movie Maleficent. According to WWD, the collection will feature sparkly princess dresses and sandals for girls and 'edgy T-shirts and sneakers' for boys, with prices ranging from $75 to $185. No doubt the 38-year-old actress had her own children in mind - three of whom will have cameos in the film - when she decided to launch the clothing line, which is aimed at kids aged four to 14. Scroll down for video . Fairy tale fashion: Angelina Jolie is teaming up with Stella McCartney to design a children's clothing line inspired by her upcoming Disney movie Maleficent . Cool kids: The collection will feature sparkly princess dresses and sandals for girls and 'edgy T-shirts and sneakers' for boys, with prices ranging from $75 to $185 . One adorable look from the line is a purple leopard print dress, modeled by a young girl who pairs it with matching purple horns akin to the ones Ms Jolie dons in the movie trailer. Another ensemble, this time geared towards boys, includes a white and grey shirt with a drawing of a dragon. It's unclear whether the boy's grey wings and black horns will also be part of the collection. The clothes will be available in Stella McCartney stores worldwide as well as Disney stores and online at the end of April - a month before the release of the movie on May 30. This isn't Ms McCartney's first foray into Disney-themed fashion; in 2010, the designer created a jewelry collection for Disney inspired by Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. Family ties: No doubt the actress had her own children in mind - three of whom will have cameos in the film - when she decided to launch the line, which will be geared towards four- to 14-year-olds . And in 2009, she featured some characters from Bambi in an ad campaign, including the fawn himself and Thumper the rabbit. 'I've always been a huge fan of Disney growing up, as was my mother, and . I grew up watching all the films like most kids did,' explained Ms McCartney. 'When the opportunity presented itself and I was invited by Angelina Jolie to visit the film set, I jumped at the chance.'

Childhood favorite: 'I've always been a huge fan of Disney growing up, as was my mother, and I grew up watching all the films like most kids did,' explained Ms McCartney . Ms Jolie has revealed in the past that she and Brad Pitt don't want their children to be actors, but that having her five-year-old daughter Vivienne co-star with her in Maleficent was something of a last resort.

"By . Martha Cliff . A terminally ill mother of two is urging all mums to do regular checks on their breasts for signs of cancer. Zoe McIvor, 35, from Eastbourne was told that she could have just months to live after she was diagnosed with cancer in both of her breasts and lungs. Zoe was initially diagnosed in December 2012 with breast cancer after discovering a 17cm malignant tumour. Zoe McIvor, 35, has been given less than six months to live following her diagnosis of breast cancer . She had chemotherapy, surgery and . then radiotherapy but two weeks ago doctors told her the cancer was back . in both her breasts as well as her lungs, and that it is incurable. Zoe says that although doctors have said she may have several years left to live, she isn't confident that she will live that long. 'The doctor told me . timescale-wise I could have between six months and a couple of years to . live - but didn’t sound convinced.' Following this devastating news Zoe is urging mothers to be more vigilant when checking their breasts for any signs of abnormailities. She said: 'I want women to check their breasts over and over and over again. 'If you find anything go to the doctor. It could be a sign of something more. 'I feel I should wear a sandwich board - Check your breasts.' Zoe, pictured here with her daughters - Keira Charley (left) and Millie McIvor (right) - is urging mums everywhere to check their breasts in order to avoid her same tragic fate .

Zoe is putting on a brave face for the girls but is worried about leaving them behind without a mother which is why she is urging other mothers to do regular checks in order to avoid such a tragic fate. Despite the devastating news, she is trying not to let her illness get in the way of her last few months with her daughters. 'We are going to shows and doing fun things.' Zoe is aiming to keep her memory alive for her girls by creating some rather unique and personal mementos. The single mum is dedicating as much times as possible to creating memory boxes for her two children including jewellery imprinted with her thumb print so that the girls will have a permanent memory of their mother. Zoe says that although she dreads not being in her children's lives, she hopes that the memory box will bring some comfort to them. 'I can’t think about not having them in my life or me not being in their lives. But I am making memory boxes for them.' 'I am putting special things in the memory boxes - photographs and ticket stubs, as well as the jewellery.'Zoe, who worked with children in care before she became ill, has been honest with her daughters about her illness and they are fully aware that their mother may not be with them for much longer. 'It’s terminal. I know that. My daughters know. They know tablets won’t take it away.' Zoe's friends organised a party to celebrate her life on Thursday at Carousel’s on Brighton's seafront, and they all took ‘no make-up selfies’ to raise money for cancer charities.","Zoe McIvor, 35, has been could have as little as six months to live .

"By . Katy Winter . A woman lost more than seven stone and transformed herself into a beauty while recovering from a devastating collision which left her toothless and unable to walk. Tindy Chaggar, 38, battled back from her deathbed and is now enjoying a new lease of life as a model, actor and radio presenter. While working as a trainee solicitor Miss Chaggar was hospitalised for three months after she was struck by a van while walking to work in Canary Wharf in London. Tindy now weighs 9.5st and is size 10 (left) following her recovery from the crash; pictured right, at 17st before her weight loss . Tindy pictured before the collision while she was overweight; she lost more than seven stone while recovering from a devastating accident which left her toothless and unable to walk . She sustained a punctured lung, a severely broken leg and a ruptured aorta. In the immediate aftermath of the smash, doctors warned her family that she might not survive. Miss Chaggar, of Leicester, said: 'The accident was devastating. I experienced permanent memory loss, meaning I had to give up on my career. I was feeling extremely depressed. 'I desperately needed something new to drive me, otherwise I would have just given up on life. Transforming my figure was something to focus on.' Miss Chaggar had been overweight during her adolescence and years of rushed business lunches had left her keen to shrink her waistline. Tindy (pictured here while recovering from the accident surrounded by her family) suffered a punctured lung, a severely broken leg and a ruptured aorta in the crash, spending three months in hospital . Tindy pictured in the wake of the collision which caused damage to her teeth . She said: 'I was always plump and certainly not sexy, but it didn’t bother me. 'I thought of myself as the one with the brains instead, and for years I was happy with putting myself in that box. Then when I reached my late 20s I decided I wanted what every other girl does - a great wardrobe and an enviable figure. 'I’d started to transform myself by going to the gym and dieting, and was feeling much better about myself. 'But then the accident happened, and instead of battling to drop the pounds I found myself fighting to even survive.' The van struck her with such force that she was catapulted more than 40 metres down the road. She was airlifted to hospital for emergency treatment while her family were called down from Leicester for a bedside vigil. After multiple operations to repair her broken bones, damaged insides, and shattered teeth, Miss Chaggar underwent hours of gruelling physiotherapy to get back on her feet. She rose to the challenge, but her normal life was far out of reach. Left virtually immobile in the hospital, her weight crept up to 17st. Tindy (pictured right following her 7st weight loss) says it is only when she looks back at pictures of herself, such as the snap on the left, that she realises how large she used to be . She said: 'Before the accident I’d had a taste of what it was like to be fit and healthy, and I decided I still wanted that. 'At size 22, I was bigger than I’d ever been. So as soon as I was able to, I started pushing myself. 'The medical staff thought I would never be able to do it, but I remember willing myself on to prove them wrong. 'At one point doctors had even considered amputating my damaged right calf. 'Thankfully they didn’t have to, but it shocked me to realise I didn’t just want to use my leg to walk, I wanted to run.' Incredibly, in the months after the collision in September 2003 Miss Chaggar started regular gym visits, and swapped the fast food of her previous life for healthier, more nutritious options. Slowly but surely her waist line started to shrink. In 2011 she had an abdominoplasty to remove the folds of excess skin her weight loss success had left behind, paid for by a loan. And last year she reached a new milestone - she now weighs 9st 7lbs stone and wears a size 10. She has recently begun modelling and has launched a career in the media. Tinday says she has never been more confident and has even launched a new career in media . She said: 'I have so much more confidence now. I’m not perfect, but I feel on top of the world. 'I love clothes shopping and I’m really into make-up too. It’s only looking back through the photographs that I realise how large I actually was. 'But it’s not all about the exterior, the most important thing to me is my health. 'I’m a total gym addict, and although I still suffer from after effects from the accident I don’t let obstacles get in my way. For example, I can’t use the treadmill because my balance is off, so instead I use the cross trainer. 'I believe the only reason I survived the accident is because I’d started going to the gym so my heart was stronger. 'It taught me life is precious, so I want to be as fit and healthy as possible to enjoy every moment. 'My fantastic new figure is just a very welcome bonus.'","Tindy was hit by a van on the way to work and thrown 40ft .

"Princess Eugenie has flown back from America to revisit the hospital where she underwent spinal surgery at age 12. Reflecting the spring weather, Princess Eugenie wore bright turquoise to open the new Children's High Dependency Unit at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital today. She underwent an eight hour surgery in 2002 to correct scoliosis and is now a patron of the hospital's charity redevelopment appeal, which has helped fund the new unit. Princess Eugenie, pictured with Professor Anthony Goldstone, unveiling the plaque marking the official opening of the new High Dependency Unit at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital . Princess Eugenie chose a bright outfit to match the sunshine for the visit, emphasising her slim figure with a cinched in waist . The princess met  Caitlin Kydd (12 year old Sarcoma patient) and her parents Jake and Alison Kydd . During the visit, Eugenie unveiled a plaque to officially open the new unit, watched by Professor Anthony Goldstone, hospital officials and patients, before touring the wards and meeting patients. Having been admitted to the hospital herself, Eugenie could easily emphasise with the children currently undergoing treatment, talking in depth and sharing hugs with patients and their families. Eugenie’s major surgery at 12 meant she needed to spend three days in intensive care at the hospital. Having been admitted to the hospital herself, Eugenie could easily emphasise with the children currently undergoing treatment . Princess Eugenie chats to patient Chloe Golding and her mother Marie Golding during her visit to the hospital, where she herself was admitted as a child . The new unit, which will treat over 400 children a year, will allow parents to sleep next to their children, something not possible at the time of Eugenie’s operation. While the young princess went on to make a complete recovery, the experience has clearly stayed with her. Speaking at the event, the Express reports Eugenie said: ‘Going into hospital is nerve-wracking for any child; I can still vividly remember how nervous I felt in the days and weeks leading up to my operation. ‘Anything that can be done to ease these worries and make the environment better for patients is to be welcomed. The princess spoke of memories of her own surgery, saying she was nervous for weeks beforehand . Eugenie spent time after opening the unit looking around and talking to patients such as Caitlin Kydd (pictured left) The princess flew back from New York, where she is working at an auction house, sometime last week to open the unit . ‘This purpose-built unit will enable specialist teams to concentrate on improving the condition of their patients so that they can return to the ward after their operation as soon as possible. ‘I am sure it will greatly enhance the care and experience of the hospital’s young patients and their families.’ The 24-year-old princess is believed to have returned to the UK some time in the last week for the visit from New York where she is working for the online auction company Paddle8. Showing no signs of jet lag, Eugenie looked glowing in her sleeveless summer dress, pulled in with a  tribal print belt. She completed the elegant look with a pair of nude high heels. Just last week the princess attended The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson and her daughter attended the Gavel & Grand Benefit Auction at the glamourous Bowery Hotel.","Eugenie had an eight-hour operation aged 12 to correct scoliosis in 2002 .

"By . Emma Innes . A little boy suffers from an extremely rare condition which means his body is covered in painful blisters. Geraint Burns, from Neath, South Wales, has such delicate skin that it erupts in agonising blisters if he gets too warm or gets rubbed or knocked. The 18-month-old baby’s skin is so red and sore that worried strangers will question whether he has been burnt - forcing his mother, Angharard, to hand out leaflets explaining his condition. Geraint Burns (pictured with his mother, Angharard), 18 months old, from South Wales, has an extremely rare skin condition which means he develops blisters at the slightest touch . Ms Burns, 27, said: ‘It’s frightening how many people just assume his skin is a result of something I have done wrong. ‘I’ve even made cards that I hand out to people who stare at us in the street to educate them about the condition. ‘Geraint reacts really badly to changes in temperatures so I have to be extremely careful when we go out. ‘I have to leave his top off sometimes in supermarkets when we go shopping so his body doesn’t over heat. ‘People always stare at his skin and I’ve overheard women before whispering about how cold it is and how cruel I must be to not make him wear a t-shirt.’ Geraint suffers from diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis - a condition where the skin is thickened and easily blistered. Geraint, who is now 18 months old, was born with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis . Geraint had to be taken straight to intensive care when he was born because doctors thought he had an infection. He was only later diagnosed with the rare skin condition . Strangers sometimes think that Geraint has been sunburned and accuse his mother of bad parenting . People often stare and mistake Geraint’s blistered skin for sunburn - assuming his mother does not properly care for him. She said: ‘When Geraint was born his tiny body was covered in blisters and a rash. ‘The doctors thought he might have had an infection so he was taken straight to the ICU. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis is an extremely rare condition. It is caused by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin. These cells contain substances, such as histamine, that regulate allergic reactions. The condition is usually found in children and typically resolves itself by puberty. It causes thickening of the skin and agonising blisters. There is no cure but treatment helps most patients. Typical treatments include taking antihistamines to prevent the effect of mast cell histamine. Source: Genetic and Rare Disease Information Centre . ‘I was completely overwhelmed and in a state of shock - my pregnancy was great and I’d had a reasonably easy labour so why was my baby’s skin so sore? ‘I started blaming myself - I was sick with worry. I was advised not to eat peanut butter throughout my pregnancy but I had and I kept thinking it could be the cause. ‘The dermatologist came to have a look at him and thought it might be mastocytosis so he did a skin biopsy. ‘When doctors confirmed it was diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis I was devastated - the whole process was a complete blur, I’d never heard of anything like it. ‘I was so frightened all I wanted to do was give my baby a cuddle but it would be too painful for his fragile skin. ‘I have to be really careful when I hold him because his skin blisters so easily. ‘Even breastfeeding was a struggle, it would make his body over heat and he would itch constantly. ‘Now, Geraint will scream for hours but I just have to sit with him and wait until he calms down - I can’t pick him up like other mothers would because it only makes him worse.’ The condition can even cause anaphylactic shock - a severe and potentially life threatening reaction. It is caused by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin. Mast cells contain substances such as histamine that regulate allergic reactions. It is hoped Geraint will grow out of the condition by the time he is six or seven years old . Geraint's mother said that after his birth she . initially blamed herself for his condition as she didn't know the cause - . she says she thought it might have resulted from her eating peanuts . when she was pregnant . His mother carries cards explaining Geraint's illness so she can give them to strangers who stare at him . Geraint has a bad reaction to most fruits and veg that contain high levels of histamine including strawberries and tomatoes. His mother said: ‘Geraint has to take his medication at least four times a day otherwise he can become extremely poorly. ‘As Geraint was born with the condition he is one of the lucky ones and will hopefully grow out of it by the time he’s seven or eight. ‘My dream is to be able to take him on a sunny holiday somewhere and for him to enjoy the heat like any other child. Ms Burns said: 'Geraint will scream for hours but I just have to sit with him and wait until he calms down - I can't pick him up like other mothers would because it only makes him worse' Geraint's condition puts him at risk of potentially fatal anaphylactic shock . ‘I’ve been fundraising for the UK Mastocytosis Support Group with an aim is to raise awareness and to raise money to fund research. ‘In February I organised a teddy bear picnic and we raised over £700, there are more events coming up including a Facebook auction and an entertainment evening at one of our local pubs. ‘The charity have been great and helped me understand mastocytosis so much more and I want to give something back.’ Irene Wilson the group leader at the UK Mastocytosis Support Group said: ‘With mastocytosis the body produces too many mast cells. Mast cells are found throughout the body in healthy people and have beneficial effects on wound healing and immunity. Geraint has to take medication at least four times a day or he suffers severe allergic reactions . Geraint's mother says she was terrified when he was born and that she just wanted to pick him up and comfort him but that this would have made his condition worse . Geraint's family is now raising money for the UK Mastocytosis Support Group which has helped them . ‘They can also cause disease by becoming involved in allergic reactions. ‘A child’s symptoms vary from child to child and can include itching, flushing, hives, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, GI haemorrhage, bone pain, headache and irritability. ‘Many doctors have never seen a case of mastocytosis especially GP’s and even some specialists might not recognise the condition. ‘Currently there is no cure for mastocytosis however there are options for treating the symptoms of the disease. No one treatment is successful in all children. ‘The cause is unknown and familial cases are rare.’ For more information or to donate visit: www.ukmasto.org .","Geraint Burns, 18 months old, has diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Every parent will know the joy of watching a baby tentatively crawl across the room, but getting a child to reach this milestone can be tricky. A designer from Taiwan has created a smart rug - fitted with flashing lights and music - that actively encourages babies to be more active and curious. Called JoyCarpet, the concept was recently crowned one of 12 winners of the second annual Lexus Design Award. JoyCarpet, concept pictured, was developed by Taiwanese designer Meng Ling Yang. The rug is fitted with flashing lights and music to actively encourage babies to be more active and curious. The device was recently crowned one of 12 winners of the second annual Lexus Design Award . JoyCarpet is fitted with LED lights that flash red, blue or green to grab the baby’s attention. It . also plays audio noises and short pieces of music that react to a . baby’s touch and movement. A hidden switch . beneath the JoyCarpet lets parents choose between two modes. Mode . 1 is designed for babies who are learning to crawl. A flashing . light appears on the rug to encourage the child to move towards it. When the child hits the light, a short musical burst plays and the flashing light moves to another part of the rug. In the second mode, designed for more competent crawlers, as the child approaches the light it moves away meaning the child has to chase it. JoyCarpet is fitted with LED lights that flash red, blue or green to grab the baby’s attention. It also plays audio noises and short pieces of music that react to a baby’s touch and movement, to encourage them to crawl and play on the rug. A hidden switch beneath the rug lets parents choose between two modes, and JoyCarpet is battery powered to avoid children getting tangled on wires. The rug is made of soft blanket material on top of an LED light panel, which sits above a sensor and soundboard. Mode 1 is designed for babies who are learning to crawl and a flashing light appears on the rug to encourage the child to move towards it. When the child hits the light, a short musical noise plays. The flashing light then moves to another part of the rug. In the second mode, which was designed for more competent crawlers, the light moves away as the child approaches it. A hidden switch beneath the JoyCarpet, concept pictured, lets parents choose between two modes, and the rug is battery powered to avoid children getting tangled on wires. The rug's top layer is made of soft blanket material which covers the LED light panel, a sensor and the soundboard . Mode 1, concept pictured, is designed for babies who are learning to crawl. A flashing light appears on the rug to encourage the child to move towards it. When the child hits the light, a short musical note plays and the flashing light moves to another part of the rug . The child then has to chase the light around the rug, and music will only play when the child hits it. JoyCarpet was developed by Taiwanese designer, Meng Ling Yang. Ling Yang said: ‘Curiosity makes us explore the world. 'We all get improved because of curiosity, including babies. [Babies are] curious to everything and make the most progress during the exploration [in both] brain and body. ‘JoyCarpet makes use of light and sound to provide an interactive experience for babies. In the second mode - designed for more competent crawlers - the light moves away as the child approaches it. The child then has to chase the light around the rug, and music will only play when the child hits it . 'Its flashing LED light attracts a baby's curiosity so it [wants] to crawl to touch the light area.' 'After they reach the area, JoyCarpet plays music as feedback to enhance the joy of the whole experience. 'According to research, crawling helps a lot for babies’ development both brain and body.’ Dr Rick Norris told MailOnline: 'Crawling is an important part of a baby's development. It is part of the process that allows young children to map their world. 'It is not only an important part of their physical development but also their mental development as it significantly increases their appetite for discovery and piques their curiosity as they become more mobile and therefore better able to explore their environment. 'Crawling is also the natural pre-cursor to their next stage of physical development - standing and walking. Another winner of the Lexus Design Award was Ooho, pictured. It has a double gelatinous membrane made using sodium alginate and calcium chloride. The spheres are created using gelification and its creators said the final package is 'cheap, hygienic and biodegradable' 'To be honest I am not sure most babies . need any encouragement to crawl as it happens quite naturally, however I . am sure they would enjoy the flashing lights and noises!' Prototypes of the concept are expected to be made later this year, but a release date and price  have not been announced yet. Ling . Yang will join other winners, including London-based Ooho designers . Rodrigo Garcia Gonzalez, Pierre Paslier and Guillaume Couche, at the . Lexus Design Award ceremony on 8 April in Milan. Ooho is an edible water container made from algae due to go on sale in Boston later this year.","The JoyCarpet is fitted with LED lights that flash red, blue or green .

"By . Mark Prigg . Walking and texting could soon become a lot less dangerous thanks to Apple. The firm has patented a system to show live video in the background when a user is sending a message. It would avoid embarrassing and potentially dangerous accidents. The Apple patent drawings show a conversation with 'Steve' which has the message bubbles superimposed over a live video feed from the phone's camera. The camera on the back of the iPhone captures video footage and displays it on screen. Messages and then superimposed in front of it, allowing users who text and walk, such as British Prime Minister David cameron, to text as normal, while still seeing what's ahead of them. The patent, which was published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, uses the phone's camera to 'continuously capture and present the video images in the background of the texting session so that the device’s user can continuously be aware of the environment beyond the device’s display while still focusing on the text message being communicated.' The display’s inventor is listed as Stephen Payne of Waterford, Michigan. The patent also hints at other uses of the technology, allowing users to stream the video behind a web browser or app. The patent suggests that the technology is fully functional but there is no indication when, or even if, Apple would roll out the feature. 'A user who is walking while participating in a text messaging session may inadvertently collide with or stumble over objects in his path because his attention was focused on his device’s display instead of the path that he was traversing,' according to the patent filing. The patent could cut accidents among those trying to to text and walk (or even text and drive) The latest version of iOS 7 already includes transparent overlays, such as when a user pulls down notifications from the top of the home screen. There are apps on the market that allow users to type over an image of their surroundings, but they require them to copy and paste the text into the relevant application, such as Twitter or the text message function.","Patents shows messages sent to 'Steve'

"By . Ruth Styles . When West End star Joanna Forest found a lump in her breast, she was just 21. A diagnosis of breast cancer made her one of the youngest people ever to fall prey to the disease. But after a gruelling regime of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy she was later given the all-clear. Now 36, she is helping to raise awareness of the disease in young women and the importance of checking for lumps by taking part in a charity concert tonight. Survivor: West End star Joanna Forest, now 36, was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 21 . Terrifying: Joanna aged 21, just before being diagnosed with breast cancer . A special one-off concert, Busting to Sing, will see her take to the . stage with Joe McElderry, Paul Potts and Jessie Wallace to name but a . few. Breast cancer is the . most common form of the disease in the UK, with an estimated 48,000 . women diagnosed each year according to the NHS. But approximately 80 per cent of breast cancer diagnoses in women are in the over-50s age group, which is why when Forest discovered a lump on her breast 15 years ago, she was so shocked. 'I was really surprised,' she says of the fateful moment she discovered the lump in her breast. 'It was something I didn't know could happen to someone at that age. 'I was away singing in a tour called The Best of Broadway and it was if it had just appeared overnight - I wasn't checking my breasts at all.' Concerned, she rushed to see her GP as soon as she was home but was initially fobbed off and told it was a lump, but not of the sort to worry about. But Joanna felt something was wrong and asked to have the lump removed. 'I had it out a couple of weeks later,' she explains. 'The day that I came back to have my stitches removed, they told me it was cancer. Then they gave me another operation to remove more tissue and some lymph nodes.' So began her battle against the disease, starting with a six-week course of radiotherapy followed by a gruelling seven cycles of chemotherapy. Instead of pursuing her acting career and enjoying twenty-something life with friends, Joanna was constantly exhausted and sick from the treatment and spent more time in hospital beds than in clubs. 'You want to be looking and feeling amazing,' she remembers. 'You want to feel on top of your game and full of beans. People were going out and it felt like I was missing out.' Performing: Jessie Wallace (left) is on the line-up for the CoppaFeel! concert as is Joe McElderry . Dream come true: Joanna will duet with classical baritone Paul Potts during tonight's concert . Campaigner: Joanna is now an ambassador for breast cancer charity, CoppaFeel! Luckily for Joanna, the cancer had . been caught early and after four years of hospital checks, she was . finally given the all-clear and told that she didn't need to return. 'It was a bit scary,' she remembers. 'It's quite reassuring to be told you're OK every few months.' But . although Joanna was lucky, others haven't been so fortunate, among them . Sophie Jones, 19, who died earlier this month from cervical cancer . after doctors refused her a smear test. Joanna, who is now an ambassador for breast cancer charity CoppaFeel!, says its crucial that young women remember to check themselves and understand that, although rare, they too can get cancer. 'To other women, I'd say it can happen to you, breast cancer does younger women so keep checking yourself, get to know about it and what the symptoms are.' She hopes too, that the Busting to Sing concert will help make a difference and encourage more people to check their breasts. 'We've got such an awesome, fantastic . line-up,' she enthuses. 'Who knew that Kat from Eastenders [Jessie Wallace] was such a good jazz singer? 'We've . got Paul Potts, Joe McElderry, Shane Ward and Rhydian Roberts so its . just going to be brilliant.' Pausing for breath, she adds: 'I'm going to be singing as . well and doing duet from Phantom of the Opera with Paul Potts. Even though I've done all kinds of things in my career, this is a dream come true.' Busting to Sing, tonight from 7.30pm at The Palace Theatre.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Just days after leaked images suggested Apple’s iPhone 6 will have a protruding camera, a patent has been issued giving an insight into what this feature may be used for. The patent, initially filed in 2012, describes a bayonet mount system for an iPhone camera. The system is similar to that currently used on SLR cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable lenses using a twist and lock motion. Scroll down for video . Apple filed for the patent in 2012, and it was issued yesterday. It describes a bayonet mount system for an iPhone camera, patent image pictured. The system is similar to that currently used on SLR cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable lenses easily . The bayonet mount system is currently used on SLR . cameras, for example, and lets photographers attach and remove . interchangeable lenses using a twist and lock motion. The bayonet connector system is the standard light bulb fitting in the United Kingdom, Australia, India and other countries. One side of the mount features radial pins that lock into a L-shaped slot on the other side (pictured above). Apple said the system is preferable to screw mounts because it is more discreet, and is more secure than magnetic connectors. Bayonet connectors are also the standard light bulb fitting in the United Kingdom, Australia, India and other countries. According to the Apple patent: 'it may be desirable to couple a lens to a portable electronic device including a camera. ‘The camera may not include optical zoom functionality, wide angle capability, or certain filters, and hence the addition of an accessory device may be desirable.' It continued that current lens accessory devices and attachment options for phones have been ‘unsatisfactory’, such as screw mount systems. Apple said screw mount systems can be bulky and increase in the size of the phone, and this may be ‘undesirable to a consumer.’ The . patent also explained a magnetic connection may be another option, . but didn't feel this was secure enough when walking or holding the device. ‘Additionally, . if the magnetic ring is improperly aligned with respect to the camera, . the view through the lens may be obstructed or distorted,’ said the . patent. Apple’s solution is a bayonet attachment that is functional, but takes up the least amount of space on the device. Images posted to Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera for the iPhone 6, pictured left, similar to those seen on the iPod touch. This protruding camera could be used to house the bayonet connector, pictured right, for its proposed interchangeable lenses . The protruding camera and rounded edges of the purported iPhone 6 prototypes are similar to those seen on the current iPod touch model, pictured. But this feature was purely design-led and wasn't used to add lenses . The bayonet mount, pictured, would be built onto the iPhone's rear-facing camera and would protrude marginally above the case . The mount would be built-in to the iPhone’s rear-facing camera bezel, which would protrude marginally above the case. Various lenses with bayonet-style connectors would then be attached and locked into place. To prevent damage to the lens, if the phone is dropped for example, Apple continued that the mount could be fixed on a ‘ramped surface’. This would allow the lens to detach from the device without twisting, if the lens is hit from a certain angle. Images posted to Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week purporting to show the next Apple device are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn. Although . the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and a . protruding camera, similar to those seen on the iPod touch. Current iPhone models feature cameras that sit flush the with rear casing. Alternatively, the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of Apple's MP3 player. There are already detachable lenses that work with iPhone devices, such as the Olloclip. This attachment comes with four lenses that create a range of photo effects including fisheye and wide-angle, plus 10x and 15x macro zoom. Each lens can be used interchangeably, simply by screwing them on and off, and the whole system costs £69.99.","The patent describes a bayonet mount system for an iPhone .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple is putting the finishing touches to a superthin 'iPhone Air' to be launched in September, it has been claimed. Following leaks claiming to reveal the specs and even schematics of a new handset, a French site working with a 3D artist created this images of what the iPhone Air could look like. Apple is expected to announce its latest handset in September, with a larger screen expected. Scroll down for video . Recent concept images by designer Martin Hajek, pictured, and Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni feature a curved screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints, first introduced on the iPhone 5S . Long-running Japanese magazine MacFan has published alleged drawings of what appear to be 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6c models in its latest issue. The images appear to show a flat, bezel-free device with rectangle-shaped volume controls like those found on the current iPhone 5c, as well as a camera with a single LED-flash on the rear. These mockups were created from the schematics. Apple has not commented at all on the rumours. The mockups, created by Nowhereelse by designer Martin Hajek, show a superthin design with round edges. Apple is rumoured to be considering different sizes of large screens, ranging from 4inch to 5.5 inches. The latest mockups are based on what are claimed to be schematics obtained by a Japanese website, which claims a 4.7 and a 5.7inch version will be made. They show a superthin handset with Apple's traditional fingerprint sending home button. However, the site cautions that none of the information has been confirmed. The handset could also be available in white and gold. Another new concept by Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni reveals a host of new features they would like to see included, with a curved glass screen and  shows how these devices will be. It shows a curve screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints. The pair also outline what they think the screens will be: 'The screens: 4 inch 1136x640 ( 326 ppi ) display for the cheapest iPhone, 4.7 inch 1920x1080 ( 440 ppi ) display for the standard iPhone, 5.5 inch 2272x1280 ( 510 ppi ) display for the largest iPhone. The concepts show a phone made from curved glass with a 'bump' at the top . The latest  rumors claim that Apple will launch three new iPhone models - 4 inch, 4.7 inch, and 5.5 inch. This new concept by Enrico Penello and Ran Avni shows how these devices could look. The latest mockup comes after Taiwanese sources say the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to ten megapixels from its current eight, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter allowing clearer pictures. According to MacRumours, the new filter will replace the hybrid IR filter used on the iPhone 5s with a resin lens filter manufactured by Japanese company JSR. Recent rumours also claim there will be two models, one with a 4.7inch screen, and one with a 5.7inch screen. Apple's latest iPhones: The firm is believed to be preparing to release two new large-screen phones in June . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the . record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, . at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, which could be the smaller handset. The two new handsets are expected to be revealed at Apple's annual annual developer conference, held in San Francisco in June. It is where the firm traditionally makes new product announcements. If announced, the handsets are expected to go on sale within weeks. Chinese analyst Sun Changxu told Chinese-language website QQ Tech that Apple will launch the follow up to its flagship smartphone in two large screen sizes. According to Sun, the iPhone 6 will come with a 4.7-inch screen, with a display resolution of 1,136 by 640 pixels. The company would then launch a larger 5.7-inch model shortly afterwards. Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its iPhone. Concept images have emerged that show Apple's next-generation handset with a super-thin slender chassis. This concept, by Italian-based firm SET Solution, predicts the handset could be 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom, in order to retain the home button . By comparison, Apple's current iPhone 5S, pictured, has a depth of 7.6mm. This makes it 1.7mm thinner than the iPhone 4S and 1.37mm thinner than the iPhone 5C . Two concept images have emerged that show Apple’s next-generation handset with a slender chassis, as well as a larger 5-inch screen similar to those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One. The first concept predicts the phone - dubbed the 'iPhone Air' - will be 4.5mm thick, while the second goes a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, Fuse Chicken’s concept suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys. In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, Fuse Chicken's concept - dubbed iPhone Air - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls . Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, pictured, which was 20% thinner than previous models . SET Solution’s concept, instead, keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top. It also appears taller than Fuse Chicken’s version in order to fit the larger screen. Apple’s iPhone has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the iPhone 5S would be the first to break the 4-inch mark - but it didn't. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand. However, with main rivals Samsung, HTC and Nokia releasing phones with screens in the 5-inch region, analysts claim Apple may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people. Last November, designer Martin Hajek created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the iPhone's screen size, without drastically increasing the size of the handset. In his image, the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges. However, because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident, when it’s picked up for example, the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced. According to Forbes journalist Anthony Wing Kosner: 'The only way I could see something that thin working for users, is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket.' He continued that if Apple was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest, which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis, it could also pave the way for foldable devices.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Ever had a funny feeling that someone was not being totally honest with you? That gut instinct is probably worth following as it is better at spotting liars than our conscious mind, said researchers. Automatic associations can be more helpful as logical awareness may hinder our ability to detect fraud, they added. Researchers found that when it comes to detecting deceit (illustrated), automatic associations - or using your 'gut instinct' - may be more accurate than conscious thought in helping humans sort truths and lies.  The study suggests that conscious awareness may actually hinder our ability to detect whether someone is lying . This could be because we tend to seek out behaviour supposedly typical of liars, such as averted eyes or fidgeting. Study . author Dr Leanne ten Brinke said: ‘Our research was prompted by the . puzzling but consistent finding that humans are very poor lie detectors, . performing at only about 54 per cent accuracy.’ She said that figure is barely better than simply guessing if someone is lying. The . psychological scientist added: ‘We set out to test whether the . unconscious mind could catch a liar – even when the conscious mind . failed.’ For the project at . the University of California, 72 subjects watched videos of ‘suspects’ in a mock-crime interview. Some had  stolen a 100 dollar bill from a . bookshelf while others were innocent. However, all claimed they had not taken the money, meaning one group was lying, reported the journal Psychological Science. When asked, the subjects only correctly picked the liars 43 per cent of the time and the truth-tellers 48 per cent of the time. But the researchers had also employed widely-used behavioural reaction time tests to examine more intuitive reactions. Pugh.jpg . These . results showed that participants were more likely to unconsciously . associate deception-related words – such as untruthful, dishonest and . deceitful – with the liars. The subjects were more likely to associate truthful words – such as honest or valid – with the suspects who were being straight. A second experiment backed the findings that our intuitive sense helps detect lying. The finding seems at odds with the fact that people are typically sensitive to how others are feeling, what they are thinking and what their personalities are like. Dr Ten Brinke hypothesised that the findings may be accounted for by unconscious processes. ‘We set out to test whether the unconscious mind could catch a liar - even when the conscious mind failed,’ she said. In the experiment, researchers made 72 people watch videos of ‘suspects’ in a mock-crime interview. Some of the suspects in the videos had 'stolen' a $100 bill from a bookshelf, whereas others had not. However, all of the suspects were instructed to tell the interviewer they had not stolen the money. When the 72 participants were asked to say which suspects they thought were lying and which were telling the truth, they were only able to detect liars 43 per cent of the time and those telling the truth only 48 per cent of the time. However, the researchers also used behavioural reaction time tests - one of which is called the Implicit Association Test (IAT) - to probe participants' more automatic instincts towards the suspects. Results showed that participants were more likely to unconsciously associate deception-related words - such as ‘untruthful’, ‘dishonest’, and ‘deceitful’ with the suspects who were actually lying. At the same time, the participants were more likely to associate truthful words - such as ‘honest’ or ‘valid,’ with the suspects who were actually telling the truth. A second experiment suggests that people may have some intuitive sense, outside of conscious awareness, that detects when someone is lying. Dr Brinke said: ‘These results provide a new lens through which to examine social perception and suggest that - at least in terms of detection of lies - unconscious measures may provide additional insight into interpersonal accuracy.’ Researchers from London have discovered our brains carry out different process when we hear genuine laughter compared to fake chuckles. When laughter is forced, for example, it activates a part of the brain linked with deciphering emotions. This means we know it's not a genuine laugh, and we automatically try to work out why they're faking it, what the laugh means and what the they're thinking. While genuine laughter lights up areas of the brain linked with happiness and positive emotions. To test the theory, psychologist Dr Carolyn McGettigan from the Royal Holloway University of London measured brain responses of volunteers as they listened to genuine laughter on YouTube clips. Each participant was asked to pick clips they found funny. This ranged from comedy shows, such as Flight Of The Conchords, and even the Eurovision Song Contest. The results were then compared to how their brains responded to fake laughter. The findings revealed participants, none of which were told the study was about laughter perception, could unconsciously tell when the chuckles were insincere.","A psychological scientist from the University of California found humans are very poor lie detectors unless they used 'automatic associations'

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . It might look like a giant whale in the sky, but this super-size plane is in fact Nasa’s answer to shipping spacecraft components around the world. Dubbed the Super Guppy, the aircraft is able to swallow other planes whole and has played a vital role in missions including Gemini and Skylab. The Aero Spacelines Super Guppy was first created in 1962 as a successor to the aptly-named Pregnant Guppy cargo aircraft. Dubbed the Super Guppy, the aircraft is able to swallow other planes whole and has played a vital role in missions including Gemini and Skylab . Pregnant Guppy helped achieve President Kennedy's goal of getting to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Without Pregnant Guppy, the only other way to get the Apollo rocket stages from California to Florida was on a slow boat through the Panama Canal. The Pregnant Guppy was so successful that ASI built a second larger Guppy for larger, heavier loads. There have been five Super Guppies built today, helping move spacecraft parts and fuel to vital locations, according to a report in Gizmodo. The Super Guppy is more than 20ft (7 metres) longer than an Airbus A320 and has a wingspan of 156 ft 3 inches (47.6 metres) compared to an A320 wingspan of 117 ft 5 inches (35.8 metres) Two retired Nasa T-38 trainers mounted on a transport pallet atop a mobile transporter are positioned for loading aboard Nasa's Super Guppy .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Human batteries may have seemed a little far-fetched when the Matrix film was released in 1999, but 15 years on, researchers could be about to make it a reality. Professor Bo Meng from Peking University has built a generator capable of charging a mobile phone using electrons produced by our bodies. The device, called a single-friction-surface triboelectric generator (STEG), produces a charge when a finger or palm taps a layer of conductive material attached to a device. Researchers from Beijing fitted a phone with a layer of materials that generates an electric charge when rubbed together.

Static electricity is an example of triboelectric charging, and the strength of the charge differs depending on the materials being used. The Beijing-based researchers previously created a generator capable of harnessing this triboelectric charge using a grounded electrode, but recently replaced it with a ‘body contact’ version. During recent tests, published in the Applied Physics Letters, Professor Meng and his team fitted a mobile phone with a transparent layer of STEG composite material. In 1999 film The Matrix, human bodies were wired up to machines and used as batteries, still pictured. Last year, Fujifilm demonstrated a thermoelectric conversion material that turns changes in body temperature into an electrical charge . The body contact electrode was then fitted to the side of the device, and the user’s finger or palm. As a user tapped the STEG material layer, electrons were moved between the skin and the phone. Repeated tapping caused this charge to move between the charged skin and the electrode, which in turn harnessed the energy. This energy could then be used to charge the phone, or other low-power devices. Researchers also discovered that the body contact electrode performed better, and harnessed more energy, than the previous grounded electrode. The generator uses triboelectric charging.

"Researchers have a made a major step forward in the development of quantum computers that can run at speeds far faster than current systems. A Spanish team claims to have created a pair of particles with 103 dimensions. The experiment smashes the previous record of 11 dimensions, and mean quantum computers are one step closer to becoming commonplace. Scroll down for video . A current quatum computer chip: Unlike 'bits' found in normal computers that can only be on or off at any one time, qubits can also be in a 'mixed state' between these points. This means quantum computers such as the D-Wave range can peform single tasks much faster than normal computers, and perform multiple tasks at once, much more efficiently. The latest breakthrough could make them even more powerful. Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated or interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently – instead, a quantum state may be given for the system as a whole. Superpositions are produced, such as the possibility of being in two places at once, which defies intuition. In addition, when two particles are entangled a connection is generated: measuring the state of one (whether they are in one place or another, or spinning one way or another, for example) affects the state of the other particle instantly, no matter how far away from each other they are. The discovery could represent a great advance toward the construction of quantum computers with much higher processing speeds than current ones, and toward a better encryption of information, the researchers say. The states in which elementary particles, such as photons, can be found have properties which are beyond common sense. The phenomenon means that superpositions are produced, such as the possibility of being in two places at once, which defies intuition. This allows quantum computers, for instance, to process more than one thing at a time more effectively - and makes them much quicker when processing several tasks at the same time. In addition, when two particles are entangled a connection is generated: measuring the state of one (whether they are in one place or another, or spinning one way or another, for example) affects the state of the other particle instantly, no matter how far away from each other they are. Scientists have spent years combining both properties to construct networks of entangled particles in a state of superposition. This in turn allows constructing quantum computers capable of operating at unimaginable speeds, encrypting information with total security and conducting experiments in quantum mechanics which would be impossible to carry out otherwise. An example of a two-dimensional subspace is shown. The intensities and phases for two different modes in the z basis are demonstrated, and their superposition leads to a mode in the x basis. The y basis can be constructed similarly. Until now, in order to increase the 'computing' capacity of these particle systems, scientists have mainly turned to increasing the number of entangled particles, each of them in a two-dimensional state of superposition: a qubit (the quantum equivalent to an information bit, but with values which can be 1, 0 or an overlap of both values). Using this method, scientists managed to entangle up to 14 particles, an authentic multitude given its experimental difficulty.The research team was directed by Anton Zeilinger and Mario Krenn from the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. It included the participation of Marcus Huber, researcher from the Group of Quantum Information and Quantum Phenomena from the UAB Department of Physics, as well as visiting researcher at the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO). The team has advanced one more step towards improving entangled quantum systems. In an article published this week in the journal PNAS, scientists described how they managed to achieve a quantum entanglement with a minimum of 103 dimensions with only two particles. Modern day computers run on a model designed by Alan Turing in the 1930s. They are digital and use bits to transfer information and perform tasks. They use binary code and can only ever been in an active, or an inactive state - running at one or zero. This means that a single bit is either on or off at any one time. The D-Wave quantum computer . Qubits work differently and can be on, off, or in a mixed state in between. As a result, qubits are able to be in . multiple places at the same time. Whereas the original Turing computer can only make one calculation at a time, quantum computers are capable of . performing single tasks faster, and performing multiple tasks more . effectively. Tasks that would take normal computers years to complete can be processed in seconds using quantum computers like the D-Wave. 'We have two Schrödinger cats which could be alive, dead, or in 101 other states simultaneously', Huber jokes, 'plus, they are entangled in such a way that what happens to one immediately affects the other'. The results implies a record in quantum entanglements of multiple dimensions with two particles, established until now at 11 dimensions. Instead of entangling many particles with a qubit of information each, scientists generated one single pair of entangled photons in which each could be in more than one hundred states, or in any of the superpositions of theses states; something much easier than entangling many particles. These highly complex states correspond to different modes in which photons may find themselves in, with a distribution of their characteristic phase, angular momentum and intensity for each mode. 'This high dimension quantum entanglement offers great potential for quantum information applications. 'In cryptography, for example, our method would allow us to maintain the security of the information in realistic situations, with noise and interference. 'In addition, the discovery could facilitate the experimental development of quantum computers, since this would be an easier way of obtaining high dimensions of entanglement with few particles', explained researcher Marcus Huber. Now that the results demonstrate that obtaining high dimension entanglements is accessible, scientists conclude in the paper that the next step will be to search how they can experimentally control these hundreds of spatial modes of the photons in order to conduct quantum computer operations.","Could lead to unbreakable encryption and superfast computers .

"By . Cara Lee . Louise McQuater from Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, has chocolate allergy which triggers asthma . When . you tuck into those chocolate eggs this Easter, spare a thought for . Louise McQuater. For even one tiny bite of chocolate could trigger her . asthma and lead to a potentially life-threatening attack. Most people . think asthma is brought on by dust or pet fur, but there are many . triggers for the characteristic coughing, wheezing, tightness in the . chest and shortness of breath. However, many of the 5.4 million . Britons with asthma - and even some GPs - aren't aware of these, and . failing to identify and then avoid their more unusual triggers could put . them at risk. Indeed, Louise, 41, never thought chocolate was making . her asthma worse until December 2012, when her asthma consultant . suggested she looked at her diet after a number of attacks. 'I ate . chocolate every day so thought it might be a trigger and started cutting . down,' says Louise, a school learning assistant who lives with her . three children in Tullibody, Clackmannanshire. 'My asthma seemed to . improve, although I still didn't really believe chocolate was a trigger . because I'd never heard of that before.' But a terrifying experience a few months later made her realise it was. She'd . given in to temptation and bought her favourite chocolate bar, a . Galaxy. After the first bite, she started coughing but finished it all . because her craving was so bad. Her coughing worsened and she was . struggling to breathe - even a reliever inhaler, which relaxes the . lung's airways that can become inflamed in an asthma patient, didn't . help. She went to an out-of-hours emergency doctor, who put her on a . nebuliser, which gives high doses of reliever medicine through a mask or . mouthpiece, easing her symptoms. 'I was astounded chocolate caused . that reaction,' she says. 'Looking back, it's possible it played a part . in other attacks I'd had.' Since then, Louise, whose severe asthma is also triggered by dust mites, hay fever and mould, has avoided chocolate. Patients . who don't know all their triggers can risk asthma symptoms or attacks, . says Deborah Waddell, clinical lead nurse at Asthma UK. 'Everyone's . triggers are different and can be difficult to identify. It can take . people years to understand their asthma. Sometimes this can be because . their triggers are more unusual, such as chocolate, wine or fizzy . drinks,' she explains. 'Potential triggers are all around us. Health . professionals need to be open-minded when patients report what they . think makes their  asthma worse.' People whose asthma is triggered by chocolate may not be having a true allergic response . Patients' airways become inflamed . in response to irritant triggers such as exercise, stress or cold . weather, or allergic triggers such as pollen or dust mites. Irritants . make vulnerable airways inflamed and narrow. This leads to contractions . of the muscle of the bronchi (the main airway of the lungs), causing . breathlessness and other symptoms. With allergic ones, the immune system . goes into overdrive and sees the harmless substance, which can be . inhaled or ingested, as dangerous. An antibody, immunoglobulin E . (IgE), looks for the allergen and signals to the immune system to . produce powerful chemicals including histamine, which cause inflammation . and swelling in airways.Goblet cells, which produce mucus, are also . set off. This results in thick, sticky mucus in the airways - one of . the biggest problems during an attack is making huge amounts of mucus . you can't clear, explains Ms Waddell. Allergic asthma is often seen . in people with a family history of atopy (predisposition to produce high . amounts of IgE), including hay fever, eczema and food allergy, she . adds. The proportion of people with asthma who've had an attack in the past year . Triggers can be identified through skin-prick tests, where a . tiny amount of the suspected allergen is injected into the skin. A red, . itchy bump larger than 3mm appearing after ten minutes confirms allergic . sensitisation to that substance, says Dr Ramesh Kurukulaaratchy, a . consultant respiratory physician at Southampton General Hospital. Blood . tests are also used, when blood is mixed with allergens and checked for . IgE. But these only look for specific allergens and can give misleading . results. For suspected food allergy triggers, patients can take . challenge tests, ingesting small amounts of the substance under medical . observation. 'But access to allergy services is extremely limited across . the UK,' says Dr Kurukulaaratchy. Some people find they have more . triggers over time, while others may show a lessening of triggers. However, . Dr Kurukulaaratchy believes people whose asthma is triggered by certain . foods such as chocolate are not having a true allergic response . involving the immune system, but have been irritated by chemicals they . contain known to aggravate some people's asthma. 'Chocolate is rich in organic compounds called amines that can provoke allergic-type reactions in some people,' he explains. There . are natural and artificial chemicals in other foods and drinks that . could be triggers - for example, alcohol has naturally-occurring amines . and salicylates, and preservatives like sulphate, which are not commonly . regarded as triggers, but can lead to symptoms. There are natural and artificial chemicals in other foods and drinks that could be triggers . Mother-of-one . Christina Nicol discovered at 18 that vodka was a trigger for her, and . needed her reliever when it left her unable to breathe. 'Other types of . alcohol don't trigger my asthma but when I've tried vodka since, the . same thing happened, so I avoid it,' says the hotel receptionist, now . 38, from East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire. Dr Kurukulaaratchy says . salicylates (the active ingredient in aspirin) can be found in  herbs, . spices and mint - so even toothpastes and mouthwashes may lead to . symptoms. Samantha Rawlings, 30, had an attack after using her . mother's toothpaste instead of her own. 'Within an hour of using it I . was in hospital,' says the pub manager from Bristol. 'The consultant . said it was likely to be a chemical in the toothpaste.' Unfortunately, . there aren't validated tests for substances that provoke chemical . sensitivities, so recognising patterns is vital, says Dr . Kurukulaaratchy. Being aware of triggers can also help because there . are additional treatments for allergic asthma. One treatment, approved . for UK use last year, is Xolair, an injection which tackles IgE. 'New . treatments are being developed, so patients should receive more tailored . treatment,' says Dr Kurukulaaratchy. Drugs known as leukotriene . antagonists, such as Singulair tablets, which block a chemical reaction . that can cause inflammation in airways, can also be effective for . allergic asthma, adds Dr Nazim Nathani, a consultant respiratory . physician at BMI The Priory and City Hospital in Birmingham. 'As . well as trying to avoid triggers, it's crucial to take your preventer . inhaler (containing steroids) daily to build up protection - this should . reduce the effect of triggers,' says Deborah Waddell.

"By . Janine Self . Zlatan Ibrahimovic, hit or myth against the English? The Swedish motormouth with the jumbo-sized talent and an ego to match says he has no intention of ever playing in this country. Perhaps that has something to do with Ibra’s scoring record against English club teams. Chelsea fans might like to grasp hold of these statistics and pray that the trend continues in Paris tonight. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the funny, the bizarre and the brilliant of Zlatan . Fall guy: Zlatan Ibrahimovic (top), then of Barcelona, tangles with William Gallas during a Champions League clash with Arsenal in 2010 . England expects: Paris Saint Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic fields questions from the English media ahead of the clash with Chelsea at Parc De Princes . Ibrahimovic has played 15 times for five different clubs against English sides. He has seen a total of 1,310 minutes match action but scored just THREE times. Breaking that down, the world-class forward only nets once every 437 minutes against Premier League opposition. Also, it helps if the opposition is Arsenal. All three goals have come against Arsene Wenger’s teams, a double in 2010 for Barcelona and the other for AC Milan in February 2012. It would be fair to say that Ibra has under-achieved, pretty much from the moment he faced Arsenal as a fresh-faced kid for Ajax in 2003. Four meetings with Liverpool in . Juventus and Inter shirts have drawn a blank, ditto two fixtures against . Manchester United, and two games against Tottenham.

Rich vein of form? The enigmatic striker has scored three in his last five games against English opposition . After 10 matches without a goal, Ibrahimovic will argue that he is on a roll with three in the last five. He may not have had the goals to showcase his sublime skills but Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is adamant that the player he had at Inter would be a huge asset to the Barclays Premier League. Ibra says no. But England loves a mean, moody, larger-than-life character who can play a bit. Think Eric Cantona, think Carlos Tevez, think Luis Suarez. Hero or villain, football fans throughout the country would love to see another big, controversial personality strutting his stuff on the domestic stage. Take a bow! The 32-year-old scored a sumptuous overhead kick for Sweden against England in 2012 . Wishful thinking! Jose Mourinho claims it was a pity that the player never plied his trade in the Premier League . Sadly, at the age of 32, the clock is ticking down on Ibrahimovic’s peak years. Even he has suggested that this might be his last chance for Champions League glory. Having said that, he has been in awesome form this season. His total of 40 goals is a club record at PSG and he has netted 10 times in seven Champions League appearances, including four against Anderlecht. Finally, and Chelsea supporters might like to look away now, Ibrahimovic certainly has no problems with the England national side. Go back to November 2012.

"By . Mark Prigg . In the quiet suburbs of Palo Alto where the tech elite live, a modern day ark is taking shape. Chris Robinson, a designer, began thinking about the how his family could surive an event similar to the 2011 Japanese Tsunami. Now, he has almost finished his project - a giant 'tsunamiball' that can float away from its perch in his back garden, keeping its occupants safe inside. The shell of the tsunamiball nears completion in Palo Alto . Inside the ark: watertight portholes allow those inside to look out, and can be covered to allow sleep on the craft. The boat will be left in Robinson's back yard, above the detached garage, several miles from the water. In the event of tsunami, he is confident it can withstand the initial impact of a tsunami from any direction while on land. It would them simply float on the surface of the water, with a double hull to protect it from surrounding debris. 'Tsunamiball is intended to be a tsunami-proof boat,' Robinson said. 'After the Japanese tsunami in March of 2011 I started to wonder how a family might survive such a brutal and sudden event.' Robinson then talked about the idea with friends, before he started sketching. 'The project started as a series of creative conversations and sketches with friends about possible ways to escape a tsunami with your family intact,' he said. 'The tone was light and playful. Ideas like helium balloon houses, and personal jet packs were exciting lunch time topics. 'Eventually the idea of a floating ball as an escape vessel was hatched.' Robinson, who said his wife was behind the idea, then refined the designed, still unsure if it was possible - and if he'd be able to make it. 'From that idea, through a series of sketches and several hundred web searches birthed the concept that a tsunami-proof vessel was a possibility.' Through the porthole: Chris Robinson working on the Tsunamiball, which he hopes to finish later this year . Robinson at work on the boat. He hopes to have it finished later this year. 'With no boat building experience and almost no time spent on the water, this was more of a fantasy than a practical planning exercise,' he admits.

Mixed emotions: Holly Bleasdale looked dejected after she failed to win a medal in the Olympic pole vault final, but she later revealed that she was getting married . She tweeted: '6th in the Olympics and @bradshaaaw proposes to me :) epic day!!!' Mr Bradshaw wrote on his own Twitter page: 'I have just proposed to @HollyBleasdale and she said yes!!!!! Best day ever!' Earlier, Bleasdale, 20, had struggled to keep her composure as she attempted 4.55m for the third time in the Olympic pole vault final.

Springing a surprise: Pole-vaulter Holly Bleasdale finished sixth in the Olympic final . On her third attempt she fell far short of the bar and looked devastated when she came crashing down on to the mat. Sitting with her hands in front of her face, she began to cry. But a minute later she regained her composure, smiling and waving to the 80,000-strong crowd that had cheered her through the competition. Speaking after the final, she said: 'I am trying to look at the positives and to finish in the top eight in my first Olympic final is pretty good, but I am just heartbroken with how it went today. 'I am only 20 and I feel like I could have performed well this year.' Bleasdale, from Preston, smashed her own British indoor record and moved to second on the all-time world list with a clearance of 4.87m in January. The dream dies: Bleasdale crashed out of the competition after failing to clear a height of 4.55 metres . A size ten, she previously told the Mail she steers clear of internet forums after commenters accused her of being fat. Miss Bleasdale, who has only been vaulting competitively for three years, said: ‘People on forums were asking “why doesn’t Holly look like the other athletes. Her coach should be doing something”. 'They were implying I was overweight and that my coach should be questioning why I wasn’t as lean. ‘But I know I need to be strong to do what I do.’ World champion Dai Greene could only manage fourth place in the final of the 400m hurdles.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Dogs love playing fetch, but it can be monotonous and boring for owners. But now a robot lets pets enjoy themselves, while their owners put their feet up. iFetch throws balls a variable distance and is triggered by the dog itself, so owners will no longer have to handle tennis balls wet with dog slobber. Scroll down for video . iFetch throws balls a variable distance and is triggered by the dog itself so owners will no longer have to cope with handling tennis balls wet with dog slobber. Here a chihuahua inspects the hole that shoots the small tennis balls . The robot shoots balls out of a small hole when they are posted into a large funnel by the dog. The compact device, which costs $99 (£60) is 8in (20cm) tall and 9in (23cm) in diameter. It weighs 2.5lbs (1kg) and gets its powers from the mains or six batteries if the toy is being used outside. iFetch launches balls that are one-and-a-half inches (4cm) in diameter – or  slightly smaller than a tennis ball, presumably so people have to buy the special iFetch balls -  three of which come with the device. The robot launches balls that are one-and-a-half inches (4cm) in diameter ¿ or very slightly smaller than a tennis ball that are then retrieved by a dog that posts them into the device's funnel (pictured) Owners who are fed up with picking up dog toys might consider training their dogs to tidy up after themselves. A . Treat & Train remote treat dispenser allows owners to remotely . reward their dogs for putting their toys in the smart toy box. The . $102 device, which is sold on Amazon, measures 14in (36cm) long and . 8in (20cm) tall and trains dogs to behave well by using . positive reinforcement, linking food to good behaviour. A . treat can be dispensed from the device from within 100ft away using a . remote control, or automatically when the dog puts a treat inside. Owners can choose how far they want their dog to run as the robot has three distance settings – to launch balls either 10ft, 20ft or 30ft (3m, 6m or 9m) – by pressing a button on the back of the device. Some customers have told the company that it took just 20 minutes to train their dog to play fetch independently – with the aid of a handful of treats. ‘If your dog already loves to play fetch, it should be pretty easy,’ the firm said.

Here a small dog waits for the robot to launch a ball . However, the company warned that too much excitement and excess slobbering can be a problem for the device. It said: ‘Some dogs slobber more than others. If your dog is a heavy slobberer the iFetch may require wiping off balls from time to time, making it difficult for the dog to play continuously by itself.’ While the robot is great for exercising smaller dogs, the company, which is based in Austin, Texas, said it is developing a larger and more powerful version of the robot for bigger dogs.

"By . Rebecca English Royal Correspondent . She was handed the reins of her first pony as soon as she could walk. Now, as her 88th birthday approaches this month, the Queen shows no sign of giving up the pastime she has loved since childhood. Taking in the glorious spring sunshine at Windsor in recent days, the Queen rides Carltonlima Emma, one of her favourite ponies. Out for a ride: The Queen enjoys the sunshine in Windsor accompanied by her stud groom Terry Pendry . Stable temperament: Her Majesty loves gentle fell ponies, and is the patron of the Fell Pony Society . Outfit: The Queen wore her usual get-up of a silk scarf over her hair, a mac and jodhpurs . Wearing her usual riding get-up of a silk scarf over her hair, mac and jodhpurs, she was accompanied by her stud groom Terry Pendry on a gentle hack around the estate. It is true that she doesn’t ride as regularly as she did, due in part to a niggling knee injury. And she now prefers to ride smaller fell ponies, a versatile working breed renowned for their steady temperament. Originating from farms in the north of . England, fell ponies are frequently used as riding or driving animals . as they are noted for their hardiness, agility, strength and . sure-footedness. The Queen adores the breed so much she has become patron of the Fell Pony Society. The sovereign donned a pair of . white jodhpurs and cherry red leather riding boots and carried a crop in . her hand as she picked her way confidently over the uneven ground on her estate. Family album: The Queen was handed the reins of her first pony as soon as she could walk. This photograph of her on her Shetland pony Peggy in 1930 was revealed to mark the birth of Prince William's son George .

One onlooker said: ‘It is remarkable to think that she is a woman rapidly approaching the age of 90. ‘She . isn’t seen riding out at Windsor as much as she used to but still likes . to enjoy the odd hack out when she can on a fine day. ‘The ponies she rides now are fairly small and stocky but clearly are a more comfortable ride.’ Sources . say the Queen is still a familiar figure at the stables at Windsor and . takes a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, many of whom are now . ridden by her grandchildren, most notably the Earl of Wessex’s . children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. One aspect of her riding remains unchanged, however – her refusal to wear a hard hat, which has sparked concerns over her safety in the past. The Queen summoned a rare grin last year when her horse Estimate won the Gold Cup on Ladies' Day at Ascot . It runs (gallops) in the family: Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were also excited as Estimate romped home . History: The Queen presents an award to PC David Edwards during a police horse show in 1986 . In a recent interview, racehorse trainer Ian Balding told how when he was hacking with the Queen at Windsor he took her to task over her refusal to wear a hat. ‘I really think it is ridiculous that you, above all others, do not wear a crash helmet,’ he said. The Queen is said to have replied ‘I never have and you don’t have to have your hair done like I do.’ It was suggested that this was less an expression of vanity and more a reference to her need to be ready at all times to undertake an official duty. Rospa, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, urges all riders ‘whether or not they are in the public eye’ to wear a hat in order to reduce the severity of head injuries should they fall. But recently a spokesman for the British Equestrian Health and Safety Association described the monarch as ‘old school’ and said the fact that she was still riding in her 80s was a ‘good advert for how riding keeps people fit.’ Horse-lover: Yesterday the queen unveiled a statue to commemorate the role of Windsor Greys in Royal life .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Hugh glaciers in Antarctica are shedding ice at a much faster rate than expected, a new report claims. The amount of ice draining from six massive glaciers in West Antarctica has increased by 77 per cent between 1973 and 2013, according to the report findings. Researchers studied the Pine Island, Thwaites, Haynes, Smith, Pope and Kohler glaciers, which discharge ice into the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Ice from just these six glaciers accounted for 10 per cent of the world's sea-level rise between 2005 and 2010, the study by the University of California-Irvine claims. Cracks in the ice: Six of the fastest flowing glaciers in Antarctica are shedding ice at an accelerated rate . This means the six glaciers are discharging nearly the same amount of ice as the entire Greenland ice sheet. Pine Island Glacier, the most active of the glaciers studies which has made headlines after dropping huge icebergs into the sea, is discharging 75 per cent more ice into the ocean than it was 40 years ago. The widest glacier included in the research - Thwaites Glacier - started to have accelerated levels of ice loss in 2006. Concerning: A massive crack can be seen across the Pine Island Glacier in this satellite image. The glacier is shedding 75 per cent more ice into the ocean than it was 40 years ago . Jeremie Mouginot, a glaciologist at UC-Irvine and co-author of the paper, said: 'What we found was a sustained increase in ice discharge—which has a significant impact on sea level rise.' The researchers studied cracks on the glaciers every year to see how much they had spread and to calculate ice discharge. If the glaciers were to collapse completely, sea levels would rise by another four feet (1.2 metres), claims fellow report co-author Professor Eric Rignot. 'To see Thwaites, this monster glacier, start accelerating in 2006 means we could see even more change in the near future that could affect sea level,' Mouginot added. If the six glaciers studied were to collapse completely, sea levels would rise by a catastrophic four feet . He added that the acceleration in glacier flow is being aided by warmer ocean waters. Huge ice streams flowing from West Antarctica are held back by floating ice shelves that act like dams. But recent studies have suggest the warmer ocean water is melting and thinning these ice shelves from below. This means the ice shelves give less resistance to the streams, forcing more ice into the ocean. Cracks can be seen running across the Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf. It is believed warmer ocean water is contributing to the acceleration of the glaciers .","Study looked at six of the fastest flowing glaciers in Antarctica .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Few images can beat those of Earth from space, which can display its magnificent vortices, stunning colours and abstract patterns in a way we rarely see. But its beauty can also highlight some of the world’s problems including pollution, desertification, urban sprawl, farming and natural disasters. In this series of images, Paris-based environmental activist Yann Arthus-Bertrand aims to explore some of the world’s biggest environmental and sociological challenges using satellite imagery. These rows of oppositely spinning vortices, caused by the unsteady separation of flow of a fluid around blunt bodies, can be seen over the United States, Alaska, Aleutian Islands. This phenomena is known as Kármán Vortex Street . Compiled as part of his book, Earth from Space, Mr Arthus-Bertrand probes scientists and activists on how satellites can draw attention to some of these problems. Among the images is one of the Mississippi delta that is notable for its stunning red and blue patterns. But beneath its beauty the satellite picture reveals the devastation the Deepwater Horizon oil rig caused in April 2010. An explosion on the semi-submersible drilling unit killed 11 workers and injured 16 others. It caused the Deepwater Horizon to burn and sink, resulting in a massive offshore oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi delta in 2010 after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Red indicates plant cover, while white and blue represent the water. Increased reflection on the surface, due to oil slicks, appear as a brighter white . Bombetoka Bay, the Betsiboka River's sludgy estuary, reached six miles on Madagascar's west coast. Islands stretch out in the direction of the current and are covered by mangrove trees, seen in red in this image. In the surrounding area, the cleared forest gives way to brush and cassava and rice plantations . The image was released months after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Oil slicks increase reflection on the surface and therefore appear as brighter white. It reveals the extent to which hydrocarbon pollution penetrated the delta's marshlands, which are so rich in biodiversity. Mr Arthus-Bertrand, who is also an environmental activist, arranged the scenes pictured in his book into themes including pollution, desertification, urban sprawl, farming and natural disasters. Another image shows Bombetoka Bay, the Betsiboka River's sludgy estuary, reached six miles on Madagascar's west coast. Islands stretch out in the direction of the current and are covered by mangrove trees, seen in red in this image. In the surrounding area, the cleared forest gives way to brush and cassava and rice plantations. Grid patterns of fields and pastures surround the whirlpools created by the Mississippi, the largest hydrographic basin in North America. A number of oxbow lakes are shown as the river moves south of Memphis, Tennessee . The Ebro is Spain's most powerful river. Stretching for more than 550 miles (900 km), it flows into the Mediterranean through a vast delta that juts far into the sea. Abundant alluvium and an ingenious system of irrigation channels favour rice plantations, notably the famous bomba rice . The Lena River flows north for over 2,800 miles (4,500 km) through Russian Siberia to the Arctic Ocean. As the Lena enters the ocean, it divides into many channels and forms a large delta. The Landsat 7 satellite took this image in July 2000 . Impressive phytoplankton blooms are also seen from space off Sweden’s Gotland Island. Most Phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the unaided eye. However, when present in high enough numbers, they may appear as a green discoloration of the water. Phytoplankton plays an important role in the ocean's carbon cycle by removing half of all CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and storing it deep under the sea. Recent research has revealed that water temperature has a direct impact on maintaining the delicate plankton ecosystem of our oceans. The new research means that ocean warming will impact plankton, and in turn drive the cycle of climate change. Other images include that of the Ebro, Spain's most powerful river, the Senegal River dividing Senegal and Mauritania, and the urban sprawl of Detroit. Mr Arthus-Bertrand also recently directed two films for the United Nations: the film Forest, official film of the 2011 International Year of the Forest, and the film Desertification. Both were screened during UN General Assemblies. The Senegal River is a 1,790 km (1,110 mile) long river in West Africa that forms the border between Senegal and Mauritania. In the Early Middle Ages (c. 800 CE), the Senegal River restored contact with the Mediterranean world with the establishment of the Trans-Saharan trade route .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . At first glimpse these pictures may look like nothing out of the ordinary - appearing to just show an ordinary leaf or a branch of a tree. But on closer inspection you can spot some of nature's true masters of disguise playing a killer game of hide and seek. From a katydid disguised as a leaf to a tiny Pygmy Seahorse camouflaged in sea fan in Papua New Guinea, these images showcase the creatures who can quite literally blend into the background. Nothing out of the ordinary: A Leaf mimic katydid is an uncanny addition to a group of leaves, left, and a Lichen-mimic katydid is barely noticeable camouflaged on tree . Illusionist: A leaf-mimic katydid - also known as a bush-cricket - camouflaged to look like a dead leaf to hide itself from predators . Masters of disguise: An Oak beauty caterpillar branching out, left, and a Hooded mantis hiding among leaves in a Costa Rican tropical rainforest . Barking up the wrong tree: A common potoo - a nocturnal bird which breeds in tropical Central and South America - blending into the bark on a tree branch . Hiding in the deep: A tiny Pygmy Seahorse, which only grow up to 2cms, pictured at 130 feet below sea level on a sea fan in Papua New Guinea . Making no mark: Another leaf mimic katydid shows off its incredible camouflaging skills by mimicking the leaf it is standing on . The talented animals have the ability to camouflage themselves within their environment to hide from predators as a means of survival in the natural world. The creatures photographed in this series of images use two basic methods of concealment in a bid to hide from predators and catch prey. Some animals, such as the flat fish, use their colour to blend into a background making them barely visible. Whereas others, such as the Katydid, cleverly mimic their surroundings using their shape, colour and texture to become part of the landscape. Photographer John Cancalosi who captured these images of camouflage animals said the animals used their talent to remain hidden from predators.

Lying in wait: The eyes of a flatfish peering up from its seafloor are the only thing that reveals its hiding place . Keeping a keen eye: John Cancalosi, who took this snap of a tiny red crab camouflaged on a Sea Fan in Papua New Guinea, said even he sometimes struggles to spot the creatures he photographs . In the eye of the beholder: A Lantern fly - a Central and South American planthopper - captured in a defensive display by photographer John Cancalosi . He said some had mastered the art of invisible so well it was a challenge for him to even spot them. He said: 'Katydids look so much like leaves in their colour, detail and texture, it actually looks like the leaves are copying the katydids. 'They are so used to pretending to be leaves they have the ability to remain completely still. 'There are also caterpillars who are such good leaf mimics when the wind blows they'll move themselves so as to appear like dead leaves blowing in the wind. It really is quite amazing to witness.'

"By . Anthony Bond . A museum in China has closed following claims that its 40,000-strong collection of relics is made up of  fakes. The Jibaozhai Museum, located in the city of Jizhou, in the province of Hebei, closed its ticket offices yesterday following claims that its extensive collection of ancient relics were knock-offs. Problems for the museum began at the beginning of this month when writer Ma Boyong noticed  discrepancies and posted his findings online. Staff at the Jibaozhai Museum have been left furious by its closing after the allegations about fakes . As reported by the Daily Telegraph, one error appeared to show artifacts engraved with writing which showed they dated back more than 4,000 years. But, according to a report in the Shanghai Daily, the writing appeared in simplified Chinese characters, which only came into use in the 20th century. Staff at the musuem have been left furious by its closing. Speaking to the  Daily Telegraph, Wei Yingjun, its chief consultant, said he was sure that at least 80 of the museumâ€™s 40,000 objects had been confirmed as authentic. He said: 'Iâ€™m positive that we do have authentic items in the museum. There might be fake items too but we would need [to carry out] identification and verification [to confirm that],' He added that any objects of suspicious origin had been marked up so visitors could not be misled. Mr Wei also vowed to sue the writer Mr Ma. 'He [acted] like the head of a rebel group during the Cultural Revolution â€“ leading a bunch of Red Guards and making chaos,' he said. Musuems are currently booming in China, with government figures revealing that nearly 400 opened in 2011 alone. But fake relics are proving a problem, with some reports suggesting that 80 per cent of fossils in Chinese museums are fake.","The Jibaozhai Museum closed its ticket offices .
