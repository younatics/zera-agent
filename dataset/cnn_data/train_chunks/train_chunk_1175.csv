"A copy of Adolf Hitler's infamous autobiography Mein Kampf which he signed in his bunker as the Allied armies closed in on him has emerged for sale. The copy of the hate-filled manifesto for his political ideology is believed to be the last one the evil dictator put his name to before he committed suicide in April 1945. He gave it to an unidentified senior member of his staff in what is said was a last defiant gesture in the hope his evil Nazi ideology would continue after his death. A copy of Adolf Hitler's infamous autobiography Mein Kampf which he signed in his bunker on March 5, 1945 as the Allied armies closed in has emerged for sale for £5,000 . The signature, once large and bold, had degenerated into a small almost insignificant scribble, showing how much his mental state had degenerated and he must have known . his inevitable fate . Mein Kampf, which translates as My Struggle or My Battle, combines elements of autobiography and Adolf Hitler's political ideology. It was written while the Nazi leader was in jail following the failed 1923 Munich Pusch and was published in 1925. It includes racist diatribes against Jews and their ‘twin evil’, communism. He argued that Germany would be forced to fight a war in the east as it secured ‘lebensraum’ – or living room – for its citizens at the expense of Slavs, whom he also viewed as inferior. It explains why aggressively expanded Germany eastward, specifically the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland, before he launched his attack against Russia. As a form of manifesto, he also argued that Germany would be better off without parliamentary government, which he blamed for the country’s problems. While the book is not illegal in Germany, the state has not allowed it to be printed amid fears that it could promote Nazism. Experts say that his signature at the . time was rushed and resembled little more than a squiggle, a reflection . of his scrambled state of mind at the time. The copy of Mein Kampf - My Struggle - was a limited print-run from 1939 to mark Hitler's 50th birthday. Underneath his autograph the Nazi monster wrote the date of March 5, 1945. At the time Hitler had taken up permanent residence in his bunker under the Reich Chancellery in Berlin while the Russians advanced from the east and British and Americans from the west. On April 30 - 12 days before the end of World War II - he shot himself moments after his mistress, Eva Bruan, committed suicide by biting on a cycanide capsule. The book was acquired many years ago by a British man from an American collector. He is now selling it at auction with a pre-sale estimate of 5,000 pounds. Richard Westwood-Brooks, of auctioneers Mullocks, said: 'The book is itself rare but this one bears Hitler's signature with the date of March 5th 1945. 'By March the Allied armies in the west and the Soviet Red Army in the east were making significant gains on German soil, and indeed on that very date the allies captured Cologne.

'But it is also well known that he believed that via some miracle some sort of surprise counter attack by the German army would turn the tide in his favour. 'So on March 5 he presented this book, signing it with his bizarre signature. 'We don't know to whom he gave the book, but it was probably a senior member of his staff, and it is quite possible that it was given as a parting gift. 'The signature is also significant as it shows how much his mental state had degenerated and he must have known his inevitable fate. 'His signature, once large and bold, had degenerated into a small almost insignificant scribble.' He added: 'Material from the last few weeks of Hitler's life are rare and this book is a particularly evocative reminder of the futility of his whole evil life.'

"Authorities near Pittsburgh have arrested an 18-year-old man who admitted to the brutal rape a nun in the parking lot behind the church where she serves Friday morning. The suspect, Andrew Bullock, faces at least 10 charges in the viscous attack. According to authorities, the victim was walking in the parking lot behind the Titus Church on Franklin Avenue in Aliquippa - about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh - when the suspect approached her and asked if she needed help. Monster: Andrew Bullock, 18, admitted to beating and raping the nun after exposing himself to her . The nun, 70, told the young man that she was fine and started to walk away, at which point the suspect told her to look down at his exposed genitals. When she continued to walk away, authorities say Bullock grabbed her neck and began to choke and punch the woman. 'The first thing you notice when you look up up where this horrific act occurred, is the statue of the Virgin Mary looking down,' Assistant Chief Dan Couch told KDKA. The brutality of the crime, Couch says, shocked and outraged many officers in his department. According to authorities, a boot print found in the snow matches the boots Bullock was wearing at the time of his arrest. Authorities say Bullock attacked the 70-year-old nun in the parking lot behind the church where she serves . The nun required surgery for a broken jaw suffered during the attack. She is recovering at Alleghany General Hospital. Bullock is charged with felony rape, aggravated assault and sexual assault, and misdemeanor charges of indecent exposure, simple assault and reckless endangerment. He remains in the Beaver County jail on $50,000 bond.","Suspect Andrew Bullock, 18, admitted to police that he attacked and raped the nun .

"Like most football lovers Inigo Calderon settled down last weekend to watch Manchester City against Arsenal. His enjoyment was short lived, however. 'I watched and tried to switch off the TV,' he said. 'They were on fire and I tried not to destroy my confidence! The trouble is that on Sunday the Basque-born Brighton right back has the job of containing those very same players and at right back he may even have the task of marking Alexis Sanchez; or, if not him, Mesut Ozil; or even Santo Cazorla, man of the match last weekend. For a side struggling in the Championship and on their fourth manager in two years it will be some ask. 'It's a joy to watch Arsenal when they play like this,' said Calderon: except when you're playing them, of course. Santi Cazorla (centre) produced a man-of-the-match display as Arsenal beat Manchester City 2-0 . Brighton defender Inigo Calderon (left) will be hoping to keep Cazorla and Co quiet in Sunday's FA Cup tie . Any suggestion that he might be psyched out by the prospect of facing the FA Cup holders after their 2-0 win at Manchester City is, however, a little foolish; for Calderon has a Master in sports psychology, obtained from the Basque Inistute of Physical Educaton in Vitoria, where he also gained an degree in sports science, all of which was done whilst playing professionally for Alaves. 'I did sports science for five years and afterwards I did a sports psychology Masters in Spain,' he said. 'I was playing for Alaves at the same time. In England that seems quite complicated but I don't know why? I don't see a reason why you can't study and play professionally at the same time. 'Even if you are a footballer you have to have a Plan B because careers are short: five, six, 10 years. And after that what? I don't know why in England you have to choose between being a footballer and studying something. It's a terrible mistake. I went to school in the morning and I trained in the afternoon - I am a footballer and I have a degree.' Calderon, pictured with Lewis Dunk, has a Master in sports psychology and a degree in sports science . There is indeed a cultural difference, a hangover in English football from the days when education was viewed with suspicion. Not so in Spain, according to Calderon, who says that other team-mates were studying and no-one thought it strange. 'No, I think it's normal. Not everyone has a degree but it's normal to study. What are you going to do in the afternoon? Play PlayStation? I don't think that's the best thing for anyone.' Yet even if clubs have become much more open to the idea, with the Premier League employing a whole department to focus on the academic education of young footballers, it isn't always enough to break down barriers. 'I know that here (in England) they look after the kids to further their educations,' said Calderon. '(But) the parents think their kids are going to be a footballer and they probably think the kids can get some money for the family. That's a terrible mistake because the chances of that are so small. I'm not saying that you shouldn't want to be a footballer, because it's a dream come true for me, but you can do the two things at the same time and I don't see why not. 'My parents wanted me to study at the same time because sometimes the parents, they are the ones that say: ""You have to be a footballer because you are going to earn a lot of money. You can help us"".' Calderon, pictured against Brentford in the Championship, joined Brighton in 2010 from Alaves in Spain . At Brighton, when the subject was first aired in the dressing room, it was received curiously by his team-mates. 'It was a bit strange for them, because obviously that is the way in England. You have to choose (between education and football). In Spain it was more normal than here because you can do both things. When I was in the (Alaves)reserve team in Spain there were four, five, six players studying at university at the same time. I think it is going to make you better as a person and a footballer at the same time. 'We have a lot of spra time and I think it's better to use it like that rather than playing with the Playstation – because I don't how to use the consoles!' The Basque Country defender, who found his way to the south coast at Brighton under Gus Poyet's managerial stint has become something of a fixture at the Amex Stadium. Now 33, he is into his fifth year at the club and has the experience of having played and narrowly lost 3-2 to a late Theo Walcott goal to Arsenal at his stage of the FA Cup two years ago. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud shoots and scores during the Gunners 3-2 FA Cup win over Brighton in 2013 . And his psychology degree is not simply a career on which to fall back when retirement comes, He recons it helps him even now. 'Every single day. When you have had bad day or you have been dropped from the team or you are a the bottom, you have to use it. I try as well to help the others in the team. You will have to ask them if they think it helps them or not but I improved a lot with the studies I did and grew as a person and footballer.' Football managers were once resistant to the idea of psychologists in the past – but Brighton employs one, Sarah Murray - she discusses new ideas with Calderon - and most teams are open to the idea. 'Managers always say that don't trust much in psychology but after you always see that they apply things,' said Calderon. 'Footballers don't like to say: 'I need to see the psychologist.' It's the culture. Hopefully in five or ten years, it'll be normal, like you go to the physio. It's like a taboo, you cannot say: 'I have a problem I have to go to the psychologist.' It is another side to the football. And it's going to make you better. 'In other sports you have this kind of help. Footballers are like: 'We are footballers, we don't need that.' We think we are in a different world but we are in the same as everyone.' Brighton boss Chris Hughton (left) will hope his side can put their poor league form to the side in the FA Cup . As for Brighton, their progress has stalled from the point at which they played Arsenal in this fixture two years ago under Poyet. Then they had just moved into the 30,000 capacity Amex Stadium, set rather spectacularly in the South Downs, and they seemed to be Premier League bound. Since then managers have come and gone and this season was a struggle at the bottom of The Championship until Chris Hughton was appointed at the turn of the year, since when three wins from four games has lifted spirits. Funded by professional poker player, Tony Bloom, the club's infrastructure has kept pace with the upward trajectory even if the team hasn't. The new training ground, opened last year at Lancing, is far superior to many Premier League facilities. 'As a club we are more ready to be in the Premier League, said Calderon.' Now our position in the table means we cannot be so positive as to think we can go up at the moment. But we are growing up as a club. We are in a better training ground, we are more settled in the division and I think you have to be settled in the division to go up. As a club we are ready to keep growing - but we have to improve in the table.' First there is Arsenal, of course. And whether Calderon's psychological edge will help on Sunday is unclear. Calderon laughs when it is suggested he might put his psychological training to good use in knocking the holders out of the cup. 'That's a different thing,' he said. 'You need more than one masters degree to play against them!'","Brighton host Arsenal in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday .

"Brazilian police killed more than 11,000 people between 2009 and 2013 at an average of six a day, a public safety group revealed today. The study by the Sao Paulo-based Brazilian Forum on Public Safety said police nationwide had killed 11,197 people over the  five years. Law enforcement agents in the U.S. had killed 11,090 in the past 30 years. The figures emerged amid reports that a rogue unit of police officers were suspects in the massacre of 10 gang members earlier this month in apparent revenge for the death of a colleague. Scroll down for video . Riot police evict squatters in Goiania, 800km northwest of Sao Paulo in 2005. Figures from a safety group today showed that officers killed more than 11,000 people between 2009 and 2013 - at an average of six a day . The report said: 'The empirical evidence shows that Brazilian police make abusive use of lethal force to respond to crime and violence.' In addition to using excessive force, Brazilian police frequently execute suspects, said Bruno Paes Manso of the University of Sao Paulo's Centre for the Study on Violence. He called it 'a practice rarely investigated'. There were 416 people killed last year in Rio de Janeiro state, giving it the highest per-capita rate. The study said 50,806 people were killed in all homicides last year, about one every 10 minutes. Nearly 70 per cent were black and more than half were aged 15 to 29, it said.

There were 416 people killed last year in Rio de Janeiro state, the study revealed, giving it the highest per-capita rate . In the latest case of alleged attacks by renegade police, a gang was reportedly gunned down in a six-hour killing spree by officers on motorbikes. The co-ordinated attacks came hours after a mysterious and sinister warning began circulating on an instant messaging app telling residents to stay off street corners. Video also emerged purportedly showing one of the officers in a Scream mask threatening to kill 'at least 30 thugs' shortly before the rampage. Shocking footage and pictures later began circulating online apparently showing relatives and friends sobbing over dead bodies of the victims. Tensions surfaced in the northern Brazilian city of Belem last Tuesday after police officer Antonio Marcos da Silva Figueiredo, 43, was gunned down by three men outside his home. Video of gang members reportedly threatening to kill police officers later appeared on Facebook. Video has  emerged online purportedly showing an off-duty policeman in a Scream mask (above) threatening to kill 'at least 30 thugs' shortly before 10 members of a Brazilian gang were shot dead by rogue officers in an apparent revenge attack for the death of a colleague who was gunned down outside his home . Within hours of the shooting, rumours of an impending revenge attack began circulating on social media. A message also sent to terrified residents through the instant messaging service, What's App, warning them not to leave the house. According to the BBC, it read: 'Don't go to Guama, Canudos or Terra Firme tonight. It concerns your security. One of our policemen was killed and we will be cleaning the area. 'There's no stopping any of us, not even the highest colonel. The boys are on the loose. Please stay at home. Don't go hanging out on street corners.' The message is believed to have originated from one of the renegade officers. Witnesses claim the police officers then went on a six-hour shooting spree on motorbikes, dragging victims from cars and executing them in the street. One father told local media that his son's body was riddled with dozens of bullet holes. Gunned down: Shocking footage and pictures began circulating online apparently showing relatives and friends sobbing over dead bodies of victims after they were allegedly shot by renegade police officers. However, Para's Security Secretary said many of the images showed victims of unrelated attacks . Speaking to the BBC, resident Joao Batista, 19, said of the WhatsApp messages: 'This is the first time I remember seeing something like this spread right around the city and cause such fear.' Disturbing footage and pictures later began circulating online that appeared to show the victims lying in blood in the road. However, Para State's Security Secretary said many of the images showed people killed in unrelated incidents. Walrimar Sousa, a spokesman for the state Civil Police in Belém, told the Wall Street Journal: 'All of the murders are under investigation. 'f there is any evidence that police officers were involved they will be investigated and held responsible. It is too early to say police were involved.'

"Jose Mourinho has said that he could never manage Tottenham out of respect for Chelsea fans – even though their Capital One Cup final opponents attempted to recruit him when he left in 2007.

"Space exploration is no longer the preserve of huge agencies who can spend up to £280 million on a single satellite launch. Now amateur engineers - working in bedrooms, basements and garages - have the chance to launch their probes into space for just £12,000. For the price of a car, anyone who can send a tiny 5cm cube satellite into orbit to take pictures of Earth and perform cosmic experiments. Scroll down for video… . For the price of a car, anyone who can send a tiny 5cm cube satellite into orbit to take pictures of Earth and perform cosmic experiments . This has all been made possible by . Glasgow-based start-up Alba Orbital who has recently begun creating and . selling the building blocks for tiny satellites named ‘PocketQubes’. Founder Tom Walkinshaw told MailOnline that he was inspired to launch the company after being rejected for a job at local company, Clyde Space. ‘My skillset at the time didn't meet what they needed so I had to essentially create a company if I wanted to be involved in the industry,’ he said. Clyde Space supplies CubeSats- a type of miniaturised satellite for space research that usually has a volume of exactly one litre and a mass of no more than 1.33 kilograms. Despite CubeSats' small size, they can still cost more than $100,000 (£62,300) to launch, compared to the £12,000 it costs to launch a PocketQube satellite. The smaller size of Walkinshaw’s PocketQube has driven down the cost of launch, and elements of a PocketQube can be stacked up to create a larger satellite. ‘We believe small satellites are on the cusp of a major breakthrough much the like personal computers were in the late 70's/early 80's,’ the company said on its website. While space research is currently dominated by large agencies, the ability to launch satellites on the cheap could open up a host of opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). ‘Small companies have short chains of commands, ideas can be implemented straight away and there is less bureaucracy and schedule slips,’ Walkinshaw said. The PocketQube deployer, named the MR-FOD, will next fly on the Unisat-5 flight on a Dnepr rocket . PocketQube has teamed up with an Italian company called GAUSS which has brokered launch opportunities with a Russian rocket called Dnepr . ‘They also have the freedom to try new things. Agencies may tend to stick to the popular choices as opposed to try something high risk with a low chance of success.’ PocketQube even helps find a launch vehicle. The group has teamed up with an Italian company called GAUSS which has brokered launch opportunities with a Russian rocket called Dnepr. This wasn’t what Walkinshaw initially set out to do when he started a company. Alba Orbital wanted to sell people the opportunity to have a space burial, with capsules of cremated ash being launched into orbit aboard a satellite. But they had to change course due to some legal challenges with the UK Space Agency. ‘We have a really difficult environment for space startups to succeed in the UK which has forced us to change the plan more than once,’ he said. ‘Startups in general have lots of challenges and it is a constant battle to raise funds and sell products, hence why we are focused on this Kickstarter.’ The company, who is based in a MakLab in Glasgow, has developed a number of prototypes and is looking for Kickstarter funding to develop commercial structures that people can buy. A number of satellites built to the PocketQube standard will be launched in November. These include Morehead State University's BearkerSat and the University of Maryland's QubeScout-S1.","Alba Orbital sells parts for satellites small enough to fit into your pocket .

"The universe could be about to collapse and everything in it - including us - will be compressed into a small, hard ball. The process may already have started somewhere in our cosmos and is eating away at the rest of the universe, according to theoretical physicists. The mind-bending concept has been around for a while, but now researchers in Denmark claim they have proven it is possible with mathematical equations. Scientists believe sooner or later a radical shift in the forces of the universe will cause every particle in it to become extremely heavy. The new weight will squeeze all material into a small, super-hot and heavy ball, and the universe as we know it will cease to exist . The basis of the theory is that sooner or later a radical shift in the forces of the universe will cause every particle in it to become extremely heavy. Everything - every grain of sand, every planet and every galaxy – will become billions of times heavier than it is now. The theory suggests that the new weight will squeeze all material into a small, super-hot and heavy ball, and the universe as we know it will cease to exist. This violent process is called a ‘phase transition’ and is similar to what happens when, for example, water turns to steam or a magnet heats up and loses its power. The violent process is called a 'phase transition' and is similar to what happens when, for example, water turns to steam or a magnet heats up and loses its power . The collapse of the universe could all be down to a subatomic particle discovered last year known as the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson particle is a manifestation of an energy field can be found throughout the universe called the Higgs field. The Higgs field is thought to explain why particles have mass. This Higgs field could exist in two states - one that we feel now - and another that is billions of times denser than what scientists have already observed. If . this ultra-dense Higgs field existed, then a bubble of this state could . suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time, . similar to when you boil water. The . bubble would then expand at the speed of light, entering all space, and . turning the Higgs field from the state it’s in now into a new one. All . elementary particles inside the bubble will reach a mass, that is much . heavier than if they were outside the bubble. The new weight will squeeze all material . into a small, super-hot and heavy ball, and the universe as we know it . will cease to exist. According to something known as the Higgs theory, a phase transition such as this took place one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang, causing a shift in the fabric of space-time. During this transition, empty space became filled with an invisible substance that we now call the Higgs field. Some elementary particles interact with this field, gaining energy in the process, and this intrinsic energy is known as the mass of a particle. By using mathematical equations, researchers at the University of Southern Denmark have discovered that the Higgs field could exist in two states, just like matter can exist as a liquid or a solid. In the second state, the Higgs field is billions of times denser than what scientists have already observed. If this ultra-dense Higgs field exists, then a 'bubble' of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at anytime, similar to when you boil water. The bubble would then expand at the speed of light, entering all space, and turning the Higgs field from the state it is in now into a new one. All elementary particles inside the bubble will reach a mass much heavier than if they were outside the bubble, and they would be pulled together to form supermassive centres. ‘Many theories and calculations predict such a phase transition– but there have been some uncertainties in the previous calculations,’ said Jens Krog, PhD student at University of Southern Denmark. ‘Now we have performed more precise calculations, and we see two things: Yes, the universe will probably collapse, and: A collapse is even more likely than the old calculations predicted.’ The collapse of the universe could all be down to a subatomic particle discovered last year known as the Higgs boson. British physicist Peter Higgs (right) and Belgian physicist Francois Englert (left) received the Nobel prize this year for work on the theory of this particle . ‘The phase transition will start somewhere in the universe and spread from there. Maybe the collapse has already started somewhere in the universe and right now it is eating its way into the rest of the universe. 'Maybe a collapse is starting right now right here. Or maybe it will start far away from here in a billion years. We do not know.’ The researchers looked at three main equations that underlie the prediction of a phase transition and showed how these equations can be worked out together and interact with each other. Although the new calculations predict that a collapse is now more likely than ever before, it is also possible, that it will not happen at all. It is a prerequisite for the phase change that the universe consists of the elementary particles that we know today, including the Higgs particle. If the universe contains undiscovered particles, the whole basis for the prediction of phase change would prove false.","Collapse could be down to a subatomic particle known as the Higgs boson .

"Arsenal's defensive crisis has become such an issue that the priority is to bring in a centre-half this January, where previously Arsene Wenger had been focusing on a defensive midfielder. Both positions need filling, with the injuries to Mikel Arteta and right-back and occasional centre-half Mathieu Debuchy only exacerbating weaknesses, rather than prompting this week’s enquiries. But now Wenger has to weigh up the likelihood of securing Schalke’s Benedikt Howedes or Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk this month. Howedes, who would be priced at about £15million, seems a long shot for a move in the next two weeks. Schalke have a Champions League tie against Real Madrid next month and, as captain, he is a key figure at the club. If he were to leave, the summer would be more logical. Schalke’s Benedikt Howedes (right) has been valued at about £15million and is a possible target for Arsenal . Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk is another target for Arsenal and would be easier to get than Schalke's Howedes . Winston Reid's contract is up at West Ham and the defender is being offered to Arsenal . Arsene Wenger is in the market to buy a defender and defensive midfielder in the January transfer window . Van Dijk would be easier to prise from Celtic but Wenger has to decide whether he truly wants the Celtic defender. Likewise Winston Reid, whose contract is up at West Ham and is being offered to Arsenal. Yet Arsenal have yet to finalise their target, and are unlikely to do so until next week. Wenger, whose side face Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday, says he is frustrated by the inaction. ‘We are a big attraction, but if it was easy we would do it. We haven’t found anyone. 'I am not the only one working on the case. It’s not a supermarket where you go in and buy a defender, it’s a market that is very restricted. 'Players who can strengthen the best 10 teams in Europe, you don’t find many and it’s the same for everybody. ‘Of course we have made enquiries and then you have a second handicap of who wants to sell their best players, especially a central defender, in the middle of the season. They say, “OK, come back in June or July and maybe yes”.’ Wenger insists they could cope without a signing. ‘We can, because we have Chambers, Mertesacker, Koscielny and Monreal, who can play centre-back,’ he said. ‘But we have now lost Debuchy, who could play centre-back, and Gibbs has been out. If we have another injury or two we will struggle. It’s risky. It’s too risky.’ Wenger is now paying the price for the gamble he made at the beginning of the season. When the club sold Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona in August, the club calculated that they had barely used the third-choice centre-half in the squad in recent years. Arsene Wenger currently has the use of centre-backs Laurent Koscielny (pictured) and Per Mertesacker . Wenger insists they could cope without a signing because they have Mertesacker (centre) and Co . Arsenal have Calum Chambers, Mertesacker, Koscielny and Nacho Monreal (left) as defenders . With 19-year-old Calum Chambers quickly identified as a possible back-up at centre-half, Wenger reasoned that he could survive the season with the current squad. Almost immediately that proved a misjudgment. Debuchy sustained a long-term ankle injury in September followed by Koscielny’s achilles tendinitis in October, so Chambers was called upon at right-back and Nacho Monreal had to take over in central defence. Ironically Bacary Sagna, who left on a free transfer in the summer and who often played as a stand-in centre-half, is so far down the pecking order at Sunday’s opponents Manchester City that he may be dropped from the Champions League squad to make room for new £28m signing Wilfried Bony. Arsenal sold Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona in August but could now do with the defensive cover . Bacary Sagna (centre) left on a free transfer in the summer for Manchester City but is not favoured . Arsenal also desperately need a defensive midfielder. Target Christoph Kramer is not available, having signed a new deal that will take him back to Bayer Leverkusen next season. But Ilkay Gundogan, a player they have craved in that role for two years now, appears to have recovered from injury and has been playing regularly for Borussia Dortmund. In addition, Dortmund are finally coming round to the idea of selling — his contract runs out in 2016 and the club are pressuring him to renew or leave. They would want £20m now — and with Dortmund threatened by relegation they would prefer him to go in the summer. Borussia Dortmund are finally coming round to the idea of selling the previously injured Ilkay Gundogan . Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp previously blocked Gundogan's move to Real Madrid . Arsenal’s apparent lack of strategy over the defence extends to the goalkeeping position. David Ospina should keep his place after last week’s clean sheet with Wojciech Szczesny, now 25, proving both in his mistakes against Southampton and his subsequent reaction — puffing on a cigarette in the changing rooms — that he has been slow to embrace maturity. Wenger has likened dropping Szczesny to the times he replaced Jens Lehmann with Manuel Almunia, a decision which infuriated the German. ‘Wojciech is a great keeper and will have a great career but he goes a little bit (at times),’ said Wenger. ‘I took Jens Lehmann out like that.’ Money is no longer a problem for Arsenal. They have cash reserves of around £60m, and though only around £20m is set aside for this January, big spending can be expected to resume in the summer. The days of City simply taking their pick of Arsenal players ought to be over. Off the pitch Arsenal can now hold their own; the real test is whether they can do so on the pitch on Sunday. Wojciech Szczesny has found himself on the sidelines since being caught smoking in the showers at St Mary's .

"Brendan Rodgers hailed another decisive performance from Mario Balotelli at the end of his best week at Liverpool after he played a key role in enabling Adam Lallana to score the winner at Crystal Palace to take Liverpool into the FA Cup quarter final, just days after the Italian had scored a late winner himself against Tottenham. Balotelli came on for the second half and partnered Daniel Sturridge, who opened the scoring on 49 minutes as Liverpool came from behind to beat Palace. And Balotelli then struck a fierce free kick on 58 minutes which Julian Speroni could only parry into the path of Lallana, who secured the wide. And Rodgers said: ‘The penny has dropped. He’s training well now and starting to really work and to focus in on his job in the team. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was delighted with the character of his side against Crystal Palace . Rodgers gave credit to Mario Balotelli (centre) for his role in Adam Lallana's (left) winner . Daniel Sturridge (centre) struck just after half time to draw Liverpool level in the cup tie against Palace . 'The other night when he came on, he got the winner and did very well and I thought today he came on and did very well. He had good strength and good power on the free quick and it was a terrific strike that forces the keeper to make the save.’ And with Sturridge scoring his second goal after five months out with injury, Rodgers can afford to be optimistic going into the final third of the season. ‘Daniel is just working his way back. It’s just about extending his game time because you just risk re-injuring him and that’s something we can’t afford. 'You see his qualities and his spend and touch. And he doesn’t need too many chances. He looks really bright.

Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew gestures on the touchline at Selhurst Park . Palace manager Alan Pardew described the cup exit as an 'opportunity missed' but felt Liverpool deserved their win. He said: 'I felt we didn't put enough pressure on Liverpool today. We had a great chance at half-time. We should have done better today. I'm not too disappointed but I do feel it was an opportunity missed. 'But we're not going to make excuses and I think Liverpool deserved to win, and you have to accept that sometimes.'

"Turns out getting rid of Alan Pardew has done nothing to lift the gloom at Newcastle United. The Londoner might have been a convenient scapegoat for disaffection in the North East but Saturday’s display in the FA Cup was wearisomely familiar. And at the end of a turgid performance, there were extraordinary scenes as the Newcastle players went to applaud their own fans and were greeted by a chorus of boos and chants of ‘We’re s*** and we’re sick of it!’ VIDEO: Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Leicester 1-0 Newcastle . Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after giving Leicester the lead during the FA Cup Third Round clash with Newcastle on Saturday . Toon goalkeeper Jak Alnwick is hopeless to stop the first goal of the game at the King Power Stadium . Ulloa is congratulated by his team-mates as the Foxes advanced to the fourth round of the FA Cup . Newcastle players look dejected after the final whistle as Vurnon Anita applauds the travelling fans .

Subs: Gouffran, Campbell, Bigirimana, Woodman, Gillead . John Carver 5 . Ref: Lee Mason 6 . Some fans did applaud but the majority appeared to be booing and gesturing for the players to leave. The players themselves looked bemused, unsure of what to do in the face of such hostility, before eventually departing. Truly this is a club in the midst of an identity crisis. ‘It’s hugely embarrassing but they’re entitled to do that,’ said stand-in coach John Carver. ‘The one thing I wasn’t going to allow was that the players didn’t go over to them. I was in front of everybody because we deserved it. That’s how they feel, they pay their money their entitled to do that.’ Carver, a Newcastle man to his core, knows better than most why there is so much dissatisfaction. Once this club boasted a proud FA Cup tradition — they have been finalists 13 times and have won it on six of those occasions. They have now won three FA Cup ties in nine years and on Saturday they played like a team whose board of directors have belittled cup competitions as being of minimal financial use. Carver had invoked the spirit of Sir Bobby Robson before the game and had expressed his desire to take the FA Cup seriously with a strong team — but in the cold light of day, and with injuries mounting, pragmatism trumps romanticism. Daryl Janmaat, Moussa Sissoko, Fabricio Coloccini and Jack Colback were all carrying niggling injuries and deemed too important to risk, while Ayoze Perez was deemed too exhausted to start. ‘The future of this football club is over the next few weeks and it was important we got people fully fit for our next game,’ said Carver. ‘I put out the strongest team that I could, other than Ayoze Perez, who’s come from a new culture and been one of our shining lights in a season and he’s run out of fuel, there’s nothing left in the tank. For me to play him with Papiss Cisse being in the African Nations, would have been a massive, massive gamble.’ Leicester also made seven changes — small wonder with 48 hours in between fixtures — but they at least attacked the game with an intent which belied their precarious Premier League status. Newcastle fans shout abuse at their team at the end of the FA Cup Third Round match . John Carver is yet to win as coach after Alan Pardew's departure to Crystal Palace this week .

The attendance was well down at the King Power Stadium in the all-Premier League clash . Marc Albrighton crosses the ball past the onrushing Cheick Tiote from the right-hand side . Ultimately, Carver, who wants the job, will be judged on his Premier League record. But Saturday’s performance did not bode well. They did at least produce the finest moment of the first half on 32 minutes — only to see their efforts ruled out by an offside flag. Vurnon Anita broke down the right, crossed and saw Emmanuel Riviere deliver a superb flick to Remy Cabella, who finished beautifully but was ruled offside. ‘We’ve gone out with a whimper because of a poor decision in the first half. I thought at the time it was a good goal, there was a delay with the linesman making the decision. Nigel Pearson said to me it was a good goal and it was onside but that’s no comfort because we’ve come away from home, brought a fantastic following and lost the game, which is not good enough.’ Leicester, though, had showed more desire throughout. ‘There’s no doubt the Premier League is our priority but it was always going to be important to get the right result here rather than the performance,’ said Pearson. ‘Today’s game was an illustration of two clubs needing to utilise the squad, so it didn’t make for the best game but we put in a very committed performance. And that’s important as January and February are going to be very big months for us.’ By then, Pearson hopes he will have fomer England striker Jermain Defoe in his ranks. The 32-year-old has spent a year in MLS with Toronto FC but is keen on a return to the Premier League and the Foxes are leading the chase for his signature.

Haidara gets down the wing from left back but is well tracked by opposing defender Ritchie de Laet of Leicester . Current hot shot Leonardo Ulloa had missed a fine chance on 11 minutes from a Tom Lawrence corner, shooting over when unmarked; and David Nugent flashed a shot across goal on 30 minutes. The breakthrough for Leicester finally came on 39 minutes, a short corner being played to Matty James whose rifled shot was flicked on by Ulloa and went in off the crossbar. It was no more than they deserved and in the second half, without ever setting the game alight, they consistently created the better chances. Newcastle’s Jak Alnwick had to react sharply to keep out a diving header from substitute Chris Wood before Jamie Vardy raced away on 76 minutes and drove in a shot the keeper pushed away. As for Newcastle, 17-year-old academy graduate Adam Armstrong impressed in parts and registered a shot on goal early in the second half. And Haris Vuckic had a free kick deflected, which almost fooled Ben Hamer. Other than that, there really was precious little else to cheer.

"At first glance, it resembles a giant rose, surrounded by green foliage. However, in fact this is a huge, violent storm of the surface of Saturn - and one that has been brewing for years . In high-resolution pictures and video, scientists say the hurricane's eye is about 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) wide, 20 times larger than the average hurricane eye on Earth. The spinning vortex of Saturn's north polar storm resembles a deep red rose of giant proportions surrounded by green foliage in this false-color image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Measurements have sized the eye at a staggering 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) across with cloud speeds as fast as 330 miles per hour (150 meters per second). Both a hurricane on Earth and Saturn's north polar vortex have a central eye with no clouds or very low clouds. Other . similar features include high clouds forming an eye wall, other high . clouds spiraling around the eye, and a counter-clockwise spin in the . northern hemisphere. A . major difference between the hurricanes is that the one on Saturn is . much bigger than its counterparts on Earth and spins surprisingly fast. At Saturn, the wind in the eye wall blows more than four times faster than hurricane-force winds on Earth. Unlike terrestrial hurricanes, which tend to move, the Saturnian hurricane is locked onto the planet's north pole. On Earth, hurricanes tend to drift northward because of the forces acting on the fast swirls of wind as the planet rotates. Nasa's Cassini spacecraft has . provided scientists the first close-up, visible-light views of a . behemoth hurricane swirling around Saturn's north pole. Thin, bright clouds at the outer edge . of the hurricane are traveling 330 mph(150 meters per second). The . hurricane swirls inside a large, mysterious, six-sided weather pattern . known as the hexagon. 'We did a double take when we saw this vortex because it looks so much like a hurricane on Earth,' said Andrew Ingersoll, a Cassini imaging team member at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 'But there it is at Saturn, on a much larger scale, and it is somehow getting by on the small amounts of water vapor in Saturn's hydrogen atmosphere.' Scientists will be studying the hurricane to gain insight into hurricanes on Earth, which feed off warm ocean water. Although there is no body of water close to these clouds high in Saturn's atmosphere, learning how these Saturnian storms use water vapor could tell scientists more about how terrestrial hurricanes are generated and sustained.

Unlike terrestrial hurricanes, which tend to move, the Saturnian hurricane is locked onto the planet's north pole. On Earth, hurricanes tend to drift northward because of the forces acting on the fast swirls of wind as the planet rotates. The one on Saturn does not drift and is already as far north as it can be.'The polar hurricane has nowhere else to go, and that's likely why it's stuck at the pole,' said Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University in Hampton, Va. This spectacular, vertigo inducing, false-colour image from Nasa's Cassini mission highlights the storms at Saturn's north pole. The mysterious six-sided hexagon is thought to be is nearly 20,000 miles (30,000 km) Scientists believe the massive storm has been churning for years. When Cassini arrived in the Saturn system in 2004, Saturn's north pole was dark because the planet was in the middle of its north polar winter. During that time, the Cassini spacecraft's composite infrared spectrometer and visual and infrared mapping spectrometer detected a great vortex, but a visible-light view had to wait for the passing of the equinox in August 2009. Only then did sunlight begin flooding Saturn's northern hemisphere. The view required a change in the angle of Cassini's orbits around Saturn so the spacecraft could see the poles. 'Such a stunning and mesmerizing view of the hurricane-like storm at the north pole is only possible because Cassini is on a sportier course, with orbits tilted to loop the spacecraft above and below Saturn's equatorial plane,' said Scott Edgington, Cassini deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. 'You cannot see the polar regions very well from an equatorial orbit. The north pole of Saturn, in the fresh light of spring, is revealed in this color image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft . 'Observing the planet from different vantage points reveals more about the cloud layers that cover the entirety of the planet.' Cassini changes its orbital inclination for such an observing campaign only once every few years. Because the spacecraft uses flybys of Saturn's moon Titan to change the angle of its orbit, the inclined trajectories require attentive oversight from navigators. The path requires careful planning years in advance and sticking very precisely to the planned itinerary to ensure enough propellant is available for the spacecraft to reach future planned orbits and encounters.","Hurricane's eye is about 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) wide, 20 times larger than the average hurricane eye on Earth .

"Harry Kane scored twice as he inspired Tottenham to a famous derby win in front of England manager Roy Hodgson – and even had opposing manager Arsene Wenger urging England to put him in the squad or risk losing him to another country. Kane scored from close range on 56 minutes and then a climbing header on 85 minutes to take his tally to the season to 22, with Hodgson looking on – though the England manager left early to ensure he could travel across London to watch QPR take on Southampton. But Wenger, despite being on the end of a 2-1 derby defeat, said that Hodgson will need to move quickly to include Kane in his squad next month for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania. Harry Kane's brace against Arsenal in the north London derby brings his tally to 22 goals for the season . The 21-year-old Spurs academy graduate's goalscoring form has put him on the verge of an England call-up . Even Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has conceded that he is impressed by the young forward's form . Kane's rich vein of form comes just after the striker signed a new long-term deal at his boyhood club . Wenger said: 'When you have scored the number of goals he has scored, if you don't put him in there, someone will give him a passport from another country.' Kane does have a father with Irish ancestors but has said he wants to play for England and it is now inconceivable that he would not be called up to the squad next month if he is fit. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was delighted with his striker's display – but insist that the 21-year-old can get even better. England manager Roy Hodgson was in attendance to watch Tottenham beat Arsenal at White Hart Lane . Midfielder Mesut Ozil had given Arsenal the lead before Kane's brace secured a 2-1 comeback win for Spurs . 'Harry today showed that he is a great player but my idea that he can still improve and we need to push him as his potential is massive. He's in a very good moment e's the leading goal-scorer in all competitions. If the national team manager thinks he's a player for the national team, I'm happy', he said. And the Tottenham manager claimed he has had no fear throwing youngsters such as Kane, Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason into his team. 'For me, you watch the training session and afterwards you decide if the player deserves to play. I don't look at the names or their years. This is my philosophy. It's very important for them to believe in our way. When you work with a player, you can see the quality but you still have to give them the possibility to play. You have to take a decision as a manager. You need to take a risk. Spurs' derby win was also Arsene Wenger's 700th game in charge of Arsenal .

"A Twitter troll who sent vile messages to a feminist campaigner on Twitter posted a selfie of herself enjoying a sightseeing trip to Buckingham Palace just hours before appearing before Westminster Magistrates' Court. Isabella Sorley, 23, posted the picture of herself on to the site along with the message 'Just chilling at the queens' (sic) yesterday morning. She is believed to have travelled to London from Newcastle so she could appear before the court in Westminster. The picture, posted alongside a link to The Clash song 'London Calling', will raise questions about whether Sorley took her trip to London for a court appearance seriously. Earlier this month, she also posted tweets saying that 2014 was 'the year of Isabella Sorley'. Sorley, from Newcastle upon Tyne, and John Nimmo, 25, from South Shields, yesterday pleaded guilty to sending 'menacing' messages to campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez when they appeared at court. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Isabella Sorley posted a picture of herself outside Buckingham Palace on the day she appeared in court to plead guilty to sending 'menacing' messages on Twitter . The court heard how Sorley told Criado-Perez to 'f*** off and die', 'go kill yourself' and 'rape is the last of your worries'. Nimmo told Ms Criado-Perez to 'shut up b****' and 'Ya not that gd looking to rape u be fine' followed by 'I will find you (smiley face)' and then the message 'rape her nice a**'. Nimmo also targeted Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, with the message 'The things I cud do to u (smiley face)', calling her 'Dumb blond b****.' Outside the court yesterday, Sorley blamed her Twitter tirade on jumping back on 'the bandwagon'. She told a reporter from The Newstatesman: 'I'd personally say the reason why I got into all this s**** is because I jumped on the bandwagon, so to speak. That isn't an excuse . . . I didn't even know who [Caroline] was until I was arrested and told by the police what she was about. 'Of course, I support woman's rights, being one myself. I'm ashamed of my behaviour and like I've previously stated I won't be doing anything like this again.' She said she made the comments to 'help people in the future to not make the same mistake that I have, [if] that only be just one person, then it will be worth it' The threats started in July last year after the Bank of England revealed Jane Austen would replace Charles Darwin as the face of the £10 note following a campaign spearheaded by Ms Criado-Perez. Sorley last month tweeted messages about how words 'are never a threat' and that 'Hard skin is something you have to develop in Britain'. One of the messages posted on December 10 reads: 'Bit pathetic really that you've wasted all of the time/money because you were scared by a couple of words'. Isabella Sorley (left), 23, and John Nimmo (right), 25, admitted a charge of sending 'menacing' tweets to 29-year-old student Caroline Criado-Perez when they appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday . On December 16 the Crown Prosecution Service revealed Sorley and Nimmo were to be charged with improper use of a communications network for their role in the 'avalanche' of abuse directed towards Ms Criado-Perez. Sorley has a degree in creative advertising from Leeds College of Art and is currently said to be working in an Asda supermarket in Newcastle. But she deluged Miss Criado-Perez with menacing messages claiming that she had just been released from prison, writing: ‘I will find you and you don’t want to know what I will do when I do, you’re pathetic, kill yourself before I do.’ Other vile messages included: ‘I’ve only just got out of prison and would happily do more time to see you berried!!’ (sic) and ‘Rape?! I’d do a lot worse things than rape you!!’ Troll: Sorley attempted to justify her actions on Twitter shortly after being asked to stop making threats . Rant: Sorley continued her Twitter rant despite police intervention . Sorley was arrested in October 2013 at her home in Newcastle and admitted to police that she had sent some of the tweets, suggesting she had been 'off my face on drink' at the time, the court heard. Nimmo was released on conditional bail, with Sorley, whose previous convictions include being drunk and disorderly on 21 occasions, remanded in custody. The pair are due to be sentenced on January 24 at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Sorley was warned by District Judge Howard Riddle it was 'almost inevitable' she would receive a jail sentence. He warned Nimmo, described to the court as a 'social recluse' who 'rarely leaves his house', that 'all options' as to sentencing remained open. Caroline Criado-Perez (left) and Stella Creasy MP (right) received the 'menacing' messages after a campaign for more women to be featured on banknotes in July last year was successful . Following the court hearing yesterday, Ms Criado-Perez thanked people for their support but warned that Sorley and Nimmo represented a 'small drop in the ocean' to the amount of abuse she received in July and August. She tweeted a statement saying: 'I am hugely relieved that these two defendants have pleaded guilty, meaning that there is no need for a trial and for the whole process to drag on longer - it has already dragged on for almost six months, with all the attendant anxiety you'd expect. 'This is not a joyful day; these two abusers reflect a small drop in the ocean, both in terms of the amount of abuse I received across July and August, but also in terms of the abuse that other women receive online - women who have little to no recourse to justice. 'However, I hope that for some people who are watching, this conviction will be a warning: online abuse is not consequence-free. I hope that some people watching will think twice before abusing someone else. There is not much else I can say given there are other cases still on-going.'","Isabella Sorley posted message 'Just chilling at the queens (sic)' yesterday .

"Referees were thrust back into the spotlight after a tackle that ‘could have finished Stephen Ireland’s career’ went unpunished - and Sunderland’s Wes Brown was sent off in a bizarre case of mistaken identity. The FA were hoping for a controversy-free weekend in the Premier League in the wake of Martin Atkinson’s failure to spot a dangerous challenge by Burnley’s Ashley Barnes on Chelsea’s Nemanja Matic. Matic was sent off for retaliating but Barnes was not even booked. Yet on the day that FIFA decided to take further advice on using video technology to help officials, even more high-profile mistakes were made. Stephen Ireland came off at half-time following a challenge from Hull's Maynor Figueroa (right) Hughes was left furious with what he thought was a 'shocking' tackle and left Ireland needing stitches .

"For the first time physicists have 'peered' into the heart of the sun and detected neutrinos created in the fusion process at its core. The researchers spotted the neutrino's using an ultra-sensitive instrument in Italy's Apennine Mountains. And the results could reveal new information about the lives of neutrinos as they complete a journey lasting thousands of years from the sun's core to Earth. An international team of physicists from the University of Massachusetts Amherst has detect neutrinos created in the sun's core (illustrated) for the first time. Neutrinos are created in a fusion process in the sun's core that is ultimately responsible for 99 per cent of its power . The research was carried out using the Borexino instrument in Italy, one of the most sensitive neutrino detectors on the planet, which is buried 0.87 miles (1.4km) underground. The Borexino instrument, located deep beneath Italy's Apennine Mountains, detects neutrinos as they interact with the electrons of an ultra-pure organic liquid scintillator at the center of a large sphere surrounded by 1,000 tons of water. Its great depth and many onion-like protective layers maintain the core as the most radiation-free medium on the planet. It is the only detector on Earth capable of observing the entire spectrum of solar neutrino simultaneously. Neutrinos come in three types, or 'flavours.' Those from the sun's core are of the 'electron' flavour, and as they travel away from their birthplace, they oscillate or change between two other flavors, 'muon' to 'tau.' One of the crucial challenges in using Borexino is the need to control and precisely quantify all background radiation. To do this Borexino's centre is filled with a benzene-like liquid derived from 'really, really old, millions-of-years-old petroleum,' says Dr Pocar, among the oldest they could find on Earth. The international team of physicists from the University of Massachusetts Amherst reported their findings in the current issue of Nature. They said that for the first time they have directly detected neutrinos created by the 'keystone' proton-proton (PP) fusion process going on at the sun's core. The PP reaction is the first step of a reaction sequence responsible for about 99 per cent of the sun's power, Dr Andrea Pocar of the University of Massachusetts Amherst explained. Solar neutrinos are produced in nuclear processes and radioactive decays of different elements during fusion reactions at the sun's core. These particles stream out of the star at nearly the speed of light, with as many as 420 billion hitting every square inch of the Earth's surface per second. They pass through matter virtually unaffected, which makes them very difficult to detect and distinguish from trace nuclear decays of ordinary materials. But now using the Borexino instrument they have been spotted, and it could reveal useful information on the journey they take to get to Earth, and also their behaviour, after further study. The Borexino detector contains nylon vessels (shown) to make ultra-fine detections. A benzene-like transparent liquid produces flashes of light when neutrinos (and other ionising radiation) interact with its electrons and nuclei, which allowed this particular detection of solar neutrinos to be made . 'With these latest neutrino data, we are directly looking at the originator of the sun's biggest energy producing process, or chain of reactions, going on in its extremely hot, dense core,' said Dr Pocar. 'While the light we see from the sun in our daily life reaches us in about eight minutes, it takes tens of thousands of years for energy radiating from the sun's centre to be emitted as light.' He added: 'By comparing the two different types of solar energy radiated, as neutrinos and as surface light, we obtain experimental information about the sun's thermodynamic equilibrium over about a 100,000-year timescale. 'If the eyes are the mirror of the soul, with these neutrinos, we are looking not just at its face, but directly into its core. 'We have glimpsed the sun's soul.' This inside view show the Borexino stainless steel sphere, prior to the installation of the nylon vessels in 2004. Every square inch on Earth is hit by about 420 billion solar neutrinos every second but they are very hard to detect without equipment like this .","Physicists from the University of Massachusetts Amherst have detected neutrinos created in the sun's core for the first time .

"When a British rock star ‘married’ her Texan heiress girlfriend, the two women wanted their big day to be unforgettable – and spent more than £100,000 to make sure. Deborah Dyer, better known as Skunk Anansie lead singer Skin, and billionaire’s daughter Christiana Wyly held a lavish civil partnership ceremony near Verona in Italy. Guests quaffed cocktails at the historic Villa Di Campo hotel, danced to an orchestra and feasted on £25,000-worth of fine cuisine. Up to £10,000 was splashed out on flowers and cocktails alone. Unhappy: Rock icon Skin's civil partnership to billionaire's daughter Christiana Wyly was wrecked after they claimed their wedding planners failed to pay bills . However, the couple now claim their day was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons, after being left with a string of unexpected bills. In the weeks after the  wedding, they received demands totalling £62,000 from the caterers,  musicians, florists and a  children’s entertainer. The singer and the heiress say they had paid a wedding planning firm a one-off fee which was supposed to cover all the costs for the day. They are now suing the women-only ‘lifestyle management’ firm Besos Concierge, of Hampton, Middlesex, for £100,000, saying they paid an all-inclusive fee for it to plan the event and cover the costs of the ceremony and party. Venue: The ceremony was during three days of celebrations at the exclusive Hotel Villa di Campo (pictured), in the Italian Dolomites . Claiming their memories of the happiest day of their lives have been tainted, the couple have issued a High Court writ against Besos and its boss Michelle Candice David, 28, demanding their money back. It is understood the firm and Miss David, of Hounslow, west London, will contest the claim. Skunk Anansie formed in 1994, broke up in 2001 and reformed in 2009. Their hits include You’re Too Expensive for Me, We Love Your Apathy and Good Things Don’t Always Come To You. On her website, 45-year-old Miss Dyer writes about herself saying: ‘A bit of anger can be very useful in the right place and time, it gives you sparks, gets you moving, feeds your passion, separates the girls from the toys!’ Couple: Skin is a DJ and model, but best known as the lead singer of Skunk Anansie while her partner Christina Wyly is an environmental advocate . Miss Wyly – described by her partner . as ‘my gorgeous wifey’ – is the daughter of Sam Wyly, one of the 1,000 . wealthiest people on the planet. An environmental campaigner, she boasts . on her website how she successfully badgered her father to divert some . of his fortune to green causes. The 78-year-old Texan billionaire, a . close friend of George W Bush, made his millions through a string of . capital ventures in computing, the financial sector and a steakhouse . empire. According to the High Court writ, Miss Dyer and Miss Wyly, who . live in a £1.6million farmhouse near Petersfield, Hampshire, enjoyed a . three-day celebration last August at the Verona home of a family friend. But about a month later ‘several of the wedding suppliers began to . contact the couple requesting payment’, said the couple’s barrister, . Abra Bompas. Star: British singer Skin found fame as the lead singer of indie favourites Skunk Anansie . By February, nine suppliers including . the orchestra had been in touch demanding their fees, she added. She . alleged that the wedding planning company had initially admitted in an . email that it was ‘liable for these outstanding payments’ and ‘would . arrange for all the suppliers to be paid in full’. Apart from the £62,000, the couple are . also claiming £30,000 they say they were required to pay Besos – which . means ‘kisses’ in Spanish – as a ‘membership fee’, plus £8,687 they . allege they paid the company, and a further £15,423 of their cash they . say it still holds. Besos and Miss David’s defence to the . action was not available from the court, and the claims in the writ have . yet to be tested in evidence before a judge. But the company is believed to be . accusing the celebrity couple of failing ‘to provide sufficient sums’ to . cover the costs of their wedding, a claim they deny. Through its solicitors, the  company denied any obligation to make any outstanding payments  to suppliers.","Skunk Anansie icon entered civil partnership with Christina Wyly last year .

"Deborah Kandlekar (pictured with her daughter Jasmine) has been told to remove the swing from her garden . Council bosses are forcing the mother of a special needs child to remove a garden swing - because the family did not have planning permission. Woking Borough Council has decided to issue an enforcement notice because the swing had been fixed to the ground - which officers said made it a development. But mother-of-one Deborah Kandlekar, who lives in the house in Woking, Surrey, has hit out at the 'petty' move. She said: 'I think it's ridiculous and it's like they are being anti-children and anti-families. 'The rear of the property has no grass, it's staggered, it's got steps. The floor is covered with tiled slabs and it is not practical for a swing.' The mother-of-one has an eight-year-old daughter called Jasmine who has special needs. She said: 'She needs to be active. She needs somewhere to play outside. 'There was ground pegs with postcrete [a blend of selected sand, cement and additives for fixing posts] in place but it can be broken up with a spade and no one can even see it. It's been outside for one year and now it's fixed with nothing.' In July 2013, a site visit was carried out in response to a complaint that a piece of play equipment had been located in the front garden, and the owner advised that it was temporary. On January 7 this year, the council received a further complaint that the toy was in the front garden and a letter was issued stating that if the swing was not fixed it could be considered to be temporary - but because it had been secured to the ground, it was classed as a development. A further house visit was made in March when officers saw anchor pegs and the cement had been used to secure the swing to the ground. During the council meeting on October 21, Councillor Liam Lyons asked for some common sense to be used. Cllr Lyons said: 'What we are talking about is a child's swing bought from Argos and as I understand it where it has been put would not constitute development if it had not been fixed in the ground with small cement footings, which is something the safety note which comes with the project advises to do.' The site is an end of terrace property which is set back from the main road and there is an open plan front garden. Woking Borough Council has decided to issue an enforcement notice because the swing had been fixed to the ground - which officers said made it a development . Cllr Lyons said: 'I believe something as innocent as a child's swing is not out of keeping with the street scene, but is in fact the thing we should be seeing in a pleasant family orientated residential community.' However, the question of whether this structure would encourage other families to place swings in their front gardens was also raised. Horsell East and Woodham councillor, Anne Murray said: 'We are all thinking it seems a bit mean to ask them to take it down. Would it be alright if everybody had a swing in their front gardens, and that is what we need to be thinking about?' Councillor for Knaphill, Saj Hussain added: 'You have got a swing today, a slide tomorrow and roundabout the day after. We need to take officers advice.' The enforcement action was granted by six councillors and Miss Kandlekar now has a month to remove the swing.","Swing installed in front garden of Deborah Kandlekar's home in Woking .

"A Sydney mother, who pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of a police officer in 2012, sent emails to the Prime Minister and the Russian President in which she defended herself and demanded asylum. Fiona Barbieri, 47, and her 21-year-old son Mitchell, attended their sentencing hearing in Sydney's Supreme Court on Wednesday, where the full details surrounding the death of Detective Inspector Bryson Anderson were revealed. Inspector Anderson died after he was fatally stabbed by then 19-year-old Mitchell Barbieri following a siege at a rural Oakville property in Sydney's north-west on December 6, 2012. Scroll down for video . The police interview of Fiona Barbieri after her arrest in 2012, following the death of a policeman at her  property in Sydney's north-west, was shown to Sydney's Supreme Court on Wednesday . The 41-year-old and her 21-year-old son Mitchell (pictured) pleaded guilty to killing Detective Inspector Bryson Anderson . During a police interview following the Barbieri's arrests in 2012, the 47-year-old mother who is believed to have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, told officers that Inspector Anderson had been killed in self-defence before demanding asylum in Russia. In the footage of the police interview attained by Channel Nine, Fiona is heard saying: 'what happened at our house today, where we were ambushed by an army of police officers, was self-defence.' She is then handed a telephone by the officers who allow her to call the consulate, to whom she says: 'It is the Barbieris, president Putin, SOS Australia.' According to Channel Nine, Fiona was advised by the consulate to forward her request via email, after which she refused to answer further questions from the policemen.

'We are living here in convict Australia, corrupt convict Australia, and we have been doing our best to get out,' she told officers. 'The New South Wales police force is corrupt - that is what we have been standing up against and that is why we are in here today.' Crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that Fiona and her son had been embroiled in a long-running dispute with their neighbour, which had been fuelled by Ms Barbieri's paranoia. On December 6, the tension spiralled out of control when the Barbieris spotted that Mr Waters was installing flood lights on his property. Fiona - swinging a baseball bat - and Mitchell - armed with a crossbow - confronted the electricians working for Mr Waters. The wife and brother of slain police officer  Anderson, Donna (left) and Warwick (right), leave the Supreme Court after the hearing . The parents of Mr Anderson, Red and Shirley Anderson, were also seen leaving the Supreme Court on Wednesday . Earlier in the month, the Barbieris cried and hugged in the dock as they prepared to plea to their roles in the death of Detective Inspector Anderson . Mitchell fired two arrows, narrowly missing them both, before he and his mother retreated into their home. As the first police arrived, the court heard the Barbieris sent an email to a number of politicians, including then opposition leader Tony Abbott and Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying: 'We have every right to defend ourselves, our family and our property.' Just over an hour later, it had become a 'siege situation' with Fiona and Mitchell screaming at police to 'f*** off'. Det Insp Anderson ordered the door to be kicked in and was stabbed twice by Mitchell - once in the cheek and fatally to the chest, Mr Tedeschi said. As he lay dying, the court heard that Fiona was heard screaming, 'it's his own f****** fault.. he fucking deserved it… let the dog c*** die… he deserves to f****** die'. The policemand wife Donna, said her husband absolutely adored their three children . Bryson Anderson with his wife Donna and children from left to right - Darcy, Cain and Olivia . On the morning they were due to stand trial last week, Mitchell pleaded guilty to the officer's murder, while his mother - who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia - pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of substantial impairment. Under legislation passed before parliament, a person convicted of the murder of a police officer while on duty faces a mandatory life sentence. But Mr Tedeschi said this was not a situation where life imprisonment should apply as Mitchell was influenced by his mother's delusions. 'He (Mitchell) had been under the influence of his mother ... and her delusions had to some degree been transferred to him,' Mr Tedeschi said. Olivia, Cain and Darcy could not speak highly enough of their deceased father . At officer Anderson's 2012 funeral, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the decorated officer was greatly admired by his fellow officers . Instead, he said the crown would be seeking a 'very lengthy' sentence. Earlier in the month, Inspector Anderson's family honoured the man who was a much-loved husband and father of three. Bryson's widow Donna Anderson and their three children Olivia, Darcy and Cain could not wipe the smiles off their faces when they told fond stories of how Bryson was always the larrikin of the family. 'There was the policeman side to him which was incredibly serious – he took his job very seriously -but there was the family side of him where he was just the clown in every family gathering,' Donna told Channel Nine's ACA. 'He just absolutely adored his kids,' she said. He was a typical dad - he loved dad jokes and if he could embarrass the kids in front of their friends that was even better.' Police officers and family attend the funeral of the slain officer at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Parramatta in 2012 . The family privately continue to struggle with their loss, and it will be some time before they finally come to terms with the tragedy . His three children could not speak highly enough of their father. 'He would totally just love life - it was awesome,' his only daughter Olivia said. 'Yes, he liked to embarrass us.' His eldest son, Darcy said he was a great dad who was always a joker. 'He photo bombed a lot – my first cricket game in my photo – he was in the background,' he said. 'Cricket is my life – me and dad built the pitch out the front in 2003 I think.' 'We got tonnes of dirt and just rolled it and got it all padded down and I just keep mowing it in.' 'He would totally just love life - it was awesome,' his only daughter Olivia (left) said. 'Yes, he liked to embarrass us' Bryson's family described him as a joker who had a great sense of humour . 'He was always a joker – he photo-bombed a lot,' his youngest son Cain said. While being dedicated to his family and career, he also managed to squeeze in volunteering with the Special Olympics, travelling to Vanuatu to give gifts to children and also volunteering as a firefighter. 'He would come home from the police sometimes he would only be there for an hours or so and then the bells would go off and he would go out to a fire call and he did that for nine years,' Donna said. During the committal hearing last year, a number of police officers broke down as they recalled the murder. At Detective Inspector Anderson's 2012 funeral, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the decorated officer was admired by his fellow officers for his tenacity and determination, as well as his empathy and compassion. 'He showed initiative and leadership; intelligence and perseverance; dedication and humility; and, memorably, a ready smile and an engaging way. 'Bryson drew people to him, without guile and without effort.' The matter will return to court later this month.

"Marcello Casella, 54, appeared in Griffith Local Court on Wednesday over his alleged involvement in a drug syndicate . One of the brothers behind Australia's biggest family-owned winery has been charged over his alleged involvement in a $15 million drug ring. Marcello Casella, 54, appeared in Griffith Local Court on Wednesday over his alleged involvement in the syndicate which police say produced, distributed and sold commercial quantities of cannabis and methylamphetamine. Mr Casella, who helped build the internationally successful Yellow Tail label, was charged with one count of cultivating a large commercial quantity of a prohibited plant and one count of participating in a criminal group, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. On February 12, police raided a property connected to Mr Casella in Griffith, southwestern New South Wales, and a dozen other properties in an investigation into the alleged major drug supply syndicate, carried out by Strike Force Oceanic. No drugs were found but police charged the 54-year-old, who is a champion clay shooter, over the improper storage of two pallets filled with shotgun cartridges and 60kg of gunpowder on the property. The NSW Drug Squad arrested 12 other people and seized almost $15 million worth of illicit drugs, ammunition, and weapons. The raids were carried out all over NSW and the ACT, including in Sans Souci and Miranda in south Sydney, Palmerston near Canberra, and Malua Bay and Batemans Bay on the NSW south coast. Two weeks after the raids, Mr Casella resigned as director of Casella Wines, the winery that produces Yellow Tail. Yellow Tail makes up more than a quarter of Australian bottled table wine exports, and the label is one of the largest selling in the U.S. On September 22, Mr Casella and another Griffith man were also arrested and charged as part of Strike Force Oceanic's investigation. Mr Casella will appear in court again on January 2015. Casella Wines, which is based out of Yenda near Griffith, is run by Mr Casella's brothers John and Joe.

"The study found that individuals started to become more aware of their health while in their mid thirties . In our teens, twenties and much of our thirties, it seems, many of us think we  are indestructible. But at 36, all that changes. That is the age, according to a study, that we start to become aware of our mortality and adopt a healthier lifestyle. A death in the family, a warning from the doctor or seeing an unflattering photo are the type of events that make people think differently, says a survey by Spire Bristol Hospital. The study of 2,000 people assessed . attitudes to health and found 56 per cent deliberately ignored warnings . or indulged in unhealthy lifestyles in a ‘live for the moment’ approach - . regardless of the long-term impact. But the average person can expect a health wake-up call by age 36, with over a third saying they had a shocking moment which changed their thinking such as seeing a relative fall ill, having a health scare themselves or getting negative comments from a friend. The research found that once people start to consider their future health, they take measures like monitoring and improving their diet and reducing their alcohol intake. Rob Anderson, director at Spire Bristol, said: 'These findings show that by our mid-thirties, health and well-being become a much bigger priority. 'Doing something about it can be daunting prospect, but there’s lots of support designed to help people lead healthier lives. 'Simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference and reassessing how we live our lives, and the value we place on healthcare, can mean huge long-term benefits.' However, the study also found that a free roaming six in ten adopt the . ‘life’s too short’ philosophy to justify choices they know have long . term health effects like binge drinking or a fat-rich diet. The top 10 health wake-up call moments: . 1. Getting older . 2. I had a health scare . 3. A close relative died . 4. A warning from my doctor . 5. Seeing a shocking photo of myself . 6. A close relative fell ill . 7. A TV programme about bad eating habits . 8. Negative comments about my health that hit a nerve . 9. I had a serious accident . 10. A public health message . Worryingly just four in ten thought looking after their long term health was more important than ‘living for the now.’ One in ten describe their current exercise regime as completely non-existent, while a further three in ten claim their only regular exercise comes from their day to day routine. The lackadaisical approach of some was also highlighted with one in eight actively choosing to rely on the NHS repairing the damage, rather than taking positive steps themselves. And one in seven deliberately ignores health warnings on a regular basis to indulge in potentially damaging lifestyle choices. When it came to taking action, people were most likely to say that they weren’t exercising enough while fixing their diet and not getting enough sleep were other problem areas. The research found that once people start to consider their future health, they take measures like monitoring and improving their diet and reducing their alcohol intake (file picture) Just 51 per cent would rather take preventive measures and try to avoid ill health or long-term consequences. Despite rude awakening in their mid-thirties, even those who turned over a new leaf can fall back into old habits. Rob Anderson added: 'Once people start to take responsibility for their health it’s important that they can access healthcare services swiftly and easily. 'Rapid diagnosis and getting issues sorted quickly can help people live longer, healthier lives.

"A woman driver who dangerously careered down a busy motorway while five times over the drink drive limit had to be stopped by other motorists who bravely boxed her in and snatched her keys. Julie Hancock, 47, of Heywood, Lancashire, was driving so erratically that she almost crashed into a lorry and a central reservation while swerving across lanes on the M66 at 60mph. But despite putting her own life and the lives of others at serious risk - she claimed that she did not 'view' herself as a criminal. Scroll down for video . Five times over the limit: Julie Hancock, 47, of Lancashire, was so drunk behind the wheel that other motorists had to stop her during the incident on August 20 . She had been heading towards Rawtenstall, near Burnley, in her Ford Fiesta at 5.45pm on August 20 when another driver became aware of the risk and feared Hancock would cause a serious accident. Thinking quickly, the man, who had been behind her, turned on his hazard lights and then pulled in front of her before putting on his brakes - blocking the road ahead. Another motorist then also stopped and jumped out of his car, opening Hancock's door and grabbing her keys from the ignition. They then called the police. When officers arrived and breathalysed Hancock she recorded 162 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35 micrograms. At the police station, the lower of two more samples showed 142 micrograms, Burnley Magistrates Court heard. Hancock later claimed that she did not think she would be over the limit and that she did not view herself as a criminal either. Erratic: Hancock was swerving across lanes on the M66 near Burnley at 60mph in her Ford Fiesta (pictured) and nearly crashed into a lorry and a central reservation before she was stopped . But while sentencing her, District Judge Sam Gozee, said: 'Miss Hancock, you are a criminal. This is the second time you have committed a drink driving offence in the past ten years. On the last occasion, it was a high reading. 'On this occasion, it's off the scale almost. Your driving on that night was dangerous, to say the least. It was so poor that members of the public intervened to stop you driving any further. 'The risk you posed on the M66 that evening, to the public, is really quite alarming. You could have killed yourself and you could have killed many other people. 'It's clear by the standard of your driving you had no control over that vehicle. 'You didn't think you were over the limit. I cannot accept that. You must have known you were in no fit state to drive. 'In essence, what you did is take your car as a weapon onto the road. 'It would be nice if the Chief Constable wrote to the witnesses in this case to recognise what they did on that evening, to prevent something more tragic occurring.' Hancock admitted driving with excess alcohol on the A682, at Rawtenstall, but was spared immediate jail, after the judge said one of the priorities of the court was to seek to rehabilitate her. Depressed: Her solicitor told Burnley Magistrates Court that Hancock (right) was depressed following the birthday of her son who died in 2012, aged 17, after sniffing aerosols . She was given 12 weeks in prison, suspended for a year, with 12 months supervision and must attend the Drink Impaired Drivers' Programme. She was also banned for four years and ordered to take a retest at the end of it before she gets her licence back, for public safety. District Judge Gozee, who said Hancock would be considered a high-risk driver who would be medically assessed by the DVLA, ordered her to pay an £80 victim surcharge and £85 costs. Hancock's son Danny Collins, 17, a talented rugby player, who had played for Burnley Rugby Union Football Club, tragically died in November 2012 after sniffing aerosols. The carpentry student at Accrington and Rossendale College had lived in supported accommodation at Chapel Street, Brierfield, after several years in a children's home. Banned: She received a four-year driving ban and was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison - suspended for a year . His birthday was on August 4 and her solicitor told the hearing how Hancock found the time around that date particularly difficult. John Rusius, defending, said Hancock had had issues with depression and drink, had been in a very difficult relationship and had been 'tipped over the edge' when her son died. The solicitor added: 'Since this incident she has taken steps to try and address her problems. She is looking at counselling for depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts. 'Today, hopefully, will be a watershed and she can put everything behind her and make a fresh start. She is trying to put everything right. She is full regret, full of remorse. 'To say she is terrified at the prospect of custody is very much an understatement. Immediate custody would have a terrible and drastic effect upon this particular lady.'","Julie Hancock, 47, of Lancashire, was five times over the drink drive limit .

"It's news that will allow women to save a small fortune on bikini waxing trips, Immac cream and razorblades: pubic hair is back in vogue. More and more ladies are shunning heavy-duty intimate grooming in favour of maintaining a more natural look, which men say they do in fact prefer on their partners. In a backlash against the bald Barbie look, 51 per cent of women do not style or groom their pubic hair, while 45 per cent admit to no longer being bothered to continue with their hair-removal regime.

Celebrities including Gwyneyth Paltrow (who has admitted 'rocking a 70s vibe down there') and Lady Gaga (who requested a mannequin with full pubic hair on tour) have recently admitted to preferring a more hirsute look down below, and many of us are following suit. Writing in the Telegraph, Beverly Turner credited Times columnist Caitlin Moran's feminist bible How To Be A Woman with encouraging women to sport the natural look rather than that of the typically bald porn star. In her book she explains that the fashion for hairlessness is simply the result of people watching too much pornography, and young girls being convinced they should look that way. But when it comes to those who do have a strict under-knicker beauty regime, 33 per cent shave, 15 per cent use hair-removal cream, and 27 per cent favour professional waxing.

"A graduate student has sued a textile company for refusing to hire her for a two-month internship because she uses medical marijuana to treat frequent and debilitating migraine headaches, a decision her lawyer calls discrimination. Christine Callaghan, who is studying textiles at the University of Rhode Island, sued Westerly-based Darlington Fabrics Corp. and its parent, the Moore Company, on Wednesday. The Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Callaghan, said it believes it's the first lawsuit of its kind in the state. Discrimination: A graduate student has sued a textile company for refusing to hire her for a two-month internship because she uses medical marijuana to treat frequent and debilitating migraine headaches . A lawyer for the company, Timothy Cavazza, said it had not yet been served with the lawsuit and it was company policy not to comment on litigation. He added that they were confident they acted in compliance with state and federal law and that the lawsuit would be dismissed. Carly Iafrate, the attorney who filed the lawsuit for Callaghan, said if employers are allowed to discriminate against medical marijuana patients, then its legalization would become 'an empty promise.' 'People with disabilities simply cannot be denied equal employment opportunities on the basis of the type of medication required to treat their particular condition,' she said. Employment discrimination lawsuits have appeared in other states that have legalized medical marijuana. Patients who have been fired, disciplined or denied a job after testing positive for the drug have previously sued in states including New Mexico, Maine, Colorado and New Jersey. Rhode Island legalized marijuana for medical purposes in 2006, although pot is still illegal under federal law. To use it, patients must get a doctor's OK and an identification card from the state. According to the lawsuit filed in superior court, Callaghan received her medical marijuana card in February 2013. The lawsuit says Callaghan was looking for an internship for credit toward her masters' degree over the summer, and a professor connected her with Darlington Fabrics. After working out the details of the paid, for-credit internship, she was asked to meet with the company's human resources department. The lawsuit says the meeting was a formality and prior to it, 'all indications were that Callaghan would have the position.' During that meeting, she disclosed that she had a medical condition and held a medical marijuana card, according to the lawsuit. She said she would not bring the drug to the company or use it before work. A few days later, the lawsuit says, she was called by two company employees who told her 'they could not employ Callaghan because of her status as a medical marijuana patient.' Callaghan says as a result, she was unable to find a new summer internship, jeopardizing her ability to graduate on time, and was forced to disclose her medical condition to her professors. The lawsuit says Darlington's actions violated state law that protects qualified medical marijuana users from employment discrimination. It asks for unspecified damages and legal fees.","Christine Callaghan uses medical marijuana to treat frequent and debilitating migraine headaches .

"A prominent Republican campaigner is due in court today after five women came forward to say he had raped or sexually assaulted them. Gregory Nathan Peterson, 37, has been accused of attacks going back to April 2010 when one woman said he took her to his remote cabin for lunch and insisted they watch a movie. He then tried to kiss her and when she told him to stop, he exposed his genitals. The mother managed to escape the lodge in Heber, Utah after showing Peterson that she had a holstered gun. Scroll down for video . Political power: Gregory Nathan Peterson (right) with Representative Jason Chaffetz during a Republican rally at his log cabin in Heber, Utah . Fear: Haley Hayes (left) said she met Peterson at a Mormon singles event but had been scared by his behavior. She is not connected with the case in any way . The latest victim came forward on Monday after four other women had accused the Republican stalwart of sexual assault. Peterson, from Orem City, Utah, is due to appear at district court in Salt Lake City this morning to begin a two-day hearing. Defiant: Peterson in court today for a preliminary hearing to see if he will stand trial for rape . The judge will decide whether he will stand trial on 23 charges including rape, assault and kidnapping. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, in March 2011 Peterson allegedly raped a woman he attended church with at his cabin in Heber after she had agreed to go to a movie with him. Peterson drove her to his home after threatening her with a gun allegedly stored in the glove compartment. Four months later, the GOP activist allegedly struck again after taking a woman to a movie in the city of Sandy, Utah. He then threatened to expose her for having an expired immigration visa before driving her to his cabin and raping her. After that he forced her to go to his mother's house where he continued to assault her for two days. In December 2011, Peterson then reportedly turned to online dating sites to find his victims. After setting up a lunch date with one woman, he turned up at her home in West Jordan and sexually assaulted her. This April, he met another woman through . a dating site and attempted to attack her in the bedroom of her Salt . Lake City home before she managed to fight him off. Attack: An interior shot of Peterson's cabin where he allegedly carried out the assaults . Remote: Peterson's cabin in Heber, Utah where he allegedly raped women after taking them on dates . Wealth: One woman came forward to say she had been sexually assaulted by Peterson last summer but they did not have enough evidence to act . Peterson has been held on $750,000 bail at Salt Lake County jail since July 18. Peterson often used his cabin to hold Republican events which were attended by the GOP elite including Senator Orrin Hatch, Governor Gary Herbert, Representative Jason Chaffetz and congressional candidate Mia Love. The 37-year-old accountant has been deeply involved in GOP events in Utah. After receiving an MBA at Brigham . Young University, he went on to set up Peterson Wealth Management and . online trading site smartstocks.com. He . used his business connections to organize the Rocky Mountain .

Accused: Peterson is due to appear in court today in Salt Lake City where it will be decided if he is to be tried on 23 charges including rape, assault and kidnapping . Defense attorney Cara Tangaro said that she would present information at Peterson's hearing 'about the strength, or lack thereof, of this case'. Three more women have also come forward to say that they were abused by Peterson but no charges have been filed although public prosecutors were not ruling it out. GOP members had distanced themselves from Peterson since the allegations emerged. Emails to the Utah Republican Party by MailOnline went unanswered. Shortly after Peterson was charged in July, one female acquaintance, who met the 37-year-old at a Mormon church singles event, said he had aggressively pursued her to go to his cabin. Haley Hayes told KLS: 'He really did corner me for an hour and a half.

"Researchers have discovered that although many women assume they know exactly what turns them on, their brains and their lady bits often disagree. Scientists at Indiana University's Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, used a 'vaginal photoplethysmograph'- a small glass tampon-shaped instrument that measures sexual arousal by blood flow - to demonstrate this mind-body disconnect. Writer Melanie Berliet, 33, based in New York City, underwent the test herself and discovered some surprising discrepancies between what she believed she found sexy, and what her nether regions responded to. Are we kidding ourselves? The Kinsey Institute used a 'glass, tampon-shaped' probe that measures sexual arousal, and found discrepancies between what women think turns them on, and what actually does . 'I've always thought of myself as self-aware sexually,' Miss Berliet writes for Cosmopolitan. 'I consider myself a non-judgmental heterosexual woman who enjoys various positions and toys and is open to the possibility of a threesome if the urge strikes.' In the interests of the experiment, Miss Berliet was required to insert the probe into her vagina and seat herself on a leather chair while various erotic and non-erotic video clips were played before her. Erick Janssen, PhD - whose work in sexual pleasure has reportedly earned him the monkier Dr. Feel Good - and evolutionary biologist Justin R. Garcia, PhD, both leading the study, were controlling the videos from a separate room. 'The probe looked and felt like a glass tampon, so it was easy to forget that it was inside me,' Miss Berliet tells MailOnline. The device, she explains, measures blood flow to the surrounding tissue, or the 'pulse' of the vagina, which indicates arousal. 'It was definitely a challenge to stay still, but overall I was comfortable. Since I was focused on watching porn, any discomfort I might have felt was probably eclipsed by the graphic imagery inches from my face.' Quite the experience: Writer Melanie Berliet (right) underwent the test, and although she assumed that footage of a threesome would turn her on and bondage would not, her nether regions responded in the opposite fashion. Pictured (left) Erick Janssen, PhD, who conducted the study . As Dr Janssen explains, arousal is made up from a balance between two brain systems; sexual excitation, 'your gas pedal', and sexual inhibition, 'your breaks'. Miss Berliet was exposed to wide range of visual stimuli; from 'neutralizing' kitten videos and scenes from uplifting films, to hard-core porn and a disturbing clip from The Silence of the Lambs. For each video, she was asked to rate her emotional responses - excitement, relaxation, fright, sadness, guilt and shame, for example - on a five-point scale. Miss Berliet then told researchers, off the top of her head, that she was generally aroused by concepts including lesbian sex, a threesome and female masturbation. She also declared some concepts that she didn't consider arousing; homosexual male sex, foot fetishism and bonobo monkeys mating, for example. After sourcing video clips relevant to Miss Berliet's preferences, she was invited to view them and rate how aroused each clip made her feel on a scale of one to ten. This created some mental conflicts. 'As a proponent of gay rights, for instance, I wanted to be turned on by sex between men, but I found the sight of two erect penises off-putting. 'And as much as I wanted to believe that neither animals nor feet could excite me, I had to concede a minimal level of attraction to both.' The lab: Miss Berliet was required to insert the vaginal probe (right) and recline on a leather chair (left) where she was exposed to a wide variety of visual stimuli via video . A few days later, the results were in, and the researchers told Miss Berliet that her 'vaginal pulse' was strongest when she watched lesbian sex, bondage, foot fetishism, and female masturbation. This was contradictory to how she recorded feeling at the time, when she said the bondage footage had turned her off. According to the probe's results, Miss Berliet was least turned on while watching the bonobos clip - as expected - but also the threesome footage, which she had rated as turning her on to a degree of seven out of ten. A vaginal photoplethysmograph is a small glass tampon-shaped instrument that measures blood flow to the surrounding tissue. Using this data, the probe determines the 'pulse' of the vagina, which indicates sexual arousal. This was 'alarming' she notes. In regards to the bondage footage, which she had claimed didn't arouse her but according to the probe, did, she writes: 'Perhaps I've been conditioned to associate domination by a man as anti-feminist, so my conscious mind couldn't embrace BDSM as eagerly as my vagina. 'Our guilt, shame, and social pressures can interrupt our ability to decipher our real sexual desires.' Another surprising finding was that Miss Berliet had a stronger sexual response to the clip from The Silence of the Lambs than she did when watching rom-com footage. This is not uncommon, according to Dr Janssen. Miss Berliet notes that watching scary movies does make her crave 'cuddling and protection' from her boyfriend. A few weeks later, she and her boyfriend watched a thriller together and sure enough, 'it did the trick.' In summary, Miss Berliet remarks, her adventure with the 'magical glass tampon' opened up her mind and led her to challenge previous assumptions she had regarding her turn-ons. 'I was surprised to learn that it's important to pay equal attention to what turns you off as what turns you on,' she tells MailOnline. 'People tend to think about arousal as purely a matter of what excites them, but sexual inhibitors are just as relevant as excitation factors.' She adds: 'I learned that it can take a lot of introspection and experimentation to figure these out, even for those of us who consider ourselves open-minded from a sexual standpoint.' This particular experiment was conducted only on women, so we can only guess to what degree men might be subconsciously repressing or openly embracing their sexual preferences. Miss Berliet doubts that gender is a factor. 'I think it's time to debunk the popular narrative that men are naturally more sexual than women,' she says. 'And I don't imagine that women are more likely to repress their turn-ons. 'I think sexual tastes depend less upon our biologically assigned gender and more upon who we are as individuals.'","The Kinsey Institute in Indiana used a 'glass, tampon-shaped' probe that measures sexual arousal .

"A bonfire society has been criticised for burning a 'distasteful and disrespectful effigy' of Remembrance poppies. Rye Bonfire Society burned a huge poppy display during their November 5 celebrations, leaving many spectators stunned. The fire club, based in the East Sussex town, claim the display was torched to commemorate the centenary of the First World War. But many visitors were appalled at seeing the ten-foot-tall poppies being put to the torch during the annual Bonfire Night event. Visitors were left shocked after an 'effigy' of poppies was burnt at a bonfire event in Rye, East Sussex . Nakita Manlow, who attended the event, said: 'I am appalled at the choice of effigy. Not only was it distasteful but disrespectful too. 'If their intention was to celebrate the WW1 centenary, Rye Bonfire Society were short-sighted. There was no consideration to the way this would have been inferred by others.' The local branch of the Royal British Legion also condemned the burning. President Colonel Anthony Kimber said: 'I raised the issue with officers of the Rye Bonfire Society. I was reassured that the purpose was to mark and remember. 'I did not witness the burning but envisaged what might happen. 'In my view the national symbol of Remembrance could have been given a prominent position at the event without destroying the display. 'There are differing views of Remembrance, but to burn the symbol of sacrifice and Remembrance was, at best, naive and ill-judged.' While many were disgusted by the burning, some locals leapt to the defence of the society. Barry Thomas, from Hastings, said: 'I was heartened to see the respectful commemoration.' Organisers said: 'The tableaux was lit by red lances only and was not exploded, this was not an effigy' Visitors to the event said they were shocked by the move, which was branded 'distasteful and disrespectful' Tim Fellows added: 'Poppies in fireworks have been a feature of bonfire since the 1920's. 'As a descendant of a number of Bonfire Boys who gave their lives for this country, I am shocked at the criticism of Rye Bonfire Society in paying a tribute.' Rye Bonfire Society issued a statement on Monday, which said: 'The tableaux - created to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War - was made in remembrance and to raise the profile of the Poppy Appeal and the good work the British Legion does. 'The Tableaux was lit by red lances only and was not exploded, this was not an effigy. 'Rye Bonfire was not making a protest, nor was it making any statement other than to highlight Remembrance, and we very much regret any offence this may have caused. 'The fact the tableaux was burned after discharge had no intended significance, any thinking differently that this was anything but an act of remembrance is regrettable. 'Rye Bonfire supports the Rye branch of the Royal British Legion in helping with the Remembrance Day service organisation and through donations and will continue to do so.' The Sussex town has a long history of bonfire burning, which they say goes back to the time of the Vikings .

But up to a third of these will have to pay off debts first, while a fifth are saving for a bigger house before doing so. The Debt Advisory Centre said two-thirds of respondents admitted personal finances played a part in deciding when to have children, while a fifth felt this was central to their decision. Ian Williams, of the DAC, said: ‘Sadly, for millions of people, deciding when to have children has become a financial decision. ‘Do they have space? Can they afford to a bigger place? Will they be able to afford their existing commitments if they lose an income or pay for childcare? ‘Paying off debts is sensible, although it’s surprising to see that so many people are having to take this step.’ The survey questioned 2,000 adults, of which 270 expressed a desire to have children in the future. A separate study released yesterday showed that by talking about financial worries remained a ‘taboo’ subject among reserved Britons. Legal & General launched a campaign called the ‘Great British Money Taboo’ to encourage people to discuss money and plan for their financial future. Research found two fifths of the population said their money was one of the biggest stresses in their lives, but half it was a personal matter and should not be talked about. Financial worries placed the greatest pressure on family life, the study found, but also affected people’s moods and their ability to sleep at night. Researchers found that couples worry about whether they have space to add to their families, file photo .","One in seven UK adults is considering starting or adding to their family .

"Primary schoolchildren as young as four should attend ‘savings clubs’ to teach them how to handle money responsibly, the Church of England said. The proposal aims to prevent them relying on controversial payday lenders or racking up heavy debts later in life. Under the plans, children would be able to save small, regular amounts of money, and would be given the chance to help to run the groups, working as junior cashiers or ‘bank managers’. The Church of England proposal aims to prevent children relying on controversial payday lenders or racking up heavy debts later in life. It would see children as young as four attend 'savings clubs' (file picture, posed) Parents and school staff could also sign up to the clubs, with mothers and fathers able to set up dedicated accounts to save for particular expenses such as trips and school uniform. The proposals – which would be piloted in Church of England primary schools – have been drawn up by the Archbishop of Canterbury's new task Group on responsible credit and savings. They are now looking for funding from the government and private companies for the pilot scheme, which would run in six schools over nine months before being rolled out further. Last year, Most Rev Justin Welby criticised payday lender Wonga without realising the Church had indirectly invested £75,000 through its investment arm. Mr Welby later acknowledged it was ‘very embarrassing’ to learn of the investment and the Church announced earlier this year it had severed its ties with the payday lender. Now, the Archbishop hopes the proposals can help people to avoid payday lenders – which charge astronomical interest on short-term loans – by teaching them to be careful with their finances from an early age. The Church said it was focusing on savings clubs in primary schools partly because it is responsible for one in four primaries in England and also because financial education is already part of the national curriculum for secondaries. The Archbishop, Most Rev Justin Welby, hopes it will help people avoid payday lenders by teaching them to be careful with finances from an early age . The savings clubs would be given ‘seed’ funding of £1 per child per term for the first year for all youngsters who want to join and take part, the Church said. Sir Hector Sants, the former chief executive of the Financial Services Authority and chair of the task group, said: ‘Savings clubs can transform lives through helping establish a responsible approach to money from an early age.’ The Church wants the savings clubs to be hosted by credit unions, small financial co-operatives set up by local communities and other groups such as trade unions. Because there are no shareholders and they are not driven by profit, credit unions can offer very low interest rates – on average 12 per cent a year – for those seeking loans to tide them over in financial difficulties. A report yesterday said savings clubs in schools can be a good way to improve children's financial knowledge. The Children's Society said research found nearly two-thirds of children get their first bank or building society account before they start secondary school, while nearly three-quarters of 15-year-olds with a bank account have a debit card. The charity said: ‘With children making financial choices at an even younger age, and regularly exposed to advertisements for credit, it has never been so important to ensure that children learn about debt and money management from an early age.’ The Church said four years old was not too young to attend savings club because ‘many young children have piggy banks’. They added: ‘It is entirely optional both for children and schools. ‘At that very young age, they can’t help run the banks, but can bring in pennies to deposit.’","Church of England said children from four should attend 'savings clubs'

"This is the nail-biting moment an eight-year-old elephant manages beat off a savage attack by 14 hungry lionesses. The near-three minute fight - captured on film by safari-goers in the South Luangwa National Park, Zambia - shows the feisty herbivore surrounded by predators near a watering hole. As the lions viciously set about the tusked mammal - who was separated from its herd - they begin taking it in turns to leap on its back and sink their teeth into its body. Jesse Nash, a New York-based journalist who witnessed the event, told MailOnline that he was desperate to go and help but knew that would be 'breaking the rules of nature.' 'We were on safari as observers, witnessing a cycle of life that is, at times, very cruel,' he added. In the video, Nash and other bystanders - including Long Island University art professor Dan Christoffel, British naturalist Steve Baker and Australian travel writer Nina Karnikowski - are heard encouraging the the elephant to 'Go on fight back!' In a bid to shrug off its attackers, the quick-thinking elephant darts into the water. However, the lions don't seem too fazed by the wet and several of them bound into the shallow depths.

"The owner of the hotel where a young woman was murdered in a reported act of cannibalism has spoken of the moment she walked in to find the blood-spattered killer leaning over and staring at his mutilated victim. Mandy Miles, who owns the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Argoed, south Wales, said she looked into Matthew Williams's 'black eyes' and would have attacked him with a fire extinguisher had Cerys Yemm, 22, still been alive. Mrs Miles said she had gone up to the room because her son told her Williams, 34, had a woman in there, which is against the hotel's rules. Scroll down for video . Mandy Miles outside the Sirhowy Arms Hotel where Cerys Yemm was brutally murdered and cannibalised last week has described the horrific moment she walked in on the killer and his mutilated victim . Loss: Cerys Yemm, 22, was killed and mutilated by Matthew Williams, 34, at the Argoed hotel . Little could she have imagined the sickening sight when she opened the door to confront him. She said: 'The amount of blood and the stillness of her, there were no signs of life at that point. 'I said to Matthew ""do you know what you're doing to that girl?"" His chilling reply? 'That's no girl.' Mrs Miles, who is studying for a degree in criminology and psychology, said : 'He was leaning over her. Miss Yemm, who worked in sales at Next, is believed to have met Williams through mutual friends . 'Who in their right mind would just carry on leaning and looking down? 'With me walking in would make you stand up, it would make you lift your head. That told me he didn't know what he was doing.' And she said that she was given no information about Williams by the authorities before he moved in. Ms Yemm died in the hotel in Argoed, near Blackwood, last week. She had substantial injuries. Williams also died at the scene after he was Tasered by police. Mrs Miles said she saw broken china in the room and injuries to Miss Yemm's neck and jaw . Williams had taken a cocktail of mind-bending drugs and told friends he was hearing voices and hallucinating before attacking Miss Yemm and reportedly biting off parts of her face. Miss Yemm, who worked in sales at Next, is believed to have met Williams through mutual friends. Mrs Miles said she saw broken china in the room and  injuries to Miss Yemm's neck and jaw. 'I had to decide what the hell was going on and then I had residents behind me in danger,' she added. 'I rang 999 and I made damn well sure he couldn't get out of that room. It was the fear of what he was capable of. He didn't recognise me and he didn't recognise what he was doing. 'I was holding onto the door knob so he couldn't get out. I couldn't let him flee the scene. 'The police then came upstairs and took over. 'If that girl had been alive, I couldn't have closed the door, I would've had to attack Matthew with the fire extinguisher.' Mrs Miles added that Williams had told her he had been in prison for theft, rather than assaulting an ex-partner and has now called for more information to be shared between agencies so that she knows people's backgrounds before she accepts them as residents. 'It's worrying, it's terrifying,' she added. 'I need to know who is walking through my door. Someone needs to give me a bit of a heads up and people's backgrounds. 'If they've come from prison, I think I personally should be told what's happened.' Mrs Miles also said she plans to seal off the room as no one will ever want to stay there. She added: 'I can never use that room again. Not for anything. I'm going to have the door removed, it'll be an open room. I wouldn't expect anyone to want to be in that room.' A Home Office pathologist has carried out initial tests on the victim and have indicated the cause of Ms Yemm's death as headwounds. But they are continuing to carry out a series of further tests on Cerys before an inquest is heard. A Gwent police spokeswoman said: 'The initial post-mortem results for Cerys Yemm indicate that she died from head injuries. 'However it may take a number of weeks before the post-mortem is completed.'","Mandy Miles said she would have attacked Matthew Williams, 34, with a fire extinguisher if she believed she could have saved Cerys Yemm, 22 .

"Family doctors should start prescribing gardening to patients, a Government health advisor will say today. Dr William Bird, who advises Public Health England on physical activity, says the NHS should acknowledge the power of the great outdoors as a medical treatment. The expert, who has 30 years’ experience as a GP in Reading, will today call for fellow doctors to start using community gardening schemes to tackle disease. Addressing the Royal Horticultural Society in London tomorrow evening, Dr Bird will outline recent evidence that suggests contact with green space can have a dramatic impact on health. Speaking to the Daily Mail before his speech, he claimed every £1 spent on access to community outdoor schemes could save the health service £5 in other treatments. Dr William Bird, who advises Public Health England, says the NHS should acknowledge the power of gardening and the great outdoors, as a medical treatment. (File picture) Dr Bird said: ‘We are programmed as humans to be hunter gatherers, to live outdoors, we are not really adapted to urban life. ‘A dose of green space, really connecting people back to nature, can make a huge difference. ‘Blood pressure reduces, muscle tension reduces, all of these happen within moments of going into a park or a garden. ‘Reducing stress has been shown to make a significant difference in all kinds of ways.’ He added: ‘Horticultural or garden therapy includes a broad range of treatment options in various kinds of settings, spanning from care of single plants to walks in wilderness areas. ‘Even indoor plants have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mental health.’ One group of GPs in Newham, East London, has started funding placements for 12-week ‘community prescription’ outdoor exercise programmes for those at risk of type two diabetes. Dr Bird, who also advises the World Health Organisation, called for similar programmes to be funded for other outdoor schemes including walking groups and gardening programmes. Gardening, country runs or simply a stroll in the park can have a dramatic impact on health, he said. Dementia, type two diabetes and heart disease can be both prevented and treated with outdoor therapy, he said. Studies have shown that the stress-relieving impact of access to nature is profound, playing an obvious role in improving mental health. Green spaces also increase physical activity, reducing the risk of obesity, type two diabetes and heart disease. And stimulating senses such as touch, smell and hearing in the garden has been shown to be an effective therapy for dementia patients. Dr Bird said doctors have not yet accepted that something so simple can be more effective than drugs. Outlining evidence that nature has a profound impact on the body and mind, he said: ‘If gardening and a drug have the same effect as drugs on prevention of diabetes, for example, they should be compared objectively rather than choosing the drug simply because it is more familiar in the NHS. ‘There are considerable savings to be made if we really managed to get horticulture therapy up to the standard of other health interventions - then we could see benefits of at least £5 health benefit for every £1 spent.’ Dr Bird will be joined on stage tonight by Dr Matilda Van Den Bosch, a Swedish researcher who has looked at the impact of green space on mental and physical health. Her research, published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour, suggests the sounds of nature alone - wind whistling through the trees and a bubbling stream - reduces levels of the stress hormone cortisol in humans. A second study by Dr Van Den Bosch, published in the Scandinavian Journal of Public Health, concluded that simply giving people access to green space could help reduce the impact of a range of diseases. Her paper, which summarised 38 separate pieces of clinical research, said: ‘Significant improvements were found for varied outcomes in diverse diagnoses, spanning for obesity to schizophrenia. ‘Nature-assisted therapy [is] a relevant resource for public health.’ Scientists have long known that chronic stress increases risk of heart disease and stroke. But there is a growing school of thought that stress can also increase inflammation of cells, which is thought to play a role in diabetes and dementia. Dr Van Den Bosch, from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, said: ‘Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, mental health problems - these are not easy problems to treat. ‘It is much more effective to act earlier to stop them occurring in the first place, and access to green spaces can do that.’","Dr William Bird says NHS should acknowledge the power of the great outdoors as a medical treatment .

"It's a highly-anticipated deal that keeps his nation from teetering over the edge of the fiscal cliff - yet President Obama has not even shown up to sign the new bill into law. Instead, Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii, has signed the bill using an autopen, a mechanical device that copies his signature - allowing him to accept the deal after playing a round of golf. While he's the only president in history to turn to the gadget to sign a bill into law, it is not the first time President Obama has used it. In May 2011, he used the pen to sign the Patriot Act - extending anti-terrorism measures enacted in the wake of 9/11 - while he was 3,725 miles and six time zones away in France at a G8 meeting. Scroll down for video . Back in Hawaii: President Obama boarded Air Force One to return to the Aloha State yesterday - moments after he addressed the nation following the House's approval of the fiscal cliff deal . President Barack Obama signed the law before midnight, using an auto pen as he traveled to Africa for ceremonies honoring the late South African President Nelson Mandela . In that instance, Mr Obama was awoken at 5.45am in his hotel room in Deauville, France, so that he could review and approve the bill with only minutes to spare before the deadline passed in the U.S. He also used the device in November 2011 while he was holding talks with Asian/Pacific leaders in Bali in Indonesia; he signed an appropriations bill to fund government departments in his absence. The fiscal cliff bill was approved on a sunny day in Honolulu during which the president played a round of golf at a Marine Corps base in nearby Kaneohe. In between the round of golf, working out at the local gum and dining with his wife and friends, Obama reviewed a copy of the legislation and ordered that the original be signed by autopen in D.C. Smirk: Obama winks at photographers as he arrives in the briefing room to make remarks after the House passed legislation intended to avoid the fiscal cliff . After months of wrangling, the deal was . finally reached after Obama cut his family vacation short last week, . returning to Washington D.C. on December 26 for the negotiations. But after addressing the nation following the House's passage of the fiscal cliff deal, Obama jetted back to the Aloha State late on Tuesday night. He arrived in Honolulu . before 5am local time yesterday and immediately rejoined the First Family in their . rented beachside vacation home in Kailua, a picturesque suburb . on the east side of Oahu. After Obama used the autopen to sign the . Patriot Act in 2011, critics claimed using the mechanical device to . write his signature was unconstitutional. Article 1, Section 7 of the . constitution states that if a bill is passed by both the House and . Senate, it shall be presented to the president. 'If he approve(s) he . shall sign it,' states the Constitution. President Barack Obama's REAL signature..... .... and the autopen signature . Conservative critics have claimed that using the autopen for a president to write his signature is unconstitutional. Article 1, Section 7 of the . constitution states that if a bill is passed by both the House and . Senate, it shall be presented to the president. 'If he approve(s) he . shall sign it,' states the Constitution. There is nothing in the document that suggests a reasonable facsimile affixed by an appliance will do just as well. But in 2005, the Justice . Department's Office of Legal Counsel deemed the use of the autopen constitution, ruling that 'the President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill to sign it'. The autopen is often used by politicians and celebrities to duplicate signatures for letters. Obama is the first president to use the device to sign a bill into law, but Harry Truman, Thomas Jefferson and Gerald Ford are also known to have used the autopen. There is nothing in the document that suggests a reasonable facsimile affixed by an appliance will do just as well. But the White House sidestepped the . constitutional requirement by citing a 2005 opinion from the Justice . Department's Office of Legal Counsel. It concluded that 'the President need . not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a . bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become . law'. In the White House's view, it does . not make a difference that one bill is really signed by the president . and the other bears a look-alike signature, and it rejected calls for . him to re-sign the Act. The autopen has been called into question in other cases; in 2004, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld met criticism for using an autopen to sign condolence letters to the families of fallen troops. And in 1992 then-Vice President Dan Quayle was lambasted for using the autopen on official correspondence during an appearance on 'This Week with David Brinkley'. Harry Truman, Thomas Jefferson and Gerald Ford are also known to have used the autopen, yet Obama is the first president to have used it to sign a bill into law. The fiscal cliff agreement boosts taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while preserving tax cuts for most American households. Questions: Obama, pictured signs a book at the Japanese Embassy in Washington, DC, March 17, 2011, has come under fire for using the autopen, which some say are unconstitutional . Working holiday: Obama is staying in Kailua, Hawaii (pictured) and played golf the day the bill was passed . The bill, which averts a looming . fiscal cliff that had threatened to plunge the nation back into . recession, also extends expiring jobless benefits, prevents cuts in . Medicare reimbursements to doctors and delays for two months billions of . dollars in across-the-board spending cuts in defense and domestic . programs. The . Republican-controlled House gave final legislative approval Tuesday . night to a package that avoids income tax increases for most Americans . and delays for two months billions in across-the-board spending cuts. Minutes later, Obama appeared in the White House briefing room to praise the deal in an eight-minute speech. 'And I hope that everybody now gets at . least a day off, I guess, or a few days off, so that people can refresh . themselves, because we're going to have a lot of work to do in 2013,' he . said. Family vacation: Obama and his wife Michelle visited military personnel eating Christmas Dinner at Marine Corps Base Hawaii on December 25 in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii . The fiscal cliff deal delays by two months billions in scheduled in spending cuts. It also sets up battles between Democrats and Republicans over federal spending and debt. The first showdowns will come over the next three months, when the government's legal ability to borrow money expires and temporary financing for federal agency budgets will lapse. Republicans have already said, as they did in 2011, that they will demand spending cuts as a condition for extending the debt ceiling. Obama also faces decisions over Cabinet appointments, with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta expected to leave.","Obama is the only president in history to use autopen to sign bills into law .

"An RAF fighter pilot who took part in the first dog fight of the Second World War and was the last survivor of the Battle of France has died at the age of 93. Wing Commander Peter Ayerst DFC survived combat operations in the Battle of France, Battle of Britain, El Alamein and D-Day. In October 1939 he became the first RAF pilot to come into combat with a German fighter plane - and that was by accident. Wing Commander Peter Ayerst, who died on Thursday, May 15, survived combat operations in the Battle of France, Battle of Britain, El Alamein and D-Day . Mr Ayerst flew throughout the Second World War and took part in the first dog fight of the conflict . While on a patrol over France, at the age of 19, he momentarily flew off in the wrong direction. After a while he found what he thought was the rest of his French squadron and flew in behind the nine planes. He realised however they were Messerschmit 109s after he noticed the black cross of the Luftwaffe on the tail fins. He gave a short burst of fire before diving out of the way. Another 18 Messerschmits arrived as did the rest of Wg Cdr Ayerst's patrol and the first combat of the war broke out. Wg Cdr Ayerst went on to rack up more hours in a Spitfire than any other flyer bar one and that was the chief test pilot for manufacturers Vickers Armstrong.

Wg Cdr Ayerst, who shot down nine enemy aircraft during the Second World War, was the last surviving British fighter pilot to take part in the Battle of France. He died on Thursday, May 15, in a care home in Beckenham, Kent. Family and friends have paid tribute to the RAF veteran who is said to have defied the odds to survive the war due to his great skill at flying. His granddaughter Gemma Baggot said: 'Peter enjoyed spending time with all the family, and enjoyed a lovely glass of red wine, or a good gin and tonic whilst talking over good times. 'Peter was also a fervent rugby fan all his life, having played as a centre in his younger years. Wg Cdr Ayerst (third from left) was the last surviving British fighter pilot to take part in the Battle of France . Family and friends have paid tribute to the RAF veteran who is said to have defied the odds to survive the war due to his great skill at flying . 'I certainly will remember him as a man with a zest for life, and who always had a cheeky glint in his eye, and who was quietly proud of all he achieved.' In an interview before his death, Wg Cdr Ayerst recalled the day he came face to face with the enemy. He said: 'I was the first RAF fighter pilot ever to come into combat with a Messerschmit 109. 'On that day our squadron were the . first offensive fighter patrol of the war. As I was turning around to come . back to France, underneath me I saw nine aircraft in line. 'I thought ""here come our boys on this patrol"". In 1944 he was awarded the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross for his gallantry and devotion to duty . 'I joined in formation, tagged on the end and saw bloody great black crosses. So I pulled up and gave a quick squirt at the enemy and went down. 'Unbeknown to me there were another 18 of them making 27 altogether.' Of surviving the entire war, he said: 'One stayed with it, got through it and, if you were lucky, came out the other side.' Wg Cdr Ayerst underwent advanced flying training in Lincolnshire in 1939 and achieved a short service commission to the RAF. He flew Hawker Hurricanes in 73 Squadron which was based in Rouves, northern France, from October 1939 through to the fall of France in May 1940. After returning to Britain he was based in Cheshire, teaching young fighter pilots aerial warfare. During one lesson in August 1940 - the height of the Battle of Britain - his services were called upon when a German Heinkel bomber appeared in the skies. He and two other pilots took off and shot the plane down. Years later Wg Cdr Ayerst met two members of the German crew who thanked him for helping them survive the war by being captured. In 1942 he was posted to North Africa and flew Spitfires and Hurricanes, intercepting enemy aircraft. On his 22nd birthday on November 4, 1942, his plane was cut down by German flak and he crash landed on a road. It was too risky to walk across the desert by day to find his squadron, so he waited until dark. Just as he set off an Australian army . truck pulled up and an officer told him to get in immediately as he was . about to walk through a darkened minefield. He took to the skies again in the aftermath of D-Day. Wg Cdr Ayerst flew Hawker Hurricanes in 73 Squadron which was based in Rouves, northern France, from October 1939 through to the fall of France in May 1940 . Wg Cdr Ayerst's biographer, Hugh Thomas, said: 'For Peter to survive through four major air theatres of the war, he must have been a very special pilot. 'Many pilots could fly a Spitfire but very few could make them dance and that is what Peter could do. 'I can't think of any other pilots who spent more time in Spitfires other than Peter and Alex Henshaw, who was the chief test pilot for Vickers. 'Peter flew in and tested all the Spitfires, from Mark I to Mark 22. 'I am very sad to hear that he has died not least because Peter has been a close friend of mine. There are few people you meet who make a difference to your life but Peter was one of them.' Andy Saunders, a military aviation historian, said: 'Peter Ayerst was one of the first RAF fighter pilots to see action in World War Two but was remarkable in seeing action in the Battle of France, Battle of Britain, El Alamein, Normandy landings, Arnhem and offensive sweeps into the Ruhr. 'The odds were stacked against surviving just one of those campaigns - let alone seeing action, on and off, for most of the war. 'In his career as a fighter pilot he destroyed nine enemy aircraft, probably destroyed two more and damaged four. 'He was an amazing man, and immensely modest - as well as being a true gentleman. His passing is a great loss to the aviation community.' Wg Cdr Ayerst was married to wife Betty who died in 2001. They had one daughter, Jane, and two grandchildren, James and Gemma.","Wing Commander Peter Ayerst flew throughout the Second World War .

"Police have launched an investigation after finding $3 million worth of missing shoes at a central Kentucky home. Officers with the Radcliff Police Department confiscated thousands of pairs of Nike shoes that were scattered in front of the home for a yard sale. According to a search warrant filed last week, the shoes were supposed to be shipped in 2009 from a Nike distribution center in Tennessee to another one in Texas, but never made it. Police are investigating after finding $3 million worth of missing NIkes at a central Kentucky home (library image) The women who were in possession of the shoes said they had purchased them from someone else and didn't know they were stolen. They said they were selling them at a flea market for $5 a pair. 'Apparently Nike had called and contacted them and the shoes were stolen and they had been stolen since 2009 and there was $3 million worth of shoes in my front yard', the seller told WLKY-TV. The seller's daughter was apparently wearing a pair of Air Jordans from the collection and said: 'I can't even tell you how many shoes we had, it was unbelievable. 'There were flip flops, there was Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian heels... Expensive shoes.' She added that they were making $200 every two hours from the sales. No arrests have been made and police are still investigating.","Thousands of pairs of Nikes were found at the Kentucky home .

"At least 35 Disney World employees have been arrested since 2006 over alleged child sex offences, an investigation has revealed. The suspects included a ticket seller, a concierge and a trainee tour guide at the Florida resort - and even a night shift manager accused of watching child porn at work while he wrote a church sermon. Police caught many in stings modelled on the TV show To Catch a Predator, with undercover officers receiving explicit messages before the suspects agreed to meet at a home rigged with cameras. Scroll down for videos . Trapped: At least 35 Disney World employees have been arrested over child sex offences, an investigation has revealed. Pictured: 40-year-old Allen Treaster, a Disney concierge accused of trying to meet a 14-year-old boy . Interview: Allen Treaster being questioned on camera. The total was revealed in an investigation by CNN . Caught: Treaster at the police 'sting house'. He was arrested two weeks ago and faces five child sex charges . The latest round of arrests last week netted another 13 suspects, including four who at some point worked at the sprawling Magic Kingdom. Disney has insisted the theme park is so large, with around 70,000 employees, that those arrested represent only 0.01 per cent of people it has employed since 2006. But Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said paedophiles have obvious reasons for wanting to work at the resort and wants compulsory 'lie detector' polygraph tests for staff to be made legal. The toll of Disney workers arrested was revealed after a six-month investigation by CNN's Kyra Phillips and Scott Zamost. They tracked down many of the suspects still facing trial including 50-year-old Robert Kingsolver, who was employed as a ride repair worker by Disney when he was arrested in February. Charged: Disney concierge Allen Treaster, 40, accused of explicit chats with a '14-year-old boy' (left), and ticket supervisor Zachary Spencer, 26 (right) who police say sent explicit messages to a '13-year-old boy' Toll: Arrested earlier this year were Walt Disney World employees Robert Kingsolver . (left), 49, and Joel Torres (right), 32. Both were lured to a house by detectives thinking they would meet a child for sex, police said . Interview: A tearful Kingsolver told CNN he was not guilty and said his family knew he was not a predator . He faces two charges of soliciting a child to commit a sex act after Lake County police say he tried to meet up with a 14-year-old girl. Kingsolver - who has pleaded not guilty - told CNN he was trying to protect the girl from further harm, was not a predator and loved working at the resort. 'To see the look on the childrens' faces when they get to see Prince Charming or run in to Mickey, that was the best part, to see kids glow, seeing their heroes,' he said. 'They know how much I love them, all four of my kids, and they know their dad is not somebody who would go out and hurt a young child.' Many more of those tracked down, however, were reluctant to appear on camera. One of those arrested in Polk County Police's latest crackdown was 26-year-old Zachary Spencer, a ticket supervisor at the Magic Kingdom. 'Spencer initiated contact with an . undercover detective via a social networking site', police said in a statement last week. Arrested: One of those from Universal Studios caught in the latest sting was 23-year-old Matthew Cody Myers - who told detectives he had also previously worked in food service at Disney, and at Sea World . Arrested: Matthew Cody Myers (left) and Timothy Lucas, 20 (right) who was accused of sending a photo of his penis to a detective he thought was a 13-year-old girl. Lucas said Disney fired him two weeks before his arrest . 'The undercover . detective told Spencer he was a 13-year-old boy. Spencer initiate . sexually explicit messages to a person he thought was a 13-year-old boy, . including mutual oral sex. 'The suspect travelled to the undercover location and was arrested.' He faces five separate charges, as does 40-year-old Allen Treaster, who worked as a concierge at Disney's Animal Kingdom. Police arrested Treaster two weeks ago on suspicion of sending explicit messages to an officer he thought was a 14-year-old boy. 'He admitted to chatting about performing oral sex on the ""boy."" Treaster said that it has always been a fantasy of his to have . sex with a 14 year old boy' - Polk County Police . 'He admitted to deputies that he travelled to . meet a 14-year-old boy to see where things would lead to and was hoping . for sex,' police said. 'He admitted to chatting about performing oral sex on the ""boy."" Treaster said that it has always been a fantasy of his to have . sex with a 14 year old boy.' Police are also investigating an alleged confession by Treaster that he previously had sex with a 15-year-old boy in a Georgia motel. The CNN investigation found far more . child sex arrests at Disney than at Universal Studios, which had five, . or SeaWorld, which had two. One . of those from Universal caught in the latest sting was 23-year-old . Matthew Cody Myers - who told detectives he had previously worked in . food service at Disney, and at Sea World. 'Myers . engaged in an online conversation with an undercover detective who . identified herself as a 14-year-old girl', police said. 'He admitted to detectives that he solicited . the conversation about sex and came to the residence with the mindset to . have unprotected sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old girl.' Another arrest was of 32-year-old Patrick Holgerson, a Disney employee accused of sending explicit photos to someone he thought was a 13-year-old boy and . his uncle. Popular: A Disney World spokesman said those arrested represented just 0.01 per cent of its staff . Bait: Police in Lake County released videos of a previous sting in February. They defend their aggressive tactics . And 20-year-old Timothy Lucas, arrested two weeks ago, was accused of sending a photo of his penis to a detective he thought was a 13-year-old girl. Lucas told officers Disney had fired him two weeks before his arrest for missing work. Last month a former Disney employee was sentenced to six years' jail after sheriffs accused him of watching child porn at work - while writing an Easter sermon for the church where he was a pastor. Cedric Eugene Cuthbert, 50, was fired by Disney after his crimes were exposed. Ruthless: Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd wants compulsory lie detector tests made legal . In all, the 35 Disney suspects since . 2006 named by CNN are charges with various offences ranging mostly from . child pornography and soliciting sex to sexual activity. CNN said of all 42 theme park workers . it examined, 32 had been convicted, eight had pleaded not guilty and two . had not yet entered pleas. The age of consent in Florida is 18. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd has dismissed claims that his aggressive stings amount to entrapment. He wants to be able to give compulsory . 'lie detector' tests to anyone who works around children - including in a church or a nursery - to check they . are not a paedophile. 'Why . do people work at Disney?' he told CNN. 'Well, they work at Disney because they want a . good, stable job for a great company, but there is always a few that . are there because they can see children. They can live in a child's . world.' However, there are concerns around the use of polygraph machines to see if someone is telling the truth - both from civil liberties groups and experts who doubt their accuracy. Disney, Universal Studios and Sea World all said they had the highest standard of background checks and took all allegations seriously. Disney spokesman Jacquee Wahler told CNN in a statement: 'Providing a safe environment for . children and families is a responsibility we take very seriously. 'We . have extensive measures in place, including pre-employment and ongoing . criminal background checks and computer monitoring and firewalls. 'The . numbers reported by CNN represent one one-hundredth of one percent of . the 300,000 people we have employed during this time period. 'We continue . to work closely with law enforcement and organizations like the .

"House Speaker John Boehner has been afforded no rest after the passage of the fiscal cliff bill. He has been forced to put down a revolt by conservatives furious about the $620billion in tax hikes he pushed through the House. He has also been subjected to withering criticism from Republicans in New York and New Jersey - including Governor Chris Christie - for failing to bring a bill with $60billion in Hurricane Sandy to a vote. President Barack Obama, meanwhile, has been vacationing on the sunny beaches of Hawaii - leaving Washington just hours after the deal made it through Congress on Tuesday night. The White House released a series of . year-end photos of the President on Wednesday. The first picture in the . series was of shot of a jubilant Obama frolicking in the warm Hawaiian waters. Scroll down for video . Shaky ground: House Speaker John Boehner faces an uncertain political future following wranglings over the fiscal cliff and further criticism for not pushing a vote on a Sandy relief bill . Wish you were here! This photo of President Barack Obama frolicking in the waves of Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii on January 1, 2012 was released on Wednesday . It's a sneaky move that could be interpreted as twisting the dagger in the embattled Boehner, who is in the midst of fighting for political life in chilly Washington. Boehner appears likely to be re-elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives when the 113th United States Congress is sworn in at midday on Thursday. While some conservatives had said that 20 or more House Republicans were prepared to mount a challenge to Boehner, no one has been willing to step forward as a rallying figure - an indication that the position is in some ways one of the most difficult and thankless in politics. Boehner's job as Speaker had been under threat after just 85 members of his Republican caucus voted for a fiscal cliff deal that 151 opposed and nearly all Democrats backed. Most ominously, his own leadership team publicly split from him over the vote with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy opposing the bill. Embattled: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said today the John Boehner had refused to take his calls last night over the $60bn Sandy relief bill which is desperately needed in his home state . To add to his woes, Boehner - who faces re-election as Speaker on Thursday - had been lambasted by New Jersey's Governor Chris Christie, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, for failing to bring to a vote a $60billion relief bill for those affected by Hurricane Sandy. Governor Christie denounced the 'disappointing and disgusting' spectacle of fiscal cliff manoeuvrings that showed a 'callous indifference' for the people of New Jersey. Christie said on Wednesday: 'I called the Speaker four times last night after 11.20pm and he did not take my calls.' But Boehner was able to placate his House Republicans, most notably the outspoken Representative Peter King of New York, by promising to bring the hurricane relief bill to a vote at the beginning of the new Congress. At one point during the fiscal cliff negotiations, Boehner had been overheard on the House floor saying: 'Am I having a nightmare, or what?' Boehner took the highly unusual step of voting personally for the Senate bill that had passed overwhelmingly in the other house - just as Speaker Schuyler Colfax was portrayed as doing in the movie Lincoln in voting for the 13th Amendment and the end of slavery. Tough talk: Paul Ryan voted for the fiscal cliff deal because it was in the interest of the American people . In another indication of a bitterly divided party, the bill pitted another two top Republican prospects for the 2016 White House race against each other. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida voted no and Representative Paul Ryan, the 2012 vice-presidential nominee, voted yes. According to Republican sources, Cantor and McCarthy voted against the bill even though they had earlier pressured rank-and-file members to support it, while Ryan - another so-called Republican 'Young Gun' in the House - was expected to join them but changed his mind at the last minute. Ryan later said in a statement: 'Will the American people be better off if this law passes relative to the alternative? 'In the final analysis, the answer is undoubtedly yes. I came to Congress to make tough decisions - not to run away from them.' The influential conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer said on Fox News on Tuesday that it was 'possible' that Cantor's opposition to the bill  'is the prelude to a challenge Thursday', when the new Congress elected last November convenes. Krauthammer said: 'It would be naked to do it at this late hour as a result of the split over this vote. Look, there are a lot of conservatives in the Republican caucus in the House who hate the bill and for good reason. 'This is a complete surrender on everything. The ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts is 40 to 1, rather than one to one or one to two or one to three. So, I mean it's a complete rout by the Democrats.' Via Twitter, Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker and 2012 presidential candidate, stated that Republicans had been engaged in 'a two month dance of defeat and surrender'. Disaster: Boats are seen in a yard, where they washed onto shore during Hurricane Sandy, near Monmouth Beach, New Jersey after the storm lashed the East Coast . Long road to recovery: Robert Connolly, left, embraces his wife Laura as they survey the remains of the home owned by her parents in Breezy Point, New York during Superstorm Sandy. There has been a delay on $60bn relief for those affected . Donald Trump chipped in, also via Twitter: 'I am a Republican... but the Republicans may be the worst negotiators in history!' Multiple accounts of the fiscal cliff negotiations revealed that Boehner appeared to lose his composure on a number of occasions, most notably when he told Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the top Democrat on Capitol Hill, to 'go f*** yourself' during a White House meeting. Christie's broadside against Boehner was also notable because he singled out Cantor as having done his best to bring the Hurricane Sandy bill to a vote. But Cantor's apparent attempts to get the fiscal cliff bill passed make him an unlikely rallying figure against Boehner, at least in the short term. Erick Erickson, a leading conservative figure, used his RedState blog to dismiss the votes of Cantor and McCarthy, saying: 'His was opportunism, not courage.'","Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy voted against fiscall cliff bill that Boehner supported but they will back him in today's vote .

"He was known as the Pennsylvania cat-murderer, a vicious hound sentenced to life imprisonment at Eastern State Penitentiary for the grisly killing of the governor's moggie. In his prison mugshot from 1924, he is seen with ears drooping backwards, an identification number hanging form around his neck looking decisively guilty. According to newspapers stories at the time, Pep the Black Labrador attacked and killed a cat belonging to the wife of Pennsylvania's then governor Gifford Pinchot. Falsely accused: Pep 'The Cat-Murdering Dog' in his prison mugshot after being admitted to Eastern State Penitentiary . Showing absolutely no remorse for his despicable crimes, Pep was sent down for life with no chance of parole. But he was framed. Pep was actually entirely innocent, and his actual offence was nothing more serious than chewing the cushions of the sofa on the governor's front porch. Owner: Pep had been a gift to  Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot . The account of him killing the cat was . entirely fictitious, made up by a newspaper reporter taking a touch more than his fair share . of journalistic licence. The editor loved the story as it was frequently reprinted bearing the mugshot picture. Governor Pinchot's son would later recall how his father was inundated with 'absolutely thousands of letters' about Pep and his prison sentence. Of course the real story is far less exciting. Pep was originally a gift to Pennsylvania Governor  from the nephew of his wife Cornelia Bryce Pinchot. One of her relatives relative was a breeder of Labrador Retrievers. He became a much-loved part of the household at the start of Pinchot's first term as governor which lasted between 1923 and 1927. But in early 1924 he began to develop a bad of chewing on the cushions of the front porch sofa. Pinchot decided that the unruly dog had to go and a trip to a penitentiary in Maine had given him the perfect solution. Pep was sent to Eastern State Penitentiary, but not as a prisoner. On his visit to Maine, Governor Pinochet had seen dogs being used as therapy to help inmates rehabilitation, and thought Pep could be the perfect candidate. So the naughty dog was packed off to prison as a pet where he became a favourite among the inmates. Lock up: Pep became a firm favourite with inmates at Eastern State Penitentiary . In reality Pep was sent to the penitentiary as a pet for the prisoners after he developed a habit of chewing the governor's cushions . In 1929 when the new Graterford prison was constructed about 50 miles away Pep would travel back and fourth with the prison work crew. He eventually died of natural causes and is buried on the prison grounds. The account of how Pep was framed is found in papers of the Governor Pinchot's son at the family home in Milford, Pennsylvania about 130 miles northeast of Philadelphia.",Pep the Black Labrador accused of killing cat belonging to the wife of Pennsylvania governor Gifford Pinchot .

"He has modelled himself as a cool, calculated leader of the free world. But at the age of 22 Barack Obama had a strong 'sexual warmth' that overwhelmed his girlfriend at the time, according to a new book that identifies her for the first time. Vivid diaries written by Genevieve Cook reveal she was driven wild by the smell of sweat, smoking and deodorant that emanated from his bedroom. President Obama's first serious girlfriend, Genevieve Cook, has shared her diaries about their year-long love affair for a new biography and how the then 22-year-old Obama had great sexual warmth . Cook, seen her in college at Swathmore, wrote how Obama loved running and lived in an apartment that smelled of raisins and sweat. The 22-year-old would sit around shirtless in a sarong on weekends and do the Sunday crossword. She was 25 when they dated . She said that on Sundays the future U.S. President loved to lounge around bare chested in a white and blue sarong whilst doing the newspaper crossword . In a controversial claim she also recounted how he was deeply confused about his racial identity and 'felt like an imposter because he was so white'. In the end Mr Obama, who was raised in Hawaii by his white mother, decided that he needed to 'go black' because it was best for him. Ms Cook has long been hailed as the 'mystery woman' from Mr Obama's days in New York that he wrote about in his own memoir. Cook also shared how Obama, here with his grandparents Stanley and Madelyn Dunham while he was at Columbia, struggled with identity. He hung out with Pakistani friends, was raised by a white mother and white grandparents and had spent much of his childhood abroad . This is the first time she has been identified or revealed her extensive diaries from the time she and Mr Obama dated. The disclosure are from a forthcoming book, 'Barack Obama: The Story' by David Maraniss and features in the June edition of Vanity Fair. The journals are excerpted in this upcoming Obama biography by David Maraniss . The extracts reveal Mr Obama and Ms Cook met at a Christmas party in New York's East Village in December 1983 when she was 25, three years older than him. Mr Obama was still in his 'cocoon' phase and figuring himself out whilst working a dull job and living in a modest Manhattan apartment. The two began seeing each other every Thursday night and on weekends and Ms Cook instantly found herself drawn to her 'startling' new friend. In one diary entry she remarks: 'How is he so old already, at the age of 22?' The book reads: 'She remembered how on Sundays Obama would lounge around, drinking coffee and solving the New York Times crossword puzzle, bare-chested, wearing a blue and white sarong. 'His bedroom was closest to the front door, offering a sense of privacy and coziness. 'Genevieve described it in her journal this way: 'I open the door, that Barack keeps closed, to his room, and enter into a warm, private space pervaded by a mixture of smells that so strongly speak of his presence, his liveliness, his habits - running sweat, Brut spray deodorant, smoking, eating raisins, sleeping, breathing.' An entry dated February 9 1984 reads: 'Today, for the first time, Barack sat on the edge of the bed - dressed - blue jeans and luscious ladies on his chest (a comfy T-shirt depicting buxom women) the end of the front section of the Sunday Times in his hand, looking out the window, and the quality of light reflected from his eyes, windows of the soul, heart, and mind, was so clear, so unmasked, his eyes narrower than he usually holds them looking out the window, usually too aware of me.' The two eventually moved in together and spent their days cooking - Mr Obama loved to make a ginger beef meal or tuna sandwiches the way his grandfather had taught him. The read books together, spent hours talking about authors and Mr Obama kept up his passion for jogging that he would keep with him in the White House. In her diary Ms Cook writes: 'The sexual warmth is definitely there - but the rest of it has sharp edges and I'm finding it all unsettling and finding myself wanting to withdraw from it all.. '...his warmth can be deceptive. Though he speaks sweet words and can be open and trusting, there is also that coolness - and I begin to have an inkling of some things about him that could get to me'. Cook writes how overwhelmed her then boyfriend was after he woke from a dream in which his father told his son that he loved him. The dream inspired the title of Obama's memoir . Genevieve was also with him when he had the dream of about his father, for which his first memoir 'Dreams from My Father' was named, in which the already-dead and barely present anyway Obama Sr says, 'Barack, I always wanted to tell you how much I love you.' Genevieve recalls the morning he woke up. 'I remember him being just so overwhelmed, and I so badly wanted to fix him, help him fix that pain. He woke up from that dream and started talking about it. I think he was haunted.' The future President went on to write about Genevieve in the memoir, but did not by name. Their relationship was part of a composite girlfriend he created to protect his previous lovers' privacy. In an interview for the new biography Mr Obama admits that one anecdote he described in 'Dreams' never happened. In 'Dreams' he described seeing a play by a black playwright with his girlfriend. In Maraniss's new biography Obama, seen here on Wednesday returning from Afghanistan, admits fictionalizing a fight about black anger with a white girlfriend in 'Dreams from My Father'. The girlfriend in that memoir was a composite of Cook and several other lovers . After the play was over, my friend started talking about why black people were so angry all the time,' he wrote in part, 'And she said that anger was just a dead end. We had a big fight, right in front of the theater.' 'That was not [Cook],” Obama admitted to Maraniss for the new biography. “That was an example of compression... I thought that [the anecdote involving the reaction of a white girlfriend to the angry black play] was a useful theme to make about sort of the interactions that I had in the relationships with white girlfriends.' But during their relationship Cook and her lover did often talk about race and when they did Mr Obama was quite revealing. The book reads that it was part of his 'inner need to find a sense of belonging' and Ms Cook encouraged it. The book reads: 'If she felt like an outsider, he was a double outsider, racial and cross-cultural. He looked black, but was he? He confessed to her that at times: 'He felt like an imposter. Because he was so white. There was hardly a black bone in his body.' 'At some point that summer she realized that: 'In his own quest to resolve his ambivalence about black and white, it became very, very clear to me that he needed to go black.' Cook wrote at the time that Obam's ideal woman was likely 'a fighter, a laugher, well - experienced - a black woman I keep seeing her as.' He and Michelle will have been married 20 years this fall . Ms Cook, who is white, also writes that she was unable to shake the suspicion that his ideal woman was 'a fighter, a laugher, well-experienced—a black woman I keep seeing her as.' By the autumn of 1984 Ms Cook began teaching at a primary school and Mr Obama had set his sights on Chicago where he would work as a community organiser before going to Harvard Law School. They broke up and in her diary she claims he was too cold and not giving her the level of emotional involvement that she needed . In an entry from May 1985 she writes: 'Now, at this point, I'm left wondering if Barack's reserve, etc. is not just the time in his life, but, after all, emotional scarring that will make it difficult for him to get involved even after he's sorted his life through with age and experience.' Of the breakup she wrote, 'I was not the person that brought infatuation. (That lithe, bubbly, strong black lady is waiting somewhere!)' Mr Obama went on to marry his wife Michelle in 1992 and have two children with her. The couple have been married for almost 20 years.","Then-girlfriend Genevieve Cook wrote in her diary, 'He felt like an imposter. Because he was so white'

"The northern Syrian city of Raqqa is at the centre of an intelligence gathering operation to find Jihadi John. Dubbed the ‘heart of evil’ by Special Forces, it is effectively capital of the self-proclaimed Islamic State. Raqqa, on the north bank of the Euphrates, is the headquarters of IS and base to leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Scroll down for video . The 'heart of evil': IS Stronghold Raqqa in northern Syria has become the focus for Special Forces in their hunt for Jihadi John . It is also where most of the 20 international hostages are being held – probably in a network of underground tunnels. US drones and satellites are focused on the city. Every detail from surveillance images, electronic monitoring and human intelligence from within Raqqa is being poured over. But hostages are said to be moved regularly to different locations around the city and leaders rarely spend more than a couple of days in one building. In the months since IS militants imposed Sharia law, thieves have had their hands hacked off and opponents have been crucified or beheaded. Music has been banned. The northern Syrian city of Raqqa is at the centre of an intelligence gathering operation to find Jihadi John (pictured in a video showing the execution of David Haines, left) Smoking is now forbidden, women must wear the full veil and there have been reports of people being stoned to death. Even goats have had their genitals covered. It is said that if you are on the streets at prayer time, you risk your life. One resident said: ‘They banned the sale of alcohol, they tried to close cafes where boys and girls sit together, they banned street theatre, cinema, bright colours and forced women to wear Islamic dress. 'They are the new dictators, just like Bashar al-Assad, but dressed in black.’ Islamists proudly described Jihadi John as a ‘serial killer’ last night as they gloated at the global wave of revulsion over his atrocities . Islamists proudly described Jihadi John as a ‘serial killer’ last night as they gloated at the global wave of revulsion over his atrocities. One radical boasted that the three beheadings made better viewing than Dexter, the hit US TV series about the secret life of a psychopath. The man, known only as Abu Shiddah, taunted security agencies working around the clock to identify John and track him down. He tweeted: ‘Jihadi John got 3 confirmed kills. Kuffaar [non-believers] still ain’t caught him. 3 kills makes him a serial killer. Forget watching tv Dexter or 24.’ The comments were among a torrent of bile spewed out on social networking sites supporting the latest atrocity by Islamic State. Many fighting in Syria and northern Iraq begged the West to send in ground forces, using the sarcastic line: #bringbackyourtroops. Others focused on Prime Minister David Cameron, saying his decision to return to Downing Street was ‘too little, too late’. Chief among them was notorious firebrand cleric Trevor Brooks, a former acolyte of Omar Bakri Muhammad and Abu Hamza. He tweeted: ‘What’s your next move, Dave?’ alongside a picture of a poppy-wearing Mr Cameron at a remembrance event. Another Twitter user, Mujahid Miski, gloated: ‘#IslamicState sent another1 to hell.’ IS has lavished special privileges on foreign arrivals, giving them free accommodation in homes that local residents have been forced to vacate. Shia mosques and Christian churches have been attacked and destroyed by the Sunni militants. Shops, their shutters emblazoned with the IS logo, are closed five times a day for prayer, and religious police prowl. But remaining activists living in safe houses, whose website bears the slogan ‘Raqqa is being slaughtered silently’, are said to be providing vital intelligence, communicating via encrypted online messages.","Syrian city of Raqqa at centre of intelligence operation to find Jihadi John .

"The FBI and Homeland Security have warned police forces across the country to be on the lookout for terrorist threats as a chilling note was posted online warning that Chicago could be an ISIS target. The federal agencies sent a bulletin on Friday to law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for terrorism. Although no specific threats have been identified, they could not guarantee no future attacks, the federal agencies said. Scroll down for video . A chilling  was posted on Twitter on June 20 purportedly from someone with a connection to extremist group ISIS. It featured a picture of the White House and the Old Republic Building in Chicago . The message, reportedly from ISIS, read: 'We are in your state/We are in your cities/We are in your streets/You are our goals anywhere' According to ABC, the bulletin read: 'Because of the individualized nature of the radicalization process – it is difficult to predict triggers that will contribute to [homegrown violent extremists] attempting acts of violence.' It went on to say that lone operatives would provide police very few opportunities to detect and stop the potential mayhem and destruction they were plotting. Chicago in particular has become a prime target because extremist groups think of it as 'Obama Town', a security expert told CBS. A tweet, posted on June 20, has been discovered, showing pictures of the Old Republic Building in Chicago and the White House with a message reportedly from the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL). It reads: 'We are in your state/We are in your cities/We are in your streets/You are our goals anywhere.' The brutal capabilities of ISIS were revealed on Tuesday after a stomach-churning video released showed the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley at the hands of a hooded militant. At a press briefing on Thursday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the U.S. military's job is to 'get ready' for whatever battle might lie ahead. ISIS is 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen,' Hagel said, appearing alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey. 'They're beyond just a terrorist group,' Hagel said. 'They marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well-funded. ...This is beyond anything we've seen, so we must prepare for everything.' The video, uploaded to jihadi websites on Tuesday, shows American journalist James Foley being decapitated by a ISIS extremist . 'It's a long-term threat,' he conceded under questioning from reporters, adding moments later that 'the president has been very clear on mission creep. And he's made it very clear that he will not allow that.' Gen. Dempsey warned that America's involvement in Iraq will continue for years to come, citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic, religious and tribal groups there. 'The conflict against those groups – most of which are local, some of which are regional, and some of which are global in nature – that's going to be a very long contest,' he said. 'It's ideological. It's not political. It's religious in many cases. So, yes, it's going to be a very long contest.' A U.S. senator also said on Thursday that ISIS, the militant terror group sweeping across Iraq, aims to destroy an American city and is working on a plan to do it. 'They're crazy out there and they're rapidly developing a method of blowing up a major U.S. city and people just can't believe that's happening,' Republican Senator Jim Inhofe told the Fox-25 television in Oklahoma City. Inhofe, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned that leaders of ISIS 'are really bad terrorists. They're so bad even al-Qaeda is afraid of them'. Representative Jim Bridenstine, a fellow Oklahoma Republican and a committee member, told the Tulsa World that ISIS Islamists are 'cutting children's bodies in half. They're shooting them. I've never seen anything like it.' A frustrated Inhofe also said on Thursday night that he feared President Obama isn't up to the task, despite the tough words he delivered on Wednesday before hitting the golf course. 'Obama's lofty rhetoric is undermined by fainthearted follow-through and lack of meaningful action,' he told the World. 'The president's limited strikes in Iraq have not halted ISIS' momentum but only temporarily redirected it,' said Inhofe. 'Without sustained pressure, ISIS will regroup and continue its campaign of terror.' 'We're in the most dangerous position we've ever been in as a nation,'he told Fox-25. The president told a global audience this week from his Martha's Vineyard vacation spot that the U.S. 'will continue to do what we must do to protect our people.' 'We will be vigilant and we will be relentless. When people harm Americans, anywhere, we do what's necessary to see that justice is done.' 'We act against ISIL, standing alongside others,' Obama added, hinting at his 'coalition' strategy rather than a plan to strike unilaterally with overwhelming American force. Inhofe, though, warned that without a concrete plan, Obama's words ring hollow. 'Relentless': Obama drew fire this week for golfing as an angry nation mourned the death of journalist James Foley at the hands of an ISIS militant . 'You have to come up with something that we're going to do,' the senator said, 'because they're holding another hostage in place.' 'And the problem is, the president, quite frankly – he says all these things and he never does them.' With the right strategy, he added, the U.S. could defeat ISIS on its home turf before the threat arrives on America's doorstep. 'This idea that they're coming and infiltrating the United States – sure, some are coming in who have had an association with ISIS. But the majority of them are still over there,' he said. The senator also defended the United States government's sweeping intelligence programs that have drawn barbs from civil libertarians, suggesting that information dragnets would play a part in keeping ISIS at bay. 'You have to have an intelligence process going on to stop attacks on America,' he said.","A tweet, posted on June 20, showed pictures of the Old Republic Building in Chicago and the White House .

"Roy Keane was the centre of police investigation in Ireland after an incident involving a member of the public at the Republic of Ireland's team hotel. Keane, who is the Republic of Ireland's assistant manager, was involved in the incident at the Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links in Dublin, yesterday afternoon. The Football Association of Ireland stressed last night, that reports that Keane had been involved in a bust-up at the Republic of Ireland's Dublin base were 'inaccurate'. Roy Keane, pictured arriving for a training session today, is the centre of police investigation in Ireland after an incident involving a member of the public at the Republic of Ireland's team hotel . Keane called police following an incident outside the team's hotel in Portmarknock yesterday . An Irish police spokesman confirmed last night that an investigation had been launched into the incident. ‘Gardai are investigating an incident where officers were called to a location outside a hotel in Portmarknock. No criminal complaint has been made and investigations are ongoing. Medical assistance was rendered.’ Police confirmed today that no complaints have been made from any party involved in the alleged incident at Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links, close to the squad's training ground at Malahide. The Football Association of Ireland confirmed that Keane called the police following the incident outside the Republic of Ireland's team hotel. The Football Association of Ireland stressed last night, that reports that Keane had been involved in a bust-up at the Republic of Ireland's Dublin base were 'inaccurate' The Republic of Ireland are currently preparing for their crunch European Championships qualifier against Scotland on Friday night in Celtic Park, Glasgow . The statement said: 'Following inaccurate media reports which refer to an incident involving a member of the public this evening at the Republic of Ireland team hotel, we wish to clarify that Roy Keane called the Gardai following the incident. 'The manager, Martin O'Neill and the FAI are fully aware of the circumstances surrounding this event, and the Assistant Manager has their full support.' The Republic of Ireland are currently preparing for their crunch European Championships qualifier against Scotland on Friday night in Celtic Park, Glasgow. O'Neill has also moved to scotch claims of disruption within his ranks over an alleged row involving Roy Keane and a fan at the team hotel. In a statement to camera this morning, distributed by the FAI, the Irish boss said he was aware of the facts of the incident and remains fully supportive of his right-hand man. 'The FAI and I have been fully briefed about the circumstances about what happened at the team hotel last night,' said O'Neill. The Football Association of Ireland said Keane had the 'full support' of manager Martin O'Neill (right) 'Roy asked that the Gardai be called and he has notified them of what happened. 'While this process is ongoing we are unable to say more at this point. However I can say that, having been made aware of the facts, that Roy has both my full support and the full support of the FAI and (FAI chief executive) John Delaney.' Hours before the team travel to Glasgow ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier tie with Scotland, O'Neill added: 'We are now focused, as we have been all week, on the game in hand and we won't be saying anything more about this issue.' The Irish soccer legend is no stranger to controversy, but this is certainly his most serious incident since taking the assistant manager’s role for the Irish soccer team. As a player, Keane injured himself trying to tackle Alf-Inge Haaland in a game against Leeds in 1997. Haaland initally accused him of feigning injury. Four years later, Haaland claimed Keane effectively ended his career, after a reckless tackle during a Premier League soccer match in 2001. Keane also famously scrapped with his Manchester United compatriot, Peter Schmeichel. The Danish goalkeeper was significantly bigger than Keane but that did not stop the Irishman leaving his colleague with a black eye after head-butting him during a clash on tour. Keane later revealed: ‘I had a bust-up with Peter when we were on a pre-season tour of Asia. There was drink involved. Keane leads the training session in the rain at Gannon Park, Malahide this morning . The Irish soccer legend is no stranger to controversy, but this is certainly his most serious incident since taking the assistant manager’s role for the Irish soccer team . ‘The manager had a go at us as we were getting on the bus, and people were going on about a fight in the hotel the night before. It started coming back to me - the fight between me and Peter.’ Keane was again the subject of a major controversy when after arriving in Asia for the 2002 World Cup, he voiced his disapproval of the team’s poor training facilities at the Irish camp in Saipan. In front of the entire Irish side, during a routine team meeting, he berated Mick McCarthy, then manager of the Irish side. He was later sent home and played no part in the rest of Ireland’s World Cup campaign. Roy Keane was also involved in an infamous tunnel spat in 2005. Keane became irate after he saw Patrick Viera allegedly ‘bullying’ one of Keane’ s teammates and an altercation ensued. The Football Association of Ireland offered Keane their full support after the alleged incident involving a member of the public at the Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links in Dublin yesterday afternoon, pictured . The soccer hero also has a tetchy relationship with his former manager at Manchester United, Alex Ferguson. During their 12 years together at United, eight of which Keane spent as captain, the pair helped bring seven English Premier League titles, one Champions League trophy and four FA Cups to Old Trafford. But the relationship deteriorated after Keane launched a scathing attack on some of his team-mates during an interview with United’s in-house television channel, MUTV, which was never broadcast, in November 2005. Since then both Ferguson and Keane have criticised one another in their respective autobiographies. The former Irish international published ‘The Second Half’ this year. Keane said in his second autobiography, ‘The self-destruct button is definitely there. And I suffer for it.. ‘I think it was my way of switching off, never mind the consequences. It was my time. It was self-destructive, I can see that, but I’m still drawn to it. Not the drink – but the madness, the irresponsibility.’","Roy Keane called police after incident inside Irish team hotel in Dublin .

"A nurse was murdered and mutilated by her ex-boyfriend after police failed to warn her that he had a history of attacks on women, a damning official report has found. Katie Cullen, 34, a highly respected hospital sister, was ‘badly let down’ by police who failed to protect her from Iman Ghaefelipour, 28. The Iranian, who had successfully claimed asylum in the UK, threatened to kill two previous girlfriends and burn down one of their houses. Scandal: Katie Cullen, 34, was stabbed 130 times in the head by Iranian-born asylum-seeker Iman Saeed Ghaefelipour, 28, but was never warned he had threatened to kill a previous ex-girlfriend . When Miss Cullen reported him to police for harassment and death threats, they investigated – but did not pass on the information. This was because she said he had spoken ‘in the heat of the moment’ and had never been violent, and there were no ‘warning markers’ for violence on his record, they claimed. Miss Cullen later agreed to meet him at her home, where he stabbed her more than 130 times in the face and neck, cut out her right eyeball and tried to sever her right hand. He was jailed for at least 23 years in 2010 after pleading guilty to the murder in October 2009. Yesterday a deeply critical report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found that had she been told of his past, Miss Cullen might be alive today. It said claims he set fires on an earlier partner’s property were not handled properly. Rachel Cerfontyne, IPCC deputy chairman, said police put her in danger by giving her ‘false reassurance’. She went on: ‘In my view, Katie was badly let down by Greater Manchester Police. Our investigation exposed a catalogue of inaction and missed opportunities. ‘Had arson offences against [his ex] been adequately investigated, it is possible Mr Ghaefelipour would have been convicted and not at liberty . . . [Miss Cullen] was passed from pillar to post.’ Her mother Diane, also a nurse, said: ‘We are distraught at what happened to Katie and utterly appalled at the lack of care she received at the hands of GMP. ‘It is inconceivable to us that the two police officers concerned should protect her assailant . . . rather than a vulnerable girl who lived on her own and who turned to them for help. By withholding such information from Katie they denied her the opportunity to protect herself. ‘She returned to her own home alone and vulnerable, ignorant of the dangerous situation she was in.’ She added: ‘Since Katie’s murder we have been plunged into unimaginable torture. ‘There isn’t a day goes by I don’t think about her.’ 2002: Killer Iman Ghaefelipour arrives in UK and claims asylum. 2007: Has relationship with woman but in August of that year after she broke it off, her car and front door was set alight. She called police but they failed to check out his alibi or CCTV so is freed without charged. If he had been convicted he would have been deported. 2008: Katie Cullen meets her killer at a Salsa class in March and embarks on relationship with him. Six months later she broke it off because he took £3,000 from her bank account without permission. May 2009: She started a new relationship but bumped into Ghaefelipour in a restaurant, where he threatened to kill her and her boyfriend and then made menacing phone calls. Miss Cullen went to police twice, she was subjected to 26 different procedural delays, before she was seen by two police officers.Their system showed no warning markers against his name - but a search after her death found them. October 2009:  Ghaefelipour arrives at her house and says he has the £3,000 he owed her. He then tortured and murdered her. Ghaefelipour, of Urmston, Greater Manchester, claimed asylum in the UK in 2002 and was granted indefinite leave to remain. Miss Cullen, a senior sister in cardiology at the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, started dating him in 2008 after they met at salsa-dancing classes. The six-month affair ended when she discovered that her jobless boyfriend had stolen more than £3,000 from her account. She went to police but did not press charges after he vowed to pay it back. In June 2009 Miss Cullen began another relationship. When Ghaefelipour learned this, he attacked her in a jealous rage. She reported it to police, but officers did not tell her about his past. In October that year, he went to her home in Stockport, Cheshire, on the pretext of discussing his debt. There, he fell into a violent rage and murdered her. Bereft: Patrick Cullen, brother of murdered nurse Katie Cullen reads a statement outside Manchester Crown Court, with his mother Diane, left, sister Alison and father Peter, after the damning report . The IPCC found that two constables and a sergeant had failed the nurse by poor and unsatisfactory performance. Greater Manchester Police is one of four forces identified by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary as giving cause for serious concern over its response to domestic abuse. Detective Chief Superintendent Paul Rumney, of GMP, said it accepted that it did not investigate the arson claims with enough ‘rigour’ and that officers in touch with Miss Cullen lacked ‘experience’. He added: ‘Had more been done to better understand the risk Ghaefelipour posed, GMP may have been able to assist Katherine to make more informed life choices.’ Polly Neate, of the charity Women’s Aid, said that many abusers continue their pattern of behaviour despite being reported to police. She added: ‘Repeatedly we see cases where women are killed because of poor police responses. We urge every police force to ensure that each officer has regular, specialist-led domestic violence training.’ Last year, a scheme was introduced in parts of England and Wales to allow people to check whether their partner had a violent past. Clare’s Law was brought in after Clare Wood was killed by her ex boyfriend George Appleton. A scheme giving people the 'right to know' if a partner has a history of domestic violence was rolled out to police forces across England and Wales in March. Clare's Law was created after 36-year-old Clare Wood, right, was murdered by a man who became known as the 'Facebook fugitive'. In the days after her brutal killing, detectives issued a warning that her ex-boyfriend George Appleton might attempt to communicate with other women via the internet. Unbeknown to Miss Wood, Appleton had a history of violence towards women and was known to prowl online dating websites and Facebook in search of partners, often using different aliases. The mother-of-one's body was discovered in the bedroom of her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in February 2009. She had been strangled and set on fire. Police watchdogs concluded afterwards that she had been badly let down by 'individual and systemic' failures by Greater Manchester Police (GMP). In the months before her murder she had repeatedly contacted GMP alleging Appleton had caused criminal damage, harassed her, threatened to kill her and tried to rape her. Appleton, from Salford, was found six days later after her death, hanged in a derelict pub. Clare's father, Michael Wood, who has backed the campaign, later said he had taken an 'instant' dislike to Appleton. Miss Wood had told her father Appleton had a criminal record - though only for motoring offences. In fact he had been jailed for three years in 2002 for harassing another woman and for six months a year earlier after breaching a restraining order on another ex-girlfriend. Her father, a former prison officer from Batley, West Yorkshire, said at the hearing: 'My daughter wasn't stupid. Had she known about George Appleton's past she would have taken herself and my granddaughter out of there in a heartbeat.'","Katie Cullen, 34, stabbed 130 times in head by Iman Ghaefelipour in 2009 .

"The identities of three of the good Samaritans who saved a driver's life by pulling him out of his blazing car after it crashed and burst into flames in Virginia have been revealed. Two of the men, James Shea and Tyrone Carmen, were driving along the Powhite Parkway in Chesterfield County shortly before 3am on Sunday when they spotted the fire and pulled over. After realizing it was a burning car lying on its side, they desperately tried to kick in the vehicle's sunroof to rescue the stricken male driver, but it failed to give way. However, seconds later, the third man, Aaron Parks, from Chesterfield, arrived at the scene carrying a hammer, broke the glass and dragged the victim out of the car. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"A ‘cheeky’ 12-year-old died after accidentally hanging himself off his bunk bed while ‘mucking about’, a coroner has ruled. Kyle Darker, from Eccles, Salford, was found dead in his room by his mother Lorraine while he was temporarily excluded from school. Police who investigated the death could find no evidence that Kyle had been bullied or faced significant difficulties at St Patrick’s RC School in Eccles. Tragic: Kyle Darker accidentally hanged himself from his bunk bed after he was told to tidy his room . Bolton Coroners’ Court heard how Kyle was a ‘mischievous, interesting boy, liked by his friends and who amused his friends’. Deputy headteacher Rachel Well revealed how Kyle had been suspended after a classroom prank. Although Ms Well said Kyle’s behaviour could be ‘disruptive’, she described him as ‘full of life, a really bright young man’. She said: 'He was full of fun and sometimes that fun got him into a bit of trouble.' Mucking about: Kyle was rushed to Salford Royal A&E where doctors could not resuscitate him . The inquest heard how on April 1,  mother Lorraine asked Kyle to clean his room before she went out. The last thing Kyle said to her when she asked him if he wanted to come to the shop was: 'No, but get me some crisps.' When Lorraine, a student, arrived home she found Kyle hanging off his bed with a bag he used to keep his glasses and phone in overnight. 'He was prone to pranks, he was prone to surprises. I believe that on this occasion it was a situation of mucking about' Coroner Alan Walsh . He was rushed to Salford Royal A&E where doctors could not resuscitate him. Although the bag’s thin cord had become wrapped around Kyle’s neck, doctors found no deep marks or signs of trauma on the youngster’s body. Pathologist Dr Gordon Armstrong said Kyle, who was described as small for his age, died after his airways became trapped, but marks found on his body were consistent with an active ‘12-year-old who played with scooters’. A police investigation later ruled out any bullying rumours at the school. The inquest heard how Kyle was prone to playing pranks and had previously climbed through a window and onto a roof. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Alan Walsh said there was enough evidence to suggest a tragic mishap by Kyle. He said: 'He was prone to pranks, he was . prone to surprises. I believe that on this occasion it was a situation . of mucking about.' Kyle Darker (right) was found dead in his room at his family home in Eccles, Salford (left) In a statement read out in court, mother Lorraine said: 'Unless you lose a child in these circumstances, no one can understand the pain.' It added: 'My beautiful baby, I can hardly breathe without you here, we miss you every second. 'Kyle, you don’t know the gap that you have left in my life. You were the sweetest kid and everyone loves you so much. 'We don’t know how we will carry on without you. We love you beyond words, why oh why? 'My poor baby, sweet dreams. You have a big family to look after you in heaven so you won’t be alone. Our hearts are completely broken without you.'","Kyle Darker, from Salford, found dead in his room by mother Lorraine .

"A loving wife died of a 'broken heart' just days after her husband of 62 years passed away. Nora Spencer, 83, died just days after her husband of more than six decades Edward Spencer lost his battled with cancer, aged 86. The loving pair, who lived together at Amherst House Care Home in Horley, Surrey, raised seven children during their remarkable marriage - and have 32 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Nora and Edward Spencer pictured not long after they married in the early 50s. The two met during Mr Spencer's National Service when he was stationed in Kent at the Chatham Naval Docks in the 1950s . In a public tribute written on behalf of the family after her death, son Stephen said: 'Painless peace, rest was called, sadly missed and loved by all - night night, God bless.' Edward Spencer met his future wife Nora during his National Service in the early 1950s - and only spent 17 days away from her in 62 years of marriage. Originally from Leeds, Mr Spencer was stationed at the Chatham Naval Docks in Kent, where he met his future wife - who he lovingly called his 'Chatham Cutie.' Within a matter of weeks, the couple married and they moved together to Crawley, West Sussex. The pair raised seven children at the same family home, before moving to nearby Southgate. As their health began failing with age, the lifelong companions moved together to the same care home, in order to not be apart. Mr Spencer lost his battle against cancer on October 13, and his heartbroken widow, who suffered from Alzheimer's and dementia, passed away just 17 days later. The couple pictured at their former home in Southgate, where they saw out their final years together . Their son Stephen thanked the carers who made his parents' last days as comfortable as possible. He said: 'The family would like to express their fondest gratitude to Arthur Tanare and his dedicated staff at Amherst House, Horley. 'They excelled in not only their care, but their awareness and vigilance regarding Nora's Alzheimer's and dementia whilst supporting the family during such difficult times. 'Also special thanks to staff at Walstead Court, Southgate, for providing 24-hour care for the past three years and St Catherine's Hospice for their specialist support and care in making Edward comfortable during the final stages of his battle with cancer.'","Nora Spencer died days after her husband Edward lost battle with cancer .

"A drunk Qantas passenger on a Sydney-bound flight was so desperate for another drink that he busted free from four sets of handcuffs after being restrained by two undercover federal police. The man's unruly behaviour on the flight from Bangkok caused it to make an unscheduled landing at Cairns in Queensland. It is believed the passenger, 34, was trying to pilfer whisky from a service area on QF24. A drunk man believed to be in his 20s was arrested on a Qantas flight and broke out of handcuffs four times . He reportedly shouted intermittently for hours and yelled 'turn off the f***ing light c***', according to Fairfax Media. The flight landed an hour and half later than expected at 9.10am on Sunday. A statement from Qantas confirmed the incident and said a diversion was caused by 'an intoxicated passenger'. 'Australian Federal Police met the aircraft on arrival into Cairns and escorted the passenger off the aircraft,' the statement said. 'Qantas has a zero tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour on our aircraft. 'The aircraft has since landed in Sydney.' A Qantas spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia it would be inappropriate to comment further on the matter as it was now with the police. The man has been charged with behaving in an offensive and disorderly manner on an aircraft and will appear on Monday in Cairns Magistrates Court. '[Officers] boarded the plane when it landed at Cairns Airport and removed the passenger without incident,' an AFP spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. It comes almost two months after a pair of drunk women - believed to be in their 20s - forced two Canadian fighter jets to escort a Cuban-bound flight back to Toronto after they made threats against Sunwing Flight 656. The two passengers downed a large amount of duty-free alcohol in the toilet before setting off the smoke alarms by lighting a cigarette and then got into a fight. They ended up making threats against the plane, which were 'considered non-credible given their condition'.","The man was on a flight from Bangkok to Sydney on Sunday morning .

"A film dramatizing the death of Osama bin Laden is set to debut next month two days before the U.S. presidential election. The movie produced by the production company of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein will air on November 4 before President Barack Obama faces Republican challenger Mitt Romney at the polls just two days later. Weinstein is a prominent fundraiser for Obama’s re-election campaign, which has touted bin Laden’s death as an example of the president’s leadership. Scroll down for video . Before polls: The film dramatizing Osama bin Laden's death will air two days before President Obama faces Republican challenger Mitt Romney at the polls (pictured together at the presidential debate on Wednesday) The timing of the film's broadcast prompted suggestions that it was deliberately intended to show the president in a good light two days before the polls. Seal Team Six: The Raid On Osama bin Laden from The Weinstein Co. and Voltage Pictures will air on the National Geographic Channel. National Geographic Channel chose the film's debut date to help promote the start of its fall season, channel President Howard T. Owens said yesterday. He insisted the timing was not motivated by politics, adding: ‘Harvey obviously doesn't schedule our network. Dramatizing terrorist's death: Movie mogul and Obama supporter Harvey Weinstein (left) has produced the movie about the death of Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden (right) who was killed in a raid on his compound in Pakistan in 2011 . Leading moment: Bin Laden's death has been touted as a strong show of Obama's leadership (pictured with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and national security staff as they receive an update on the mission in 2011) Mr Owens added that the channel is ‘not political. We are opportunistic from a programming perspective.’ National Geographic Channel also took into account Weinstein's desire to get out ahead of a movie about the U.S. Navy SEALs' hunt for the al-Qaida leader to be released in theatres at the end of the year, Mr Owens said. The competition comes from film 'Zero Dark Thirty' from director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, who won six Oscars for the acclaimed 'The Hurt Locker' which follows a team of army bomb disposal experts in Iraq as they battle to carry out their jobs in extremely testing circumstances. Remnants of raid: The foundations of bin Laden's compound were left destroyed after the raid by U.S. commandoes in Abbottabad, Pakistan . Carnage: A U.S. military helicopter was destroyed in the raid (the wreckage pictured outside bin Laden's compound) 'Seal Team Six,' directed by John .

"Now here's an anniversary to make you feel old. Pong is 40 this week. The classic video game, one of the first to reach mainstream popularity, was officially released on November 29, 1972 - 40 years ago this Thursday. The two-dimensional table tennis simulator, the first release by Atari, is credited with being one of the progenitors of the video games industry, which is now worth a phenomenal $65billion a year. Scroll down for demo . Simple, but addictive: Pong, the first release by Atari, is credited with being one of the progenitors of the video games industry, which is now worth a phenomenal $65billion a year . The simple two-dimensional simulation of ping pong, consists merely of two paddles which moved up and down to pass a moving spot between each player. Yet its addictive gameplay captured the imagination of thousands of players around the world, building Atari's status as an early video games giant. The game was designed by Allan Alcorn, an expert in electrical engineering and computer science, who was handed the project as a training exercise by Atari co-founders Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. It was not the first commercial coin-operated video game - that accolade belongs to Computer Space, which Dabney and Bushnell helped to develop for Nutting Associates. But it was the first to really take off with the paying public, spawning a host of imitators and, indeed, a lawsuit from the makers of the first home computer games console who claimed it was a rip-off of their product. Despite that, it formed the basis of Atari's first home video games console and, following a settlement, the company went on to become, for a time, the world leader. The high tech of the old days: Liverpool FC and England footballer Steve Heighway and a woman playing the computer tennis game Pong on the Videomaster games console . Atari's Home Pong console, released through Sears in 1975: A far cry from today's all singing, all dancing motion sensitive video games entertainment systems . Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left side of the screen, and can compete against either a computer controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth, with the aim being for one  to earn more points than opponents by forcing fail to to return the ball to the other. Pong was the first game developed by Atari after its incorporation in June 1972 by Bushnell and Dabney, who were fresh from producing Computer Space. The pair asked Alcorn, an expert in electrical engineering and computer science who had no computer games experience, to develop the game as an exercise to familiarise him with game production. Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked him to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping. The way we played: A little boy plays a video game of noughts and crosses in a picture dated to 1975 . Youngsters play on a Sega Mega Drive: The video games industry has come on in leaps and bounds since its early beginnings . Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell has said he doesn't get Nintendo's latest tablet-controlled console the Wii U and told of his doubts about its long term success. 'I am baffled by it,' he says in an interview with the New York Times. 'I don't think it's going to be a big success.' He told the paper that Nintendo's latest machine could mark the end of an era in which consoles are the dominant force in gaming. 'These things will continue to sputter along, but I really don’t think they’ll be of major import ever again,' he said, adding that consoles are being made obsolete by mobile games. Nintendo has admitted it is losing money on every Wii U sold, but claims that the sale of just one game per machine would put them back in the black. Alcorn built the first prototype from a $75 Hitachi black and white television set bought from a local shop and placed in a 4ft wooden cabinet, with wires soldered into boards to create the necessary circuitry. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal, according to Wikipedia. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the centre segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the more it was returned back and forth between paddles; missing the ball reset the speed. Despite its simplicity, the game impressed Bushnell and Dabney so much that they felt it could be profitable and they installed a prototype in a local bar for market testing, where it was a success. Despite interests from gaming companies including Midway, which would later go on to fame with the Mortal Kombat series, Atari decided to build the product themselves and by 1973 were shipping Pong cabinets worldwide. Experts consider Pong the game that launched the video game industry, with the release of its home version in 1974 the successful beginning of home video game consoles.","Classic video game was the first release by Atari in 1972 .

"R.K. Gupta (pictured) is accused of having carried out 83 tubectomies in just three hours at a state-run 'family planning camp' Pictures have emerged of the Indian doctor believed to be responsible for the mass-sterilisation which left 13 women dead and dozens hospitalised. R.K. Gupta is accused of having carried out  83 tubectomies in just three hours at a state-run 'family planning camp' in the Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh state on Saturday. A majority of the women fell ill shortly afterwards, and local government officials admit the equipment used was rusty and medicines provided to the women were contaminated. 'Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery,' said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district where the camp was held. The death toll has now reached 13, dozens  remain in hospital and 20 are critically ill. The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear, but officials said the victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly because of dirty surgical equipment or contaminated medicines. Dr Gupta's mass sterilisation took less than three hours with the help of two assistants working in a dirty, abandoned private hospital, officials said, and contravened government guidelines to limit such operations to 30 a day. 'Preliminary reports show that the medicines administered were spurious and also the equipment used was rusted,' senior local government official Siddharth Komal Singh Pardeshi said. A seven-member team of doctors from New Delhi arrived in the district of Bilaspur on Wednesday to investigate what went wrong, and the local government registered with the police a case of causing death by negligence against Gupta. Local media said Gupta blamed medicine the women had been later given and denied making any mistakes. The 83 women who underwent tubectomies at the camp received . incentive payments of 1,400 rupees ($23) to have the surgery, . according to R.K. Bhange, Bilaspur's chief medical officer. Health workers also got 200 ($3.25) rupees for bringing a woman . to the camp. The cause of the deaths of the eight women had not been . determined, according to Bhange, but he said they had been . vomiting before they died.

Tragedy: 13 women have died and dozens remain in hospital after a state-run mass sterilisation in India, which was carried out with rusty instruments and contaminated medicines .

Government mass sterilization camps are held regularly in Chhattisgarh and other states as part of a long-running effort to control India's booming population . An Indian woman who underwent sterilisation surgery is carried on a stretcher for treatment at the CIMS hospital in Bilaspur, in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh . Tubectomies were carried out on 83 women by a single doctor in a government-run 'family planning camp' 'As of now, the government has not found any evidence of . negligence,' said Bhange. He said the government doctors who had . performed the surgeries were experienced in the procedure. Deaths due to sterilization are not a new problem in India, . where more than four million sterilizations were performed in . 2013-14, according to the government. Between 2009 and 2012, the government paid compensation for . 568 deaths resulting from sterilization, the health ministry . said in an answer to a question in parliament two years ago. Authorities in eastern India came under fire last year after a news channel unearthed footage showing scores of women dumped unconscious in a field following a mass sterilisation. The women had all undergone surgical procedures at a hospital that local officials said was not equipped to accommodate such a large number of patients. Health advocates worry that paying women to undergo . sterilization at family planning camps is both dangerous and, by . default, limits their contraceptive choices. 'The payment is a form of coercion, especially when you are . dealing with marginalized communities,' said Kerry McBroom, . director of the Reproductive Rights Initiative at the Human .

'I was crushed that she would do that,' a trembling and sobbing Raymond Rivera said, following a brief court appearance in Uxbridge District Court Wednesday. 'I never saw the infant at all.' Rivera, who was the father of at least two of the surviving children removed from the house in Blackstone, has not been charged with neglecting the children or in connection with the infant remains. Broken man: Raymond River, 37, the boyfriend of Massachusetts 'house of horrors' mother Erika Murray, told reporters Wednesday that he knew nothing about her pregnancies, or the shocking living conditions inside the house . Kept in the dark: A shaken Mr Rivera (left) claimed that he always stayed in the basement because his girlfriend (right) banned him from going upstairs . House of death: Three of Murray's children were found dead inside the Blackstone home in September . Legal trouble: Rivera, pictured here in court Wednesday, has not been charged in the infants' deaths, but he faces three counts of possession of marijuana . Instead, he faces three charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Rivera, 37, did not have a lawyer Wednesday and said he will have to use his retirement money to help pay for one since he quit his job at an office supply store and is living out of his car. 'I'm crumbling. I'm crumbling,' said Rivera, who is also referred to as Ramon Rivera III in some public documents, as he walked away from reporters after a highly emotional interview. Erika Murray, 31, the children's mother, has pleaded not guilty to fetal death concealment, permitting substantial injury to a child, and child endangerment. She is due in court in January. The woman’s attorney, Keith Halpern, said last month that she appears to have mental health issues. The lawyer said the woman told him the dead infants were born starting about eight years ago and at least one was born alive and lived a few days before she found the child dead in a bassinet. Rivera, who is expected back in court December 17, said Murray worked hard to keep him in the dark about the shocking living conditions upstairs. Rivera claimed he had no idea that his children were living in deplorable conditions inside the house crawling with vermin . Bio-hazard: Cleanup crews in full hazmat suits and respirators spent several days in September removed piles of garbage from the Blackstone home . No place to raise a child: Mounds of refuse mixed in with old furniture, discarded electronic equipment, empty soda cans and food wrappings were found inside the family home . Shocking clutter: Graphic photos have been released of a house of horrors in Blackstone where three dead babies were discovered . He maintained that Murray told him to 'go in the basement' and 'stay in the basement' and never talked about her pregnancies. 'Nobody outside knows what went on in that house,' Rivera said. Boston Globe quoted him as saying: 'Ninety nine per cent of my awake time was in the basement.'. The state Department of Children and Families took custody of four children ranging in age from 5-months old to 13-years-old from the Blackstone home in August. The two youngest survivors were found covered in their own feces, malnourished and severely neglected. They did not appear to have ever been taken outside the house. The remains of the three babies, two of them almost entirely skeletal, were found in the home in September. The dead infants were reportedly dressed in diapers and onesies, and stuffed inside bags hanging in upstairs closets. The house, which is owned by Rivera's sister, was vermin-infested, with rooms filled with trash, feces smeared on walls, soiled diapers and the remains of several animals.  It has since been condemned and demolished. Razed to the ground: The residence was demolished in October after having been condemned by the town . It took clean-up crews 90 hours spread over four days of work to clear out Murray's house before heavy machinery was brought in to raze it to the ground. The clean-up and demolition cost the City of Blacktone just under $30,000. Murray's four surviving kids were rescued August 28 after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's home asking for help to quieten the crying baby. The neighbor found the youngest child covered in his own feces. Neither the baby nor Murray's three-year-old child have birth records and both are severely malnourished. authorities said .","Raymond Rivera, 37, said he was unaware of the 'inhuman' conditions his children were living in .

"Determined Kurdish forces have been  striking back against advancing ISIS militants  in a besieged town on the Syrian-Turkish border. In a dramatic firefight taking place this evening, the forces could be seen advancing onto the ridgeline occupied by ISIS extremists near the Kurdish town of Kobani. Dozens of Kurdish spectators gathered just metres away to cheer on the fighters in a chorus of deafening shouts and applause, as red flares from tracer bullets propelled across the darkening sky. Footage of the live firefight was filmed from the Turkish side of the embattled border, which has been under attack from ISIS extremists for the past ten days. Scroll down for video . Dozens of spectators cheered on the fighters in a chorus of deafening shouts and applause, as bouts of fire were seen shooting across the blackened sky in a live firefight filmed by CNN on the Turkish-Syrian border between ISIS militants and Kurdish forces . A reporter for CNN, which aired the live fight, said this evening's battle had caused a blow to ISIS militants, with injuries reported and several casualties seen being carried away from the bloody scene. ISIS has been making progress in the area for more than a week, advancing a few miles each day and forcing a human tide of Syrians - many of them ethnic Kurds - to flee to Turkey. Today, a baby's cot was among the items left abandoned by fleeing Syrians, as women, children and the elderly escaped their homes amid heavy fighting between ISIS fighters and Kurdish forces. The ongoing clashes around the town - also known as Ayn Arab - have already sent more than 150,000 refugees into the Turkish province of Sanliurfa - the largest single outflow of refugees since Syria's conflict began more than three years ago. Today, Turkish Kurds gathered about 100metres from Turkish ground to see the fighting between ISIS and Kurdish forces in the next village on the Syrian side . The crowd watched as ISIS fighters attempted to advance with heavy weaponry on the strategic Kurdish border town of Kobani, which they have surrounded on three sides .

A Syrian refugee woman carries a child as she crosses into Turkey. In recent days, Turkey has seen the 'biggest influx' of Syrian refugees - many of them ethnic Kurds - since the start of the war three years ago . Hundreds of children, such as these two young girls pictured left and right, were seen waiting at the border, as their families tried to reach safety . A spokeswoman for the UN agency for refugees (UNHCR) said Turkey had now seen the biggest influx of refugees in the past three years, since ISIS descended on the embattled area . The Turkish government figure includes about 140,000 people who fled Kurdish villages in northern Syria to escape the ongoing attack by ISIS militants . ISIS fighters launched the offensive against Syrian Kurds last week, forcing inhabitants to flee across the border . Islamic State has maintained its grip on territory on three sides of the strategic town, with sporadic clashes continuing today amid the firing of heavy weapons fire heard . The start of attacks in the area appeared to spark a state of panic within the Kurdish community and Turkish soldiers were deployed to stem the relentless flow into their country . A spokesman for the UN agency for refugees (UNHCR) said the number of refugees had dramatically increased since ISIS engulfed the town on three sides and said it represented the largest exodus of refugees from the war-torn country in the past three years. The latest fighting comes after U.S.-led coalition warplanes struck the border town for the first time, sparking a retaliation of shelling from the jihadi fighters. The U.S. Central Command said the air strikes, carried out earlier today, destroyed an ISIS building and two armed vehicles. Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria's Kurdish Democratic Union Party, or PYD, said the jihadi fighters later shelled the town, wounding a number of civilians. One of the mortars blew a large hole in an empty minibus parked near Tavsanli, a nearby village. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the coalition's strikes came amid heavy fighting between ISIS and members of the Kurdish force, known as the People's Protection Units, or YPK. Dozens of people wounded in the fighting arrived in Turkey for treatment on Saturday, it said. Women and children alike were seen carrying their belongings across the border, joining the mass exodus of Syrian refugees who have already fled to Turkey . The refugees were seen sitting in a truck after crossing the border near the southeastern town of Suruc in Sanliurfa province, Turkey .

Most of those seen moving across into Turkey were women and children. Many stopped to rest one they had crossed into safety . Many are forced to wait once they arrived in Turkey, unsure where they are next to go . This baby's cot was left abandoned by fleeing Syrians near the virtually-deserted area near to the border . Authorities in the border province of Sanliurfa have now blocked the main road to the Syrian border as security worsens in the area. Meanwhile, Turkish Kurds living in the region were seen gathered about 100metres from the Turkish ground watching the fighting between the two sides. Hundreds of Kurds broke yesterday through the Turkish border into Syrian territory to join Kurdish forces - known as the Protection of the Kurdish People - battling ISIS militants around the town. The Syrian Kurdish forces have long been one of the most effective fighting units battling ISIS, but the tide has turned in recent weeks as the  militants have attacked with heavy weapons, believed to belong to neighboring Iraq. Kobani sits on a road linking north and north-western Syria. Kurdish control of the town has prevented ISIS fighters from consolidating their gains. The United States and five Arab allies launched an aerial campaign against ISIS in Syria early on Tuesday with the aim of crushing the extremist group. Elsewhere, hundreds of Kurdish activists and their supporters have protested in Paris to denounce violence by ISIS and demand greater Western support against the militants. Waving flags and chanting Kurdish songs, as many as 2,000 demonstrators marched  to demand greater firepower from the West to help the outgunned Kurds stave off assaults by ISIS.

"In 2005, Kristine Matheson was told she had between six and 12 months left to live. The Gold Coast woman had tumours on her lungs and her lymph nodes and was told the cancer was inoperable because it was so close to her aorta. Nine years later Mrs Matheson, 64, is still alive – a feat she claims is thanks to the mostly raw, vegan diet that 'cured' her cancer. Now she runs seminars around Australia, retreats in Byron Bay, and has released a book to teach other cancer sufferers that they can heal themselves by changing their diet. But one of Australia's leading oncologists warns it is 'dangerous' to shun conventional medicine based on one woman's personal experience. Scroll down for video . Kristine Matheson (pictured right, with her husband Wayne) in 2012 was told she had had cancer in 2005 and had between six and 12 months left to live. Nine years later she is still alive . Mrs Matheson pictured in 2004, just before she was told she had a malignant melanoma that metastasised . 'I don't condemn anyone for exploring all sorts of options when they have cancer but I think they should explore conventional medicine and not go off someone else's story,' said Ian Olver, CEO of Cancer Council Australia. Mrs Matheson said when she found out she had cancer she was told she was not able to undergo chemotherapy or radiation. Her doctor Dzung Price, a registered GP who combines conventional medicine with alternative treatments, said Mrs Matheson had a malignant melanoma that metastasised. 'It went from her skin to the lymph nodes in her chest behind her sternum,' Dr Price said. 'That's why they couldn't do chemo or radiotherapy on her, it's not a good area to do that.' Mrs Matheson said she wouldn't have considered either option even if they had been available. The Gold Coast woman, 64, had tumours on her lungs and her lymph nodes and was told the cancer was inoperable because it was so close to her aorta. She is pictured in 2010 . Mrs Matheson pictured in 2005 while she had cancer . 'My husband beat cancer four years before I met him in 1984, and he opened me up to a lot of pathways to natural healing,' she said. 'I did nothing except the diet, mediation and positive affirmations. 'If we dealt with the cause and stopped eating so much junk food there wouldn't be so much cancer.' Dr Price said she believed Mrs Matheson's diet was 'a big part of' why she got better. 'She had a belief system that allowed her to get well,' she said. 'I see a lot of patients that choose not to go down that path [of conventional treatment] and it does happen [that they get better], especially when people aren't given any other options. 'I usually suggest people have an integrated approach and take the best of both worlds.' After her diagnosis, Mrs Matheson started a month-long eating program to get rid of the candida in her gut. She was already a vegan, but she also cut out sugar, fruit, coffee, alcohol, dairy, yeast and anything fermented. Next, she embarked on a 28-day cleanse, consuming fruit juices, vegetable broths and herbal teas only. After that was finished, she started following an 80 percent raw, mostly vegan diet – one that she still follows now. 'My breakfast every morning is still the same, I have fruit salads and cashew cream,' Mrs Matheson said. 'I soak a cup of cashews for an hour or two or overnight then I put that in my blender with three cups of water and mix that up until it's think and creamy.' Now she still follows the 80 percent raw, mostly vegan diet says says 'cured' her. Pictured are raw tacos . The 64-year-old occasionally drinks a glass of wine, and if she eats out she might have a piece of cooked fish with some salad. Mrs Matheson says that five months after she started her diet program, she felt like her cancer was gone. 'The tumours sticking out of my neck were gone totally,' she said. Mrs Matheson's husband Wayne Matheson helps her give seminars and run retreats out of Byron Bay . 'I used to get breathless, because it was on my lungs, and I no longer did. 'I knew I was clean, I just knew.' A year later, she had a CT scan and an MRI to prove it. 'I didn't want to, but my mother said ""Why don't you get checked out, people are going to ask you"",' Mrs Matheson said. 'My doctor sent me to a surgeon and they just said ""You're clear"".' Mrs Matheson started getting contacted by people – some who had cancer and others worried they were going to get it – asking her for tips. In 2009 she decided to write a step-by-step guide. She says she knows of 30 people who have cured their cancer by following her methods – and estimates there are thousands of others out there who have bought her book that she's never heard from. When Mrs Matheson received her diagnosis in 2005 she and her husband Wayne Matheson, 69, were in the middle of a court case because the property development company they ran was defrauded of $7 million. The couple lost everything and Mrs Matheson believes the stress of the ordeal contributed to her cancer. 'Through that process I stopped eating properly, I was eating too much cooked food,' she said. 'The stress got to me and I couldn't believe these people we're so dishonest.' Now they live in a rental property in Robina and their main source of income is the retreat program they run out of Byron Bay every couple of months. They rent out a property for a group of nine to 10 people, charging them $2347 each for the weekend, where they do meditation exercises and eat raw food. Mrs Matheson's 'raw Christmas puddings'. She says that five months after she started her diet program, she felt like her cancer was gone . The Mathesons also run seminars, with one scheduled in Mackay in Queensland later this month, and they have plans to travel around the country next year. 'I always get letters from all over the place asking ""Are you ever going to come here?""' she said. The seminars cost between $28 and $147 – depending on how far the couple have to travel and whether food and recipe books are included. Mrs Matheson doesn't have any health or science qualifications, and everything she teaches is based on her own personal experience. Her husband is currently studying a bachelor of health science in naturopathy and muscular skeletal therapy. 'One of the reasons why Wayne is doing naturopathy is that as I get bigger out there and more well-known, he felt if he can do naturopathy then one of us has got a certificate in case we ever get questioned,' she said. Mrs Matheson's 'raw ravioli', which she serves at retreats and seminars . Mrs Matheson says she doesn't charge the people who get in contact with her directly asking for advice – and only accepts money if they insist. 'I do meals, I do Skype and I don't charge anybody,' she said. 'The reason I don't charge is that I feel that everybody that's got cancer, when they're searching to get well, all these people are waiting for them to walk in the door and take advantage of them because they're sick. 'If the integrity's in what I do and they're going to get well they've got to believe in what I'm giving to them and not what they're paying for.' Mrs Matheson started getting contacted by people – some who had cancer and others worried they were going to get it – asking her for tips. In 2009 she decided to write a step-by-step guide . Mrs Matheson also says that she is doesn't tell people outright that they shouldn't undergo more conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation – she just tries to steer them in another direction. 'I'm not going to tell people what to do, they've got to make their own educated judgement,' she said. 'Mind you I tell them they've got to be crazy... I wouldn't do it to my body. 'The bottom line is I'll try and convince them to focus on nutrition.' Cancer Council Australia CEO Mr Olver warned cancer sufferers against following dietary programs such as Mrs Matheson's in place of conventional treatments. 'I'm obviously pleased that she's well but I think everyone has got to look at what treatments are available,' Mr Olver said. 'She's told her story which is fine, but extrapolating that and saying everyone should abandon proven cancer treatments, to say everyone should try changing their diet instead, is dangerous.' Mr Olver said two thirds of patients diagnosed with cancer today will still be alive in five years' time, which is an improvement since 10 years ago. 'Even if the treatment worked what we don't know is does it work one out of every two occasions, one out of every 100?' he said. 'I think people should explore options but I think they've got to ask questions like how does this apply to me and how often does it work.'","Kristine Matheson was told she had 6-12 months left to live in 2005 .

"The First World War make have taken place 100 years ago, but it seems we still do not know all the secrets of life fighting in the trenches, or the full scale of the horror the troops faced. A new collection of images documents long-forgotten caverns and quarries across France, Belgium, Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine where soldiers from both sides sheltered, carving haunting figures and faces into the soft rock walls while they hid from the bombs above. The quarries, which were used as underground cities and contain human remains, are preserved almost exclusively by local residents while many of them are unknown to the wider public and even to historians. The quarries often connected to the trenches above, and became established fighting bases for thousands of men. Journalists who visited them during the conflict describe chapels carved into the rock, fires lit underground, and rooms strewn with straw for men to sleep on. Haunting: Photographer Jeff Gusky spent months locating these quarries, which were turned into underground cities by soldiers during the First World War, and are littered with artworks carved into the walls . Buried: The location of the hidden cities, and the artworks within, have been all but lost to historians and the wider public, except for local landowners and mayors who work to preserve them . Carving out history: While men sheltered in the dark from the deadly shells above, they were able to use simple tools to carve into the soft limestone walls, creating works of art and poignant tributes . Hush: While some of the carvings were made in quarries, others were left daubed along tunnels left behind by sappers trying to bury explosives under enemy lines - and listening out for troops coming the other way, which could spell death . Secret: Dr Gusky, who works a day job as a physician, spent months building up a network of local landowners and mayors who were able to lead him to the tunnels and the carvings within . Forgotten: Often soldiers used abandoned mines for shelter (left) setting up hiding places underground away from the shelling (right) Safety: While sheltering underground, many troops left behind carvings, while others drew on the walls in pencil (pictured) One German trench system incorporated a medieval quarry more than seven miles long, filling it with a bakery, a butcher's, electric lights, telephones and a machine shop. They even gave the passages street names and engraved them on the walls to stop people getting lost. Among the stranger inscriptions are those made by the 26th 'Yankee' Division after America entered the war in 1917. The raw recruits decorated every inch of one cavern in France with portraits of Uncle Sam, alongside caricatures of the Kaiser. Some of the artworks were also left on narrow tunnel walls carved out by the infamous sappers of the First World War who dug tunnels under enemy lines to plant explosives, made famous in Sebastian Faulks' book Birdsong. American physician and fine art photographer Jeffrey Gusky has captured more than 2,000 images of the forgotten shelters, and is publishing them in a new collection called The Hidden World Of World War I. He said: 'The project gives us a glimpse into the individual humanity of soldiers who refused to be silenced in the face of modern mass destruction. 'Men from both sides defied the inhuman scale of modern life and declared themselves as human beings who could think and feel and express and create, and who remind us today that they were here and that they once existed as living, breathing human beings.' Hidden: A set of stairs leads down into some of the underground caverns which were used by soldiers as shelter during World War One . Striking: Dr Gusky said the tunnels and works of art they contain often appeared as if they had been carved recently, with the pencil marks on the walls appearing fresh (pictured, a reinforced tunnel which forms part of the new photography collection) Digging deep: Some of the underground communities were so well established that electronics were even connected, such as this device, which resembles a modern-day telephone receiver . Sign of life: This vent poking up above the ground is the only outward sign of the network of tunnels buried beneath . Honoured dead: The collection of photographs also contains images of war graves in France in tribute to the men who gave their lives there .","Soldiers incorporated medieval quarries into trench systems, complete with chapels, bakeries and butcher's shops .

"A co-founder of the frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry has been sentenced to seven years in prison for beating a homeless man with a tire iron in Los Angeles. Forty-nine-year-old millionaire, Young Lee, who is no longer affiliated with Pinkberry, was sentenced to the maximum term Friday. A jury convicted Lee of assault with a deadly weapon last November and the judge declared him to be a significant threat to the community. Scroll down for video... Guilty: The co-founder of frozen yogurt giant Pinkberry was convicted of beating a homeless man with a tire iron last year, while the victim . begged on the side of an East Hollywood street . No fro-yo for him: The co-founder of frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry was sentenced Friday to a maximum seven years in prison for beating a panhandling homeless man with a tire iron . Prosecutors said Lee confronted Daniel . Bolding in June 2011 after the transient flashed a sexually explicit . tattoo to several people in Lee's car, including his fiancee. Words were exchanged, and Lee drove . away, but came back with another man who'd been in the car and beat . Bolding.Bolding was struck twice on the head and suffered a broken arm before witnesses stopped the attack. Lee's defense attorney Philip Kent Cohen claimed the man made threats to his client as if he had a weapon, but police say it was a sexually explicit tattoo on the homeless man that triggered Lee to get out of his vehicle and go after the victim. According to prosecutors, court documents show Lee viewed the tattoo as a sign of disrespect. He . demanded the homeless man kneel and apologize, but even after the man . consented, police say Lee proceeded to kick and beat him with the tire . iron. Jailed: County Superior Court Judge Henry Hall, who declared Young Lee a 'significant threat to the community' because he had threatened a witness in the case . Beaten Up: Bolding flashed a tattoo of a stick-figure couple having sex to the people in Lee's car, which included his fiancee . Korean-born Young Lee began frozen yoghurt chain Pinkberry with his business partner Hye Kyung Hang in 2005 - and the brand has since grown from one store in Los Angeles to more than 100 across the country. The chain's rapid growth made Lee a wealthy man and he owned a luxury home with a fleet of luxury cars including a Rolls-Royce Phantom and Ferrari 599 GTB at the time of his arrest. A number of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian number among Pinkberry's devoted fan following, and the company prides itself on having 'groupies' across the country. Lee left the company in 2010. Phillip Kent Cohen, Lee's attorney, said he and the prosecutor agreed on '96% of what happened: that there was a tire iron and that [Bolding] was given great bodily injury.' But Cohen said his client never held the tire iron, and he attempted to cast doubt on the testimony of witnesses who identified Lee as the attacker, including saying that Bolding had 'flat-out lied.' In the initial police report, Cohen said, Bolding alleged that he was arguing with the driver, whom he identified as Lee. Bolding said the man in the passenger seat had the tire iron. But during the trial, Bolding testified that Lee had beaten him with the tire iron. Bolding has also filed a personal injury lawsuit against Lee seeking damages for the attack. After the beating, Lee traveled to Korea and England. He was arrested Jan. 30, 2012, at Los Angeles International Airport by a fugitive task force. The jury deliberated for less than two days before reaching a guilty verdict in the three-week-long trial. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Henry Hall said that evidence during the trial showed that Lee had made significant threats to witnesses and considered him a 'threat to the community.' During the trial, the prosecutor reminded the jury of the threat to the witness, David Lee. 'Do you remember the moment when David Lee stood on the witness stand and told us he'd been threatened?' Deputy Dist. Atty. Bobby Zoumberakis asked the jury Wednesday during closing arguments. ''I'm going to cut the throat of your mother, your wife, your daughter and you.' And remember how the air left the room because you could tell how scared David Lee was?' Lee was arrested after a witness called police and gave the license plate number of the Range Rover involved, which was rented in Lee's name. Lee, a kick-boxer-turned-architect-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang. They opened their first location in West Hollywood in 2005, gaining a celebrity following and sparking a frozen yoghurt craze. The entrepreneur was previously sentenced to two days in jail and three years probation stemming from a cocaine charge and the carrying of a loaded firearm in 2001. Lee now begins seven years in state prison although he has been behind bars since his conviction last year as he was not granted bail.","Young Lee, 48, became upset in June 2011 that Daniel Bolding had flashed a tattoo depicting a stick-figure couple having sex to the people in Lee's car, which included his fiancee .

"Youth: AA Milne served in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment before his work in MI7b, a propaganda unit . Secret documents saved from a skip have shed new light on Winnie the Pooh author AA Milne's clandestine role as a propagandist in the First World War. All evidence of MI7b, the secret military intelligence unit where AA Milne was based, was feared lost - because government officials ordered the destruction of its entire archive. But 150 classified documents were taken home by Captain James Lloyd and remained a secret for nearly 100 years, including a never-before seen satirical poem by Milne. It imagines what famous great writers like Tennyson and Shakespeare would have written had they been propaganda writers in MI7b. Milne became a pacifist after the war and the verse shows his struggle with the work he undertook. The secret stash of files were due to . be dumped into a skip during a house clear-out, but fortunately was . rescued by Captain Lloyd's great nephew Jeremy Arter, 61. The document-filled trunk is the only surviving evidence of MI7b's existence and provides a crucial insight into how the children's author responsible for Winnie the Pooh worked for Military Intelligence. Mr Arter, who coincidentally also worked in army propaganda as a Major in the Royal Army Educational Corps, said: 'Much of the household belongings were due to go in a skip. 'I was about to throw everything away but, leafing through, I saw a book with MI7b written on it and decided to take a closer look. 'When I turned the front cover and when I saw the name AA Milne I knew it would be a historic document.' Treasure trove: Jeremy Arter, 61, discovered documents that shed light on Winnie the Pooh author AA Milne's secret role as a propagandist in the First World War . Lucky: The documents were plucked from a  skip by Mr Arter, who realised their importance soon afterwards . Some Earlier Propagandists . (As they would have written, if only they had been properly organised) Captain William Shakespeare, of a Cyclist Battalion . In M.I.7.B, . Who loves to lie with me . About atrocities . And Hun Corpse Factories. Come hither, come hither, come hither, . Here shall he see . No enemy, . But sit all day and blether . 'The Green Book' was a tongue-in-cheek comic created by the MI7b writers when their unit was disbanded at the end of the war. Before his propaganda work, Milne served with the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. MI7b was established in 1916 to sustain support for the war when the enormous numbers of soldiers were being killed and anti-war movements were sweeping war-torn Europe. The secret propaganda unit wrote thousands of positive newspaper articles about Victoria Cross winners, heroism and sanitised accounts of life in the trenches. The work sat poorly with Milne, who famously once wrote a denunciation of war titled Peace With Honour. Mr Arter said: 'There are about 150 separate articles made up of pencil drafts, manuscripts, and typescripts, along with notebooks and photographs. 'I was astonished when my research showed that they were meant to have been destroyed soon after the war because they were deemed ""too incriminating"". 'He broke every rule in the book and took his work home with him - that's the only reason any evidence survived.' Propagandist: Captain James Lloyd worked with AA Milne in MI7b. He was injured in the First Battle of the Somme in 1916 . It is the first time the work by Milne has been seen. He was already a successful professional playwright and author when he was recruited by Military Intelligence. He went on to publish his first Winnie the Pooh book in 1926 and had a long and successful career before he died in 1956. Capt Lloyd worked alongside Milne in the secret propaganda unit after being recruited while recovering in London from his battle wounds. The vicar's son from Aberedw, Mid Wales, served in the Welsh Regiment during the early years of the First World War. Mr Arter with the Green Book, which contains a poem written by AA Milne about the moral difficulty of writing propaganda . Milne's poem was a satire that imagined great writers as propagandists in MI7b . Insight: One of the previously unseen documents discovered in the stash . AA Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories are based on his son Christopher Robin’s adventures with his toy bear 'Growler' in Ashdown Forest, Sussex. Christopher Robin Milne's toys - Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo and Tigger - were incorporated into the stories. Pooh first appeared in the London Evening News on Christmas Eve, 1925, in a story called 'The Wrong Sort Of Bees'. The stories became an immediate hit here and especially across the Atlantic. Despite being an avowed pacifist, he served during World War II as a Captain of the Home Guard. Milne died in January 1956, aged 74. He was wounded leading an attack at . Mametz during the first Battle of the Somme on 7 July 1916 and returned . to Britain to recuperate. A year after he was wounded in battle Capt Lloyd was recruited by MI7b and began writing stirring stories from the front lines. MI7b . recruited around 20 writers plucked from the cream of British writing . talent at time and produced 7,500 articles between 1916 and 1918. Intelligence historian Andrew Cook said the unit worked closely with newspaper publishers and kept an eye on the foreign press, countered negative stories, and wrote material intended for leaflets dropped by hot air balloons. Mr Cook said: 'It was set up in 1916 when casualties were mounting and there were large numbers of dead. This was having a major impact. 'As the war soldiered on into 1916 and 1917 there was unofficial industrial action that concerned the government. 'Prime Minister Lloyd George and his government also knew that the Russian revolution started in a small way after food shortages and there were fears that could happen here.' He has written about the surviving secret documents in his e-book: 'MI7b - the discovery of a lost propaganda archive from the Great War'. Pooh Bear: Milne's creation has become one of the most enduring and popular characters in children's literature . MI7 was a subsection of the now-defunct British Military Intelligence Section 7 (MI7). It was a department of the British Directorate of Military Intelligence and was set up to work in the fields of propaganda and censorship to counter growing disenchantment with the First World War as casualties mounted. The writers in MI7b, also said to have included the Irish poet and novelist Patrick MacGill, produced 7,500 articles between 1916 and 1918. Experienced journalist Captain A. J. Dawson was instructed to prepare a plan for obtaining propaganda articles. A notice was posted in all officer's messes, inviting officers with literary experience to apply. Another branch of the work of the subsection which soon became important was thepreparation of propaganda pamphlets to be dropped from planes and the translation of articles for the foreign press. The staff of MI7b grew from one to 24 in just nine months. It was housed in Adelphi Court in the Strand in Westminster, before moving to Adastral House, in Victoria Embankment.","The children's author was a propaganda writer for the mysterious 'MI7b'

"A seriously-ill father who needs a double organ transplant to keep him alive is facing a second battle to stop his wife and daughter being forced to return to Australia. Forklift driver Peter Mark, from Widnes, Cheshire, was diagnosed with a rare disease in September last year and has since faced an excruciating wait for a kidney and liver transplant. At the time, the 32-year-old was living in Australia with 22-year-old Shauna, but he soon had to leave his wife and their baby daughter  to return to the UK for urgent dialysis treatment. Scroll down for video . Peter Mark, from Widnes, Cheshire, is in desperate need of a double organ transplant but is also facing a battle to stop his wife Shaun and ten-month-old daughter Lylah being sent back to Australia . The 32-year-old spent six months away from his daughter after having to leave Australia to be treated at the Royal Liverpool Hospital for a rare condition, primary hyperoxaluria type one . Now, after six months apart, Mrs Mark and the ten-month-old Lylah have flown to the UK, where they have been reunited with Mr Mark. But, in just five months, Mrs Mark will be forced to return to Australia because she does not have the correct visa to stay in the UK permanently - unless they can prove they have enough money to support themselves. Speaking about the ordeal, Mr Mark said: 'The time we spent apart were the hardest six months of my life. 'Shauna is keeping me positive all the time. We're heading for an immigration aid group to see if they can help.' Mr Mark met his wife while he was helping victims of the floods in Bundaberg during a trip to Australia. At the time, he had a visa as a skilled worker. After meeting the soon-to-be Mrs Mark, he planned on starting a new life in Australia. The pair married in December 2013 but their honeymoon was short-lived, as Mr Mark had to return to the UK . The young family are now in the UK together but Mrs Mark only has a holiday visa to be here until March . But he was diagnosed with primary hyperoxaluria type one - a rare condition affecting just one person per 1million  - months later. Mr Mark had surgery, but medics told him he would need dialysis until he has a double transplant. His sickness meant he could no longer have a sponsored Australian visa and Mr Mark had to fly home in April, leaving his beloved family behind. At the time, Lylah - who was born in March - was just six weeks old. He has since been receiving dialysis at the Royal Liverpool Hospital for eight hours, three evenings a week. Mr Mark was in hospital being treated while his 22-year-old wife was pregnant (left). She gave birth to Lylah in March this year (right) Meanwhile, Mrs Mark sold her belongings and flew to Britain to be with her husband. But Mrs Mark is only in the UK on a holiday visa, which says she must return to Australia in March 2015. Because Mr Mark lives in the UK permanently, Mrs Mark could to apply to obtain a ‘family of a settled person’ visa. But part of that application involves proving Mr and Mrs Mark have enough money to adequately support and accommodate themselves and Lylah without relying on public funds. Mr Mark met his wife in Australia in 2013 after he had been in Bundaberg, Queensland, helping victims of the floods (pictured) Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 - known as PH1 - leads to end stage renal failure. It is caused by the shortage  of an enzyme (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase) that normally prevents the buildup of oxalate - a chemical found in plant foods. Without the enzyme, oxalate builds up leading to kidney stones. These stones can cause urinary obstruction, urine infection and eventually kidney damage and other organ failure. Oxalate stones in PH tend to be severe, resulting in relatively early kidney damage which impairs the excretion of oxalate. This leads to a further acceleration in accumulation of oxalate in the body. Dialysis can control renal failure but tends to be inadequate to dispose of excess oxalate. Renal (kidney) transplant is the primary treatment of severe hyperoxaluria. Liver transplantation is also used to control the disease by correcting the metabolic defect. Primary hyperoxaluria is estimated to occur in 1 per million people. Government rules state that if the UK resident is on disability allowance, the spouse does not have to prove they cannot support themselves. But Mr Mark cannot obtain sickness benefit as he must be back in the UK for 52 weeks before he can claim. Guidelines say a spouse who is applying for a five-year visa must show they have £22,400 per year for themselves and one child. As Mr Mark is unable to work, and Mrs Mark is only on a holiday visa, the pair do not have an income. The couple - who are currently  staying with Mr Mark's parents, Lesley and Brian - now face a race against time to try and keep their family together. Mr Mark said: 'My mum and dad have been brilliant. I couldn't ask for better parents. 'My little girl and my wife are keeping me going.' Mrs Mark's sister, Tara Auer, has now launched a fundraising appeal for her brother-in-law. She wants to raise enough money so the family can live together in the UK. They also hope enough money is raised so Mr Mark can have his treatment privately. Mrs Auer said: 'All this family want is to be together, happy and healthy. 'Peter has no job and no money. All he wants is to work and provide for his family but his body will not let him. 'I am campaigning to raise awareness and funds for Peter.' Mr Mark said: We can't thank our family and friends enough for all their help and support. Everyone has been brilliant.' MailOnline has contacted the Home Office for comment. Some people really get dealt with a heartbreaking story. My sister Shauna and her beautiful family Peter and Lylah have had far more than their fair share of bad luck. Peter has a rare disease causing kidney and liver failure - needing a transplant urgently. He was going through all the right channels to get sponsorship in Australia as a skilled worker when his continued worsened making him unable to work and was let go by the sponsoring employer. Being a liability to Australia and urgently needing a transplant his citizenship of Australia was rejected... he had to scrap together to get a ticket back to the UK, after a long and stressful trip home ensuring he was able to survive the flight without dialysis - leaving his wife and 2 month old baby here in Australia he returned to the UK. Peter spend 6 months away from his love Shauna and his baby girl Lylah. Peter missed 6 months of his daughters life - first tooth, standing up, her smiles and all of the other beautiful moments that can't be replaced. The only contact they had was skype. Six months later my sister Shauna was able to save enough with help from generous friends and family to go to the UK for a while to visit her husband and reunite the family. The trip wasn't ideal with an 8 month old baby to a foreign country, to top off the situation she was interrogated in customs and was almost declined entry into the country, as they assumed she wasn't going to return to Australia. Along with this Peter was again struck down and was in the emergency ward. Now 6 weeks in and life has been steady for this family - together everyday and enjoying the small things in life. Peter still waiting to be put onto the transplant list, his condition has worsened. Making him unable to attend work as much as he would like and to provide for his family. Today Peter was again let go as he wasn't able to attend as require due to emergency hospital making him unable to work. Peter requires a minimum 3 x 5 hours of dialysis per week - 3 days a week and after dialysis he is drained and ill. Unfortunate lately he has required to spend so many nights in hospital to be able to survive. With Peter not being able to work and Shauna having just a visiting visa (non-working) as she was declined citizenship or a working visa due to having a baby they have no source of income and are literally unable to live. Unfortunately they don't have enough money to even pay board or food or even travel expenses getting to and from hospital. Their families have done everything they can do for them and will continue to support them as much as possible within their means but unfortunately that doesn't go far. Please share and spread this post as much as possible. All I want is for my sister and her family to be happy and healthy. I hope that this becomes a post that reaches so many people that care and people that want a young beautiful family to be together. The future for this family is very uncertain and all they want to do is be together. Please, if you aren't able to help please share this story...

"US tycoon Donald Trump's first Scottish boutique hotel has been given the highest possible rating by tourism body VisitScotland. Macleod House and Lodge, located next to the Trump International Golf Links course in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, has been awarded five star status. The sprawling mansion, which has been extensively renovated to turn it into a 19 bedroom luxury hotel, sits just a hundred yards from the tycoon's championship 18-hole links course. Macleod House and Lodge, Donald Trump's boutique Scottish hotel, has been given the highest possible rating by tourism body VisitScotland . Sarah Malone, Executive Vice President of Trump International, said they were ‘thrilled’ to be given the top rating for accommodation in Scotland. She said: ‘Mr Trump has invested millions in the renovation and restoration of a really important, historic building in the north-east of Scotland. ‘It is right in the heart of our estate. ‘We've built this entire service from scratch and we pride ourselves on hiring the best staff possible - those that have a natural aptitude for hospitality. A 'whisky snug' is hidden in the basement with comfy armchairs in which to savour a wide selection of malts on offer - including his own limited edition . ‘We want to take care of the whole guest experience and pay attention to the smallest of details. ‘We know that the standards with VisitScotland are very high so we are thrilled that they have recognised us with the highest award.’ Macleod House and Lodge was opened with little fanfare at the end of 2013, but has seen a steady stream of guests - including Mr Trump himself and his golfing friends from America. And when the Scottish Open was hosted at Royal Aberdeen earlier this year, the hotel welcomed world class golfers including Justin Rose, Phil Mickelson and Rory McIlroy. The spacious mansion house has been carefully restored and upgraded to offer the highest level of guest accommodation, dining, bar and lounge facilities.

"Most James Bond fans know their favourite secret agent as suave and sexy, with a naughty glint in his eye. Spanish readers, however, believe 007 is far more conservative. Fifty years after the first book was published, Spaniards are still reading heavily censored versions, with suggestive words including 'virgin' and 'breast' deleted from the text. Too racy: Sean Connery in the 1965 film version of Thunderball with dark-haired beauty Claudine Auger . Body of the text: Ursula Andress in Dr No, 1963, which also . starred Sean Connery. Spanish readers might not recognise the tale, . however, because the last two pages of the book were cut . Bangor University academic Dr Jordi Cornella-Detrell, who discovered that the censored versions are still being reproduced, said the news was 'disconcerting and difficult to explain'. Strict censors in Madrid originally cut passages from Ian Fleming's books before allowing them to be published while the country was under dictator General Franco's rule in the 1940. THUNDERBALL (1974) These 'poor erotic descriptions' were cut: . The mounded V of the bikini looked up at Bond and the proud breasts in the tight cups were two more eyes. She kept her arms round his neck while he undid the single button of the brassiere and then the tapes of the taut slip. He stepped out of his bathing trunks and kicked them away. The general impression, Bond decided, was of a willful, high-tempered, sensual girl — a beautiful Arab mare who would only allow herself to be ridden by a horseman with steel tights and velvet hands, and then only with curb and saw-bite – and then only when he had broken her to bridle and saddle. He bent down and hooked his fingers in the neckline of her shirt and the join of the brassiere. Very slowly, but with great force, he tore downwards, the whole length of her. Then he threw aside the torn halves of material and exposed the whole gleaming length of her body. His right hand held the memory of a beautiful breast. DR NO (1960/74) These passages were cut: . 'You don't have to make love to me… We could go to sleep back to front, you know, like spoons.' 'You're a wonderful girl. I thought so directly I saw you.''Saw my behind, you mean.' The voice was getting drowsy, but it was full of pleasure. Bond laughed. 'Well, it was a wonderful behind. And the other side was wonderful too.' She stepped down into the bath and lay at full length. The fair hair on her body glittered up through the water like golden sovereigns. She said provocatively, 'You've got to wash me. I don't know what to do.' 'Why don't you like playing? I want to play at being married.' Bond bent his head down into the warm soft hand and bit softly into the swelling. He felt her other hand in his hair. He bit harder. She was panting. He bit still harder. She gave a little scream and wrenched his head away by the hair. She undid her blouse and threw it on the floor. Then her skirt. She undid his shirt and slowly, carefully took it off. The girl let go his hand and climbed into the sleeping-bag. She looked up at him. She said, practically, 'It's a double one. It cost a lot of money. Take those off and come in. You owe me slave-time.' The behind was almost as firm and rounded as a boy's. The muscles of her behind bunched with tension. Bond could feel the hairs on his leg being parted. It was an insect. [The word ‘hairs’ was censored in this particularly bizarre example.] . Even today, almost all the books remain censored and in some, entire chapters are omitted. Dr Cornella-Detrell, a lecturer in Hispanic studies, said Spain did not want the books published at all. 'During Franco’s regime, foreign ideas . were perceived as a potential threat to the moral and social fabric of . the country,' he said. 'The regime promoted the very Catholic nature of Spain and . censored literature that was at odds with this or with its political . stance. Ian Fleming’s novels were fairly sexually explicit . and salacious for that era. 'Attempts to publish the novel were met with fierce opposition by the Spanish censors.' Dr Cornella-Detrell originally set out . to research censorship during Franco's regime, and was surprised to see that the discrepancies between the English and Spanish versions of sixth Bond novel Dr No still existed. He went on to find . that many edited versions of translated novels in the country are still being republished and read in Spain today. 'A translation of Dr No presented in 1960 . was rejected outright by the censors,' he said. 'Five years later, they forced . substantial cuts on the editor. 'The last two pages of the novel were deemed to be pornographic and completely excised. As a consequence the ending feels rushed and makes little sense. 'The . effects of censorship on this text, however, did not end with the . regime’s collapse, since expurgated versions of Dr No were reprinted in . 1996, 2001 and 2011. Dr Cornella-Detrell is now keen to explore why the advent of . democracy did not stop the production, circulation and consumption of . censored books. He said: 'It is a well known fact that Spaniards have found it difficult . to come to terms with and confront their problematic recent history. 'The so-called ‘pact of forgetting’, a conscious decision . not to question or examine the past in order to facilitate the . transition to democracy, has prevented readers, libraries and publishing . companies from developing strategies to address this issue. Some books . have been retranslated or restored, but as a result of the general . amnesia surrounding the regime’s cultural policies, these efforts have . passed largely unnoticed, to the point that Spanish public libraries, . unaware of the problem, still promote the reading of censored . materials.' 'I want to see this issue raised and discussed more widely in Spain so . that readers in Spain can have access to re-translated or restored . books.' Fleming's novels are not the only English-language classics that have remained edited or unavailable in Spain. Other examples include John Dos Passos’s Parallel 42, Muriel Spark’s . The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s Baby, Carson . McCuller's The Member of the Wedding and J.M Cain’s The Postman Always . Rings Twice.","Censorship began during General Franco's regime .

"It has stood on Chicago's historic South Prairie Avenue since 1888, but on Tuesday the Harriet Rees Mansion began a two-day trek just one block north, or 600 feet away.

The house was encased in a steel frame and raised onto 32 massive motorized dollies for the 600-foot move . 'The house, including all the equipment and the beams, this weighs around 1,050 tons,' said Peter Kuhn, senior executive project manager at Bulley & Andrews to DNAINFO. 'The project will take three days to move the building from from its original location to its relocation site. 'You don't see houses move like this every day.' Since 2002, the Harriet Rees House has been the last mansion left standing on South Prairie Avenue and its move has been eagerly anticipated by local residents.

'This is very exciting,' said Linda Jones, 45, to DNAINFO. 'I've never seen anything like this done before. I wish I'd seen how they got the house on the beams.' Moving the home has not been an easy engineering task. 'We excavated around the house. We put in three main beams which run the length of the house. Then we put a series of crossbeams on top of those that run the width of the house,' said Kuhn to NBC Chicago. 'After that we jacked it up approximately 8 feet. Now it is on a set of 29 dollies, each of which have eight wheels on it.' William Tyre, executive director and curator of Glessner House Museum and author of 'Chicago's Historic Prairie Avenue said the move was costing millions.

The 37-year-old is not believed to be part of any terrorist organisation, with a close friend telling the ABC he is a 'lone wolf' but is erratic due to his use of the drug ice. In Jordan's state security court in Amman this month, Hasanat was accused of using the internet 'to carry out activity that could expose Jordan to acts of aggression' following his threats against the Australian embassy. He denied any wrongdoing during the hearing, but faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty. The trial was adjourned earlier this month to give Hasanat time to find a lawyer. His threats against the Australian government appear to have been motivated by a family matter. Hasanat shows a boy how he describes as 'may [sic] brother' how to correctly hold a pistol . In Queensland he was sentenced to multiple stints in jail, including eight months in 2008 for threatening, using a carriage service to menace or harass and assault occasioning bodily harm . 'To any mother f***er from Australian government in or outside Australia this message is for you as you can tell I am not wearing a mask or hiding my identity you have been denying me my daughter for over 10 years now for no reason at all,' he posted on Facebook in April. 'Listen here you putrid son of a b****s stupid ignorant alcoholics I am no indian or aboriginal [sic] if you f*** with me I will have to f*** with you dying for my daughter will be an honour for me. 'I am not scared of dying for this cause you have 6 months from today which means you have till 26/10/2014 to fix this and give me a right to be a father.' While living in Australia, Hasanat had a son with a Gold Coast woman, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. In court in Amman this month, Hasanat was accused of using the internet 'to carry out activity that could expose Jordan to acts of aggression' The pair had arguments over social media in May, with Hasanat abusing the woman when she did not respond to some of his messages. In July, she wrote to him saying she loved him and was planning to move to Jordan, adding that she was 'hurt' that he faked his own death in a car crash. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said Hasanat's visa had been cancelled. 'The individual was removed from Australia and has been permanently excluded from Australia,' Mr Morrison said.

"Republican Dan Sullivan won Alaska's U.S. Senate seat in a hotly contested race, beating a first-term incumbent as voter disapproval of President Barack Obama swept Democrats out of office and allowed the GOP to seize control of the Senate. But Democratic Sen. Mark Begich is refusing to concede the race, insisting that there's a chance he could prevail after all the remaining absentee ballots are counted. 'Sen. Begich believes every vote deserves to be counted in this election,' campaign manager Susanne Fleek-Green told the Associated Press. 'There are tens of thousands of outstanding votes and Sen. Begich has heard from rural Alaskans that their votes deserve to be counted and their voices deserve to be heard. He will honor those requests.' Sullivan, a Marine Corps reservist and assistant secretary of State under President George W. Bush, defeated Begich as part of a wave of victories by Republicans, who picked up eight Senate seats. Another race is yet to be decided in Louisiana. FINALLY: Republican Senator-elect Dan Sullivan (left) won his election after a week of absentee-ballot counting and lots of posturing from both candidates . DONE: Sen. Mark Begich (right) has been declared an Election Day loser but refuses to concede the race . The Alaska contest was too close to call on Election Night, with Sullivan up by about 8,100 votes, but it became evident Tuesday when the state began counting about 20,000 absentee and questioned ballots that Begich could not overcome his opponent. Sullivan said in a statement that 'my door will always be open to all Alaskans.' 'While we have challenges to address, the opportunities in Alaska and our country are limitless,' he said. 'Today, we are going to begin the process of turning our country around.' Begich, who has returned to Washington for the lame-duck session, won office in 2008. That year, he went to bed on Election Night trailing a wounded but still powerful Sen. Ted Stevens, who days before the election had been convicted in a federal corruption trial. About two weeks later, Stevens conceded, with Begich winning by fewer than 4,000 votes. A judge later tossed the case against Stevens, causing many Republicans to see Begich's election as a fluke. The seat was initially considered key to the Republicans' hopes of controlling the U.S. Senate, but that goal was accomplished early on Election Night. Sullivan, a first-time candidate, ran a confident campaign, ignoring the debate schedule Begich released during the primary and setting his own agenda. He also attracted some star power to the state, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite, and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney rallying support. Sullivan pledged to fight federal overreach, talked about the need for an energy renaissance in the U.S. and at seemingly every opportunity, sought to tie Begich to Obama and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who are unpopular in Alaska. Begich said Sullivan offered little in the way of proposals for what he would do as senator. Begich touted his clout, including a position on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and tried to paint sharp contrasts between himself and Sullivan in areas such as women's health, education and Alaska issues. STAR POWER: Sullivan brought former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney to Anchorage, Alaska to press the flesh and recruit voters one day before polls opened . Election observers have been watching Alaska officials like hawks as they pore over questioned ballots cast during the Nov. 4 general election . For example, Begich was born and raised in Alaska. He cast Sullivan, who grew up in Ohio, as an outsider, and many of the early attacks by pro-Begich groups keyed in to that theme. That perception of Sullivan made for an at-times uncomfortable debate on fisheries issues, in which questioners grilled Sullivan about his knowledge of one of Alaska's most important industries. On several occasions, Sullivan's wife, Julie Fate Sullivan, an Alaska Native and frequent companion on the campaign trail, appeared in ads defending her husband's ties to the state and his positions on women's issues. Sullivan has roots in Alaska dating to the 1990s but was gone for nearly seven years for military service and work in Washington, D.C. He returned to Alaska in 2009, when he was appointed attorney general by then-Gov. Sarah Palin. He most recently served as Alaska's natural resources commissioner, a post he left in September 2013. Sullivan hit the ground running, exhibiting a fundraising prowess that rivaled and sometimes exceeded that of Begich. A turning point, in the view of many observers, was an ad from Begich's campaign shortly after the primary that painted Sullivan as soft on crime. It featured a man identified as a former Anchorage police officer standing outside the home where an elderly couple was beaten to death and a family member sexually abused in 2013. It ended with the man saying Sullivan should not be a senator. The ad, which Sullivan responded to with one of his own, was pulled after a demand from an attorney for the victims' family.","Dan Sullivan has been declared the winner in Alaska's Nov. 4 US Senate election .

"Tony Blair's religious charity has links to an Islamic extremist group being investigated by MI5 and MI6, it has been alleged. It has been claimed that two Muslim leaders, who have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, are advising The Tony Blair Faith Foundation. The organisation has been declared a terrorist group in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and could be banned in Britain, despite insisting they do not have links to extremist factions. Extremist links: Tony Blair, who set up the religious charity in 2008, has been accused of taking on controversial Muslim advisers . The Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Watch, which has been looking into the group for 13 years, revealed that Dr Ismail Khudr Al-Shatti, an adviser to the Kuwaiti government and a member of Mr Blair’s advisory council, is a leading member of the Kuwaiti branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. the Islamic Constitutional Movement (ICM). He is said to have told a crowd of Kuwaitis protesting over Palestine: 'Israel is an evil, and we can never live with evil,' according to a news agency report in 2000. In 1995, it was reported in America that a Palestinian terrorist group wrote to him requesting funds. Another Islamic adviser to Mr Blair is Mustafa Ceric, a Bosnian Muslim cleric who has made controversial statements about Islam in the Balkan states. The former Grand Mufti of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been linked to the the global Muslim Brotherhood through his membership of the European Council for Fatwa and Research. Controversial: Another Islamic adviser to Mr Blair is Mustafa Ceric, a Bosnian Muslim cleric who has made controversial statements about Islam in the Balkan states . The Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Watch says Mr Blair’s links to the Brotherhood through the men threatened to overshadow the charity's work. Steven Merley, a US investigator of extremist movements, who runs Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Watch, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Many groups don’t call themselves Muslim Brotherhood but they are linked to what I call the 'Global Muslim Brotherhood’. 'These individuals have fooled a lot of politicians, like Blair, who should know better. The very presence of people like Shatti and Ceric in the same room as him is a judgment on Blair.' The Muslim Brotherhood denies being an extremist organisation, and has asked Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, to help defend them. It has even threatened legal action against people who try to restrict their activities. David Cameron has asked the British intelligence . agencies to investigate the Islamic group, after they opened an . international office about a disused kebab shop in Cricklewood, London. After news of the inquiry into the activities emerged, it was revealed the group is moving its headquarters from London to Austria. A spokesman for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation told the paper they were 'grateful' for the work done by the pair and described them as 'great supporters of the foundation'. The oragnisation said they were not aware of the men's alleged links.

"Walk past Ray and Michele Blundell’s home near Lichfield in Staffordshire, and you might think you had stepped back 450 years. It is in the classic, half-timbered, Elizabethan style - built on an oak frame, with an ancient tiled roof, and the first floor teetering over the ground floor. In fact, the cottage is only 14 years old. What’s more, the Blundells built the whole thing from scratch, teaching themselves plumbing, electrical wiring and medieval carpentry into the bargain. Oh, and they also carved a majestic garden out of a dreary third-of-an-acre plot, which had only three plum trees and a lawn when they bought it. And all for only £200,000. Grand design: Ray and Michele Blundell's Tudor home. Built for £110,000, plus £90,000 to buy the land, it is now worth £600,000 - and the couple are planning a new wing . Majestic: Ray Blundell (pictured) and his wife Michele built the Elizabethan-style home in Lichfield, Staffordshire from scratch and lived in a static caravan during the construction . To the manor born: Ray and Michele Blundell are pictured in their living room, whose low ceilings were dictated by the height of the oaks used for the building . Four-poster splendour: The Elizabethan-style house, which took two-and-a-half years to complete, is packed with period furniture . Thanks to their efforts, it’s worth more than £600,000. But they’re not selling. ‘We’d both come out of divorces and had no money,’ says Ray, 69, about their 1998 decision. Ray was a sales director while Michele, 48, worked at a children’s nursery as they built the house. ‘We were looking for something to renovate. But, because everything was grade II-listed, we couldn’t make the changes we wanted. So we decided to build it instead. ‘I always liked drinking in old English pubs, with inglenook fireplaces,’ Ray says, ‘and oak is so tactile.’ In fact, Ray has since built another two - and sold them on - just down the road. But, to begin with, he and Michele were pretty much in the dark. After the Blundells bought the land for £90,000, they spent the next two-and-a-half years in a static caravan on the site, as their dream took shape. Building costs came to a total of £110,000. They bought the oak frame from a company in Herefordshire. ‘At first,’ says Ray, ‘the bank refused to give us money. They saw this pile of sticks in the yard, and thought we could never build a house out of them. ‘The man from the bank came back three weeks later, after the frame had been assembled, and was gobsmacked.’ Three builders put together the 20-ton frame on site but, after that, the Blundells were left with little more than a skeleton, open to the skies. First, they had to put a roof on. ‘I belong to a running club and, one day, I ran past a big house near Sutton Coldfield, where they were re-tiling the roof,’ says Ray, ‘The tiles he was taking down were better than the ones he was putting up! So I did a deal and bought 15,000 tiles. I borrowed a trailer from work to deliver them home.’ Tudor DIY: Builders put together the 20-ton frame on site but, after that, the Blundells were left with little more than a skeleton, open to the skies. Ray Blundell is pictured on the roof during construction in 1998 . Swish: The Blundells taught themselves how to plumb with great success. They also taught themselves electrical wiring and medieval carpentry . After the Blundells bought the land for £90,000, they spent the next two-and-a-half years in a static caravan on the site, as their dream took shape . Hands-on experience: A sledgehammer-wielding Michele Blundell works on the roof during the construction phase in 1999 . Ray taught himself how to tile a roof and to fill the panels between the timber framing. In Elizabethan times, those panels were built out of wattle and daub; nowadays, builders use a special insulation membrane that expands to fill any gaps as the oak dries. The joinery techniques Ray used are largely the same as they were in the 16th century. The box-like shape of the rooms is also typical of Elizabethan houses. The dimensions are still dictated by the height of the oak trees, as they were 450 years ago. And, just like Elizabethan houses, their cottage moved as the oak dried and shrank. ‘There were little gaps in the wall where the oak shrank,’ explains Ray. ‘You could see daylight through them — it was like seeing the sun through the stones at Stonehenge! But now we’ve filled the gaps and the house has stopped drying and shrinking.’ Having spent £200,000 on building the property, it is now worth in excess of £600,000. Mr Blundell has since built another two - and sold them on - just down the road .

The Blundells have more dreams that they want to turn into reality. The next scheme is a new greenhouse - oak-framed, of course . The Blundells haven’t finished yet, though. Lying in their front drive are 80 oak posts, which they are going to turn into a new wing. They’ve already bought an 18th- century monk’s bench to go inside. The extension will be based on the porch at Great Dixter - the 15th-century house in Sussex remodelled by Sir Edwin Lutyens, in 1912. It was later lived in by the late gardening writer Christopher Lloyd. The Blundells are impressive gardeners, too. That bare third of an acre has now been turned into a paradise of winding paths, classical urns, and borders crammed with dogwood trees and more than 100 Japanese maples. In one corner, there’s a stately pond, dug out with the same JCB that laid the foundations of the house. And the Blundells still want to turn their dreams into reality. The next scheme is a new greenhouse — oak-framed, of course.","Ray and Michele Blundell built their Elizabethan-style home in Lichfield, Staffordshire entirely from scratch .

"Lauren Graham (pictured) was left with a view of a metal gate for the entirety of the Ed Sheeran concert . A wheelchair-bound Ed Sheeran fan was left in tears during his concert after her view was obstructed by a metal gate and she was told to stand up when she complained about it to staff. Lauren Graham splashed out £77 on two tickets to watch her favourite singer perform at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena (NIA) on October 18. The disabled 24-year-old was left devastated after the vantage point she was given completely obstructed her view of the stage and she was stunned when told she should stand up when she complained to security staff. Instead of receiving help, she was forced to stare at large blue metal railings in tears for the duration of the one-and-a-half-hour gig. Yesterday Ms Graham, from Solihull, West Midlands, accused NIA of discrimination and said she was disgusted by the way they treated her. She fumed: 'Ed Sheeran's other two shows were sold out so we were very lucky to get tickets. I couldn't wait for it as he is one of my favourite singers. 'But when I got there I realised I couldn't see the stage. The gate obstructed the entire view and I do not understand how that is acceptable for the disabled bay. 'The door supervisor told my sister Ellie to just move me back and for me to stand up. I couldn't believe my ears. 'I found this incredibly rude and disrespectful considering that I can't stand up. He said the only other option was to move to the back of the arena. 'They just wanted to shove me out of the way where you barely see anyway. 'When my sister disagreed he dismissed her and stressed it was the only solution and could not offer any further help. 'I paid the same as able-bodied people but my view was compromised due to the poor layout and I received no help to rectify the situation. 'I felt discriminated against and I was left in tears for most of the evening. It completely ruined my night.' Ms Graham has Friedreich's Ataxia, a progressive neurological illness which effects her balance and prevents her from standing for long periods. When she complained about the view (pictured), the wheelchair-bound fan was told to move and stand up . She was diagnosed with the condition when she was nine-years-old but has been in a wheelchair since February. She emailed to complain about her treatment at the concert which she attended with her sister and carer Ellie, 21, and her friend Lizzie Mcinnerney, 21. But was outraged with the response she received last Tuesday  from the NIA - which is one of the biggest entertainment venues in Europe. Ms Graham, who works at Birmingham Airport on the check-in desk, said: 'They basically told me it was all our own fault. 'The door supervisor we named had a very different recollection of how he had helped us that evening. 'He said my sister shook his hand and said 'thank you' for being helpful, but that never happened. I know my sister, and she definitely didn't do that. 'They said the railings had been there for my own safety, what did they think I was going to do, roll off down the stairs in my wheelchair? 'They then emailed back a couple of weeks after saying maybe the staff member was having an ""off-day"", which I thought was a bit of a understatement but unprofessional to say anyway. Ms Graham had paid £77 for two tickets to the Ed Sheeran concert to cover entry for herself and a carer, and a friend. Pictured is Sheeran performing at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Glasgow three nights ago . The Ed Sheeran concert was held at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham (pictured) on October 18 . 'I've been to lots of concerts at other venues and have never had any problems like at the NIA. 'I won't be going back there, they have treated me appallingly.' Guy Dunstan, general manager of NEC Group which runs the NIA, said: 'Our customers' enjoyment is of the utmost importance and it is always disappointing to hear a visitor isn't satisfied with their experience. 'The barriers are essential for the safety of our visitors. 'Full consultations were held with the relevant groups and an independent assessor who represented disabled people whereby the use of these barriers was agreed as they are fully compliant in the disabled seating area. 'We pride ourselves on our customer service and our staff did their utmost to offer a solution as due to the popularity of the event alternative seating was not possible on this occasion. 'We are continually looking to improve our facilities to ensure complete customer satisfaction and take on board all feedback so this is something we are looking into.'","Lauren Graham, 24, was left in tears after her view was totally obstructed .

"The most brutal political ad of the 2012 election has blown up in the Obama campaign's face after blatant deceptions were revealed in the story of a woman who died of cancer following the closure of a steel mill owned by Mitt Romney's venture capital firm. Joe Soptic, who has appeared in an anti-Romney ad before, links the loss of his job and health benefits at a plant in Kansas City, Missouri, to his wife Ilyona succumbing to stage four cancer in the new commercial titled 'Understands.' Mr Soptic says Romney doesn't know what his private equity firm did to workers, 'and further, I don't think he's concerned.' However, it has come to light that Mrs Soptic had her own health insurance from her employer for years after her husband was laid off. Furthermore, the plant closed in 2001 - when Romney was no longer involved in the daily operation of the company - and Mrs Soptic died five years later in 2006. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Laid-off steel worker Joe Soptic blames Mitt Romney for his wife's cancer death after Bain Capital shut down the mill where he worked . Even nonpartisan observers are shocked at the half-truths and omissions in the ad, though the Obama campaign has refused to distance itself from the story. CNN says the ad is 'not accurate.' The Washington Post's Fact Checker gave the commercial 'four Pinoccios,' the lowest possible truth rating, calling it a 'whopper' of a lie. The commercial was released on Tuesday by Priorities USA . Action, the super PAC supporting the president's reelection campaign. The president can officially disavow the attack by saying it was produced by an . independent group, but the PAC is run by two former White House aides . and other close allies. Point-by-point, the one minute advert's omissions and deceptions: . Dispute: Romney's experience at Bain Capital has been a source of exhaustive attacks by the Obama campaign in an effort to discredit the Republican challenger . The story centers around Mr Soptic, a 62-year-old lifelong Democrat and union supporter, who worked at GST Steel in Kansas City for more than 20 years. He has come forward as a political partisan and the Obama campaign has tried to make him the face of the white working-class Midwesterner who was a victim of Romney's 'vulture capitalism.' This is the second attack ad against Bain that has given Mr Soptic a starring role. He was first seen in a video about the closure of his steel plant that was released in May. However brutal Mr Soptic's claims are, the facts tell a different story. Romney did not close the steel mill . Mr Soptic, though, blames the plant closure directly on the presumptive Republican nominee. 'I don't think Mitt Romney knows what he . has done to people's lives by closing the plant. I don't think he . realizes that people's lives have completely changed,' he says in the . ad. In 1999, Romney left Bain Capital to run the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. He was no longer at the company when GS Industries went bankrupt in 2001 in the face of mounting losses. He formally left Bain for good in 2002. When Mrs Soptic died in 2006, Romney was governor of Massachusetts and hadn't been in charge of Bain for seven years. Bain Capital's investment did not shut down GST Steel . 'Mitt Romney and Bain Capital made millions for themselves and then closed this steel plant,' a dramatic headline in the ad reads. The real story is much more complex. Bain Capital was one of several investors that paid $80million to buy the plant from Armco in 1993. At the time it was struggling. Armco lost $640million that year. The American steel industry was in the midst of massive shutdowns and struggles as they lost ground to cheaper foreign imports, the Wall Street Journal reports. Bain folded the Kansas City plant, GST Steel, into a company called GS Industries, which made $1billion in revenues by 1996. Controversy: Many of the campaign volleys have centered around whether Bain created more jobs than it destroyed . GST Steel in Kansas City closed, laying off 750 workers including Mr Soptic. It was the only plant in GS Industries that was forced to shut down as a result of the bankruptcy reorganization, the Journal reports. Mrs Soptic did not lose her healthcare because her husband lost his job . 'When Mitt Romney and Bain closed the plant, I lost my healthcare. And my family lost their healthcare,' Mr Soptic states in the video. But that's not true, he admits. At the time he lost his job, Mr Soptic was earning about $41,000 a year. Mrs Soptic also had a job working at a local thrift store that gave her health insurance, CNN reports. She kept the job, and the health benefits, until she was forced to quit in 2003 after an injury. Mrs Soptic died five years after the plant shut down . Here's how the ad plays the timeline: Mr Soptic describes losing his health insurance as a result of the plant closure. 'A short time after that, my wife became ill,' he says. However, it was not until 2006 -- five years after the plant closed -- that this happened, Mr Soptic has admitted. 'I . don’t know how long she was sick, and I think maybe she didn’t say . anything because she knew that we couldn’t afford the insurance,' he . says in the ad. Symbol: Joe Soptic has become the face of the Midwestern working-class 'victim' of Bain Capital -- but his story isn't what it seems . The cancer was stage four by the time she went to the hospital. She died 22 days later. Nonetheless, Mr Soptic still manages to blame Romney for his wife's death. Mr Soptic ends the ad by saying: 'I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he’s done to anyone, and furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned.' The story doesn't end there for Mr Soptic. The Washington Post reveals that his income is back to $46,000 a year -- the same he was making at the mill -- thanks to his pension from the company and his salary as a janitor. He has also re-married. He and his high school sweetheart wed four years after Mrs Soptic died of cancer. Romney's campaign blasted the new spot as 'discredited, dishonest attacks.' A spokesman says Obama is trying to distract the American people from the sluggish economy and high unemployment rates. The Priorities USA Action PAC, which supports Obama's campaign, has raised $20.7million as of June 30 and spent more than $17million -- all on ads attacking Romney. Restore Our Future, Romney's super PAC run by two former aides, has raised $62million and spent $8.2million opposing Obama so far. It also spent nearly $40million bashing Romney's Republican primary challengers and $14million support the former Massachusetts governor.","Video features steel worker Joe Soptic, who was laid off and lost his health benefits after the company owned by Bain Capital went bankrupt .

'I just don't feel like they're helping me out. So if that means I've got to go it alone under the PUP flag then so be it, I'll just run it alone,' she added, according to Fairfax. Senator Lambie will vote with her conscience on issues affecting Tasmania, veterans and military pay, and wants more support from her party. 'I just don't feel like I'm getting support out of Clive Palmer or the Palmer United Party senators,' Ms Lambie said, adding: 'if that means I've got to go it alone under the PUP flag then so be it' Her comments come only a few days after Mr Palmer publicly slammed her idea to use Remembrance Day as an event to protest the wages of Defence Force members. While Ms Lambie called on Australians and war veterans to turn their backs on government members during their speeches on the day, Mr Palmer dismissed her call-out over Twitter. 'All Australians, particularly politicians, should show the utmost respect on Remembrance Day. It is never a day for political actions,' he wrote. Senator Lambie also warned that unless her colleagues started using their consciences a bit more, PUP might start losing its bearings. Earlier in the week, while Ms Lambie called on Australians and war veterans to turn their backs on government members during their speeches on Remembrance Day, Mr Palmer slammed her call-out over Twitter . 'If the party is going to survive then they better come up with a bloody better plan of attack than they've been using,' she said. 'One thing I won't do is, I won't lie to the Australian people and I'm not going to sit here and make my PUP senators and Clive Palmer look good when I'm not feeling that way about them. I won't do that.' Former PUP insiders also told the ABC they resigned in frustration because party members were not going to be really allowed to organise or participate in policy formulation and debate.","Senator Lambie is refusing to pass any government legislation even if it has the support of her party .

"Supermarkets were facing a backlash last night after claiming that it was ‘unnecessary’ to spell out on labels whether meat comes from animals killed by religious slaughter. Religious groups from all faiths, vets and animal welfare groups joined calls for new labels to identify halal or kosher meat. But retailers claimed that shoppers do not care – and even argued that there is not enough room on packs for new labels. Production line: Chickens after ritual slaughter in a halal abattoir in Burgundy, France. Supermarkets were facing a backlash last night after claiming it was 'unnecessary' to spell out on labels whether meat comes from animals killed by religious slaughter . Tory MPs have tabled an amendment to the Consumer Rights Bill, which is to be debated next week, that would require a move to clearer labels. However, the idea is opposed by most retailers and David Cameron, the Prime Minister, believes that there is no need to change the law. Demands for more informative labels follow widespread outrage over the disclosure in yesterday’s Daily Mail that millions of people are being sold halal and kosher meat without being told. All the major supermarkets are selling New Zealand lamb killed according to halal ritual without providing labels. Separately, many restaurants such as Pizza Express, KFC and Subway are selling halal meat – mainly chicken – without printing the information on menus. Both halal and kosher slaughter involve a religious ritual in which the throat is cut. But some animals are not stunned beforehand, leaving them in pain. The Conservative MP Philip Davies, who is leading calls for a new labelling law, said: ‘There is overwhelming public support for this change. People should be able to make an informed choice about what they are buying.’ Mr Davies has the support of a large number of Tory MPs, while the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, said that consumers should be given more information. Asda has confirmed it stocks some branded halal and kosher meat . However, Mr Cameron last night ruled out the need for a new national labelling system, insisting that it was up to the food industry to act if consumers demanded more transparency. ‘I would hope it will be dealt with by restaurants and businesses,’ he told ITV West Country. ‘We should start from the approach that the greater the transparency the better and I think we can achieve this without necessarily having a full-on national labelling scheme.’ The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which speaks for most supermarkets, responded to the criticism by saying a change to labels is unnecessary. Andrew Opie, the food director at the BRC, said: ‘We have not seen evidence that this is what people want to see. Labels are very tight in terms of the space and what we can put on them. This has to be driven by evidence to show that people want to see it alongside the things that are already on it like durability, country of origin and price.’ By contrast, Morrisons, Waitrose and the Co-op broke ranks to say that it is time for the Government to take a lead to develop clear and consistent guidance for the food industry. The desire for improved labels is supported by groups from all religious faiths. A joint statement by the Muslim Council of Britain and Shechita UK, which oversees kosher slaughter, said: ‘Comprehensive labelling should be supported by faith communities and animal welfare groups alike.’","A Consumer Rights Bill amendment will be debated next week .

"When Molly Askham was just ten weeks old, her parents noticed that one side of her head was much flatter than the other. Doctors diagnosed her with a severe skull deformity called plagiocephaly or ‘flat head syndrome’ – but told Michelle and Peter Askham that treatment wasn’t available on the NHS. Desperate to make their little girl better, Mr and Mrs Askham were forced to take out a payday loan to fund private care. Molly Askham (pictured with mother, Michelle) developed 'flat head syndrome' as a newborn baby which meant that her skull became misshapen . Plagiocephaly affects the soft skulls of newborn babies, and in Molly’s . case was so extreme that one ear appeared to have moved towards the back . of her head. Doctors told Mrs Askham, 27, and her 32-year-old husband . that the problem should cure itself – but instead it got worse. Molly's condition was so extreme that one ear appeared to have moved to the back of her head . The couple contacted a private clinic which uses a specially designed . helmet to reshape the head, but the treatment cost £2,000 and a £500 . deposit was required before it could begin. With no savings to fall back on, the couple searched for moneylenders on . the internet. They took out a high-interest £200 ‘payday loan’ and . another expensive £200 ‘doorstep loan’. The family held fundraising . events to obtain the rest of the money, and eventually Molly was given . her helmet. It works by holding the normal side  of the head in position . while providing a ‘gap’ for the flattened side to grow into. After wearing it 23 hours a day for four months, her head is a normal shape again – but her parents are still in debt. Mrs Askham, whose husband has a low-paid job with a welding company, . said they were making regular repayments to the doorstep lender and had . had to borrow money from her parents to repay the other cash loan, which . had already doubled. She needed a £2,000 specially designed helmet to reshape her head but the NHS would not pay for the treatment as they considered it to be 'cosmetic' and doctors believed that it would correct itself . Molly's worried parents had to turn to payday and doorstep loans to fund her treatment and after she had been wearing the helmet for just 17 weeks she had recovered sufficiently that she no longer required it . The mother of two said she was ‘shocked and angry’ to discover the . treatment for such a severe form of plagiocephaly was not available on . the NHS because it was regarded as ‘cosmetic’ – even though breast . enlargement surgery and tattoo removals were sometimes provided. Mrs . Askham, from Leeds, said: ‘Funding should be available for a deformity . as bad as this. ‘It’s horrible to think of your child as being deformed, but that’s what . it is. 'Her ear was not where it was meant to be and her nose was moving . as well.' These helmets do work and worked very well for Molly. ‘But it was very frightening and it seemed as if her skin was moving. She was a little girl and one ear was in a strange place.’ Molly’s head was normal when she was born five weeks prematurely last . August at St James’s Hospital in Leeds, weighing 4lb 14oz. She spent two periods in hospital during the early weeks of her life . because she developed an intolerance to cow’s milk and had meningitis. By the age of ten weeks it was ‘very noticeable’ that one side of . Molly’s head had become flat. The local NHS Airedale, Bradford and Leeds Primary Care Trust was . recently disbanded, but in an earlier statement on the case said: ‘The . NHS does not usually fund the use of cranial remoulding orthosis for . babies with plagiocephaly. ‘This is a largely cosmetic issue and in the majority of cases the . condition will resolve spontaneously with advice around positioning of . the baby.’ Molly's head was normal when she was born five weeks prematurely last August at St James' Hospital in Leeds, weighing 4lb 14oz . She spent her first few weeks in and out of hospital because she developed meningitis but she is now a healthy baby. Her parents are continuing to pay off the loans .","Molly Askham had 'flat head syndrome' and her skull appeared misshapen .

"London's drugs gangs are expanding their operations into the Home Counties and fuelling a rise in violence previously seen only in the capital, experts warn. Simon Harding, a criminologist at Middlesex University, said gangsters were recruiting teenage girls and boys to create crack and heroin supply lines to towns including Cambridge, Scarborough and Derby. And when two gangs decide to set up shop in the same small town it was leading to an escalation of violence as dealers fight for control of the new territory, he said. Crack cocaine and cash: London gangs are exploiting youngsters to expand operations to the Home Counties, a move which has led to a rise in violent and acquisitive crime previously typical to the capital. File picture . The warning comes after a series of raids in September targeting a criminal network allegedly trafficking boys and girls to rural parishes and towns in Kent and Hampshire to ferry drugs. Around 250 officers swooped on eight members of a Lewisham gang suspected of recruiting children as young as 14 directly from south London schools and youth clubs. Canterbury, Aylesham, Folkestone, and Portsmouth were among the areas where raids took place. Scotland Yard identified more than 250 gangs operating in the capital last year, which has been cut by a third, with nearly 900 members jailed and another 200 subject to other measures including antisocial behaviour orders. Although many of London’s gangs are territorial, based on postcodes and estates, the crackdown led to a spike in offences being committed outside the capital as groups spread into new potentially lucrative areas. Dr Harding told The Times children are finding themselves in a 'Dickensian world' where gangs sent girls to scope out rural areas before sending boys to set up drugs supply lines with an established contact. 'Gangs can even put a deposit down on a flat in these small towns so these teenagers live and operate out of them,' he said. 'When you have two gangs deciding to operate in the same area, you will start to see an escalation of violence.' Junior Smart, an ex-offender turned gang expert with the St Giles Trust, said previously localised London gangs were expanding to 'any town you can think of'. A criminologist said gangsters were recruiting teenage girls and boys to create crack and heroin supply lines to towns including Cambridge (pictured), Scarborough and Derby . He said: 'The first sign a drugs line has been embedded is the rise in acquisitive crime such as theft, shoplifting and burglary. 'This is often done by those buying the drugs and needing cash to feed the habit.' In the six months up to September, 15 boys and girls aged between 15 and 20 were arrested in Kent and Hampshire carrying up to 200 rocks of crack cocaine or large amounts of heroin. Many had been forced to stash the drugs under their clothes as they travelled by train from the gang’s south-east London stronghold to a series of rented houses where they deal on the streets. Detective Superintendent Tim Champion, of Trident central gangs unit, told the Evening Standard at the time of the raids the gang had 'evolved' to use children. 'The controllers of the network stay in London most of the time and use the young people to take all the risks involved in drug dealing,' he said. ‘It means all the points where they could be intercepted with drugs is taken by these young people. Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Dennis from Hampshire Constabulary added: ‘We identified that drug gangs from London were sending young people into Portsmouth to deal. 'These young people are themselves victims and we have taken steps to safeguard them and to work with them.’","Criminologist warns young boys and girls are being recruited by the gangs .

"Britons are burning themselves out by not getting enough 'me time', suggests a new study. Researchers found nearly two-thirds of adults (61 per cent) aren't getting enough 'down-time' a week - leading to stress, tiredness and even depression. For the study involving 2,000 adults, 'me time' was defined as taking time-out for yourself. Scroll down for video . Psychologist Linda Papadopoulos, pictured, said it was important to remember we are 'human beings not human doings' and it is nceessary to take time out to watch a movie or read a book to re energise . The findings from the study, commissioned by relationship website eHarmony, show that despite needing around 20 hours of mental down-time a week to feel relaxed and refreshed, less than two in five Britons (39 per cent) are meeting the requirement. Among those who said they don't have enough me time, more than a third (36 per cent) felt more tired, while others felt more stressed (33 per cent), burnt out (22 per cent), and even depressed (14 per cent). One in 25 (four per cent) even said they feel less attractive. More than one in seven people (15 per cent) say they have no me time at all, while one in nine (11 per cent) have less than five hours a week. Longer working hours is one of the biggest drains on taking time out, with 42 per cent saying their job gets in the way of their relaxation, rising to 57 per cent among those aged 45 to 54. For younger adults, browsing social media sites has a big impact, with 10 per cent citing 'FOMO' - fear of missing out - as a real issue. Other time drains include household chores (41 per cent), personal admin (21 per cent) and thinking about work (18 per cent), while even optional activities, such as group hobbies (14 per cent), can have a negative impact. 1.

Psychologist Doctor Linda Papadopoulos, who assisted with the study, said 'It's important to remember that we're human-beings, not human-doings, and finding the time to simply indulge yourself, whether that be watching a movie, reading a book or even taking a nap, is really important to distress and energise. 'Everyone is different, but typically around 20 hours of me time each week is a good amount to help feel in control of life and evaluate your goals. 'Some people may spread this out over the week, while others in highly-pressured jobs may 'binge' on down time at the weekend to catch up after a busy week.' People living in the North East get the most Me Time a week (28 hours) - 10 hours more than the Welsh who have the least (18 hours), according to the research. Those aged 25 to 34 have the least amount of time to themselves (13 hours per week), eight hours less than the national average of 21 hours. Given more me time a week, people would indulge in their favorite hobbies and interests including reading (44 per cent), listen to more music (31 per cent), watch quality TV (30 per cent), go for more walks or simply just catch up on sleep (both 29 per cent). Researchers found that workers are becoming increasingly stressed due to time shortages, file photo . Jemima Wade, of eHarmony, said: 'The findings show that taking some time out for yourself is a necessity these days, not a luxury. 'Busy lives can mean we forget to step back and give ourselves space to relax or take a minute to do the little things that make us happy. 'With that in mind, eHarmony is launching 'Love Sundays' - a project encouraging singles to do something that makes them feel good every Sunday - be it trying out a new recipe at home, curling up on the couch with a good book or just taking 10 minutes out to sit and relax, or maybe even chat to a new match.'","TV psychologist Linda Papadopoulos warned about the need to relax .

"Philip Hammond has questioned David Cameron’s desire to enshrine in law a pledge to spend billions of pounds in foreign aid. Speaking on a trip to ebola-stricken Sierra Leone, the Foreign Secretary said yesterday he saw no reason to pass a law that says 0.7 per cent of Britain’s national income has to go on aid ‘because we have met it already’. His remarks appear to be the final nail in the coffin for Mr Cameron’s vow to put the commitment on the statute in this Parliament. Scroll down for video . Philip Hammond has questioned David Cameron’s desire to enshrine in law a pledge to spend billions of pounds in foreign aid . Such legislation was part of the Coalition agreement, but has repeatedly been put off. Mr Hammond said: ‘It’s a bizarre idea. Somebody says “shall we have a law that says you’ve got to build a building?” ‘Think about it – in the meantime we build a building. Someone comes along and says “now we’ve built it shall we pass the law which says we’ve got to do it”? We’ve done it. We’re doing it. You don’t need a law to say we’re doing it.’ Mr Hammond said the work the UK was doing to prevent the spread of ebola in West Africa proved why international aid was so important and how it is in the UK’s best interests to spend so much money on it. But he conceded that much of the public was ‘sceptical’ about the value of aid – especially when it was spent on long-term economic and education programmes in countries such as India which could afford a space programme. Mr Hammond's remarks appear to be the final nail in the coffin for Mr Cameron’s vow to put the commitment on the statute in this Parliament . And he admitted millions of pounds handed out by the Department for International Development are wasted every year because of corruption in recipient countries. Mr Hammond was speaking on a visit to Sierra Leone, one of the three West African countries where ebola has taken hold. He visited a medical centre being built with UK aid money at Port Loko in the west of the country. And, on a visit to the national stadium in the capital, Freetown, he saw people from Sierra Leone being taught how to treat ebola sufferers. Britain has pledged £230million to Sierra Leone to help it tackle ebola, and more than 800 troops are stationed there. So far, 5,224 cases of ebola have been reported in the country, with 1,498 deaths. Mr Hammond said he hoped trials of an anti-ebola vaccine could start by early next month. The Foreign Secretary said of the ebola effort: ‘This is a classic example of how our aid spending is deployed in our own interest. ‘First – getting this epidemic under control in West Africa is in our interests. ‘We’ve got significant economic interests in West Africa, we’ve got significant numbers of people travelling between West Africa and the UK, we’ve got significant numbers of British citizens and residents with connections in West Africa – so from purely a self-interest point of view we need to sort this out. ‘But it’s also clear that if it had just been left, we would have had a million, million and a half cases by early next year – and inevitably the larger the pool or cases, the greater the number that will turn up in Western Europe, North America, so the risk of infection spreading. It’s very much in our interest.’ But he admitted there was ‘scepticism’ among the British public about the value of much of our aid – and that there were ‘ongoing challenges’ in persuading people much of it does good. ‘The scepticism that some people will have about the aid budget, which I absolutely recognise, I don’t think has ever been directed at emergency aid,’ he said. ‘I’ve never detected in Britain people saying we shouldn’t be sending food aid, or disaster relief or earthquake relief. Mr Hammond said that, for this reason, the UK had made disaster relief the top priority, and would cut other forms of aid if need be. He also admitted that a lot of British aid money was ‘siphoned’ off thanks to corruption. He said: ‘In countries that are corrupt, and that’s a lot of countries including some of the poorest countries in the world, some of everything gets siphoned off in corruption and the aid budget isn’t excepted. ‘If you’re doing any kind of business, including aid-related business, in countries like many African countries and countries like Afghanistan, inevitably because the system is so corrupt, some of it going to get caught up in that. ‘Part of what we’re trying to do is deal with endemic corruption.’","Foreign Secretary said he saw no reason for law that says 0.7 per cent of Britain’s national income has to go on aid ‘because we have met it already’

"Ringleader: Masoud Rasab (pictured), 38, is said to have organised the four sham marriages in the case . A fake bride was caught with 'crib sheets' listing her husband's height, weight, shoe size, how they met and how often they had sex, a court heard. The claim was revealed today as seven men and women stood trial over an alleged plot to gain visas for four Pakistani men - by pairing them off with British brides. The women were allegedly paid up to £7,000 each to take part in bogus ceremonies in Nottingham, Leicester and Hertfordshire arranged by 38-year-old Masoud Rasab. A trial at Sheffield Crown Court - where Rasab is in the dock with three 'brides', two 'grooms' and an alleged accessory to the plot - heard the unions were 'less about passion and more about profit'. Rasab, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is said to have run a bride delivery service for almost four years until  July last year, helping the four desperate men stay in Britain. Jurors heard that when one bride tried to pull out, vile threats were made against her and her children. Another was paid £7,000, then lived 150 miles from her husband and claimed unemployment benefits as a single woman. A third had to text her husband to find out 'their' address, the court heard. And when officers went to the home of the fourth alleged bride, 21-year-old Alisha Mahmood, they found so-called crib sheets on her husband Muhammad Ishaque, who is not on trial. Despite the couple marrying in June 2012, the alleged notes detailed the colour of Mr Ishaque's walls and carpets. Prosecutor Christopher Smith added: 'It gave his height, weight, shoe size, details of the early stages of their relationship and the frequency of their love-making.' Mr Ishaque had been in Britain on a student visa since 2006, but  the wedding at Nottingham Register Office was reported to the Home Office after the registrar noted there was 'little interaction' between the pair . Before the ceremony Mahmood, from Rotherham, was allegedly a scout for other sham brides - and was paid a £250 'commission' for each one she found. One of those was Keeley Cox, who has already pleaded guilty to conspiring to breach immigration law after marrying Yasir Awan, who is on trial. The court heard she was recruited for the 2012 ceremony at Nottingham Register Office after Rasab, Mahmood and two other men turned up at her house and offered her money. Brides: Sabrina Khan (left) allegedly received more than £2,000 while Tracey Caulstock (right) received £7,000 . She tried to pull out - but she and her children were then threatened, jurors heard. Prosecutor Mr Smith told the court: 'This is a case about sham marriages. 'You will hear about four weddings, and how they were built not on love, mutual respect and companionship, but a combination of greed and dishonesty.' Mr Smith said UK immigration laws allow foreign nationals who fall in love with a British citizen to apply to stay in the country. 'There are those desperate to stay in this country that are prepared to exploit that weakness,' he said. 'Money can buy you a British bride and so, through her, buy you the means to deceive the authorities into giving you a right to stay as her spouse. 'The four women in this case were prepared - for the promise of money - to marry men they didn't know. 'Their marriages were less about passion and more about profit.' Mr Smith said the first wedding was between Gul Khatab, 35, a Pakistani national who lived in Sheffield on a student visa, and Tracey Coulstock, 48, of Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Accused: Tahir Siddique (left) is accused of allowing his bank account to be used; Umair Hussain (right) was an alleged groom after wanting to remain in Britain when his five-year-old student visa expired in 2011 . The couple married at Hatfield Register Office in January 2010, and two months later Khatab applied to the Home Office for indefinite leave to remain in Britain. But instead of living in Hatfield with his new wife, Khatab lived and worked 150 miles away in Sheffield, the court heard. His wife, a security guard, was reportedly paid £7,000 for her trouble. Mr Smith asked jurors: 'Was it a mere act of generosity by a lovestruck new husband or was it part of as concerted effort to leave his name on official paperwork to prove that the couple lived together?' The second wedding was between Sabrina Khan,  29, from Rotherham, and Umair Hussain, 28, from Sheffield. Six weeks before his five-year-old student visa was due to expire in December 2011, Hussain gave notice of his intention to marry Khan at Leicester Register Office. Investigators later found a 'fistful' of receipts under a mattress at his home showing he had paid just under £2,000 into Khan's bank account. 'It might be called proof of purchase,' said Mr Smith. Mr Smith said although Khan was 'married', she claimed benefits as a single woman. Text messages found on her phone indicated an 'intimate' relationship with another man within five months of the wedding - and she had to ask where her husband lived. A text from her phone to his read: 'Can you text your address? I need to change my address details to your details.' Rasab,  Hussain,  Khan,  Mahmood,  Khatab and  Coulstock all deny conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration law. Tahir Siddique, 41, of Tinsley, South Yorkshire, is accused of allowing his address to be used as part of the scam. He denies the same charge. The trial continues.

"As Australia's highest paid bank boss announced her retirement at the age of 58 after seven years at the helm of Westpac, there was one man she wanted to thank above all the others. Chief executive Gail Kelly, who has helped Westpac doubled its profits while she’s been in charge, said she ‘would like to thank one special person and that’s my husband Allan’. The South African-born Australian businesswoman met Allan Kelly while at university in Cape Town. After they married she began working as a teacher and he as a social worker before she switched to banking and he went into medicine. They had four children together, including triplets, and came across to Australia in the late 1990’s, eventually becoming Australian citizens in 2001. ‘We’ve been married 37 years and we’ve been in this journey of life together,’ she said during a press conference at Westpac’s head office in Sydney’s CBD. Scroll down for video . Chief executive Gail Kelly has announced her retirement at the age of 58 . ‘He’s encouraged me to be bold, to back myself, he’s encourage me to be the very best I can be. There’s no way I could do what I do without him and his wonderful support,’ Mrs Kelly gushed. She announced she will be replaced by Westpac's Australian financial services chief executive Brian Hartzer from February 1, 2015, when she retires from her executive role. However, she said that despite retiring from Westpac she will continue to work on her other passions and charity work. ‘I don’t think these days people retire fully, if you think I’m going to put my feet up at home that’s not what I mean,’ she said. ‘I am full of energy, I love my life, I love what I do and the things I hope I can make a contribution to into the future,’ she explained as she listed the roles she will continue at the US Foreign Relations Council and the humanitarian charity CARE Australia. ‘I’m an ambassador for CARE Australia, they do amazing work for women and children in emerging markets,’ she said. Mrs Kelly has been called 'one of Australia's most successful CEO's' Mrs Kelly's huge $12.8 million earnings a year were revealed in the bank's annual report on Wednesday. Her fixed pay is $3 million a year but she pocketed an extra $7 million in performance shares and a short-term cash incentive of $2.74 million. Chairman of Westpac Lindsay Maxstead said: 'On behalf of the Board I want to thank and acknowledge Gail's leadership and outstanding contribution to Westpac. 'Gail is one of Australia's most successful CEOs... During her tenure the value of the company has more than doubled, with market capitalisation increasing from just under $50 billion to around $104 billion. 'Gail drove the successful merger with St. George, which saw the Group strengthen its position in retail banking and in wealth.' Brian Hartzer (left) will become Westpac's CEO from February 1, 2015. Westpac's market capitalisation increased from just under $50 billion to around $104 billion under Mrs Kelly . Mr Maxstead also congratulated Gail on the way she has nurtured talent in the corporation. 'She has personally driven the growth of women in senior executive roles, mature aged workers and those who work part-time,' he said. Her replacement, Mr Hartzer, has more than 25 years' experience in financial services. Before joining Westpac in 2012, he was Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Chief Executive Officer UK Retail, Wealth and Ulster Bank. He has also worked as a senior executive at ANZ. On Wednesday, the day before her retirement announcement, Mrs Kelly also made a statement on climate change. 'There is little doubt that climate change is one of the defining issues of our time,' she said. 'The science is telling is that in our lifetime we are going to face sweeping climatic changes with environmental, economic, health and social impacts that will change the way we live our lives,' she added. Mrs Kelly warned that 'there is still along way to go' at Westpac as they reduce their own carbon footprint and try increase awareness and understanding.","Gail Kelly will be replaces as Westpac CEO by Brian Hartzer .

"The end of the world is not nigh. Life will thrive on Earth for at least another 1.75billion years and perhaps as many as 3.5billion. Beyond then, the Sun will have become so hot that nothing will be able to survive, scientists believe. Ever since it was formed our planet has been at just the right distance from the Sun to make it habitable. Armageddon: The Sun will eventually become so hot that no life on earth will survive, scientists believe . Being in this ‘Goldilocks’ zone has allowed oceans to develop in temperatures neither too hot to boil the water away, or too cold to freeze it into permanent ice. The problem is, however, that stars become hotter over time, ensuring that the habitable period cannot last. As the stars emit more heat, any surface water on nearby planets dries up and without water nothing can survive. At this point, the Earth will have ‘moved’ out of the habitable zone even though its position will be exactly the same. The prediction comes from experts at the University of East Anglia, who believe the world can expect between 6.3billion and 7.8billion years of ‘Goldilocks’ conditions from its birth around 4.55billion years ago. That means there can only be 1.75billion to 3.5billion years of life left. Andrew Rushby, a researcher at the university, said: ‘After this point, the Earth would be in the hot zone of the Sun, with temperatures so high that the seas would evaporate. 'Goldilocks': The Earth, bottom right, is currently the perfect distance from the Sun, left, to support life . ‘We would see a catastrophic and terminal extinction event for all life.’ Humans would be among the first species to be wiped out – and well before even the 1.75billion-year timescale. ‘Humans would be in trouble with even a small increase in temperature and near the end only microbes in niche environments would be able to endure the heat,’ said Mr Rushby. The research project also examined the prospects of finding life on other planets with a long habitable lifetime. Mr Rushby examined seven candidates – the most likely being a planet known as Gliese 581d, which Mr Rushby estimates will have the right temperature for life for up to 55billion years. Dry end: If the prediction from University of East Anglia researchers come true, all the water on Earth will eventually evaporate . Roughly twice as big as the Earth, Gliese 581d is a daunting 20 light years way. Mr Rushby added: ‘It is possible that there will be a habitable Earth-like planet within ten light years, which is very close in astronomical terms. ‘However, reaching it would take hundreds of thousands of years with our current technology. If we ever needed to move to another planet, Mars is probably our best bet. ‘It’s very close and will remain in the habitable zone until the end of the Sun’s lifetime – six billion years from now.’ The team’s calculations for the Earth’s lifespan are based on the rate at which the Sun is warming up. The larger figure, 3.5billion years, adjusts for atmospheric changes. The institution behind the end-of-the-world calculation was at the heart of the Climategate scandal of 2009. Emails leaked from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit showed scientists plotting how to avoid freedom of information requests and appeared to show them discussing how to manipulate data. Some of the most controversial emails contained personal attacks on climate change sceptics and one, by the unit’s Professor Phil Jones, mentioned using a ‘trick’ to massage years of temperature data to ‘hide the decline’. The researchers were later cleared of any wrongdoing but the university was criticised for having an ‘unacceptable’ culture of secrecy. The unit looks at how multiple factors, from volcanic eruptions to greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere, affect the temperature of the planet. It works on timescales as short as days and weeks. The Earth’s projected lifespan came from a separate department at the UEA’s School of Environmental Sciences: the Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences. Its timescale covered many hundreds of millions of years.","University of East Anglia scientists predict the Sun will wipe out all life on the planet .

"A mother has spoken of the helplessness and pain she felt watching her 10-year-old daughter's struggle with anorexia after school bullies called her fat. Maxine Moss, 34, watched in horror as Jade's weight plummeted to a just 2st 13lbs - the same as an average four-year-old. Despite the warning signs, doctors labelled Jade, now 12, a 'picky eater'. Ms Moss, of Cannock, Staffordshire, said: 'I knew the signs because I'd suffered from anorexia as a child. I begged the doctors for help, but they maintained that Jade was too young to have an eating disorder. Helpless: Maxine Moss, 34, watched in horror as Jade's weight plummeted to a just 2st 13lbs - the same as an average four-year-old, after suffering from anorexia brought on by cruel taunts from classmates . The youngster's problems began in June 2012, after school bullies branded her 'fat' and 'ugly'. Upset, Jade began to feel body conscious and started to restrict her diet, secretly throwing food away. The mother-of-ten noticed her daughter's lack of appetite and spoke to Jade, who confided about her troubles at school. Ms Moss complained to teachers, who reprimanded the bullies with a verbal warning. She said: 'I told Jade not to listen to the bullies, but it was no use.' Jade continued to restrict her food intake and by September 2012, Maxine was forced to take her to the GP. Jade said: 'I knew I was getting skinny, but no matter how small I got, I still believed I was fat' But the doctor suggested Jade's lack of appetite was due to her being a 'picky eater'. A week later, she noticed Jade checking the calorie content on food packaging. Jade said: 'I knew I was getting skinny, but no matter how small I got, I still believed I was fat. 'When I brushed my hair, clumps would fall on to the carpet, and my skin was becoming flaky too.' Jade then started skipping dinner, claiming she'd already eaten at a friend's house. Ms Moss said: 'Jade now weighs a healthy five stone, but she missed months of school, and it's been difficult to catch up' At school, she was secretly throwing her lunch away, surviving on just a nibble of a biscuit. Ms Moss said: 'Even treats wouldn't tempt her. 'While her brothers and sisters ate chocolate cake for dessert, Jade would only manage an ice lolly. 'With nine children at home, it was tough to keep track of Jade's eating habits. 'I couldn't force her to eat and the doctors would do nothing. I felt helpless.' By October 2012, Jade's weight had dropped from 4st 7lbs to less than 3st, leaving her severely dehydrated and suffering liver and kidney failure. She struggled to walk, her face was gaunt and her clothes hung limply from her frail body. Her breathing was shallow and she felt faint all the time. Shockingly, Maxine could feel Jade's bones after checking her chest when she complained of pains. It was the last straw and the youngster was admitted to Stafford Hospital, where she was diagnosed with anorexia. With a BMI of just 9, Jade was dangerously underweight. She was assigned a dietician, who encouraged her to eat small mouthfuls of food. But after ten days of refusing to eat, Jade was still severely dehydrated and her organs were failing, so she was fed through a tube. Jade said: 'The doctors told mum that I was in danger of dying if I didn't eat something.' While ex-husband Graham, 41, looked after Jade's brothers and sisters, Thomas, 18, Callum, 13, Graham, 11, Calvin, 7, Ellie-Mae, 6, Summer, 4, Ocean, 3, Alex, 2, Maxine stayed by Jade's bedside. Ms Moss begged Jade to eat and even sneaked in Jade's favourite takeaway, crispy chicken and egg fried rice to encourage her. After 11 weeks, Jade started to eat small meals. Getting better: Jade with her friend Billy about to attend her school prom a couple of months after her feeding tube was removed . 'The first time she swallowed a piece of crispy chicken I wanted to cry - there was a chance my little girl would make it, she said' Jade's appetite slowly began to improve and she returned home in December 2012 weighing 3st 7lbs. For the next six months, she received home visits from nurses, who checked her weight and progress, as well as counselling sessions, which she continues to receive to this day. In January 2013 - seven months after she dropped out - Jade went back to school, but, too weak to walk, she relied on a wheelchair to get around. She could only manage small meals, so relied on her feeding tube and protein shakes for nutrition. Finally, in February 2013, Jade's feeding tube was removed. Ms Moss said: 'Jade now weighs a healthy five stone, but she missed months of school, and it's been difficult to catch up. 'It's taken us a year and a half to get here, but I'm so pleased to see my little girl smile again. 'I want other mums to know that no matter how young the child, an eating disorder can still take hold, even if they don't fully understand it themselves.'","Maxine Moss forced to watch her daughter Jade waste away .

"The Boston bombing survivor who had her leg amputated on Monday has spoken out about her excitement at starting a new life - as she vowed to run the marathon one day. Rebekah DiMartino, 27, had her left leg amputated below the knee at a hospital near Houston, Texas on Monday after doctors struggled for 18 months to save it. But after undergoing 17 operations and suffering debilitating pain since the April 2013 bombings, having the leg amputated was an easy decision for DiMartino to make. 'I have said all along that my leg is just my leg and my life is so much more,' she told the Today show on Wednesday. Scroll down for video .

'I am thrilled because I am moving on with my life. I am taking away the old and bringing in the new and I just can't wait to see what it brings.' Part of that future will include running the Boston Marathon, she said. 'It's one of my biggest goals,' she said. 'I will run the Boston Marathon, definitely.' Before she lost the limb on Monday, DiMartino tickled her supporters by posting a break-up letter to the leg on Facebook, hosting a 'left leg last supper' and writing, 'It's not you, it's me' across her shin. Recovering: After the surgery, DiMartino posed with her son for a selfie and shared an image of her leg . Still smiling: DiMartino, pictured with her husband Pete (right) and other family members before her surgery . 'I've had a lot of fun with it,' she told the Today show. 'Everybody looks at it as such a sad thing, but it's really not, it's my new beginning... I feel better than I have in 18 months.' She will now beginning physical therapy and will eventually be fitted for a prosthetic. Her husband Pete, who was at the marathon with DiMartino and her seven-year-old son Noah, said that he has no doubt that his wife with master the new limb. 'She is very stubborn, which is not really a bad thing because she will be told she can't do something and she just tries to do it anyway,' he told KHOU. She told the channel she is also determine to recover so that the brothers who inflicted horror and pain on the city of Boston last year do not win. Injuries: Ahead of the surgery, she shared this image, left, showing her saying goodbye to the leg. Since the bombing, she has undergone 17 operations, including having pins put in her leg, right . Saying goodbye: She posted this farewell note to her left leg on her Facebook page on Sunday . DiMartino was with her son and Pete, who was then just her boyfriend, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when the two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring 270. All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg. In a bid to save the limb, she underwent 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, but she also suffered a serious bone infection. Although she was confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time after the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year. Still, even a boot did not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'. Staying strong: The couple are pictured together before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch before a Red Sox game at Fenway Park in May. She has spent much time in a wheelchair or on bedrest . Excitement: She said that her seven-year-old son Noah, pictured, is excited to have a 'part robot mom' 'There is not an ounce of sadness anywhere in my heart,' she wrote on Facebook after the operation on Monday. 'What has been anticipated and stressed about since April 2013 is over and I am moving on to the next chapter.' After the successful operation, she also shared a selfie of her grinning beside her son Noah. Before the operation, she said that the seven-year-old boy had long been upset about her potentially losing her leg, but last week, after asking her a lot of questions about her operation, that changed. She explained: 'With the biggest smile on his face he shouted 'that's so cool! I'm gonna have a part robot mom!'' See below for video .

"Rapper Imir R. Williams - who also goes by the stage name Mirkat – has pleaded guilty to beating a star of the TV series Amish Mafia. Williams admitted on Thursday to assaulting and stalking girlfriend Esther Schmucker, who appears on the Discovery Channel show based in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Authorities say Williams repeatedly punched Schmucker on October 31 at her Strasburg home and broke her nose, cheekbone and several teeth. Imir R. Williams (l) was released on bail on Monday and placed on probation for three years after he admitted to beating and stalking his girlfriend Esther Schmucker, from the TV series Amish Mafia . Violence: Imir R. Williams, 24, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault . Scene: The couple live on this block in Strasburg, Lancaster County, which is close to the set of Amish Mafia. The Intelligencer Journal/Lancaster New Era reports Williams had been jailed for the past seven weeks. He was released on bail on Monday after serving a month more than the standard penalty for such charges. Williams was placed on probation for three years and ordered to have no contact with Schmucker. After attacking girlfriend Esther Schmucker, Imir R. Williams drove her here, to Lancaster Regional Medical Center, to have her injuries treated. When asked by staff what happened, Schmucker told them her wounds were inflicted by a female because Williams was at her side at the time . Schmucker is one of the stars of Discovery series Amish Mafia, which is now in its second series. It is part documentary, part re-enactment drama about the Amish men who protect their clan in Pennsylvania . The 27-year-old victim says she's disappointed Williams wasn't charged with a harsher crime. Williams is not on the program. Schmucker  has previously filed at least three protection-from-abuse orders against Williams. However, she failed to attend any of the court hearings so they were dismissed. The . latest criminal complaint against Williams - who is black, 6-foot-4 and . weighs 210 pounds - stated that he assaulted her between 1 and 2 am . on Halloween at the home he shared with Schmucker. Esther Schmucker has previously filed three protection-from-abuse orders against boyfriend Imir R. Williams . Police . were alerted to the incident by officials at Lancaster Regional Medical . Center after Shmucker arrived for treatment for a broken nose, a facial . fracture and numerous broken teeth. Shmucker . was reluctant to discuss what had happened with the medical staff, . initially saying her attacker was female, according to Lancaster Online. She then went into Strasburg police station and officially reported the assault. Schmucker . told officers she was afraid to tell medical personnel who had beaten . her because Williams stayed with her as she was being treated. Candice . Klase, a roommate of Schmucker, provided a written statement to . police, saying that Williams wouldn't leave Schmucker's side in the . three days following the attack, 'like he was guarding her'. 'She was in fear... to tell the nurse that Williams was the person that did it,' police wrote in a court affidavit. In . the PFA petitions filed this summer, Schmucker maintains Williams . sexually assaulted her, beat her and threatened to kill her several . times. 'He told me he will chop me into pieces and throw me in the garbage can,' she wrote in one petition. 'He told me multiple times that he is going to kill me and that he just has to figure out how to do it,' she also wrote. Police said they are 'very familiar with this couple'.","Esther Schmucker, 27, told police she was 'repeatedly punched' by boyfriend Imir R. Williams, 24 .

"Harold Morgan, 85, is expected to have a send off to remember tomorrow after a social media appeal for mourners to attend his funeral went viral . A Facebook appeal for mourners to attend the funeral of an ex Welsh Guardsman has been so successful there are concerns the venue will prove too small. Harold Morgan, 85, will be remembered at a service in St Tathan Church in St Athan, South Wales, tomorrow. The church had feared they would struggle to fill a single row of pews at Mr Morgan's funeral. Oxford-born Mr Morgan, had lived in a care home in Barry for the past 14 years. The former railwayman died with little known about his family after he spent his final 14 years in a care home in nearby Barry. Officials said it would be 'horrible' if no-one attended his send-off, so the Reverend Rachel Simpson, the curate who will lead the service, posted a message on the church's Facebook page on Monday. It said: 'On Thursday November 13, we have the funeral for the late Harold Morgan at 12 noon. 'He lived in Owain Court before moving to a care home in Barry approximately 14 years ago and requested that his funeral be at our church. 'Unfortunately there's been some difficulty tracing next of kin or knowing who his friends were, or if they're still in St Athan. 'If you did know Harold or have any more information, please get in touch or come along to his funeral on Thursday.' Twenty four hours after Reverend Simpson posted her plea on the social media site the appeal went viral. Up to 200 people are now predicted to attend Mr Morgan's funeral - and the only worry now is where to put them all. The service will have a battalion bugler play the Last Post , while two standard bearers will display regimental flags and around 20 veteran and serving Welsh Guardsman will turn out in full uniform to pay their respects. Welsh Railway Research Circle enthusiasts, of which Mr Morgan was a founding member, are also planning to attend the farewell service. Ken Ball, director of the Park Funeral Directors, said: 'Nobody wanted to see an empty church for the service of a man who had done a lot in his life. 'There was a worry that there would be row after row of empty pews with not enough people even to fill the first line. Harold Morgan, 85, will be remembered at a service in St Tathan Church in St Athan (pictured) tomorrow . 'But once the appeal appeared on Facebook all that changed. I know there's a bus load of Welsh Guardsman coming for the service and many people have been in touch. 'The phone has been red hot and from what I understand there could be around 200 people attending tomorrow. 'It could well be there will be more outside the church than in it.' Colonel Tom Bonas, Regimental Adjutant for 1st Welsh Guards, said: 'There will be 10 to 15 people from the Welsh Guards Association attending the service and up to seven from the battalion. 'This has only cropped up in the last 24 hours so we've not been able to trace his service record yet. 'I understand Mr Morgan did his national service with the Welsh Guards in the 1940s in Egypt.' He added: 'We pride ourselves on being a family regiment. We also have a very strong association. Once you don the uniform you become part of that family.' Others will be attending the service out of a sense of duty towards a former soldier. Similar social media campaigns to find mourners for forces veterans have also produced results in recent months. In April, John Anderson Campbell, believed to have won the Military Cross for his bravery during the British Army's campaign in Burma, died in a care home at the age of 92 with no known friends or family. However a big crowd turned up for his funeral in Whitley Bay Crematorium following an online appeal. And last month, hundreds of total strangers turned up in Worcester to pay their last respects to D-Day RAF veteran Denis Man, who died with no surviving family.","Church was worried no one would attend funeral of Harold Morgan, 85 .

"The Swedish man who perfected his poker skills while he trained to be a chef is $10 million richer after winning the top World Series of Poker main event prize last night. Martin Jacobson, 27, had three tens to beat Felix Stephensen of Norway and his pair of nines in the Las Vegas tournament. As confetti blasts signalled his win and his friends and family ran to embrace him, Jacobson said: 'There's no such thing as a 'perfect tournament,' but this was close to perfect, maybe.'

Jacobson, pictured with last year's winner Ryan Reiss, holds up the World Series of Poker winning bracelet . Jacobson shows off the winners bracelet which is heavy with diamonds . Jacobson, center with glasses, celebrates with supporters after he is crowned the winner . Jacobson's mother Eva said her son started playing poker after coming home late from restaurant shifts, as none of his friends were awake to chat or hang out. He was the only player of the final nine to have earned more than $1 million in World Series of Poker career earnings at tournaments, but had never won the top spot. Jacobson exhibited a calm stillness throughout the two days of poker playing, and didn't hide himself behind sunglasses, a hoodie or a baseball cap like other players. Instead he often stared at his opponents across the table blinking through black-rimmed glasses. This wasn't Jacobson's first try at the big win. He travelled to Las Vegas, days after he turned 21, to enter the main event. But he busted out after a few hands. 'I think that was good for him,' Eva said in the lobby of the Penn & Teller Theater at the Rio while her son amassed more chips on stage inside. He learned it wasn't going to be an easy task, she said. Jacobson's opponent, Stephensen, 24, took home $5.1 million for second place.

Stephensen said: 'It's disappointing to be so close, but I got really lucky to get this far, and it was a tough final table.' The two defeated Jorryt van Hoof, the leader throughout most of the game play, to go head-to-head. Van Hoof, a poker pro originally from the Netherlands, had an icy stare and a formidable chip lead against two other European players going into last night's final table in the World Series of Poker. All have been vying for the $10 million top prize and a coveted World Series of Poker gold bracelet. Van Hoof, who wore a pair of sunglasses as he played, lost his lead, couldn't regain it, and finally lost after three hours of gameplay with a pair of fives to a pair of tens. But the 31-year-old still took home $3.8 million for coming third. Jorryt van Hoof reacts as he gets knocked out of the last night of the World Series of Poker final table . van Hoof places a bet during the final night of the World Series of Poker final; he finished third . The Dutch pro, who has his own poker coaching business and is known for his cold stare, said he wore sunglasses because of the 'bright studio lights'. Van Hoof also didn't just have a cheering section making creative use of his name ('Van Hoof, van Hoof, van Hoof is on fire,' they chanted). He had an entire team of friends and coaches analyzing spreadsheets, the table play and the half-hour delayed ESPN live broadcast. All that information was given to a captain, of sorts, who would then filter it to van Hoof. It was the first time in the World Series of Poker's history that the final three players in the no-limit Texas Hold 'em main event didn't include a single American.

'We're going to meet up. And the winner will pay for my dinner.' They outlasted six other finalists during 12 hours of gameplay Monday night and into Tuesday morning and began playing no-limit Texas Hold 'em again Tuesday night. Van Hoof had a third more chips than Jacobson and nearly double the total of Stephensen going into the final face-off. The main event, culminating this week, is just one World Series of Poker event but certainly the most watched.

"A woman who admitted she lured a University of New Hampshire student to her apartment as a sex offering for her domineering boyfriend and then helped dispose of the woman's body after he killed and raped her has been denied parole today. Parole was denied on Thursday for 21-year-old Kathryn McDonough who was sentenced in July 2013 to 18 months to three years in prison for lying to police. She was sentenced after her boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia strangled and raped 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott, of Westborough, Massachusetts, at the couple's Dover apartment in October 2012. McDonough told jurors that Mazzaglia, 32, was angry at her when she left him home for two nearly weeks without a sex partner and demanded that she bring him another woman to join in their sexual escapades, which included bondage and discipline. Kathryn McDonough, of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, pictured in an undated police mugshot. She was denied parole today after being sentenced for luring a 19-year-old University of New Hampshire student Elizabeth Marriott to her death as a sex offering for her domineering boyfriend . Lizzi was just 19 years old in October 2012 when she was murdered by Mazzaglia for refusing his sexual advances. Pictured above with her parents . Seth Mazzaglia, pictured in August, was convicted of murder and is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole . When Marriott twice rejected his sexual advances, Mazzaglia strangled her and raped her lifeless body. The couple dumped her body off Portsmouth's Peirce Island. It has never been recovered. McDonough for months told investigators that Marriott died during consensual rough sex between the two women that involved restraints. She admitted she helped dispose of Marriott's body then testified against Mazzaglia this summer as part of her deal for a lighter sentence. Members of Marriott's family were expected to attend Thursday's parole hearing. Mazzaglia was convicted of murder and is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole. Members of Marriott's family spoke scathingly of McDonough when she was sentenced, calling her a cold, calculating woman who betrayed her friend's trust. But 13 months later, after Mazzaglia was sentenced in August, Marriott's father said he had conflicted feelings about her. 'I have a lot of reason to very much dislike her and her involvement in what happened to my daughter,' Bob Marriott said. 'I also have a lot of sympathy for the situation she was in and what she was put through by that person we just sent to jail.' Bob Marriott said during McDonough's sentencing that he and his family grudgingly accepted the plea deal with McDonough to further Mazzaglia's prosecution.

"Three police forces in Britain are under investigation for allegedly failing to act on child porn intelligence, it has emerged. Police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), is looking into Essex, North Yorkshire and North Wales police forces in relation to the way it handled intelligence received from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop). The move comes after Essex Police referred itself to the IPCC following a delay in acting on an intelligence package from the National Crime Agency (NCA) in November 2013, which identified now-deceased teacher Martin Goldberg as a potential paedophile. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), is looking into Essex (pictured), North Yorkshire and North Wales police forces in relation to the way it handled intelligence of child indecency and child porn . Goldberg, who worked at Thorpe Hall School in Southend, was found to have hundreds of images of pupils on his computer when he was discovered dead at his Essex home the day after police had called on him. Following the Essex referral, the IPCC wrote to chief constables of all police forces in England and Wales to ask whether their force received  material dubbed 'Project Spade' from the NCA and, if so, to review the way they treated the information. As a result, the police watchdog received referrals from North Yorkshire and North Wales Police. The Project Spade intelligence was the result of an international probe which caught people attempting to buy child abuse images on the internet. IPCC deputy chairman Sarah Green said: 'There is rightly considerable public concern about how police forces deal with sexual offences involving children. 'The IPCC takes this issue seriously and proactively contacted all forces and asked them to review their handling of intelligence to determine the scale of any issues. 'Our investigations will examine carefully how intelligence from Ceop was dealt with by these three forces.' North Wales Police (pictured) contacted the IPCC after the police watchdog wrote to all forces in the country . The IPCC's Sarah Green said: 'There is rightly considerable public concern about how police forces deal with sexual offences involving children'. Pictured: North Yorkshire Police which is also being investigated . The IPCC has also received a referral from the NCA relating to a failure to send out Project Spade intelligence to UK police forces. Toronto Police  provided the information to Ceop - now part of the NCA - in July 2012 and it included customer details of purchasers of indecent DVDs and videos. However, the information was not handed to UK police forces until November last year. Figures obtained by the Press Association last month showed that more than 200 suspects are still being investigated following the intelligence. Among the 21 UK forces that were able to provide a detailed breakdown of how the Canadian cases - which came out of the international probe dubbed Operation Spade - had progressed, a total of 271 are still ongoing. The figures also showed that from a total of 724 referrals made to the forces concerned, 34 people had been charged and five had accepted cautions. Controversy was sparked when it emerged there had been a delay in dealing with tip-offs  about disgraced Cambridgeshire medic Myles Bradbury (left) and now-deceased paedophile teacher Martin Goldberg (right) Controversy was sparked when it emerged that the tip-offs included information about disgraced Cambridgeshire medic Myles Bradbury, as well as teachers Goldberg and Gareth Williams, who both secretly filmed children. Williams, from Cardiff, is now serving a five-year jail term, but Goldberg was found dead a day after police first contacted him. Following the death of Goldberg, 46, a search of his house was conducted and 7,257 indecent images of children that he had downloaded from the internet were found. In addition, 1,468 images that appear to have been created by Goldberg were discovered, which included 465 images depicting nudity that appeared to have been taken or recorded at Southend Leisure and Tennis Centre swimming pool changing rooms. A further 75 depicting nudity that appear to have been taken or recorded by  Goldberg at Thorpe Hall School boys' changing rooms were also found.","Essex, North Yorkshire and North Wales police forces under investigation .

"When most people are feeling charitable they might sponsor a child or throw a fundraising event - but Scott Loxley chose to walk 5,000km around Australia in a Storm Trooper outfit. The 47-year-old left his hometown of Melbourne on November 2 last year to raise funds for the Monash Children's Hospital and hopes to see his wife and three children by July next year - or earlier if his weary blistered feet can get him there any sooner. The former soldier spends weeks at a time not speaking to anyone other than himself and the animals that cross his long endless dusty path - with fresh roadkill now a regular part of his daily diet. Scroll down for video . Scott Loxley is walking 5,000km around Australia in a Storm Trooper outfit for charity . He carries a swag, water, a first aid kit, a t-shirt and pair of shorts in the trolley he pushes . Scott lives off roadkill including snakes, lizards, goat and kangaroo for weeks at a time . His target is to raise $100,00 funds for Monash Children's Hospital in Melbourne . The simple rule of thumb that Scott abides by when deciding if the animal is safe to eat is 'if it's bloated I don't touch it - if it's still bleeding I eat it.' The tasty wildlife includes cooking lizards until crispy and putting them in ziplock bags to snack on during the trek and tying live snakes to his trolley until they are suitably fried by the sun. Scott, who says it all comes down to survival, has also feasted on a cow, goat and many a Kangaroo by cooking the meat on a wire grill. 'I can only carry so much food - it's not like there's always a servo up the road,' he said. 'I need the protein to keep going.' Scott has been travelling for just over 12 months now and hopes to make it back to Melbourne in July next year . The 47-year-old goes days and weeks without showering or talking to anybody . With only himself and the animals to talk to - Scott is quickly getting sick of his own compnay . He is currently in Coolalinga located 26 km southeast of Darwin in the Northern Territory . He was taught survival skills in the army but never used them to such an extreme until now. 'You pick up things along the way - it comes naturally because if you don't eat - you are going to die.' But don't feel too sorry for the lone adventurer - when Daily Mail Australia caught up with Scott he was chowing down on a Macca's Quarter Pounder meal  in Coolalinga - 26 km southeast of Darwin. 'Anything that you don't cook yourself tastes awesome,' he said. A year into his crazy adventure - Scott can now tick off the following places on his mammoth list: Tasmania, the Nullarbor Plain - from the east to the west coast - and then up to Broome and across the Northern Territory border to Catherine and Darwin. He doesn't advise anyone to take on this challenge on their own: 'solo is not the way to go - it's way too hard' Scott is only resting his exhausted body about five hours a day as he walks though the night as much as possible and then sleeps until the sun becomes unbearable . Literally living in his own stench - Scott can go days or weeks without showering or brushing his teeth because he needs to conserve all of the water that he is carrying in his trolley for drinking. 'I feel absolutely terrible when I put on my black skins in the morning I can't stand the smell but I can't afford to use the water for washing my clothes,' he said. Scott is only resting his exhausted body about five hours a day as he walks though the night as much as possible and then sleeps until the sun becomes unbearable. He rolls his swag out under any form of shelter that he stumbles across including BBQ areas, outside toilet blocks and under trees. Made out of ABS plastic, the suit is a bit worse for wear and is being held together with fibre glass and tape - but at the least the clanging of the armour scares off the snakes. 'It's ridiculous - I have no range of movement,' he said. 'It's really uncomfortable and rubs causing welts and blisters.' 'I'm surprise it has lasted this long.' Only being unwell once briefly when coming into Adelaide, it's not his physical state that has been the most testing but the constant mental challenge . Scott's Storm Trooper helmet makes a friend that is not suitable for dinner . Made out of ABS plastic, the suit is a bit worse for wear and is being held together with fibre glass and tape . Scott has gone through 20 pairs of shoes. His current pair have been the most endurable lasting 3,000 km after he made a sole from a blown-out tyre on the side of the road. Only being unwell once briefly when coming into Adelaide, it's not his physical state that has been the most testing but the constant mental challenge. 'I'm constantly arguing with myself - I start questioning it and thinking no one cares and that I'm yesterday's news,' he said. 'When I haven't seen anybody for a long time I think it's a case of out of sight - out of mind.' 'Then I see someone and they say something encouraging and I'm on top of the world again - and that cycle keeps going,' he said. 'I've been winning and losing throughout the whole battle.' Scott is eternally grateful for the support of his family - especially his understanding wife, Sally. 'She knows me - I've been talking about doing it for a long time - so she said to get it out of the way,' he said. 'I owe her big time after this - I'll make it all better again.' Scott has gone through 20 pairs of shoes. His current pair have been the most endurable lasting 3,000 km after he made a sole from a blown-out tyre on the side of the road . He said the people he meets along the way keeps up his spirits . Scott would never advise anyone to take on this epic challenge without support. 'Solo is not the way to go - it's way too hard,' he said. 'Do it with a couple of people or a group for the mental stimulation and to encourage each other.' He's very quickly getting bored of his own company. 'I'm sick of hearing my own voice - you have to constantly keep motivating yourself because you spend 10 hours a day looking at a white line,' he said. 'I talk to the animals that coming running to the fence.' But the courageous Star Wars character won't give up until he makes it home with raising his target of $100,000 for the Monash Children's Hospital in Melbourne. 'If I don't reach the target I will deem it a massive epic fail,' he said. Help Scott reach his target by donating on his fundraising page.

"Four students returned home to smiles and hugs from family and friends in the US on Tuesday after being briefly detained in Russia during a student leadership conference. The students were held for several hours on Thursday in St. Petersburg. They were allowed to leave the country on Monday after a judge found they possessed the wrong kind of visa and each paid a fine of about $110. 'I'm definitely ecstatic to be home,' Jennifer Phan, 21, said after arriving at San Francisco International Airport. Liana Randazzo, left, smiles as she and Sterling Winter arrive at San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco on Tuesday after their trip to Russia for a leadership conference was cut short . Quyen Ngo, left, hugs Mia Winter, the mother of Sterling Winter after Ngo arrived back in the U.S. Ngo and Sterling Winter were two of the four U.S. students detained after Russian authorities said they had the wrong visas . Phan and her colleagues said Russian authorities didn't mistreat them, and they were never handcuffed or jailed. But Phan and the others believe officials were trying to intimidate them when they walked the group past two dank cells at an immigration center where they were briefly held. The saga began as members of the California Association of Student Councils were meeting with their Russian counterparts in St. Petersburg. Russian authorities barged into a closed meeting on Thursday and demanded to see travel papers from Phan and Sterling Winter, 18, of Chico, and Liana Randazzo, 27, and Quygen Ngo, 24, who are from San Jose. Liana Randazzo, right, hugs her father Joe after arriving home. Despite their ordeal all four said they would return to Russia . Jennifer Phan, right, is greeted by Joe Randazzo, the father of Liana Randazzo. The four students had spent the weekend sightseeing but were tense and confused about how long they might be held . The four took the authorities to their nearby hotel to retrieve the documents, which were deemed insufficient. The U.S. group was then taken to an immigration center about 50 miles away and questioned about their purpose in the country before being brought to a judge. The judge needed more information and ordered a new hearing on Monday, allowing the students to return to their hotel. They said they spent the weekend sightseeing but were tense and confused. Randazzo said they were provided with interpreters, but some of them seemed too friendly with prosecutors arguing that the group possessed the wrong type of visas. 'It was terribly bizarre,' said Randazzo, the group's leader. All four said they would return to Russia. 'Just not anytime soon,' Winter said. Sterling Winter, right, hugs his mother Mia. 'This was a political statement the Russian government was trying to make,' said his father Scott . 'This was a political statement the Russian government was trying to make,' said Scott Winter, who along with his wife, Mia, met their son at the airport. The Tass news agency reported Yulia Nikolayeva, Russia's Federal Migration Service representative in St. Petersburg, said in a court hearing that the four had come to Russia on tourist visas but the activity they participated in was considered 'social-political activity.' June Thompson, executive director of the California Association of Student Councils, said she understands that Russia is sensitive to concerns that Westerners may come to the country to teach locals about political activism, which could be seen as encouraging opposition. 'If they get a sense of an American organization or any foreign money is coming in, then they have to register as a foreign agent,' Thompson said. She said the four handled the situation with extraordinary poise and clear thinking. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed the students were 'briefly detained in St. Petersburg before being released' and they were provided 'all possible assistance.' The conference was being led by the Association of Young Leaders, a Russia-based association that teaches young people leadership skills.

"Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah died of severe smoke inhalation after he tried to rescue his two children from a fire caused by a faulty fridge freezer . Millions of dangerous electrical products are sitting in homes across the country despite being recalled for repairs by manufacturers. The problem reflects the fact that the recall system for appliances, everything from fridge freezers and tumble dryers to chargers, is hopelessly inadequate. Manufacturers face accusations they are slow to recall products that are known to have a fault, while there is no effective system to alert the owners of dangerous products. Generally, the companies will put a warning on their own website, which is difficult to find, or they might advertise in a newspaper on a few occasions. A recent inquest in London heard how Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah, 36, died after suffering severe smoke inhalation when he rescued his two children from a fire caused by a faulty Beko fridge freezer. The Turkish manufacturer had been warned about problems with the appliance but decided not to recall it until after the tragedy in the autumn of November 2010. Subsequently, the coroner recommended far stronger penalties for companies who fail to recall suspect products, including a possible prison sentence. The problem has been highlighted by Electrical Safety First, a charity which runs its own website listing recalled household appliances. It said some four million products have been officially recalled over the last four years, yet the majority of these are still sitting in homes creating the risk of a fire or electric shock. It said some 228 different electrical products have been recalled– including seven types of fridge, four washing machines and seven hairdryers – yet typically only 10-20per cent are ever returned or repaired. The campaign to raise awareness is being supported by Martin Squires who had a fire at his home near Leeds, which was caused by a fault in his Hotpoint dishwasher. ‘It was lucky that I happened to walk into the kitchen as the dishwasher caught fire so I could put it out quickly,’ he said. ‘But my young son was asleep upstairs and I would otherwise have been in bed at that time too. It doesn’t bear thinking about what could have happened. The product was later recalled as a whole batch. ‘It is important for everyone to know that if they are told their item has been recalled it is going to be for a very good reason, and even if the fault is not immediately life-threatening it is not worth the risk keeping it in your home.’ Faulty electrical goods are placing the lives of millions of people at risk according to a new charity . A spokesman for the charity, Emma Apter, said: ‘Whilst the chances of a faulty product causing serious damage are small, the risk is still there and returning a faulty product, or ordering its repair, is very easy to do. ‘We’re working with manufacturers to improve the recall system but in the meantime we urge everyone to do anything they can to look after themselves, whether that’s registering a product when you buy it or keeping an eye out for recall notices. ‘We’d also encourage everyone to use our free online checker, to see if you have any recalled items in your home today.’","Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah died after a faulty fridge freezer caught fire .

"An academy headmaster paid nearly £230,000 a year also raked in cash running a business based at the school. Sir Greg Martin enjoyed a 56 per cent pay rise last year. He is also sole director of a company which managed a health club and accommodation business on his school’s site and his ex-wife is the school’s deputy head. A probe by the National Audit Office found Sir Greg’s firm was paid £508,000 in management fees over the past three years alone. Sir Greg Martin (pictured), headteacher of Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, enjoyed a 56 per cent pay rise last year, taking his total pay package up to just under £230,000 including pension contributions . Investigators were unable to determine the extent to which he benefited from the arrangement, which the Department for Education has now ended. The NAO said Sir Greg ‘received payments in the form of director’s remuneration and/or dividends’ on top of his headteacher’s pay. Now the Education Funding Agency, an arm of the DfE which policies academies, ‘is planning to undertake a review of academy heads’ salaries’. In a report published today the NAO reveals Sir Greg was handed a pay rise of 56.5 per cent in 2012/13, taking his pay package to £229,138 including pension contributions. This made him ‘one of the highest paid executive heads in the country’. Yet earlier this year Ofsted downgraded his school – Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London – from ‘outstanding’ to ‘good’. The report also reveals that for nearly two years the day-to-day running of the school has been delegated to Sir Greg’s ex-wife, Nathalie Parker, who earned a salary of between £115,000 and £120,000. NAO investigators found a ‘complex’ structure had grown up around Durand Academy and organisations linked to it. They uncovered evidence of a ‘large number of conflicts of interest in the way that it managed its academy and its assets’. Sir Greg (pictured) employed his ex-wife at the school, who earned a salary of between £115,000 and £120,000 . These included a contract with a lobbying and public relations firm – PLMR – whose managing director, Kevin Craig, is the school’s vice-chairman of governors. Payments totalling £583,000 were made to PLMR over three years. Durand Academy recently became the first state primary to open its own secondary boarding school. Pupils aged 13 to 18 are bussed to a mock Tudor mansion in Stedham, West Sussex, each week for an ‘Eton-style experience’. The NAO said it had been told of ‘value for money concerns about the boarding school’, which is being backed by the Government to the tune of £17.34million. Sir Greg – who was knighted for services to education in last year’s Queens Birthday Honours – married Miss Parker in May 1996. The pair, who have two sons together, divorced three years later. Miss Parker was appointed acting head at Durand in September 2012. The NAO report said Miss Parker ‘was appointed through an externally advertised, competitive process and Sir Greg was not on the panel that appointed her’. A probe by the National Audit Office (pictured) found Sir Greg’s firm was paid £508,000 in management fees over the past three years alone. Investigators found a ‘complex’ structure had grown around the academy . It also emerged that Sir Greg received an unspecified sum for running a leisure and accommodation business at the school. The non-profit London Horizons business – a gym, health spa and flats – generates income which is ploughed back into the school. London Horizons has paid GMG, a firm of which Sir Greg is listed as the sole director, for running the business for more than a decade. Between 2011 and 2014, £508,000 was paid in management fees from London Horizons to GMG. After scrutinising Durand’s accounts, the EFA earlier this year ordered the academy to terminate the contract with GMG due to the risk of a ‘conflict of interest’. Research by the EFA suggests contracts at 17 academy trusts in 2012/13 were improper or irregular. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘It just feels wrong that individuals sitting on the board of the Durand Academy Trust could set up such a complex web of organisations and companies some of which are selling goods and services to the academy. ‘It’s not at all clear if individuals within the trust were improperly benefiting from these companies.’ A spokesman for Durand Academy Trust said: ‘Sir Greg has a hugely demanding role and he has always innovated. We are privileged to retain the services of such a dedicated education leader.’","Sir Greg Martin enjoyed a 56 per cent pay rise last year, earning  £229,138 .

"Residents in Somerset are bracing themselves for another round of catastrophic flooding after the area's main river rose to a dangerous level, amid warnings of a 'conveyor belt' of winter storms. Heavy rain has caused the River Parrett at Burrowbridge, near Bridgwater, to rise by a staggering two metres, leaving it just one metre away from bursting its banks. The perilously-high levels caused the water to spill over into dozens of  gardens, just 11 months since the last major flooding incident in Somerset. It comes less than two weeks after the Environment Agency finished dredging two of the area's rivers in an attempt to prevent future flooding. Scroll down for video . The rivers in the area, including the River Parrett (pictured), rose by a staggering two metres, amid further warnings of localised flooding . The high levels come just six months after the heaviest January rainfall in 250 years forced thousands to flee their homes . The high levels of the main river caused water to spill over into houses and gardens in the area, threatening a repeat of January's disaster . A car drives through flood water in Oath, Somerset, as the area braces itself for more catastrophic flooding and days of heavy rainfall . Dredging has been taking place since March, as part of a £5.8million plan to clear a five-mile stretch of the Tone and Parrett rivers, in a bid to increase their capacity and reduce the risk of them overflowing during periods of heavy rainfall. The project was started after the heaviest January rainfall for 250 years flooded the Somerset Levels, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. But residents were sand-bagging their homes, after forecasters warned heavy rain and fierce winds of up to 70mph could batter the UK - especially the south west. Forecasters have warned that a spiralling 3,000-mile diameter weather front, which brought downpours to the UK this morning, will continue to sweep in from the Atlantic, bringing wet weather misery and gale-force winds until at least Sunday. The bleak-looking forecast has led to severe weather warnings being put in place across large parts of Britain, with the south west of England, south Wales and parts of Ireland expected to suffer the worst. Forecasters say gusts of up to 70mph are expected to sweep across the Irish Sea, potentially wreaking havoc as they hit the mainland. And they have also warned people to be on their guard for flooding all over the country, due to the onslaught of 'persistent' rain expected over the past few days. Residents began sand-bagging their homes as forecasters issued severe weather warnings across parts of the UK, including Somerset . Meteorologists have warned people to be on their guard for flooding all over the country, due to the onslaught of 'persistent' rain expected . And even though there will be a brief let-up early next week, a second weather front will reach the UK on Wednesday, pushing rain over and southern Britain again and presenting problems for residents in Somerset . A car drives over the bridge, as the River Parrett continues to rise to a very high level, blocking off the arch to the bridge . Dredging has been taking place since March, as part of a £5.8million plan to clear a five mile stretch of the nearby Tone and Parrett rivers . The project is a bid to increase the capacity of the rivers, and reduce the risk of them overflowing during periods of heavy rainfall . But, despite the alarming sight, some locals said it was nothing unusual for this time of year. Jenny Winslade, who was forced to evacuate her farm and home last winter, said: 'It has been raining a lot over the weekend - this is probably water from three days ago. 'We are designed to take a bit of water - the key thing is how fast they get rid of of it and now we have super duper wide dredged rivers there is plenty of room for water.' South Somerset District Council held a meeting to reassure residents they were doing everything possible to prevent last year's tragedy from repeating. Representatives from the Environment Agency's explained work being done to reduce the risk of flooding, while local council chiefs discussed back up plans. Residents were also told about measures which have been put in place to keep the roads in use, as well as rescue operations and community flood plans. Councillor Ric Pallister, leader of South Somerset District Council said: 'A lot has happened since the disastrous events of last winter and much work is still going on. '(The meeting is) an opportunity for the broader community to understand what has changed, what flood prevention measures have been put in place and what will now be different should we experience similar conditions across South Somerset in the future.' Meteorologists say that, although the route of the rainfall is difficult to predict, almost nowhere in Britain will escape the wet weather. And even though there will be a brief let-up early next week, a second weather front will reach the UK on Wednesday, pushing rain over central and southern Britain towards the middle and end of next week. Nicki Willis from the Met Office said: 'Bands of rain will keep coming through and, while they are not unusual, they are fairly static and continuous. We are getting a big accumulation of rainfall and it will be hanging around for quite a while. 'We are looking at unsettled weather over the next few days. Most places throughout the next couple of days will see some rain at some time.' The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings for the south west, south Wales and parts of the south coat tomorrow, where rain will be particularly heavy in the evening. Areas in Northern Ireland, south west England and Wales could see up to 70mm fall over tomorrow and Friday, the Met Office said. The average total rainfall for the UK over the whole of November is 120mm. Residents in Bournemouth sheltered from the rain this morning, as more wet weather and strong gusts are expected to hit the UK . Forecasters have warned people to be braced for localised flooding, due to the onslaught of 'persistent' rain expected over the next few days, as shown here in Bournemouth . Severe weather warnings are in place across the south west, south Wales and the south coast, where there were strong winds this morning . Workmen in Bournemouth began setting up the Christmas market stalls despite the wet weather which swept across Dorset . Cornwall, parts of Devon and South Wales will experience the worst of the strong winds, with a wind weather warning in place tomorrow . And there is also a 24-hour warning in place for heavy rain over Northern Ireland, which starts at midday tomorrow. Although the weekend is looking slightly brighter, there will still be showers and strong winds, with only central England expected to be given some dry weather reprieve. But, despite feeling breezy, temperatures will remain around average - about 9 degrees - for the time of year. A spokesman for Meteogroup said: 'Very unsettled on Friday with heavy rain across much of the UK. Remaining windy in many eastern areas. 'Saturday will see the risk of rain in northern and eastern parts of Scotland as well as eastern parts of England. Some sunny spells are possible further south and west across the UK but with the risk of a scattering of showers too, these most likely in Wales and south-west England.' Leon Brown, Chief Meteorologist, from the Weather Channel, said: 'There is a large low pressure circulation over the eastern Atlantic, some 3,000 miles in diameter, and this spiralling low pressure system will very gradually move eastwards over western Europe this weekend, slowly 'spinning itself out'. This three-day forecast shows heavy rain across many parts of the UK. Fog could also spread across the country on Saturday . Weather warnings are in place across the south west and west of Wales and England with more warnings expected over the next few days . 'Bands of rain will move around it so we can expect quite unsettled weather, but the timing and track of these disturbances is difficult to forecast. 'There is also another smaller disturbance way out over the mid Atlantic that is now caught in the jet stream. The jet stream will bring this quickly around the southern flank of the upper low over the east Atlantic and then northwards over the western side of the UK on Thursday. 'The system will be travelling at 40 to 50mph as it runs up over SW England on Thursday morning and then western Wales to the Irish Sea by Thursday afternoon. 'Gales for a time as it moves north with gusts 60mph over exposed parts of the south west and south and west Wales with the risk of brief gusts to 70mph across some headlands and hills. Some heavy rain too over Wales and especially east and northern Ireland with yet another 30 to 40mm for Ulster. 'The next pulse of rain will push across all areas on Thursday night to Friday. This now looks like it will move a little more quickly so rainfall totals not as high as earlier expected with typically 7 to 15mm for England and Wales, but 30 to 40mm for the southern Highlands and particularly the southern Grampians. 'As pressure rises early next week the weather becoming drier and a little more settled for a time, but the next area of low pressure is likely to reach the west during Wednesday and push rain over central and southern Britain by Thursday.' The Met Office said earlier this week that its latest three-month outlook suggests that there is an increased risk of milder and wetter than average conditions for November, December and January.","Rivers in Somerset have risen by two metres, just 11 months after the last major flooding incident in the area .

"Paula Abdul was ‘very gracious’ and Nicole Scherzinger was ‘disappointed’ about being fired from The X Factor, Simon Cowell has revealed. The former American Idol judge has given his first candid interview about the behind-the-scenes shake-up that rocked the U.S. talent show last month. Cowell, 52, spoke to ex-girlfriend Terri Seymour in a segment for the entertainment show, Extra. Goodbye: Simon Cowell has opened up about firing Nicole Scherzinger and Paula Abdul from The X Factor judging panel on the US version of the show after just one season . The presenter wasted no time in finding out, when and why Abdul and Scherzinger were sacked and how they reacted to the news. Cowell said that Fox network executives told him ‘at the beginning of the year’ that changes needed to be made to the show, which averaged 12.6 million viewers by the end of its first season. ‘It was fairly straight what they wanted,’ he said. ‘We were told it had to happen straight away.’ Cowell said that Abdul, 49, was ‘fine’ and ‘gracious’ when she heard the news. Explanation: Cowell told Extra why The X Factor had to change after its debut season . Last one standing: LA Reid is the only judge - apart from Cowell - to be kept on from the first series . He said of his former American Idol colleague: ‘She was fine. I called her that night. ‘She was very gracious and I said that to her. She understands it’s business.  It’s never personal.’ He went on to say: ‘I would have liked to have kept her. ‘ . Cowell also opened up about Scherzinger. Speaking of the 33-year-old former Pussy Cat Doll, he said ‘I don’t think she’s mad. I think she’s disappointed.’ Cowell didn’t address the removal of Steve Jones, who was brought over from the UK to host the US version of the show. But he did explain the decision to keep LA Reid, the only judge, other than himself, from the original team. He said: ‘There’s not a record executive out there who is as good as him.’ Former colleagues: Cowell said that Scherzinger was 'disappointed' but not 'mad' at being let go . Grilling: Cowell sat down with ex-girlfriend Terri Seymour for the candid interview with Extra . Cowell refused to be drawn into which personalities have been approached to join the judging panel. He did, however, take the time to dispel rumours that he has offered Beyonce $100 million to be on the next series. Cowell vehemently denied the claims, saying: ‘No. I have no idea where this rumour came from. ‘I read it online that I'd offered her $100 million a year. It's complete nonsense. ‘The budget of the show is $100 million. No one is going to pay $100 million a year for someone. ‘Forget it. No. It would never ever, ever, happen. It's absolute nonsense. ‘And I genuinely haven’t had a conversation with her about it. I swear to God. No. ‘ . Cowell also slapped down rumours he has made an offer to Mariah Carey, who gave birth to twins last year. ‘She's not on the list because I don't think Mariah would make that commitment,’ he said. The original team: Cowell poses with The X Factor judges and Jones who appeared in the first series after Cheryl Cole had been let go . ‘She's just had kids…You have to work five days a week on this show and you've got to do all this travelling as well. ‘So, just to put it out there, she will not be on the list. ‘I would love her [to do it], but you can't expect someone who's just had two kids, who's got a record career, to make the kind of commitment you would need on this show.’ Cowell remained tight-lipped about who he has considered for the two judging vacancies. But when asked about other possible celebrities he was quick to give his opinion. He said Elton John was ‘absolutely not’ being considered. ‘He wouldn't do it and he would be really difficult to work with,’ Cowell said of the Crocodile Rock singer. He said Madonna would be ‘great.’ Not bothered: Cowell seems unperturbed by rival talent show The Voice, which boasts celebrity judges like Christina Aguilera and Cee-Lo Green . No mention: Cowell didn't discuss fellow Brit Steve Jones, pictured with Scherzinger, who was also let go from the show . ‘In terms of experience and success I think she would be brilliant,’ he told Seymour before saying that she would also be ‘lippy’ and ‘expensive.’ Cowell also said that Katy Perry would be ‘fun’ and ‘hard’ but ‘feisty’ at the same time. The X Factor creator was adamant that he is not looking for celebrity judges. American Idol boasts singers Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler on their judging panel, while The Voice has pop stars like Christina Aguilera and Cee-Lo Green. Cowell said: ‘I’m not playing this game where we have to compete on the level of A-lister stars. ‘Once you go down that route, you’re headed for big trouble…because you can lose focus on what the show is all about and at the end of  the day the most important thing is the contestants and I want to put all my resources into finding stars from the show.’ He also said: ‘The show has to evolve. We have some thoughts and you’re going to find out in the next few weeks.’ Before . The X Factor premiered in the US last year Cowell predicted it was . going to be a huge ratings winner that would rival American Idol. While he won’t say the first season was a failure, he admits that he was overconfident. ‘Most things did work,’ he said. ‘It's only because I opened my big mouth and said we were going to get 20million [viewers]. ‘If I hadn't said that, everybody would be saying the show, as a new show, was a huge success.’ On Sunday night the second series of The Voice debuted with a massive 37.6 million viewers. The show, which has been a hit with the US TV audience, focuses on four celebrity singers, mentoring competitors on the basis of their vocal ability rather than their appearance. Cowell doesn’t believe this is a unique approach but rather something that he pioneered through The X Factor, which first aired in the UK in 2004. ‘Everyone thinks The Voice started this whole mentoring thing, but it’s complete nonsense,’ he said. ‘Our show was on years before them and we were always different from other shows because our judges were mentors and then they come out with The Voice in America and they have mentors. ‘But that was copied from us.’","Former American Idol judge was 'fine' and 'gracious' when told she was fired .

"A tech guru who was accused of making 'weird and insensitive' comments about the murderous manifesto written by Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger has been fired. Rap Genius co-founder Mahbod Moghadam posted a series of bizarre annotations alongside extracts from the virgin killer's 141-page memoir, including one that speculates that Rodger's sister must be 'smokin hot'. After the accusations, he was lambasted as being misogynistic, and it has since emerged that he was let go from the company he helped found. 'Mahbod Moghadam, one of my co-founders, annotated the piece with . annotations that not only didn’t attempt to enhance anyone’s . understanding of the text, but went beyond that into gleeful . insensitivity and misogyny,' Rap Genius co-founder and CEO Tom Lehman wrote in a statement. Scroll down to read the manifesto in full . 'Weird': Rap Genius co-founder Mahbod Moghadam (left) has come under fire for posting creepy comments about the murderous manifesto of Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger . He added that this 'is contrary to everything we’re . trying to accomplish at Rap Genius' and that Moghadam had resigned. But sources told Recode that he had actually been fired after pressue from investors. Rodger's chilling dossier - entitled My Twisted World - sheds light the depth of the 22-year-old's rage which was mainly targeted at young women who he blamed for that fact he was still a virgin. Yet, in a number of posts, Moghadam praised the gunman for his 'beautiful' writing and joked about his sister. Rap Genius is a website dedicated to the annotation and interpretation of lyrics, poetry and other forms of text.

'Ignores the memoir's context as a prelude to mass murder': Moghadam again praises Rodger's writing . Ilan Zechory, another Rap Genius co-founder, took issue with his colleague's comments, saying they had embarrassed the website. In an email to Business Insider, he said: 'Mahbod's annotations... are inconsiderate, uninteresting, and insensitive. It was horrible judgment to annotate in the way that Mahbod did. 'Thankfully the Rap Genius community is much more than one person and when people put up stuff like this, it gets edited quickly. It's obviously embarrassing that it comes from a rap genius founder.' Moghadam later gave a statement to . Valleywag's Nitasha Tiku, which read: 'I was fascinated by the fact that . a text was associated with such a heartbreaking crime, especially since .

'I got carried away with making the annotations and making any comment about his sister was in horrible taste. 'Thankfully the rap genius community edits out my poor judgement, I am very sorry for writing it.' The controversy came as it emerged Rodger is quickly acquiring an army of sick female fans who have come out in praise of the shooter despite his mass killing. Perversely, many of them are from the . very demographic - young women - that caused him to foster such growing . hatred because of his failure to strike relationships with them in life.

"Just one of more than 200 Afghan interpreters who say they've been threatened by the Taliban for their work with British soldiers has been given a UK visa. Most have instead been simply told to change their mobile phone numbers and switch their usual routes to avoid being attacked, The Times said. But they say the threat of violent reprisals from the Taliban has grown since British forces finally withdrew from Helmand last month. Many fear for their lives. Prince Harry directs two Afghan men around a British Army cordon, with the help of an Afghan interpreter, in 2008: Just one of 200 interpreters who say they've been threatened have been granted a UK visa . One 25-year-old who worked with British troops in Helmand for three years and has been forced into hiding away from his wife and children told The Times he felt abandoned. 'I have been facing very serious problems. The Taliban know I have worked for the coalition forces and they are looking for me,' he told The Times' defence editor Deborah Haynes. 'They have tried a couple of attacks either to capture or kill me. That is the reason I am not staying at home and I tell nobody whenever I visit my home.' Up to 600 Afghan civilian workers are understood to be eligible for relocation to Britain under an immigration scheme available to those with at least a year's continuous service who were still in their posts in December 2012. So far 31 former interpreters and their families have moved to the UK under the scheme, The Times reports. Their residency visas last five years, at the end of which they will be expected to return to Afghanistan. But the system for assessing the risk to those who left the job before that date has been criticised by workers facing Taliban violence as a result of their employment by the Army. That cut-off point, they say, excludes many of those most at risk – men who were the 'eyes and the ears' of the British during the worst of the bloody fighting in Helmand province in the five years up to 2010 – and now live in fear after being forced to quit because of a campaign of terror by the Taliban. Of more than 200 claims, seven were classified 'amber' risk, qualifying them for assistance relocating within Afghanistan, and just one case was put in the 'red' bracket, meaning a move to the UK. British troops withdraw from Afghanistan: Since the UK ended operations in the country last month, local former workers say threats and intimidation from the Taliban have intensified . Last year a Daily Mail investigation spoke to 31 current and former British military and intelligence interpreters in Afghanistan and all claimed to be in fear of their lives after receiving specific and personal death threats. They described how their relatives had been killed and tortured by militants looking for them, how they have had to move home regularly and how their children have to be taken out of school. Many said they had been regularly threatened by telephone voice and text messages despite repeatedly changing and destroying SIM cards. In one of the most disturbing claims, some said they had been threatened by members of the Afghan police and Afghan National Army. Some had already suffered appalling injuries working alongside British troops in combat situations. Pictured left is Shafiullah who lost part of his arm when he was blown up on patrol with British forces. Right is Mohammad Rafi Hottak, who was also caught in an explosion. Both had problems getting UK visas . In July the former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown accused the government of 'shaming the nation' for failing to process visa applications for Afghan interpreters quickly enough. Last year Winston Churchill's great-grandson Alexander Perkins, an Afghanistan veteran, delivered a petition to Downing Street demanding asylum for those who helped British forces. The U.S., Australia and Germany have all granted asylum to interpreters who worked with their soldiers while fighting in Afghanistan. A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: 'We take reports of threats and intimidation very seriously and investigate all cases thoroughly, taking action as appropriate in consultation with the LEC (locally engaged civilian). 'The intimidation policy provides a robust and responsive means for addressing these concerns and we regularly encourage LECs to report any issues.'","Former interpreters say they face greater threat since UK forces withdrew .

"Fast food giant Subway has removed ham and bacon from almost 200 outlets, and switched to halal meat alternatives in an attempt to please its Muslim customers. It has confirmed turkey ham and turkey rashers will be used instead in 185 of its stores, where all the meat will now be prepared according to halal rules. The chain, which has around 1,500 outlets across the UK, explained its decision by saying it had to balance animal welfare concerns with 'the views of religious communities'. Scroll down for video . Nearly 200 Subway branches across the UK and Ireland have cut out ham and bacon, selling only halal meat, in response to demand from their multicultural customers . Traditional halal slaughter sees . animals have their throats slit before bleeding to death. But Subway . stressed that the meat served in its sandwiches would come from animals . that have been stunned first, a practice that aims to reduce any . suffering. In Arabic the word halal means 'permitted' or 'lawful' and defines anything that is allowed or lawful according to the Qur'an. It is often used to indicate food - particularly meat - has been prepared in accordance with Muslim principles and techniques. Muslims are forbidden from eating any non-halal food and meat from pigs and Subway said customers can identify those stores selling halal food by the special 'All meats are Halal' sign, which must be displayed in participating branches. In the halal-only branches ham and bacon has been substituted for turkey ham and rashers. Many animal charities condemn halal slaughter as being cruel to animals. Traditionally in halal abattoirs the throats of the animals are cut while they are fully conscious - an act many campaigners say is inhumane and needlessly cruel. In the halal-only stores ham and bacon have been substituted for turkey ham and turkey rashers, the sandwich chain said. A spokeswoman said all halal meat served in Subway branches has come from animals that were stunned before being slaughtered . In non-halal abattoirs, livestock are stunned before killing to prevent any unnecessary suffering. Some halal butchers also practise pre-stunning, though it is not permitted by some Islamic scholars. In . Britain, killing an animal without prior stunning is illegal, but the . law gives special exemption to Muslim and Jewish meat producers on the . grounds of religion. There . are thought to be around 12 abattoirs dedicated to unstunned slaughter . in the UK, while hundreds practise stunned halal slaughter. A . Subway spokeswoman told MailOnline all halal meat served in the . participating branches is from animals who were stunned prior to . slaughter. She said: 'The growing popularity of the Subway chain with the diverse multicultural population across the UK and . Ireland means we have to balance the values of many religious . communities with the overall aim of improving the health and welfare . standards of animals. 'We put a programme into place in 2007 to . ensure that the population demographic is taken into account when new . store openings are considered in order that we meet consumer demand in . each location.

'All our suppliers comply with EU animal welfare . legislation as a minimum and we require suppliers of halal products to . adopt the stunning of animals prior to their slaughter. 'All halal meats . are certified by the appropriate halal authorities. 'All halal . Subway stores have numerous signs stating that they serve halal food. 'These are situated on the menu panels, nutritional information and in . the front window of the store.' Animal campaigning charity PETA urged people to opt for a vegetarian diet to ensure they have the best interests of animals at heart. A spokesman said: 'At the best of times, meat is a . product of a bloody and violent industry with no respect for other . living beings who value their lives in the same way that we do and . experience the same pain and terror that Subways' customers would if . they were killed for a sandwich. 'Most religions, including Islam, preach kindness to animals, but words are one thing and practice another. 'As . the Dalai Lama said, ""My religion is kindness"". And a diet that . expresses kindness, is open to all religions and truly respects animal . rights is a vegan one. 'Subway-goers, . no matter what their religion, can eat with a clear conscience by . opting for the veggie patty, the veggie delight or, heaven forbid, a . salad.' Speaking about the general issue of halal slaughter, an RSPCA spokeswoman added: 'Scientific research has clearly shown that slaughter of an animal without stunning can cause unnecessary suffering, and the RSPCA is opposed to the slaughter of any animal without first making it insensible to pain and distress. 'At present, the only legal exemptions to stunning during slaughter exist for kosher and halal methods of slaughter, however, it is important to differentiate between ‘religious’ and ‘non-stun’ slaughter as around 90 per cent of all halal in the UK receives a stun before slaughter. 'Our concern has nothing to do with the expression of religious belief but with the practice of killing by throat cutting without pre-stunning. 'We believe that meat produced from animals stunned or not stunned before slaughter should be clearly labelled to allow consumer choice, and continue to press for changes in the law that would improve the welfare of all farm animals at the time of slaughter.' Halal refers to any object or action which is permissible according to Islamic law. The term covers not only food and drink but also matters of daily life. Halal foods are those that Muslims are allowed to eat or drink under Islamic Shari'ah. The criteria dictates both food which are allowed and how the food must be prepared. The foods most commonly addressed are types of meat and animal tissue. The most common example of non-halal, or forbidden food is pork. It is the only meat that must not be eaten by Muslims at all, due to historical, cultural and religiously perceived hygienic concerns. Other meats can be forbidden, depending on their source, the cause of the animal's death and how it was processed. To be halal, the food must have come from a supplier that uses halal practises. Specifically the slaughter must be performed by a Muslim, who must invoke the name of Allah prior to killing the animal. Commonly a person will say 'Bismillah' ('In the name of God') before repeating 'Allahu akbar' ('God is the greatest') three times. The animal is then slaughtered with a sharp knife, by cutting the throat, windpipe and blood vessels in the neck without cutting the spinal cord. The blood must then be drained from the veins of the animal. Traditionally and according to Islamic scholars an animal must be conscious while slaughtered. However the majority of halal abattoirs stun the animals before killing them. Muslims must also ensure that all foods, particularly processed foods, as well as non-food items like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, are halal.","185 branches across UK and Ireland now sell halal-only meat .

"Russian 'lesbian couple' Irina Shumilova and Alyona Fursova have spoken out about their unique 'same sex' marriage in a country that bans such unions. They were allowed to go ahead because Irina was born a man. Asked why they wed, Irina said: 'In fact it is very simple. Why do people get married?' Scroll down for video . Irina Shumilova (pictured left) and Alyona Fursova (right) have become the first lesbian couple to legally wed in Russia . 'To express their feelings, it's natural. Secondly, marriage gives certain guarantees. If something bad happens to me or with Alena, we are relatives, we can come to hospital and so on. 'But the main reason - feelings of course.' She added: 'Legally we have everything in order, it is all within the law. And from a legal point of view, we are heterosexual couple, but de jure and de facto may slightly differ in real life.' Alena said that if Irina, 24, re-registers herself as a woman after a sex change their union could become 'null and void'. 'We can lose the rights that heterosexual couples have. So we decided to use this opportunity to get married, at least now, when we can do this.' The couple both chose to wear lace wedding gowns as they tied the knot in front of family and friends . Irina denied she intended to campaign for same sex marriages. 'I'm not an activist. Seriously, I am not interested in this,' she said. Critic Vitaly Milonov - a St Petersburg MP and staunch opponent of gay rights - has demanded that their marriage should be declared illegal. 'If to comment on the words of Milonov, that we are mentally ill or something - we are not mentally ill, homosexuality was removed from the banned list a long time ago. 'Our marriage is correct from legal point of view, so he will fail to dissolve it,' said Irina. She was 'tired' of the media circus around their wedding but added: 'We would like that in our country there was a legal way, like a partnership, when two people who are dear to each other can legally be together'. Irina watches as Alyona signs the wedding registry - but one Russian MP has questioned the marriage . Alena said: 'The way it happened, it happened. I'm glad that media were able to cover it and to focus on the problems which face LGBT people.' Irina said she does intend to change her registration to be a woman. 'I will change my gender in not less than two years. I am going to change my passport. But what the legal consequences of this will be, I do not know, and have never thought about it.' The couple married at a registry office in St Petersburg, with both choosing to wear traditional white wedding dresses for the day. Irina and Alyona celebrate becoming Russia's first gay couple to marry . Their situation was explained by LGBT rights activist Anna Anisimova: 'The official registration by two women happened because one of them is a man according to the documents,' she said. 'Formally it was a wedding between a man and a woman but de-facto it was between two women. It was the first (LGBT wedding) in Russia. Both brides wore white dresses.' Following their nuptials Irina and Alyona were given a legal marriage certificate. Irina is currently undergoing hormone therapy and wears a blonde wig and make-up at all times. Irina and Alyona celebrate with a group of friends on the steps at the registry office in St Petersburg . St Petersburg MP Vitaly Milonov said he will investigate the validity of their marriage claimed the workers at the registry office should not just have checked their sex on their passports. Milonov reportedly told the Russian media, 'I understood their [registry office workers'] unconvincing arguments; they formally approached the issue and saw passports, but not people. I told the head [of the wedding registry office] that it is criminal negligence.' He went on to say the wedding was, 'an ugly insult to millions of Russian families in the future... There are certain moral standards which it is vital to implement. These mad people should be banned altogether from getting married.' A smiling Irina is handed a wedding certificate by their wedding registrar. She could not hide her excitement at getting married to Alyona . The couple are cheered on by their friends and family as they celebrated their wedding over the weekend at a beautiful registry office in Russua . Gay marriage has only recently been legalised in the UK. The legislation to allow same-sex marriage was passed in July 2013 and came into effect in March 2014. The first official gay marriage took place on the 29th of March 2014. Prior to this same-sex couples who wished to solidify their union would have to enter into a civil partnership. This gave them the same rights as married couples however they were not allowed to refer to themselves as 'married.' Russia is known for its discrimination against those in the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Until 1999 homosexuality was referred to as a mental illness. And although sexual activity between same-sex consenting adults in private has not been a criminal offence since 1993 there are still strict rules over the propagation of gay rights propaganda. Indeed, in 2013 a law was put in place banning the distribution of materials promoting the LGBT community to young children. And earlier this year a shocking documentary named Hunted highlighted the plight of gay people in Russia. Although many see Irina and Alyona's marriage as a step forward for the country and the first of its kind gay rights activist Nikolay Alekseev disagrees. He told Russian TV show Russia Today that he does not believe their wedding should be counted as a same sex marriage. He said: 'This is in no way a same-sex marriage. This is a question of transgender, not homosexuality. 'This is an old story, there have been such cases before. A certain gender is written in a passport, but how they dress for the wedding is their business.'","Irina Shumilova and Alyona Fursova married over the weekend .

"While some grown men may secretly hold on to a beloved teddy bear, 36-year-old Jena Pang is happy to show the world his favourite stuffed toys... all 250 of them. The  ex-solicitor is rarely seen in public without one of his treasured bears at his side. Jena, who still lives with his mother in Essex, flies them first class when he goes on holiday and takes them to the theatre and opera at Glyndebourne. Vast collection: Jena Pang with some of his teddy bears. The musician is auctioning off his £150,000 collection of a hundred antique teddy bears - because if he took them with him to his new home in Hong Kong he believes they will rot . He has also shared afternoon tea with them at some of London’s finest restaurants including The Ritz, The Dorchester and The Savoy. And at home he lines them up as an audience for his young pupils as he teaches the piano and violin. Jena started collecting antique teddies in 2002 as an investment and since then has bought around 500 of them - spending around £200,000. He sold half in 2010 and is now about to auction a further 120 as he prepares to move to Hong Kong, where his family originate from. Out and about: Jena Pang and his mother, who he lives with, with teddy Hoi Sum enjoying afternoon tea at the Four Seasons hotel. He started collecting antique toys in 2002 and the hobby has seen him spend £200,000 on around 500 bears . Jena fears many of his rarer bears - some up to 100 years old - will not survive the tropical humidity of the Far East and is reluctantly saying goodbye to them. His collection includes 32 Steiff bears which are expected to fetch a staggering £100,000 at the auction next month. The remaining bears could raise a further £50,000. Jena, who lives with his mother in Southend, Essex, said: 'I have loved teddy bears since I was a child. 'In my music training I used to have bears around the room as my audience to play to. 'As I have got older and madder I have had them all around as audiences for my pupils to prepare them for concerts. 'Teddy bears are very special because they are like special friends. They all have characters and they all know our secrets.' Swanky lifestyle: Roddy and Jena Pang lunching at Harrods. His bears regularly travel first class, dine with him at The Ritz and even accompany him to the Glyndebourne opera. The music teacher even uses the bears as an audience for his pupils in a bid to prepare them for playing in front of large audiences . He added: 'I viewed them as an investment. When the economy was doing really bad I decided to invest in teddy bears. 'The property market was dodgy at the time so I thought I should invest in something else and I chose toys. 'Once you get hooked on bear collecting you see there’s a community out there of people who like those kind of things.' The most Jena has spent on a single bear is £10,000 and most of his vintage ones cost no less than £6,000. Up for grabs: The 102 lots of the toys will go on the sale next month - with just 32 Steiff bears expected to sell for a staggering £100,000 (here he is pictured with Binky at The Dorchester) High rolling lifestyle: Bertie and Winston with Jena Pang and his mother at Glyndebourne opera Festival 2010 . Oxford-educated, he has made his money from the legal profession - and as a talented musician who is proficient at both the piano and violin. He said: 'The antique bears are made of wood, wool and kapok so in the damp humidity they would begin to rot. 'To have such an amazing collection just rot away would be such a shame. I would be mortified if anything happened to them. 'If I was to be selfish and take them with me then they would just rot and a future generation would be robbed of them. 'In Hong Kong people have clothes which go mouldy and I can’t keep these bears in an air conditioned unit 24/7. 'For me I just want to preserve the toys for a future generation and to have that collection survive. 'I am saddened to have to lose my bears but at the same time I’m glad other people are going to be able to enjoy them.' Dining out: He takes the bears to luxurious places like The Dorchester and says they know all of his secrets . Collector's items: Oxford-educated, he has made his money from the legal profession - and as a talented musician who is proficient at both the piano and violin . Saddened: He says that he just wants to preserve the toys for a future generation and to have that collection survive so he is auctioning them off . Daniel Agnew is one of the UK’s top teddy bear specialists and said Jena’s collection will generate worldwide interest. He said: 'This is the best single owner collection of early Steiff bears to be seen at auction for many years and it is certainly the finest collection of antique bears ever to appear regionally in the UK. 'With such fine examples on offer, we anticipate a great deal of worldwide interest in this sale.' After the sale Jena’s collection will be reduced to just a hundred modern artist bears. His antique toys will be put up for sale at Special Auction Services in Newbury, Berks., on December 4.","Jena Pang takes teddy bears on holiday and to dinner .

"Happy again: Wendy looksforward to every day now . My 30th birthday was a milestone in many ways. For the first time in my life, I could say I had everything I’d ever wanted — a nice boyfriend, a great job, steady money and a place to call my own in London. But I did not feel happy. The gloom that had hung over me for as long as I could remember stubbornly refused to budge, even in the face of all of this good fortune. What I know now is that I would never have felt glad to be alive, no matter how much I had to be thankful for and would never have known what it is to feel joy — if I hadn’t started taking antidepressants. And that is why, no matter what happens, I will never turn my back on my ‘happy’ pills. Criticise me all you like, but I now accept my depression is an illness and know it would return again if I ever stopped taking them. I am speaking out because I want people to realise depression is as debilitating as many physical conditions. And successful people, people who seem to have everything, people in the public eye, can suffer from it, too. My only regret is that it took me until the age of 30 to realise there was something medically wrong. You would never have known it to look at me, but I didn’t care if I lived or died. I’d felt that way since my teens. The joy of life was totally lost on me. There was not a day when I did not wake up and wonder what the point of it all was. Yet I believed, as many do, that only those with a reason to feel low could, or should, feel low. My early childhood was happy. I grew up with my older sisters Anthea (yes, TV’s Anthea Turner) and Ruth at our home in Stoke-on-Trent. But everything changed when Ruth died. Born with spina bifida, she was never expected to reach a ripe old age. But her death, from sudden kidney failure in the summer of 1978 when she was 15 and I was 11, was completely unexpected. As a family we had no idea how to react or recover. From that moment on, life changed for ever; we all became different people, consumed, in our different ways, by shock and grief. I told myself that to show my own grief would only add to everyone else’s burden. So I bottled it up. For weeks, I went to school and pretended nothing had happened. I imagined Ruth was still alive. And, if friends asked after her, I’d say she was fine. I couldn’t face the truth. It was easier not to. I’m not sure how the truth eventually came out. My teachers had a quiet word with my friends, perhaps. All I know is, I never spoke to anyone about it. They say some people are born with a predisposition to depression, for others it is triggered by circumstances. It’s hard to know whether I was always destined to suffer from it, but I do know Ruth’s death changed me. I began my teenage years feeling numb and reckless, and I was looking for the chance to stick two fingers up at the world. That chance came when I met David. While I was 17, he was a 32-year-old divorcé. What could possibly go wrong? We met at a local radio station in Stoke-on-Trent where I did work experience after school and he was an engineer. To the horror of everyone who knew me I fell into his arms, pleased to have found the love of my life — and a way to rebel. Rising numbers: According to the latest NHS data, there has been an almost 25 per cent increase in prescriptions for antidepressants since 2010 in the UK . Unsurprisingly, my parents, Jean, a retired teacher, and Brian, who owned a soft-furnishings business, were worried sick. But they knew any attempt to pull me and David apart would only force us closer together. God knows how they restrained themselves when I announced we were to marry. But by the time the wedding came round — a traditional church affair — I was in a terrible situation from which I felt incapable of escaping. We’d been together for 18 months by then and David had become abusive, physically and psychologically. He hit me, kicked me, threatened to knife our dog if I left him. He chipped away at my self-esteem, exploiting insecurities any naïve, young girl would have. I wasn’t good enough; I wasn’t attractive enough; I didn’t deserve him. I was completely isolated, living in a different world to my friends. I thought it would feel wonderful to be a grown-up, but I was never more than a helpless child. When, at 19, I walked down the aisle on my father’s arm — dressed in white — I had lost myself and hated David for it. New beginnings: Wendy says that had it not been for her medication she would have never found love again or remarried . But it wasn’t until he choked me almost to death in a Bangkok hotel room four years later that I finally saw the light. Perhaps we both did. When we got home, he left me for his secretary and my family were waiting with open arms. Through these troubled years, it was hard to gauge the state of my mental health. I wasn’t happy and couldn’t remember the last time I had been, but there were reasons for it. Excuses. So it was fortunate that on my 30th birthday, with my disastrous marriage six years behind me, I was in a position to take stock and see clearly, for the first time, that while troubles had come and gone, depression had remained. Often, particularly when a celebrity speaks out about depression, people scoff, saying: ‘What on earth does SHE have to feel depressed about?’ or ‘If that’s what depression looks like, I’ll take it!’ But that perpetuates a very dangerous idea: that only people with terrible lives have a right to feel terrible, and everyone else is merely ungrateful. According to the latest NHS data, there has been an almost 25 per cent increase in prescriptions for antidepressants since 2010 in the UK. But instead of seeing this as welcome evidence that people are seeking treatment in greater numbers, many respond with head-shaking and hand-wringing. But those who see a doctor and accept a prescription should be commended for their courage, not criticised for being too lazy, too self-centred, or too defeatist to buck up and get on with it like everyone else. If they were diabetics we wouldn’t chastise them for taking insulin. If they had an infection, we’d expect them to take antibiotics. Yet people with depression are under constant pressure to avoid medication that could make all the difference to their lives — or come off it as soon as possible. Well, not me. Soon after that landmark birthday, I made a long-overdue appointment with my doctor, and told him exactly how I felt; that I couldn’t remember a time when I’d cared if I woke up the next day or not and longed to feel as happy as I looked. He sent me for psychiatric evaluation and, after several sessions, it was concluded I’d been suffering from clinical depression for the whole of my adult life. The next step was a prescription for anti-depressant Sertraline. Despite warnings I was likely to feel worse before I felt better, I couldn’t wait to start them. With hindsight, it wasn’t wise to begin at the same time as my new job, presenting Pet Rescue on Channel 4. After a week of filming, I called my doctor, feeling worse than ever. ‘You mustn’t stop taking them,’ he said. ‘You’ll be out of the tunnel before you know it.’ On day 14, I woke to my own personal miracle. From the moment my eyes opened, I knew I felt different. Happy, but not in a false or extreme way; for perhaps the first time since my sister died I was just happy to be here. My mind and body were in sync at last. When I smiled, I meant it. When I went to bed at night, I fell quickly and soundly asleep, looking forward to the next day. My only regret was not having done something sooner. It’s impossible to fathom the difference these little pills have made to my life. Without the steady sense of wellbeing they have given me, I suspect I would never have fallen in love or married again. Six months after I started them, I met and fell in love with my husband, actor Gary Webster, while performing in panto. I was no longer ambivalent about my future — instead I looked forward to building a life with Gary and growing old together. I have never missed a pill all of our time together. Even when I was expecting our boys, Jack and Freddie, now 15 and 11. I took them every day, believing giving them up was a greater risk than continuing with them. There is no data regarding the risks of taking antidepressants in pregnancy, although they have been linked with potential complications such as a higher risk of miscarriage and heart defects. I’m proud to say I plan to take antidepressants until my dying day. I only hope that, by speaking up, I might convince others they don’t have to live with depression.

"Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas called for clearer rules to prevent major trials being heard entirely in secret . Defendants should 'never, ever' be allowed to remain anonymous during their trial, the Lord Chief Justice warned today. Lord Thomas, the most senior judge in England and Wales, called for clearer rules to prevent major trials being heard entirely in secret. His warning that 'justice that is not open, is not good justice', comes as British law student Erol Incedal, who is accused of targeting former prime minister Tony Blair, faces retrial after a jury was discharged in the UK's first part-secret terror trial. Incedal was formerly known in the court case as AB and his co-defendant Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, 26, who admitted possessing a bomb-making document, as CD. The exceptional and controversial arrangements for the secret trial were made after a media challenge at the High Court against the entire case being heard in secret on grounds of national security. As well as opening up the case to partial reporting, it led to the defendants being named in public for the first time. Speaking at his annual press conference, the Lord Chief Justice said: 'We ought to have much clearer rules as to what we need - much clearer guidance. 'This is something that should be looked at and looked at properly. 'My experience of the intelligence services is actually that when you make a full explanation of what are the principles of open justice they actually believe it - not as much - but they do believe in it. 'We need to get the ground rules straight. We can not have something like this in my view happen again.' Lord Thomas went on: 'What we don't want in my view is a situation where you have anonymous defendants and that the matter has to come to the Court of Appeal to resolve it. 'There ought to be very much clearer guidelines and rules so that the prospect of an anonymous defendant is one that I hope we would never, ever see again in our courts.' Erol Incedal, (centre) who is accused of targeting former prime minister Tony Blair, faces retrial after a jury was discharged in the UK's first part-secret terror trial. Incedal was formerly known in the court case as AB . Lord Thomas said the press 'at the earliest possible stage' should be entitled to make representations and see as much material as can be shown'. He added: 'I really passionately believe in open justice. Justice that is not open, is not good justice. 'There may be wholly exceptional reasons why you can't say very much more than what someone is charged with. 'But I think anonymity and the nature of the charge, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances that could ever arise.' The Lord Chief Justice said in cases where some secrecy was required - the reasoning must be explained openly and clearly. 'You need to be very clear, if something is secret, why is it? What's the rationale? One has to do that openly.'","Lord Thomas calls for clearer rules to prevent major trials in secret .

"National treasure: But Delia Smith was once fired from the BBC because her show wasn't sexy enough . Delia Smith is one of the best-known faces on television after forging a pioneering career as the woman who inspired Britain to cook. But 30 years ago, she was kicked off TV screens by BBC managers who though she was 'not sexy enough', she revealed this week. Bosses thought her show was too 'educational' - but Delia went on to even greater success, and now says the axing was 'the best thing that ever happened to me'. The 71-year-old chef, whose empire of cookbooks, TV programmes and now online broadcasting has made her a national icon, was given a special Bafta award for her services to television cookery. At the award ceremony on Tuesday night, Delia recalled that despite her stellar career, not every enterprise has been a total success. In the 1980s, she made a number of programmes on BBC1 showcasing modern cooking techniques and encourage Britons to get into the kitchen. 'They sensed it was popular and put me at the end of Nationwide, which had millions of viewers,' she said, according to the Daily Mirror. 'But when that ended, many millions switched off.' The show was moved to BBC2 - but when a new controller took over, he apparently decided that it was too dry, and deemed that Delia was not exciting enough. She said he told her: 'I don't think this is sexy enough. I don't think it belongs on my channel. I think it should go to education.' While this could have been a blow to the chef's burgeoning popularity, she told the gathering this week: 'That was the best thing that ever happened to me.' Scroll down for video . Starting out: Delia during the start of her career as a popular television chef in the 1970s . Revolutionary: Delia was one of the first really popular television chefs, starting a trend which has continued . Delia added: 'Apparently I was not sexy enough. I suppose it was a blow, but you can't be everything can you?' The future star worked as a swimsuit model in the 1960s before starting a job as a waitress at a restaurant in Paddington, where she was eventually allowed to help with the cooking. She landed a newspaper cookery column in 1969, which brought her to the attention of TV executives. Delia made it her mission to teach Britain how to cook again, appearing on a number of BBC programmes before being given her own show. Back to basics: The chef presented How to Cook, pictured, in the late 1990s and early 2000s . In the 1990s, she made a string of blockbuster shows in which she recommended ingredients such as eggs and cranberries, which promptly saw massive spikes in their sales. Earlier this year, she announced she had retired from the television and has set up the 'Delia Online Cookery School', which enables would-be chefs to learn at their own pace using recipes and videos posted on her website. 'My online cookery school is the most amazing experience I've had,' she told the Bafta ceremony on Tuesday. 'We show exactly what we want to show. 'There is no better way to teach. When I have done this I will stop, as it will be done for ever.' Fan: The star is a majority shareholder in her beloved local football club Norwich City . She also said that the best part of her job was interacting with her legions of fans, adding: 'I think the most rewarding and satisfying thing is meeting the people who use the recipes, reading their letters - well, now their emails - but that's always rewarding when you realise you are actually reaching people through this wonderful medium called television.' Outside the kitchen, Delia is known as a passionate supporter of Norwich City, of which she and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones are the majority shareholders. However, at the ceremony she insisted she was not 'a recognisable face' despite her high profile. 'I'm very lucky because when I'm all dolled up like now, people might recognise me, but most of the time, without my make-up on, I'm a bit of a scruff and I don't get recognised,' she said.","TV chef, 71, is one of Britain's most popular onscreen presences .

"A police force has backtracked and named a retired police officer charged with a £113,000 theft after coming under fire for refusing to do so on policy grounds. Warwickshire Police performed a U-turn less than 24 hours after claiming their rules had changed in the wake of the Leveson inquiry, and revealed Paul Andrew Greaves, 54, was the subject of the allegations. A short footnote at the bottom of the press release revealing the charging decision said: ‘Due to a change in policy we no longer release the name of an individual on charge.’ U-turn: Warwickshire Police initially refused to name Paul Andrew Greaves, 54, from Stratford-upon-Avon, after he was charged with a £113k theft from the force's former headquarters . But the force were today slapped down by the Association of Chief Police Officers and their own deputy commissioner. Greaves was named by the Crown Prosecution Service and police were forced into a humiliating backtrack. It is a long-standing convention for police to name those they charge with an offence. Until recently, they . would also routinely name anyone they had arrested if asked. But . following the Leveson report into Press standards, forces have begun . rolling back the public’s right to know who is being arrested. Chief Constable Andy Trotter, who . leads for Acpo on media issues, said today that suspects should be named once charged. 'We advise forces, working with . the Crown Prosecution Service, to name those who have been charged and . that position will not change,' he said. 'When an individual has been arrested . our current guidance is not to name them and we will only release the . name for the prevention or detection of crime, or if there is a serious . public interest.' Lord Justice Leveson's report called for a ban on the Press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested . To the horror of free speech . campaigners, senior officers have drawn up plans which would ban the . Press and public being told the identity of anyone arrested. Lord . Justice Leveson’s report called for a ban on the Press or public being . told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested. However, . the refusal to name a suspect who has been charged and may already be . in police custody goes a significant step further in wrapping the . judicial system in a cloak of secrecy. The . naming of suspects who have been charged with criminal offences – and . who will stand trial in court –  is widely seen as an essential bulwark . against arbitrary arrest and detention. 'We advise forces, working with . the Crown Prosecution Service, to name those who have been charged and . that position will not change' - Acpo statement after Warwickshire Police refused to name the suspect . Eric Wood, Warwickshire's Deputy . Police and Crime Commissioner, said that it was in the public interest . for the suspect to be named. 'Warwickshire Police has a reputation . for being an open and transparent organisation and I am extremely . disappointed at what has transpired in the last 24 hours,' he said. 'I was very surprised to hear about . this sudden change of policy yesterday evening, and immediately . contacted Deputy Chief Constable Neil Brunton on behalf of the . Commissioner to discuss our concerns. We have since had a number of . robust conversations. 'Both the Commissioner and I firmly . believe that it is in the public interest that this individual is named. He is charged with a serious offence. 'The Commissioner is demanding a full . and frank report on all of the circumstances that led to this decision, . and we will be seeking assurances that in future all national . guidelines are adhered to. 'We are committed to ensuring that . Warwickshire Police operate in an open and transparent manner, and that . lessons have been learned from the mistakes of the last 24 hours.' Last night the Warwickshire force’s acting deputy chief constable Neil Brunton defended their policy. But today the force issued a statement admitting that they were wrong and named Greaves. 'As a result of concerns raised after publication of a press release regarding a man charged with theft, we accept that our decision not to name him was wrong and inconsistent with the current national guidance,' it read. 'We will now be adopting the national ACPO guidance in respect to naming individuals on charge. We apologise that our previous approach has not been consistent with this. 'Paul Andrew Greaves, a 54-year-old retired police officer, has been charged with the theft of £113,000 from the former Warwickshire Police headquarters at Leek Wootton.'","Warwickshire Police refused to name former officer charged with theft .

"Scroll down for video . Venetians have voted overwhelmingly for their own sovereign state in a ‘referendum’ on independence from Italy. Inspired by Scotland’s separatist ambitions, 89 per cent of the residents of the lagoon city and its surrounding area, opted to break away from Italy in an unofficial ballot. The proposed ‘Repubblica Veneta’ would include the five million inhabitants of the Veneto region and could later expand to include parts of Lombardy, Trentino and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Residents of Venice have voted 89 per cent to leave Italy and become an independent state in protest at high taxes levied on the wealthy in order to prop up the poor and crime ridden Mezzogiorno south . The floating city has only been part of Italy for 150 years. The 1000 year–old democratic Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia, was quashed by Napoleon and was subsumed into Italy in 1866. Wealthy Venetians, under mounting financial pressure in the economic crisis, have rallied in their thousands, after growing tired of supporting Italy’s poor and crime ridden Mezzogiorno south, through high taxation. Activists have been working closely with the SNP on their joint agendas, even travelling to Scotland alongside Catalonians and Basque separatists to take part in pro independence rallies. Campaigners say that the Rome government receives around 71 billion euros  each year in tax from Venice - some 21 billion euros less than it gets back in investment and services. Organisers said that 2.36million, 73 per cent, of those eligible to take part voted in the poll, which is not recognised by the Rome government. The ballot also appointed a committee of ten who immediately declared independence from Italy. Venice may now start withholding taxes from Rome. Independence campaigners have taken inspiration from the SNP and have visited political rallies in Scotland along with Catalonians and Basque separatists . Campaigner Paolo Bernardini, professor of European history at the University of Insubria in Como, northern Italy, said it was ‘high time’ for Venice to become an autonomous state once again. ‘Although history never repeats itself, we are now experiencing a strong return of little nations, small and prosperous countries, able to interact among each other in the global world.’ ‘The Venetian people realized that we are a nation (worthy of) self-rule and openly oppressed, and the entire world is moving towards fragmentation - a positive fragmentation - where local traditions mingle with global exchanges.’ President of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, of the separatist Northern League party, said that Venetians had lost 85,000 jobs in the crisis and were now’ hungry’ for change: ‘The will for secession is growing ever stronger . 'We are only at the Big Bang of the movement - but revolutions are born of hunger and we are now hungry. Venice can now escape.’ The five-day poll came in the same week that Crimean residents chose in a landslide vote to leave Ukraine and become part of Russia.","Wealthy residents are opposing high taxes which support poorer south .

"North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has been photographed visiting yet another orphanage - just days after reports he executed six more high-ranking government officials. The enigmatic leader was pictured looking jubilant as he toured the newly-completed Pyongyang Baby Home and Orphanage in the country's capital city today. Kim walked around the vibrantly-coloured building inspecting pink bunk beds and children's playrooms while his entourage of uniform-clad note-takers smiled approvingly. Soft side: Kim smiles during a visit to the newly-completed Pyongyang Baby Home and Orphanage . At one point during the tour Kim, who now uses a cane to help him walk, appeared to stop for a rest - perching on the edge of a ball pit in an indoor playground filled with trampolines. It is not the first time the dictator has displayed his softer side through state media. In June, he was pictured kneeling down to play with a classroom full of youngsters and in February he was seen holding a crying toddler in his arms - both during trips to orphanages in the capital. The leader’s health and grip on the nation was recently questioned after he disappeared from local media reports for more than 40 days. However, Kim has quelled the rumours of ill-health and unrest by being shown on state media visiting military facilities and construction sites. Playful: The secretive country's dictator perches on the edge of a ball pit surrounded by his smiling entourage . Inspection: The leader appeared to approve of the sleeping facilities at the orphanage in the capital city . Now speculation is now growing that the leader may have actually used his time away to oversee another government purge, after executing his uncle and other officials last year. South Korean media reported that six officials - including the the minister of posts and telecommunications, the commanding officer of North Korea's air force and a key official in the North's sport programmes - have not been present at a series of important events in recent months. An intelligence source told South Korea's renowned JoongAng Ilbo newspaper that 'six minister-level officials were executed'. If true, it would be the third major purge since the dictator Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011. Return: Kim made his first public appearance in 40 days two weeks ago following rumours that he was suffering ill health . Yesterday, South Korean activists, led by North Korean defectors, launched balloons to send 20,000 leaflets to North Korea with messages critical of its leader. The group had been warned against the action by South Korean officials after Pyongyang threatened unspecified 'military action' if the launch were to be allowed. On Saturday, the North's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper repeated a warning that inter-Korea ties will forever collapse if the South Korean government continued to allow the leaflet campaign, which it called 'an act of war'. The propaganda printed on the leaflets infuriates Pyongyang and has threatened to derail talks agreed between the two Koreas after the North sent a high-level delegation earlier this month, which was seen as its biggest peace overture in years.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has delivered his seal of approval to John Guidetti and insisted the striker deserves to be back in the Sweden squad. The Paris St Germain superstar took a verbal swipe at Guidetti last year when he suggested the 22-year-old should do more on the pitch and less talking to the media. Now, however, Ibrahimovic admits the on-loan Celtic forward has stepped up to the mark with nine goals in 10 games since moving north from Manchester City. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ibrahimovic and Guidetti on fire in front of goal . Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has heaped praise on his compatriot John Guidetti (above) Asked about Guidetti’s form in Scotland, he joked: ‘Good, very good. Does that mean he has listened? ‘He has played, made many goals and it’s good that he lets his feet speak. That’s the way he should go on, let your feet speak for themselves. You just have to continue. ‘The doors have always been open, and it’s about how you are performing in your club team. It’s all about how you perform in your club team. ‘John has done so wonderfully well in the Under 21s. That’s how he should go on.’ Guidetti now hopes to get the chance to link with Ibrahimovic in Sweden’s forthcoming games against Montenegro and France. Despite the past criticism sent in his direction, Guidetti regards his national captain as an inspiration. ‘I don’t know him really well,’ he said. ‘We’re not buddies who go out for coffee. Ibrahimovic revealed he is pleased that Swedish team-mate Guidetti 'lets his feet speak' ‘But he is an amazing player and probably the best Sweden has ever had. ‘He is our captain and someone we respect on and off the pitch. Of course, he is someone you look up to and strive to be like. ‘Is he better than Henrik Larsson? I don’t know, it’s tight. I think Henrik was unbelievable but Zlatan is hard to beat in Sweden. ‘He has his own stamp, his own word in the dictionary. He is pretty big... ‘I have read his book. It’s one of the few books I have read. It’s the only book I’ve read! ‘It’s a great story, a great book to read. He is a great character in Swedish football. ‘As I said, I don’t really hang out with him but he has been alright with me. He has been cool. Guidetti has been in sensational form for Celtic, scoring nine goals in 10 games . ‘We play the same position so he is always good talking to you. ‘Will I ever write a book like Zlatan? I will have to go and train harder if I want to do that because I have a lot to live up to! ‘I don’t know, I just try to stay in the present and work hard. I think a book is far away.’ Deference doesn’t come easy to Guidetti and he insisted he doesn’t change his demeanour when Ibrahimovic is around. ‘I’m always myself,’ he said. ‘If you try to walk through life always trying to change for other people then you will have nothing to do other than be an absolute schizophrenic. You will be trying to be someone else all the time. ‘You just have to be yourself. If someone doesn’t like you then at the end of the day that is their problem, not your problem. You can only be who you are and I have been the same person since I grew up, really. I was a cocky little s**t when I was three and I’m a cocky little s**t now. The Celtic striker believes Ibrahimovic is 'probably the best striker Sweden has ever had' ‘It’s just me. Either you love me or you hate me but I am always going to be myself. ‘I do it with a good heart. I try to do it with love.’ Guidetti’s prolific loan spell with Feyenoord aged 19 saw the Swedish media tag him as the next Ibrahimovic. Yet his progress was stalled – and his career placed in doubt – following a virus which attacked his nervous system following a bout of food poisoning. It is only now, at Parkhead, that he is back in regular football and trying to live up to the expectations of his homeland. ‘I don’t know if it’s pressure,’ he said. ‘People will always say or write that I’m destroying my career, that I’m injured and asking why is he staying at Manchester City, blah, blah, blah. ‘I don’t want to be injured. It’s not that I don’t want to play football. Football is the best thing in the world. It’s what I enjoy the most. Guidetti (left) cheekily celebrates a team-mate's goal during a Sweden Under 21 match last month . ‘Sometimes people on the outside don’t understand the whole story. They have to understand that any footballer wants to play football, that he doesn’t want to be injured. ‘I couldn’t stop injuries and I always try and do my best. I’ll keep doing that and hope it goes well. ‘Being called by Sweden is a bonus. It’s an honour to be called up for your country of course. But we have done such great things with the under 21s that we have things to look forward to there. ‘We play the Euro Finals next summer and the first team was not in my mind. I’ve been there before and it’s great to be back but, as I say, it’s more of a bonus.’","Zlatan Ibrahimovic is pleased John Guidetti is in Sweden squad .

"A four-year-old girl has been mauled to death by a 'monster' pit bull while she was watching TV at home with her mom. Little Mia Derouen was pounced on by the 130lb dog, one of two at the home in the Houma Highland Apartments in Houma, Louisiana, and died in hospital from her injuries, according to Houma Police Chief Todd Duplantis. Police officers were called to the apartment complex around 7 p.m. Tuesday by the girl's mother, Megan Touchet, who was also injured as she desperately fought the crazed dog off her child. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Four-year-old Mia Derouen, pictured, was mauled to death by her family's dog . Birthday: Mia was due to turn five the week after the attack on March 25 . 'The mother was able to get away from the pit bull and barricade herself in a bedroom where she screamed for help and handed over her 4-year-old child through a window to medical personnel,' Duplantis said in a statement. According to police, the attack happened inside the family home. 'She was screaming for help,' Duplantis said of the desperate mother's 911 call. Mia suffered facial and head injuries in the pit bull attack and was rushed to Terrebonne General Medical Center but didn't make it. Touchet suffered moderate injuries and was hospitalized as well. She remains in hospital today. Duplantis did not know whether the girl was on a sofa or chair or on the floor when she was attacked. Vicious attack: Mia, pictured with her dad Chris, was pounced on by the dog, one of two at her mom's home in the Houma Highland Apartments . The animal, named Niko, was shot dead by police before they were able to enter the apartment. Duplantis described it as 'a monster,' in a Wednesday afternoon press conference. They reported that it was 'running loose inside the apartment acting in a very vicious manner' and officers shot it three times to 'eliminate the threat of additional injuries.' 'It's a traumatic event,' said Terrebonne Parish President Michel Claudet told WWLTV.com Wednesday. Mia would have celebrated her fifth birthday next week. Her father, Chris Derouen, took to Facebook to beg for a miracle as his daughter fought for life in hospital. Frantic call: Police officers were called to the complex around 7 p.m. by the girl's mother, Megan Touchet, who was also injured as the fought the crazed dog off her child . Prayers: Her father, Chris Derouen, picured, took to Facebook to beg for a miracle as his daughter fought for life in hospital. She later died . 'Please I need prayers,' he wrote. 'My daughter was attacked by a pitbull and they don't know if she will make it....please God...I need this miracle.' After she passed away he covered his wall with pictures of the two of them, and friends and family expressed their sympathies. Claudet said the family had another pit bull. 'They had two pit bulls, and one was over 100 pounds,' he said, adding that this larger dog was the one that attacked Mia. 'Unfortunately, that's what happened and it's such a horrific event,' he said. The second pit bull was taken away by animal control officers, police said. Duplantis described the scene as 'horrific' and said counseling was being offered to the officers who were on the scene. It's not clear if charges will be filed in the case, which is still being investigated. The families have set up a gofundme page to raise money for the child's funeral expenses.","Mia Derouen was attacked by the dog, one of two at the home in Houma, Louisiana, Tuesday night and died in hospital from her injuries .

"The girlfriend who has stood by Ched Evans yesterday insisted he was innocent of rape – and pledged to support his bid to resume his football career when he is released from prison. Natasha Massey spoke out after Judy Finnigan sparked a storm of outrage by saying his attack on a 19-year-old woman was ‘not violent’ and pointing out the victim had ‘had far too much to drink’. Millionaire’s daughter Miss Massey insisted the only thing Evans had done wrong was to cheat on her, saying she had never doubted that he was innocent of rape despite the victim telling police she had no memory of having sex with him. Just days before the former Sheffield United striker is due to be released, his sister Kylie and Miss Massey appeared on This Morning. Scroll down for video . Ched Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey has insisted she will stand by her footballer boyfriend once he is released from prison this week . Miss Massey’s father Karl, who owns several companies including a jewellers in Wilmslow, Cheshire, has bankrolled a high-profile campaign proclaiming Evans’ innocence including a website and newspaper adverts. He has also hired former detective Russ Whitfield, who runs a private investigations firm, and a legal team including specialist appeals barrister David Emanuel who have handed new evidence to the Criminal Cases Review Commission hoping it will re-examine Evans’ conviction. Interviewed on the ITV programme by Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden – accompanied by the caption ‘I’m standing by my rapist boyfriend’ – Miss Massey, 25, said she had visited him every week since he was jailed in 2012. The beauty therapist – who had been going out with the £20,000-a-week star for two years before the attack – said it had been ‘heartbreaking’ to learn he had cheated on her but that she had never doubted he was innocent of rape. ‘As soon as I found out that he’d been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him,’ she said. ‘So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time. ‘I know Ched and I knew he wouldn’t be capable of committing a crime like that.’ Appearing alongside Natasha was Ched's sister Kylie, right, who also defended her brother, pictured, right, with Natasha . Ched Evans, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman . Miss Massey admitted the only day of his trial that she had attended was when the jury returned their verdicts, but insisted that ‘I knew the facts way before the jury, way before the public’. After the shock of seeing him jailed, she told the programme she had no doubts about standing by him. ‘It was difficult at first. I never dreamed that Ched would be sent to prison,’ she said. ‘But straight away I got a message to him to say that I was standing by him and that everything will be OK … at first it was difficult, but then you adapt.’ Earlier this year she gave a newspaper interview telling of her intention to marry Evans after his release, and yesterday she said that while she did not know what the future held, she knows he hopes to play professional football again. ‘It’s out of our hands,’ she said. ‘We don’t know about Ched’s football – I’m just his partner, I don’t get involved in the football side – but I do know that Ched would love to return to football and continue doing what he knows best and what he loves.’ The case has become headline news once again after presenter Judy Finnigan sparked fury by suggesting Evans should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was ‘drunk’ and the rape was ‘unpleasant’ but ‘not violent’ She also claimed that many people who had signed the petition calling for him to be barred from football had subsequently contacted her saying they had changed their minds after reading about the case on the campaign website. Also on the show, Evans’ sister recalled the ‘shocking’ moment the jury found him guilty, saying: ‘I was in court every day and I have no idea how they came to that conclusion.’ She added that ‘just because 12 people found him guilty, people should not necessarily listen to them’. Later Miss Massey declined to comment to the Daily Mail about Miss Finnigan’s remarks, saying: ‘I don’t see what purpose it would serve.’","Evans, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19-year-old woman .

"The RFU have launched an investigation into allegations that Welsh referee Nigel Owens was subjected to homophobic abuse by a small section of the Twickenham crowd during England’s loss to New Zealand on Saturday. A claim was made on Wednesday that Owens, who came out in 2007, was subjected to ‘disgusting vitriol’ by one member of the crowd and the sport’s governing body has promised to investigate. A spokesman said: ‘The RFU condemns all forms of discrimination and aims to ensure that all people, irrespective of their age, gender, ability, race, religion, ethnic origin, creed, colour, nationality, social status or sexual orientation, have a genuine and equal opportunity to enjoy rugby union in whatever form, on or off the pitch, at all levels and in all roles. Referee Nigel Owens (left) is one of only a handful of openly homosexual people in rugby . 'As a lifelong rugby fan, a straight man in his 60s, I could not believe that a bunch of men half my age watching a rugby match in the 21st century could be capable of hurling such nasty, foul-mouthed, racist, homophobic abuse at an openly gay match official,' Keith Wilson, from South Yorkshire, wrote in a letter to The Guardian on Wednesday. 'My equally disgusted son is in his 30s but next to him, hearing this vitriol, was a little boy. 'I felt ashamed.' ‘We take any allegations of any abuse very seriously and are investigating this matter.’ A national newspaper received a letter of complaint regarding an individual’s behaviour during the game in which the fellow spectator complained about abuse directed at Owens, who considered suicide as a young man before coming out. Owens said: ‘If someone has gone to the trouble to send a letter to the paper and say that this was disgusting and the behaviour was totally out of order, then I would think what they shouted was pretty bad and if that is the case then these people should be banned from the game. ‘They need to be told that some behaviour is not acceptable, that crossing the line of what is humour and banter is a fine line but if you cross it then you have to put up with the consequences.’ Owens, a role model for the gay community as one of only a handful of openly homosexual people in rugby, is widely considered to be one of the world’s best referees. He added: ‘What has become more evident is that while we may not be so aware of it on the field, I think we become more aware of it now through social media. The Welsh official is widely considered to be one of the world’s best referees . ‘When you see things that are tweeted by so-called rugby supporters about opposition teams and some of the tweets that I have had, you begin thinking, “Bloody hell, are these type of people really in our game?” ‘I have had homophobic tweets and messages on Facebook from people who are shouting things that I could not repeat in your newspaper. ‘It is creeping into the game and some of the tweets I have had are pretty nasty, really. ‘Sometimes you get these comments and read these tweets and you think, “Do I really need this? Do I really need to do this job?” ‘It does get you down and I honestly feel sometimes like saying: ‘Enough is enough, I will walk away from it all.’ Owens has vowed to carry on and will take charge of France against Australia this weekend . ‘But then you get support from people and it makes you realise these are the minority and you have to pick yourself up and rise above it. It is not always easy to do that but you have to do it and get on. ‘I don’t think it is a huge problem in rugby but I think it is an increasing problem as last Saturday has proved. ‘People have said when I came out I would be a role model to young people who are dealing with becoming who they are within rugby and other sports and I understand that now. ‘But the people who do more good are not myself but are the people like Keith Wilson (who highlighted the abuse in a letter to the media) who stood up to these louts. ‘They are the true, genuine rugby people who can make a difference more than I can. A fan sparked the RFU probe by claiming he was 'ashamed' at the abuse aimed at Owens . ‘I’d be lying if I said it didn’t affect me — you get disappointed and down when you see it. It gets to you but you have to go out there and prove them wrong. It’s about showing your character. You want to show them they won’t push you out of the game you adore. ‘We are only human and when people say horrible things about you, it gets in your mind. ‘But it’s also about setting an example to those coming through the system. You want to show them you stood up for yourself and got through it. ‘I couldn’t go out and do my job as a referee if comments made by fans or anyone else got to me. I’ve had it since I started as a referee, but for a player it’s different. ‘They’re not used to putting up with that stuff from supporters — it’s totally unacceptable. I’ve had to take abuse as a referee and in my case it was a little different. ‘I’m refereeing France against Australia this weekend which is a massive game. And I need to stick two fingers up to those who shouted abuse at me. I need to go out there and prove them wrong.’ VIDEO O2 Inside Line, Season 5 - Episode 2 .

"William Clay Ford, the last surviving grandchild of automotive pioneer Henry Ford and owner of the Detroit Lions, has died. He was 88. Ford Motor Co. said in a statement on Sunday that Ford died of pneumonia at his home in Grosse Pointe, Mich. Ford helped steer the family business for more than five decades. He bought one of his own, the NFL franchise in the Motor City, a half-century ago. He served as an employee and board member of the automaker for more than half of its 100-year history. Scroll down for video . William Clay Ford Sr. the owner of the Detroit Lions, has died at the age of 88 today . 'My father was a great business leader and humanitarian who dedicated his life to the company and the community,' William Clay Ford Jr., executive chairman of Ford Motor Co. and Lions vice chairman, said in a statement. 'He also was a wonderful family man, a loving husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him, yet he will continue to inspire us all.' Ford was regarded as a dignified man by the select few who seemed to know him well. To the masses in Detroit, he was simply the owner of the Lions who struggled to achieve success on the field despite showing his passion for winning by spending money on free agents, coaches, executives and facilities. Ford's first full season leading the Lions was in 1964, seven years after the franchise won the NFL title. The lone playoff victory he enjoyed was in 1992. The Lions are the only team to go 0-16 in a season, hitting rock bottom in 2008. After an 11-year drought, the Lions improved enough to make the playoffs in 2011 only to lose a combined 21 games over the next two seasons. 'No owner loved his team more than Mr. Ford loved the Lions,' Lions President Tom Lewand said in a statement released by the team. 'Those of us who had the opportunity to work for Mr. Ford knew of his unyielding passion for his family, the Lions and the city of Detroit. His leadership, integrity, kindness, humility and good humor were matched only by his desire to bring a Super Bowl championship to the Lions and to our community. 'Each of us in the organization will continue to relentlessly pursue that goal in his honor.' Detroit Lions owner and chairman William Clay Ford, pictured here along the sidelines of a football game, was loved by all who knew him . Born into an automotive fortune in 1925 bearing what was already a household name, Ford was 23 when he joined the Ford Motor Co. board of directors in 1948, one year after the death of his grandfather, Henry Ford. He maintained as low a profile as his name would allow, serving on various executive committees and spearheading the design, development and introduction of the Continental Mark II in 1956. He was elected a Ford vice chairman in 1980 and retired with that title in 1989. Ford remained a company director until 2005, later taking the title of director emeritus. 'Mr. Ford had a profound impact on Ford Motor Company,' Ford CEO Alan Mulally said in a statement. 'The company extends its deepest sympathies to the many members of the extended Ford family at this difficult time. While we mourn Mr. Ford's death, we also are grateful for his many contributions to the company and the auto industry.' He helped institutionalize the practice of professional management atop the company that began with the naming of Philip Caldwell as Ford CEO in 1979 and as Ford chairman in March 1980, without relinquishing the Ford family's control. William Clay Ford Sr. was the last surviving grandson of Henry Ford, founder of Ford Motors . As a board member, Ford helped bring the company back under his family's control in 2001, when the directors ousted former CEO Jacques Nasser in favor of William Clay Ford Jr. The youngest of Edsel B. Ford's four children, Ford Sr. was first elected to the Ford Motor Co. board in June 1948. He rarely spoke publicly but was reflective during the company's centennial year in 2003. At the annual meeting, he told stories about his grandfather teaching him to drive at age 10, and of being taken for his first airplane ride in a Ford Tri-Motor by Charles Lindbergh. 'I just want you to know that we have tremendous pride in the Ford name,' he told the shareholders more than a decade ago. 'We have a spirit of working together, and we have a passion for cars. And we also have a great desire to see the Ford name in the forefront of world transportation.' Ford always kept the Lions close to his heart. He knew how much the team meant to people who lived in or grew up in Michigan. 'I think sports are a wonderful diversion,' Ford told The Detroit News in 1980. 'People can relate to sports very easily. It's a quick study.' But while each of the Motor City's other three professional franchises — the Red Wings, Pistons and Tigers — won at least one championship, the Lions were synonymous with losing under Ford. 'No owner loved his team more than Mr. Ford loved the Lions,' Lions President Tom Lewand said in a statement released by the team . He seemed to lead the Lions with a light touch, leaving most decisions up to administrators such as Russ Thomas, Chuck Schmidt, Matt Millen and current general manager Martin Mayhew. Even though the franchise rarely produced a successful product, the stands are usually filled with fans desperate to witness a winner. 'Detroit, and I'm not blowing smoke at anybody, is probably the greatest fan sports town in the country,' Ford told The News in 1980, the year after a 2-14 team set a franchise attendance record. 'They'll support anything.' Ford moved the club from Tiger Stadium in Detroit to the Pontiac Silverdome in 1975 before bringing his team back downtown. Ford Field — a spectacular 65,000-seat, $315 million indoor stadium — opened in 2002 that, coupled with a state-of-the-art team headquarters in nearby Allen Park, gave the Lions the best facilities money could buy. But a blueprint for consistently winning was elusive. From Ford's first season as team owner to his last, the Lions won 310 games, lost 441 and tied 13. Ford was married to the former Martha Parke Firestone, an heiress to the Akron, Ohio, rubber fortune. Her grandfather, Harvey Firestone, was a close friend of Henry Ford. They had three daughters, a son, 14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Funeral services will be private.","Ford Motor Co. said in a statement on Sunday that Ford died of pneumonia at his home in Grosse Pointe, Michigan .

Examinations also showed he was a young man, aged between . just 18 and 20 when he was killed, and impressively muscled. Mr Antoine said he believes a lack of defensive wounds . suggest Ginger was the victim of a surprise attack. A blade of copper or . sharpened flint at least 5in long and 0.7in wide made the injury, he said. The way that Ginger's shattered bones remained in the soft . tissue surrounding them indicates the injury took place while he was alive. Professor Anders Persson of the Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), a Forensic Radiology expert, who also uses the virtual autopsy system for criminal and accident cases in Sweden, confirmed the British Museum’s assessment that the force of the blow was such that it also shattered the rib immediately below the shoulder blade, embedding bone fragments into his muscle tissue, and injuring the left lung and surrounding blood vessels. The absence of any signs of healing and the severity of the injuries suggest that this can be considered the cause of death. The body, the London museum's most popular attraction after . the Rosetta Stone, has rarely been moved since first being put on display in . 1901. Forensic investigation: Scientists examined Ginger using a computer axial tomography (CAT) scanner, with just 30 seconds of scans giving them enough data for a detailed investigation of his insides . To carry out their . investigations, curators carried the mummy carefully on a duvet and . packed it into a van for the drive to Cromwell . Hospital in nearby Earl's Court. Forensic scientists examined Ginger using a computer axial . tomography (CAT) scanner, with just 30 seconds of scans giving them enough data . for a detailed investigation of his insides. The three-dimensional image created by the machine was than . imported into software developed by the Interactive Institute which allows . investigators to rotate, enlarge and virtually cut layers away. The late Neolithic period in Egypt is known as the Predynastic period. It began in the sixth millennium BC, and ended with the unification of Egypt, which marked the start of the historical period in Egypt. It is traditionally divided into two subgroups, called the Naqada I period (4000-3500 BC) and the Naqada II period (3500-3100 BC). Naqada was an important southern town where these periods were first distinguished in modern times. The inhabitants of Egypt first lived in settlements during the Predynastic period. Cemeteries were located in the low desert near the settlements, and the north and south of the country were culturally distinct. The south was administered from the city of Hierakonpolis, while the capital of the north was Buto. Burials at the time were simple pit graves, in which the corpse was laid in a crouched position and naurally dried by the hot sand. In later burials, the bodies were sometimes wrapped in mat, and the person's head and limbs bound with cloth. The objects placed in burials, such as items of jewellery, slate palettes and pots are the main sources of information about this time. Curators had not even seen the underside of the ancient . murder victim for 100 years, Dr Antoine told The Times, but now, using the . computer model, they can examine almost all his internal organs in detail. Further research could now be done to paint a picture of . Ginger's final few hours before his killer caught up with him. The British . Museum's team should be able to analyse his last meal, Dr Antoine said, and . even see what he ate in his last three months by an analysis of his hair and . fingernails. He added: 'Not only . have we been able to discover that Gebelein Man was young when he died . but, unexpectedly, the 3D visualisation of the CT scan has confirmed . that he was stabbed in the back. 'The analysis of . ancient human remains rarely reveals the cause of death but the cut on . his back, as well as the damage to the underlying shoulder blade and . rib, are characteristic of a single penetrating wound. 'The virtual . autopsy table has allowed us explore the CT scan data interactively and . clearly visualise his skeleton and internal organs, something that is . not always possible with other methods.' Ginger as he was originally displayed at the British Museum . A new display unveiled today based on the findings allows visitors to use a touch screen to look inside his body to see if there are any other clues about his life and death. Using the interactive touchscreen and the gesture based interface it is possible to strip away the skin to expose his skeleton, and make virtual slices to view his internal organs and his brain. David Hughes of the Interactive Institute said ‘This powerful visualisation system has enabled not just remarkable new revelations about one of the British Museum’s most iconic mummies, but also brings the thrill of discovery straight to the gallery for the public. 'Using exactly the same technology that the scientists use, visitors to the museum can now explore for themselves and, who knows, perhaps even make their own new discovery with the exhibit.’","Ginger, named for his red hair, was found to have been killed by a stab wound on his back after a 3D post-mortem using medical scans .

"Cat breeders have created a new type of kitty based on mythical elves and it is a dead ringer for Dobby from the Harry Potter films. Elf Cats, which sell for $2,000 (£1,245) each, are a cross between the American Curl, known for its curved ears and the hairless Sphynx. While cat fans have compared the animals to heartthrob Orlando Bloom's elf character Legolas from the Lord of the Rings films they perhaps bear a closer resemblance to ugly house elf Dobby from the Harry Potter series. Mythical moggies? The Elf Cat is a cross between the hairless Sphynx and the American Curl known for its twisted ears . Karen Nelson from the United States who created the breed wanted to combine the traits of the Sphynx and the American Curl to create a cat which is a sociable, affectionate and highly active. Karen, who suffers from cat allergies but is not affected by hairless types said: 'The Elf is full of energy and is docile and outgoing!'

"Andy Murray created a public relations storm two months ago with his pro-Scottish independence tweet and we wait to see if more fallout comes on Thursday night. For against him as he fights for his life at the Barclays ATP World Finals is Roger Federer, the player whose popularity transcends national boundaries, nowhere more so than in London. The last time these two met at the O2 Arena, in 2012, public fondness for Murray had been soaring, partly due to his brave and emotional bid for the Wimbledon title that year, and partly due to his contribution to Britain’s gold rush at the Olympics. Andy Murray shoots into a mini basketball hoop (left)   and stretches ahead of training (right) on Wednesday . Murray celebrates his win against Milos Raonic to get his ATP World Tour Finals campaign back on track . Afternoon - not before 2pm . Kei Nishikori v Milos Raonic . Evening - not before 8pm . Roger Federer v Andy Murray . All matches live on Sky Sports 3 . So it was something of a surprise to find that, despite all this, more than half the crowd that night supported the Swiss as he overcame the longtime London-based player with consummate ease. The atmosphere was not so much anti-Murray but pro-Federer. It is hard to overstate the gooey devotion that the Swiss inspires in tennis fans, and this event has become like a convention for him with hundreds of his compatriots adding to the general level of support. Crowd reaction will provide a fascinating subtext, especially as it is probable that by the time they play Federer will already have qualified for Saturday’s semi-finals with Murray still battling for a place. A host of permutations are possible at the start of play, when Milos Raonic takes on Kei Nishikori in the other group match, but by the evening things should be clearer. Federer is always the darling when he steps on court here, but Murray has also had a decent reception this week, especially when he beat Raonic to stay alive on Tuesday night. World No 2 Roger Federer will top Group B at the ATP World Tour Finals if he beats Murray on Thursday . VIDEO Final-specialist Federer not looking too far ahead . Kei Nishikori will give himself a good chance of qualifying for the semi-finals should he beat Raonic . Big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic could still qualify if he beats Nishikori in the afternoon session . Wins   Sets     Games . Federer       2-0      4-0      25-12 . Nishikori     1-1      2-2      17-20 . Murray        1-1      2-2      21-20 . Raonic         0-2      0-4      15-26 . The 27-year-old Scot fully expects many to support his opponent tonight but does not believe that will decide the match. ‘It is not the No 1 factor, that is what is happening on the tennis court,’ he said. ‘I have always said that if you have the crowd with you it helps. I am sure the crowd will be fairly split, they have been when I have played Roger in London before. He always gets great support wherever he goes.’ The one exception was the Olympic final, where Federer was taken aback by the patriotic fervour that swept the Union Jack-wearing player to the gold medal. ‘The atmosphere was amazing,’ said Murray. ‘I have played a lot of matches at Wimbledon but I have never experienced the Centre Court being like that.’ Many will dismiss the Scot’s abandonment of his previously determined neutrality on Scottish independence as irrelevant, and of course he was entitled to his view. However, with feelings running high there is no doubt that it dented his image with many, not to mention his commercial value. Yet it looks to have had a positive impact on his tennis, starting the week after it happened, at Shenzen in China. Murray has batted away the subject when asked but people who were around him that week say he was subdued and withdrawn, as if dazed by the stinging reaction. He explained to one that, while proud to be British, he would have struggled to live with himself if he had not expressed a preference on the issue, having only made up his mind late on. The whole episode seemed to galvanise the competitive instincts that had been missing this year until then. He subsequently won a series of close-fought matches, and that is the whole reason why he qualified for the top-eight event in London, where he can now make the last four. Murray looks to his supporters, including girlfriend Kim Sears (left) and coach Amelie Mauresmo (right) The British No 1 gets an enthusiastic cheer from his box as he wins in straight sets over Raonic . The contest is even more beguiling because he and Federer have a close personal rivalry that is politely cordial at best. ‘I haven’t spent loads of time with him,’ said Murray. ‘We never practise together but I have always chatted to him when I have seen him. We have never had any issues away from the court.’ Their career record is 11-11 but at the O2 Arena it is 3-0 to the Swiss, the supreme indoor player who also took control in their 2012 Wimbledon final once the roof was closed for rain. To try to simplify the mathematics, Murray’s hopes are best served by Raonic beating Nishikori, a distinct possibility given that the Japanese has had wrist problems. If that happens, Murray will go through with any kind of victory over Federer. But it won’t be easy and it will be in Federer’s interest to finish top of the group. ‘It can be a difficult proposition if you are going in thinking, “A ll I have to do is win a set”. That doesn’t help because we are not used to those situations,’ said Murray. ‘I’ve just got to go out thinking I have to beat Roger.’ US Open champion Marin Cilic became the first player to face almost certain elimination when he was crushed 6-3, 6-1 by Tomas Berdych as his form continued to unwind after winning at Flushing Meadows. With world No1 Novak Djokovic beating Stan Wawrinka 6-3, 6-0, there has still not been a decent singles contest. The opening eight singles matches have all been decided in straight sets, with the undercard doubles making more compelling viewing. Djokovic said: ‘Stan wasn’t close to his best and I succeeded very well.’","Andy Murray meets Roger Federer in their final Group B match at the O2 .

"Fly-half Dan Carter will start a Test for the first time in a year when the All Blacks play Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday. Carter is included in a New Zealand squad containing 12 changes to the 23 that edged England 24-21 last weekend. Captain Richie McCaw will play as a blindside flanker for the first time in his test career, allowing Sam Cane a rare chance on the openside flank. Dan Carter is set to return to the New Zealand starting XV for Saturday's international with Scotland . It will be the first time Carter has started for the All Blacks in a Test since the match with England last year . Richie McCaw is set to play as a blindside flanker for the first time in his Test career at Murrayfield .

Reserves: Dane Coles, Wyatt Crockett, Ben Franks, Luke Romano, Liam Messam, Augustine Pulu, Sonny Bill Williams, Julian Savea. James Parsons will make an unexpected Test debut after being called into the touring squad as a replacement for injured Nathan Harris. Carter last started a Test against England last November. He took the following seven months off and his planned return was set back when he broke his leg in the Super Rugby final. Carter came off the bench for the All Blacks against the United States but took no part in last weekend's Test at Twickenham. Saturday's match is likely to test whether he can pass Aaron Cruden and Beauden Barrett to reclaim his place as New Zealand's No 1 fly-half before next year's World Cup. Carter is the world's leading test scorer with 1,446 points but the match against Scotland will reveal whether he still has the sharpness to lead the All Blacks in major matches.

Perenara will start at scrum-half, combining with Carter, while Malakai Fekitoa and Ryan Crotty return in midfield where New Zealand's depth is strongest and competition for starting places is most fierce. Ben Smith moves to full-back, fuelling his rivalry with Israel Dagg for that starting role, while fly-half Colin Slade shows his versatility by being named on the wing. Colin Slade (right), seen here talking to Dr Tony Page in training, has been named on the wing . All Blacks coach Steve Hanson said the experimental nature of the All Blacks' line-up did not suggest they were taking Scotland lightly. 'There is an expectation that those who fill the jersey will deliver quality performances,' Hanson said. 'We have a lot of respect for the Scots and know that they will bring a lot of physicality. We also expect them to want to move the ball. That style certainly suited them last week and makes them, we believe, even more dangerous.' Meanwhile, Scotland forward Blair Cowan insists the All Blacks have not delivered a snub to his team by making 13 changes ahead of their trip to Murrayfield.

"Eating was a game of Russian roulette for Margo Wölk - because every mouthful of food could have killed her. Although grateful for the bland vegetarian meals she was given, the 25-year-old and her colleagues were not being fed out of generosity. Ms Wölk was one of 15 women employed at Adolf Hitler's Prussian headquarters during the Second World War to taste the Nazi leader's food to ensure it had not been poisoned. Adolf Hitler, pictured here eating with his mistress Eva Braun, employed 15 women to taste his food because he feared he might be poisoned . Margo Wölk said some of the women she worked with would cry through their meals because 'they were so afraid' they might die as a result . In an interview with Berlin's RBB television channel, the only surviving meal-tester who is now a 96-year-old widow, recalled how the women would burst into tears after each meal because they were grateful to still be alive. Because of 'constant rumors the British were out to poison Hitler', he never ate meat, and his meals would consist of rice, noodles, peppers, peas and cauliflower. Ms Wölk said of the experience: 'Some of the girls started to shed tears as they began eating because they were so afraid. We had to eat it all up. Then we had to wait an hour, and every time we were frightened that we were going to be ill. We used to cry like dogs because we were so glad to have survived.' Ms Wölk became a food taster by accident after taking refuge at her mother's Partsch home, which happened to be next door to Hitler's Wolf's Lair. She had been bombed out of her Berlin apartment in 1941 - after her husband Karl had been drafted into the army - and was forced by the mayor of the town to take-up the deadly job. Ms Wölk, now a 96-year-old widower, is the only surviving food taster and still lives in Berlin . Each day she was picked up by a guard and driven to a school building to test Hitler's food. Despite her position, Ms Wölk never saw Hitler. She was however, raped by one of his guards. Ms Wölk recalled an attempt on Hitler's life on 20 July 1944, when a group of German army officers tried to detonate a bomb inside his lair. 'We were held there and raped for 14 days. It was hell on earth. The nightmare never goes away' - Hitler's food taster Margo Wölk . She said: “We were sitting on wooden benches, and suddenly we heard and felt this incredible big bang. 'We fell off the benches and I heard someone shouting, ''Hitler is dead!'' But of course he wasn’t.' As a result of the assassination attempt, almost 5,000 Germans were executed by the Nazi's and Ms Wölk was moved to the another building, where he job continued. After being helped by an SS officer, Ms Wölk fled to Berlin in 1944. But the horror of the war didn't end there for Ms Wölk. Berlin capitulated to the Russian army in 1945, and her life took a turn for the worse. She told the German television programme: 'We tried to dress up as old women, but the Russians came for me and the other girls all the same.' She added: 'They cut open our dresses and dragged us into a doctor’s flat. We were held there and raped for 14 days. It was hell on earth. The nightmare never goes away.'Ms Wölk was left unable to bear children. 'I always wanted a daughter. When I reached 50, I thought, if had a daughter she would be 25 now. But sadly that never happened.' A British officer helped Ms Wölk recover and she awaited news of her husbands fate. He appeared at her doorstep in 1946, but nothing was the same again. Having being imprisoned in a war camp, he weighed just 45kgs and was barely recogniseable. Ms Wölk too struggled with nightmares and the pair later separated.","Margo Wölk became a food taster after moving in with her mother in 1941 .

"A Arizona judge Tuesday spared the life of a pit bull who mauled a 4-year-old boy last month and touched off a controversial debate on mercy, blame and animal violence. Municipal Court Judge Deborah Griffin ruled that the dog named Mickey must be neutered, defanged and microchipped. She declared the dog vicious earlier in the day and could have ordered euthanasia. 'There would be absolutely no possibility of the animal ever doing this to someone again,' Griffin said, adding that the dog must remain in a facility for the rest of his life and cannot be adopted. Scroll down for video . Spared: Mickey the pit bull who attacked four-year-old Kevin Vicente February 20 in Phoenix won a reprieve from a judge, who ruled that the dog will be neutered and defanged instead of being euthanized . Scarred for life: Kevin Vicente suffered a broken eye socket and jaw in the mauling, and has months, if not years, . of reconstructive surgery ahead of him . The Lexus Project, a New York-based animal rights group and the dog's trustee, has 30 days to find a rehabilitation center or shelter to take Mickey. An animal advocate in court burst into tears when hearing the dog would live. The February 20 attack left toddler Kevin Vicente with a broken eye socket and jaw, and the boy has months, if not years, of reconstructive surgery ahead of him. The question of whether the pit bull should live or die attracted a team of top death penalty lawyers, led to candlelight vigils and riled up thousands of animal lovers on social media who placed blame with the dog's owners and child's baby sitter. Meanwhile, donations and gifts from around the world have flowed in for Kevin since the dog bit the boy in the face. Witnesses testified that little Kevin grabbed Mickey's bone and dropped it when the dog growled. When the toddler made no attempt to flee, the pit bull went on the attack. MyFox Phoenix reported. Floridalma Vicente, the boy's mother, said she is grateful for the outpouring of public support, but can't understand those who came out in support of her son's foul-legged assistant. Public outcry: The Change.org petition to save Mickey has almost 65,000 signatures . 'It disturbed me at first that they placed more value on an animal than on a child, and that made me feel very bad,' Vicente told The Arizona Republic through a Spanish interpreter. 'If they don't care about [Kevin], well, I do.' Neither Vicente nor the man who owned the dog attended the court hearing. Guadalupe Villa, whose boyfriend's mother was looking after Kevin the day of the attack, filed the vicious-dog court petition that started the case, saying Mickey has a history of acting without provocation and killed one of her dogs. Animal advocates struck back, saying both the dog and boy are victims and Kevin's baby sitter was negligent in letting him play near the animal 'unsupervised.' Life sentence: The white-and-brown pit bull will live out his days in an animal shelter without the possibility of ever being put up for adoption . They also argued the owner was fostering aggression by keeping the dog chained up. On Tuesday, Griffin said several people shared some responsibility for the attack. The judge pointed out that there was a 'Beware of Dog' sign on the property's fence but the gate was left open and children were allowed to play near the dog. 'This whole case has been very, very distressing to me,' Griffin said, adding that Kevin will pay the price for the rest of his life. A half dozen animal rights advocates attended the hearing in T-shirts that bore a paw mark and a slogan, 'Save Mickey.' One of them, Veronica Lee, said the hearing showed that the baby sitter wasn't watching closely and that Mickey was kept chained. 'We were not here to put a dog above Kevin,' Lee said. 'We were just here to make sure justice was served.' Nightmare scenario: The dog grabbed Kevin's face and would not let go, causing severe injuries . Eyewitness accounts: People who saw the attack testified that Kevin grabbed a bone from Mickey and then dropped it when the animal growled, but he didn't run, prompting the dog to attack . Luis Acosta, who said he's not related to anyone involved in the case, disagreed with the judge's decision. 'Who is going to see to it five years from now that this dog still hasn't been adopted out?' Acosta said. Those hoping to rescue Mickey took their cause to Facebook, where a 'Save Mickey' page has garnered more than 65,000 likes. On the Facebook page, the pit bull's supporters clarified Tuesday evening that Mickey's fangs will not be pulled out, but rather ground down. The dog's supporters recently used social media to organize a candlelight vigil and even a YouTube video plea. Animal rights activists also took their cause to Change.org, creating a petition to save Mickey from being euthanized that has drawn nearly 65,000 signatures - 10,000 shy of the threshold for the petition to be taken under consideration by the White House. Mickey has been living in a cage at the Maricopa County Animal Control and Care Center.

Updating his Twitter account from the 26th floor of his Midtown apartment, scientist Gurinder Singh 'Mickey' Atwal tweeted that he was unable to escape with his wife and two-year-old son because the stairwells were blanketed with thick smoke. As the fire raged, over 200 firefighters rushed to the 42-storey building at 500 West 43 Street in Manhattan to fight the blaze. Atwal then dramatically revealed that he and his family had sought refuge on their balcony away from the suffocating smoke. Eventually however, firefighters made it to Atwal after battling to reach them and others stranded by the fire which began on the 20th floor and escorted him and his family to safety.

"Support for Ukip is at an all-time high after a week of sleaze in Westminster which saw Maria Miller quit over expenses and MPs accused of sexually assaulting Parliamentary aides . The Conservatives could be pushed into third place at the European elections after the party’s poll ratings plunged in the wake of the Maria Miller expenses scandal. A poll has put the Tories on 23 per cent, behind Labour (31 per cent) and Ukip (28 per cent) just days after the Culture Secretary was forced to resign in an expenses row. The Liberal Democrats were on a dismal 9 per cent, according to analysis of recent polling by Professor Curtice of Strathclyde University. Levels of support for Ukip are now at a record high as they were the only party to gain popularity in a week of sleaze in Westminster, including allegations of sexual assault against young parliamentary aides. In a Comres poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday, Labour remained steady on 35 per cent, opening up a six point lead over the Tories, while the Lib Dems reached an all-time low of just 7 per cent. The survey comes at the end of a bad week for David Cameron, as 62 per cent thought he showed a lack of leadership over his handling of the Maria Miller expenses claims. The Basingstoke MP stepped down from her role as Culture Secretary on Wednesday after being forced to repay £5,800 in mortgage payments and apologise to the House of Commons. Mr Farage's performances in the head-to-head clashes with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg over Britain's future in Europe appear to have paid off, giving him a seven-point bounce in his personal ratings since last month, taking him to 27 per cent. The Deputy Prime Minister is down one point to 12 per cent, while Prime Minister David Cameron has dropped 4 points to 27 per cent and Labour leader Ed Miliband is down 2 points to 20 per cent. Maria Miller is pictured leaving Downing Street this week after leaving her post as Culture Secretary, as 62 per cent of voters say Cameron showed a lack of leadership over the issue . Cameron admitted on Wednesday that he had underestimated the 'raw' public anger that still exists over expenses, and this week has seen a petition launched on change.org demanding that MPs stop policing their own expenses claims. In her petition, first-time voter Uzma Chaudhry says there isn't much 'to vote for' in modern politics, and blames expenses scandals which have 'destroyed young people's faith in politics'. The petition has attracted almost 100,000 signatories and is one of the most popular on the website. Ed Miliband's Labour party now holds a six-point lead over the Tories . How would you vote if there was a general election tomorrow? Lib Dem 7% (-2) Do you have a favourable view of these leaders?

"A Toronto man was bitten on the head by a 400lb black bear - and survived. Joe Azougar, 30, was having breakfast on the porch of his cabin at about 10am on Saturday when a bear suddenly charged at him. 'I could hear this thud, this vibration on the ground. Then there was this bear coming towards me,' Mr Azougar, who had recently moved to the remote cabin from Toronto, said. Joe Azougar gave a thumbs up with girlfriend Brooke Bowerman after surviving a bear attack in Canada . Azougar needed more than 300 stitches to his scalp and shoulder after being attacked. His dog was killed . As the internet entrepreneur ran for cover, his faithful German Shepherd dog ran at the bear. After the bear killed his dog, it charged at the cabin about 10 miles outside of Cochrane, Canada, which Mr Azougar moved about a month ago. 'He started rushing the window, breaking the window and chipping off wood beside the window,' Mr Azougar said. Mr Azougar fled the cabin, but the bear followed. 'He knocked me down and I covered my head. He took my shoulder apart, then he peeled the skin off my head and started biting my skull,' Mr Azougar said. ""I could feel his teeth rubbing against my skull ... I was just screaming. I could feel my flesh being pulled by his teeth,' he told The Sudbury Star. Thankfully, two women driving near his cabin heard Mr Azougar's screams. Relief: Joe Azougar is comforted by his girlfriend Brooke Bowerman as he recovers from the savage attack . They used the car horn to scare the bear away, before driving Mr Azougar to the Lady Minto Hospital in Cochrane. The businessman, who moved to the remote Ontario region to start his own internet company, needed more than 300 stitches and will be kept in hospital for several days. When the women, who have not been identified, first arrived at the cabin they could only see the bear. The woman have not been identified but Mr Azougar is keen to thank them. 'They are my angels. Without them, I wouldn't be alive,' he said. 'If it wasn’t for them, my family would be attending my funeral,' he told CTV News. Mr Azougar is being comforted at the hospital by his girlfriend, Brooke Bowerman,and mother, Itto Bentayed, who drove from Toronto to be at his bedside. Ontario Provincial Police and the Ministry of Natural Resources killed the bear after the attack was reported. In a study of bear attacks between 1900 and 2009 it was found that most happened in Canada. 'From a public safety standpoint, black bears are an unpredictable, wild animal,"" John Kaplanis, of the Northwestern Ontario Sportsmen's Alliance, told The Globe and Mail. Bear aware: Ontario has more than 75,000 black bears like the 400lb one that attacked Mr Azougar . 'They're not the cuddly little teddy bears we see on television.' Ontario has more than 75,000 black bears, but its Ministry of Natural Resources has resisted calls for the spring bear hunting season to be reinstated. Hikers and residents are offered advice on how to be 'bear aware' to prevent attacks and what to do if they come face-to-face with a bear.","Toronto man needs more than 300 stitches after savage attack .

"Facebook is being sued over claims it has been scanning users’ private messages for personal information to sell to advertisers. The social networking site, is accused of monitoring messages and website links sent between users so they can profile what people read online. This in turn allows the website, which has 24million UK members, to charge more for the information. Facebook is accused of monitoring users' private messages to one another to glean personal information that can be sold on to advertising companies . It is thought the information is particularly valuable because people are more likely to reveal their true interests in messages they think are private. The alleged breach of privacy has been exposed by internet experts, who examined whether messages that Facebook insists are private were actually being monitored. The claim relates to messages sent directly to a friend’s inbox, rather than posted on a profile wall, which can be seen publicly. Many people use private messages to send friends links to other websites, such as news articles, shopping sites or sports blogs. Facebook apparently tracked such messages so they could collect data on the interests of people who use the site. Advertising agencies and marketing companies are then allegedly sold this information so they can build up profiles of a person’s interests, and target them accordingly. If the linked webpage contains a ‘like’ button, Facebook will activate this so any company who has been ‘liked’ will see the person is interested in their products. Google, Yahoo! and LinkedIn are among six companies facing accusations of intercepting communications for profit. The allegations have been made in a US lawsuit taken out by Matthew Campbell, from Arkansas, and Michael Hurley, from Oregon. Google and Yahoo (former CEO Terry Semel pictured right) are among six companies facing accusations of intercepting communications for profit . They are seeking compensation of either $100 (£60) for each day the practice has gone on, or $10,000 (£6,000) for each of the US users who have had messages intercepted. They claim Facebook’s breach of privacy violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California privacy and unfair competition laws. While the case only covers users in America, it is believed Facebook members all over the world will have been affected. Swiss information security firm High-Tech Bridge researched their claims by sending links through the private messaging services of 50 social media sites, and experts checked to see which of these were then clicked on by the sites – showing they had been tracked. But computer expert Graham Cluley said: ‘I don’t see anything necessarily wrong in principle with online services automatically scanning messages between individuals, and examining the links that they are sharing. ‘If Facebook’s security team didn’t have such systems in place I would believe them to be disturbingly lax in their duty of care for users.’ A Facebook spokesman added: ‘We believe the allegations are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.’ The site has previously paid $20million (£12million) to members who claimed in 2011 that it had used their data without their consent.","Website accused of monitoring messages to glean advertising preferences .

"A man found critically beaten in a laundromat after at least four minors attacked him with skateboards is now able to speak and says he was trying to break up a fight. Viktor Silcock was found Friday May 10 in a nearby Huntington Beach, California shopping center on the brink of death after a fight that reportedly began over an iPod. Police said Silcock was at the city’s Murdy Park, which includes a skatepark, when his girlfriend tried to stop a group of teenagers from fighting. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brutal: Viktor Silcock was beaten within inches of his life by teenagers wielding skateboards May 10 in Huntington Beach, California . Silcock stepped in and that’s when the teens turned their attention to him. Accounts at that point vary—some witnesses said they saw Silcock attack the skateboarders with a screwdriver and one of the minors told reporters he was stabbed twice during the scuffle—but what happened next is clear. ‘He remembers going to the park,’ Silcock’s mother Anna Belles told KABC. ‘He remembers seeing other kids fighting. And he remembers running.’ Silcock fled and the teenagers reportedly chased him into Surf City Coin Laundry and beat him into unconsciousness with their skateboards. Escalated: Authorities say the fight began when Silcock;'s girlfriend attempted to break up a fight between skateboarding teens in Huntington Beach's Murdy Park . Violent: Silcock then reportedly intervened and was then chased into this laundromat, where he was found brutally beaten . Belles described her son’s condition in a letter sent to reporters Tuesday. ‘Our son suffered a severe brain injury from the savage beating he received,’ Belles wrote. ‘While we concentrate on our son's recovery, we trust that our dedicated Huntington Beach police force will keep up with their investigation and bring the perpetrators of this heinous act to justice.’ Four boys aged 14 to 16, all with previous criminal convictions, were booked at Orange County Juvenile Hall for suspicion of attempted murder. Silcock’s condition has been upgraded . from critical to serious in the days since his attack. He is able to sit . up and speak to his family and Belles said has everyone ‘encouraged.’ Help: Silcock's mother said the park, which saw 5 attacks in 2012, needs to be cleaned up . Family: Seen here are some of Belles' other adopted sons and her wheelchair- bound husband Jordan Silcock. The couple has adopted 59 children over the years . Belles’ optimism should not come as a surprise to anyone in Orange County, where the adoptive mother of 59 disabled children has long been well-known. Viktor was adopted by Belles and her husband Jordan Silcock at age 12. He reportedly grew up with learning disabilities and will likely face surgeries and more adversity as he fights to recover from the attack. ‘I feel really compelled to try to help my city heal from this and, in some way contribute to making the park safer for everybody,’ Belles said. Murdy Park is no stranger to crime and violence. Five incidents of battery were reported in the park in 2012 along with nine incidents of drug possession. Two years prior, in 2010, a man was murdered in the park. Improvement: Silcock remains in the hospital with a hole drilled in his head to relieve swelling, but his condition has moved from critical to serious .","Now Viktor Silcock, 25, is the one fighting, but for his own life, as he remains in the hospital with head trauma so bad doctors had to drill a hole in his skull to ease swelling .

"It became a symbol of brutal German aggression - an unprovoked torpedo attack on a passenger cruise liner during the First World War. The infamous sinking of the Lusitania in 1915, killing more than 1,000 innocent victims, sparked outrage in Britain and America. Public opinion in the States swung against the Kaiser - eventually helping President Woodrow Wilson take the country into the war in 1917. But 70 years after the ship was torpedoed . by a German U-boat eight miles off the coast of Ireland, British Government officials feared the secret of . the tragedy would 'blow up on us' when a group of . divers planned to search the wreck. The sinking of the Lusitania off the coast of Ireland after being torpedoed by a German U-boat proved a major turning point in the war . The unprovoked attack on the Lusitania sparked outrage in Britain, Ireland and America. But the Germans always insisted that the ship was packed with explosives from the States destined for the Western Front . The German high command always maintained the steam liner, traveling between New York and Liverpool, was carrying explosives destined for the Western Front concealed as cheese or casks of beef. But ministers at the time rejected the claim and used the attack to whip up public anger against the Germans. 'Take up the sword of justice – avenge the Lusitania' read one famous poster. The campaign was used effectively in Ireland, where conscription was not compulsory. However, secret government documents released under the 30-year-rule this week reveal that the German claims may have been right all along. After salvage companies applied to raise the 790ft Cunard liner in 1982, the Government fired off warnings about danger to life, according to the National Archives documents. The sinking was a tragedy for more than a 1,000 men, women and children who died - but it was used relentlessly by the British Government to convince Irish and American sceptics to help defeat 'the hun'. Irish men were urged to  'take up the sword of justice - avenge the Lusitania' amid widespread public disgust over the torpedo attack. A series of posters were produced featuring pictures of the dramatic scene. American fury over the attack swung public opinion firmly onto the side of the allies - and against the Germans. This helped President Woodrow Wilson take the US into the war in 1917. Officials feared attempts to survey the wreck would reveal an illegal stash of ammunition - discrediting one of the key reasons why the the Americans were dragged into the war. Files show that the Ministry of Defence even went as far as warning divers that the wreck could contain explosives. Foreign and Commonwealth Office files show that officials feared the controversy would 'literally blow up on us' denting Britain's special relationship with the US. There were also concerns that American survivors and relatives of those who died could sue the Government. In a secret memo, Noel Marshall, from the Foreign Office's North American department, said: 'Successive British governments have always maintained that there was no munitions on board the Lusitania (and that the Germans were therefore in the wrong to claim to the contrary as an excuse for sinking the ship). 'The facts are that there is a large amount of ammunition in the wreck, some of which is highly dangerous.' He added: 'I am left with the uneasy feeling that this subject may yet - literally - blow up on us.' The Lusitania was steaming from New York to Liverpool when she was hit by the German submarine U-20 on May 7, 1915. The . explosives, after being hit by the German torpedo, sparked a larger . blast causing the giant liner -  a sister ship of the Titanic - to sink . in just 18 minutes. The Government has admitted that there were 4,200 'small arms' cartridges and ammunition cases on the ship - and these were declared at the time. But they were not classified as 'ammunition'. Experts claim these could not have been responsible for the second giant explosion which sunk the liner. A senior government lawyer, Jim Coombes, warned there could still be a political scandal if it was found that there had actually been explosives on board. 'It cannot be denied that the sinking of the Lusitania did much to sway American opinion in favour of entering the war,' he wrote. 'If it were now to come to light that there was after all some justification, however slight, for the torpedoing, HMG's relations with America could well suffer.' The UK's relationship with America was crucial in 1982 - at the height of the Cold War. It was also the year in which British troops marched into Port Stanley in the Falklands War. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, pictured here in 1982, were Cold War allies. Britain could not risk damaging the relationship at this time by allowing revelations to emerge that the Lusitania had been piled high with explosives . Destined for Liverpool after setting sail in New York, the Lusitania sank in just 18 minutes eight miles off the coast of Ireland . William Turner, captain of the Lusitania. He survived the attack which killed more than 1,000 civilians . Among those who died in the tragedy included politicians, artists, academics and businessmen, as well as the art collector, Sir Hugh Lane, who is said to have been carrying paintings by Titian, Monet and Rubens in sealed containers. Since 1982, there have been a number of dives and surveys of the wreck, including one in 2012 which found no evidence of any high explosives and concluded the second blast reported by some of the 761 survivors was one of the ships boilers exploding. However the wreck’s owner, Gregg Bemis, an entrepreneur, from New Mexico, who has been trying for 40 years to find out if the ship had a secret military cargo, has asked the Irish Government to sanction further dives to prove his theory. In 1918 a New York judge had ruled that there were 4,200 cases of safety cartridges, 18 fuse cases and 125 shrapnel cases without any powder charge on board the liner when it went down. But he ruled that these did not constitute 'war munitions'. He added that the Lusitania had not been armed or carried any high explosives. The 1915 British inquiry into the sinking of the Lusitania, chaired by Lord Mersey, barely touched on the issue. But when a French survivor, Joseph Marichal, a former army officer, claimed that the ship had sunk so quickly because of a second explosion, his testimony was quickly dismissed. Mr Marichal, who had been in the second-class dining room, said the explosion was 'similar to the rattling of a maxim gun for a short period' and came from underneath the whole floor. But Lord Mersey said: 'I do not believe him. His demeanour was very unsatisfactory. There was no confirmation of his story.'","Cruise liner RMS Lusitania sunk by a German u-boat in May 1915 .

"The murdered bride of Shrien Dewani sent a text message saying her new husband was a flop in bed on their honeymoon, it was claimed today. Mr Dewani, 34, from Bristol, was last . week extradited to South Africa to face trial for the murder of his . wife Anni Dewani, 28, who died when she was   shot in the neck as the . couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town while on their . honeymoon in November 2010. Taxi driver Zola Tongo, who testified that Dewani set up the killing, was jailed along with the two gunmen. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Dewani is pictured with his wife, Anni. South African police say he ordered the killing as he was gay and wanted out of the marriage . Shrien Dewani arrives at the airport in Cape Town after his extradition from Britain last week. He has been sent to a psychiatric hospital until next month after a brief court South African appearance in which he was formally charged with murdering his wife . Mrs Dewani sent the text to her cousin Sneha Hindocha (left) South African authorities believe millionaire Mr   Dewani is secretly gay and wanted to get out of the marriage. The Sun reported Mrs Dewani's uncle Ashok Hindocha claimed she texted cousin Sneha Hindocha saying: 'Finally did it. Not as good as my previous boyfriends.' He rubbished reports that Mrs Dewani said: 'Last night we had it five times'. ' Mrs Dewani's phone was taken by killer Xolile Mngeni during the carjacking, during which Dewani said he was thrown out of the taxi. The   police have only just seen the text after hacking into the Blackberry - a notoriously hard model to crack. Previously, a 40-year-old male prostitute based in Birmingham told police he met Dewani for sex sessions after the relationship with Anni had begun. Shrien Dewani leaves with a police escort from Western Cape High Court in Cape Town . The 34-year-old was brought to Western Cape High Court in Cape Town in a police convoy after he was extradited from Britain last week at the end of a long legal battle . Munich-born Leopold Leisser, known as the 'German Master', told police that Dewani – whom he photographed during one of their meetings – told him that he   was engaged. 'He said that she was a nice, lovely girl, and that he liked her, but that he could not break out of it in any way because he would be disowned by the   family,' he said. But a source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Police have always said the motive for Dewani was he wanted to get out of the marriage without admitting he is gay. 'The fact Anni told her cousin they were having sex regularly severely damages that argument.' Dewani fought a long legal battle against extradition to South Africa to face a conspiracy to murder charge. He lost and now his lawyers, citing his mental health, have appealed to the Supreme Court. Dewani, a care home owner, has always denied ordering the killing of Anni.  He has always denied being gay and says he can prove he was elsewhere on the dates Leisser said they met. Anni's father Vinod Hindocha, 64, and Sneha have previously spoken of their misgivings about the relationship even before the couple had their lavish   £200,000 wedding in a Mumbai hotel. Shrien Dewani's father and other family members arrive at the Western Cape High Court in Cape Town . Anni's father told police that she wanted to end the engagement and walked out on her husband-to-be.  Mr Hindocha said that Anni became convinced that Dewani would change and told her father: 'Papa, he's like a Hitler - but don't worry - I will get   married.' Over a period of four months before the murder, 28-year-old Anni sent a sequence of messages to her cousin Sneha in Britain and they show the young bride   had deep-seated reservations about Dewani. In one despairing message five weeks before the wedding, Anni tells Sneha: 'I don't want to marry him... I'm going to be unhappy for the rest of my   life... one cannot even hug him... we have nothing  in common.' Claims: Prosecutors claim Dewani hired a hitman to kill his wife, which Dewani has consistently denied . CCTV: Footage taken from the couple's honeymoon hotel in South Africa shows the final hours of Anni Dewani who was murdered in 2010 . In another text, Anni wrote: 'Want to cry myself to death.'  Yet another read: 'Crying every day.' A month before the wedding she texted: 'Hate him.' And three days before her death, she messaged Sneha: 'I don't feel happy at all.'  Sneha has told police that Anni called off the engagement and marriage at least three times, only for Shrien to change her mind each time. When the texts are taken alongside statements from other witnesses, the police files depict a marriage that was doomed before it began. Xolile Mngeni, who prosecutors claim was the hitman, was convicted of premeditated murder over the shooting, and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe,   pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year prison sentence.

"Three women who escaped from Warren Jeffs' polygamous sect have revealed what life was like in a world controlled by the convicted pedophile's bizarre rules issued from prison. Twins Heidi and Helen Holm, along with their friend Allie Steed, spent two years living in the claustrophobic world enforced by Warren Jeffs' brother Lyle until they could take no more and fled. Jeffs tightened his regime and expelled many members, including the twins' father, from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Colorado City, Arizona. Scroll down for video . Terrorized: Female members of the FLDS Church. Three young women have spoken out about their time living in convicted pedophile Warren Jeffs polygamous sect .

Allie Holm, now 23, told the Salt Lake Tribune: 'It's like a cloud comes down around you. I couldn’t even breathe.' In June, Warren Jeffs issued a command to his sect - the names of 15 men he has chosen to father all future children of his church. He declared all marriages void until he can return and 'seal' them.

At trial, prosecutors presented DNA . evidence to show he fathered a child with one of those girls, aged 15. He . is serving a life in a Texas prison. Among the men that were banished was the twins' father Lorin Holm. Lyle Jeffs told Mr Holm that in the eyes of God, he was no longer a father and husband to his family and that he had to leave. Mr Holm left his wives and children to set up home in Nevada. Prior to this in 2011, Warren's brother Lyle Jeffs had interviewed each member of . the Church for a 'new United Order' - telling around 1,000 people that . they were not good enough and must leave. The conditions in the FLDS were severe - unmarried . women were not allowed cellphones or jobs where they interacted with . outsiders. Children were forced to give away toys and hair ribbons and clasps were banned.

"A well-known local television news reporter was allegedly punched in the neck by a woman wearing a bed sheet who had allegedly broken into her news van, ate her snacks, and started applying her makeup. Vivian Lee, who works for local New York news station NY1, was reporting on the death of a Brooklyn man who was killed in the recent super storm that passed through the city Thursday night, when a woman came up to her and allegedly punched her in the throat. The reporter, who has been with the station since 2008, said that as a journalist, she’s been put through the ringer, but this inexplicable assault left her trembling. ‘I felt very, very vulnerable,’ she said from a hospital after the attack. Attacked: NY1 news reporter Vivian Lee, right, was allegedly attacked by Theresa Casivant, left, in bed sheet . Odd attire: Casivant was wearing what appeared to be a bed sheet, sweatpants, and green flip flops; Lee added that she smelled of human waste . Veteran reporter: Vivian Lee has been working for NY1 since 2008 . Ms Lee was in Cobble Hill reporting on the death of Richard Schwartz, a 61-year-old state prosecutor who was killed when the storm sent scaffolding careering on top of him. A witness told DNAInfo that they saw a woman, identified later as 24-year-old Theresa Casivant, wearing a white sheet over flip flops and sweat pants enter the NY1 news van around 7am EST on Friday. The witness then said the woman proceeded to use Ms Lee’s makeup and nibble on her food. Ms Lee told the New York Post that she thought Casivant could be mentally ill. ‘I just wanted her out of my truck,’ she explained. When Ms Lee asked Casivant to leave, the 24-year-old Brooklyn resident refused. A NY1 truck operator had to drag her out of the news van.  Still, the woman wouldn’t leave. Ms Lee told the Post: ‘I said, “What is your issue? Are you lost? Are you homeless? Are you sick?”’ and after those comments, Casivant allegedly struck out at her throat. She and the news crew held Casivant until NYPD officers arrived at the scene; Casivant was later charged with assault. Ms Lee said she is used to every kind of . response, saying that she’s been spat at, sworn at, and even sexually . assaulted. But she said that a punch to the neck was a low blow. Food for thought: She allegedly entered a NY1 news van like this one, eating Ms Lee's snacks and putting on her makeup . Mother: Casivant's Twitter profile says she is a mother of two and engaged . Chaotic scene: State prosecutor . Richard Schwartz, 61, was killed by falling scaffolding and debris in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, during last Thursday's storm; Ms Lee was on-scene Friday morning to report . ‘I’m not a print reporter, I need this voice box,’ she told the paper. A spokesperson told DNAInfo that Casivant was taken to Long Island College Hospital for a psych evaluation. According to her Twitter page, she has two young sons, and is engaged. Her last tweet, from August 19, 2011, reads: ‘I couldn’t be any happier with the family that I have! I <3 you ALL!!!’ Ms Lee kept a level head about the alleged attack, telling DNAInfo: ‘It could’ve been worse. This does happen to a lot of media people.’ NY1 is a 24-hour news station operated by Time Warner Cable, and reports on news from around New York's five boroughs.","Woman identified as 24-year-old Theresa Casivant allegedly attacked NY1 reporter Vivian Lee .

"Members of Congress, many of them military veterans who fought in Iraq, pummeled the Obama administration on Thursday for its 2011 troop withdrawal from the Middle Eastern country. They argued that leaving a detachment of U.S. troops there would have prevented the al-Qaeda-related group ISIL, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, from steamrolling a murderous path from Mosul to towns near Baghdad. On Wednesday the group took control of Tikrit, the hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein. ISIL militants have beheaded a crucified Iraqis who stand in the way of their push for a Shariah-compliant state that stretches across sections of Syria and northern Iraq. 'This is a desperate situation. It’s . moving quickly,' Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt said Thursday. He sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'It appears to me that the chickens are coming home to . roost for the president’s policy of not leaving anybody there to be a . stabilizing force.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Clashes between Iraqi security forces and the al-Qaeda-linked Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) near Mosul ended badly for the government as radical Sunni Muslim insurgents seized control of most of Iraq's second largest city . Vietnam War veteran Sen. John McCain blasted Obama, saying he ignored America's national security needs in favor of political advantage when he pulled U.S. troops out of Iraq . House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Mike Rogers, a Republican congressman from Michigan, lashed out at the president for what he said was a lack of respect for blood spilled during nine years of war. 'Given past U.S. sacrifices,' he said, 'it's devastating to see terrorist groups taking over large cities in Iraq and marching to Baghdad – but not surprising.' 'The Obama Administration doesn’t seem much bothered by the chaos,' he said, 'which impacts U.S. national security interests.' 'When ISIS captured Fallujah earlier this year, that should have been a wake-up call.' In January ISIL militants reclaimed Fallujah, a city west of Baghdad on the Euphrates River. U.S. forces captured it in 2004 in the bloodiest battle of the Iraq War. More than 100 American lives were lost. Following a classified intelligence briefing on Thursday, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters that the terrorists overrunning Iraq 'have as part of their agenda to attack out homeland. The next 9/11 is in the making.' The briefing, he said, 'scared the hell out of me. The worst is yet to come.' Some military officials have told The Wall Street Journal that ISIL is . now the single biggest terror threat facing the U.S. 'It makes you want . to kill yourself,' one senior U.S. official said of American intelligence on . the group that he saw during a May meeting . in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Thursday's rhetorical high point, after President Obama assured Americans that he wouldn't 'rule out anything' from his palette of military options, came when Arizona Sen. John McCain took to the Senate floor to blast the president. Just 'because the president of . the United States declares that a conflict is over,' he said, it 'does not mean, in the . eyes of the enemy, that it's over.' 'Could all this have been avoided?' he asked, after reading a three-minute-long description of Iraq's devastation at ISIL's hands. 'The answer is absolutely yes.' 'If I sound angry it's because I am angry.' Obama's pullout, he said, 'was driven by politics and not by our national security interests.' 'I believe that history will judge the president’s . leadership with the scorn and disdain that it deserves,' he concluded,' tossing papers onto a tabletop with disgust. Should they have stayed? U.S. soldiers were in Iraq until December 2011, when President Obama triumphantly withdrew them and declared that the war was over . ISIS Warlord Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seized control of the Iraqi provincial capital of Tikrit just a day after gaining power in the country's second biggest city Mosul . 'I don't rule anything out': President Barack Obama announced Thursday that military options against Iraqi insurgents were on the table, but Republicans won't give him credit for cleaning up his own mess . McCain tied Iraq's return to civil-war footing to Obama's decision to withdraw U.S> troops from Afghanistan by the time he leaves office. 'The Iraq war did not end because the forces against Iraq and within . Iraq were still undefeated,' he boomed. 'The conflict in Afghanistan will not be over . two years from now, in 2017, when the final American is scheduled to . leave Afghanistan.' Ultimately, said McCain, 'it's time the president got a new security team that knows what it is to succeed in conflict.' Senate Armed Services Committee chair Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, insisted that senators 'shouldn’t knee jerk anything.' He blamed Baghdad, not the Obama White House, for the failure to ink a bilateral security agreement that could have kept U.S. troops in Iraq past 2011. 'The Iraqi government – a few years back, when they had a chance to sign an agreement that would keep some of our presence there, refused to do it,' Levin said. 'So we’ve got to be very careful and thoughtful before we do anything.' The proposed 2012-and-beyond agreement was never finalized – partly because Iraq resisted giving American personnel immunity from Iraqi . law, and partly because the Obama administration chose to withdraw . instead of pressing the issue. Georgia Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss, vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, ricocheted an Obama 2012 campaign slogan back in the direction of the Oval Office. 'I hope this is a wakeup call for anyone who thinks al-Qaeda or Islamic extremists are ""on the run"",' he said. ISIL was known as 'Al-Qaeda in Iraq' until early in 2014. Iraqi soldiers have stripped off their uniforms and fled by the thousands as ISIL marches toward Baghdad, leaving entire provinces to the terrorist militants . Three of the 17 members of Congress who fought in Iraq told National Journal on Thursday that the post-withdrawal resurgence of an Al-Qaeda splinter group there cheapened the value of their service. 'Going . out across the desert I remember the feelings that you have, wondering . if you're going to make it out alive, said Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry. 'Right now I wonder what that was all about. What was the point of all of that?' Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia pointed a finger directly at President Obama. 'I think at this point the administration made a choice to cut and run, Collins told National Journal. 'When Fallujah fell again, we knew this foreign policy had consequences.' Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup said maintaining close ties with Iraq, instead of leaving only an embassy contingent there at the end of 2011, would have brought the U.S. 'another ally in the region.' 'I came home from Iraq feeling that we liberated 25 million people,' he said. But now the task falls to Iraqi citizens themselves to hold back ISIL from taking Baghdad, and with it the rest of the country. The Obama administration has sent the Iraqi army everything from rifles to rockets, but much of that materiel is falling into ISIL's hands as soldiers flee battlefields. 'It seems to me that the Iraqis laid down a lot of the arms that we gave to them,' Wenstrup mused. 'So that doesn't seem to be the solution.' Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger told CNN on Thursday that Obama would be responsible for whatever happens in Iraq. 'Let's be clear,' he said. 'The full withdraw in 2011 was a big mistake. We would not be facing this situation.' 'Are airstrikes are going to be the panacea? I don't know, but we're seeing what happens when nothing occurs: You're going to have Baghdad, almost the size of Chicago, in flames.'","Sen.

"She's already the face of Tom Ford, Burberry, Topshop, Mulberry and Chanel but it seems that big brands just can't get enough of Cara Delevingne. The supermodel, actress and singer, who earned £2.4m or £6,500 a day in the past year, has just been unveiled as the face of YSL's Christmas beauty campaign. The 22-year-old, known for her distinctive bushy eyebrows and happy-go-lucky attitude, showcases the French beauty giant's Wildly Gold collection. Another campaign? Cara Delevingne proves she still reigns supreme as the world's most in-demand supermodel as she is unveiled as the face of YSL's Christmas campaign . The range is full of dazzling black, iridescent bronze, shimmery gold and silver shades that Cara showcases to perfection in the new campaign imagery. Cara has been the face of the brand for over a year and worked with best friend and fellow supermodel Jourdan Dunn to promote the Touche Eclat earlier this year. But why do brands still obsess over Cara, who is also building a name for herself as a thespian? And does she still have huge selling power despite spreading herself so thinly in the fashion industry? Rounding the year off nicely! Cara was also unveiled as the face of Topshop's Christmas collection and walked in the SS15 show for Sir Philip Green's brand . Brit babe: The 22-year-old is also the face of Mulberry and recently designed a range of handbags for the luxury British brand . Rakesh Aggarwal, founder of online beauty retailer Escentual.com, said: 'In today's society, celebrity sells - there's no doubt about it. For consumers, purchasing a product endorsed by their favourite star allows them to tap in to the celebrity lifestyle, bridging the gap between themselves and their icons. 'It's only natural that fashion and beauty brands keep returning to Cara Delevingne to front their most crucial campaigns. Whenever Cara lends herself to a product, rest assured it will fly off the shelves. She has a universal appeal - since being labelled the new Kate Moss, she commands media attention and interest like no other public figure. People across the world are fixated on what she is wearing and doing - both on and off the catwalks. Something to smile about: It has been revealed that Cara Delevingne earned £2.4m - or £6,500 a day - in the past year . 'Cara has incredible gravitas in both the high fashion and high street industries - she switches from glamorous gowns and stilettos one day to onesies and trainers the next, pulling off a wealth of different looks with aplomb. She'll be photographed in a T-shirt or beanie hat one night and that product will be completely sold out the next day. 'The biggest reason for Cara's colossal selling power, though, is her quirky character. She is the kind of person girls wish they were friends with - energetic, quirky, vivacious and fun, with a relatable down-to-earth persona. 'Brands are also very aware of Cara's massive social media presence - with 1.94m followers on Twitter and over 8on Instagram, her worldwide influence is ever-growing. She is certainly the fashion and beauty it-girl du jour, and with numerous Hollywood movie appearances now in the pipeline, her massive appeal to companies only looks to increase.' On the runway: Cara boasted £1.1m of cash in the bank and was owed a further £1.3m from modelling deals, reveal figures. Here, she is pictured walking for Topshop, left, and Chanel, right . Power player: The former public school girl, pictured closing the Chanel show with Karl Lagerfeld, boasts nearly 8m followers on Instagram . One thing is for sure: she's cashing in. Cara boasted £1.1m of cash in the bank and was owed a further £1.3m from modelling deals, reveal figures. The debut set of figures are the first-ever marker of the young model’s incredible earning power. The accounts come as the award-winning youngster was also unveiled as the face of Topshop’s Christmas collection. It also follows her latest campaign for iconic British brand Burberry, which saw her feature alongside modelling veteran Kate Moss, 40, who she has been compared to. The accounts, filed at Companies House by her firm Cara & Co, cover the 12 months to the end of January this year. Fun-loving: The model, who is known for her happy demeanor, starred in campaigns and shows for fashion giants Chanel, Victoria's Secret, right, and DKNY . Her work over the period included campaigns and shows for fashion giants Chanel, Victoria's Secret and DKNY. The paperwork shows she had bills of £1.5m, although £326,349 of this was owed to herself as a director. It leaves the fledgling company, set up in January last year, with a total profit of £864,961. The former public school girl boasts nearly 8m followers on Instagram and has also turned her talents to acting and singing. Moschino, Dolce & Gabbana, Stella McCartney, Fendi, H&M and Zara are just some of the other leading companies she has worked for. So powerful is Cara for brand that Celebrity Intelligence, the celebrity monitor, listed her in the top three on its ‘Very Important Endorser’ list for 2014. This list reveals the most in-demand celebrities on both sides of the Atlantic, based on the most searched and viewed this year by 2,500 industry professionals. In Celebrity Intelligence’s 2014 VIE list, UK talent such as Rita Ora, Cara Delevingne, Lily Allen, come out ahead of US favourites Kim Kardashian West, Taylor Swift and Katy Perry. Joseph Morgan, Strategy Director at brand interactions agency Matter of Form, added: 'Cara Delevingne's popularity and subsequent selling power are not just a result of her great social networking skills, modelling career, looks, figure and personality (although this does help). 'They're also a result of her unwavering ability to be herself regardless of audience or channel she's presenting herself in. Whether it is at an event, in the news, through social media or on film, Cara consistently delivers 100 per cent authenticity. 'At a time when many brands are struggling to prove how honest and trustworthy they really are, this is priceless. For brands wanting to position themselves as youthful, credible and straight-talking, Cara is an asset that will only increase in value over time.' Richard Armstrong, CEO & Founder of content marketing agency Kameleon, added: 'Whilst Cara is undoubtedly an icon it would be nice to see brands be more innovative and daring in their approach to using her or other celebrities. We look to these high-end brands to set the precedent in creativity, but if they are all following another where is the differentiation? 'She may be hot property at the moment, but at a time where consumers are bombarded with content, brands need to be brave and stand out from the crowd. These brands are trend-setters; it would be great to see a brand really lead the way by utilising her appeal differently or even building a new icon. 'If used wisely, Cara has the potential to drive significant returns for the brands she works with. If not, brands are at risk of her shelf-life and selling power being limited.'

"Angry villagers yesterday said riots could break out if police do not deal with hundreds of Roma immigrants who they claim have ruined their community. Residents of Hexthorpe, South Yorkshire, said people would take the law into their own hands unless the authorities step in to combat anti-social behaviour. At a public meeting yesterday, emotions ran high as 120 locals confronted police and council officials. Scroll down for video . Trouble brewing: Residents of Hexthorpe, South Yorkshire, said people would take the law into their own hands unless the authorities step in to combat anti-social behaviour they blame on Roma immigrants . Hexthorpe has a population of 3,300 and 500 Roma residents, most of whom are said to have arrived since January when entry rules to the UK were relaxed. Villagers claim Roma groups are fly-tipping and leaving litter in the streets. They say they make so much noise at night that elderly residents have to sleep with ear plugs, while others are scared to go outside. The meeting also heard allegations of assault. Paul Adams, 44, who works in advertising, said: ‘They don’t care about the village or our community. All they are here for is the benefits. ‘They are here to play the system. They are loud, aggressive and intimidating. They gather in groups in the park and on the streets. They’ve attacked people, threatened people. People are intimidated just leaving the house. ‘They throw rubbish everywhere, literally out of their windows into their garden, in the knowledge someone from the council will have to clear it up. It is degrading for the street cleaners to have to be treated that way. What these people need is educating in how to be part of the community.’ He said the problems had hit local house prices too warning: ‘It will come to a point where blood will be spilt if things don’t improve.’ Grandmother Elizabeth Boardman, a widow and former lollipop lady, said she had lived in the village for 30 years and was shocked by the sudden change. She said: ‘Now I wouldn’t walk down the road on my own because there are groups of them everywhere. I’m scared to pass them, they make me feel intimidated and shaken. 'I try to ignore them but you get scared they are going to hit out at you. ‘If they carry on like this people will take the law into their own hands and there will be riots in the streets and I will be blaming the police for not doing anything sooner.’ Her daughter, mother-of-four, Michele . Boardman, 44, who is a full time carer to a disabled son said: ‘A Roma . man threatened to kill my daughters and was holding a knife as they . walked home one night. 'The police haven’t taken statements yet and the incident happened in April. They don’t care. ‘We . just want to be able to provide a happy and safe environment to pass . onto our children and the future generations. The kids can’t understand . why they can’t go and play in the park any more. It’s just not safe for . them. ‘The police need to be . firmer with them and act now or there will be riots here like there . were eight years ago when Iraqi, Kosovans and English clashed. These . people need to learn to respect the area they live in and the people . they are living with.’ One . angry resident told the police officers at the meeting: ‘We feel as . though you are scared of them and it’s to hell with the British. We’ve . lost faith in you. This is our village, it’s time you got off your . backsides and start doing something.’ Another . resident said she had been warned to take down England flags she had . put up outside her house for the World Cup bid, for fear of reprisals . from the Roma community. Roma in the Page Hall area of Sheffield: A package of measures has been introduced in a bid to calm tension and the police team is being taught their language to engage with the migrants directly . ■  Police are learning to speak the Roma language as part of an effort to tackle community unrest in an inner city suburb. A specialist community police team has been drafted in to prevent clashes between hundreds of Roma Slovak migrants and local residents upset at their ‘anti-social behaviour’ in the Page Hall area of Sheffield. A package of measures has been introduced in a bid to calm tension and the police team is being taught their language to engage with the migrants directly rather than work through interpreters. They are patrolling the streets seven days a week and have a permanent base in the area. The South Yorkshire Police team has been tasked with helping agencies resolve issues and problems. Inspector Chris Lewis, who is in charge of the team, said: ‘Everything is about raising standards - improving housing, cleaning up the streets, creating more open space, providing more recreational opportunities - helping people to take pride in the area.’ Last year local Labour MP David Blunkett warned that tensions between residents and Roma migrants could escalate into violence if the problem wasn’t tackled effectively.","Residents of Hexthorpe accuse new arrivals of fly-tipping and littering .

"The former prime minister said it Ed Miliband must not win any votes by taking a tougher line on immigration and Europe. He said changing course now would only 'confuse' voters . Tony Blair this morning launched a furious assault on Ukip in the wake of the party's European election triumph - describing it as 'nasty and unpleasant'. The former Prime Minister urged the Labour leader Ed Miliband to 'stand up' and take on Nigel Farage. He said Mr Miliband had to 'stand firm' in the face of growing demands to promise an in-out referendum on Europe and ignore pleas from within his party to take a tougher stance on immigration. It came after Labour MP Simon Danczuk broke ranks to demand stricter curbs on who can come to work in Britain. But Mr Blair said swinging to the right on Europe and immigration would only 'confuse' Labour voters. The former PM's intervention this morning risks deepening the growing division within the party over how to respond to Ukip's rise, amid growing fears that it will eat into traditional Labour heartlands at next year's election. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw ‏said Mr Blair's interview was 'great'. He added, in a thinly-veiled attack on Mr Miliband, that it was 'what many of us have been wanting & waiting to hear'. Speaking on Radio 4, Mr Blair said: 'The way to deal with Ukip is to stand up and take them on, because what they're putting before people is a set of solutions that anybody who analyses where a country like Britain has to be in the 21st century, knows they are solutions that are regressive, reactionary and would make all the problems of the country worse, not better.' Mr Blair added that Mr Miliband had to be 'prepared to stand up, to lead, to take them on' and 'confront and expose reactionary forces'. When asked about the growing pressure to offer voters an in-out referendum, Mr Blair added: 'I’d advise him to stay firm.' He said: 'It’s not as if yielding to that pressure from Ukip has actually done the Conservatives any good at the present time. 'For the Labour Party if it tries to follow either Ukip on its anti-European platform or, even worse frankly, on its anti-immigrant platform, all that will happen is it will confuse its own supporters and it won't actually draw any greater support.' He said to allow a trend of 'anti-immigrant feeling' would be a 'huge mistake for the country'. Mr Blair added: 'People in Ukip always say that the other politicians don't get it. I mean, I do get it and I get them. You look a little bit beneath that Ukip facade and you see something in my view pretty nasty and unpleasant.' Veteran Cabinet minister Ken Clarke said Ukip voters were 'blaming foreigners' for the country's problems and urged David Cameron to push ahead with his plan to reform the EU . Mr Blair's warning was echoed by the veteran Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke - who also lashed out at Ukip for pandering anti-immigration voters. Speaking before Mr Blair on the Today programme this morning, the Europhile former Tory Chancellor claimed Mr Farage was out of touch with ordinary Brits who did not care that the UK attracted a lot of foreigners. In a dig at the Ukip leader's comments that he felt uncomfortable listening to foreign languages on the train, Mr Clarke said: 'Every western country is multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and everybody gets used to listening to foreign languages on the bus. Young people aren't bothered by that.' Mr Clarke accepted immigration needed to be 'controlled' but added that Britain needed foreigners to help the economy. He added: 'We need some people to do jobs that British people somehow can't be persuaded to do.' Ukip's rise was 'symbolic of the disillusion' voters felt with politics, Mr Clarke said. He added: 'People are blaming foreigners and blaming Brussels.' But he said: 'Only one in 10 of the electorate voted for UKIP... the important thing is, really, two-thirds of the electorate couldn't be bothered to vote at all. 'I think what we have to do is firstly persuade those people - particularly younger people - actually to vote when they say they're not interested or all the politicians are the same and all the rest of it. 'We have to make the case, the intelligent case, why it's in Britain's national interest to stay in the European Union, and what sensible reforms we can actually make of the European Union that mainstream politicians across the rest of Europe are likely to agree to, because they face the same problem that we do. 'I think, actually, we need to articulate the case, as to why it's in the national interest - particularly younger people whose future it is - that our prosperity, our political security, our role in the world actually depend on our being a leading member of the European Union.' The Cabinet minister dismissed suggestions his colleague Theresa May was being soft on immigration but agrees it is good for the country. 'We're in the 21st century, it's no good blaming foreigners, blaming England, telling our damn politicians 'you need to look at our role in the EU in terms of the malaise of the population in their prosperity and the sense of security. 'The first thing to point out is that immigration is a feature of the 21st century in every prosperous western democracy.' Mr Blair's remarks this morning came after he was criticised  for complaining about voters who elected Ukip MEPs opposed to rampant immigration – despite  running an ‘open door’ policy on migrants while in office. The former prime minister said it was wrong that the debate on the EU was dominated by ‘anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get Britain out of Europe’. These, he added, were ‘not answers to what is happening in the world’. But critics pointed out that it was Mr Blair’s policies which caused the problems in the first place by allowing immigration to run rife over the last decade, creating the largest population explosion since Saxon times. In his comments, made to a Swedish television station, Mr Blair said: ‘Of course we should be worried when a party like Ukip comes first in the European election, it would be foolish not to be. ‘But on the other hand we also have to stand for what is correct and right for the future of Britain in the 21st century. ‘When the world is changing so fast, to end up having the debate dominated by anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get Britain out of Europe, these are not solutions for the 21st century.’ But Douglas Carswell, the Tory MP for Clacton, said Mr Blair was a member of a ‘supranational, smug, anti-democratic elite’. He added: ‘Tony Blair was in charge of this country when the floodgates were opened. Labour’s open-door migration policy led to the largest population explosion in Britain in more than a thousand years. Between 1997 and 2010, the foreign-born population of the UK increased by three million, while nearly a million British citizens left. In that period, the size of the foreign-born workforce nearly doubled. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage poses for photographers at a pub ahead of a press conference in central London yesterday . In 1997, people born outside the UK held two million jobs – making up around 7.5 per cent of the total workforce. By 2009, that had swelled to 3.8million jobs, or 13 per cent of the total. Labour ministers predicted in 2004 that opening Britain’s labour market to millions of workers from former Eastern Bloc countries would result in only 13,000 new arrivals. By the end of 2009, more than a million workers had signed up to a Home Office registration scheme. In 2009 former Blairite aide Andrew Neather revealed that the increase in immigration under Labour was a deliberate policy designed to change Britain. He said the influx of foreign nationals was intended to socially engineer a ‘truly multicultural’ country. It was also a politically motivated attempt to ‘rub the Right’s nose in diversity’, he said.

"Beau Biden has defended the judge who decided to let an heir to the du Pont family agree to a plea deal after being charged with sexually abusing his young daughter. Biden, the Vice President's son who is in his second term as Delaware Attorney General, wrote a letter supporting Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden and her decision to allow Robert H. Richards IV to admit to fourth degree rape and register as a sex offender but not serve any time. Her decision prompted outrage after she supported the move by writing that the heir, who just turned 48 yesterday, 'would not fare well' in prison. Wading in controversy: Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden (pictured here in February 2013) has written a letter defending the plea deal offered to a wealthy heir who sexually assaulted his young daughter . 'This was not a strong case, and a loss at trial was a distinct possibility,' Biden wrote in his letter to The News Journal. 'In recognition of the weakness of the . case, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea and sentence recommendation . that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex . offender, participate in court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation . therapy and to have no contact with the victim and any other child under . the age of 16. Support: Biden wrote a letter defending the decision handed down by Judge Jan Jurden (pictured) 'A loss at trial would have rendered any of these restrictions impossible.' The ruling was made in 2009 but the case came back to the forefront when Richards' ex-wife Tracy filed a lawsuit to seek damages. In the suit, she detailed the how Richards allegedly sexually assaulted their daughter four times over the course of nearly two years from the time the girl was 3-years-old. In her lawsuit, Tracy charges that he . penetrated his daughter with his fingers while masturbating, and . subsequently also assaulted his toddler son as well. It . has not been revealed how much compensation Tracy Richards is seeking . from her ex, who is unemployed and living off his trust fund. He is the great-grandson of Irenee du Pont, the patriarch in the family of chemical barons. On Sunday, it was revealed that Judge . Jurden originally sentenced Richards to spend eight years behind bars . but then substituted the hard time for probation and the other . stipulations. Judge Jurden was issued a security detail when activists started threatening her over the case. Biden argued that in spite of her . controversial ruling, the judge 'exercised sound discretion based solely . on the merits of the case before her.' Horrific: Robert Richards IV (left) accepted a plea deal over sexually abusing his daughter when she was 3-years-old, but his ex wife Tracy (right) has now accused him of also sexually assaulting their son . 'The defendant did not make a statement to police, although he made an ambiguous apology to the victim's mother. A conviction would have required 12 jurors to find unanimously, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime had occurred,' Biden wrote. Richards has never faced any charges relating to the alleged abuse of his son, but is currently on probation for the abuse against his daughter, who is now 11. The lawsuit claims that he entered her bedroom at night while she slept and penetrated her with his fingers while masturbating, said the lawsuit, which includes documents from the criminal case. Abuse of the children occurred at both of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville, Delaware mansion that he paid $1.8million for.

Family name: Robert Richards IV (right) is the unemployed great-grandson of Irenee du Pont (left), the patriarch in the family of chemical barons . Richards, who is 6'4 and about 250 . pounds, told the girl 'to keep what he had done to her a secret,' but in . October 2007 she told her grandmother, who informed Tracy Richards, the . lawsuit said. The girl was taken to her pediatrician, whom she told about the abuse, and New Castle County police arrested him that December. The proven abuse of his daughter and alleged assault of his son has caused his children 'long-term injuries,' the lawsuit filed Tuesday said, perhaps including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction and shame. His daughter also has 'repressed memories of some instances of the abuse she suffered,' and if the son was abused, the same is true with him, the suit said. With medical treatment, the lawsuit said, those memories will likely 'begin to surface.' 'Making matters worse this self-admitted rapist and child abuser has not paid a single penny to these children for his crimes. There is no provision whatsoever for them for their future after they turn 18,' said Attorney Thomas Crumplar, who is representing Tracy Richards.","Delaware Attorney General Biden has written a letter supporting the judge who made a controversial call .

"Four in 10 voters think Nigel Farage poses a ’danger to Britain’ after he heaped praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, an exclusive poll for MailOnline reveals today. The survey reveals the UKIP leader is also seen as ’a bit sleazy’ while his Lib Dem rival Nick Clegg is out of his depth and less likely to tell the truth. The ComRes poll comes as the two men prepare to go head-to-head tomorrow night in the second live TV debate on Britain’s membership of the European Union. Scroll down for video . UKIP has been outpolling the Lib Dems for months, buoyed by support switching from the Tories and disaffected voters being won over by Mr Farage’s populist charm. After the two men clashed in the first debate last week, a snap poll suggested Mr Farage won by a margin of 2-1. Ahead of the BBC debate tomorrow night, pollsters ComRes asked voters to consider several statements and say whether they applied more to Mr Farage or Mr Clegg. The results reveal weaknesses in both camps. In the poll, 38 per cent of people . said Mr Farage ’is a danger to Britain’, compared to just 23 per cent . who said the same of Mr Clegg. Despite . UKIP drawing much of its support from older voters, 44 per cent of . people aged 55-64 said Mr Farage posed a threat to the UK. Half . of people working in the public sector, and 44 per cent of people in . Scotland and the South West also agreed Mr Farage was a danger to the . country. Ukip leader Nigel Farage came out top in a snap poll after his first TV debate on the EU with Lib Dem Nick Clegg last week . Mr Farage has faced criticism for his . recent claims that he ’admires’ Russian President Vladmir Putin, and . said claiming the European Union was to blame for deaths on the streets . of Kiev. Defending the . comments yesterday, Mr Farage insisted: ’I said I don't like him, I . wouldn't trust him, wouldn't want to live in his country. ’But compared with the kids who run foreign policy in this country I have got more respect for him than our lot.’ Asked in the GQ interview which current world leader he admired most, Mr Farage replied: ’As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say Putin. The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant.’ He was also accused of being 'extreme' by Mr Clegg after claiming the European Union has 'blood on its hands' over the conflict in Ukraine. Both leaders had hoped that their appearance in the TV debates would make them appear more statesmanlike. But after their first encounter on Sky News and LBC, only 18 per cent of voters thought either of them would make a good Prime Minister. It is particularly galling for Mr Clegg who has spent four years at the heart of the coalition government. Last week’s debate was dominated by . rows over the use of statistics, with Mr Farage claiming 75 per cent of . Britain’s laws come from Brussels and Mr Clegg insisting the figure was . more like 7 per cent. However, just 18 per cent of people said Mr Clegg 'tells the truth’ while 25 per cent said the same of Mr Farage. Damningly, just 8 per cent of voters in Wales think Mr Clegg tells the truth. The Deputy Prime Minister recorded the same low figure (8 per cent) among . retired people living on a state pension, where 38 per cent said Mr . Farage told the truth. A quarter of all those surveyed also said Mr . Farage 'knows what he is talking about’, although this was split between . 32 per cent of men and only 19 per cent of women. Just 23 per cent of people said Mr Clegg knew what he is talking about. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: 'While there is little good news for either leader here, Nick Clegg should be the more worried. 'After nearly four years as Deputy Prime Minister he has failed to convince the British public he is more Prime Ministerial than a leader of a Party with no MPs. However there is also a warning for Nigel Farage that many see him as a danger to Britain.' One of the most striking difference . came when voters were asked which of the two leaders they most . considered to be ’a bit sleazy’. Overall, 40 per cent named Mr Farage, double the 21 per cent who named Mr Clegg. Half of people in the public sector and the better off (AB social grade) said Mr Farage was sleazy. However Mr Farage’s fortunes were reversed when the survey asked which of the two leaders is ’out of his depth’. Some 42 per cent named Mr Clegg, to just 26 per cent who lambasted Mr Farage. Much of Mr Farage’s appeal has been based on his apparently insatiable appetite for a drink in a pub. As he left last week’s debate he was asked if he was going to the pub, and he replied: ’Well I’m not going to church.’ Complaining about the three-day window . before postal votes were sent out in a by-election campaign last month, . he said: ’I have been in benders for longer than the opening of the . nominations and the start of postal ballots.’ Overall, a third (33 per cent) of people said they thought Mr Farage would be good to have a pint with. Among men the figure rose to 44 per cent, falling to just 22 per cent among women. Mr Clegg was marginally more of a hit . with the ladies - 14 per cent of female voters wanted a pint with him, . over 13 per cent of men. However, fewer than one in 10 housewives and househusband would venture out for a pint with Mr Clegg. Similarly 13 per cent of women thought Mr Clegg would 'make a good date', compared to just 8 per cent for Mr Farage. However, Mr Farage was a more popular choice for a date among men - 12 per cent to Mr Clegg’s 10. On several measures there was little to divide the two men. Just over a third said both men were 'annoying' - 35 per cent for Mr Clegg and 34 per cent for Mr Farage. Older people and people in the North . East were more likely to find Mr Clegg annoying, while Mr Farage . irritated the better-off, people with a private pension and Scots.","MailOnline/ComRes survey reveals what voters think of the two leaders .

"A drug has been shown to be highly effective in reducing symptoms of depression without having a negative effect on libido, according to research. Agomelatine acts on the hormone melatonin, which is thought to play a part in mood disorders. It has also been found to cause fewer of the other side effects associated with many conventional drugs, including weight gain. No effects: The new drug Agomelatine does not affect the patient's libido . Its therapeutic effects can kick in earlier too – within the first week in some cases – compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which can take weeks to work. Depression affects about one in ten adults at some point, and many sufferers are prescribed antidepressants. The drugs change the levels of a group of brain chemicals, including serotonin and norepinephrine. Making more of these chemicals available can improve mood and emotion, although how and why is not fully understood. Common illness: Depression affects one in ten adults at some point in their lives . However, common side effects of SSRIs include low sex drive or erectile dysfunction. There is increasing evidence that the body’s circadian rhythm system, which governs the release of hormones, is also heavily involved in depression. This led to the development of agomelatine. It mimics the activity of melatonin, helping to regulate the circadian rhythm. Melatonin is produced at night and is involved in the sleep-wake cycle. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Ken Checinski says: ‘This is an important addition to the range of drug treatments for depressive disorder and should be considered where side effects with SSRIs have been a problem for the patient.’","Agomelatine has been found to cause fewer side effects than normal drugs .

"The Rockefeller family are one of America's best known dynasties but among the tales of business acumen and astounding wealth are stories of tragedy. From mistresses and depression, to cannibalism and even an imposter who hid behind the famed name before being charged with murder, the family has endured a tragic side. The most recent heartbreak for the family came on Friday, when Richard Rockefeller, the great grandson of oil baron John D. Rockefeller, died when his light aircraft crashed outside New York City. Scroll down for video . Founding father: Oil baron John D Rockefeller, pictured with his family in 1916, set the family on a path to great wealth . American great: John D. Rockefeller made his money by bringing indoor lighting to the masses . The 65-year-old doctor had, like many of his relatives, enjoyed a successful career. He had been returning to his Maine home after celebrating his father's 99th birthday. Loss: Dr Richard Rockefeller, 65, died when his plane crashed on Friday . Family spokesman Fraser Seitel told the Portland Press Herald: 'The . family is in shock. This was a terrible tragedy. Richard was a . wonderful cherished son and brother, father, husband and grandfather. 'He . was an experienced pilot and a respected medical doctor, who most . recently was working on treating PTSD in veterans. And it’s just . horribly sad.' Dr Rockefeller's family first made their fortune when John D. Rockefeller co-founded Standard Oil in 1870, bringing affordable indoor lighting to American homes. While he lived to the grand age of 97, several of his descendants had their lives cut short in tragic circumstances. One of the first tragedies to befall the family came in 1951, when Rockefeller's great-niece Winifred, killed herself and two of her children at their Greenwich home, LoHud reported. Just ten years later, in 1961, Michael Rockefeller died in mysterious circumstances while gathering indigenous art in New Guinea. MIchael, whose father Nelson was Governor of New York, had been canoeing down a river when his boat capsized. No body was ever found, but it was widely believed that he made it to shore, only to be eaten by cannibals. Richard Rockefeller poses next to a vehicle while working with Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Peru during the 1990s in this image provided by MSF . The wreckage of Richard Rockefeller's small plane lies in the yard of a Purchase, New York home after crashing shortly after take-off on Friday . His twin sister, Mary Rockefeller . Morgan, dismissed the rumors that he was eaten, but said it took years . for her to get over the devastation of losing her 23-year-old brother. 'Nobody . knows what happened to Michael, and that leaves our family in a . terrible place of not knowing,' she told People magazine. I wanted him . to be alive so much that sometimes I thought I saw him in a crowd.' The death of the twins' father was also shrouded in mystery after Nelson Rockefeller, who served four terms as New York Governor, died at home with his 25-year-old assistant in 1979. It was alleged that the assistant Megan Marshack was having an affair with Nelson - a former Vice President - and that she waited an hour before calling for help when he died, according to the New York Post. Family tree: John D. Rockefeller, right, is pictured with John Jr and Nelson Rockefeller in 1932 . Mystery: Michael Rockefeller, 23, disappeared during an expedition to New Guinea in 1961 . Devastated: Michael's twin sister Mary said it took years for her to get over the sudden loss of her brother, who was 23 when he disappeared . A year before his own death, Nelson's brother John Rockefeller III was killed when his car was involved in a deadly head-on crash near the family's Pocantico Hills estate. The weight of the family's reputation and success has also played heavily on descendants of the oil baron and founding father. Eileen Rockefeller, a great-granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller, revealed last year that her mother battled with depression and her father was consumed with boardroom meetings during her childhood. She told CBS: 'There is no question that the privileges have way outweighed the responsibilities, the difficulties. But where I think I feel common ground with everybody watching is that we all suffer from something growing up. Success: Nelson Rockefeller, seated, served as New York Governor four times. He is pictured with his wife and children, including twins Mary and Michael . Ambitious: As well as being governor, Nelson served as Vice President under Ford . 'It doesn't matter if we have money or don't have money; we suffer in our own ways. And the net worth of our bank account is not nearly so important, ultimately, as the self-worth.' Imposter: Convicted murderer Christian Gerhartsreiter passed himself off as Clark Rockerfeller . She added that the accomplishments of the family made her own successes feel overshadowed. 'Every time in any high school paper, college paper, where I had attempted to write anything about my family I would just feel overwhelmed by how much had been accomplished and no matter what I did I would feel so small,' Ms Rockefeller said. Perhaps the most high-profile scandal involving the Rockefeller name didn't actually involve an actual member of the family. A con artist and convicted murderer Christian Gerhartsreiter managed to wile his way into the heart of the art world and establishment by posing as Clark Rockefeller. His . tangled web of lies fell apart when he kidnapped his daughter during a . custody battle, and was finally sentenced to prison for the murder of . John Sohus, the son of his former landlady. The fake Rockefeller is currently serving a 27-year prison sentence. The oldest living family member in the dynasty is David Rockefeller who, at 99 years old, is ranked by Forbes as the 49th-richest person in the . world, worth an estimated $2.7 billion.

"The world's first test-tube baby paid tribute to her parents' bravery today - saying they stepped into the unknown by having her. Louise Brown, 35, was born at Oldham General Hospital on July 25 1978 after her parents Lesley and John became the first people to successfully undergo in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Her birth attracted controversy, with religious leaders expressing concern about the use of artificial intervention and some raising fears that science was creating 'Frankenbabies'. Tribute: The world's first test-tube baby Louise Brown, left, and her sister Natalie with their sons Aiden and Aeron both 15 weeks. They planted a tree in memory of their parents John and Lesley at Bourn Hall, Cambridgeshire, today . Family affair: The sisters have now had families of their own including Aeron Derrick  (top left) and Aiden Brown (right) both 15 weeks, then (left to right) Christopher Derrick, 12, Daniel Derrick, 8, Casey Derrick 14, and Cameron Brown, 6 . However, it also paved the way for five million further IVF births. Lesley died last year aged 64, following the death of her husband several years earlier. Mrs Brown lives in Bristol with her husband, Wesley Mullinder, and in August the couple celebrated the birth of their second son Aiden. Her sister Natalie, who was the first IVF baby to have a child, gave birth to her fourth child, Aeron, in August. There are now six grandchildren in the family. Today the sisters planted a tree in memory of their parents at Bourn Hall - the Cambridgeshire clinic where the techniques and drugs were first developed. Pioneers: While planting a tree at the clinic in memory of her late father and mother, Mrs Brown said her parents had 'paved the way' for 5million IVF births . Memory: The tree and this plaque were installed at the Bourne Hall Clinic in Cambridgeshire today - where IVF techniques were developed . Mrs Brown described how the breakthrough not only gave life to herself and her sister, but also to their own children. She said: 'I don't know what would have happened to mum and dad if it hadn't work - it was what made them.' 'It's a shame she didn't meet Aeron and Aiden but being able to look after her grandchildren meant a lot to her. Having grandchildren and a wider family was part of her original dream.' Her parents' pioneering role was only a by-product of their desire for a family, she said. World first: Parents John and Lesley . Brown celebrate the birth of Louise shortly after she was born in 1978 . Controversy: The birth of Louise pictured with her father John, sister Natalie and mother Lesley when she was a teenager, sparked controversy - with some slamming the process for creating 'Frankenbabies' 'After nine years of trying I think mum just heard the words ""you might be able to have a baby"" and they were that desperate they would have done anything. 'I don't really think they knew it hadn't happened before and, in a way, that was good because it meant they believed it would work. They didn't really talk about the controversy. They wanted children and that was that. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a process where an egg is fertilised by sperm outside the body. The technique involves monitoring and stimulating a woman's ovulatory process, removing eggs from the ovaries and letting sperm fertilise them in a laboratory. The fertilised egg is then cultured for two to six days before being transferred to the patient's uterus. Robert G. Edwards, the physiologist who developed the treatment, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010.The term test tube babies is used colloquially to refer to IVF children. It refers to the tube-shaped containers commonly used in chemistry labs and biology labs. IVF is usually performed in shallower containers called Petri dishes, however. 'With all the media attention, she would sometimes say it was as though I wasn't her baby. But she was brilliant, she did everything a mother could do and I try to follow her example. 'She was always there, a good listener. She was quite strict as well and kept us on the right path. She just did her best.' Both sisters conceived naturally, but she said she would have considered IVF had she not been able to. 'Although it doesn't work for everybody, you just do what you have to do,' she said. The sisters planted the tree at the clinic in recognition of the role it played in making medical history and making two generations of their family possible. The clinic's founders, Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards, are seen as the pioneers of IVF. Current medical director Dr Thomas Mathews said John and Lesley Brown were also pioneers. 'Lesley was one of the sweetest and most cheerful women I have ever met at Bourn Hall. She always had a smile on her face, and was a source of great inspiration to others. She and John were more than willing to share their previous experiences with others around them,' Dr Matthews said. Bourn Hall continues to collaborate with the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Centre to develop the science behind IVF.","Lesley and John Brown were the first people to successfully undergo IVF .

"This collection of rare color photos of Berlin in 1937, taken by Thomas Neumann and uncovered from Norwegian archives, show life in the German capital during a tumultuous decade. They capture scenes in the vibrant city, which was under the iron grip of Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich at the very height of his power. Yet just eight years later the city was in ruins as Russians and Allies occupied it in victory. But at the time these images were taken, Hitler's Berlin was vibrant. Hitler had taken power after the collapse of the democratic Weimar Republic in 1933 as severe economic problems caused by the Great Depression drove ordinary Germans into the far-right party's arms. As well as chilling pictures of . buildings emblazoned with swastikas, there are scenes of ordinary life . as Germans go about their business. They show a child in a sun-drenched square, smiling friends at a train . station, a cart selling bananas and a food vendor in a sunny park.

In 2007 his photo gallery given to the National Archives of Norway by his daughter. Thomas Neumann trained as an electrical engineer in Dresden. After graduating in 1928 he worked in Berlin until 1933. Neumann was a member of the National Unity party, a fascist organisation and was appointed its propaganda leader in Oslo and Akershus. He left the party in 1937 and in October 1944 he was arrested for illegal activities and sent to the notorious Grini concentration camp.

"'Smart drugs' are taken to boost a student's exam results, but they could be having the opposite effect,  warns new research. A study found some healthy students who took a well-known 'smart drug' noticed their performance impaired by the drug. Students taking  Modafinil had slower reaction times and were less able to think creatively, scientists discovered. However, for students lacking a creative spark in the first place, overall performance was found to improve. Healthy students who took a well-known 'smart drugs' had slower reaction times and were less able to think creatively, a study found . Figures suggest one in five students have taken the so-called 'smart' drug Modafinil to boost their ability to study and improve their chances of exam success. Modafinil pills keep users alert and awake, increasing their ability to concentrate and process information . They have been proven to improve memory by 10 per cent. However, they can have worrying side-effects — including headaches, irritableness, vomiting, irrational behaviour, tremors, palpitations and broken sleeping patterns. The study showed it had negative effects in healthy people. Doctor Ahmed Dahir Mohamed, of The University of Nottingham, Malaysia Campus, said he didn't expect students taking Modafinil to show slower reaction times. He said: 'We looked at how the drug acted when you are required to respond accurately and in a timely manner. Our findings were completely opposite to the results we expected.' The study involved 32 healthy participants taking the drug who were compared to 32 given a placebo. Modafinil is a prescription-only stimulant used by doctors to treat patients suffering from the sleeping disorder narcolepsy. Modafinil pills are being sold for as little as 50p each and have been proven to improve memory by 10 per cent. They keep users alert and awake, increasing their ability to concentrate and process information. However, they can have worrying side-effects — including headaches, irritableness, vomiting, irrational behaviour, tremors, palpitations and broken sleeping patterns. All took a neuropsychological task known as the Hayling Sentence Completion Test in which they were asked to respond quickly and accurately to tasks. Dr Mohamed said: 'It has been argued that Modafinil might improve your performance by delaying your ability to respond. 'It has been suggested this 'delay dependent improvement' might improve cognitive performance by making people less impulsive. 'We found no evidence to support those claims. 'Our research showed that when a task required instant reactions the drug just increased reaction times with no improvement to cognitive performance.' The findings back up his previous research that showed so called 'smart' drug impaired the participant's ability to respond in a creative way, particularly when they were asked to respond laterally - thinking outside the box. However, the study did find those who weren't particularly creative to start with, saw their performance increase in problem solving tasks requiring creativity. The study backs up previous research that suggests the drugs improve people at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of memory, learning, reasoning and problem solving, but impair healthy people who are performing at their optimum level of intelligence. Researchers concluded that Modafinil improves the performance of less capable students, but impairs the performance of those who are already performing well academically . He said: 'It looks like Modafinil is not helpful for healthy individuals and it might even impair their ability to respond and might stifle their lateral thinking, while people who have some sort of deficiency in creativity are helped by the drug. 'What I have found in my doctoral studies is that if you are already a healthy person and functioning at an optimum level, it is really difficult to improve your cognition. 'As teenagers' brains are still developing it might be possible to improve their learning through positive interaction with others, healthy diet or mindfulness meditation,' he added. The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.","A fifth of students have taken the so-called 'smart' drug Modafinil .

"A year after a controversial . biography of Mahatma Gandhi claimed he was bisexual and left his wife to . live with a German-Jewish bodybuilder, the Indian government has bought a collection of letters between the two men days before they were to be auctioned. India paid around £700,000 (60million rupees) for the papers, which cover Gandhi's time in South Africa, his return to India and his contentious relationship with his family. The auction was to be held at Sotheby's in London on Tuesday but was called off at the last minute. Lovers? Mahatma Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach sit either side of a female companion. The Indian government has bought a collection of letters between the two men days before they were to be auctioned . The documents will now be placed with the National Archives of India in New Delhi. They previously belonged to relatives . of Hermann Kallenbach, a German-born Jewish architect who met Gandhi in . South Africa in 1904 and was impressed by his ideas. Last year, a Gandhi biography by author Joseph Lelyveld called Great Soul: Mahatma . Gandhi And His Struggle With India detailed the extent of his . relationship with Kallenbach. It claimed that the leader of the Indian independence movement was deeply in love with Kallenbach. Mr Lelyveld denied that his . book said Gandhi was bisexual. But Gandhi's home state of Gujarat banned . it as an 'insult' to the father of the nation. Most of the correspondence, which . spans five decades from 1905 to 1945, is from family, friends and . followers of Gandhi, but there are also 13 letters written by him to . Kallenbach. They reference Gandhi's early political campaigns and the illness of his wife Kasturba. He wrote in one letter: 'I no longer . want to be angry with her so she is sweet... She had a few grapes today . but she is suffering again. It seems to be me she is gradually sinking.' In another, written before his return . to India from South Africa, Gandhi wrote: 'I do all my writing . squatting on the ground and eat invariably with my fingers. I don't want . to look awkward in India.' Indian historian Ramchandra Guha discovered the letters at the home of Kallenbach's grand-niece, Isa Sarid. Almost auctioned: The documents previously belonged to relatives of Kallenbach, a German-born Jewish architect who met Gandhi in South Africa in 1904 and was impressed by his ideas . Gandhi and Kallenbach became constant companions after they met in Johannesburg in 1904. Among the most illuminating of the . documents are dozens of letters written by Gandhi's sons which provide . details of his life in India, particularly in the period immediately . after his return, when he lived in relative obscurity. 'Father is becoming more and more awful,' read one incomplete letter probably written by Harilal, his eldest son. 'It would not be strange if a time . may come one of these days when either those who are living with Father . might have to go or he might leave us all not being able to stand our . life.' India has in the past complained . bitterly about private auctions of Gandhi's belongings, saying they . insulted the memory of a man who rejected material wealth. A senior official at the ministry of . culture in New Delhi said: 'These papers are of huge importance to India . to carry out research on the Gandhian view on various things, that is . why we decided to purchase them.' Sotheby's had put a pre-sale estimate of between £500,000 and £700,000 on the collection. But the sale was pulled after Indian authorities agreed to purchase the entire archive for around £700,000 (60million rupees). Sotheby's said in a statement: 'The . Gandhi-Kallenbach archive... has been sold in a private transaction to . the Indian government.' Mr Lelyvel's book caused much controversy when it was published last year. Gandhi and Kallenbach (middle row, centre) pose for a picture at Tolstoy Farm, South Africa in 1910. They became constant companions after they met in Johannesburg in 1904 . Gandhi (left) and Kallenbach  lived together for two years in a house in South Africa. Joseph Lelyveld's controversial biography Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi And His Struggle With India (right) was published last year . According to the book, Gandhi allegedly told Kallenbach: ‘How completely you have taken possession of my body. This is slavery with a vengeance.’ Kallenbach was born in Germany but emigrated to South Africa where he became a wealthy architect. Gandhi was working there and Kallenbach became one of his closest disciples. The pair lived together for two years . in a house Kallenbach built in South Africa and pledged to give one . another ‘more love, and yet more love... such love as they hope the . world has not yet seen'. At the age of 13 Gandhi had been . married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji, but after four children . together they split in 1908 so he could be with Kallenbach, the book . says. At one point he wrote to the German: . ‘Your portrait (the only one) stands on my mantelpiece in my bedroom. The mantelpiece is opposite to the bed.’ Although it is not clear why, Gandhi wrote that vaseline and cotton wool were a ‘constant reminder’ of Kallenbach. He nicknamed himself ‘Upper House’ and his lover ‘Lower House’ and he vowed to make Kallenbach promise not . to ‘look lustfully upon any woman’. 'I cannot imagine a thing as ugly as the intercourse of men and women,’ he later told him. They were separated in 1914 when . Gandhi went back to India – Kallenbach was not allowed into India . because of the First World War, after which they stayed in touch by . letter. As late as 1933 he wrote a letter telling of his unending desire and branding his ex-wife ‘the most venomous woman I have met’.","Letters between Mahatma Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach are said to shed light on their 'loving relationship'

"These adorable pictures show two kittens being nursed back to health with the help of babies' socks after being found minutes from death. The kittens, George and Elton, were found abandoned in a shed in Osterley, west London two weeks ago, severely malnourished and only a couple of weeks old. Thankfully they are now on the road to recovery - partly thanks to a pair of babies' socks and some clever thinking. Scroll down for video . Kittens George and Elton were found abandoned in a shed on August 1, just minutes from death . They wear babies' socks to keep them warm and to stop them from hurting each other - but there is only so much the vets can do to stop the cute cats from play-fighting . Since their rescue by RSPCA officers, the playful pair have been hand-reared by vet nurse Katrina Devita, who put them in the blue and white socks to keep them warm and to stop them from hurting each other. Ms Devita, based at the RSPCA's animal hospital in Putney, south-west London, has to hand-feed them every two hours, and give them lots of love and attention. Centre manager Sian Anderson said: 'You may wonder about the outfits. 'Unfortunately these two naughty boys have a habit of suckling each other in their sleep and making themselves sore. 'Our nurse came up with these fabulous outfits to help stop the habit. 'They are made from baby socks as they really are that small. As you can see they are very happy and not affected by them.' The kittens will be re-homed in a month, but vets will make sure the inseparable pair go to the same owner . One of the kittens has befriended a dog at RSPCA Putney's animal hospital, where they are recovering . Despite the vets' best efforts to stop the kittens from playing with each other, George and Elton are almost inseparable. George and Elton will be available for re-homing in around a month once they are fully weaned, but will have to be kept together because they are so close. Ms Anderson said: 'We are seeing such a high number of kittens coming into our care, and we would like to urge people to remember to get their cats neutered to try and avoid unwanted litters of kittens. 'Hand-rearing is so time intensive and our staff are overwhelmed by the sheer number of cats and kittens that need our help.' The RSPCA is urging people to adopt a kitten rather than buy one because of a surge in abandoned and neglected cats so far this year. The charity has taken 14 per cent more poorly cared for cats this year than last, and has rescued 3,306 abandoned cats so far in 2014. Ms Anderson said: 'We are seeing such a high number of kittens coming into our care, and we would like to urge people to remember to get their cats neutered to try and avoid unwanted litters of kittens.

"With a new pill that claims to boost female libido set to hit shelves in three years, two women have been at loggerheads on live television debating the pros and cons of such a medical advancement. Journalists Shona Sibary and Kelly Rose Bradford appeared on This Morning to share their thoughts on Lybrido - known informally as 'female Viagra' or 'Sheagra' - with Sibary believing no such pill could work on women as it does with men, because for females sex is too dependent on an emotional connection. Bradford, however, said women 'have a responsibility to keep their libidos high' for their partners, and believes the pill could help save floundering marriages. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kelly Rose Bradford, left, believes the female version of Viagra could help save marriages, but Shona Sibary, right, says such a pill is her worst nightmare . Dr Dawn Harper, left, explains to journalists Kelly Rose Bradford, centre, and Shona Sibary, right, why the 'female Viagra' might help save some marriages . Speaking to Dr Dawn Harper and married presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, Bradford said the pill could help women suffering from a low sex drive to stop their husbands straying. Turning to mother-of-four Sibary - who has said publicly in the past that she would 'rather mop the floor' than have sex with her husband - Bradford commented that it would 'solve all your problems'. Sibary retorted that the pill would in fact 'cover up' the problems, and would not necessarily keep her husband happy, adding: 'Would it? How nice is it for my husband to know that the only reason I'm leaping into bed with him is because I've popped a pill?' Kelly Rose Bradford, left, said the pill would solve all the marital problems of Shona Sibary, right, who has said in the past that she would rather 'mop the floor' than have sex with her husband . Dr Harper added that for a woman to lose her libido is a serious thing, but that the pill - not manufactured by the same pharmaceutical company that make Viagra - should be considered as an option only by women who are happy in their marraiges and for whom a low libido is their only complaint. Could this pill save your marriage? She said: 'I think the pill does have a place among the few women who have lost their libido and would very much like it back, but who are otherwise happy. 'There are others who have lost their libidos for different reasons - maybe they are unhappy in their marraige or don't fancy their man anymore - but that's a different issue.' Sibary said women are more complicated sexually than men, and that the pill would not stimulate females emotionally. She said: 'If you're a man and you want to have sex for the sake of . having it, fine, pop a pill and have sex in the mechanical way. 'But . women are different. I'm the type of woman this drug is targeting, and we . want to feel desirable and desired: it's not a chemical thing, it's an . emotional thing.' Dr Harper said that while Viagra's secondary, mechanical side effect was discovered while creating a pill for angina, the female libido pill works more like an anti-depressant and so does stimulate emotions.

"Files shedding new light on Marilyn Monroe's last night alive and her relationships with President John F Kennedy and his younger brother Bobby have emerged 51 years after her death. Documents belonging to the late Fred Otash, one of Hollywood's most notorious private detectives, were uncovered by his daughter Colleen after being found in a suburban storage unit. According to Otash, who died in 1992, Monroe had a sexual relationship with the brothers and complained about being 'passed around like a piece of meat'. 'Passed around': President John F Kennedy and his brother Bobby (left) with Marilyn Monroe . Otash, who had installed bugging devices in her Los Angeles home, has long been derided by Kennedy admirers for his claims to have listened to a tape of Monroe and JFK in bed together. But the notes published by The Hollywood . Reporter magazine last week contained a detailed account of his bugging . activities and what he heard. Shortly before his death, he told an . interviewer: 'They were having a sexual relationship ... but I don't . want to get into the moans and groans.' And in his notes, Otash claimed: 'I listened to Marilyn Monroe die.' He recorded that on August . 5 1962, she had a violent argument with the Kennedys and that she felt . that she had been 'passed around like a piece of meat'. The notes read: 'She was really screaming and they were trying to quiet her down. 'She's in the bedroom and Bobby gets . the pillow and he muffles her on the bed to keep the neighbors from . hearing. She finally quieted down and then he was looking to get out of . there.' Otash only found out she had died later on. Notorious: Private detective Fred Otash (right) on the stand before a state legislative committee in Los Angeles about photographs he ordered several of his employees to take of actress Anita Ekberg . Marilyn Monroe singing Happy Birthday to the President at Madison Square Gardens, in New York, in May 1962, shortly before she died . At that point Otash was the most . famous private eye in Hollywood and the first choice for any celebrity . with a potential problem. Otash, . a former Los Angeles detective, had set up his own bureau in Hollywood . where he specialised in 'fact-checking' for a celebrity gossip magazine . called Confidential. Among the stars he bugged was Rock Hudson, whose wife apparently confronted him about . his homosexuality decades before the public knew he was gay and told . him to 'grow out of it'. Hudson, who died in 1985 aged 59 due to complications related to AIDS, had been considered one of the most . desirable men of his day, starring alongside female screen . icons such as Doris Day in classics such as 'Pillow Talk'. His . other files include information on Judy Garland and how in 1963 he . cleaned her Beverly Hill apartment out of all the pills and alcohol she . had stashed during her bitter split from third husband Sid Luft. Otash died in 1992 having been used . as the inspiration for the shady PI played by Jack Nicholson in the . Oscar-winning 1974 film Chinatown. James Ellroy, the crime novelist and author of LA Confidential, who met Otash several times, turned his career into a novel, Shakedown, published online and is now writing the script for a television version. According to The Hollywood Reporter, it was the negative portrayal of Otash in Ellroy's book that persuaded Colleen to search through her father's old records and make some of them public. 'I was very aggrieved,' she said. '[I thought]: what can we do to stop [Ellroy] from taking my father's life and turning it into just a horrible fictional depiction?' The Otash notes published so far do not reveal what, if anything, the detective discovered when he searched Monroe's house and the tapes of the Hollywood star's alleged encounters with the Kennedys have never surfaced. A red filing cabinet that contained Otash's most sensitive material was removed from his apartment by his lawyer after he collapsed from an apparent heart attack. Its contents were never seen again.","Documents belong to notorious private detective Fred Otash .

"Reverend Kat Campion-Spall of St Mary's Church in Merton weeps after the session which allowed women bishops . The Church of England finally voted yesterday to let women become bishops – to the anger of many traditionalists. The move was passed by a comfortable majority at a tense gathering of its parliament, the General Synod, in York. It ended 14 years of hand-wringing and faction-fighting, delighting Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and almost all of his fellow bishops. The decision freed the Church from the risk of intervention by politicians. MPs had threatened to step in to force the Church to accept women bishops in 2012, after a disastrously botched vote saw traditionalists narrowly block reform. David Cameron described yesterday’s vote as ‘a great day for the Church and for equality’. Ed Miliband said it was ‘wonderful news’, while Nick Clegg called the decision a ‘long overdue step’. But some evangelical conservatives and Anglo-Catholics – a branch of the Church which affirms its Catholic heritage – were left divided and angry, having long argued that the Bible and tradition do not permit women to become bishops. One said he had ‘betrayed’ his supporters, while others accused Synod members of being too worried about outside reaction. Their comments provoked protests from Church liberals and left the Synod chairman, the Archbishop of York John Sentamu, calling for quiet, telling its members not to behave like rowdy MPs. The crucial vote, in which lay members of the Synod approved women bishops by a majority of more than three to one, led to clapping and a single shout of ‘brill’. Only Parliamentary formalities now remain before the Church can appoint its first female bishop. This is expected to come early next year, 21 years after women were first ordained as priests by the CofE. Scroll down for video . The vote yesterday which approved the consecration of women bishops overturned centuries of tradition . How long has the row been rumbling on? The debate over female bishops started soon after women were ordained as priests 20 years ago. The CofE set up the committees and inquiries that led to yesterday’s vote in 2000. What went on before? The vote in the General Synod that was meant to finally approve women bishops ended in narrow defeat for reformers in November 2012. Who is opposed? Anglo-catholics, who believe the Bible and tradition do not allow women bishops, and conservative evangelicals, who believe the Bible says women should not be church leaders. What is different now? In 2012, it was felt there were too few provisions for those opposed to female bishops. But Church leaders have now drawn up a new compromise, including a dispute procedure. How does the new plan work? The CofE has laid out principles saying that women shall have the full powers of male bishops and that everyone must recognise the decision. All dioceses, even those dominated by traditionalists, must include a junior bishop who will ordain and promote women. But it recognises that opponents of women bishops have the right to ‘flourish’ – so there must be ‘pastoral and sacramental provision’ for disputes. What about disputes? Church councils which oppose the move can send their bishop a resolution stating that they do not want a woman vicar or clergy, nor any male priests who have been ordained by women bishops. They should then be sent male clergy when jobs become vacant. If an objecting parish is in a diocese run by a woman bishop, she will allow it to be supervised by a male junior bishop. If no junior bishop is available within the diocese, one can be brought in from outside. What if there are still arguments? There will be an appeals system, in which parishes can turn to an ‘independent reviewer’. But if a parish does not accept an appeal decision they can be subject to disciplinary action, which can culminate in dismissal from the Church. Sally Barnes, pictured right, is overwhelmed with emotion beside Hilary Cotton after the Synod in York . The first appointment may be seen as an anti-climax, with a woman picked to fill a junior post, subordinate to a male bishop. After . the vote, the Archbishop of York led the General Synod in a rendition . of We are Marching in the Light of God, with members clapping along, . some even shedding tears of joy. Reverend . Dr Rosemarie Mallett, from Southwark diocese, said yesterday: ‘I’m . absolutely joyful, thank God after 20 years of very hard work we now . have a decision that can help us work for everyone in the Church. Yesterday’s vote came nearly 20 months after the Church’s last attempt to approve a law allowing women bishops. The lost Synod vote in November 2012 left the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, humiliated and apparently with little hope of reviving the cause for several years. But a new compromise, which allows scope for traditionalists to challenge the appointment of a female bishop in their parish, was brought to the vote in record time. The plan is based on the hope of compromise between opposing liberals and conservatives. Archbishop Welby said CofE members must ‘continue to demonstrate love for those who disagree on theological grounds’. He added: ‘As delighted as I am for the outcome of this vote I am also mindful of those within the Church for whom the result will be difficult and a cause of sorrow.’ During the debate, Guildford traditionalist Adrian Vincent said he would reverse his position from 2012 and vote in favour. ‘By doing so, I am betraying what I believe, I am betraying those who trusted in me,’ he said. ‘I hope that the promised commitment to mutual flourishing is not a commitment that will run out of steam in a few years.’ But opponent Dr Chik Kaw Tan, of Lichfield, said: ‘Men and women are equal but their roles are not interchangeable ... if we allow the Church to be guided by secular thinking our teaching will soon unravel.’ In 2012, the House of Laity voted just six short of the necessary two to one majority. Yesterday, it voted 152 to 45 for women bishops. Members of the clergy arrive for the General Synod of Church of England meeting at The University of York .

"Older people have been warned about the dangers of excessive drinking after figures showed the number suffering alcohol-related mental-health problems has rocketed by 150 per cent in a decade. The latest research on the  over-60s, published today, raises  concerns that the baby-boomer generation is failing to acknowledge the damaging effects of long-term drinking. A new study found alcohol is causing a rise in the numbers diagnosed with dementia. Experts say the figures confirm an epidemic of late-onset drinking during retirement and following bereavement. The number of elderly people diagnosed with dementia caused by excessive alcohol consumption has soared in the last decade . And it appears the wealthiest are drinking the most. In London,  the greatest number of hospital admissions are in some of the most affluent areas, including Kensington and Islington. Eric Appleby, chief executive  of Alcohol Concern, said those born between 1947 and 1964 had grown up with a more liberal approach to alcohol. He added: ‘This is a wake-up call – we’re drinking too much, too often and we’re paying the price for this with our mental and physical well-being.’ Alcohol concern say that the elderly need to be more aware of the dangers of alcohol  after the number of those with mental disorders went up . The new study was carried out by Dr Tony Rao, a consultant psychiatrist at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, and examined trends in hospital admissions in England for those aged between 60 and 74. He found the number of admissions for people with behavioural and mental disorders linked to alcohol use had gone from 3,247 in 2002 to 8,120 in 2012 – a 150 per cent rise. The cost of admissions linked to heavy drinking among 55 to 74-year-olds last year was more than £825 million, according to Alcohol Concern. That figure is ten times the cost of treating younger people.","The number of elderly patients with alcohol related dementia has soared .

Attendees were also captured by checking out multiple structures and sites on the festival grounds - including a giant boat in the desert and the so-called 'Temple of Grace' - by Reuters. On Friday morning, a project almost 12 months in the making called Embrace - a 72-foot wooden sculpture of two people lovingly looking into each other, built across studios in Vancouver and Portland - was reduced to nothing but dust and ash.

Later in the day, thousands of the almost 70,000-strong crowd gathered at Embrace to watch as the first of this year's sculptures was burned, taking a moment to remember Cipicchio. Schultz said on the Embrace website the design of the piece was supposed to be hopeful. 'It’s not all about sorrow. It’s also about appreciating the relationships in your life,' he said.

"Most new fathers feel so clueless when it comes to newborn babies that they are anxious when first handed their own child after birth. Moreover, as many as one in five British fathers admit never having held a baby before their own was placed in their arms - and 30 per cent say they have no idea at all how to hold an infant. This has led to 90 per cent of men confessing they were desperate for more practical parenting information to have been available when their children were born, according to research by Persil. Former England rugby player Ben Cohen, left, has teamed up with Persil on the Cuddle Mastery Guide to teach new fathers how to handle their newborn babies . One in five British fathers admit never having held a baby before their own was placed in their arms . In contrast to new mothers, dads admit feeling inexperienced, suffering a confidence crises when their baby arrives. Compared to women, it takes 19 per cent of new fathers an . average of one week to feel comfortable holding their little one, while . 62 per cent of new mothers feel it is a natural instinct from day one. And 60 per cent of new dads admit their lack of knowledge left them feeling anxious as they were handed their youngster. The study, carried out by Persil Non-Bio and Comfort Pure, has led to the brand teaming up with England rugby player and father of twin girls Ben Cohen, 34, to create the Cuddle Mastery Guide. It takes 19 per cent of new fathers an average of one week to feel comfortable holding their little one, while 62 per cent of new mothers feel it is a natural instinct from day one . Endorsed by the British Skin Foundation, the guide provides tips and examples for new parents. Cohen emphasised the need for new mums and dads to conquer their anxieties about holding newborns. He said: 'I want to encourage new parents to overcome their nervousness. As a father of two twin daughters, I know it can be intimidating when you first meet your little one. 'But spending that quality time with them learning how to cuddle and reading up beforehand really helps to increase your confidence.' The study found 40 per cent of dads are not left alone with their baby in the first week after their birth. However, many fathers are more likely to cover the night feed, which is when they begin to bond with their baby. Ben Cohen cradling one of his twin daughters, Isabelle, when she was five months old, as part of the Problem Shared campaign supporting first-time fathers in 2008 . Meanwhile, more than half of all new parents (57 per cent) admit feeling uncomfortable letting friends and family hold their newborn. Jean Robinson, a children's dermatology nurse and trustee for the British Skin Foundation, has stressed the importance of forming close bonds early-on. She said: 'The quality of parent-baby relationships influences your baby's physical and mental development, so it's very important to get it right from the beginning. 'Babies who are given lots of cuddles and love and affection may find stress or anxiety easier to deal with as they grow up.' Ben Cohen said: 'I want to encourage new parents to overcome their nervousness.

"Nelson Mandela is 'in good shape' and 'good spirits', South African president Jacob Zuma said today. He spoke as the first footage emerged of the 94-year-old former president since he left hospital on April 6 after suffering from pneumonia. He spent 10 days in hospital being treated for the illness, which followed an earlier hospitalisation in December when he developed a lung infection and gallstones. Scroll down for video . Recovering: Nelson Mandela was said to be in 'good spirits' but appeared expressionless on camera . Motionless: Mandela sat up in an armchair with the aid of a cushion, but appeared not to interact with the people around him . Keeping positive: South African president Jacob Zuma (left) said he was 'really happy' with Mandela's progress. However, this footage caused a storm of outrage in South Africa . Icon: Mandela was South Africa's first black president and is seen by many as the father of the nation . The video shows Mandela sitting upright in an armchair, surrounded by friends, family, politicians and medical staff at his home in Johannesburg. It is the first public image of him since Hillary Clinton visited in her role as US secretary of state in August. Mandela - also known as Madiba in South Africa - appears to be virtually expressionless and does not seem to react to those around him. He is wearing a flamboyant black and white shirt, with a white blanket covering his legs. He looks thinner than usual and pale, with marks on his cheeks that appear to be from a recently removed oxygen mask. But President Zuma insisted he was doing well. Speaking on the doorstep of Mandela's home, he told SABC News: 'The doctors gave us a report and of . course we saw him. He is looking very good, he is in good shape. We had . some conversation with him, we shook hands, we smiled. 'As you can see he . is really up and about and stablised. We're really very happy. We think that . he is fine.' On the mend: The former president is being cared for by a large team of medical experts . Back home: Mandela spent 10 days in hospital earlier this month after coming down with pneumonia . In the video, Zuma jokes and laughs with two officials of the governing African National Congress, some Mandela family members and the former president's medical team, while Mandela stares straight ahead. One of his grandsons cries 'Smile, smile,' as he takes a picture on his mobile phone. He attempts a weak smile but, as the flash goes off, he closes his eyes and purses his lips. The former president is known to dislike camera flashes, as his eyes are sensitive after years of working in the glare of a limestone quarry when he was imprisoned on Robben Island. In a statement, the ANC said Mandela was 'keenly . aware of the goodwill that has been outpouring from the peoples of the . globe as befitting his status as our icon'. The Nobel Peace laureate was imprisoned for 27 years during the apartheid era became the first democratically elected president of South Africa in 1994.

"The U.S. soldier accused of killing 17 Afghan civilians did not act alone, according to survivors of the massacre earlier this month. Army Staff Sgt Robert Bales has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and is being held in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The Pentagon insists he had no accomplices. However, several survivors claim to have seen more than one American soldier, and as many as 20, during the atrocity earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Did he have accomplices? Several survivors claim Staff Sgt Robert Bales (left) did not act alone during the massacre of 17 Afghan villagers earlier this month . One mother-of-six, whose husband was killed during the incident, believes there were as many as 20 people involved. She told SBS Dateline journalist Yalda Hakim: 'When they shot dead my husband, I tried to drag him into the house, they'd shot him in the head so his brain was all over my hands. I had to use a bowl for his blood. 'I saw more than 20 people when I looked out the house. The Americans pointed their guns at me and threatened me, telling me not to leave the house or they'd kill me.' Another witness, an eight-year-old girl called Noorbinak, said a gunman shot her family's dog before shooting her father in the foot and dragging her mother by the hair. When her father screamed, he was shot dead, before the gunman shot Noorbinak in the leg. She said: 'One man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard, holding lights.' The brother of another victim claimed . that his nephews and nieces saw numerous soldiers involved in the . assault, all wearing headlamps and with lights strapped to the ends of . their guns. He said: 'They don’t know whether there were 15 or 20, however many there were.' 'Depression and anxiety': Bales suffered trauma that set him into depression and anxiety, his lawyer claimed . Afghan President Hamid Karzai has appointed General Sher Mohammad Karimi to investigate persistent claims by locals that Bales did not act alone - and that he even had the support of U.S. helicopters. General Karimi told Hakim: 'What they claim is that there were boot prints in the area, in some area they see the kneeling position of three, four individuals, and also they claim that the helicopters were there to support the operations. 'I told them the helicopters were used when the guy went missing when they were searching for him. They said: ""No, the noise of the helicopters were from the very beginning when the shooting started."" 'So, that means there were many Americans who were supporting this issue that were doing this deliberately it is not an individual. So, that is the claim of the people.' It is also claimed that an Afghan guard alerted the U.S. authorities to the unusual behaviour of an American soldier that night after spotting him entering Camp Balambai at 1.30am, shortly after the first killings in Alkozai village. Despite the warning, Bales is said to have remained at the camp for an hour before setting off for the village of Najiban to carry out more killings. Tragedy: Bales is accused of shooting 17 Afghans, including nine children like this one being shown by her grandmother, and setting many of them on fire . 'Difficult case to prove': Attorney John Henry Browne said a defence team for Bales is in Afghanistan collecting evidence and conducting interviews . Bales suffered a traumatic incident during his second tour in Iraq that triggered 'tremendous depression,' his lawyer said on Wednesday. John Browne expects the issue to become a focal point in the case against the army sergeant. But he said he could not discuss the details of the matter because it remains classified. Mr Browne said: 'It caused him tremendous depression and anxiety.' The lawyer previously said Bales experienced other major dangers in his deployments, including a serious foot injury and head trauma. In addition, a fellow soldier's leg had been blown off days before the Afghanistan massacre, he said. A defence team is now in Afghanistan to collect evidence and interview other U.S. soldiers who knew Bales. Mr Browne, who is not part of the team in Afghanistan, said: 'Everyone they've spoken to in the military has nothing but amazingly positive things to say about him.' Due to security concerns, Mr Browne doesn't think the team will visit the villages where the killings occurred. The investigators are likely to stay in Afghanistan for a few more weeks. Mr Browne questioned the U.S. government's case against Bales, noting there is no preserved crime scene to assess. He said: 'It's going to be a difficult case for the prosecution to prove. There's no ""CSI"" information. There's no DNA that I know of. There's no ballistics that I know of.' 'Unbelievable': Bales' wife Karilyn has said she doesn't believe the charges against her husband and will stand by him . Bales has indicated that he had no recollection of prescription drugs he may have been taking before the shooting - something the attorney took as an indicator of larger memory problems. The lawyer also said his client has a sketchy memory of the night of the shootings. In a separate interview with The Washington Post, Mr Browne said that Bales remembered the smell of gunfire and of human bodies but not much more. Mr Browne added his client reported suffering from nightmares, flashbacks of war scenes and persistent headaches after his multiple combat tours. Bales told his legal team that he has long woken up with night sweats and often replays memories of a grisly scene in Iraq that he and his infantry company witnessed several years ago. The lawyer stressed that Bales did not confess and seemed surprised when his weapon was taken away, the newspaper reported. U.S. military officials said Bales was drinking on a southern Afghanistan base on March 11 before creeping away to two villages at night, shooting his victims and setting many of them on fire. Nine were children. Bales has had incidents involving alcohol and violence in the past. In 2002, he was arrested for a drunken assault of a security guard at a Tacoma, Washington, casino. That charge was dismissed after Bales completed 20 hours of anger management training. In 2008, a couple accused an intoxicated Bales of grabbing a woman's hand and thrusting it toward his crotch before kicking and punching the woman's boyfriend, according to a police report. Prosecutors declined to pursue that case.","Pentagon insists Staff Sgt Robert Bales did not have any accomplices .

"Living near parks and green spaces in town and cities boosts your mental well-being. Not only does moving to a greener area improves mental health, but the effect continues long after you have moved. The research by the University of Exeter Medical School is one of the first studies to consider the effects of green space over time and its result could lead to town planners including green spaces in new developments. Living near parks and green spaces in town and cities boosts your mental well-being . The study traced participants over five years and used data from the British Household Panel Survey, information gathered from questionnaires filled in by households across Great Britain. Using data from more than 1,000 participants, the study focused on two groups of people, those who moved to greener urban areas and those who relocated to less green urban areas. On average movers to greener areas experienced an immediate improvement in mental health that was sustained for at least three years after they moved. The study, published in the journal of Environmental Science & Technology, also showed that people relocating to more built up areas suffered a decline in mental health. Interestingly this fall occurred before they moved and returning to normal once the move was complete. On average movers to greener areas experienced an immediate improvement in mental health . The authors adjusted their data to remove effects from other factors likely to affect mental health over time - such as income, employment and education - as well as factors related to personality. Dr Ian Alcock said: 'We've shown that individuals who move to greener areas have significant and long-lasting improvements in mental health. 'These findings are important for urban planners thinking about introducing new green spaces to our towns and cities, suggesting they could provide long term and sustained benefits for local communities.' In 2012 the World Health Organisation cited depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide, and this study builds on research that has found natural environments could act as vital resources to improve health and wellbeing. Yet up until now, scientists have been unsure how these effects vary over time. Co-author Dr Mathew White added: 'We needed to answer important questions about how the effects of green space vary over time. 'Do people experience a novelty effect, enjoying the new green area after the move, but with the novelty then wearing off? 'Or do they take time to realise the benefits of their new surroundings as they gradually get to know local parks? 'What we've found suggests that the mental health benefits of green space are not only immediate, but sustainable over long periods of time.'","The research was carried out by the University of Exeter Medical School .

"'Piles and piles' of bodies were left at a mosque in South Sudan after gunmen killed 200 civilians and wounded 400 others, a top United Nations official has said. Many victims of the ethnically-targeted massacre in the provincial capital Bentiu were children and the elderly, according to a damning report. UN humanitarian official Toby Lanzer added the killings last week were 'possibly a game-changer' in the four-month conflict and disturbing echoes of the Rwandan genocide had emerged. It is claimed rebels have used radio broadcasts to incite men to rape women of different ethnic backgrounds - similarly to the run-up to the 1994 genocide in which up to a million died. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Fleeing the violence: Men, women and children are fleeing the state capital of Bentiu in South Sudan after rebel gunmen reportedly burst into a mosque last week, killing 200 people and leaving 'piles and piles' of bodies . Game-changer: People fleeing near Bentiu. It is claimed messages have been broadcast over the radio inciting men to rape women from different ethnic backgrounds in a disturbing echo of the Rwandan genocide . 'It's the first time we're aware of that a . local radio station was broadcasting hate messages encouraging people . to engage in atrocities,' said Mr Lanzer, the top humanitarian official in South Sudan. 'That really accelerates . South Sudan's descent into an even more difficult situation from which . it needs to extract itself.' Human rights investigators said hundreds of civilians were killed between April 15 and 17 when rebel forces seized Bentiu, the oil-rich capital of Unity state. The oil fields are crucial to both sides because South Sudan, the world's youngest country which only formed in 2011, gains 90 per cent of all its income from oil sales. Reports said the rebel forces were Nuer people from the Sudan People's Liberation Army, who count ousted former vice president Riek Machar among their number. The UN said they targeted non-Nuer citizens for their ethnicity - claims the rebels denied. Rebel fighter Brig Lul Ruai Koang told the BBC government allies could have engineered the slaughter as a PR exercise, saying: 'Our forces are not responsible for killing civilians anywhere in Bentiu.' Full to bursting: More than 25,000 civilians have fled to the UN camp in Bentiu, where there is just a litre of water per person per day and one toilet per 350 people. Officials warn people will die within days . Leaving: A woman carries her belongings as she flees from renewed attacks in Bentiu. The UN said there have been 'widespread human rights violations committed by both sides, not only in Bentiu, but in all areas' The world's youngest country gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after being blighted for decades by ethnic violence. But tensions rose in July last year when President Salva Kiir dismissed members of his own government, including vice president Riek Machar. An argument began in the capital Juba on December 15 between soldiers loyal to the President - one of the Dinka people - and his ousted deputy, one of the Nuer people. It soon spread to full-blown fighting and similar violence erupted elsewhere as the President accused Machar of attempting a coup. But the UN said there have been 'widespread human rights violations committed by both sides, not only in Bentiu, but in all areas affected by the ongoing conflict.' Survivors of last week's massacre claimed they were told that entering the mosque would mean they were safe. But once inside they were robbed of money and mobile phones before all non-Nuer people were mercilessly gunned down, with children and the elderly not spared from the violence. Mr . Gorgeu said his team members in Bentiu, including 12 international . staff, have treated more than 200 people wounded in the violence, . including many gunshot victims. British . Ambassador Ian Hughes said the killings were a clear . violation of international law and those behind the atrocities will be held to account. He extended that warning to those inciting violence over the radio. The UN report said: 'While some opposition commanders did broadcast messages calling for unity and an end to tribalism, others broadcast hate messages declaring that certain ethnic groups should not stay in Bentiu and even calling on men from one community to commit vengeful sexual violence against women from another community.' Slaughter: Two bodies on the road near Bentiu. Survivors of the mosque attack said they were assured they would be safe before being robbed of money and mobile phones and mercilessly gunned down . Civil war: Bodies near Bentiu. The conflict began in December after the President Salva Kiir, one of the Dinki people, dismissed several colleagues including his vice president, who is from the rival Nuer ethnic group . A million people have fled their homes since the civil war broke out in mid-December. Thousands of civilians from several ethnic groups have streamed to the UN peacekeeping base in Bentiu over the last week because many believe more violence is coming. The base now holds 25,000 people but has just a litre of water per person per day and only one toilet per 350 people. Mr Lanzer said: The risk of a public health crisis inside our base is enormous.' Raphael Gorgeu, the head of Doctors Without Borders in South Sudan, said people will die inside the UN base in coming days because of the poor sanitation and lack of water. The fighting also means tens of thousands of farmers have abandoned their crops. That means there is a severe risk of famine later this year because civilians would normally be planting in April and May, Mr Lanzer said. Gruesome: Photos emerging from Bentiu feature piles of bodies which are too shocking to show . Scene of the massacre: The location of Bentiu in the north of newly-created nation South Sudan . The UN has not spelled out clearly who exactly the victims were last week, but because ethnic Nuers carried out the killings it is likely that ethnic Dinkas were among the dead. The UN also said former residents of the Darfur region of Sudan were among those killed. Nuer residents who refused to take part in the attacks were also killed. Though thousands of people are cramming into the UN base in search of shelter, they may not even be safe there. Last week an angry mob attacked a UN base in Bor and killed about 60 people. In that case, ethnic Nuers sheltering inside bore the brunt of the attack. Mr Gorgeu said such a potential attack is a major concern for the safety of his staff but that he cannot abandon the civilians in need. He said: 'All this violence, if you look at Bor, if you look at Bentiu, it's a major, major concern. We can see the level of violence is having an unacceptably high cost on the civilian population and this must be addressed.'","UN report: 200 civilians were killed at mosque in provincial capital Bentiu .

"Disgraced senator John Edwards today denied allegations he had any involvement with one of the high-class hookers working for alleged Manhattan Madam Anna Gristina after it was claimed he paid for sex while in New York during his presidential bid in 2007. Edwards is the first high-profile name to come out of Gristina's alleged black book of clients after he was identified today by the website that originally exposed the prostitution ring scandal. Anna Gristina, 44, from Monroe County, was arrested on February 23 accused of running a million-dollar brothel empire for the last 15 years for wealthy and powerful clients - who are said to be panicking they may be outed ever since. Outed: Former senator John Edwards is the first name to be revealed from the Manhattan Madam's 'Black Book' of clients who allegedly had sexual trysts with her high-class hookers . In the dock: Alleged madam Anna Gristina said she would rather bite off her tongue than name any names . The former senator's attorney . released a statement on behalf of his client today saying: 'Mr Edwards . categorically denies that he was involved with any prostitute or any . such service. These allegations are false and defamatory and will put . those who publish or report them on notice that they are acting with . actual malice by reporting or repeating them.' He is in the process of demanding a complete retraction from DNAInfo, who first reported the accusations. Sources claimed to the website that the former senator spent one night with the call girl while he was in New York raising money for his campaign, before his shameful and public fall from grace after his affair with videographer Rielle Hunter was exposed. It is the latest in a long line of scandals to hit the 58-year-old since his extra-marital affair and subsequent love child were discovered. When the National Enquirer broke the story about the affair, Edwards released a similar denial calling the claims 'false, completely untrue and ridiculous'. Front: During his campaign, Edwards portrayed himself as a devoted family man, right, while Anna Gristina has presented herself as a soccer mom and animal lover who lives a quiet life with her husband, right . The prostitute is said to have given . investigators a detailed account of her alleged tryst with Edwards in . 2008 after the Manhattan's DA office were first tipped off about . Gristina's prostitution ring. February 22 - Anna Gristina is arrested while meeting with a Morgan Stanley banker allegedly regarding an online prostitution service . March 5 - Gristina makes first appearance in court and is denied bail, which stands at $2million. Also revealed that Jaynie Mae Baker is wanted as an accomplice . March 7 - Morgan Stanley banker David Walker suspended from work pending investigation . March 8 - Sources claim Eliot Spitzer tipped off Gristina in 2005 during prostitution sting. 'Madam' makes second appearance in court and is denied bail again . March 10 - Former NYPD cop Sly Francis outed as alleged madam's former bodyguard . March 12 - Gristina in court again as attorney puts up $2.5million loft as collateral. Bail denied for third time . March 13 - Jaynie Mae Baker finally turns herself in, appears in court and released on $100k bond . March 16 - The arrests of three more people revealed, including two high-class call girls - Mhairiangelo Bottone and Catherine DeVries - and Jonas Gayer, who is accused of helping Gristina launder money . March 22 - John Edwards named as alleged client . The source claimed: 'Most of the women don’t have any idea . about the identities of the men they sleep with. How would they know a money man from Wall Street or the face of a . lawyer or banker who shows up? 'But the face of the national politician? She knew.' An aide of the former Democratic presidential hopeful familiar with Gristina's operation allegedly organised the fling, which is claimed to have taken place at an Upper East Side hotel rather than the alleged brothel. During his trips to the city, Edwards usually stayed at the plush Loews Hotels Regency - on the Upper East Side -  the same hotel he met Rielle Hunter. The 58-year-old is currently waiting to face federal trial in . North Carolina, which has been postponed until March 26 due to a serious heart . condition he is said to be suffering from. He is accused of . using nearly $1million in campaign donations to cover up his affair and . love child with Hunter during his 2008 run for president while his wife was battling with cancer. Each of the six counts he is charged with carries a maximum five-year prison term and $250,000 fine. At the time the hooker was . questioned, investigators allegedly found her to be a 'credible witness' but they did not . see a reason to notify the feds during a time when Edwards' campaign . trail was at its peak and he was seen as a family man with a squeaky-clean image, according to the source. They confirmed he was in New York raising money at the time of the alleged encounter. Base: During his campaign trail, Edwards often stayed at the Loews Hotels Regency in Manhattan's Upper East Side - the same area of New York the call girl alleged she had a fling with Edwards . New York: The madam's alleged brothel was also in the Upper East Side of the city but a far cry from the plush surroundings enjoyed at the Loews Hotels Regency . When she was interviewed in Rikers Island prison, where she is being held on $2million bond, Gristina said she would rather bite her own tongue off than tell authorities anything, after they presented her with a list of ten names. Secrets: During his campaign trail, Edwards had an affair with videographer Rielle Hunter and they have a child together . A judge has three times refused her bail as she is considered a high-flight risk. It is believed that because she has a British passport and a home in Canada, she would flee the country with the help of wealthy clients who are trying everything to avoid their names being leaked. Sources told DNAinfo that the Millionaire Madam’s 'black book' of clients included, a Middle Eastern sheik, an international . billionaire financier, a nightclub impresario, dozens of Wall Street . hedge fund and investment bankers, and a network of lawyers. Gristina, a suburban soccer mom who moved to New York 20 years ago from her native Edinburgh, was arrested after a five-year investigation during which undercover police taped more than 100 hours of audio where she bragged about her high-end clients, how she had contacts in law enforcement who would tip her off and even how she used underage girls for some of the trysts, according to explosive court documents. The divorcee lives in suburban Monroe, north of New York City, with her children and a number of rescue animals. The five-year-long investigation was run by a Manhattan district attorney's office unit that pursues cases against police and other uniformed city workers, according to a transcript of her February 23 arraignment. During hundreds of hours of . surveillance, Gristina was heard saying that 'she has connections in law . enforcement who are poised to help her out, to let her know if there is . trouble on the front that she needs to be concerned about', District . Attorney Charles Linehan said, according to the court transcript. Neighbours . say a steady stream of young women - usually of Eastern European . descent - would come and go from the second-floor apartment, as did a . number of suited business men. In the weeks after Gristina was arrested, Eliot Spitzer was accused of tipping the madam off in 2005 about a crackdown on impending brothels in the city. He was also accused of being a client. Kristin Davis, who ran a Manhattan call-girl service used by the disgraced former governor, said she shared a booker with Gristina who told her about Spitzer's alleged warning. It was said to have prompted her to shut down her agency Fleur d' Elite and skip the country. Also arrested was Jaynie Mae Baker, . said to have been an accomplice of Gristina's, who allegedly found . wealthy clients to pair with the high-class hookers. The 30-year-old, from Brooklyn, was on the run for three weeks before handing herself into police.

The two women charged with prostitution, Mhairiangelo Bottone and Catherine DeVries, pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charge. The man accused of laundering money, named Jonas Gayer but identified in court papers only as John Doe, has been facing charges for two years or more, according to court records.","A call girl told investigators she had a one-night fling with Edwards in 2007 when he was in New York during his presidential campaign .

"Harry Kane has rivalled one of the world's best players by scoring eight goals in 10 games this year . Former Tottenham chairman Lord Alan Sugar insists the club will be powerless to prevent Harry Kane from leaving White Hart Lane amid interest from Real Madrid. The 21-year-old former academy striker has arguably been this season's Premier League revelation - scoring 23 goals in all competitions to earn the trust of manager Mauricio Pochettino and stand on the verge of a first England call. Kane - who inspired Spurs to a 2-1 victory over north London rivals Arsenal at the weekend - has recently signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal, but has emerged as a target for La Liga leaders Real Madrid. Harry Kane celebrates scoring his 23rd goal of the season against Liverpool on Tuesday . Former Tottenham chairman Lord Alan Sugar is not confident that Spurs will keep hold of Kane . Gareth Bale (left) left White Hart Lane for the Bernabeu in a world record £86m transfer deal in 2013 . And, Sugar believes that there is nothing Tottenham will be able to do should Kane decide to follow world record transfer Gareth Bale to the Bernabeu. 'You don't have to accept any sort of money for a player,' he told talkSPORT. 'The big issue people miss out is the untenable pressure that is placed upon a club when a player wants to leave. Then the money becomes irrelevant. Keane inspired Tottenham to victory over rivals Arsenal in the north London derby . Spurs have sold big name players including (L-R) Luka Modric, Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Carrick . 'In the case of Gareth Bale there must have been conversations where Tottenham said, 'If it's down to money, then let's have a chat'. It wasn't that though, he was given the chance to play for Real Madrid. 'That's why most players leave, just look at Michael Carrick, Dimitar Berbatov and Luka Modric. 'Harry Kane allegedly says he wants to be at the club for the rest of his life, like Matt Le Tissier at Southampton. Let us hope he is but let's be under no illusion. He will be the one that controls that.'","Harry Kane has scored 23 goals in all competitions this season .

"There was no roar from the engine as this super-charged sports car topped 150mph on its record-breaking run yesterday. Only the relatively gentle sound of tyre rolling over road disturbed the peace and quiet as the UK land speed record for an electric car was shattered. The team behind a supercar powered by energy from wind turbines believe they have smashed the UK land-speed record for an electric car. Their recorded speed of 148.7mph breaks the record of 137mph set by Don Wales, the grandson of speed ace Sir Malcolm Campbell, 10 years ago. Scroll down for video . The Nemesis, driven by Nick Ponting, 21, hit 148.7mph - breaking the 137mph set by Don Wales, the grandson of speed ace Sir Malcolm Campbell, 10 years ago . Journey complete: Driver Nick Ponting and Dale Vince of Ecotricity with the Nemesis electric car after breaking the land speed record for an electric car at Elvington airfield in Yorkshire . The Nemesis, driven by Nick Ponting, 21, hit 148.7mph during a run at Elvington airfield, near York, today. But today’s achievement still needs to be ratified by the Motor Sports Association before the record can be officially declared. The makers of the Nemesis say it is the first electric supercar to be built in the UK and they hope it will 'smash the stereotype' of electric-powered cars as boring and slow. It is the brainchild of Dale Vince, founder of green electricity company Ecotricity, of Stroud, Gloucestershire. Now called 'the Nemesis', the car was originally a second-hand Lotus Exige which was bought on eBay for £10,000. Another £750,000 was spent modifying the car over a two-and-a-half year period with the aim of changing the image of electric vehicles. Stereotype smash: The team home the Nemesis will put paid to the stereotype that electric cars are 'boring' Powered by battery using electricity from wind turbines, the car averaged 151 mph over two runs of the one mile course. Mr Vince has said: 'We built the . Nemesis to smash the stereotype of electric cars as something Noddy . would drive - slow, boring, not cool.' Mr . Vince said the Nemesis is powered entirely by electricity generated by . Ecotricity’s network of 53 wind turbines around the UK. It was designed and built in less than two years by a team of leading British motorsport engineers in Norfolk. Mr Vince said he wanted to stimulate a debate about how everyone will move around when the world runs out of oil. He said the Nemesis is capable of 0-100mph in 8.5 seconds and, on paper, is capable of topping 200mph. The Nemesis can travel from 100-150 miles between charges, depending on driving style, and can be charged from empty in less than 30 minutes. Mr Ponting, who lives in Gloucester and works for an estate agency in Stroud, has had many years of experience racing a range of cars since his early teens. He said the amazing thing about the car was its consistent acceleration at all speeds. Last summer Mr Wales attempted to break his own record but ran into trouble on the beach at Pendine Sands in Carmarthenshire.
