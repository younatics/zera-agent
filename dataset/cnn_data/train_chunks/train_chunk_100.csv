"(CNN) -- Mumbai is extreme India. In this booming metropolis all the wealth, inequalities, colors, flavors and passions of India are magnified to an almost unbearable degree. For many Indians, Mumbai is the place where dreams can come true. Somewhere between 13 and 20 million people are squeezed into the city that is India's leading financial and industrial center and the home of the Bollywood movie. For countless migrants from all over the country, be they business school graduates, aspiring actors or destitute laborers, Mumbai is the place where dreams can come true. Those who like to think of India as a land of tradition and mystery would be shocked by the way modern Mumbai has embraced western consumerism. In Mumbai the rigidities of India's traditional caste system are being replaced by a kind of brutal meritocracy in which the winners become extraordinarily rich and the losers struggle for survival. While Mumbai is fearlessly embracing modernity, minting millionaires and erecting skyscrapers, its infrastructure is hopelessly outdated and creaking under the weight of the city's ever-expanding population. Mumbai's road traffic is legendary -- a chaotic melange of cars, mopeds, motorized rickshaws and red double-decker buses, seemingly fused together in a writhing, gridlocked mass. All big cities have deprived areas, but in Mumbai the deprivation is impossible to avoid. Up to half of Mumbai's residents live in slums, about a million in the shacks of Dharavi, the biggest slum in Asia. In these cities within a city children play next to the sewers that run through the streets, whole families often live in a single room and clean water is scarce. Yet while the slums can be grindingly poor, they are also buzzing with activity. Many residents of Dharavi work in cottage industries and in the thriving recycling trade, and their biggest threats are the annual monsoon floods and the developers eager to clear the slum in order to exploit the prime real estate it occupies. For outsiders, the contrast between rich and poor can be jarring, but Mumbaikars have learned to live with adversity. While the Mumbai terror attacks of November 2008 horrified the world, the killings were tragically familiar to those living in a city where hundreds have been killed by terrorists over the last 15 years and religious and social tensions simmer beneath the surface. Yet, despite its very visible problems, Mumbai simply will not be denied. Constantly growing in population and wealth, Mumbai is a world-class city when it comes to culture, commerce and consumption. Mumbaikars are incredibly enterprising and their ability to bounce back from tragedy is testimony to their resourcefulness and resilience. Danny Boyle, director of award-winning movie ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" set and filmed in Mumbai, said of the city, ""Despite all that has happened there recently it is a city moving towards happiness. ""You have these incredible extremes but it feels like there's a destiny that binds it all together.""","Mumbai is fearlessly embracing modernity and western consumerism .

"(CNN) -- Forget almost everything you ever thought you knew about the moon. NASA's latest missions indicate the moon is much more than a dead, unchanging satellite orbiting Earth. It's a dynamic environment, with changes occurring by the day and week, not over millions of years. The space agency says the missions are rewriting lunar science text books and revolutionizing what scientists know about Earth's closest neighbor. An announcement in November probably rivaled Neil Armstrong's first steps on the surface more than 40 years earlier: There's water on the moon. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or L-CROSS, and its companion spacecraft crashed into a crater at the moon's south pole in October and discovered water in a very dark and very cold place. L-CROSS researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater, which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep. Michael Wargo, NASA'S chief lunar scientist on the L-CROSS mission, said the probes detected more than water in the crater, but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is. ""We're opening new chapters. And in fact, because some of this information is so new and it's so different from the way we use to think about the moon, there are chapters that are blank right now,"" he said. You know that they're going to written, but we don't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information."" Wargo describes the lunar data as a treasure trove. The moon ""is like the dusty attic of the solar system, in that things get collected there and they give you insight, not just into the moon, but the evolution of the solar system."" Earthbound explorations, such as Lewis and Clark's historic journey to the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century, carry critically necessary items, but they have no need to haul wood or water. That's not so for manned space flight. Those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet's surface. The presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond. NASA is also mapping the moon's surface in unprecedented detail, eventually creating the first moon atlas. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched last summer, is the robotic scout that is providing the data. LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit. Wargo said LRO is carrying high-resolution cameras, which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon, including the Apollo mission landing sites. ""We have cameras on board that have been able to image where the Apollo spacecraft landed, and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages, where the astronauts walked on the moon,"" according to Wargo. The LRO discovered it's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters, where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, or 249 degrees below zero Celsius. That's not far from absolute zero, defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached. These are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system. The LRO is also measuring space radiation on the moon. Astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations. All this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020, the the target date set by the Bush administration in 2004. But it's more than that. Wargo sum it up this way: . ""We used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place, that the moon was a dead planet. ... There are changes that occur there not over the course of thousands or millions or even billions of years, but are changing over the course of days and weeks and months. That's something people just hadn't thought of until just weeks and months ago. ... This isn't your grandfather's moon anymore.""","NASA's latest missions indicate the moon has changes occurring by the day and week .

"Penuelas, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Jorelys Rivera, the 7-year-old girl who was abducted and killed early this month near her north Georgia home, was buried Tuesday in a service in this town on the southern coast of Puerto Rico. Hundreds of mourners filled the funeral home and spilled out the doors for the service. Afterward, the carriage holding holding her body was pulled by horses -- her favorite animal -- to the cemetery. The 1- to 2-kilometer (1-mile) route to the cemetery was lined with people, many of whom said they had not known the girl or her family, but were there simply because they had been moved by her story. Mayor Walter Torres paid the cost of the service. As a four-person group played traditional Puerto Rican and Christmas music, Jorelys' mother Joseline appeared calm and solemn.The girl's father, Ricardo Galarza, appeared disturbed and upset. He told CNN last week that he last saw his daughter two years ago when she visited for the summer. She was supposed to have returned for Christmas. The girl's maternal grandmother was barely able to speak and remain upright. Jorelys disappeared December 2 near a playground at a Canton, Georgia, apartment complex. Searchers found her body in a compactor-type trash bin there three days later. Authorities have accused 20-year-old Ryan Brunn -- a maintenance worker at the complex -- of killing her. Jorelys died of blunt force trauma to the head and was stabbed and sexually assaulted, according to authorities. A date for Brunn's arraignment has not been set. David Cannon Sr., one of Brunn's court-appointed attorneys, has said that his client will plead not guilty. On Sunday, Rivera told WAPA that if authorities have evidence showing Brunn killed her daughter, he should face the death penalty. ""The truth is I can't tell you if it was him or if it wasn't him, because I had never seen him before,"" she said.","Hundreds of mourners filled the funeral home in Puerto Rico .

"(CNN) -- Actress Kristin Davis is an ambassador for Oxfam, an international alliance of 15 organizations striving to find lasting solutions to poverty and injustice. The group works directly with communities in 98 countries. As part of her efforts, Davis advocates for vulnerable women around the world. She recently spoke with CNN's Sonya Hamasaki about the need to help people improve their lives. Below are excerpts from that interview. CNN: What inspired you to get involved with Oxfam? Kristin Davis: Oxfam is unique in helping people become independent. That's their goal. One of the reasons I got involved was that after the tsunami, I remember all of the fishermen whose entire lives had gotten washed away in Indonesia. I thought, ""How are they ever going to get their livelihoods back?"" Oxfam was committed to staying there until those fishermen got their own livelihoods back together so that they could be self-sufficient.. CNN: You are specifically interested in helping women receive job training and education. Why is that important to you? Davis: A lot of times, these women have been left alone or their husbands have died of AIDS or different things. I was interested in helping women who may live in a world where they weren't trained to do anything and they weren't afforded an education. Oxfam will go into these communities and try to help out. It might be raising chickens, it might be sewing beaded necklaces; they're helping the women empower themselves. And, especially for women, that's a huge, huge life-changing thing to be able to be self-sufficient. The women can then support their children, and usually the women send their children to school and it changes the next generation. CNN: What is your role as an ambassador? Davis: The way I perceive my role as an ambassador -- which I think is personal for everyone -- is that I travel to places that I'm interested in, where there's a story or a particular situation with women usually, and I just talk to people and I'm a witness to their story. I come back and try to tell their stories. Just going is such an inspiration for me that I would do it (if) no one asked me at all. But it's wonderful for me to be able to talk about it to other people, because I think sometimes we're not aware of how other people are living. CNN: What is a hero to you? Davis: I think right now our world is somewhat chaotic. There's a lot to be upset about and a lot to complain about, and the heroes are the people who are getting up and doing something about it. That's what I love about the CNN Heroes program: that it's people all over the world who may just be on their own trying to fix something. And I think that's great. It's great to be able to support people who are involved in maybe a small-scale way, trying to make the world better. I think there are so many people trying so hard to change things, and the news just doesn't get to cover them all. So it's nice that CNN Heroes does cover it.","""Sex and the City"" star Kristin Davis is an ambassador for Oxfam .

"(CNN) -- California's Silicon Valley has long dominated the internet industry. The world's largest dotcom companies operate from the valley, it attracts the industry's brightest minds and countless innovative ideas are generated out of the area. So, can Europe make headway in this ever-expanding industry? Ilja Laurs, founder of Getjar -- the world's largest app store -- says there are labor, cultural and bureaucratic factors that make it very difficult for Europe to compete with Silicon Valley. Laurs argues the talent pool across the continent for specialist services in Europe is too small. ""While there are certain pockets of good people for particular niches, you maybe only able to find a hundred people in those specific areas."" That compares to the thousands available in Silicon Valley, putting Europe at a competitive disadvantage. European startup enterprises face the same regulations that are applied to large corporations, Laurs says, putting an unfair burden on smaller companies. Laurs says governments need to decide whether encouraging high-tech communities is something they want to focus on. He believes changes must be made to labor laws and capital gains tax for small organizations to be viable. ""The same set of rules that governs big corporations can be very damaging to small startups which operate in a very different environment,"" he says. Cultural differences can also make it difficult for Europe to compete, Laurs says. He points to America's strong work ethic as an example, saying it gives Silicon Valley an edge. Facebook, for example, is not ""working nine to five,"" he says. In Europe, by comparison, some government regulations dictate six weeks of vacation time. He believes Europeans value other aspects of life, such as family, above work. ""Americans are proud if they work and spend a hundred hours a week in the office. I'm not saying that it's good or bad, it's just the way it is and that's very incompatible with innovation."" But ultimately, Laurs says, innovation is ""about trial and error.""","Getjar founder Ilja Laurs says there are factors which make it difficult for Europe to compete .

"(CNN) -- ""I'm very at home working with mythology, "" Tori Amos says. No kidding. Amos' newest album, ""Night of Hunters,"" is a fable about one woman's lost love and the emotional journey over the course of a night that helps her let go of a man and recapture her fire. Along the way, she meets a shape shifting fox named Anabelle who acts as her guide to help navigate her through the predatory forces that lie within and around us. While ""Night of Hunters"" uses Amos' familiar themes of spirit guides, magical elixirs, forces of nature and reclaiming female power, making this album was a new undertaking for her. Instead of the electronic sound and production that marked her last few releases, ""Night of Hunters"" is stripped and essential. Amos returned to the piano and used the classical music format of a song cycle, where there is a common theme to the collection of songs and they are intended to be performed in sequence, to present her supernatural tale. Twenty years after her groundbreaking solo debut, ""Little Earthquakes,"" Tori Amos talked to CNN about the irony of her getting kicked out of classical music school, women's sharp and deadly tongues and why she has no desire to be 30 again. CNN: ""Night of Hunters"" is such an elaborate concept album. How did this story unfold, not just musically, but in your own head? Amos: I was traveling about a year ago through Europe and the one thing that I began to hear from people is how much their lives could change in a day. Really what this is about is a woman's psychological experience and the shattering of a relationship. It's about her emotional breakthrough that happens from dusk 'til dawn. I've been working on a piece for the National Theater for, like, 5,000 years, but that's different because you have scenes with text. Song cycles work on a poetic level, not like a play or musical. I wanted there to be a poetic level to this (album), where the poems come to life, and the emotion, but the plotline isn't necessarily in the songs themselves. For a song cycle to work, you have to feel these things when you hear them and you either have an emotional reaction to it or you don't. The plotline is something that gets woven together in the backstory. But when (classical music label) Deutsche/Grammophon approached me and said, We heard you're working on this musical, what about if you did a 21st century song cycle based on classical themes? I said, ""What about if I (don't)?"" CNN: You obviously came around. Amos: Yeah, but I mean, Jesus Christ, it's a tall order! CNN: Weren't you kicked out of the Peabody Conservatory when you were 5 for being too radical and not adhering to their classical norms? Amos: Yeah, that's kinda funny. It's true. CNN: You hadn't thought about it before? Amos: I have, but it's true. I was kicked out because they didn't think I could embrace the classical path. The dean that is there now has reached out in the last few months to my dad and has said that the Peabody is a very, very different place of learning than it was in the '70s. It would need to be because they weren't anywhere near where Deutsche/Grammophon was and this is one of the greatest classical places of all time. CNN: The musical you talked about for the National Theater is 'The Light Princess,' based on the book by George MacDonald? Amos: It was, but we changed it because our story became very different. CNN: What happened? Are there any aspects that remain? Amos: She floats. That's about it. I didn't really like her in the book. I felt it was from a man's perspective and I had no idea about how she felt that she had this incredible ability, but was treated like she had a disability. It was very much through the eyes of the patriarchal male force and I never got a sense of her, her friends, her perspective and what her life would have been like. So it's a very different world, our world. The key things are about power and about growing up and realizing as you grow up that there are consequences for the choices you make, especially when you get seduced by power. CNN: You have a daughter, Natashya Hawley, who is a preteen. What do you say to her about nurturing herself and cultivating her interests and being aware of her own power? Amos: I think the big thing for her is the peer group, which inspired some of the musical and seeing how important the peer group is for that age. A comment from a friend, especially things about weight or appearance, how they look, can be so damaging that, as a mother sometimes, you have to think, OK, how am I going to say something that is going to neutralize what a friend said who seemed to want to wound? Sometimes they do want to wound each other because you know how it is with girls. I don't know how it happens, but they know how to flay somebody just by licking their lips. CNN: But there's also a great sense of community that girls and women have when there's not a sense of competition or jealousy. Amos: That's right. And yet all of us have sometimes begrudgingly looked at somebody else and said, Well, I'm happy things are going well for them but I've worked just as hard! We've all had that moment of, Yes I'm happy for her and wouldn't it be great if Lady Luck would smile on me because I've been an elf working at Santa's shop for years. CNN: The track 'Carry' stood out sonically because, even without knowing that it was the closing track on the album, you could really get a sense of a dawn breaking and a wholeness that had been restored. Amos: I hope women can take that away. As the sun sets, we've all had those nights where you question your choices and where your life is going. Sometimes it seems like we're closer to our manicurists than we are our own souls. We have to find ways to get in touch with that and to listen to it and to hear it. CNN: It has been 20 years since 'Little Earthquakes' was released. Do you have any different opinions or reflections on that album today? Amos: Twenty years ago, you don't really think about the self-worth challenges that you'll have becoming 50. I don't mean a successful person or intelligent person, I mean a desirable person. And I don't mean in a tight dress, I'm just talking about walking with each step and having a wonderment and wanting to be exactly where you are. Some people say, I'd give anything to be 30 again. Well, I really wouldn't. I didn't enjoy being 30. Making 'Little Earthquakes' was great, but I didn't have a calm and I didn't know how to laugh. I think becoming a mom is the greatest gift that ever happened to me. I say that's one of the key shifts in my life that has gotten me to this place today. But with each year, you always have to be listening, be listening to your own soul, be growing.","Her newest album, ""Night of Hunters,"" was released on September 20 .

"Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- NASA launched its Ares I-X rocket Wednesday, after multiple delays over two days because of bad weather. The 327-foot rocket -- which NASA considers the world's largest -- took off at 11:30 a.m. ET, 30 minutes before a noon deadline for the launch. It rose about 24 miles. About two minutes after liftoff, the first-stage, reusable rocket booster fell into the Atlantic, where it was to be picked up by a ship. It was the first flight test for the Constellation Program, NASA's next-generation spacecraft and launch vehicle system. The rocket's launch is part of NASA's mission to someday return astronauts to the moon and later travel to Mars. NASA spokesman George Diller, who was moderating the launch preparations for broadcasters, communicated the frustration as launches were repeatedly called off with just minutes to go. After 11 a.m., it appeared there would be a narrow window for a liftoff, and a half-hour later the rocket roared skyward. ""I can't tell you how proud I am of all of you,"" Ed Mango, Ares I-X launch director, told engineers and others inside the center after the launch. ""That was just one of the most beautiful rocket launches I've ever seen."" ""It shows what we can do when we have a common goal."" As the clock ticked toward noon, NASA officials nervously awaited all-clears for technical items and a weather clearance from weather officer Kathy Winters who, time and again, said conditions were ""red,"" meaning a no-go. A reconnaissance plane was giving her frequent weather reports. She kept looking for a break in the high-level clouds.  ""It's a very dynamic situation,"" Winters said. Before the launch, the space agency had begun negotiating with the Air Force to see if a Thursday launch attempt was possible. Failing that, NASA couldn't have tried again until November 16. NASA's primary concern was the high-level, cold clouds that can cause triboelectrification, or the production of a kind of static electricity, similar to what happens when you walk across a carpet, then touch something. If static surrounds the rocket, it can interfere with radio signals sent by or to the rocket. The Constellation Program has been developing new vehicles to replace space shuttles, which will be phased out in 2010. If the program moves forward, the Orion capsule atop the Ares rocket will not be ready to take astronauts into space until at least 2015, leaving a gap of at least five years in which the only way the United States would be able to put humans in orbit would be by hitching a ride with the Russians. Part of the test rocket mission is for scientists to try out three massive main parachutes, measuring 150 feet in diameter and weighing one ton each -- the largest rocket parachutes ever manufactured. The parachutes are a primary element of the rocket's deceleration system, NASA says. After the rocket is successfully launched, the parachutes are to open at the same time, ""providing the drag necessary to slow the descent of the huge solid rocket motor for a soft landing in the ocean,"" the agency says on its Web site. The two parts of the rocket are to separate at about 130,000 feet. The top of the rocket, known as the upper stage, includes a mock Orion crew capsule and a launch abort system. The upper stage will continue its ascent until gravity forces its return to Earth, after which it will fall into the Atlantic Ocean. The launch comes at a critical time, when NASA is waiting for President Obama to decide future funding for the agency. An independent committee reviewing the future of space flight recently reported that the U.S. space program appears to be pursuing goals that exceed current funding. The committee also recommended to the White House that funding for NASA's under-construction international space station should be extended until 2020. CNN's Kim Segal and John Zarrella contributed to this report.","NEW: ""One of the most beautiful rocket launches I've ever seen,"" says launch director .

"(CNN) -- The space shuttle Atlantis glided to a picture-perfect landing Friday morning under bright, sunny skies at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The seven-person crew returned after an 11-day mission to deliver key spare parts to prolong the life of the international space station. The original six-member crew, with flight engineer Nicole Stott -- who launched in August -- returned amid sunny, clear Florida weather. ""Couldn't have picked a clearer day,"" Cndr. Charles Hobaugh said as the shuttle approached the runway. Mission Control told Hobaugh that the landing was a ""picture-perfect end"" to the mission. ""Everybody, welcome back to Earth, especially you, Nicole,"" Mission Control said. Stott had spent 87 days on the international space station, according to NASA. About an hour after the shuttle landed, the crew transport vehicle moved alongside the orbiter access hatch on Atlantis' port side, NASA said on its Web site. With the crew hatch opened, the astronauts left the orbiter to enter the vehicle. It contains beds and comfortable seats so the astronauts can receive a brief medical checkup before they step onto the tarmac, NASA said. The crew's mission included three space walks and installation of two platforms to the station's backbone. The platforms will hold spare parts that will sustain station operations after the shuttles are discontinued. NASA said the parts the crew delivered will add years to the station's life after the space shuttle fleet is retired next year. Some of the parts are for systems that keep the station from overheating or tumbling through space, NASA said. During the mission, the crew celebrated Thanksgiving while they prepared for landing. They dined on smoked turkey, green beans, mushrooms, cornbread dressing and candied yams, according to NASA. Russia will take over supplying the international space station. On this mission, Atlantis also marked a 6 pound, 13 ounce development. Astronaut Randy Bresnik welcomed a daughter from space, the second time a baby has been born to a U.S. astronaut on a mission.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York City crackdown on suspects allegedly involved in forged credit cards and identity theft led authorities to a $13 million global crime ring, Queens County District Attorney Richard Brown said Friday. He called it the largest and perhaps most sophisticated ring of its kind in U.S. history. Authorities hired translators to eavesdrop on a series of conversations in Arabic, Russian and Mandarin that led police to 86 suspects in a series of raids that started Tuesday, Brown said. He said the defendants, who were charged with stealing the personal credit information of thousands of unwitting American and European consumers, are allegedly members of five organized crime rings with ties to Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Twenty-five others remain at large, Brown added. All of the 111 suspects were indicted in the theft case, while nearly two dozen of them were also charged in six indictments related to burglaries and robberies. Several suspects are believed to have engaged in ""nationwide shopping sprees, staying at five-star hotels, renting luxury automobiles and private jets, and purchasing tens of thousands of dollars worth of high-end electronics and expensive handbags and jewelry with forged credit cards,"" the Queens County District Attorney's Office reported. The two-year probe, dubbed Operation Swiper, involved physical surveillance, intelligence gathering and court-authorized electronic eavesdropping on dozens of telephones in which thousands of conversations were intercepted, it said.","The ring is the largest of its kind ever discovered in the United States, the DA says .

You can convert foreign currencies into convertibles at hotels and money-changing booths, but if you're converting U.S. dollars you will be charged a 10 per cent commission. The sensible thing would be to get your money from an ATM, however, while Visa cards are accepted at some ATMs, other cards are practically useless in Havana. Credit cards are becoming more widely accepted in Havana, but using them will incur a hefty surcharge and American credit and debit cards can't be used at all in Cuba. That ban applies even to credit cards issued by American-owned companies and companies with apparently scant connection to the U.S. The upshot is that you should check with your credit card company before traveling, or you may find you're carrying a lot of worthless plastic. See Carlos Acosta's Havana Â» . Getting around The faded glories of Old Havana are best appreciated on foot, but to fully explore the city, and after nightfall in some of the sketchier areas, you're better off taking a taxi. The cheapest are the state-owned yellow and black Ladas, although these are not meant to pick up tourists within 100 meters of a hotel. Haggle over the price before you set off. You can flag down metered tourist taxis along the Malecon and they also congregate outside the Hotel Nacional in Vedado. It's technically illegal, but easy enough, to flag down pretty much any passing car and pay for a ride around the city, although there's no guarantee of the car, or the driver, being roadworthy. If your heart's set on ride in a 50s classic car a better bet is to take a Gran Car. These state-owned vintage cars are in good condition, although they're pricey for Havana. Cocotaxis are kitschy, bright yellow, three-wheeled novelty taxis that look a bit like a crash helmet on wheels. They're cheap and fun, if you like that kind of thing. Also with three wheels, the pedal-powered bici-taxis are usually cheaper, and often more comfortable, than their four-wheeled motorized cousins. If you're lucky you'll get one with a salsa-blasting stereo strapped onto the back. Do you have any Havana tips? Let us know . Havana's crowded buses are a pickpocket's paradise and are best avoided. A rum time Cubans do enjoy a splash of rum and their capital is home to one of the world's most famous brands -- Havana Club. There's no better way to cool down on a steamy Havana night than with a rum cocktail -- but which to choose? Here are a few you should sample: . Cuba Libre: A Havana classic made with cola, rum and lime. Canchanchara: The locals' favorite -- white rum, lime juice and honey. El Presidente: This mixture of rum, red vermouth, Curacao and grenadine is named not after Fidel, but after President Mario Garcia Menocal. Daiquiri: The purist's daiquiri is a combination of rum, lime juice, sugar and maraschino, but if you're feeling impure you can have yours with added fruit. Mojito: Ernest Hemingway's tipple of choice was this mix of white rum, lime juice, sugar or sugar cane juice, soda water and fresh mint. Havana Special: A refreshing blend of white rum, maraschino and pineapple juice. Saoco: Not unlike a turbo-charged milkshake, the saoco is a double whammy of white rum and coconut milk. If all those cocktails haven't quenched your thirst for knowledge, you can carry out more rum research at the Museo del Ron, 262 Avenida del Puerto, on the corner of San Pedro and Sol. Red tape Unless you're from the U.S., all you need to visit Havana is a tourist card and a plane ticket, and the two are best acquired at the same time. The card will let you stay in the country for 30 days and if you don't get one when you book your trip you can pick one up from your local Cuban consulate -- although that can be a time-consuming process. If you're a U.S. citizen planning to visit Havana, good luck! Before leaving you'll need to get a license from the U.S. government, and regular tourists aren't eligible. Of course, there are U.S. citizens who travel to Cuba on a tourist card bought in Canada or Mexico, but it's a ruse that can result in a hefty fine and even a jail term. For the latest information see the U.S. Department of State Website.","Cuba has two currencies, but tourists will mainly stick with convertible pesos .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- After suffering the miscarriage of their 20th child, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar will hold a memorial service on Wednesday, December 14, for the baby girl they have named Jubilee Shalom Duggar. The reality TV stars of TLC's ""19 Kids and Counting"" had discovered on Thursday at a routine ultrasound appointment that their 20th child, due next April, no longer had a heartbeat. Advised by her doctor to let the miscarriage occur naturally, Michelle, 45, was being cared for at home by her family. Following the miscarriage late Sunday night, Michelle began to feel lightheaded and as a precaution was taken to the hospital, where she was kept for observation, according to a family spokesperson. Michelle is recovering well and expected to return home later on Monday, the spokesperson adds. RELATED: Michelle Duggar Resting at Home, Plans to Name Child .

"(CNN) -- India's Shiv Kapur holds the clubhouse lead at the weather-affected Dutch Open at Hilversum, although over half the field have still to complete their second rounds. Kapur finished his first round of Friday, after vandalism to some greens, and heavy rain, forced widespread disruption on Thursday. And he followed his opening four-under-par 66 with a steady 67 to lie one stroke ahead of Briton Gary Orr (66) and South African James Kingston (68). ""I've been driving the ball really well, and on this course there is a big premium on hitting a lot of fairways,"" 28-year-old Kapur told the official European Tour website. ""The driver has been behaving and I gave myself quite a few chances. Overall I just played quite solid,"" added Kapur -- who is still seeking his maiden victory on Tour. Meanwhile, Sweden's Oscar Floren and U.S. Open champion Rory McIlory lie just two shots behind, with Mcilory having to play 27 holes on Friday. The Northern Irishman began with a level-par 70, but carded six birdies in his second round for a five-under-par 36-hole total of 135. ""I don't feel I drove the ball particularly well. There were a couple of loose shots but I got some lucky breaks,"" he told reporters. Of those players still out on the course, Briton Stephen Dodd and joint overnight leader Marcel Siem of Germany head the field on eight-under-par.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- They are domestic relics of a bygone era when space travel was new and exciting and the world was buzzing with optimism about what could be. This Coney Island playground climbing frame is one of the larger items clogging the Kleeman family's barn. NASA's Apollo 11 moon landing 40 years ago reinvigorated demand for space-inspired mementoes that was stirring well before the start of the Space Age in the 1950s. Shops offered everything from rocket-shaped lamps, to skateboards, biscuit tins and toys emblazoned with stars and futuristic astronauts. Such was the excitement surrounding the momentous moon landing in 1969 that some were moved to create their own memorabilia in needlepoint and tin.  See memorabilia of 1969 moon landing Â» . Many early examples of space-inspired design, both professional and homemade, can now be found in a 100ft hay barn at the Kleeman family home in the U.S. state of Connecticut. They're not on display -- yet -- but the family hopes to soon show the world what they call the ""Space Age Museum,"" a collection of as many as 10,000 pieces inspired by humanity's adventures in space. ""Everything started with a toy ray gun Peter and I bought at a flea market in Brimfield, Massachusetts 20 years ago for $10,"" John Kleeman said. ""We have never lost the excitement of that first find and since then we have continued our quest for cultural artifacts which tell the back story of the Space Age -- how ordinary folk like us experienced the magic, adventure and meaning of human space exploration."" Weekend trips to markets and auctions became more frequent and over time the collection grew to include more cumbersome items including a 40-foot promotional trailer based on the design of ""Terra IV,"" a battle cruiser in the 1950s U.S. television series, ""Space Patrol."" ""They had a movie theatre inside so 40 people could sit inside it and watch a rocket launch,"" John's son Peter explained. ""We had to adjust the doors to the barn to fit it, but it's in our barn now."" As the barn became more crowded, references to their ""collection"" morphed into ""the museum"" and their father-son hobby transformed into a potential business. ""It was kind of a 'some day' kind of thing,"" Peter said. ""My dad had a day job as an attorney and I was in college and we said some day we'll create a museum so people can visit."" ""Then three or four years ago I was at a point where I'd been working in the outdoors leading trips for youth at risk and thinking, ""Do I want to do this forever? How am I going to fit this space museum into the picture some day?' I realized that I'd like to do it now."" Since then, they've been carefully peeling back layers of packaging and photographing their second-hand treasures for a digital catalogue. ""My mum is surprisingly and wonderfully supportive of all this,"" Peter said. ""Because it's a family business she always gets consulted, especially on large acquisitions. I think there have been some vetoes but there's nothing that she's vetoed that we wish that we'd gotten."" Now 29, Peter Kleeman travels back and forth from his parents' house and his new home in New York to build the business. ""For now we'd like to contract out our exhibits to other museums and then if funding and the right sponsorship came in we'd be open to doing a permanent location so people could visit,"" he said. For Peter, the Space Age Museum is not simply about nostalgia; it's an important reminder of the enthusiasm that once gripped the world about future frontiers that has slowly deflated with time. ""One of the questions I ask myself is, 'what would it take to turn that around and for us to have a more creative and adventurous optimism for the future, and get that pioneering spirit back in our culture?'"" A mission to Mars might be one, he suggested, along with a long-term plan for future exploration. This museum curator is not in the camp that argues that money for space programs is better spent at home. ""A lot of people feel that because of our environment and different social and economic struggles that are going on in the planet that we should just focus all of our resources on fixing things here,"" he said. ""I agree -- there's a lot that's not working on our planet. We should be taking care of each other but that shouldn't stop us from also exploring -- there's a got to be a way to balance it. ""I think that knowing our place in the solar system and beyond helps give us perspective on who we are and where we are. I think it can be humbling and it also helps us remember how precious and rare our planet is and that we really need to protect it and manage its resources better.""","For more than 20 years the Kleeman family has collected space-inspired items .

"(CNN) -- No play can begin in a baseball game until the pitcher throws the ball. And no play can conclude until the umpire makes the call. ""We're not just robots they send out there,"" umpire Tim McClelland (2nd from L) told author Bruce Weber. Yet these figures -- the man on the mound and the men who stand in judgment -- are vastly different in importance to the average fan. There are countless children who dream of becoming a major-league pitcher. He is, literally, the king of the hill. Umpires? Almost nobody dreams of becoming an umpire. And yet the positions share a number of similarities, according to two new books: ""As They See 'Em"" (Scribner), by New York Times writer Bruce Weber, and ""The Complete Game"" (Knopf), by former major-league pitcher (and current New York Mets broadcaster) Ron Darling. Both jobs require a great deal of command, neither gets enough training, and both are often disrespected by others in the game. Indeed, despite a library of books by and about pitchers (Jim Bouton's ""Ball Four,"" Jim Brosnan's ""The Long Season,"" Christy Mathewson's ""Pitching in a Pinch""), Darling said he believes that people still don't understand what it takes to stand on that mound. ""Within baseball circles there is a common baseball axiom, 'If pitchers weren't so stupid, hitters would never get a hit,' "" he said in an e-mail. ""Of course, I knew this was a fallacy so I decided to write about the travails of major league pitchers. Throwing a ball 95 mph to tin cup-sized quadrants sounds pretty difficult to me, and I wanted to express this to the reader."" Umpires, on the other hand, rarely get written about at all -- in fact, they're often treated as less than human. (""The owners basically see them like bases,"" former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent told Weber. ""They say, 'We need a base; we need an umpire; same thing.' "") Weber found a fraternity (and they are almost all men) much like cops or soldiers: tight-lipped believers in baseball law and order. Weber immersed himself in the ""land of umpires,"" as the book's subtitle calls it, attending umpiring school, calling games at various levels of pro ball and talking with those who were willing -- including the legendary Doug Harvey, who was called ""God"" for his imperious demeanor. What he found is that what looks so obvious on television at home is often a challenge on the field, a matter not just of eyesight but positioning, rule-book knowledge and basic guts. ""That's really what [being an umpire] is about -- is being in charge,"" he said. ""If there's anything that characterizes the major league umpire, it's that special kind of chutzpah."" Umpires need that presence because they're often baseball's most disrespected men. Aside from the vitriol they face -- the managers kicking dirt, the spectators yelling ""Kill the ump"" -- they're second-guessed by broadcasters and barely tolerated by management, as Weber reveals in detailing the episodes preceding and following the 1999 umpires' strike. And yet Major League Baseball doesn't participate in umpire training or development, entrusting it to two umpire-run private schools, Weber observes. (MLB does run an annual umpire camp.) Darling echoes Weber's concerns in his own field, pitching. In these days of strict pitch counts and injury concern, pitchers are ""undertrain[ed],"" he says, noting that top draft choices climb the ranks ""never allowed to throw more than 110 pitches."" That leaves them at a disadvantage when they have to go deeper into a game or cope with a tough inning, he says. ""It would be like training for the marathon and never running more than 5 miles,"" he says. ""Identifying and preserving million-dollar arms are [the purview] of doctors, not baseball people."" Darling's book is a chronicle of pitchers' thought processes, using individual innings from his pitching or broadcasting career to make his point. He talks about panic overtaking a pitcher, as it did for Darling in a 1984 game in which he got pasted by the Cubs; he also addresses the rush of pitching in a World Series game and -- in a treat for baseball fans -- goes over the extra innings in perhaps the most famous college baseball game ever, a 1981 extra-inning contest that Darling's Yale Bulldogs lost to Frank Viola's St. John's Redmen, 1-0. He says he remembered the games vividly. ""I definitely watched tapes and read box scores, but I was very clear on almost all the minutiae of the good old days. A little scary and maybe a major personality flaw!"" Pitchers get more support than umpires, of course. Darling observes that the relationship between a pitcher and his catcher during a well-pitched game ""is one of sport's most beautiful dances. I would not have said it when I was playing, but after a shutout ... there is a love for that person immediately after the process. You did something together that could not have been done alone, and nobody can understand what you went through to get there."" Umpires, too, take pride in their best moments, though few pay attention outside their fellow umpires. More common is to be vilified for missed calls. Weber devotes a moving passage in his book to a conversation with the retired Don Denkinger, a 29-year veteran remembered by fans (if he's remembered at all) for a wrong call in the 1985 World Series. Though time has dulled the pain, ""I think he lives with [that call] every day,"" Weber said. ""When a dreadful thing happens to you in front of so many people and you become famous for it, it must be devastating."" Weber says his time with umpires has made him much more sympathetic to their judgmental tasks. When watching games now, the Yankees fan says, he'll focus on the umpires. ""I just think umpiring is interesting. People hate 'em, and they somehow perceive of umpiring as a flaw in the game, but I don't,"" he said. ""Now I'm always interested who the umpires are."" Which is a point the umpires would appreciate. ""Umpires are people, too,"" veteran ump Tim McClelland told Weber. ""We have families; we have emotions. ... Somebody says, 'Kill the umpire,' and people go, 'Heh, heh, that's funny,' but in order to do that, you have to disassociate the umpire from the person. ""We're human. We're not just robots they send out there.""","""As They See 'Em"" is in-depth look at baseball umpires .

"(CNN) -- Ted Turner appeared Tuesday on CNN, the network he founded, to talk about last week's election results, his business ventures, and his relationship with ex-wife Jane Fonda. CNN founder Ted Turner tells the network he's ""encouraged"" by the results of last week's election. Turner is promoting a new autobiography, ""Call Me Ted"" (Warner Books), which documents his life, loves, successes and failures. Probably best known for his 1980 launch of CNN, the first 24-hour all-news cable network, Turner has also made news as a philanthropist and supporter of the United Nations. He won the America's Cup of yachting in 1977, and owned the Atlanta Braves when they won the World Series in 1995. Turner discussed the book on CNN's ""American Morning."" The following is an edited transcript. CNN: Let me ask you first of all, before we get involved in the actual book and the story of your life: What do you make of the results of this presidential election? Ted Turner: Well, I'm encouraged. I think we needed change that we can believe in.  Watch Turner talk about his relationship with ex-wife Jane Fonda Â» . CNN: Is [President-elect Barack Obama] the guy to pull this economy? Turner: Well, I don't know. I mean, our country in my lifetime has never been in this shape before. So we'll have to see. I think we are really heading into uncharted territory. But I think the main problem is, I hope he doesn't get blamed if things get tough -- because I think they are going to. CNN: [Obama] seems to be talking about a lot more government involvement in the business community going forward, more government money for an auto industry bailout, another economic stimulus package. As a person who pulled [himself] up in the business community from his bootstraps, is that the way to do it, with more government involvement? Turner: Well, I don't think so. It was a struggle financing CNN, but I did it without ever asking the government for a nickel. In fact, I gave the government $32 million when they were a little short and couldn't pay the dues to the U.N. CNN: A lot of people in this economic community losing an awful lot of money, something you know something about. Turner: I've lost a lot, too. We all have. CNN: You lost $7 billion when the dot-com bubble burst after the Time Warner-AOL merger. How did you not see the dot-com bubble bursting? How did you not see that that was all built on air? Turner: Maybe I did, but I was on a board of directors and a founder, and I was concerned about the AOL merger, but we didn't know that the books were cooked. We didn't do enough due diligence. CNN: Was that the worst business decision of your life? Turner: Oh yeah. Absolutely. CNN: If you could go back and do it again, would you have just completely called the whole thing off? Turner: Well, I couldn't have. At the time, there was so much momentum to do the deal, everybody was for it -- all of Wall Street and the management of both companies. And I wouldn't -- we could have stopped it if we had known of the accounting irregularities. But we didn't know. So there was no way to stop it. CNN: At about the same time, you were hemorrhaging money at the rate of about $10 million a day over the course of more than two years, your marriage to Jane Fonda broke up. And many people close to you were concerned -- because your father, who passed off his billboard business to you, committed suicide -- that you may follow him down that road. Turner: I wouldn't do that to my children and grandchildren. CNN: But they were concerned about it. Turner: Well, they might have been concerned about it, but there was no reason to be. CNN: You went through counseling, though, to try to come back. What was that road like? Turner: What, counseling? I've been in all kinds of counseling. I believe in doctors. Where I really spent the time was in couples and marriage counseling. It helped some. I was married for 10 years one time and 18 another. CNN: ... Jane Fonda has said, and said in the ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired over the weekend, that she still loves you. Is there-- . Turner: She didn't say that. CNN: Well, she says that she would be at your side in a blue minute. Turner: If I needed her. CNN: I would assume that somebody wouldn't do that unless they love you. Turner: It was nice of her to do. CNN: Any chance for a reconciliation? Turner: I don't think so, but you never know. CNN: What would it take? Turner: I don't know. More than a television interview. CNN: Have you thought about picking up the phone? Turner: No. I talk to her all the time. ... CNN: She said that -- this is a quote from the interview -- she said, ""It's impossible to really be with Ted the way he needs someone to be with him and have any kind of life of your own."" Are you tough to live with? Turner: I travel a lot. I'm on the move. CNN: You don't like to be alone? Turner: No. CNN: Why are you on the move so much? Turner: I don't know. I just got in the habit of it because that's how you get a lot done. Going from here to Philadelphia, and from Philadelphia to Atlanta, and Atlanta to Chicago, and Chicago to Los Angeles. When you are promoting a book, you really move. CNN: I know you've got to move around a lot. But some people have observed that when you are chased by demons, you have to move around a lot to stay out in front of them. Turner: Well, I'm not chased by demons. I feel pretty good. CNN: Why would people say that? Turner: I don't know. That I'm chased by demons? I don't know. They don't know. The only person who knows about demons is me. CNN: It's been a while since you have been involved with CNN. When you look -- . Turner: No, I'm involved every day, because I watch it just about every day. CNN: Involved in terms of the business aspect. Turner: That's OK, but viewers have got a lot of rights, too. ... [If] you don't have viewers, you don't have a business. CNN: ... When you come here and see how it's grown up, you see the international aspect of it, you see that on Election Night, CNN -- Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper, Campbell Brown, John King -- . Turner: They did a good job. CNN: They beat the networks. What do you think what you see that? Turner: I think it's great. CNN: This is the little entity that you started out of nothing. Turner: It's not so little. And it wasn't when we merged with Time Warner, either. Was the world's most important network. CNN: So what's next for you, if anything, at 70 years old? Turner: Well, I'm still promoting the book. It just came out two days ago. So that's a lot of work. CNN: ... [The book describes your] getting stuck on a sandbar, getting caught in a storm, almost dying off the coast of Cape Hatteras. ... How did you go from being a sailor that got stuck on the reef and almost died to somebody who managed to win the America's Cup on the Courageous?. Turner: Well, the same way in baseball, [the Atlanta Braves] set a record for consecutive last-place finishes in divisional play in baseball. First four years, we finished last, four years in a row. But I stuck with it and after 18 years, we won the World Series. And that's what I did with sailing. CNN: Just stick to it? Turner: Yeah. [I] stuck to it.

"(CNN) -- Oh, Rebecca Black. You gave us a reason to reconsider our favorite day of the workweek. And, apparently, the Internet couldn't get enough. Black, the teen songstress who became a YouTube sensation with the bubblegum ear worm ""Friday,"" topped the Google Zeitgeist list of hot search terms in 2011. Released in March, the largely reviled tune caused searches for the then-13-year-old's name to increase more than 10,000% over the past year, Google reported Wednesday. This year was the 11th for Zeitgeist, Google's look at search trends for the year. The report, rendered with interactive images and detailed infographics, breaks down searches by country and region as well as tallying global activity. ""From local celebrities in Finland to Singaporeans looking for news on the revolutions in Egypt and Libya half a world away, people turned to Google to learn more about what was happening on the world stage,"" Google's Amit Singhal wrote on the company's official blog. The top 10 wasn't all breezy pop songs. ""Jackass"" star Ryan Dunn, who died in a car crash in June, was the third-hottest search, while Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who died in October, was ninth. Jobs was already an internationally known name. But searches for him still rose 982% over 2010, Google said, with traffic peaking the week after his death. It was a big year for technology overall, and Google's results show it. The company's own Google+ social network was second on the list. (If that seems all too convenient, note that Zeitgeist rankings consider how fast a search term rises. So something that didn't exist last year, like Google+ or Rebecca Black's career, is inevitably going to have an advantage.) Massive video game release ""Battlefield 3"" was fifth on the list, and the iPad 2 was 10th. Squeezed between those two offerings, at No. 6, was a tech world product that doesn't even exist: the iPhone 5. Google says searches for that term peaked the week of September 25, days before Apple lovers learned that the new phone they were getting was, in fact, called the iPhone 4S. Singer Adele, Japan's damaged Fukushima power plant and acquitted murder suspect Casey Anthony rounded out the top 10. Of course, where there are top risers, there are fastest fallers. As Google+ emerged (albeit to what appears to be waning interest), former social networking hot spot Myspace slid, becoming the fastest-dropping search term. Delta Air Lines, Chinese Web services company Baidu (a Google rival during the company's now-terminated efforts there) and the Spanish-language search ""Hotmail correo"" also saw big dips, compared with their 2010 search rankings.","Rebecca Black, Steve Jobs among hottest 2011 searches on Google .

That is, there are some comics that should be really good movies, but because of a bad script, director or actors (sometimes all of the above) they end up cinematic duds like ""Ghost Rider."" And there are some comics that make the transition to the big screen really well with the help of great writers, directors and actors, like ""Batman Begins."" Movie producers are bringing a fairly serious comic book character, DC Comics' ""Jonah Hex,"" (played by Josh Brolin) to the big screen on Friday. The trailer from Warner Brothers (whose parent company, Time Warner, also owns CNN) looks like it's anything but. Early reviews aren't kind. By mid-Friday morning, the film had earned a rotten 11-percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. If you're not already familiar with the character, here's the gist: As a boy, Jonah Hex's drunk and abusive father sells him to an Apache tribe. Hex lives with the Apaches as a slave but wins the favor of the chief and becomes a free member. He gets separated from the tribe as an adult, ends up fighting for the Confederates in the Civil War -- even accidentally shooting Stonewall Jackson -- and ultimately wanders out West. But when he comes back to the tribe, a fight with a rival leads to his banishment and a new life as a bounty hunter. See Techland's brief history of Jonah Hex. The original run of the comic spanned the 1970s and 1980s, but the title was revived in the early 1990s and more recently in 2006. In later issues of the first run, Hex would be pulled through time, meeting up with Batman and a handful of other DC superheroes. ""Jonah Hex"" falls prey to a common problem with comics-turned-movies: The stories span years, sometimes decades. Most fans are only familiar with a comic book's story from the point when they start reading. But even so, fans of Jonah Hex know him as the star of a Western comic, not a superhero comic. Hollywood producers, however, know DC Comics as a powerhouse of superheroes, and they seem to have different expectations of ""Jonah Hex."" Based on the trailer, Hex now has mystical and magical abilities to raise and speak with the dead. His place in the Civil War is downplayed. There are no major characters who are Native American. Megan Fox stars as a gun toting prostitute, a never-before-seen friend of our hero. And ""Q"" from the James Bond franchise apparently had forerunners in frontier towns who provide Hex with horse-mounted Gatling guns and hand-held, dynamite-firing crossbows. Hex's story should make a good movie. ""Jonah Hex"" should be one of those comic-based movies that doesn't need many changes to work. But instead of trying to stay true to the comic, it appears that producers are hoping to attract a casual movie-going audience by sacrificing the original flavor of the character and story. The result appears to be a campy movie that alienates both fans and regular moviegoers. Looks like we're in ""Ghost Rider"" territory.","The storyline for ""Jonah Hex"" comic books spans decades .

"Washington (CNN) -- An engine problem forced passengers -- including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- to evacuate a United Airlines flight at Dulles International Airport on Wednesday, officials said. Flight attendants shouted ""everyone get out"" after passengers spotted smoke coming from the plane's right engine and notified the crew, according to one passenger who was onboard. Passengers slid down the plane's emergency slides onto the airport's tarmac, officials said. ""I am shaking ... People were screaming,"" passenger Jodi Gersh wrote in a Twitter post after evacuating. ""Attendants opened (the) rear door to see where smoke was coming from,"" she wrote in another post. ""They then very loudly started yelling 'everyone get out.' Very scary."" Ginsburg was on the flight and was not injured, a Supreme Court spokeswoman said. Passengers evacuated from the Boeing 757 onto the tarmac just after the aircraft left the gate, said Rob Yingling, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. There were 179 passengers and six crew members onboard, United spokesman Mike Trevino said. Yingling said an engine problem caused the evacuation. The Federal Aviation Administration said there was a report of a fire onboard. Trevino said the airline was investigating the incident, but did not confirm whether there had been an engine problem or a fire. Video from CNN affiliate WUSA showed firefighters at the scene. Flight 586 was scheduled to fly to San Francisco, Trevino said. Passengers will head to San Francisco on a different plane scheduled to leave Dulles later Wednesday, he said. Dulles is located in Chantilly, Virginia, about 25 miles from downtown Washington. CNN's Lindy Royce-Bartlett, Bill Mears and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I am shaking ...

"New York (CNN) -- Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, appeared at a book convention in New York City on Wednesday, undeterred by a scandal that she allegedly offered to sell access to her former husband, Britain's Prince Andrew. ""It was quite difficult for me to get to Javits Center this morning,"" she said. ""One or two people in the way, but then, perhaps you've read that,"" Ferguson said, joking about photographers following her every move. Ferguson, who is a best-selling children's book author,spoke at a breakfast at the Book Expo America conference, an annual convention of booksellers. She avoided CNN questions about the scandal. She is promoting her new series of books, ""Helping Hand Books."" The publisher describes them as stories aimed at children going through growing pains. On Sunday, the News of the World tabloid posted a video on its website that appears to show Ferguson accepting money from an undercover reporter in exchange for access to Prince Andrew. Ferguson is also filmed on hidden camera telling the reporter -- who was posing as a wealthy businessman -- that a payment of 500,000 pounds ($723,000) ""opens doors"" to Andrew. She then shakes hands with the reporter after he accepts the deal. In a statement issued Sunday, Ferguson apologized for the incident. ""I very deeply regret the situation and the embarrassment caused,"" the statement said. ""It is true that my financial situation is under stress, however, that is no excuse for a serious lapse in judgment and I am very sorry that this has happened."" The tabloid said its reporter and Ferguson met on two occasions, once in New York and another time in London. In the heavily edited, roughly 4-minute video, Ferguson appears to accept $40,000 as a down payment for a meeting with Andrew, then later discusses a wire transfer of the larger sum. ""If we want to do a big deal with Andrew, then that's the big one,"" she says. When asked how she would receive the 500,000 pounds, she tells the reporter, ""You send it to the bank account that I tell you to send it to."" In her statement Sunday, Ferguson confirmed Andrew ""was not aware or involved in any of the discussions that occurred. ... The Duke has made a significant contribution to his business role over the last 10 years and has always acted with complete integrity.""

"(Rolling Stone) -- Saturday night, Buffalo Springfield will wrap up their seven-date reunion tour with a headlining slot at Bonnaroo. According to the group's singer and guitarist Richie Furay, fans who missed out on seeing them this time around will have plenty of chances later in the year. ""The plan is to do 30 dates this fall,"" he tells Rolling Stone. ""The anchors will be Los Angeles and New York. What the other cities are, I can't tell you right now -- but we're almost certainly doing Red Rocks."" The plan is to play mostly large theaters, as opposed to arenas and amphitheaters. ""We want to keep it a little more intimate,"" he says. ""Rather than going out and playing a huge something . . . There have been people from Florida, Chicago and Texas saying to me, 'Hey, you gonna come my way?' I have to say that with 30 shows, we're gonna hit those cities."" Choose Rolling Stone's Cover: The Sheepdogs vs. Lelia Broussard. Vote Now . Furay became a born-again Christian in the mid-1970s, and since 1983 he's worked as a pastor at Calvary Chapel Church in Broomfield, Colorado. ""The church has been very supportive of this tour,"" he says. ""I have an assistant pastor that's doing some of the Sundays and we have a guest speaker come in too. Everybody's taken care of."" Hours before taking the stage with Buffalo Springfield at the Santa Barbara Bowl tonight, Furay called into Rolling Stone to chat about the tour. Let's start at the beginning. Where were you and what you were doing when Neil Young first contacted you last year about a Buffalo Springfield reunion? I think I was probably just in my home studio office, probably working on some church stuff. This thing was not on my radar. I got one of those calls that Neil was calling me, so I got on the phone and we just started the conversation. He said that he'd been talking to Stephen [Stills] and they thought it would be really fun to do the Bridge School Benefit. They wanted to know if I was into it. It's kind of funny, 'cause Neil said, 'Well, you know, we don't have to do it this year if this is too soon. We can do it next year or the next year..."" And I'm thinking, ""Neil, I mean we're not 20 years old again. We better do this while we still can!"" I think a day later we all got on the phone -- Stephen, Neil and myself. We all agreed to do it. I was on my way to Israel in a couple of weeks, so right after I came back I had four days and then I went out to Northern California. We just kind of started rehearsing and it led to this. Buffalo Springfield Launch First Tour In 43 Years . How long after the two Bridge School shows did you start talking about doing more shows this year? Between Thanksgiving and Christmas of last year it was decided. I don't know how it all got done. The three of us and our managers just kind of agreed to go ahead and take it to the next step. I imagine that Bonnaroo was the anchor for these six California shows this month. Absolutely. They all build up to it. It started in Oakland, which is a little obscure and out of the way. Then we went to Los Angeles and there was a little more tension and publicly visible. Now here we are at a smaller outdoor venue. It's given us a feel building up to being outdoors at Bonnaroo. Photos: Buffalo Springfield Kick Off Their Reunion Tour . How many days did you guys rehearse? A solid week. It was to our advantage that we had played in October, so we had at least an hour's worth of music that we'd already started to rehearse. And then we just moved on from there. One of the neat things about what we're doing is that we're doing it ourselves. We don't have 10 musicians and singers. We got five guys and what you hear is what you get. I think that is something really unique for what we're doing right now. Are you singing songs you haven't sung since in over 40 years? Oh, yeah! With the Richie Furay Band I do a medley of songs that I sang on the first Buffalo Springfield album. I do a medley of ""Flying On the Ground Is Wrong,"" ""Do I Have To Come Right Out and Say It and Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing."" I also play a version of ""Go and Say Goodbye"" because I just love that song. So with those four songs I was already familiar, but everything else was pretty much songs we haven't played for 40 years. What do you feel when you're walking onstage with Neil and Stephen? This is something nobody thought would ever happen again. It's awe. That's what everybody is feeling. I saw a guy this morning that said he was coming to the show tonight. He said, ""I had tickets 43 years ago in Nashville to see you guys with the Beach Boys."" It was within a day or two of when Martin Luther King had been shot and we'd cancelled the show. He said, ""So I've been waiting 43 years to see this band play."" I'm so used to seeing Neil as the frontman. It's cool to see him sing harmonies or just play the piano. He usually isn't a utility player like that. Neil made it clear at the first show -- and certainly this was our understanding going in -- that this was not Neil Young and Buffalo Springfield or Stephen Stills and Buffalo Springfield. This is Buffalo Springfield. That's the approach we're taking. It's a band and everybody fills their role. [Drummer] Joe [Vitale] and [bassist] Rick [Rosas] fill their roles too. We just share the music and the lead singing. It's a true band. There's no agendas. That's what's really neat. I think we're way past that. I mean, we were 20-year-old kids when we started. We're doing this because we want to do it and it's fun and it's unique and because we know there's a lot of people out there that, like me, that never thought it would ever happen! This has to be the most time the three of you have spent together since 1968. It is. How are you guys getting along? Is it weird after all this time? No, there's nothing weird about it. From the moment I saw Neil at the rehearsal hall before the Bridge School we just started talking. There was nothing we had to work through or work out to get our relationship back together. None at all. Then when Stephen arrived it was the same thing. This has been a truly dynamic situation. Everybody is just feeling the same. We left the show last night and Stephen just had the biggest smile on his face. That's just the way it is. I think this is the fun we thought we were going to have back in the Sixties. Because of circumstances, it just didn't happen. But we're having fun now. There's energy in Neil. There's energy in Stephen. There's energy in me. I feel young up there, man. Are you at all nervous about playing Bonnaroo in front of something like 80,000 people? I'm not. You know, sometimes it's more difficult to play in front of 80 people than it is 80,000. It's just the way it is. With the nerves of intimacy it can be much more intimidating than playing in front of a sea of people. A lot of the reviewers have commented on how remarkably preserved your voice is. Do you attribute that to good genes or clean living or just luck? I think that's the grace of God. No doubt about it. But I think I'm singing better than I did in 1967. There's more of a confidence there now. Are you guys thinking about taping the shows for a live album or DVD? Well, there's been no direct conversation that I've had, but I know the shows are being recorded. Each one. Do you think the setlist is going to change at all? I know fans want to hear ""Expecting To Fly,"" ""Flying On the Ground Is Wrong"" and a few others. It's certainly not going to change before Bonnaroo, but I would say that by the time we go out in the fall we will probably work in five or six more songs. We'll probably work in ""Flying on the Ground is Wrong,"" ""Hung Upside Down"" and ""Down to the Wire."" We were just going over the chord patterns to that one yesterday. I'm sure it's hard to say at this point, but do you think that Buffalo Springfield is going to carry on in some form after this tour? Well, I don't think you're gonna be able to say that Buffalo Springfield is an entity that you can count on continuing. I mean, there might be some special things that we do -- but right now it's just one day at a time. We all have different careers, and this is what we're doing right now . . . What's most heartwarming to me is the friendships. I mean, it's just too much, man. Copyright Â© 2011 Rolling Stone.","Furay says fans will have plenty of chances see them perform later in the year .

"(CNN) -- ""Sesame Street"" may not be a real place, but tell that to some of the people Michael Davis met when researching and talking about his new book, ""Street Gang."" Bert, left, and Ernie have been mainstays of ""Sesame Street"" since the beginning. ""I met a lot of people who I worked with in New York or got to know in New York -- transplants -- who said to me, 'When I first arrived here in New York, I had this strange desire to find Sesame Street,' "" he said. Well, to paraphrase the famous theme song, who wouldn't want to get to ""Sesame Street""? For two generations, the fictional block of brownstones inhabited by curious children, friendly adults and some odd-looking Muppets has helped shape childhood education by offering exercises, games and life lessons all wrapped up in a television-friendly format. It's a model that's proved durable and influential, says Syracuse University pop culture professor Robert Thompson. ""If I were to make a list of the top 10 most significant American TV shows ... I'd put 'Sesame Street' on the list. The fact that it's still on the air attests to its [significance],"" he said.  See ""Sesame Street"" in pictures Â» . ""The idea they came up with was kind of radical: If you can sell kids sugared cereal and toys using Madison Avenue techniques, why couldn't you use the same techniques for teaching counting, the alphabet and basic social skills? And it works."" Indeed, as Davis notes in ""Street Gang"" (Viking), the genesis of ""Sesame Street"" was when the 3-year-old daughter of a Carnegie foundation executive was fascinated by television, waking up to watch the broadcast day begin and memorizing commercial jingles. He talked about his daughter with a friend, producer Joan Ganz Cooney. In the liberal ferment of the mid-'60s, both wondered whether educational TV could go beyond the staid classroom shows of the era. Cooney became the driving force of ""Sesame Street."" She put together the plan, helped recruit talent, located financing and oversaw production. ""Sesame Street"" became the foundation for the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop), which created other educational shows such as ""The Electric Company"" and ""3-2-1 Contact."" ""She is just such an impressive woman,"" said Davis, adding that Cooney gave her blessing to his book project without any requirements but one: that he ""get it right."" ""She's just one of those extraordinary public figures."" Cooney didn't hold much back in telling her story to Davis, and neither did others. From its debut on November 10, 1969, the show was a hit -- within a year, it was on the cover of Time magazine -- but it was not without its personality clashes. The original Gordon, Matt Robinson, was a producer uncomfortable in the spotlight. Northern Calloway, who played David, struggled with mental illness. The show's primary songwriters, Joe Raposo and Jeff Moss, were constantly in competition; Raposo ""fairly seethed with envy"" when Moss' ""Rubber Duckie"" hit the Top 20, Davis writes. The book provides balanced biographies of a number of principals, including producer Jon Stone, whom Davis calls ""the heart of the book."" ""I wanted people to say, 'Wow, this guy Jon Stone, he really was the Orson Welles of ""Sesame Street."" ' Without him, the show wouldn't have been what it became,"" Davis said. But for all the backstage machinations that affect any creative enterprise, ""Sesame Street"" stayed true to education, in all its forms. One show matter-of-factly included a breast-feeding Buffy Sainte-Marie; others featured a boy with Down syndrome, Jason Kingsley. EW: Stars who dropped by ""Sesame Street"" Jim Henson, who was famous as creator of the Muppets when ""Sesame Street"" began, invented a world of (literally) colorful characters -- Oscar, Big Bird, the Cookie Monster, Bert and Ernie -- and, with his puppeteering crew, gave them soul. And when Mr. Hooper (Will Lee) died, the show dealt with his passing honestly. Over the years, the show has taken its knocks. Critics from the left have complained about its merchandising; critics from the right disliked its avowed commitment to diversity. In the '90s, ""Barney"" stole its thunder, and cable drained its audience. As ""Sesame Street"" comes up on its 40th birthday, some critics wonder whether it's still necessary. But for all that, says Thompson, the show remains important, both in its pioneering educational style and in its clever business model. And it takes its charges seriously, he points out. ""One thing I still like about 'Sesame Street' is that it's not artsy,"" he said. For Davis' part, doing the book -- which succeeded a TV Guide article he did on the show's 35th anniversary -- gave him renewed respect for its creators' achievements. And he's found out through his Web site, http://www.streetgangbook.com/, that ""Sesame Street"" still has the magic to move children -- mothers of autistic children credit the show with helping the kids' development -- and adults. ""Somebody said, 'I was OK when my mom explained to me there was no Santa Claus,' "" he recounts. "" 'But I cried my eyes out the day I realized Kermit was a puppet.' Isn't that great?""","""Street Gang"" is a new book that chronicles the history of ""Sesame Street""

"(Budget Travel) -- For many travelers, duty-free is a luxurious enigma wrapped up in discounted Swiss chocolate and soaked in tax-free vodka. Duty-free goods are mostly sold inside international airport terminals, ferry stations, cruise ports, and border stops. Duty-free shops sell products without local import tax. As the name implies, duty-free shops sell products without duty (a.k.a. local import tax). For example, by buying goods in a duty-free shop at Paris's Charles de Gaulle, you avoid paying the duty that France slaps on imported goods (like Swedish vodka) and that French stores ordinarily include as part of a product's list price. In Europe, there's a bonus perk: Duty-free shops in airports and ports are ""tax-free shops,"" too, which means you are spared the value added tax (or V.A.T., a type of sales tax) that would otherwise be included in the price of goods sold elsewhere in the European Union. That means a savings of between 5 and 25 percent, depending on the country. But there's a catch for duty-free products bought in Europe and elsewhere. If you bring into the U.S. more than $800 worth of items purchased abroad -- duty-free or not -- you'll have to pay the U.S. duty. As a rule of thumb, Americans returning from overseas trips must pay 3 percent on the first $1,000 worth of merchandise over the $800 allowance. Import products worth even more than that and you may be taxed at a higher percentage. In short, duty-free is hit-or-miss for Americans. The best deals are on items labeled ""tax free"" and otherwise taxed heavily -- such as alcohol and cigarettes. You may also find it worthwhile to shop in duty-free stores if you have some local currency left and would rather put it to use than redeem it for dollars (and get hit with the high conversion fee of a bank or currency exchange bureau). Not every duty-free item is a true bargain. Yngve Bia, president of the duty-free research company Generation Research, says price differences depend on two things: geography and currency exchange rates. ""Right now, Heathrow and Gatwick in London offer good deals, especially for liquor, because of the weak British pound,"" he says. For example, a one-liter bottle of Absolut vodka has a typical non-duty-free price of about $30 at retail U.S. shops. But travelers can buy it for just $15 (Â£10) at duty free shops at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports. That's a significant savings. We found impressive discounts on booze elsewhere, too. One liter of Absolut sells for $17.50 (â¬13.50) at duty-free shops at Rome's and Brussels's main international airports, and for a bit more elsewhere, such as in Prague ($18.50, or 399 Czech koruna) and Munich ($21, or â¬16). Those prices offer substantial savings off the $30 benchmark price at a typical U.S. retail store. But be aware that American states may restrict how much alcohol you may import duty-free. There's a typical one-liter limit for all types of alcohol per person, though the rule depends on your state of residence and the country you've visited. (One exception: You can return from a visit to a Caribbean country with up to two liters of alcohol duty-free.) Cigarettes offer similar savings. Gatwick's duty-free shop sells a carton of Marlboro Reds for $36 (Â£24). The same carton goes for $27 (â¬20) at the airport in Rome. In New York -- the state with the highest cigarette tax in the nation -- a carton of Marlboro Reds goes for about $80. In a state with more-typical cigarette taxes, Minnesota, the price of a carton is $44 -- still higher than in duty-free shops. (Note: U.S. customs law allows you to import only up to 200 cigarettes and 100 cigars, whether you bought them at a duty-free shop or not.) But not everything in the duty-free shop is a steal. Duty-free stories once specialized in heavily taxed items, such as alcohol and tobacco products, but now they hawk other products that aren't as deeply discounted. When shopping for cosmetics and fragrances -- which account for almost one third of all duty-free sales -- you need to shop with savvy and persistence. A 1.7-liter bottle of Ralph Lauren Notorious EDP, for example, costs $46 (Â£31) at duty free shops at Gatwick while the Ralph Lauren store in Miami retails it for $59. That's a savings of almost 25 percent. Luxury goods -- defined in duty-free stores as high-end watches, designer-name handbags, and the like -- account for 36 percent of duty-free sales. But you need to comparison shop for these products to make sure that an item is truly on sale. A case in point: Hong Kong International's DFS Galleria, a duty-free shopping area, sells the Armani Obo Bag for $450 (HK$3,500). But shoppers can buy the same bag off Armani's website for about the same price (or, when we checked, on sale for $285). In the end, if an item isn't liquor or cigarettes, be wary, and come prepared. Says Kathy Borrus, author of ""The Fearless Shopper: How to Get the Best Deals on the Planet,"" ""If you know the price of something back home and you go to a duty-free store, you can compare and know what the bargain might be."" Consider that United Airlines sells duty-free products on board many of its planes, and a few items are truly discounted. A Waterford Kilbarry Guilloche Pen sells for $72, which is a savings of $18 off the price at a Waterford store. Get the best travel deals and tips emailed to you FREE - CLICK HERE!

"(Budget Travel) -- If the two forks of Long Island's East End were sisters, the North Fork would undoubtedly be the innocent, modest one. Edgewater Cottage in Orient offers three rental apartments that share a front porch overlooking the water. She has none of the glitz of her southern peninsular twin, the Hamptons. Celebrities don't seem to pay her much attention. She faces the quiet Long Island Sound instead of the lusty open ocean. And instead of a party scene, she offers bucolic countryside dotted with wineries and farm stands. But, as with sex appeal, geographic appeal is a matter of taste. Some of us prefer the North Fork's easygoing charm to her famous sister's haughty glamour. The North Fork may not be as posh as the Hamptons, in other words, but she has a better personality. ""The North Fork is like a young Sonoma,"" says Joe Watson, who opened Vine Wine + CafÃ©, in Greenport, one of the area's biggest villages, in 2006. Long Island's wine country occupied fewer than 20 acres of vineyards some 35 years ago, but today there are more than 4,000 acres. Local wines have been touted in Wine Spectator. This -- in combination with easy access to fresh seafood and produce -- has attracted a thriving group of epicures. Chef Tom Colicchio (of Top Chef fame, owner of the Craft restaurant empire, and cofounder of Manhattan's tony Gramercy Tavern) bought a house here in 2004. The area has not, however, become too enamored of its own success. Towns have been gently burnished, but their rural character has remained unchanged. ""This is the last vestige of what all of Long Island used to be,"" says Chris Baiz, owner of The Old Field Vineyards in Southold. Budget Travel gallery: Check out this mellow wine scene . Only about 75 miles from Manhattan, the North Fork juts into the Long Island Sound, separated from the Hamptons by the Peconic Bay. The peninsula itself is only about 30 miles long. At Riverhead, strip malls begin to give way to open spaces and, every few miles, a speck of a village just off the road. First Mattituck, then Cutchogue, Greenport, and at the far tip, Orient. When my husband and I turn off Main Road (Route 25) and arrive in Greenport on Friday afternoon, we wander down a quiet side street to Vine. We've been told it's a good spot to start sampling North Fork wines: The restaurant serves a dozen local varieties by the taste, the glass or the bottle. The carefully considered restaurant and wine bar occupies an old-fashioned house on a corner lot and has plenty of outdoor seating on a front porch and a terrace. It's hard to imagine that when Watson first started coming out to the area 10 years ago, much of the town's main street was vacant. ""Greenport was still a shambles,"" he recalls. ""So many houses have been bought and fixed up now. It's becoming a cute little village, like Sag Harbor but not as precious."" A meal can be assembled from the various small bites or more substantial dishes on the menu, but Watson says he wants to keep the focus on wine. ""I love when people have a couple of glasses of wine and some olives, and just hang out,"" he says. And that sounds like a fine way to spend a weekend. On Saturday, we begin hunting and gathering. Many of the area wineries encourage visitors to bring a picnic to go along with their wine, and we stop at some farm stands for provisions. On Main Road in the village of Cutchogue, Wickham's Fruit Farm has been operated by the same family for about 70 years. Fresh doughnuts (cinnamon, plain, or sugar) are brought out by the plateful, and there are jars of jam, containers of flavored honey sticks, a table of pies and pick-your-own fruit out back. I settle for some fresh-baked bread, a pint of strawberries and homemade cucumber salad for our alfresco feast. We reach the Shinn Estate Vineyards in Mattituck in time to share our picnic spread and taste some wine before catching a tour of the grounds by owner-vintner Barbara Shinn. Shinn and her husband, David Page, established their vineyard in 2000 and later sold their acclaimed Home Restaurant in Greenwich Village. They were determined to run a completely organic farm despite numerous warnings that it was an impossible feat with the fluctuating East Coast weather conditions. Through a combination of experimentation and perseverance, they have succeeded in creating a sustainable vineyard. Instead of chemical-based treatments, their biodynamic approach means rows are lush with overgrown grass and flowers that attract beneficial bugs -- a natural pest control for the vines. ""Out here, you realize how fragile the ecosystem is,"" Shinn says. When Shinn and Page bought the farm, their immediate goal was to keep the land from being developed. The gaping hole between the declining profitability of farming and the soaring property values made the area vulnerable. Shinn and Page have been able to protect their land in perpetuity thanks to a law that allows them to get cash rewards for signing away their development rights to government authorities. ""Farmers are paid to preserve the land,"" says Shinn. Because rosÃ© wines are among my favorites, we head to Southold's Croteaux Vineyards. They specialize in rosÃ©s, and their four offerings have notes like peach, cherry and vanilla. The property has five buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries, and the shady courtyard with red wrought-iron furniture looks a bit like a Hollywood fantasy of a vineyard setting -- but it's real. We make our way to the very tip of the North Fork, and just before the town of Orient, a narrow bridge of land affords a view of a handful of large gracious homes along the shoreline. On the main street, Village Lane, the houses suddenly shrink, giving Orient the feel of a Victorian-era Lilliput. Perhaps in size they are cottages, but many look more like brightly painted toy mansions. At the curve in Village Lane, we come to a small harbor and find swans swimming in the ocean. Right at this spot is Edgewater Cottage, which has three apartments that share a front porch overlooking the water and a private strip of sandy beach. Many of the affordable places to stay on the North Fork are '60s-era motels that have a certain kitschy appeal but generally fall into the category of adequate. The airy, cedar-shingled Edgewater is a refreshing anomaly. The apartments -- with Shaker-style chairs and checked tablecloths -- are simple in a way that's well suited to the setting. On Sunday morning, we make it to the Love Lane Kitchen by 10 a.m., when tables are still plentiful. Wise move, since by 11 there's a wait outside. The home-style food (a big jug of real maple syrup for the thick French toast), friendly staff and low-key vibe (a large self-serve coffee setup...why doesn't every breakfast spot do this?) make me fervently wish the cafÃ© was located around the corner from my house. I also wish we were around long enough to come back for dinner: Love Lane's uncomplicated menu hits that sweet spot between the area's beachy eats and fussy white-tablecloth options. As we head back out toward more wine tasting, I spot the sign for Catapano Dairy Farm in Peconic, and we do a quick U-turn. Our reward: a private audience with a contented herd of goat kids. Catapano's fresh chÃ¨vre, also sold at many of the local farm stands, is delicately flavored and so creamy-soft that it's almost fluffy (the American Cheese Society named it the country's best goat cheese in 2005). If you were to pick a winery that best represents the North Fork idyll, the Old Field would be it. It has been farmed by Chris Baiz's family for 90 years. He and his wife, Ros, bought the farm from their relatives to save it from being sold and subdivided. ""We decided this was something we needed to do,"" explains Ros. ""Otherwise this land was going to be developed, and that seemed like a horrible, horrible thing to do."" One end of the property faces Main Road, and the other fronts Southold Bay. (The Baizes are growing oysters there this year.) Large, rambling and relaxed, the Old Field is shaded by enormous, ancient trees and has its own pond, plus bay views. The property, largely unchanged for 150 years, is scattered with old buildings and barns. You can take a tour of the vineyard to learn about the grapes, wine making and the harvest. But you can just as easily wander off to sit under a tree with the new release, Blush de Noir rosÃ©. I make a point of stopping in to some of the midsize and larger wineries before heading back to Manhattan. At Pindar Vineyards, the biggest, a crowd of 35 people taste from more than 20 options, dozens of bottles of wine are stacked on a counter, and across the field a warehouse building bears a massive company logo. But the staff is jolly, and there's a large covered deck out back for drinking and relaxing. It's a different kind of social scene -- more bar than family room. I miss the small vineyards I experienced first. Talking with the owners, hearing their love for their grapes, seeing their determination to preserve the North Fork's open spaces -- all of this while sitting in what are essentially their backyards -- just makes the wine taste better.

"(CNN) -- To say the gone-too-soon series ""Firefly"" has a devoted fan base might be the biggest understatement in sci-fi fandom. Eight years after Fox grounded the crew from Serenity, a loyal following still longs for any chance to return to director Joss Whedon's fully realized mashup of outer space and the Old West. Luckily for them, Whedon is a comic-book fan. In 2005's ""Serenity: Those Left Behind"" and 2008's ""Serenity: Better Days"" -- both produced by Whedon for Dark Horse Comics -- we get to see Captain Mal and friends in action. Now, with ""Serenity: Float Out,"" there's a chance to stop in for a more personal visit with one of the crew's most beloved characters. ""Float Out,"" released Thursday by Dark Horse, is written by actor, comedian and ""Firefly"" devotee Patton Oswalt based on an idea he floated to Whedon. It focuses on Wash, the wise-cracking ace pilot whose stunning death at the end of ""Serenity"" can still bring some devoted browncoats to tears with a single mention. The one-off book opens with three friends of Wash (full name: Hoban Washburne) pausing to remember him before christening a new ship -- The Jetwash -- in his honor. That setup serves as an excuse to flash back to three stories from Wash's past, each showing a different side of his endearing personality. Diehard fans won't learn a whole lot about Wash that they didn't already know. And anyone hoping to see the entire Serenity crew back together will be disappointed. But Wash and surprise endings apparently go together. There's a big one in the book's final pages -- one that both offers a huge emotional payoff for ""Firefly"" fans and will have them desperately hoping for more. Different from Whedon's fully involved ""Buffy"" series on Dark Horse, the occasional ""Serenity"" books feel like brief visits with old friends. And ""Float Out"" is a good one. The next visit is scheduled for November, when ""Serenity: The Shepherd's Tale,"" a look at the backstory of Shepherd Book, is due to be released.","New ""Serenity"" comic focuses on fan favorite Wash .

"Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Larry King's autobiography, ""My Remarkable Journey,"" published by Weinstein books. Larry King anchors ""Larry King Live"" at 9 p.m. ET on CNN. Larry, left, at age 10 with his younger brother, Marty, shortly after their father died. I was walking home from the library carrying nine books. That's the way my memory sees it. I can't know for sure if it was exactly nine books. Maybe I picture nine books because I was nine years old. I'm certain that I was nine years old, because I'm sure of the date -- June 9, 1943. There were a lot of books under my arm on that summer day because I loved books. I wonder what happened to those nine books ... There were three squad cars in front of my apartment building. Flivvers, we called them. I don't remember exactly when I started to hear my mother's screams. But as I hurried up the steps, a cop quickly came down, straight for me. He picked me up and the books went flying. Watch Larry on his ""Remarkable journey"" Â» . I'm not sure if I knew the cop. But I may have. For years, before the war started and my father went to work in the defense plant, he'd owned a little neighborhood bar and grill. He was friendly with all the cops. The cops loved my father the way they loved any bar owner who had a great sense of humor. I remember having my own police costume when I was very young. A badge and a little nightstick came with it. I'd make like I was walking the beat. The cop put me in the squad car. He told me that my father had died. Heart attack. I didn't cry. I remember that. I didn't cry. I was more befuddled than anything else. It must have been difficult for the cop. He started the car and drove. We wound through the streets of Brownsville and ended up at a movie theater. I'll never forget the movie, Bataan, starring Robert Taylor as Sergeant Bill Dane. It was about a bunch of American soldiers trying to stave off the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Larry King's life in pictures Â» . Sergeant Dane and his patrol are ordered to blow up a bridge to stop the advancing enemy. They're cut down one by one until only Sergeant Dane and two others remain. The first is killed by a sniper. The second is stabbed by a Japanese soldier who'd been playing dead. The movie ends with Sergeant Dane firing his machine gun straight into the camera at the Japanese soldiers coming at him in one last act of courage and defiance. I don't remember what it was like when I got home that day. A lot about that day I've blocked out. My younger brother Marty has blocked it out, too. He was only six at the time. But there are a few more memories attached. I didn't go to the funeral. I'd been so close to my father -- yet I refused to go. I stayed at home. There must've been somebody watching me, but I remember being alone. I remember bouncing a spaldeen -- the Spalding rubber ball we used to play stickball -- off the front stoop. Two other things I can tell you for sure. I never went back to that library again, and from that day on I was nervous if I saw a squad car in my neighborhood. If one parked by my apartment building, I'd start running home, in fear that my mother had died.","Larry was 9 years old when his father died of a heart attack in 1943 .

"(Budget Travel) -- No offense to the nation's capital, but the landmarks of our heritage extend far beyond the District of Columbia. Yellowstone National Park preserves an enormous natural bounty, including 10,000 hot springs and 300 geysers. Sears Tower (Willis Tower) It's fitting that the country's tallest building, the Sears Tower (we haven't come to terms with the new name either), is in the same city that built the first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building, demolished in 1931. Chicago's innovation sparked a worldwide race that continues to redefine city skylines from London to Dubai to Taipei. There's simply no better way to experience those early architects' remarkable vision than to stand on The Ledge at Skydeck Chicago, a transparent observation box that suspends you 1,353 feet above street level, on a wisp of glass just one and a half inches thick. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania . The site of the Civil War's bloodiest battle and of one of Abraham Lincoln's most famous speeches, Gettysburg National Military Park is a lasting memorial to the devastation caused by, and the reasons for, the war that remade the union. In its successful efforts to fend off encroaching development, Gettysburg also reflects the struggles of many historic sites to preserve the sanctity of their land. nps.gov/gett. Yellowstone National Park . Yes, other National Parks are stunning (Grand Canyon and Yosemite come to mind), but Yellowstone, signed into being by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, was the very first in the world -- and established an early precedent for land conservationists internationally. This majestic park, bordered by Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, preserves an enormous natural bounty: It is home to 10,000 hot springs and 300 geysers, numerous lakes and rivers, and wildlife such as bighorn sheep, bison, grizzly bears, and more than 1,000 gray wolves. nps.gov/yell. New York Harbor . It's still easy to imagine the bay as millions of immigrants might have perceived it on their way to the United States: the promise of the Statue of Liberty, the judgment of Ellis Island, and the hope of Manhattan's skyscrapers rising in the distance. Emma Lazarus's ode to the huddled masses, inside the Statue of Liberty's pedestal, is a timeless reminder of our common bond as immigrants, a history that stretches from Jamestown to the current day. Budget Travel gallery: See the 8 sights . Monticello . Why Thomas Jefferson and not George Washington, you ask? It's undeniable that Washington was the greater warrior, but it was Jefferson who authored the Declaration of Independence and helped define our claim to liberty -- the reason we fought in the first place. Monticello, located in Charlottesville, Virginia, is filled with more than 5,000 of Jefferson's prized artifacts, like botanic microscopes, an illustrated engraving of the Declaration of Independence, and elk antlers from the Lewis and Clark Expedition (which Jefferson sponsored). The residence provides a fascinating exhibition of the progressive, transformative ideas of its owner. monticello.org. Graceland   Born in Mississippi and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Elvis Presley incorporated the homegrown sounds of the Delta blues and country music into his songs, and then shared them with the rest of the world. Graceland, his home in Memphis, is a similar melting pot of styles and tastes. Like his music, it's American through and through. Among the highlights: two private jets named Lisa Marie and Hound Dog II, five gold-plated showerheads, and in the car museum across the street, 10 of the King's favorite rides, including his famous pink Cadillac. elvis.com/graceland. Pearl Harbor . The bombing of Pearl Harbor transformed a sleepy, remote naval base in Hawaii into a fiery catalyst for America's entry into World War II. Within the space of a few hours, the U.S. Pacific naval fleet was devastated, more than 2,300 servicemen died, and the nation united around a common cause. It's hard to imagine a more poignant memorial than the Alfred Preis-designed bridge that hovers over the midsection of the sunken battleship, the USS Arizona, which remains the underwater grave for 1,177 of her crewmen. nps.gov/valr. Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church . The struggle for racial equality has taken place all over the country, but for Martin Luther King Jr., it began in Atlanta, Georgia, at the church where he was baptized, delivered his first sermon, and served as co-pastor with his father until his death in 1968. His soaring speeches clarified the goals of the civil rights movement and extended the country's promise of freedom; his example of nonviolence remains an astounding contribution to the country's history of dissent. Note: The parish has grown into a larger building across the street (where visitors can attend services); the historic church is now part of a National Historic Site that includes his birth home and grave. The church is closed until the end of 2009 for restoration. nps.gov/malu, historicebenezer.org. WHAT, NO GRAND CANYON?

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Breakfast, beer breaks and goat's-milk ice cream: The ultimate two-day tasting itinerary in Turkey's largest city. Savor the flavors of Istanbul in between visits to the city's landmarks. Day 1: Sultanahmet (The Old City) Breakfast . On a street lined with carpet shops near the Arasta Bazaar, Tamara Restaurant (breakfast for two $20), whose owners hail from Turkey's eastern Lake Van area, serves up the region's puffy breads, herb-flecked otlu cheese, and addictive tahini spread. Eggs baked with spicy soujuk sausage might seem like overkill, but order them anyway. Mid-Morning Fix . It would be a crime to miss the SÃ¼leymaniye Camii mosque, an Ottoman masterpiece; it would be sadder still not to visit the nearby Vefa Bozacisi (boza for two $4). Decked out in weathered marble, this vintage cubbyhole specializes in boza -- a cross between pudding and a beverage, which is made from fermented bulgur. Traditionally it's consumed with leblebi, nutty roasted chickpeas. Lunch . Famished after haggling for kilims at the Covered Bazaar? It's worth tracking down Seyhmus (lunch for two $30), a macho kebab dive colonized by gaggles of mustached vendors. Order lahmacun -- wafer-thin lamb-slathered pizza -- with seyhmus kebap (an epic charcoal-grilled lamb patty) and a vegetable salad dressed with pomegranate molasses. Washing your meal down with ayran, a tart yogurt drink, is a sure way to pass for a local. Beer Break . Unwind with a frosty glass of Efes Pilsen on the rooftop terrace of Seven Hills Hotel (drinks for two $10), which feels like it is suspended between the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia against the backdrop of the Marmara Sea. Dinner . Though certain Istanbullus swear that fish should be eaten at the water's edge, the suave, smart-suited businessmen and bejeweled matrons who patronize BalikÃ§i Sabahattin (dinner for two $65) know better. A waiter appears as soon as you settle in your seat, carrying a tray of meze, small plates meant to be sampled with raki, Turkey's signature anise liquor. Order platters of smoky eggplant salad and buttery lakerda (cured bonito) -- then choose grilled levrek (sea bass), moist and perfectly cooked. Travel + Leisure: World's top late-night restaurants . Day 2: Other Neighborhoods . Breakfast . Even if contemporary Turkish art isn't your cup of Ã§ay, visit Istanbul Modern (breakfast for two $45), a museum in a renovated warehouse, for its stylish cafÃ© and waterfront terrace. With luck, giant cruise ships won't obstruct the postcard-perfect view of the Old Town as you tuck into a breakfast of simit (sesame bread rings), creamy beyaz peynir (feta), crunchy cucumbers, and sour-cherry jam. Ice Cream . Farther along the Bosporus road, stop in the village of OrtakÃ¶y for a stroll through craft shops and the neo-Baroque mosque. At Mado (ice cream for two $2), sample the goat's-milk ice cream, which is thickened with the powdered root of wild orchids. Splurge on a triple scoop of pistachio, pomegranate, and black mulberry. Lunch . Continue on to Sabanci University Sakip Sabanci Museum, a 19th-century mansion in Emirgan that houses an impressive collection of Ottoman paintings. Espousing a different aesthetic, the museum's Muzedechanga restaurant (lunch for two $98) is noted for its neo-60s interior of unpolished oak and black-leather banquettes. Try the olive oil-braised celery root enlivened with tangerine, and rosy lamb chops, from the smart modern-Mediterranean menu. Drinks . Time your visit to Leb-i Derya (drinks for two $16) with the sunset -- and the evening call to prayer. That's when young locals file in for cocktails, like fresh-ginger-and-muddled-lime mojitos, and jockey for steel stools on the open-air terrace overlooking the city's two coastlines and the Bosporus strait in between. Dinner . Beyoglu is known for its raucous drinking houses, or meyhane, where meze are an excuse for rivers of raki. The insiders' favorite is Kallavi (dinner for two $50), a brick-walled dining room illuminated by chandeliers that sets the scene for house specials like ficin, a spiced meat pie. The best part? Watching beau monders stomp their heels to the Turkish band's beat. Wait, is that your wife tossing banknotes at the dashing oud player? Planning a beach getaway?

"(Budget Travel) -- Some of my greatest travel memories are about exploring the local markets -- digging through the goods, chatting with vendors, feeling my way through the nuances of a spirited negotiation. Each time, I walk away with an earful of native lore and insider info -- on top of armfuls of awesome finds. The Springfield Antique Show and Flea Market in Ohio takes place one weekend each month, excluding February and July. Once, I picked up a pair of swingy silver earrings at a market in Uruguay and simultaneously bagged a tip for the best spot to dance to candombe music, something the seller insisted I do while wearing my new purchase. It was just the kind of authentic encounter I'd never have found in a shop on the main drag. Each of these American markets will leave you with that same richness of experience -- as well as heaps of quality souvenirs. Who needs another plastic snow globe, anyway? BRIMFIELD ANTIQUE & FLEA MARKET SHOWS . Where & when: Brimfield, Massachusetts; six consecutive days each in mid-May, July and September. What: A local auctioneer, Gordon Reid, started this outdoor market, now the country's largest, on a somewhat humbler stage back in 1959: his own backyard. Now, more than 1 million visitors flood in every year to shop the peerless selection of affordable New England collectibles (weather vanes, decoys and Nantucket baskets) and maritime accoutrements (brass lamps and ships' wheels) spread across more than 20 ""fields"" on either side of the town's main road, each containing hundreds of vendors. Budget Travel: 20 great flea markets around the world . Three of the best fields are Dealer's Choice, known for its quality rustic furniture; Heart-O-The Mart, favored for hobnail glassware and intact grain sacks; and J&J Auction Acres, flush with high-end items like colonial cherrywood chests and convex mirrors. Even the food has a regional bent: Try the generously sized $10 lobster rolls, the fresh-popped kettle corn, and the Pilgrim Sandwich, a supersoft roll layered with roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo. brimfield.com. Best shot at a bargain: The slower July and September markets may yield better deals than the crowded May outing, which serves as the region's antiquing-season opener. Gigi's find: A portable radio.

Budget Travel gallery: See these cool flea markets . SPRINGFIELD ANTIQUE SHOW & FLEA MARKET . Where & when: Springfield, Ohio; one weekend each month, excluding February and July. What: Over the course of its quarter-century run, this busy market held on a county fairground has won a reputation as the heartland's go-to source for all things folky and primitive, such as old metal pails, Shaker boxes, cross-stitched samplers, and calico quilts. Farmhouse antiques, like blanket chests, milk-paint cupboards, and sturdy rocking chairs also figure prominently, as do well-preserved dishware and tabletop items. Budget Travel: How to shop every market like a pro . During each year's three supersize Extravaganzas -- in May, June, and September -- the number of vendors swells to more than 2,500, some operating out of cattle barns and poultry houses. Visit the market's online discussion forum to connect with sellers, preview goods, and even post wish lists. springfieldantiqueshow.com. Best shot at a bargain: Go in September, when dealers are trying to liquidate their stock for the winter. BROOKLYN FLEA . Where & when: Brooklyn, New York; Saturdays from mid-April through Thanksgiving. What: In less than two years, this sale in a Brooklyn schoolyard has attracted a large enough following to justify a second location and seasonal spin-off events. Shoppers come for the mix of vintage clothing and jewelry, architectural salvage, and decorative objects like modernist table lamps and metal desk fans dating from the early to mid-1900s. Alongside the secondhand-goods sellers, you'll find booths from local designers of reclaimed-wood furniture, handmade shoes, and more. The food stands are just as diverse: Celebrated taco vendors, cheesemongers, and bakers all make weekly appearances. brooklynflea.com. Best shot at a bargain: Many of the antiques vendors are willing to cut deals on their merchandise, but the proprietors of new goods tend to keep their prices firm. Gigi's find: ""I bought this desk calendar for $30 at the Brooklyn Flea from one of my favorite sellers, Three Potato Four; the owners come up from Virginia every couple of months to sell. Their stuff is the best sort of a happy-industrial meets old-school-classroom vibe."" THE ALAMEDA POINT ANTIQUES & COLLECTIBLES FAIRE . Where & when: Alameda, California; first Sunday of each month. What: The San Francisco skyline and the hills of Marin County serve as a cinematic backdrop for this 800-plus-vendor market on the main runway of a decommissioned naval base on San Francisco Bay. Organizers enforce a 20-year-minimum age rule for sale items, which guarantees you'll be shopping for real-deal relics (like French travel posters, Hollywood movie memorabilia, and early-20th-century Japanese pottery), not tables of tube socks and cheap electronics. The layout is clear and intuitive, with long, evenly spaced rows arranged in a grid; thoughtful touches like pushcarts for hauling heavy purchases, a porcelain-repair kiosk, and free parking with a shuttle service add to the appeal. There's even a handy printable map on the market's Web site. antiquesbybay.com. Best shot at a bargain: Fewer sellers turn out from January through March, but those who do are often more eager to negotiate. Gigi's find: ""I grew up in Texas, where learning to play dominoes is a rite of passage. I've been collecting vintage sets from various flea markets over the years, including [one] from Alameda Point."" 127 CORRIDOR SALE . Where & when: From West Unity, Ohio, to Gadsden, Alabama; first weekend in August. What: For sheer variety, nothing tops the World's Longest Yard Sale, a bargain-hunter's paradise that meanders along 654 miles of scenic rural highway. Seasoned dealers in formal tents as well as locals unloading the contents of their attics set up shop roadside, hawking crocheted table linens, boxes of fishing lures, weathered iron bed frames, and garden statuary. There isn't one stretch of road that's consistently the best, so let regional attractions narrow your focus: In Tennessee alone, you can stay the night in a tepee or a log cabin and make a pit stop to pick wild blueberries at Pickett State Park. 127sale.com. Best shot at a bargain: At a sale this vast, it's simply all about persistence. Get the best travel deals and tips emailed to you FREE - CLICK HERE!

"(CNN) -- Pressure is growing for world leaders to respond to Syria's brutal crackdown on anti-regime protests. Earlier this week, the United Nations' Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, said more than 5,000 people had been killed in Syria since the uprising began in March. The Syrian government has issued activists in the restive city of Homs an ultimatum: Cease their protests, or face bombardment, prompting fears of an increase in hostilities. Human rights activists have called for an international response to the violence -- but some diplomats have warned that any intervention could make the situation worse. Mousab Azzawi, of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said events in Syria amounted to a ""humanitarian crisis,"" just like that seen in Libya prior to the NATO intervention, and that the situation merited a similar response. ""When the international community went to Libya to protect civilians, were they deceiving [everyone]?"" he told CNN's Connect the World. ""Because if the principle of protecting civilians is the motivation of the international community, what happens in Syria is no different from what happened in Libya -- it's the same atrocities, the same tyranny and the same crimes against humanity committed there."" But Oliver Miles, a former British ambassador to Libya, said there was no comparison between the two countries -- or between Syria and Iraq, another high-profile example of international intervention. ""Syria is different in many, many ways. Iraq was invaded by a foreign government, and seven, eight years later, is in ruins,"" he said. ""Libya was not invaded by a foreign government; in Libya there was an uprising which so far seems to have succeeded in overthrowing a tyranny and is on the way to building something to replace that tyranny. ""Syria bears no resemblance to either of them. Syria is a larger country than Libya, it's a more complicated country than Libya, it doesn't offer any scope for foreign intervention."" Refugees seek shelter in Lebanon . Miles said politicians and diplomats were unlikely to take major action against the Syrian regime without backing from the U.N. -- and that such support was unlikely. ""I think the situation in Syria is absolutely dreadful, and if I could think of a way that the British government, or any other government, or the United Nations could intervene effectively, I would be all for it, but I think intervention would probably make things worse,"" he told CNN. ""When foreign air forces started to take part in the Libyan struggle back in March, they had a clear mandate from the United Nations, which meant that under international law, what we did could be argued to be legal. ""There is no possibility whatsoever that we will get a mandate from the United Nations to intervene in Syria as things stand at the moment."" But Azzawi said such pragmatic attitudes were making the situation worse, accusing foreign powers who failed to act of ""participating in the bloodshed in Syria"" by default. And he said he feared the influence of Syrian military defectors, the Free Syrian Army, on the protests -- unless the fighters were offered international support. ""The numbers of the Free Syrian Army -- without being supported by the international community -- is so small now, and the big risk is when these peaceful demonstrators are tempted by the FSA to hold arms and then we move to a stage of militarizing the uprising, which is a very big risk. ""The people in Syria are trying hard to stick to the principle of peacefulness,"" he said. ""I don't think that will last forever, but if we have militarization of the uprising, then we will heed to a civil war and I think this is the last thing the international community wants to see in Syria, because any civil war in Syria would be spreading very quickly to the neighboring countries."" CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report .","Human rights activists call for an international response to violence in Syria .

"(Sunset) -- Hawaii may seem a world away, but there are plenty of big waves, tiny bubbles and tiki-style spots closer to home. Here are some San Diego-based ways to catch the Hawaiian spirit. Paradise Point Resort and Spa is a waterfront oasis with a Balinese-style spa and five swimming pools. Make your own lei . If a luau is on your tropical to-do list, the Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa offers a demo and the materials to design a floral garland for the event. A needle and thread, a pile of seasonal flowers such as plumerias, orchids, mini carnations and tuberose, and the rest is up to you. The resort's resident tropical macaw and cockatoo birds might make an appearance while you're at work. Leis stay fragrant and can last more than a week if you refrigerate them and mist with water periodically. A sunset luau . It's TGIF, Hawaiian-style. The Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa throws a Friday-night luau on the lawn by Mission Bay -- and that means hula dancers in grass skirts, fire knife dancing, piÃ±a coladas, tiki torches, a ceremonial roast pig on parade and Polynesian drumbeats from a live band. Dances and costumes come from different parts of Polynesia (Tahiti, Samoa and even New Zealand, as well as Hawaii). It's faux Hawaii, of course, but the festivities are enough to spark your island imagination. An ocean adventure . Bright orange Garibaldi fish, leopard sharks, giant sea turtles, sea lions and seven sea caves to explore -- it's not Kauai, it's La Jolla Shores. The caves are just a half-mile from shore via kayak, and OEX Dive & Kayak Center offers two-hour tours that include guided trips inside the Clam -- one of just two caves you can enter (at high tide, you can go all the way through). Sunset.com: Discover the West's top 10 beaches . August is a prime month to be out on the water with the warm temps and calm swells. About those silhouettes gliding underneath the boats: Hundreds (sometimes even thousands) of leopard sharks swim below the kayaks, and they're most abundant in summer. Thankfully, leopard sharks have small teeth (they use suction to eat). For the daring, snorkeling is another option. Sunset.com: Take the teens to Kauai . Tiki-style . Mister Tiki Mai Tai Lounge -- the name alone promises tropical cocktails and Polynesian kitsch. The giant tiki masks on the walls, tableside lava lamps and handblown glass blowfish on the ceilings add to the tropical flavor of this spot in downtown's Gaslamp Quarter. The drinks are pure tiki -- try the lilikoi mojitos with white rum, passion fruit, fresh mint and lime, or a coconut kiss martini with coconut rum, pineapple and coconut cream (with an orchid floating on top). The happy hour (5-7 p.m.; $5) includes sushi rolls and pupus (Hawaiian appetizers) like shiitake-goat cheese wontons. Hang 10 . Surfing isn't just the sport of beach bums. These days anyone can ride a wave, and La Jolla Shores Beach is great for beginners, with its sandy-bottom shoreline and small waves. Surf Diva, a surf school started by twin-sister surfers in 1996, gives private or group surf lessons (wetsuit and board included). Lessons start on the sand, where you'll learn how to paddle, pop up and master the surf stance before you hit the water. Sunset.com: Blue Hawaii . 48 hours of aloha in San Diego . Friday: Two tropical-themed spots to stay are Paradise Point Resort & Spa, a waterfront oasis with a Balinese-style spa and five swimming pools (from $259), or the Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa (from $249) with koi ponds, gardens, and a beach on Mission Bay. Hit the Catamaran Resort first for lei-making (3:30 Fri through Sep 4; $10), then stay for the weekly Friday-night luau with Hawaiian music, fire dancing, and hula (6 p.m. Fri through Sep 4; $35, $15 ages 5--12; nonguests $58, $25 ages 5--12); 3999 Mission Blvd.; tickets at catamaranresort.com/luau). Saturday: Kayak to see the La Jolla Caves with OEX Dive & Kayak Center (tours 11, 1, 3; from $40; 2158 Avenida de la Playa; 858/454-6195). Have lunch at Aloha Sushi Lounge ($$; 7731 Fay Ave.; 858/551-5000). Drive to the nearby Pacific Beach neighborhood to Motu Hawaii (4150 Mission Blvd., Ste. 115; 858/272-6688), where you can buy a fresh flower lei (from $10). Just blocks away is the gargantuan Pangaea Outpost (909 Garnet Ave.; 858/581-0555) with more than 70 spaces, some selling tropical soaps or tiki partyware. It's a 20-minute drive to the Gaslamp Quarter to dine at Mister Tiki Mai Tai Lounge ($$; 801 Fifth Ave.; 619/233-1183).

"(CNN) -- As everyone but the citizens of Gotham City knows, Batman is Bruce Wayne. But lately, he's been Dick Grayson. And this month, he's also Damian Wayne and Terry McGinnis. Will the real Batman please stand up? This look at Batman's past, present and future has been brought about by Grant Morrison, the Scottish writer and playwright behind the award-winning ""All-Star Superman."" Morrison has masterminded a new direction for the character and returns to the 70-year-old ""Batman"" comic book series with its 700th issue Wednesday. ""I started to do a bunch of research, and I realized that every story had been told,"" Morrison said. He decided upon a psychological deconstruction of the character that would run over many issues and over two years, beginning with the story arc ""Batman & Son"" in 2006. In order to bring Morrison's master plan to fruition, to ""set up a whole new status quo"" for Batman, as he puts it, Bruce Wayne would have to be driven to the brink of insanity and ultimately killed, as he was in the mega-crossover story ""Final Crisis."" For the past year, Bruce's onetime ward Dick has been Batman, and his son Damian has taken over for Robin, in a Batman and Robin series lighter in tone than what we've been used to in the past few decades. This has all led up to ""Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne,"" currently in the middle of its six-issue run, in which Bruce -- or his consciousness at least -- travels through time on his way back to the present day. All of these plot threads culminate in the 700th issue, which tells stories of the Batman of the past (Bruce), present (Dick) and future (Damian), interpreted by three different artists. ""I wanted to sum up all of the things we love about Batman over the years and kind of see that moment where the Caped Crusader becomes the Dark Knight,"" Morrison explained. ""[All of the stories] connect in an interesting way. We also have a section looking at all the different future Batmen. It's an attempt to do every version of Batman."" Indeed, Morrison is hard-pressed to choose a favorite interpretation of Batman. He has a great appreciation for all of them, from the campy 1960s TV series to Frank Miller's gritty 1980s graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"" to the current movies directed by Christopher Nolan. ""Batman has been around 70 years. He's been a comedy figure. He was a sci-fi superhero in the '50s."" If he had to pick one, Morrison would go with the version of Batman as the world's greatest detective, as seen in the 1970s stories written by the legendary Denny O'Neil. O'Neil is returning for a special one-shot story himself this month. ""We like to revisit the people that made the character great,"" said Dan DiDio, co-publisher of DC Comics (owned by Time Warner, which is also the parent company of CNN). ""We pull him out of retirement every once in a while for Batman. It's not an anniversary party without him."" If that's not enough, DC has two more Bat-related mini-series starting this month. One is ""Batman Beyond,"" based on the fan favorite animated series with Terry McGinnis as another future version of Batman. This series officially brings the character into DC Universe canon. ""The fans have been looking for this for a while,"" DiDio said. ""This looked like the perfect opportunity to reintroduce him."" Meanwhile, the secret past of another once ""deceased"" character, Jason Todd, the second Robin, is explored in ""Red Hood: Lost Days."" Is Jason more a hero or villain? Morrison said, ""He's an antihero, which is really good, and people like that. He's not an evil villain; he's just a fallen superhero."" As for Morrison's plans, he's sticking around the Batcave for a few more years. ""I kind of figured [the story] would end, but it kept developing strands that were interesting."" After that, he's pondering changing the status quo of a certain Amazon princess: ""I've done my Superman story, and I've done my Batman. ... It would be great to do one for Wonder Woman.""","Presumed-dead Bruce Wayne is returning to Batman comic books .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Portland, Oregon, doesn't lack for fashionable boutique hotels, but to the west, along the Pacific Ocean, the options have tended to be as primal as the shoreline. Recently, however, a group of properties has sprung up on the northern coast, aiming to seduce 21st-century travelers with designs steeped in post-World War II Modernism. The Cannery Pier Hotel was built on the site of a fish-packing facility on the Columbia River. Each stop on this easy three-night itinerary provides a stylish Oregon beach getaway -- along with postcard-worthy water views. Day 1: Portland to Astoria . Follow the Columbia River Highway (U.S. 30) as it meanders along the waterway that led Lewis and Clark to the sea. (For more shore-hugging river views, cross the Oregon Way Bridge, just west of Rainier, and drive on Washington's Ocean Beach Highway -- but be sure to return to Route 30 by crossing back over at Cathlamet.) Make your way to Astoria, the oldest American settlement west of the Rockies (founded in 1811), a revitalized former fishing town with Victorian architecture and a restored 1913 riverfront trolley. Take in the town -- and the mouth of the Columbia River -- from the 125-foot Astoria Column, and for a dramatic close-up of the Astoria Bridge, which connects Oregon and Washington, check in to the Cannery Pier Hotel (doubles from $299). Built on the site of a fish-packing facility on a pier that extends 600 feet into the river, the four-year-old hotel embraces a Pacific Northwest version of loft architecture, with exposed steel beams in the atrium-style lobby and hardwood floors in the 46 balconied rooms. The best place to eat is just a short stroll down the pier at the Bridgewater Bistro (dinner for two $75; 503/ 325-6777). The restaurant offers exceptional views of the river and bridge, a tasting room for the Oregon Coast's Flying Dutchman Winery, and a small-plates menu featuring watermelon-and-feta salad and a savory cheesecake with Dungeness crab. Day 2: Astoria to Arch Cape . The Oregon Coast Highway (U.S. 26) crosses Youngs Bay and snakes southward almost to Arch Cape, set in the lush green terrain of Oswald West State Park. It's a 30-mile trip that passes through the monied enclave of Gearhart, as well as Seaside, one of the first beach resorts in Oregon. Travel + Leisure: 45 best new hotels of 2009 . Be sure to explore the Cannon Beach art colony, comprising 19 galleries and crafts studios; then hit the sand to behold Haystack Rock, a 235-foot-tall basalt formation that's the third-largest such ocean monolith in the world. You might also want to scope out a spot for dinner in Cannon Beach -- locals love the French-Italian dishes such as pesto-and-prawn pasta at Newmans at 988 (dinner for two $110, 503/ 436-1151) -- or stock up on Oregon wine and Tillamook cheese before heading to Arch Cape, a tiny residential community with no restaurants. It is here that Bruce Bessey transformed an old beach house into the Ocean Point Inn & Spa (doubles from $275). The three handsome suites, with mod furnishings, are perfect for curling up in when the rain lashes the wild surf. In fair weather, guests mingle on the oceanfront deck to watch gray whales or gaze at the stars. In the morning, a hearty breakfast with fresh pastries provides fortification for beachcombing. Nestled between two state parks, the inn offers direct access to a nearly deserted Pacific stretch with sand dollar-filled tide pools. Day 3: Arch Cape to Lincoln City . Lincoln City is a straight 79-mile shot down the 101, past open stretches of sand with more clumps of beach grass than sunbathers. Along the way: Laneda Avenue, in Manzanita, is a charming shopping strip; the Picnic Basket (503/ 355-8500), in Rockaway Beach, has 97 flavors of salt-water taffy; Garibaldi Marina (503/ 322-3312) will hook you up for crab hunting and clam digging; and the Hawk Creek CafÃ© (503/ 392-3838), in Neskowin, serves fresh seafood and a popular wood-fired pizza. Tillamook is the home of the famous cheddar, as well as ice creams made from local berries. Past Lincoln City, in Newport, is a worthwhile detour: the Yaquina Bay Lighthouse, dating from 1871. The beachfront at Lincoln City is stacked with condo-by-the-sea complexes which makes the recent renovation of the 141-room Surftides (doubles from $134) that much more welcome. Under the new management of the owners of the hip Farmer's Daughter hotel, in Los Angeles, the Surftides -- first opened in 1936 -- is now decorated with cork bulletin-board walls and jazzy striped daybeds. The balconied guest rooms reference Midcentury Modern design with sleek built-ins and bold orange accents. You'd swear you were sleeping in an urban boutique hotel, except the roar outside your door is waves, not traffic. Planning a beach getaway?

"(Southern Living) -- Just a minute ago I was sailing down a Texas Panhandle highway, level as a tabletop. Then I dropped off the face of the High Plains into the heart of a wild place called Caprock Canyons. It's the rough-and-tumble centerpiece of a 15,000-acre state park, 100 miles southeast of Amarillo. Caprock Canyons is about 100 miles southeast of Amarillo. If you hanker to break away from the herd, you ought to see it in the quiet of an early morning when shades of red and yellow streak canyon walls like melted sunshine and you can hear the haunting bellow of bison bulls grazing in the grass. Off the beaten path . Hidden in the midst of sprawling ranches, Caprock Canyons doesn't lure as many visitors as its famous neighbor, Palo Duro Canyon (93 miles northwest). That's the way C.L. Hawkins, caretaker for the official Texas bison herd, likes it. It means you can still find quiet times to catch a vision of the land not greatly changed from the way it was when millions of bison roamed the High Plains and wintered in hidden canyons. When you look at these mighty creatures in the state herd, you're seeing the direct descendants of wild bison once ""as numerous as grains on the seashore,"" according to one traveler's report. SouthernLiving.com: Wide open in West Texas . You can see the bison from viewing platforms and through telescopes at an overlook near the new visitors center, but Hawkins keeps them separated from people for safety. ""You don't push bison,"" he says. ""You work them on their own terms. I still consider them wild animals."" SouthernLiving.com: Climbing in West Texas . Hit the trail . There are many ways to explore the scenic canyon -- hiking, mountain biking, on horseback, or by car on a 5-mile loop. Even on the drive, you get a close-up look at multicolored sandstone cliffs and rugged arroyos carved by tributaries of the Red River. The long narrow Caprock Escarpment stands as high as 1,000 feet in places. Coronado passed this way. So did roving Comanche bands and prehistoric canyon dwellers as long as 12,000 years ago. Tomas Hinojosa, owner of Quitaque Riding Stables ([806] 269-1209 or [806] 455-1208; rides start at $35 per hour) in the nearby town of Quitaque (pronounced ""kitty-quay"") follows in the footsteps of explorers when he takes riders out to sections of the 64-mile-long path, which is part of Caprock Canyons State Park & Trailway. SouthernLiving.com: 40 things I love about Texas . You don't need to be experienced to ride, but if it's your first time you should start with an hour-long trip. Try to schedule it for early morning. ""That's when we see most of the wildlife,"" Hinojosa points out. Whether you explore it from the saddle or behind a steering wheel, it's a piece of untamed Texas you won't see anywhere else.

"(EW.com) -- Lifetime will put John Walsh back to work: The network announced today that it has picked up ""America's Most Wanted."" The show that began its run on the Fox owned and operated stations and then moved to the network will return for its 25th season later this year on Lifetime. (In May, Fox canceled the show as a weekly Saturday series because the show was no longer profitable but it will still air quarterly specials -- the first of which will bow in October.) ""I've always believed there was something very special about ""America's Most Wanted"" and that there should be a home for it on television, and I couldn't be happier to now be able bring it back on Lifetime,"" said Walsh in a statement.

"(CNN) -- The 54 men and 14 boys rescued after being found chained this week at an Islamic religious school in Pakistan have been reunited with their families or placed in shelters, authorities said. The group was discovered in an underground room with heavy chains linking them together. The school, Al-Arabiya Aloom Jamia Masjid Zikirya, which also was a drug rehab clinic, is in Sohrab Goth, a suburb of Gadap in Karachi. All 14 boys were returned to their families, senior police official Ahsanullah Marwat told CNN. Of the adults, 47 had been released to their families, and seven were handed over to a shelter for the homeless, he said. Three people who worked at the facility were arrested, but the four men who ran the place were still at large, Marwat said. Officials said the facility was part madrassa and part drug-rehab facility, and the captives were chained at night apparently to prevent their escape. ""The operation was successful, and we plan on continuing our work to ensure that places like this are shut down,"" Marwat said. Many of the captives told police their families sent them there because they were recovering drug addicts. During the day, they worked and did religious studies. But the future of the rescued children was unclear. One woman told a local television station that she was willing to pay the police to keep her troublesome child. She said she would rather have the facility remain open, regardless of how it treated the children. Many others, however, said they were in shock and disbelief over the allegations. One man complained he was deep in debt after paying the school a large amount of money to board his son.","Captive boys and men were rescued from an Islamic religious school in Pakistan .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It was an odd collection of vehicles on display on Capitol Hill, ranging from a bucket truck used for repairing power lines to something resembling an enclosed golf cart to a pair of hot-looking, two-seater sports cars. Lawmakers eyeball one of several alternative-energy vehicles parked this week on Capitol Hill. What they had in common was alternative energy: The cars run on electricity and biofuels as well as gasoline. Tuesday's display attracted some U.S. senators who couldn't resist taking the vehicles for a spin. ""I'm about to have claustrophobia!"" laughed Sen. Thomas Carper, D-Delaware, as he folded himself into a yellow, low-slung vehicle known by the initials ENVI, developed by the Chrysler Corporation. ""Evan Bayh [Democratic senator from Indiana] and I were talking about taking a road trip in the van down there,"" said Carper, pointing to a nearby offering from General Motors. ""That's probably better for a road trip than this!"" Carper then spotted Democratic colleague Tom Harkin, and joked that the sports car might draw too much attention in the Iowa senator's corn country. Undeterred, Harkin climbed in next and asked to take a test drive. But instead of starting with a growling engine and a roar of exhaust, the little yellow coupe simply rolled quietly out of its parking space. It is an electric vehicle. The display, titled ""The Energy and Environmental Showcase,"" was intended to demonstrate for lawmakers actual production models of vehicles that may cut the nation's reliance on petroleum-based fuels. An unusual aspect of the show was that traditional Detroit nameplates such as General Motors sat next to competitors from other countries. The event was organized by Bright Automotive, a small carmaker from Anderson, Indiana, to showcase its IDEA, a new, 100-mpg plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that it hopes to market for government and commercial fleets. In a statement, the company said it has applied for funding through the federal Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. Other manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to bring their own vehicles to the public display, in a parking lot near the Russell Senate Office Building. During the Bush administration, Japanese automakers complained they weren't invited to a similar demonstration near the Treasury Department, despite having brought their alternative-energy cars more swiftly to the U.S. market than the Detroit automakers. But neither the competition nor the threat of bankruptcy held back the enthusiasm of a General Motors product spokesman at Tuesday's display. ""If anything, it's just a little bit of noise in the background,"" said Tony Posawatz, a GM vehicle line director. He told CNN the automaker places high on its recovery agenda the line of Volt electric cars expected to come to market by November 2010. A silver GM sedan on display nearby uses electric batteries and a self-contained recharging engine powered by a variety of fuels. ""I would like people to stop talking mpg,"" Posawatz said, leading a reporter toward a van powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The Chevy Equinox on display is one of 100 now in private hands. Instead of miles per gallon, the energy plant supplies electricity and a calculation of cruising range while driving. For now, however, drivers might still be impressed by the ZENN, a little car claiming 280 miles per gallon. The car's cruising range of about 40 miles translates to about 280 miles per gallon, according to the Canadian automaker. ""ZENN"" stands for Zero Emission No Noise, said a worker who was buffing away some tree pollen that had settled on the car during the breezy afternoon. The car's top speed is about that of a strong gust of wind -- 35 mph. ""It's supposed to be your third car in the driveway,"" explained ZENN spokesman Daniel Stiller. ""Most people drive less than 20 miles from home on streets with speed limits of 35 miles per hour or less."" He acknowledged that the car may qualify as street-legal only on local, low-speed roads. But Stiller said the ZENN is a dramatic improvement in both safety and driveability, compared with the golf carts often seen around retirement communities. Among the other alternative energy vehicles on display were cars from Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Honda and the Smart car company. Another brand shown to lawmakers is named after Nikola Tesla, an inventor who helped develop the practical use of electricity a century ago. Tesla's system of alternating current eventually displaced Thomas Edison's use of direct current in the nation's early power grid. The red, two-seater electric sports car on display might have been a good fit for Tesla, a lifelong bachelor. Carper, the Delaware senator, suggested the two sports cars were classic ""chick magnets."" Tesla spokesman Joe Powers told CNN his company now has about 400 of the sleek, aerodynamic cars in private hands. ""We've created a viable car, and we came out with this model first to help draw attention to the Tesla brand,"" he said. The California-based company also is developing a a sedan that will use the same advanced battery technology as the sports car, which costs about $109,000. ""It will be the kind of car you can take on a trip, and carry four passengers and their luggage,"" Powers said. It uses 7,000 lithium-ion cells of the same chemistry now powering cell phones and laptop computers. ""We are working on a battery exchange program that will cut the cost of these vehicles by about $35,000,"" Powers said, describing a leasing program where owners can swap a used-up battery back for a new one. Most of the vehicles on display qualify for a new $7,500 federal rebate intended to encourage car buyers to consider alternative-energy vehicles. Perhaps the vehicle that caused the most double-takes Tuesday was a bucket truck from the local electric utility company serving the Washington, D.C., area. The Pepco vehicle, the kind seen repairing downed power lines, runs on biofuels that range from discarded cooking grease to soybean oil. The truck was apparently not for sale, and there were no representatives nearby to answer questions.","An eclectic assortment of alternative-energy vehicles hit Capitol Hill this week .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Democratic-controlled Senate on Wednesday rejected two proposed versions for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution -- a setback to GOP leaders and conservative activists who say the measure is necessary to end the federal government's spiraling deficit spending. A Democratic version opposed by Republicans fell on a 21-79 vote. Then a Republican version also failed to get the two-thirds majority required with a 47-53 vote. Last month, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed to pass a GOP-proposed amendment, falling 23 votes shy of the two-thirds majority required for passage. The congressional votes on the amendment were agreed to by both parties in August as part of the agreement raising Washington's debt ceiling. Democratic leaders, however, are vehemently opposed to the idea, arguing that it would force the government into an economically destructive cycle of massive spending cuts. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said Wednesday that a step as historically significant as a constitutional amendment was unnecessary. Getting government spending under control ""takes political will, even political courage,"" Durbin said, but ""it doesn't take a constitutional amendment.'' Conservative Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah disagreed, saying Congress has repeatedly proved it's unable to control itself on spending. ""We are taxing and spending this country into bankruptcy,"" Hatch said, later adding, ""We don't have any restraint around here."" Despite the proposal's defeat, it has been favored by the public. Nearly three in four Americans favored passage of the amendment in a July 18-20 CNN/ORC International Poll, while 24% were opposed. Sixty percent of Americans say they believe a balanced budget amendment is necessary to get the deficit under control, according to the poll. The House passed a balanced budget amendment in 1995, but the measure fell one vote short in the Senate in both 1995 and 1997.","Two versions fail to get the two-thirds majority required .

"(CNN) -- Since 2001, there have been many excellent, award-winning and ground-breaking films, both narrative and documentary, about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""The Hurt Locker,"" ""Taxi to the Dark Side,"" ""Control Room,"" ""Occupation: Dreamland,"" ""Gunner Palace,"" ""Why We Fight,"" ""Body of War,"" ""Ghosts of Abu Ghraib,"" ""No End in Sight,"" ""Restrepo,"" ""The Prisoner: Or How I Planned To Kill Tony Blair,"" ""Stop-Loss"" and so on. All of these films have their place. Many are exceptional, moving and award-winning pieces of work, but of those that I have seen, none pack the visceral, emotional and artistic wallop that Danfung Dennis' documentary ""Hell and Back Again"" delivers, and all without any politics whatsoever. There's nothing, not one word of whether the United States should be fighting these wars, why we're there or who's to blame. This is an intimate film about then-25-year-old Marine Sgt. Nathan Harris, his wife (and high school sweetheart) Ashley and the personal cost of war. It is also an astonishing technical achievement in war journalism and documentary filmmaking that may very possibly change the way conflicts are reported forever. Dennis designed and built a customized Steadicam rig (a device that enables a filmmaker to move over an uneven surface without the camera bouncing up and down), allowing him to shoot footage that looks ""Hollywood,"" but was shot with a ""prosumer"" Canon 5D Mark II digital SLR: Basically a still camera that shoots HD video. Along with a customized sound rig, Dennis was able to shoot intimate war footage that until now has been impossible. The combat footage is, however, only part of the story. Six months into his third tour of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, and just days from rotating out, Harris (Echo Company, 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment) is gravely wounded during a Taliban ambush. His hip and leg are broken, and blood transfusions and multiple surgeries are required to save his life. Dennis was embedded with Echo Company when it was dropped deep behind enemy lines, and as an embedded reporter, he did his job, filming the troops in combat and interacting with Afghan locals. During his time with the troops, Dennis got to know Harris, and after he was wounded, Dennis rejoined him in North Carolina and continued filming there. As the film moves back and forth between Afghanistan and North Carolina, where Nathan is undergoing rehab for his injuries, it becomes painfully clear that the hell of war doesn't end when troops return home. And after watching the film, it's unclear whether the ""hell"" of the title is Afghanistan or back home. Harris' injuries are horrific, and he's on multiple medications. In an early scene, his wife is driving the pair on a shopping trip and he's going through his meds (OxyContin, Dilaudid, etc.). It's a pharmacy of addictive painkillers. Later in the film, one of Harris' doctors explains the process of weaning him off the drugs, including withdrawal and the risk of dependency. It's clear that Harris doesn't want to have to use the drugs forever, as he continuously complains of being nauseated and out of it, but he is also is just as clearly becoming dependent on them. In Afghanistan, life is chaotic and dangerous and terrifying, but it is also, on one level, very simple. Troops are there to do one main thing: kill bad guys. (An early shot of a Marine instructor telling his charges that they are ""experts in the application of violence"" is chilling.) However, once a Marine returns home, the frustrations of everyday life can be crippling. For example, looking for a space in a crowded mall parking lot can be irritating enough as an everyday experience, but to a Marine recently returned from a war zone, this and many other mundane annoyances can be extremely frustrating, trivial and ultimately useless. Add to that a body full of pain and medications, and you have the makings of a difficult re-entry into life on the home front. With injuries as severe as Harris', it's virtually impossible to avoid getting hooked on pain pills. Not only does the injury cause pain, but the brutal physical therapy that is needed to regain maximum usage of his leg is excruciating. The differences between the strong, vigorous and professional leader in Afghanistan and the severely injured, angry, depressed, dependent and occasionally almost childlike man at home is shocking. One chilling scene involves Harris relating his mindset when he first joined the Marines: ""All I wanted to do was kill people."" He was told by the recruiters that was the best answer they'd heard. He says he no longer thinks that way, but it's clear that the Marines and the wars have had a serious effect on his psyche, as he is rarely seen in the film without a handgun, nervously loading and unloading it, pretending to play Russian roulette and even sleeping with it, loaded, under his mattress. An additional casualty of the war is his wife, Ashley. Portrayed as loyal and loving, it's clear that at times, she is scared for, and occasionally of, her husband. War and his injuries have changed him, and in one unsettling scene, she recounts how there are times when Harris basically becomes a different person. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of the start of the war in Afghanistan, and if this film does anything, it reminds us that the cost of war extends far beyond those who die in battle. The returning troops and those to whom they return are also casualties, and they deserve our care and attention. ""Hell and Back Again"" opened in New York on Wednesday and rolls out in major cities across the country over the coming weeks. Check the movie's website for the release schedule. The film is rated R. As one would expect, it contains a fair amount of off-color language as well as some brutal imagery.

"(Budget Travel) -- Just a two-hour detour from Paris, the Loire was once a playground to Renaissance royals. Now its vaunted chÃ¢teaux are attracting enterprising young couples and artists who have remade them into captivating -- and surprisingly affordable -- inns. Surrounded by 10-foot-high limestone walls, Le Clos d'Amboise offers an unexpected sanctuary in the town of Amboise. CHINON . HÃ´tel Diderot . ""If you've never eaten a brioche with fresh Ste. Maure goat cheese, honey and walnuts for breakfast, then you haven't been to the Loire,"" says Laurent Dutheil, who is justifiably proud of the simple breakfasts he serves at his 23-room hotel in the western corner of the valley. Dutheil also produces dozens of fragrant artisanal jams such as apple-lavender and quince-cinnamon. (Sadly, they aren't for sale, but you can buy Dutheil's recipe book, ""Jam in the Cupboard."") The traditional foods fit well with the hotel's venerable atmosphere: Diderot is housed in a sprawling 15th-century home that the Chinon-born Dutheil, along with his two sisters, Martine and Francoise, bought and renovated six years ago. Budget Travel: See the hotels . Dutheil tackled structural issues, taking care to keep the exposed oak beams and original stone walls intact, while his sisters refurbished the rooms with cheerful striped wallpaper, toile bedding, and 19th-century armoires they scavenged on trips to Paris. The largest room, which sleeps four, has double windows with views of a courtyard. In the distance lie vineyards full of the red Chinon grapes much loved by 16th-century novelist and satirist FranÃ§ois Rabelais. 4 rue de Buffon, 011-33/2-47-93-18-87, hoteldiderot.com, rooms from $72. THÃSÃE . Le Moulin de la Renne . A tunnel of towering fir trees leads to the entrance of this converted 19th-century mill in ThÃ©sÃ©e, on the banks of the Cher River. Guests are greeted by an enormous Bernese mountain dog named Alpha and his equally friendly owners, VÃ©ronique and Christophe Villanfin. There are 13 guest rooms, decorated with items such as embroidered quilts and framed puzzles of boats assembled by jigsaw fanatic VÃ©ronique. Jazz enthusiasts, the Villanfins host occasional concerts featuring local groups, including Les Bras'Coeurs, a quartet that performs Georges Brassens standards. The soirees are held in the restaurant, known locally for its coq au vin: rooster stewed in cabernet bottled at Le Chai des Varennes winery next door. 11 route de Vierzon, 011-33/2-54-71-41-56, moulindelarenne.com, closed Jan. 10--Feb. 10 and 10 days in Nov., rooms from $76, entrÃ©es from $15.75. CIVRAY-DE-TOURAINE . ChÃ¢teau de l'Isle . The ChÃ¢teau de l'Isle is quiet to the core -- unless you count the chorus of quacks coming from the duck pond on the 35-acre grounds. The 18th-century manor house had been abandoned for 10 years when Denis Gandon bought it in 1986 and transformed the place into a 12-room hotel. Still, the chÃ¢teau somehow feels like a private home: A portrait of Gandon's grandfather hangs over a 100-year-old antique table in the dining area, and an amiable Jack Russell terrier entertains guests with endless rounds of fetch. The stylish bedrooms have exposed wood beams and beds draped with coverlets in shades of crimson and marigold. Budget Travel: See the hotels . In the summer, breakfast is served in an expansive glassed-in terrace overlooking the garden. A nearby potager (or kitchen garden) supplies produce for some of chef Fabrice Cherioux's breakfast treats, such as a zesty tomato confiture. 1 rue de l'Ecluse, 011-33/2-47-23-63-60, chateau-de-lisle.com, rooms from $69, breakfast $13. CHENONCEAUX . La Roseraie . This 18-room hotel in Chenonceaux was a must-stay on the itineraries of political notables after World War II, when the Allies were trying to figure out how to piece Europe back together. Winston Churchill, Harry Truman and Eleanor Roosevelt all, at one time or another, laid their heads at La Roseraie. (A letter from Roosevelt still hangs in the breakfast room.) In 2000, Sophie and Laurent Fiorito acquired the property and completed a top-to-bottom renovation. There is no such thing as a standard room here -- tiny singles have just enough space for a twin bed, while one suite fits a family of five. The decor is equally varied. One room has a Louis Philippe-style dresser and a crystal chandelier; another shows off a modern pink-checkered sofa. The hotel's best asset is its proximity (a five-minute walk) to ChÃ¢teau de Chenonceau, which Henri II gave to his beloved mistress, Diane de Poitiers; the massive 16th-century building hovers over the River Cher. 7 rue du Docteur Bretonneau, 011-33/2-47-23-90-09, hotel-chenonceau.com, closed Nov.--Jan. and Mar., rooms from $85. AMBOISE . Le Clos d'Amboise . Surrounded by 10-foot-high limestone walls, in the heart of the old market center of Amboise, this 17-room mansion inn offers an unexpected sanctuary from the town's bustling, narrow streets. The bedrooms come equipped with decorative elements such as mahogany four-poster beds and original fireplaces, while the common room features wood floors modeled after those at the Palace of Versailles. Most of the rooms overlook the hotel's private park, landscaped with 100-year-old magnolias and a pine tree that survived the French Revolution. A pool by the rose garden is perfect for a cool dip after relaxing in the wood sauna, housed in a former stable. Just a 10-minute stroll from the hotel stands the riverside castle that belonged to King FranÃ§ois I -- part medieval fortress, part Renaissance royal house. The king became famously enthralled by Leonardo da Vinci during a 1515 excursion to Italy, and he set up the painter in a gabled redbrick chÃ¢teau (now a museum), just down the road from his castle. 27 rue Rabelais, 011-33/2-47-30-10-20, leclosamboise.com, closed Dec.--Jan., rooms from $98. LIMERAY . Auberge de Launay . Between the two of them, FranÃ§ois and HÃ©lÃ¨ne ThÃ©vard have honed their hospitality skills at some of the world's most well-respected hotels, including Le Meurice in Paris and the Savoy in London. After years helping manage other people's properties, the couple -- with their two small kids, Emma and Alexandre -- packed up their Paris apartment and bought an unassuming farmhouse in the secluded hamlet of Limeray to convert to a 15-room inn. ""I grew up in the region, so when we made the decision to open our own place, I knew that I had to come back to the Loire,"" says FranÃ§ois. In keeping with the spare design of the house, the decor at the Auberge is simple -- bedrooms are outfitted with neutral suede sofas, blond-wood floors and minimalist photographs of daisies and landscapes. The duo oversees the daily lunch and dinner service at the on-site restaurant, which serves local specialties such as butter-poached Loire eel and chicken with mustard cream. The house dessert, a salted-caramel fruit tart, is baked with apples picked in the hotel's orchard. Le Haut Chantier, 011-33/2-47-30-16-82, aubergedelaunay.com, closed Dec. 15--Jan. 15, rooms from $72, two-course dinner from $26. ONZAIN . ChÃ¢teau des Tertres . This mansion in the heart of the Loire once belonged to the mother of novelist Marguerite Duras (who mentions the chÃ¢teau in her famous work ""The Lover""). Later, in the 1960s, its marble hallways were filled with students from a nearby engineering school, which used the building as a dorm. In 1992, another curious owner took over management of the 14-room chÃ¢teau: Bernard Valois, an artist who kept the mansion's 19th-century detailing (high ceilings, gilded mirrors) but added contemporary design flourishes, such as a photograph of a mysterious pair of eyes in the foyer. Last year, Valois and his wife, Christine, redecorated a former gatekeeper's house as a contemporary four-room cottage with knockoff Jackson Pollock paintings and sculptures that resemble enormous eggs. ""My husband likes to turn things that seem ordinary into the extraordinary,"" Christine says. ""He designed a 'Sputnik' bidet that has Japanese robots stationed around the tank."" Valois also tends a 12-acre garden of roses and clematises, where guests can find a shed stocked with complimentary bikes for exploring the area's 186 miles of riding paths. 11 rue de Meuves, 011-33/2-54-20-83-88, chateau-tertres.com, closed Oct. 19-Apr. 1, rooms from $94. CHITENAY . Auberge du Centre . When Gilles Martinet's grandmother found herself widowed at the end of World War I, she started selling milk and eggs to make ends meet. One thing led to another, and her home eventually became a guesthouse and restaurant specializing in French country fare, like chicken sautÃ©ed in fresh cider. Three generations later, Martinet is now proprietor and chef of this inn, which has 26 brightly decorated rooms in shades of sage and rose, as well as a flower-filled garden terrace out back. He has kept the breakfast area much the way his grandmother designed it, with rustic stone walls, an ample fireplace and simple country furnishings. There are bicycles available to rent ($14.50 per day) for excursions to the ChÃ¢teau de Cheverny, about five miles away. 34 Grande Rue, 011-33/2-54-70-42-11, auberge-du-centre.com, closed Feb., rooms from $78, entrÃ©es from $17. Loire Basics . A two-hour drive southwest of Paris, the Loire Valley is known for its earthy cabernet franc wines and hundreds of majestic castles. It's impossible to see them all (a visit to one chÃ¢teau can take half a day), so it's wise to focus on the worthy ones: Chenonceau, the graceful riverine palace that once belonged to Henri II (chenonceau.com, $13); Chambord, which has a double-helix staircase inspired by the designs of Leonardo da Vinci (chambord.org, $12.50); and Cheverny, renowned for its flamboyant, gilded interiors (chateau-cheverny.com, $9.75).

"(ESSENCE)  -- As the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson wears many hats: environmentalist, upholder of anti-pollution policy and toxic chemical regulator, to name a few. Lisa Jackson wears many hats as the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency. But when she reflects on her role as the first African-American to head the agency, her aim is to make people see the connection between the environment and their lives. Jackson spoke to ESSENCE.com about school safety, asthma, environmental racism -- and what she's doing to battle all three. The following is an edited version of that interview: . ESSENCE.COM: You've said that your overarching goal is to return the EPA to its roots, to serve the American people and show that your work involves issues that they care about. Can you give us some examples on how you plan to achieve that?   Watch powerful women and grieving mothers Â» . Lisa Jackson: The example that probably best epitomizes it is what we're doing on air toxin's in schools. USA Today did a front-page story saying they'd done some risk assessments, and think schools across the country have high level of toxins in the air around them. The American people are rightfully worried, thinking, 'So now you're telling me that when I put my child on a school bus, I have to worry about them once they're there?' We're in the middle of a 60-site monitoring effort with states to get air toxins information from the schools that are among the worst -- schools near highways with cars, buses and trucks, or schools that might be near factories. We want to try to get a handle on this, not to comfort people, but to get them answers. ESSENCE: Lisa Jackson brings change to EPA . ESSENCE.COM: You've also spoken about elevated asthma rates in communities of color. What can the EPA do to improve air quality when minority neighborhoods are already so congested? Jackson: You have to think about the big actions that we do. We know that one of the main triggers is high ozone levels. You can't attack that in one area; that's a global problem. What the EPA has to do is ratchet down on emissions from cars, trucks, factories and manufacturing processes that produce ozone. That's regulatory work -- setting permit levels low enough and making sure there's enforcement so that people abide by those levels. EPA has also proposed a monitoring network near major transportation arteries to better understand the pollution that's happening in the communities that are located next to them. ESSENCE: Will the new green jobs go to black people? ESSENCE.COM: Understanding that the EPA doesn't necessarily focus on the location of every bus depot or landfill in the country, it's still a big problem. The decisions to locate polluting sites in minority neighborhoods are usually made by people who don't live in them. Since their voices are so often not at the table, how can EPA regulate how those decisions are made, to break the cycle? Jackson: That's what the environmental justice movement has been saying for a long time, that there ought to be some screen that you can use in permitting decisions to say, ""Are we talking about a place that's already disproportionately impacted? And, if so, don't add to that pollution."" I think that is the policy challenge of our time. It's all about public participation to me. As you said, the decision is made not by the people who have to suffer the consequences of it. ESSENCE: Give back like your favorite celebs . People should be able to advocate and say, ""Okay, you can put that here, but we want to make sure that the level of contamination coming from the stack is something that's acceptable, and that we believe is safe for our community."" That's a big difference. ESSENCE.COM: So, how do you educate them about this? What does EPA outreach to minority communities look like? Jackson: I think it looks like the kind of outreach we're doing in general. We do it through enforcement, looking across a state and saying, ""Before you make a citing decision, you have to get adequate public comment that it meets clean air standards."" The other side of it is that we have grassroots groups out there who organize against additional pollution. But we still haven't plugged in. We still don't feel that EPA is an accessible enough organization. I can play a role in that because communities feel more at home coming to us when they know there's an African-American woman at the head, and that she's making a real effort. They can trust that, when they bring their issues to the table, I'm not going to sweep them under the rug. In our regional offices, there's a real emphasis now that one of our priorities is environmental justice, and making sure that disproportionately impacted communities -- low-income populations and communities of color -- feel at home bringing their issues to us and know that they have a voice.","Lisa Jackson is first African-American to head Environmental Protection Agency .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Following an investigation, Israel apologized to Egypt this week over an August incident in which five Egyptian border guards were killed, the Israeli Ministry of Defense said. The apology, issued Tuesday, was overshadowed by news that a deal had been reached for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was captured by the Palestinian group Hamas more than five years ago. However, it was largely seen as an olive branch to the transitional Egyptian government, as relations between Israel and Egypt have become strained in recent months. On August 18, militants crossed into Israel from Egyptian territory to attack Israeli civilian targets. Eight Israeli citizens were killed in the attacks, which Israel has said were the work of a jihadist group based in Gaza. Responding to the attacks, Israeli troops killed five Egyptian border guards while in pursuit of the militants. The investigation into the incident was conducted by senior Israel Defense Forces officials and Egyptian army officials, the Ministry of Defense said. For security reasons, the ministry said, the results of the probe remain sealed. Israel issued a rare statement of regret three days after the incident, after Egypt suggested it was recalling its ambassador in protest. The overture, however, was deemed insufficient by many in Egypt and days later, angry protesters ransacked the Israeli Embassy in Cairo. The entire staff was hastily withdrawn after U.S. President Barack Obama personally intervened with the Egyptians to secure their safe passage, but the sequence of events dealt a blow to Israeli-Egyptian relations. In the wake of the embassy incident, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would stick to its 1979 peace agreement with Egypt. In the Tuesday statement, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the August militant attack was ""despicable"" and ""meant to murder as many Israeli citizens as possible and destroy the peaceful relations that are strategically important between Israel and Egypt,"" the Tuesday statement said. But ""based on the findings of the investigation, the defense minister decided to express his apology to Egypt over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire."" Netanyahu, meanwhile, spoke Thursday with the head of Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi and thanked him for the ""central role"" Egypt played in the agreement for Shalit's return, the prime minister's office said. ""Your assistance warms the cockles of the heart of all Israeli citizens,"" Netanyahu told Tantawi.","NEW: Netanyahu thanks Egyptian field marshal for assistance with deal for Shalit's return .

"(CNN) -- Major league catcher Wilson Ramos has been ""found alive,"" two days after he was reported kidnapped by gunmen, Venezuelan state TV reported Friday. Ramos was found by security forces in Montalban, a mountainous region about 60 miles from the north central Venezuelan town where he was last seen, according to a tweet posted late Friday by Communications Minister Andres Izarra. Ramos was reported by state-run VTV to be healthy and unharmed. Ramos, a rising star for the Washington Nationals as a rookie this past year, had returned to his native country to play in Venezuela's winter league. But before his first game with the Aragua Tigers, gunmen kidnapped him Wednesday night from his mother's home in Santa Ines in Carabobo state, a team spokeswoman said. On Thursday, authorities said that they had found the SUV they believe was used in the kidnapping and had created sketches of two of the gunmen. Prior to his release Friday, news about the federal investigation was tightly guarded. ""It's understandable that everyone wants to know what is happening with Wilson and how the investigation goes, but remember that, in these cases, patience is key,"" Tigers spokeswoman Kathe Vilera said on her Twitter account. She added that keeping the details sealed could help the investigation. ""It has all the earmarks as a targeted kidnapping: selected victim, selected location, selected time,"" said Chris Voss, a kidnapping specialist for Insite Security who has handled six cases involving Venezuela and who worked for the FBI for 26 years. ""There's an outside possibility that they thought they were grabbing another member of the family, but that's extremely unlikely."" Kidnapping as an industry has crossed the border from Colombia into Venezuela, Voss said. ""When criminals next door show you a model of how to make money easily -- and kidnapping is usually pretty easy money -- then other kidnappers will simply ape it."" But targeting athletes and other celebrities can be a mistake, he said. ""It's going to bring too much law enforcement scrutiny down on them; too much international scrutiny. And media attention and scrutiny from law enforcement worldwide is bad for business."" Ramos, 24, emerged as the Nationals' top catcher this past season. He had a .267 batting average with 15 home runs and 52 runs batted in. Though soccer reigns in most Latin American countries, it is baseball that rules in Venezuela, which routinely feeds players to major league teams in the United States. That pipeline has been transformed in recent years because of violence. As Venezuela's economy has stagnated in recent years, crimes such as kidnapping and murder have risen. According to the National Institute of Statistics, 16,917 people were kidnapped between July 2008 and July 2010, or about 23 kidnappings a day. Baseball players who play professionally in the United States, whether in the major or minor leagues, are typically targeted for their money, though Ramos' case is the first time a player himself has been snatched. Usually, a family member is held for ransom. ""Government, please do something because Venezuela is crumbling with so much insecurity while you say that Venezuela is safe,"" Venezuelan baseball player Jose Castillo wrote on his Twitter account. Melvin Dorta, a Venezuelan playing professionally in the U.S. Atlantic Independent League, told CNN that there are lots of opportunities in Venezuela, but also pitfalls. Dorta has played for the Aragua Tigers and is a friend and former teammate of Ramos. ""Venezuela does have one of the best winter leagues, but it is one of the leagues where the Americans ask before going because of the insecurity and the dangers that one faces,"" he said. Those dangers have led many American teams to abandon their baseball academies in Venezuela, said Arturo Marcano, a lawyer and sports columnist who co-authored a book about the recruitment of players from Venezuela. When major league teams noticed the talent sitting in places like the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, they increased their investment in the region. Instead of relying on scouts to find players, they instituted the academies to find, train and sign players, Marcano said. ""The goal is to identify the players and sign the players, and if you can do it as cheaply as possible, all the better,"" he told CNN. As crime in Venezuela increased, however, operating the academies became dangerous for their managers and scouts. ""All of a sudden, with these safety issues, teams started to leave,"" Marcano said. At its peak, about 16 major league teams operated baseball academies in Venezuela, he said. Today, that number is only five or six. Teams have returned to the practice of sending only scouts, and then sending promising players to academies in the Dominican Republic. Venezuelans who make it to the big leagues in the United States and return home become targets because there is a perception that they all make a lot of money, Marcano said. But for the minor leaguers and nonsuperstars in their first major league years, that is not necessarily the case. Another aspect that may have influenced the Ramos kidnapping is that players from humble backgrounds who make money in the pros often return to the rough neighborhoods where their families live. Working-class families often don't want to leave their neighborhoods and their friends; they may feel they don't belong in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods. For example, Ramos was kidnapped from the home of his relatives, who had stayed in a tough area despite his success.","NEW: Ramos is healthy and unharmed, state-run VTV reports .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- November 28th last year passed pretty quietly here. But in some ways it was more significant a date than today. That was when, by my calculations, U.S.-led coalition troops had been in Afghanistan longer than the Soviet Union was. Today, they've been here 10 years. That's almost impossible to contemplate. The time has drifted by, measured more in sacrifice and expenditure: The numbers of young soldiers who risked a lot to join the military and won't be going home. The immeasurable amount of money spent here, on roads that will be hard to maintain once the coalition leaves, on homes in Dubai for Afghan officials who should have known better. Cruder calculations suggest the money spent on war each month here could alternatively be given straight to Afghans -- hundreds of dollars each a month. That would have been something in 2001, but now the huge inflation of war makes it comparative small change. General Stanley McChrystal, the former top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said Thursday the coalition is only 50 per cent of the way there. It is likely McChrystal, who lost his job after he and his team were quoted extensively in Rolling Stone magazine, will be remembered as the great truth-teller of the war that ended his military career. For a little while, his bluntly pessimistic assessments felt like there was someone in charge who knew how bad and how complicated it was, and how long the road ahead would be. As one of McChrystal's top aides, Maj. Gen Bill Mayville, told Rolling Stone in that same article: ""It's not going to look like a win, smell like a win or taste like a win."" But after McChrystal's hasty departure, the war seemed to revert to crisis management again. His replacement as commander of U.S. and ISAF troops in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus had little time in the job before the collapse in domestic support -- dare I even say comprehension -- of the war led Obama to begin thinking about the exit. It has been curious to see Obama, the presidential candidate who seemed to understand the importance of leaving this country in a manageable state, become the drum beater for an exit. The war is not a vote-winner after Bin Laden's death, and there's simply no money left in the kitty. Some things are better: there's money everywhere here; there's better healthcare in some places; there's technology the Taliban held at bay; there are hospitals and schools where before there were none. But it's not a proper democracy; it's not safe; the vast majority of people here are still poor and illiterate; and it's still got the Taliban, al Qaeda and a lot of narco-traffickers in play. Now the timetable is set, the battle of perception, as NATO called it, being fought with one unmistakable backdrop: The Americans want out. The NATO message is being persistently and deftly put out there: We are making security good enough for the Afghans to handle. You hear that message, come hell or high water, almost independent of what's happening on the ground. It's easy to understand why: It may be there's not much more America can do here, bar stay another 10 years.","U.S.-led coalition troops have been in Afghanistan longer than the Soviet Union was .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's 77-year-old emperor was hospitalized on Sunday, several days after coming down with a fever, a spokesperson with the Imperial Household Agency said. Emperor Akihito, a ceremonial but revered figure in the Japan, was suffering from a worsening case of bronchitis and the fever he contracted Thursday, according to the spokesperson, who declined to be identified due to the agency's media protocol. ""He appears to be fatigued and has lost some resistance to fight against sickness,"" the spokesperson said. ""To be on the safe side, he was hospitalized (Sunday night) at University of Tokyo Hospital."" It is the emperor's second time in a hospital this year, after getting medical treatment in February for extensive tests of his coronary arteries. Japan's Cabinet on Sunday approved a measure to temporarily elevate Crown Prince Naruhito to the role of emperor and give him power over all the responsibilities that position entails, according to a person at the Cabinet office, who also was not named per policy. Akihito: The 125th Emperor of Japan . Born in Tokyo in December 1933 into a family that eventually consisted of seven children, Akihito became crown prince in 1952 -- the same year he enrolled at Gakushuin University, according to his official biography. Seven years later, he married then-crown princess, and now Empress Michiko, and together they raised three children. On January 7, 1989, following the death of his father Hirohito, Akihito became emperor. The position, per Japan's constitution, is defined as ""the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people."" That said, the office's involvement in day-to-day government affairs tends to be minimal. Yet Emperor Akihito broke from precedent following Japan's epic 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami earlier this year, when he gave a historic, televised speech. In it, he encouraged citizens to put forth their ""best effort to save all suffering people"" and he applauded his countrymen's handling of the crisis. ""I truly hope the victims of the disaster never give up hope, take care of themselves, and live strong for tomorrow,"" he said in a calm and poignant oration delivered from the Imperial Palace. ""Also, I want all citizens of Japan to remember everyone who has been affected by the devastation, not only today but for a long time afterwards -- and help with the recovery.""","Emperor Akihito, 77, came down with a fever Thursday, an imperial spokesperson says .

"(CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales has put the brakes on a controversial road project through a national park in the Amazon rainforest where indigenous communities live. ""The road project in the indigenous park ... is suspended,"" Morales announced Monday, after 41 days of sometimes violent protests. Before the project can proceed, it will have to pass a referendum in Cochabamba and Beni provinces, where the road would be located, according to the president. The announcement came as Morales condemned weekend violence between police and an indigenous group protesting the construction. ""We ... do not share the use of violence and the abuse toward the indigenous brothers who were on the march,"" the president said. Some indigenous leaders said a baby was killed, but Morales said there was no evidence to support the claim. ""We do not know of the death of a baby or child; I hope it did not happen,"" the president. said. But Jose Ortiz, leader of the Indigenous from northern La Paz, said ""this attack ... will stay in the memory of all Bolivians. ... We are outraged."" Hundreds of people gathered Monday in the capital, La Paz, to denounce the violence, chanting ""killers, killers, killers"" to police.

"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (CNN) -- Army Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs has been sentenced to life in military prison with eligibility for parole in 10 years. A military court-martial Thursday found Gibbs guilty of murdering three Afghan civilians, illegally cutting off pieces of their corpses to keep as ""souvenirs"" and planting weapons to make the men appear as if they were Taliban fighters killed in legitimate firefights. He was reduced in rank to private and ordered to forfeit all pay and benefits. Whatever sentence Gibbs serves will be reduced by the 547 days he has already spent in prison. ""He said they were all dirty savages,"" prosecutor Maj. Andre Leblanc said at Gibbs' sentencing hearing. ""He is the savage, not the innocent Afghans he murdered. It is monstrous. What kind of savagery does it take to do this? To cut a finger off a victim and show it to people? This is a savage being"" Gibbs' attorney, Phillip Stackhouse, had asked the court for a sentence of life with parole so Gibbs would have the opportunity to be with his now-3-year-old son again. ""He has a long time to reflect on his life, what he has done and what he wants to do in the future,"" Stackhouse said. Gibbs is the highest ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue ""kill squad"" that targeted civilians. Another seven soldiers also were charged with lesser crimes including abusing drugs, keeping ""off the books"" weapons and intimidating a fellow soldier not to speak out against the platoon's alleged killings. Gibbs had pleaded not guilty. A prosecutor described Gibbs as a ""recruiting poster"" soldier. But the tall, clean-cut Gibbs and the ""kill squad"" he was convicted of leading turned into a public-relations nightmare for the military. ""Sgt. Gibbs had a charisma, he had a 'follow me' personality,"" Maj. Robert Stelle, a prosecutor in the case, told the court in closing arguments Wednesday. ""But it was all a bunch of crap, he had his own mission: murder and depravity."" The murders Gibbs is accused of committing took place over a period of five months last year, while Gibbs led the 3rd Platoon of the ArmyÃÂ¹s 5th Stryker Brigade in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. Gibbs' platoon was tasked with patrolling small villages in the area to build relationships with an Afghan population wary of the U.S. presence in their country. Instead, prosecutors said Gibbs and a small group of rogue soldiers allegedly plotted to murder civilians and then planted weapons on them so they appeared to be Taliban attackers. ""Selling a fake engagement as a real engagement, that's what they were doing,"" Stelle told the court. In court testimony, Gibbs said he did not execute anyone. Prosecutors said Gibbs participated in the killings of three unarmed civilians: two farmers and a village cleric. Gibbs said he killed one of the men, but he claimed it was in self-defense. However, the staff sergeant admitted to ripping and cutting off fingers of all three men he was charged with killing. He kept the body parts, he said, to give to soldiers he favored or to intimidate soldiers he disliked. ""I was numb to the situation,"" Gibbs told the court about why he had taken the body parts. ""I wasn't thinking; it's sickening. I am embarrassed."" Gibbs also admitted to posing for photos with bodies against military regulations. ""People wanted to prove they were there,"" Gibbs replied when asked by his attorney why the soldiers took the photos. The Army later apologized after the photos were leaked to the press. Gibbs appeared shocked after the verdict was read, and his wife, Army Spec. Chelsy Gibbs, began to cry. According to court records, she filed for divorce from Staff Sgt. Gibbs in August and asked for custody of their toddler son. The panel of three officers and two enlisted soldiers started deliberating in a military courtroom near Tacoma shortly before 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) and returned its verdict around 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET). Phillip Stackhouse, Gibbs' defense attorney, had argued other soldiers were framing his client. Three soldiers pleaded guilty to the killings and agreed to testify against Gibbs as part of plea deals. ""What if there is no hard evidence other than what you have heard from that witness stand?"" Stackhouse said Wednesday. Some witnesses also admitted to smoking hashish they obtained from Afghan translators. Their testimony, Stackhouse said, ""came under a cloud of hash."" Stackhouse argued Gibbs wasn't where other witnesses said he was during the engagements. And, according to Stackhouse, in February 2010 Gibbs couldn't have smuggled an AK-47 in his backpack into a village where prosecutors said he then planted the assault rifle on the body of an Afghan man he had killed. Grasping an AK-47, Stackhouse showed the rifle would not fully fit into a soldier's backpack. Prosecutors countered that Gibbs had used a model of the rifle that has a shorter muzzle and could be concealed. Gibbs remains under investigation for the 2004 shooting death of a family in Iraq during his tour there, Army spokesman Maj. Chris Ophardt told CNN Thursday. The investigation into the family's killing had been closed but was reopened after Gibbs was charged with the murders of civilians in Afghanistan. During testimony last week, Gibbs said he shot at a car that failed to stop at a checkpoint in Iraq that he was manning. Inside the bullet-riddled car, Gibbs testified, were not combatants but an unarmed Iraqi family. Gibbs admitted in court that he told his troops in Afghanistan about the Iraq shooting as an example that soldiers would not face consequences for acting aggressively, even if civilians were hurt. ""If they are put in a tight situation, don't not pull the trigger,"" Gibbs said he advised members of his platoon in Afghanistan. ""You won't go to jail for it.""","Staff Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan was released from jail early Monday morning, just hours after she was booked in, authorities said. Lohan, 25, checked herself into the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood, California, at 8:48 p.m. Sunday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said on its website. By 3:10 a.m. Monday, Lohan had been released, Sheriff's Deputy Mark Pope said. Last week, a Los Angeles County judge ordered Lohan to serve a 30-day jail term after she admitted she violated her probation on a necklace theft conviction. At the time, Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said it was likely Lohan could be booked in and booked out the same day. ""It depends on the fluctuations of the day, what's going on in the jail,"" Whitmore said. The actress must work at least 12 days a month at the county morgue until she completes the 53 remaining days on her court-ordered community service, Judge Stephanie Sautner told her. Lohan must also attend 18 psychotherapy sessions. If Lohan misses any of those goals, she will be returned to jail for another 270 days, the judge ruled. ""This is what we really call putting the keys to the jail in the defendant's hands,"" Sautner told Lohan. Lohan's spokesman, Steve Honig, said Monday, ""Lindsay is very focused on fulfilling her community service obligation so she can put all of this behind her."" The actress admitted violating her probation during a hearing Wednesday. ""You are not to get house arrest or early release, except for that required by the law,"" Sautner said. Whitmore said that the early release program is part of the law, meaning Lohan would likely get out quickly due to overcrowding. Lohan did a short stint in jail last year. When Sautner sentenced Lohan to 120 days in jail last May, she ended up serving 35 days of home confinement instead, due to jail overcrowding and state rules that give prisoners credit for good behavior. It was not immediately clear how many days Lohan will actually serve this month if she ends up getting credit for good behavior. Prosecutors said Lohan missed 12 of 20 scheduled workdays at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, part of the court-ordered community service imposed in May when she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. Lohan was already on probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007. She also canceled 14 of 19 scheduled appointments for court-ordered psychotherapy, they said. ""From what I see of you, you need a structure,"" Sautner told Lohan last week. The judge instructed Lohan to return to court each month, starting December 14, to show she is complying with the schedule. If the actress stays on track, her probation would be eased on March 29, 2012, Sautner said. If she doesn't keep up with the requirements, she will serve the additional 270 days behind bars, the judge said. The full sentence imposed Wednesday was 150 days for the necklace theft probation violation and 150 days for violating probation on the 2007 drunk driving conviction in Beverly Hills. While the original sentence included 360 hours of community service at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, the judge said she did not want to put the Skid Row charity through the pain of Lohan again. When the judge called The Good Shepherd Center for Homeless Women, the charity refused to take Lohan on as a worker, ""saying you were a bad example,"" Sautner said. But Lohan seemed to find a good fit with her work at the Los Angeles County morgue, where Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said she worked four days in the past two weeks cleaning up. ""So, the morgue is willing to keep you,"" the judge said. All of her community service work has been transferred there, she said. In October, the actress' father, Michael Lohan, told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" program that his daughter shouldn't be in jail, but in rehab. Michael Lohan was arrested twice in two days last month for violating a court order to stay away from his former girlfriend. CNN learned last week that he is now in an ""administrative confinement"" cell in the infirmary section of Orient Road jail in Tampa, Florida, where he was awaiting trial. Lindsay Lohan's legal woes, which began four years ago with two drunk driving arrests, have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes. Her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless Lohan breaks any laws before then. It has been extended several times because of violations, including failed alcohol and drug tests. CNN's Alan Duke and Maria P. White contributed to this report.","NEW: Lindsay Lohan is focused on ""her community service obligation,"" her spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- He came out on court wearing a Halloween mask, but Novak Djokovic had to overcome a fright of his own before winning his comeback match in Switzerland on Tuesday. The world No. 1, playing his first ATP Tour tournament since winning the U.S. Open six weeks ago, survived a second-set scare against Xavier Malisse before beating the Belgian 6-2 4-6 7-5 at the Swiss Indoors event. Djokovic suffered a recurring back injury in Serbia's Davis Cup defeat by Argentina just days after beating Rafael Nadal in an epic final in New York. He missed tournaments in Asia, including the Shanghai Masters, but has returned to action in Basel where he was champion in 2009 and runner-up to Roger Federer last year. ""I'm only just back from the biggest injury of my career,"" Djokovic said after extending his record this year to 65-3. ""It was a big ask for me to have played really well. ""I could do nothing for four and a half weeks, I've only been hitting for a week and a half. That's not enough to play at my best. I've lost rhythm. ""I had too many errors and too many double-faults. But I'm happy just to be playing tennis again. I hope to build on this performance."" As top seed, he is in the opposite half of the draw from Federer and new world No. 3 Andy Murray, who could meet in the semis. The 24-year-old will next play either Poland's world No. 59 Lukasz Kubot or 91st-ranked German Tobias Kamke, who both came through the qualifying draw. Fifth seed Mardy Fish's hopes of qualifying for the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals suffered a blow when he was forced to retire with a hamstring injury against fellow American James Blake after winning the opening game. Fish holds the last of the eight places on offer for the London showpiece but could be overhauled if he has to miss the penultimate tournament in Paris starting next week. Blake will next play Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin, a lucky loser from qualifying who upset American wildcard Donald Young in his opening match. Stanislas Wawrinka, a semifinalist in 2006 and the Swiss No. 2 behind Federer, beat Croatia's Ivan Dodig 6-4 6-4 to set up a match with either Murray or Dutchman Robin Haase, who meet on Wednesday. Federer's next match is against Jarkko Nieminen, after the Finn beat Brazil's Thomaz Belluci 6-7(5-7) 6-4 6-3. Tomas Berdych had the sixth finals place ahead of his clash with Japan's Kei Nishikori, but the Czech failed to earn any ranking points after losing 3-6 6-3 6-2. Seventh-ranked Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga closed to within five points of Berdych by winning his opening match at the Valencia Open on Tuesday. Tsonga had to battle before beating 19-year-old Spanish wildcard Javier Marti 4-6 7-5 6-2 to secure his 12th win in 14 matches and set up a second-round clash with American Sam Querrey -- who defeated Latvia's Ernests Gulbis 6-4 6-4. Top seed David Ferrer is one of the five players already qualified for London, and he overcame fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 6-3 6-2 in his opening match to set up a meeting with Canadian qualifier Vasek Pospisil. French third seed Gael Monfils went through with a 6-3 6-1 win over Albert Montanes, but Ukrainian seventh seed Oleksandr Dolgopolov Jr. was eliminated by another Spaniard, Marcel Granollers.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic wins his first match in six weeks at Swiss Indoors event .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal must qualify for Euro 2012 through the playoffs after losing 2-1 to Denmark Tuesday night in Copenhagen. Portugal needed only to draw the Group H game to reach the finals after five straight wins, but came up short against Morten Olsen's men. The Danes scored through Michael Krohn-Dehli and Sunderland striker Nicklas Bendtner with Ronaldo grabbing a consolation goal in injury time. It was a massive setback for Portugal, who have also missed out on qualification as the best runners-up spot. That honor has gone to Sweden, who beat Group E winners the Netherlands 3-2 in Stockholm. Goals from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Dirk Kuyt put the Dutch 2-1 ahead into the second half before Sebastian Larsson scored from the spot after a penalty was awarded following a handball by Joris Mathijsen. Almost straight from the kick off Ola Toivonen put Sweden back in front and they held on to inflict the first defeat on the Dutch since they lost the 2010 World Cup final to Spain. Bosnia Herzegovina came close to an upset against France in the Stade de France after Manchester City's Edin Dzecko scored with a superb curling shot just before halftime. But Laurent Blanc's France, who needed only a draw to seal their qualification from Group D, leveled through a late Samir Nasri penalty after he had been fouled. Bosnia now go into the playoffs. Elsewhere, reigning World and European champions Spain ended Scotland's slim hopes of a playoff spot as they rounded off their Group I qualifying campaign with a 3-1 home win. David Silva put Spain ahead after six minutes and added a second just before the break to sink the Scots. The Czech Republic won 4-1 in Lithuania to claim the playoff spot.

"(CNN) -- Much-needed rain fell across drought-stricken Texas on Sunday, offering relief but no end to what's been one of the state's driest years on record. Some areas received more rain in a day than had fallen all summer. Waco, Texas, where temperatures hit at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit 78 days this year, received 5.83 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas got 1.37 inches of rain, while San Antonio received 3.06 inches -- a record for the date. The weather service forecast rainfall amounts over the central and southern Plains of 1-3 inches per hour, with totals of more than 10 inches possible in some places by Monday morning. ""This should put a significant dent in the ongoing severe drought over portions of the area, but this amount of rain in a short period of time could also lead to possible flash flooding across northern Texas and Oklahoma,"" the weather service said. It added that drought conditions are expected to persist because of the magnitude of the shortage. With much of the state in an exceptional drought, Texas has been scarred by one of the worst fire seasons in memory. Since wildfire season started in November, more than 3.8 million of the state's 167.5 million acres have burned in some 24,000 fires, according to the Texas Forest Service. Roughly 2,800 homes were destroyed. ""What the state needs is several widespread rainfall events over several months,"" the weather service said. Heavy rains and slippery field conditions at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington forced the postponement Sunday of the second game of the American League Championship Series. Weather permitting, the Texas Rangers and Detroit Tigers will make up the game Monday afternoon.

Continental success has also been achieved, with Ferguson leading United to two European Champions League triumphs in 1999 and 2008. The highlight of the former Scotland coach's reign so far arrived in 1999, when United's Champions League final win over Bayern Munich completed an historic treble which also included Premier League and FA Cup triumphs. United he stands: The real Fergie . ""It's been a really fantastic spell for me and something you don't think is going to happen,"" Ferguson told the club's official website. ""It's been a bit of a fairytale to last so long and I appreciate that."" Ferguson, who arrived at United from Scottish outfit Aberdeen on November 6 1986, was quick to praise the vast array of star players he has been able to work with during a quarter of a century at the club. ""I've been very fortunate to have some of the best players in the game and, when I look back on these players I think about how fortunate I am. Ferguson's top 25 Manchester United moments . ""It's incredible when you look at who's been here - Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Brian McClair, Mark Hughes, Paul Ince, Roy Keane, Eric Cantona. What a collection of fantastic players."" It could all have been very different for United and Ferguson, with the Glasgow native originally planning to retire from football in 2002. But Ferguson changed his mind, remained in the Old Trafford dugout and last season helped United to a record 19th English title -- overtaking the mark previously set by archrivals Liverpool. Ferguson refuses to set a date for when he will step aside at United, saying he will remain in the job as long as his health allows. ""I'll continue as long as I feel healthy enough to do it,"" he said. ""In management, things change as the years go on. It's different now even to seven or eight years ago. A lot of things have changed."" United's neighbors Manchester City currently lead England's top flight, five points clear of Ferguson's team. Former United captain Steve Bruce brings his Sunderland team to Old Trafford for a Premier League clash on Saturday.","Alex Ferguson calls his Manchester United reign a 'fairytale'

"(CNN) -- Ireland --- once Europe's 'Celtic Tiger' -- was last year felled by its black hole of a banking sector, and forced to tap Europe's bailout fund. The country continues to live off bailout funds -- yet in September internet giant Twitter announced its intention to set up headquarters in Dublin. It will join Facebook and Google, which both have their headquarters in the Irish capital. The move suggests Dublin could again become a major player in the technology industry, despite the country's financial woes. According to Noel Ruane, head of Dogpatch Labs Europe -- which likens itself to a 'frat house for geeks' -- the city has enough of an internet community to rival Silicon Valley. Dogpatch Labs was created by the U.S.-based venture capital company Polaris Venture Partners, and provides a space for aspiring entrepreneurs to brainstorm with like-minded people. The center has also chosen to call Dublin its European home, with Ruane as its entrepreneur in residence. Ruane believes Dublin is a good base for emerging companies, despite their consumers being located elsewhere. Many companies are web based, and don't need to be near their customers, he says. He acknowledges language barriers can prove more difficult for companies in Europe than in other parts of the world, such as the U.S. ""There is a localization requirement; we don't have one homogenous market like the U.S. where there are 300 million plus people that companies can target."" But he says the nature of the web means businesses can be successful from wherever they're located, including Dublin. But while Dublin's reputation as an internet hub is growing, many developers are still honing their skills in the U.S first before establishing themselves in Europe. ""I meet companies all the time where the founders have returned home after perhaps graduating from Stamford University and spending some years with the large internet companies in Silicon Valley,"" explains Ruane. ""They have all that experience so that they can set up business back in Europe."" CNN's Emily Smith contributed to this story.","Twitter announced in September it would set up shop in Dublin .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- All 50 states plus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., submitted applications to the Department of Transportation for grants to fund DOT projects, but -- in a sign of tough economic times coupled with a shortage of federal dollars -- not everyone is finding presents under the federal Christmas tree this year. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced Thursday that 46 transportation projects in 33 states and Puerto Rico will receive $511 million in the latest round of Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants. See the list of projects (PDF) The Transportation Department had received a total of 848 applications requesting $14.3 billion, exceeding the $511 million available under the TIGER program. The grants will fund a range of transportation work in urban and rural areas from light rail systems and ports to bridges, roadways, runways, pipelines, streetcars and bike-share projects. Among the biggest grants: $20 million for Chicago to complete 3.6 miles of track on the city's transit authority's Blue Line, serving millions of passengers, as well as expanding a bike-share program. The Missouri Department of Transportation also received $20 million for roadway improvements along the I-270 corridor in St. Louis. Three grants were directed to tribal governments to create jobs and provide transportation needs. A grant of $3.7 million was given to the Seminole Tribe of Florida to improve several miles of road on the Big Cypress Reservation. The existing road has two 10-foot lanes with worn, unpaved shoulders and substandard sidewalks, according to DOT. Officials say the improvements will enhance emergency hurricane evacuation routes and enhance access to commercial and tourist destinations. The smallest grant went to the Native Village of St. Michael, Alaska, which received a $1 million grant to resurface and re-contour roads to provide better access to schools and improve drainage issues that arise from seasonal flooding. Obama orders contracts be awarded by year's end . LaHood, who was in Cincinnati, Ohio, Thursday to highlight a streetcar project, told reporters the allocation of funds is coming months ahead of schedule to allow communities to move forward with critical, job-creating infrastructure projects. ""Our economic challenges have been decades in the making and won't be solved overnight,"" said LaHood. The city of Cincinnati was awarded a nearly $11 million grant to design and construct the Streetcar Riverfront Loop that the transportation department says ""has the potential to revitalize"" the city's urban core by providing a public transit alternative. Work has already begun on 33 planning projects while 58 capital projects are under way from the previous two rounds of grants. LaHood said an additional 13 projects are expected to break ground within the next six months. Of the $511 million in available funds, more than $150 million will go to projects in rural areas. Almost half of the funding will go to road and bridge projects. An additional $16 million will be used to pay for administrative costs to make sure the program is properly administered ""by the book,"" said LaHood. DOT says grants are awarded to transportation projects that have a significant national or regional impact. the department gives priority to work expected to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.","Projects range from roadways to light rail systems to bike-share programs .

"(CNN) -- The father of Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney has been arrested and bailed by Merseyside Police over an inquiry into suspicious betting patterns concerning a Scottish Premier League match last year. Wayne Rooney Senior, 48, was one of nine people arrested on suspicion of fraud, relating to a match between Motherwell and Hearts on December 14 2010. The eight other people arrested and bailed include Rooney's uncle, Richie, 54, and Liverpool-born midfielder Steve Jennings, 26, who plays for Scottish side Motherwell. A police statement read: ""Merseyside Police can confirm that all of the nine men arrested on Thursday October 6 as part of an investigation into suspicious betting activity have now been released on police bail pending further inquiries. ""All nine were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and all have been released on police bail until late January while inquiries continue. The joint investigation by Merseyside Police and the Gambling Commission remains ongoing."" Rooney's father later released his own statement in which he vigorously denied allegations of being involved in a football betting scam and was ""co-operating fully"" with the police investigation. Solicitor Anthony Barnfather, who is representing Rooney Senior, said in a statement: ""Mr Rooney vigorously denies all of these allegations. We are co-operating fully with the investigation. No further comment will be made at this time.""

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- They left home with hope in their hearts, thousands of fans true to the Liverpool anthem, dreaming of reaching another Wembley FA Cup Final. The disaster at Hillsborough football stadium in 1989 resulted in the deaths of 96 football supporters. But what began as a day out in the spring sunshine 20 years ago ended as the darkest hour in the history of British football. I had settled into Row B Seat 2 of the press box in the south stand at Hillsborough, home to Sheffield Wednesday and neutral venue for the game. From there I would have had an uninterrupted view of the semifinal showdown between Liverpool and Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. Clough, one of the legends of the British game, had been denied an FA Cup Final with Forest a year earlier, when his side lost to Liverpool at the same stage of the competition and at the same venue. The atmosphere in the ground for the 1989 semifinal exploded as the teams emerged onto the pitch. But none of us was prepared for what was to follow. The match action lasted less than six minutes. I can't remember a single kick. What I do recall quite vividly are the scenes of distress, desperation and death at the Liverpool end that destroyed so many families and shocked the world. Looking to my left and behind Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar's goal, I was drawn to a huge mushroom-like effect among the crowd in the central standing enclosures around kick-off time.  See Liverpool players and fans paying tribute to victims of Hillsborough disaster Â» . The match had not long started when the first signs of a major problem surfaced. Fans began frantically attempting to climb over the perimeter fence to escape the crush at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. I didn't know it at the time, but the swell was the exit point of a tunnel that ran under the stand. Through it hundreds of Liverpool fans had attempted to make their way without realizing the two caged pens it led to were already overcrowded. Many had the life squeezed out of them in that tunnel. Others were trampled or crushed to death on the terraces. The lucky ones clambered to safety, many collapsing on the pitch. Some fans were hoisted up into the stand above by fellow supporters, but the main escape route was over the high perimeter fence and later through a small gate that was forced open as police -- who initially thought they were dealing with a pitch invasion -- recognized the true scale of the problem. Advertising boards were used as makeshift stretchers and some of those being carried away had their heads covered by coats. The Sheffield Wednesday gymnasium became a mortuary. The Liverpool end of the pitch resembled a casualty station with frantic efforts being made to treat the injured and save lives while others wandered aimlessly around the pitch in a daze. I will always remember the bid to revive one young fan in front of the main stand. Those efforts seemed to go on forever before finally hundreds of spectators let out a huge cheer as the lad at last showed some sign of life. I still wonder to this day whether or not he made it. Meanwhile I had an open phoneline to a copytaker at The Press Association and described those shocking events unfolding in front of me, including news of the first fatalities. For the second time in four years I had gone to cover a football match and ended up filing a disaster report. In 1985 I had been in Brussels with Liverpool to cover their European Cup final against Juventus, when 39 fans, mainly Italian, were killed at the Heysel stadium as a wall collapsed after trouble on the terraces. That match eventually went ahead after a delay of 85 minutes. Within hours of returning from Belgium, I was among a small group of football writers summoned to No. 10 Downing Street for a meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Mrs Thatcher planned draconian measures to combat what became known as the English disease, but it was the appalling events at Sheffield that finally became the catalyst for change. The Hillsborough tragedy was played out in full view of 53,000 spectators and TV cameras. People who came to watch a football match went home haunted by scenes of carnage and chaos that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Later, in an area beneath the empty south stand, FA chief executive Graham Kelly faced media at an impromptu press conference and expressed his shock, sadness and sorrow. Understandably, he didn't have all the answers as questions were fired his way. What led to the disaster is well documented. Lord Justice Taylor, a High Court judge commissioned by the government to produce a report, concluded that police operational errors were largely to blame for allowing the gates to be opened to relieve congestion outside the ground. Many questioned why the kickoff to the game had not been delayed. English football was quick to react with perimeter fences pulled, followed by the phased-in arrival of all-seater stadia. In the aftermath grieving fans turned Liverpool's Kop stand and the Anfield pitch into a shrine draped with thousands of scarves, flags and flowers. A permanent memorial to the victims was later erected adjacent to the Shankly Gates -- named after the club's most famous manager -- and which bear the title of the Reds' anthem: You'll Never Walk Alone. The oldest victim at Hillsborough was 67, the youngest 10-year-old Jon-Paul Gilhooley, a cousin of current Liverpool captain and England international Steven Gerrard. Gerrard was six weeks away from his ninth birthday at the time of tragedy. There is nothing Liverpool would want more than to mark the 20th anniversary season with at least one gleaming trophy. They did it in 1989, beating Forest when the semifinal was later replayed, then going on to defeat city rivals Everton after extra time at Wembley. On that occasion they returned home with hope in their hearts.","96 Liverpool fans died as a result of the Hillsborough disaster on April 15, 1989 .

"(CNN) -- A former teacher in Oklahoma has been charged with sending lewd images of young female students to a retired professor in Pennsylvania, authorities said Thursday. Kimberly Ann Crain, who taught third grade in McLoud Public Schools, faces 23 criminal counts, including manufacturing and possessing juvenile pornography, distribution of juvenile pornography and lewd molestation, according to a Thursday filing in Pottawatomie County district court. The alleged recipient of the photos and videotapes -- sent via e-mail and Skype -- was identified as Gary Joseph Doby. Students allegedly knew him as ""Uncle G,"" according to authorities. The retired Bloomsburg University professor also has been arrested, according to Oklahoma City FBI special agent Clay Simmonds. Doby, 65, faces eights counts of manufacturing juvenile pornography and one count of conspiracy to manufacture it. Doby's location following his arrest could not be confirmed Thursday night, nor could it be determined whether he was being represented by an attorney. CNN's attempts to reach Crain's attorney Thursday night were unsuccessful. According to the complaint, Crain, 48, took photos of the girls in a classroom and at a pizza party at her home. After a search of Crain's home, police confiscated computers and numerous documents and asked for FBI assistance, Simmonds said. Crain was arrested on December 1. The FBI found information on the woman's Skype account that led them to Doby, Simmonds said. A search Thursday of Doby's home yielded a computer ""among other questionable items,"" the FBI said. As he was being led away from his arraignment and extradition hearing, Doby told a reporter for CNN affiliate WNEP in Scranton, Pennsylvania, ""Be kind and considerate to my family, because they're going to need it and they didn't have anything to do with this. They need prayers and it's me, not them."" Crain is accused of taking photos or videos of girls, in many cases with either their breasts or genitals exposed. A concerned Shawnee, Oklahoma, parent contacted police in mid-November after she became aware of contact the teacher had with students at her home, Simmonds said. Crain had invited the students to her home for a pizza party, according to a Shawnee police probable cause affidavit. A parent said her daughter told her that Crain took photos of the girls, dressed in bras and panties she provided, while decorating a Christmas tree, the affidavit states. The underwear had Christmas themes with words like ""Ho! Ho!"" on them, the affidavit states. According to witnesses cited in the affidavit, Crain also would hold up a sheet in the corner of the classroom and have the girls strip down to their bras and panties. The teacher allegedly took photos of the girls, telling them ""Uncle G"" is going to want to see these pictures."" The affidavit states the FBI found numerous sexual chats between Crain and Doby on Crain's personal laptop computer. An FBI agent said that in some chats, Doby identified some of the students by name and described how ""he liked the features of their private parts and indicated that he wanted to see them nude. Within the recovered chats, Doby instructed Crain to get the girls to cooperate."" Another parent said she learned from her daughter that a hidden camera or video camera in Crain's home captured images of the girls changing into T-shirts and panties. McLoud Public Schools said it is cooperating with law enforcement agencies. ""As you now know, the Pottawatomie County District Attorney's office was in the midst of conducting an intense and in-depth investigation; therefore, we complied with its request to not release any information which would in any way jeopardize the investigation, and ultimately, an additional arrest,"" the schools said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Bloomsburg University told CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KWTV that Doby retired in 2008. CNN's Jake Carpenter, Jeremy Ryan, Nick Valencia and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Former teacher accused of taking lewd photos of young Oklahoma girls .

"(CNN) -- The vast sums of money made by football's middle men continues to soar, with English Premier League clubs this week detailing huge amounts paid to agents for helping to seal multi-million-dollar deals during the last 12 months. Big-spending table-toppers Manchester City predictably had the highest outlay, paying agents to the tune of $15.2 million between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2011 for aiding the transfer of players such as Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko. Immediately behind City were Tottenham Hotspur ($12 million) and Liverpool ($11 million). These figures beg the question, what do England's biggest clubs gain from the use of agents and why are the payments made to them so large? The total ÃÂ£71.87 million ($112.8 million) spent in that period is a rise of almost $7.5 million. ""It's very hard to know, to be honest -- clubs need to give us some answers,"" World Soccer Magazine editor Gavin Hamilton told CNN. ""There's no reason that they should be that high, because most of those clubs have very good scouting networks."" Poland and Ukraine primed for Euro 2012 kick-off . Hamilton believes that with clubs now possessing wide-ranging global scouting networks, the need to pay such large sums to agents should be lessened. ""They discover and scout players themselves, and the clubs that aren't scouting players are relying on agents. They don't need to be doing that. They've got their own scouting network,"" he said. With agents primarily employed to negotiate deals on behalf of players with their respective clubs, Hamilton argues it is the footballers themselves who should foot the bill for their services. ""It's the player that hires the agent to secure them a transfer, a new contract, so the players really should be paying the fees,"" he said. ""It's a big surprise to me that clubs continue to cover agents' fees, rather than insist the players, who are so well paid, reward their agents for the work they've done."" While the spending on agents could be considered as an unnecessary expense, Hamilton praised England's top division for showing the sort of transparency lacking in other top European leagues. ""I think it's a positive that the Premier League actually publishes the information,"" he explained. ""The Premier League has to be applauded for publishing the figures. ""It's a good thing that they're published, it's a bad thing that they're so high."" Hamilton also outlined the danger of having agents who represent managers and players employed by the same club, such as when manager Mark Hughes and Argentina striker Carlos Tevez were both at Manchester City while being represented by Israeli Kia Joorabchian. ""I think certain clubs rely on particular agents who are not just representing players, but also representing managers,"" he said. ""Managers now have agents. The Sunderland appointment, replacing Steve Bruce, there are a number of managers in the frame for the job who are with agents who also have high-profile players. ""There's a clear conflict of interest there and clubs tend to rely on managers who share an agent with players, and I think that is a dangerous situation to get into."" Hamilton wants stronger regulations placed upon agents, and hopes that financial fair-play regulations set to be introduced by European football's governing body UEFA will help improve the situation. The new rules are aimed at preventing clubs across Europe spending beyond their means in pursuit of on-field success. ""It's the nature of the modern game at the moment, it's unregulated and the money is going out of the game into the bank accounts of agents,"" Hamilton said. ""I think over the next few years we are going to see more regulation with UEFA's financial fair play. ""What they're trying to do with financial fair play is have a system in place where clubs regulate their own spending, and clubs are aware that they can't just be throwing money at players and wages. ""I think UEFA are moving in the right direction, but it's the clubs who have got take up the initiative. There will always be agents around trying to take money out of the game.""","The English Premier League has revealed the amount spent by its clubs on agents .

"(CNN) -- Three law enforcement officers patrolling a remote stretch of northern California woods shot dead a double-murder suspect whom authorities had been hunting for 36 days, a sheriff said. Aaron Bassler was wearing black clothing and carrying a large backpack, a fanny-pack and assault rifle when three Sacramento sheriffs spotted him early Saturday, Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman said. From about 40 yards away and at an elevation 25 feet higher, they fired about seven rounds into his upper torso. Allman said Bassler didn't fire a shot, and there was no verbal exchange between the parties. The suspect raised his weapon -- which was loaded and not on safety -- from the ground toward law enforcement officers. It is believed to be the same weapon used to kill one of his victims, officials said. The suspect was considered ""armed and dangerous,"" and was believed to have engaged in a gunfight with three other law enforcement officers from Alameda County two days earlier. There was no ""shoot-to-kill"" order in effect, Allman said. ""I fully support the manner in which this happened,"" the sheriff said, responding to inquiries that the suspect was killed without any warning or having fired a shot. ""There will be no more lives endangered by Aaron Bassler."" Authorities wanted Bassler for the killing of Jere Melo on August 27 just east of Fort Bragg on the northern California coast 10 miles north of Mendocino. Melo, 69, was an Army veteran as well as a former mayor and then-councilman in Fort Bragg at the time of his death. A witness saw a gunman open fire and later identified the suspect, according to Allman. He has also been identified as the suspect in the August 11 slaying of Matthew Coleman in Westport, just north of Fort Bragg. Allman said Saturday that DNA evidence linked him to Coleman's death. For over a month, more than 40 local, state and federal law enforcement agencies have teamed up to look for him. In the process, he has been a suspect in several burglaries in which he kicked in locked doors and made off with food and guns, said Allman. One such incident occurred between Thursday and Friday in a garage-shop about two miles from where Bassler was eventually found. A police bloodhound tracked his scent, helping steer authorities in the direction that they believed the suspect might be -- and leading to the operation Saturday. The officers who gunned down Bassler were among about 15 three-person teams brought in from around the state for the search. Bassler's family was ""not happy"" when a law enforcement official contacted them Saturday about the death because the press had already put out the news, according to the sheriff. ""I do have some feelings for the Bassler family, they suffered a loss today,"" Allman said. ""(But) I assure you, that the other two losses that we felt in this county were something that law enforcement remembered every day."" A $30,000 reward for information leading to Bassler had been offered. There was no indication Saturday that anyone will receive it.

"(CNN) -- A major clean-up operation is underway along the north coast of New Zealand's North Island as debris and oil leaking from a cargo ship that ran aground on a reef wash ashore, officials say. The Rena, a Liberian-flagged vessel, struck the Astrolabe Reef, about 12 nautical miles off the city of Tauranga, last week. New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), estimates that as much as 300 tonnes of fuel oil has leaked from the vessel, which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters (450,000 gallons) of fuel. The country's environment minister, Nick Smith, has called the spill New Zealand's most significant maritime environmental disaster. As of Friday, clean-up teams collected 95.45 tonnes of solid waste and 6 tonnes of liquid waste from beaches in the Bay of Plenty, MNZ said. About 60 kilometers of coastline, from the towns of Maketu to Mount Maunganui, is contaminated with oil, the agency said. Pubic access to some waterfront areas has been restricted due to health concerns. ""We are now coordinating a team of around 1,000 people involved in operations on land, sea and air and covering areas like field operations, planning, logistics, wildlife recovery and community and iwi [indigenous Maori people] liaison,"" said National On Scene Commander Nick Quinn. MNZ said that 500 dead birds have been found following the oil spill. The agency said 140 people scoured the coast yesterday for wildlife affected by the spill and 51 oiled animals are being treated at a center that has been set up in Tauranga. A team has been established to capture seals and five of the animals are being kept in captivity. Greenpeace has expressed ""extreme concern"" about the spill and urged the government to avoid using further toxic dispersants. ""This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea,"" the organization's Steve Abel said. ""Even a slow and relatively accessible oil spill like this one has clearly stretched New Zealand's response capability to its limits,"" he said. ""It is also a potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area, as well as numerous other marine species."" MNZ said that 88 containers had fallen off the ship, 20 of which have washed ashore. Due to the hazard the containers pose to shipping, the agency said navigational warnings had been issued and major maritime traffic has been re-routed. The Rena has suffered substantial structural failure and there is a concern that the stern of the vessel may break up, MNZ said. Salvage teams have three tugs mobilized either to hold the stern on the reef while efforts continue to remove oil from the ship, or to tow the stern to shallow water to extract the oil, the agency said. Containers remaining on the vessel continue to move, making it dangerous for salvage crews to work on board. Salvors have worked to build a platform to attach to the side of the vessel today to be used to assist fuel recovery operations, MNZ said. The ship's second officer appeared in Tauranga District Court yesterday to face a charge of ""operating a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk,"" MNZ said. The Rena's captain was remanded on bail on Wednesday on the same charge, on the condition he surrender his passport. His name has not been released. If convicted, they face a maximum fine of $7,800, or up to 12 months imprisonment. CNN's Karen Smith and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","About 60 km of northern coastline of North Island is contaminated with oil .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- On the heels of international condemnation of the bombing of a refugee camp, a satellite monitoring group said Friday that Sudan is enhancing its airstrike capabilities along its border with South Sudan. The U.S.-based Satellite Sentinel Project said that since taking control of the border town of Kurmuk on November 2, the Sudanese Armed Forces appear to be upgrading military facilities. It said Sudan has started fortifying the airstrip and positioned armor nearby. Digital imagery, analyzed by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, showed four new helicopter landing pads, three helicopter gunships and an Antonov, a plane often used in Sudanese bombing campaigns, on a newly improved airstrip in Blue Nile state's capital of Damazin. The satellite project also reported a new 250-meter expansion of the Damazin airstrip. The project's co-founder, John Prendergast, said the buildup is alarming. ""The airfield improvements suggest Sudan's readiness to widen its aerial bombing campaign in its border areas of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, as well as neighboring South Sudan,"" he said. ""If this buildup and bombing campaign isn't countered aggressively by the international community, it appears likely that Khartoum's actions will plunge Sudan even more deeply into internal war as well as ignite a full-scale war with South Sudan."" Charlie Clements, head of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School, said the analysis of the images underscored an ""urgent threat to human security on both sides"" of the border. Conceived by actor George Clooney, the Satellite Sentinel Project combines satellite imagery analysis and field reports with Google's Map Maker technology to provide an early warning system to deter the resumption of war between north and south in Sudan. The two sides fought a bitter, bloody civil war that cost as many as 2 million lives. Before the independence of South Sudan in July, human rights monitors expressed concerns that long-standing grievances could end in violence consuming the region again. The United Nations human rights chief called Friday for an investigation into the bombing Thursday of the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan's oil-rich Unity state. ""The camp at Yida, which is close to the border with Sudan, is housing thousands of civilians, including women and children,"" said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay. ""While the number of casualties is not yet clear, I understand that five or six bombs were dropped on the camp, and that at least one fell close to a school,"" she said, calling for an ""independent, thorough and credible investigation to establish the precise circumstances of this aerial bombing."" The camp houses about 20,000 refugees who have fled the violence in the states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and the Nuba Mountain region straddle Sudan and South Sudan's ethnic and political lines. Although these territories are geographically part of Sudan, the population has faced ""exclusion, marginalization and discriminatory practices that have resulted in their opposition to the Sudanese government,"" according to the U.N. human rights office. Sudanese Armed Forces began launching aerial attacks against rebels in the region shortly after the Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir ordered the dismantling of joint units that had integrated South Sudanese and Sudanese military fighters within Southern Kordofan. Fighting between the Sudanese army and rebel groups has flared in border areas in the months since South Sudan became the world's newest nation. Friday, the Sudanese state news agency SUNA reported that the Sudanese army had repelled an attack by the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement/Army-North in the South Kordofan town of Talodi. Last month, hundreds of rebels were killed in fighting, according to government officials. The SPLM/Army-North once represented the northern chapter of the SPLM, which now governs newly independent South Sudan. Many of its members come from the states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile. The rebels, however, said they were successful in thwarting a Sudanese attack. ""The fighting in Talodi is an extension of a government offensive everywhere in South Kordofan and Blue Nile state,"" said Yasser Arman, secretary general of the SPLM/Army-North.

"Denver (CNN) -- Raymond Davis, who was charged with killing two men in Pakistan as a CIA contractor but was later released, was arrested Saturday after a fistfight at a shopping center in Colorado, authorities said. Davis was charged with misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct after allegedly getting into a fight over a parking space at a suburban Denver mall, according to Lt. Glenn Peitzmeier of the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. The incident at the Highlands Ranch Town Center began as an argument between 37-year-old Davis and 50-year-old Jeff Maes and then turned physical, Peitzmeier said. Davis was released after posting $1,750 bond, Peitzmeier said. Davis' wife, Rebecca, declined a CNN request for comment. Davis was charged with killing two men in Lahore, Pakistan, in January. He was released in March after compensation was paid to their families. U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and tried to claim diplomatic immunity but then revealed that he was a CIA contractor. Davis said he killed the two men in self-defense, though Lahore authorities called the case ""clear-cut murder.""","Raymond Davis is charged with misdemeanor assault, a sheriff's official says .

"(CNN) -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott met late Thursday with a group of several hundred Florida A&M students upset over his recommendation that trustees suspend the school's president in the wake of alleged hazing and ""financial irregularities."" Chanting ""We've got questions. You've got answers,"" the students marched to the governor's mansion, promising to stay until Scott changed his mind. ""We are not going to leave,"" said Breyon Love, the FAMU student body president. ""Mr. Governor, with all due respect, we will be here all night, all day tomorrow until you apologize or rescind that recommendation."" Appearing in a gray sweatshirt, Scott addressed the crowd through a megaphone outside the mansion, thanking them for caring and coming out. ""I want the best thing for FAMU. I want the best thing for the FAMU family. I want the best thing for the great state of Florida,"" the governor told students, although not conceding to their wishes. Earlier, Scott had told the chairman of FAMU's board of trustees, Solomon L. Badger III, that he felt the board should take further action against university President James Ammons when it meets Monday, the statement said. The governor also ""placed a call"" to Ammons to notify him of these conversations. ""I think it's in his best interests (to) make sure that there is no question that this university is doing the right thing and cooperating,"" Scott said Thursday. The discussions came after Scott returned Thursday from a trade mission to Israel and was briefed by staffers on recent developments out of the Tallahassee university, according to the governor's office. Ammons responded Thursday that he was ""sure that this investigation will determine that, under my leadership, the administration acted appropriately."" At the same time, he said he was prepared to accept his fate. ""I serve at the pleasure of the FAMU board of trustees, and I will abide by whatever decision the board reaches,"" he said. Badger also released a statement in which he acknowledged ""a communication with the governor."" He said he hadn't talked with other trustees, promising that ""we will make a decision about how we move forward Monday."" ""This is a very difficult decision that we are facing,"" Badger said. The band's director, Julian White, has been placed on administrative leave. One trustee, Rufus Montgomery, advocated a week ago that the university president should likewise be suspended -- but, instead, the board voted then to reprimand him. ""If you can place ... Julian White on administrative leave pending an investigation outcome, then we as a board can place James Ammons on administrative leave, procedure-wise,"" Montgomery said December 8. The school president had pledged Wednesday to ""root out this culture of hazing,"" though he declined to offer details about what specifically might change. Band drum major Robert Champion Jr., 26, died after a November 19 football game following a suspected hazing incident. He ""reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe,"" authorities said in a statement. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. No cause of death has been released. Some band members said he may have died after a rite of passage called ""crossing Bus C."" One member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that members ""walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus back backward while the bus is full of other band members, and you get beaten until you get to the back."" About three weeks before Champion's death, freshman band member Bria Hunter suffered a cracked femur, deep bone bruising and blood clots after being beaten repeatedly on the thighs, according to arrest affidavits from Tallahassee police. Three men -- Sean Hobson, 23, Aaron Golson, 19, and James Harris, 22 -- were charged with hazing, a crime under Florida law, this week in her case. Hobson and Golson additionally are charged with felony battery. ""We're sending all these kids off to school. ... We expect them to come back with an education and alive,"" Scott said Thursday. The university's troubles go beyond the hazing reports. Jerry Bailey, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said Wednesday that authorities looking into Champion's death had found evidence of ""financial irregularities having to do with the band and several other components of the university."" The suspected fraud is not directly related to Champion's death, Bailey said. ""It became apparent (from) some of the people that we interviewed (that) the financial irregularities had to do with the band travels and other sports and administrative components of the university,"" he said. The state commissioner said it is premature to conclude that the irregularities are ""systemic,"" adding that it is too soon to tell how much money may be involved. But, he added, ""it's not just isolated"" to the band program. In a statement Wednesday, Badger -- chairman of FAMU's trustees -- said the university could not comment, ""but we are cooperating fully with this and all investigations."" The governor said Thursday that he isn't advocating that Ammons resign but rather ""step aside"" until the investigation is complete. Ideally, this inquiry will show that whatever problems are ""isolated,"" he added. ""My goal is to have a thorough investigation that everybody feels very comfortable that everybody cooperated with,"" Scott said. ""Hopefully, there was nothing more (Ammons) could do."" Champions' parents did not reference Ammons specifically during an interview, which was conducted with HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky before Scott made his recommendation. Yet the young man's father did state that it was important that there's accountability -- for both Champion's death and hazing in general. ""I think the school should be held accountable, I think that each organization should be held accountable,"" Robert Champion Sr. said Thursday. ""We have to get down to the root of the problem, so that everyone can be responsible."" His wife, Pam Champion, said their family will champion anti-hazing education efforts and look into setting up a hotline through which people can anonymously call in reports of hazing. She said that everyone at FAMU -- from administrators, to students, to alumni -- and other schools need to work together to stop hazing, which she called endemic to a larger cultural issue. ""If you're not going to be part of the solution, then you are part of the problem,"" Pam Champion said. ""The idea is to (get) rid of the whole culture, the whole mind-set of it."" CNN's Jason Carroll, John Branch, Rich Phillips and Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants FAMU president James Ammons to step down amid hazing investigation .

"(CNN) -- President Obama has repeatedly stated, ""We are tougher than the times we live in."" Although the president may not have intended to signal a whole new approach to our future, the line has Churchillian implications. Speaking of tough times, he could call on Americans to recognize we face at least a decade of rough sledding, ask us to face the challenges and express confidence that we shall prevail. The tough times approach differs radically from the prevailing wisdom that if we merely did X, Y or Z, we would be rolling in clover again. All we need to do is cut deficits, reduce taxes some more and lighten up on regulations, and the nation will be back on the right course. Others foresee the bottoming out of the housing market, within two years or so, as the turning point to recovery. Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff argues that intentionally inflating the dollar is the ""the only practical way to shorten the coming period of painful deleveraging and slow growth."" In general, politicians prefer President Reagan's manner, which was oozing with optimism. And they are leery of sounding like President Carter, who spoke of malaise and called for sacrifices. But times have changed. The American people must be prepared for what is coming, or they will lash out with even more anger against failed promises. Take the most elementary issue: Nobody reasonable, on the right or the left, denies that we lived beyond our means for decades, financing our indulgence by taking loans from the Chinese, Japanese and British, among others, as well as hocking the assets of our future generations. Now the time has come that we must pay back, and that means reducing the deficit. Such payback means, by definition, that while we once could float a lifestyle that cost, say, 120% of what we earned, now we shall have to do with lifestyle that costs, say, 80% of our income, with the rest going to pay down what we owe. After decades of indulgence and accumulating debt, our accounts cannot be settled in a few years. According to a report in NPR, using recent Congressional Budget Office projections, the debt could reach $13 trillion in 10 years. Even if we get the ""grand bargain"" and $2 trillion to $4 trillion is cut, that means the 10-year deficit could still remain between $9 trillion and $11 trillion. True, we do not have to bring it down to zero, but we still have quite a burden with which to contend. If we must pay for that deficit by raising taxes, we will have less money. If we must cut services, such as health care, to pay down the debt, people will have to buy these services themselves. And we should pay down our personal debt for our own future and that of our children. That means for the next decade or even longer, Americans will have to do with less, from buying new clothes to going on vacations. I am hardly the only one who foresees a ""lost decade."" A recent Atlantic magazine article argues that even by 2011, 2012, even 2014, the employment rate may decline very little and describes the current economic climate as ""a trauma that will remain heavy for quite some time."" Heidi Shierholtz of the Economic Policy Institute predicts that ""many factors are pushing against a quick recovery. ... Things will come back. But it's going to take a long time."" Frustration to such shortfalls is mounting. A recent Bloomberg poll found that 72% of the people who responded think the country is on the wrong course economically. The president's approval rating is tanking, but that of Congress is even lower. A New York Times/CBS poll found that only a paltry 12% of respondents approved of Congress. As I see it, ""Washington"" can do relatively little to spare Americans at least 10 years of austerity. But, public leaders can prepare people for what is coming and make a virtue out of doing with less, of paying back what we owe even if it hurts Ã¢â¬â without implying that recovery is right around the corner or that something drastic can be done so we will not have to pay more taxes and do with less services. If it turns out that Easy Street is much nearer than I expect, then people prepared for ""tough times"" will rejoice. But if they believe the economy will bounce back quickly, and in reality face prolonged austerity, we must expect even more angry outbursts. We've avoided the violent demonstrations seen in Greece, the massive demonstrations against inequality seen in Tel Aviv and the random torching of cars common in riots in Germany, France or Britain. If Obama can speak candidly about the coming tough times and the shortfalls we all will have to accept as part of the cure, he may do better; we most assuredly will. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Amitai Etzioni: Despite promises and proposals, there is no quick fix for economy .

"(CNN) -- The crew of an Italian ship seized by pirates on Monday was freed Tuesday thanks to an operation by U.S. and British troops working with the Italian military, the Italian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. Eleven pirates who hijacked the Montecristo surrendered to the troops operating under NATO's Operation Ocean Shield, the ministry said in a statement. All crew members are safe, the ministry said. They barricaded themselves in the engine room after throwing a message overboard in a bottle and putting up a cardboard sign to let rescuers know where they were. They were able to retain control of the ship's steering, even though the pirates destroyed the ship's communications equipment, a NATO officer said. The USS De Wert was the first ship to arrive on the scene, and monitored the hijacked vessel until the British ship HMS Fort Victoria arrived with a boarding team, Lt. Gwenn Laine of NATO told CNN. The pirates threw their weapons into the sea as the boarding team closed in, and stood on deck to surrender once they boarded, Laine said. He praised the crew for following ""best maritime practices,"" saying that by barricading themselves in a safe place they probably avoided violence. The pirates are in NATO custody, said Laine, who works with the alliance's Operation Ocean Shield. The captain sent a message Monday indicating that the vessel had been attacked by a ship with five armed people on board, the D'Alesio Group said in a statement. The captain immediately activated security procedures, the statement said. The ship was about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the Somali coast at the time. The crew includes 23 people from Italy, Ukraine, and India, the D'Alesio Group said. Their rescue came shortly after Italy said it would start putting military guards on ships traversing the pirate-infested waters off the coast of Somalia . Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa is signing an agreement Tuesday with the confederation of Italian shipowners to put military guards on board vessels in the area of the Indian Ocean at risk from Somali pirates, his ministry told CNN. Both NATO and the European Union have naval missions dedicated to protecting ships in the region, but hijackings remain common. As of late September there were some 400 hostages held by Somali pirates, according to the International Maritime Bureau. There have been 24 successful hijackings this year to date and 194 incidents. The number of incidents is up from last year, but the number of successful hijackings down, according to the IMB. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Chris Lawrence, Claudia Rebaza, Gisella Deputato, Laura Perez Maestro and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","NEW: The crew threw a message overboard in a bottle to say they were safely barricaded .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Just before Syrian security forces launched a large-scale military operation in the southern town of Daraa in the early hours of April 25, the commander of the 35th Special Forces Regiment, Brig. Gen. Ramadan Mahmoud Ramadan, allegedly gathered his troops and explained their mission. ""Use heavy shooting. Nobody will ask you to explain,"" the brigadier said, according to ""Amjad,"" one of the many defectors I have interviewed in the last months. Amjad explained to me that normally the troops were supposed to save bullets, but this time it was different. ""The commander said to use as many bullets as we wanted."" Over the next four days, security forces in Daraa killed around 200 people (Human Rights Watch documented the abuses at the time by interviewing victims and witnesses) and arrested thousands, subjecting many to beatings and torture. Since then, Amjad and more than 60 other defectors from Syria's military and intelligence agencies have given us crucial information about who was responsible for abuses across the country. They provided consistent accounts of officers giving similar orders to military units all over Syria, at different times. The orders were to stop the protests ""by all means necessary."" In many cases, they said, officers gave orders to fire directly at protesters. The defectors told us that some soldiers reacted by throwing away their weapons and making a run for it. Others aimed above the protesters' heads or to the ground. But that was dangerous. Eight defectors told us that they saw officers and intelligence agents killing soldiers who disobeyed orders. Others were detained and tortured. We are not publishing the defectors' names and locations to protect them and their families. All these statements demolish President Bashar al-Assad's claim that the bloodshed is the result of a few rogue commanders getting overly enthusiastic on crowd control. The defectors' testimonies paint a horrific picture of a widespread and systematic crackdown against demonstrators: torture, arbitrary arrests and a ""shoot to kill"" policy that clearly amount to crimes against humanity. Al-Assad and his allies have sought to portray the protesters as ""armed gangs sponsored from abroad."" In more than nine months of investigations in Syria, we have documented episodes of fighting, and attacks on security forces by armed defectors have increased. But the vast majority of protests that we documented were nonviolent, and the government's use of force was clearly excessive compared with any threat facing troops. The Syrian leadership has so far gotten away with murder, in part because the Russian government, one of Assad's staunchest allies, has blocked action on Syria at the U.N. Security Council and continues to supply Syria with arms. The Syrians whom I interviewed were well aware of Russia's obstructionist position. As Ghassan, a former officer, was serving tea during our interview, he suddenly stopped and looked at me with suspicion. ""I heard you are Russian -- if you say that you support their position on Syria, you won't get any tea!"" He was joking, of course, but his anger at Russia was real. Since Russia blocked Security Council action in October, Syrian security forces have killed more than 2,000 people, according to the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay. Russia's continued obstruction sends a signal to the Syrian government that it can continue its violent crackdown with impunity. It is difficult to conduct human rights investigations on Syria, since the government has barred most journalists, human rights monitors and even a U.N. commission of inquiry. But it is not impossible. I managed to enter Syria and speak safely with victims there, and we continue to interview witnesses in neighboring countries. We've spoken to hundreds of Syrians with firsthand knowledge of abuses. And in a report Human Rights Watch released Thursday, we're naming 74 commanders, from generals to colonels to captains, who allegedly ordered, authorized or condoned the abuses. But responsibility for these crimes does not stop with the commanders on the ground. Under international criminal law, al-Assad, as commander in chief of all forces in Syria, bears responsibility for the most serious crimes committed by his forces -- even if he did not order them -- to the extent that he knew or should have known about the abuses and failed to prevent them. Given the widespread public and international criticism of the abuses, it would be incredible for al-Assad to argue that he did not know. Pillay told the Security Council this week that the death toll in Syria tops 5,000, including 300 children killed. Amjad's commander may have told his troops that ""nobody will ask you to explain,"" but he was wrong. It's time for the Security Council to act: to impose an arms embargo on Syria, to apply targeted sanctions to al-Assad and his circle of cronies, and, most important, to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. That is where Ramadan, his fellow commanders and his bosses will have to explain themselves and where their many victims will receive justice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anna Neistat.","Anna Neistat: Defectors say Syrian military told them to use ""heavy shooting"" in Daraa attack .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE) -- When people talk about fashion week, they are usually referring to London, Paris, New York and Milan. When I discovered that Islamabad was having its first ever fashion week, I was especially intrigued. In a country where the majority of women cover up and similar events in the past have been threatened with fundamentalist attacks, this had to be about promoting Pakistan's textile industry in a strangled economy. The majority of Pakistan's population wears traditional Shalwar Kameez or Burkha, are vehemently religious, poor and enjoy about a 50% illiteracy rate. I quickly learned that there are pockets of Pakistani society that have Western sensibilities, which warrants the fashion industry to grow and justifies the need for a fashion week. The British High Commission advises against all but essential travel to Pakistan. After pondering how essential fashion journalism is, against the wishes of my family I flew out to Islamabad in January with the director William Fairman to document an event so incongruous with the Pakistan we see on the news, people thought we'd made it up. This fashion week represented an exclusive elite of Western-centric Pakistanis. I managed with relative ease to secure carte blanche to film fly-on-the-wall at the event, with the exception of filming people boozing or blaspheming on camera. For example, before we left I was warned I'd better cover up and wear long dresses, which is evident in the film. As soon as I arrived I realized that I needn't have worried, that most of the girls at the fashion week dressed like Western girls. It was just one example of how Pakistan is misunderstood in the West. See the rest of Pakistan Fashion Week at VICE.COM . For a week I watched relatively scantily-clad models on a runway in a blast-proof basement of a 7-star hotel just a short drive from the Islamic militant hubs in the troubled northwest. There was a latent atmosphere of volatility: fundamentalists don't have to try hard to work out that these hotels are crawling with Westerners and Pakistani liberals 365 days a year. As a result, the seats at the fashion shows were often half-empty. Social events such as these are few and far between in Pakistan. A young Pakistani rapper we met while out there told us how he struggles to perform live, as live events are often shut down for risk of militant attacks. More than serving as a platform for the textile industry and an attempt at improving Pakistan's world image, the Fashion Week was predominantly just something for people to do, a distraction from the adversity of daily life there. I spent a week in the care of Pakistan's affluent elite, and my time with them taught me that Pakistan is an acutely divided country of extremes. There is a great deal of resentment towards this outmoded elite from the rest of the country. There is no middle class as we know it. This privileged community lives in compounds with armed guards at their gates. They employ a live-in staff and a chauffeur. They inhabit a bubble of ersatz Western life. One woman told me she thought that fashion, not drones, was the answer to Pakistan's problems. Whether this is the case, or not, remains to be seen.","VICE goes to Pakistan for a behind-the-scenes look at fashion week in Islamabad .

"(CNN) -- It was described by evangelical pastor Jerry Falwell as ""obscene trash."" High schools and public libraries banned it, while teenagers -- male and female -- hid it under their beds like a dirty magazine. Women across the country passed it to their friends, their sisters, their neighbors. They read chapters about rape in closets with flashlights. They gaped in dorm rooms at the photos of childbirth. The landmark women's health handbook was filled with sometimes graphic information about the most intimate aspects of women's lives. It was revolutionary in its candid discussions -- and depictions -- of the specifics of sex, birth control, childbirth, lesbianism and other formerly taboo topics. In 1971, the first ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" book sold 250,000 copies. Today, it is available in 25 languages and has sold more than 4 million copies. It's hard to believe it all began in Boston with just 12 women. They met during a women's liberation conference in 1969. At the time, fewer than 10% of doctors were women, and topics like sexuality, pregnancy and abortion were rarely discussed. But a long conversation after a workshop on women and their bodies prompted this small group to launch the beginning of the women's health care movement. ""Many of them had had very bad experiences around their health and medical care, around their encounters with physicians,"" ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" executive director Judy Norsigian remembered. ""You lived in an era then where, if you went to a physician, and you were a married woman, and you (were diagnosed with) gonorrhea, your physician would tell your husband and not you."" The next year, their work came to fruition: a 193-page booklet printed on newsprint titled ""Women and Their Bodies"" that sold for just 75 cents. ""Part of why (the booklet) got off the ground is because women wanted to change this kind of environment in which what women had to say, where what women reported about their own experiences, could be so readily discarded,"" Norsigian said. In August, Time magazine named ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" one of the best nonfiction books since 1923. This year, the organization behind the book, the Boston Women's Health Book Collective, celebrates its 40th anniversary with a new edition. Norsigian was the youngest member of the 1971 editing team and still plays a big part in editing the text. Norsigian spoke with CNN about the controversial book, the strides in women's health care since then and the one thing she hopes readers take away. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: Describe yourself in the early 1970s. What were you doing, and what were you wearing? Norsigian: In the early '70s, I was just out of college. The year after I graduated ... I lived on a farm as part of a small commune and learned a tremendous amount about organic gardening. This is before it came in vogue. I met through mutual friends the women who had produced the newsprint edition of ""Our Bodies, Ourselves."" I was acutely aware of the lack of good information out there for women of all ages, so I was very excited about being a part of this effort. You can't ask me what I wore, because I can't remember. ... I probably had a bell bottom or two in those days. CNN: What were some of the most controversial issues covered in the first book? Norsigian: Well, there's no question about that. I would say there were three things that drew fire from various sources. One is the lesbian chapter; it was called then ""In Amerika they call us dykes."" That was obviously going to be very controversial because there was huge resistance to the idea of homosexuality. When people tried to ban the book in schools, they often pointed to this chapter as ""filthy trash."" The second, of course, is the abortion chapter (which was still illegal at the time) ... and the third -- can you guess? -- it's masturbation. That was singled out in the sexuality chapter as one of the sections that was inappropriate, pornographic, you name it. CNN: ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" was definitely known as a feminist book in the 1970s. Do you still identify with that ideology? Norsigian: There is no question in our minds that it's a feminist book. But one of the problems that has emerged over the last several years or so is that members of the media have failed to educate themselves about what feminism means, so there's been a lot of distortion. (The term) has different definitions depending on who you talk to. One of the things we hope is that by having people read a book like this, which is feminist but is not anti-male ... is that they'll adjust their thinking about what feminism consists of. CNN: How has society's view on women's health changed since the first book came out? Norsigian: There were three things that kept hitting us between the eyes: sexism, paternalism, condescension -- things that really interfered with getting good health and medical care. There was also a lack of good data. Much medical care was driven by convention. ... There are many, many examples of where the medical care was not good or appropriate for the situation. (To get where we are today) has taken better research, it's taken a strong advocacy community, and it's taken reaching out to the general public. CNN: What are the biggest issues facing women today? Norsigian: We still have a long way to go. If you don't deal with things like education and housing, access to health care, these are critical issues that ultimately have a profound impact on women's health and well-being. The single greatest influence on a woman's health and well-being is her poverty status. ... If you look at surveys across the globe, many women identify violence as the biggest threat. So that's not often fully appreciated. Most of the issues we write about are not just about a single person dealing with an individual choice; it's really connected to a larger reality where we can, if we take action, do something to reduce the problem to begin with. CNN: What's new in this year's edition of the book? Norsigian: The new book has a focus on sexual and reproductive health across the lifespan. There's a whole chapter on gender identity and sexual orientation. Many chapters are totally redone incorporating new awareness, new activism. The perimenopause chapter is totally different. The politics chapter is totally different ... with a much more in-depth discussion of health care reform. The sexuality chapter includes a wiki conversation; I think more than 200 people contributed to a several month-long conversation that was then synthesized into this fabulous collection of insights and exchanges. CNN: Why did you decide to focus on just sexual and reproductive health? Norsigian: Well, you're going to laugh. The book was becoming too encyclopedic, and we also wanted to return to earlier versions where we had more space for women's experiences and stories. So that was one of the reasons. But in the end, we got so much good content. ... It ended up being longer than the last book in 2005. It's not something you're going to carry around with you; it's more than 3 pounds. CNN: With so much information out there and varying opinions on almost everything, how do you edit the book to ensure that it's unbiased? Norsigian: Well, everybody has a point of view, and everybody has a bias. There's no question that that exists, whether we try hard to keep it out or not. One of the ways we (try) is by having people with different biases go at the same text, making their case with one another. CNN: With all the Internet resources out there, what's the purpose of owning a comprehensive book like this? Norsigian: I talk on about 60 college campuses a year, and you won't believe the misinformation young people have. This is one of the ironies that we face now. There are more and more sources of information. ... It's out there to find, but you have to know where to look. There's tremendous amounts of misinformation, distorted information. That's one of things about this book: It's probably the most trustworthy source about women and health out there. CNN: What's one thing you hope women take away from the book? Norsigian: I would say that we can all make more intelligent decisions about personal health and medical care as well as the policies we want to see in our communities. The key is finding reliable sources of information that will guide those kinds of decisions.","In 1971, the first ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" book sold 250,000 copies .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fighters loyal to Libya's new leaders say they have ""reached the final stages of the fight"" to take control of former leader Moammar Gadhafi's hometown. About 10 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the fighting overnight, said Al Zubair Al Kadi, a field commander on the frontline in Sirte, on Sunday. Troops loyal to the National Transitional Council also entered the pro-Gadhafi stronghold of Bani Walid for the first time on Sunday, said Abdulla Kenshill, an NTC spokesman there. NTC forces ""liberated"" nearby the villages of Teninai and Shuwaikh overnight, and advanced to within a kilometer (about three-fifths of a mile) of Bani Walid's main market, he said. They also took control of the airport in the southwest of the city, he said. Five fighters were badly injured, he added. In Gadhafi's hometown, NTC fighters ""took over Sirte University last night and all the residential buildings around it, including the student dormitories,"" Al Kadi said. Troops loyal to the National Transitional Council ""caught many African mercenaries, mostly from Mauritania, while our men were combing the buildings for snipers,"" he said. At least one hospital held out but fell to the new authorities on Sunday, he said. ""Our fighters now have full control of the Ibn Sina main hospital in Sirte after fierce clashes,"" he said, adding that 17 pro-Gadhafi fighters had been captured. ""You can say that we have reached the final stages of the fight,"" he said before the hospital was taken. The fall of Sirte cannot come soon enough for Libya's new leaders, eager to declare liberation once the birthplace of Gadhafi is under their control. But battles for the coastal city southeast of Tripoli have raged for weeks as Gadhafi loyalists dug in and put up stiff resistance. The NTC lost 26 men Friday, said Mohammed Sayeh, a senior council member. But he said he was confident that Sirte would be under the council's control within days. That is what the council's military commanders told U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta Friday, according to a senior U.S. defense official traveling with him. Panetta met with the commanders at the naval base that hosts the U.S. Sixth Fleet in Italy, the official said. The commanders said they have no reason to believe Gadhafi has any control of those militia members who remain loyal to him, the official said. They further believe that, although the anti-Gadhafi forces are gaining the ability to exercise control, they will likely need training to develop their capabilities, the official said. Still, no timetable has been drawn up for when commanders will recommend that NATO forces end their involvement, the official said. Gadhafi, wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, for on charges of crimes against humanity, has not been seen in public in months. Syrian-based television aired an audio message Thursday that was purportedly from the deposed leader. In it, the speaker urged Libyans to protest the nation's new leadership. CNNs Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: A hospital in Sirte, one of the last bastions of pro-Gadhafi troops, falls, the NTC says .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Samsung Electronics said Friday it is expecting weaker third quarter sales as demand for flat screen televisions and computer chips falls. The South Korean technology giant forecasts an operating profit of 3.75 trillion won ($3.5 billion), down 13% from a year earlier. Profits are expected to rise though from the previous quarter by 12%. Analysts say Samsung's handset sales are helping weaknesses in other businesses. ""Semi conductors are still strong and even if they don't make as much profit, it's not because they're less competitive, it's because the semiconductor market as a whole went down. As for smart phones, they are becoming comparable with Apple, they haven't surpassed Apple yet but they are catching up very fast,"" Lee Sun Tae of Meritz Securities in Seoul said. Experts also say the strengthening US dollar against the Korean won helps exports and the bottom line. Lee estimates a small increase in the dollar's strength of less than one cent could result in an extra $250,000 profit for Samsung. Lee believes the US dollar will continue to gain strength for the rest of this year.","Analysts say Samsung's handset sales are helping weaknesses .

"London (CNN) -- A tiny handwritten and unpublished manuscript by ""Jane Eyre"" author Charlotte Bronte has sold for $1.07m after it sparked a fierce bidding war between rival museums. The second issue of Bronte's ""Young Men's Magazine"" -- written in 1830 when she was just 14 -- smashed pre-sale estimates of $310,000 to $465,000, and set a record for manuscripts by the Bronte sisters. It contains three stories, written in Bronte's tiny, cramped hand, one of which is said to prefigure the story of Bertha, Mr. Rochester's insane wife in ""Jane Eyre."" It was bought by the Musee des Lettres et Manuscrits in Paris, where it will go on display in January. The Bronte Parsonage Museum, in the family's hometown of Haworth, Yorkshire, had earlier launched an appeal to raise money to allow them to buy it, but were outbid in the sale at Sotheby's in London. Philip Errington, director of the auction house's books and manuscripts department, said the Bronte item was ""of huge literary significance."" ""The record price set today reflects the international interest in Charlotte BrontÃÂ«'s work. ""This tiny manuscript represents her first burst of creativity and provides a rare and intimate insight into one of history's great literary minds."" The Bronte Parsonage Museum already owns four of the six manuscripts in the ""Young Men's Magazine"" series. The whereabouts of the sixth magazine are unknown. Charlotte Bronte (1816-1855) and her sisters Emily (1818-1848) and Anne (1820-1849) wrote some of the best-loved novels in the English language, including ""Jane Eyre,"" ""Wuthering Heights"" and ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.""","Parisian museum wins bidding war for unpublished Charlotte Bronte manuscript .

"(CNN) -- When word came down Monday that an ownership lockout would cancel at least the first two weeks of this year's NBA season, players' association president and Los Angeles Lakers point guard Derek Fisher had a three-word response. ""LET US PLAY."" But they didn't come in a press release or a statement in front of a bank of news cameras. Instead, they were on Twitter, the social-media platform where the league's stars have millions of followers and where they hope their high profiles will win public sympathy during an increasingly bitter labor fight. It's not the first time pro athletes have used the site's micro-blasts of info to make their case in such disputes. In fact, ""let us play"" was a refrain used by the NFL players' association on Twitter during last summer's labor negotiations, which were settled without any regular-season play being missed. But it may be the first time it's been an integral part of a plan to sway public opinion. ""This is an orchestrated effort by the players attempting to gather attention and support for their cause, much in the same way carrying a picket sign might have in another era,"" said Eric Rabe, senior adviser at the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government, where he studies the use of social media. Fisher added the hashtag ""#standunited"" to his post, a tag other players have adopted, allowing Twitter users to follow all of their tweets in one place. In a letter to fellow players after it was clear that negotiations had broken down between players and owners, Fisher said he and New Orleans Hornets point guard Chris Paul would be ""utilizing our personal social networking channels to show the fans and you all that we are united and want to get back to work under a fair deal."" ""We invite you each to do the same,"" he wrote in the letter, which was obtained by Sports Illustrated. ""To show our unity and to remind the fans that this is not our choice and we would like to go back to work and play the game they love to support."" Some of the game's biggest stars took the cue. ""I wanna sincerely say sorry to all the fans! It's a sad day for all of us, especially u guys!"" Miami Heat superstar LeBron James wrote on his Twitter feed. ""There's no US w/o You."" And that, observers say, is where the players have the advantage. James has 2.5 million followers on Twitter. His teammate Dwyane Wade has 1.7 million. Almost all of the league's top players who are active on the site are followed by hundreds of thousands of fans. (Twitter, not Facebook, has been the go-to platform for NBA stars' messages about the labor dispute.) ""It's logical for the players to take this approach,"" said Rabe, who as head of Verizon's corporate communications was responsible for spearheading that company's social-media efforts, as well as representing it through several labor disputes. ""They've got a resource there to exploit and an issue they want to get on the table in front of the fans. I'm sure they'll have some success with it."" In most labor situations, management is less apt to appeal directly to the public for a variety of reasons, Rabe said. ""I'm not sure that's necessarily wise, but that's a tendency that management has in these situations."" That's certainly been the case in the NBA talks, during which owners have remained much lower profile.. Dallas Mavericks boss Mark Cuban is the league's most high-profile owner and one of its most active on Twitter, with more than 700,000 followers. But despite tweeting regularly, the often-outspoken Cuban does not appear to have mentioned the lockout in recent days. One of his other projects, cable channel HDNet, has gotten more mentions than the NBA of late. Other high-profile owners were equally mum about the lockout. Portland Trail Blazers owner (and Microsoft co-founder) Paul Allen has 23,000 followers but has focused recently on tech-industry startups and one of his other properties, the NFL's Seattle Seahawks. Sacramento Kings co-owner Joe Maloof hasn't posted on Twitter since September 19, and his brother and partner, Gavin, has been tweet-free since May. With nearly 3 million followers, the NBA's Twitter feed is more popular than that of any of its active players. But as of Tuesday afternoon, it had featured only a single matter-of-fact tweet acknowledging the lockout. ""As a general matter, I've usually advised the management to be active in communicating while in a labor negotiation,"" Rabe said. ""I do not believe you have an advantage when abandoning the public discussion to the other side."" Discussing complex labor talks on a fast-moving and unfiltered platform like Twitter has its risks, however. The Twitter account for Kenyon Martin, who played for the Denver Nuggets last season, appeared to have been deleted Tuesday after he seemingly wrote an offensive post Sunday during a back-and-forth with followers. ""All Haters Should catch full blown Aids and Die! Do the world a Favor! and rid us of ya all!"" read a post on his feed. It was later deleted. In a subsequent tweet, Martin denied writing it. Whether social media ultimately plays a role in how the labor dispute is resolved remains to be seen. But, for either side, it's very likely worth a try, according to Rabe. ""Certainly, in labor negotiations, both sides are looking at the public support they're getting as an indicator of how long they can hold their hardline position,"" he said. ""Right now, it looks like they're both holding hardline positions, but something's going to have to give sooner or later.""","As NBA lockout threatens season, players take to Twitter to make their case .

"(CNN) -- A controversial exhibition featuring preserved corpses having sex opened Thursday in Germany's capital. Gunther von Hagens' controversial ""Body Works"" shows have traveled throughout the world. Part of his traveling ""Body Works"" exhibition, ""The Cycle of Life,"" is showing at Berlin's Postbahnhof and features 200 human bodies at various life stages -- from conception to old age, including embryos and fetuses taken from historic anatomical collections. In one exhibit a male body is lying on his back with a woman sitting astride him with her back towards his head. Torsten Woehlert, spokesman for Berlin's Culture Ministry, told CNN that there has already been a number of complaints from the public in the press, though none have come to the ministry itself. He said: ""As it is not against the law, only against good taste, there is not much the government could do anyway."" Conceived by Gunther von Hagens -- dubbed Dr. Death in Germany -- the exhibition displays the bodies with their muscles, nerves and tendons on show using a preservation technique he pioneered called plastination. This process involves replacing all body fluids and soluble fat with specially manufactured plastics. On his Web site, the anatomist describes the exhibition's purpose and goal ""to reveal and expose the anatomical structure of the human body and its function, in a unique lesson, and to teach us about the complexity of the human body, its anatomy, and the importance of leading a healthy way of life."" What do you think? He added that the source of the exhibition is from donors -- people, who during their lifetime, declared their willingness, by informed consent, to display their bodies at the exhibition for the ""benefit of education, health and the awareness of the wide public to the different systems of the human body."" When asked about the coupling of sex and death, von Hagens told Germany's Bild that ""death and sex are both taboo topics. I'm bringing them together. Death belongs to life."" He added that ""without sex no life would exist."" Von Hagens' work has divided opinion in the past, with critics often doubting his scientific motives and accusing him of shocking people to gain publicity. His public autopsy in 2002 for British broadcaster Channel 4 -- the first in the UK for 170 years -- received hundreds of complaints. The authorities also threatened to arrest him after declaring the procedure illegal. Von Hagens justified his actions as ""demystifying the post mortem examination,"" and likened the medical profession to ""medieval priests who would not allow ordinary people to read the Bible,"" The New Scientist reported.","Cycle of Life features 200 human bodies at various life stages .

"(CNN) -- The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday morning in Oslo, Norway. A record number of nominations -- 241 -- were received by the Nobel committee this year. Of those, 53 are organizations, including WikiLeaks -- the website founded by Julian Assange that facilitates the publication of classified information. It made headlines for leaking documents and videos related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and also released thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables. Among the individuals thought to be strong contenders are several involved in fomenting peaceful uprisings in the Arab world. They include Wael Ghonim, the former Google executive who used social media to jump-start social change in Egypt, Tunisian blogger Lina Ben Mhenni, who criticized the regime long before the uprisings began, dispersing information to the outside world, and Israa Abdel Fattah, who helped organize Egypt's online April 6 Youth Movement in 2008 and played a role again in 2011. Other favorites are Sima Samar, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and a trailblazer for women's rights in Afghanistan, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Cuban dissident Oswaldo Payas Sardinas and Ghazi bin Muhammad, a Jordanian advocate of interfaith dialogue. Another organization which could be in with a shot is Memorial, a Russian civil rights group known for its fight for to protect refugees and victims of political persecution and human rights violations in war zones. Apart from the winner, the names of the nominees cannot be revealed by the Nobel committee for another 50 years. Last year, Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo won the prize but could not attend the award ceremony. The political activist and longtime critic of communist rule in China is serving an 11-year prison term for what the Chinese government calls ""inciting subversion of state power."" U.S. President Barack Obama won for what the committee called ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples"" in 2009. Nobel prizes in literature, chemistry, physics and physiology or medicine were awarded earlier this week. Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday. The Swedish academy said it gave the award to Transtromer ""because, through his condensed, translucent images, he gives us fresh access to reality."" On Wednesday, the prize in chemistry was awarded to Israeli scientist Daniel Shechtman. Shechtman is a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and is known for his discovery of quasicrystals. On Tuesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences named Saul Perlmutter from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley; Brian P. Schmidt of Australian National University and Adam G. Riess of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics. They made the discovery that our universe apparently is expanding at an accelerating rate some 14 billion years after the Big Bang. The Nobel committee on Monday named Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, and scientists Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann, the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 91 times since 1901. The youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate is Mairead Corrigan, who was 32 years old when she was awarded the Peace Prize in 1976. The oldest winner is Joseph Rotblat, who was age 87 when he was awarded the Prize in 1995. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by a committee of five people chosen by Norway's parliament and is named for Alfred Nobel, a Swedish scientist and inventor of dynamite. Nominations come from lawmakers around the world, university professors, previous Nobel laureates and members of the Nobel committee.","A record 241 candidates are nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize .

"(CNN) -- These satellite photos taken before and after recent floods in Thailand show how the landscape has been transformed. The first slide contrasts two identical areas of Southeast Asia taken on November 12 2008 and November 1 2011. Captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on NASA's Terra satellite, the images show Thailand (left), Cambodia (middle) and Vietnam (far right). One hundred kilometers north of the Thai capital, Bangkok lies the historic city of Ayutthaya. Founded in the 14th century on the confluence of three rivers -- the Chao Phraya, the Lopburi and the Pasak -- it was an important trade center, once known as the ""Venice of the East."" After the rains, baby elephant brings hope . Today, that old moniker takes on a new meaning. Streets have become small rivers with surrounding farmland and floodplains submerged as images taken in July and October this year by NASA's Advanced Land Imager graphically illustrate. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that around 200,000 hectares of farmland have been affected by the floods across the country. The urban economy has also been thrown into flux with an estimated 1,000 factories affected. The country is a manufacturing hub for hundreds of electronics companies; the IUCN expects total economic losses from the disaster to exceed $3 billion. Thailand floods could create laptop shortage . On the northern outskirts of Bangkok, the Don Muang Airport -- the city's old international airport which now handles mostly domestic flights -- closed at the end of October after its runways became inundated with water. Perversely, Bangkok's new international Suvarnabhumi Airport (opened in 2006) occupies an area called Nong Ngu Hao (meaning Cobra Swamp) which used to be a floodplain. It is protected by a dike and remains open. The IUCN says natural floodplains are important in storing water during floods and in combination with wetlands and natural river channels can limit the impact of flooding. ""It's a classic case of urbanization being done blindly,"" says Ganesh Pangare, head of IUCN's water program in Asia. ""The drains have gone, the floodplains have gone, the plants that soak up the water have gone. This is a wake-up call to unplanned growth,"" he said.","Images from NASA satellites show how the floods in Thailand have inundated the land .

"(CNN) -- A ""significant"" amount of oil is leaking from a container ship that ran aground on a reef off the pristine coast of New Zealand's North Island, officials said Tuesday. New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), said in a statement that the ship has sustained ""some damage from current movement and there is a significant amount of oil leaking from the vessel."" MNZ estimates that 130-350 tonnes of oil have leaked from the vessel, which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters (450,000 gallons) of fuel. The agency said that the vessel was still intact, but was being moved around by strong seas. Clumps of oil from the leaking ship have been found on Mount Maunganui beach in the Bay of Plenty. MNZ is advising people to avoid the beach for health reasons. Oil began leaking from the Rena, a Liberian-flagged vessel, after it struck the Astrolabe Reef, about 12 nautical miles off the coast of Tauranga, on the North Island, on Wednesday, creating a five-km (three-mile) slick. Efforts to recover oil from the grounded ship, now heading south down the coast, are being hampered by high winds and strong swells. Approximately 10 tonnes of fuel oil was transferred to tanks on board a barge before the recovery operation was suspended on Monday. MNZ said dispersants are being tested on the oil that has leaked. However, there are sea swells of up to four meters, which can make it difficult for the dispersant to work. Worsening weather prompted the ship's crew to be evacuated as a precautionary measure after a mayday call was made on Tuesday. Naval architects and salvage experts on board the Rena are monitoring the vessel and have placed sensors to provide advance warning should the ship's structure come under too much stress. MNZ has established a one-kilometer maritime exclusion zone around the ship due to the health risk posed by the oil spill. National On-Scene Commander Rob Service said the operation to remove the oil from the ship, led by Svitzer Salvage, would be complex. ""There is no way of doing this quickly,"" he said. A rescue center has been set up in the city of Tauranga to clean oil from animals affected by the spill and MNZ has 12 teams working to assist oiled wildlife. Nine birds have been recovered -- seven little blue penguins and two shags, the agency said. About 300 defense force personnel are on standby for a shore cleanup if needed, the agency said. Officials fear the stricken ship may spill additional oil as its condition deteriorates. ""I think we'd expect that at some point to have further problems and potentially even break up,"" Transport Minister Steven Joyce told broadcaster TVNZ. Greenpeace expressed ""extreme concern"" about the spill and urged the government to avoid using further toxic dispersants. ""This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea,"" the organization's Steve Abel said. ""Even a slow, and relatively accessible oil spill like this one has clearly stretched New Zealand's response capability to its limits. ""It is also a potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area, as well as numerous other marine species.""

"(EW.com) -- After two weekends atop the box office, ""Puss in Boots"" was thwarted by a pair of newcomers, ""Immortals"" and ""Jack and Jill,"" both of which opened to solid numbers. ""J. Edgar"" wasn't quite as fortunate, but overall, the box office exhibited life like it hasn't for the past few months, and the top ten ticked up 18 percent over the same weekend last year -- a good sign headed into Thanksgiving. Check out all the details below: . Relativity's ""Immortals"" became the new box office titan, fending off competition and scoring a strong $32 million opening. While that number pales in comparison to the openings of 300 ($70.8 million) and ""Clash of the Titans"" ($61.2 mil), it puts ""Immortals"" ahead of other swords-and-sandals debuts like ""Prince of Persia"" ($30.1 mil) and ""Alexander"" (13.7 mil). The Tarsem Singh-directed visual feast, which stars Henry Cavill and Freida Pinto, also revives the ancient epic genre's viability in 2011 after flop openings from ""The Eagle"" ($8.7 mil) and ""Conan the Barbarian"" ($10 mil). For Relativity, a $32 million debut (66 percent of which came from 3-D screens) is a major win. The studio spent a surprisingly small $75 million on the film, and a rep told me on Friday that they were hoping for a $25-26 million start. Now, Relativity is hoping that broad appeal will continue to drive attendance. The studio's exit polling reveals that ""Immortals'"" audience was 60/40 percent male/female and ethnically diverse as well -- 35 percent Hispanic, 30 percent Caucasian, 13 percent Asian, and 12 percent African-American. According to Kyle Davies, Relativity's President of Worldwide Theatrical Distribution, ""A lot of people are enjoying the picture, and when you look down the road going into the holidays, there's just nothing for the action fans, so I think that's good for us."" But will the film actually continue to perform well into the Thanksgiving holiday? That could be difficult. ""Immortals"" looks like it may already be suffering from the fanboy effect, which occurs when eager sci-fi fans rush out to the theater en masse on opening night, thereby inflating numbers on the front end of a film's box office run. This can often lead precipitous drops in the days/weeks that follow. Just look at ""Immortals'"" weekend trajectory: the flick earned $15 million on Friday, followed by a 32 percent drop to $10.2 million on Saturday (while the rest of the Top 10 increased by an average of 8 percent), followed by a more-standard 33 percent decline to $6.8 million on Sunday. Davies attributes the large Friday-to-Saturday drop to the fact that Veterans Day fell on a Friday. He claims that with kids out of school all day, Fridays numbers were boosted substantially. We'll have to wait and see how ""Immortals,"" which earned an alright ""B"" CinemaScore grade, does in the weeks to come. In second place (for now) was Adam Sandler's latest comedy, ""Jack and Jill,"" which scored a $26 million debut out of 3,438 theaters -- good for a $7,563 per theater average. Sony's $80 million picture performed within expectations, but when compared to the rest of Sandler's bawdy mainstream comedy wheelhouse, this is one of his poorer results, and his worst live-action comedic opening (not including 2009Ã¢â¬Â²s death-themed dramedy ""Funny People"") since ""Little Nicky""'s $16.1 million bow in 2000. ""Jack and Jill"" received atrocious reviews, and while those have never stopped Sandler's films from succeeding in the past, there is a sense that the summation of so many truly awful critical reactions back-to-back-to-back -- when not balanced by winking affection for lovably dumb films like ""Big Daddy"" and ""Anger Management"" -- may actually be hurting Sandler's golden box office record. That being said, it's too soon to write off ""Jack and Jill."" Working in the cross-dressing comedy's favor is a family-friendly PG-rating, which could help ""Jack and Jill"" hold nicely with parents and children as we move into the extra-lucrative holidays -- although ""Happy Feet Two,"" ""Hugo,"" ""The Muppets,"" and ""Arthur Christmas"" will provide ample competition. But the comedy, which received a fair ""B"" CinemaScore grade, will have to work very hard to reach the $100 million plateau that Sandler is so used to. After two weekends in first place, ""Puss in Boots"" settled for third (though it may swap places with ""Jack and Jill"" once final results are released tomorrow) with an estimated $25.5 million. The ""Shrek"" spin-off only dropped 3 percent last weekend, and this time around, ""Puss"" scored another terrific 23 percent decline. The $130 million DreamWorks picture, which looked like a bust when it opened, has now earned a robust $103 million. With a Thanksgiving boost, ""Puss in Boots"" should march right past the $160 million mark with ease. ""Tower Heist"" drooped 45 percent this weekend to $13.2 million, giving the $85 million Universal caper a ten-day total of $43.9 million. The one-two punch of Brett Ratner's Oscar ousting and ""Tower Heist""'s underperformance have certainly taken the director down a few notches this week. Rounding out the top 5 was Warner Brothers' $35 million biopic ""J. Edgar."" The Clint Eastwood film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as infamous FBI figurehead J. Edgar Hoover, earned $11.5 million out of 1,910 theaters, giving it a solid $6,005 venue average. The tepidly reviewed drama opened slightly below Eastwood's last tepidly reviewed drama, ""Hereafter,"" which earned $12 million in its first opening weekend last year. ""J. Edgar"" may finish in the same range as ""Hereafter,"" which grossed $32.7 million total. The film played much like Leonardo DiCaprio's 2008 misfire ""Body of Lies,"" another film that paired him with a prestige director (Ridley Scott), but didn't connect with audiences and opened with $12.8 million. For DiCaprio, ""J. Edgar"" is no ""Inception"" or ""Shutter Island,"" but the star has always modulated between mainstream crowd-pleasers and smaller, more serious fare, and his star is not in danger. Audiences issued ""J. Edgar"" an uninspiring ""B"" CinemaScore grade. In limited release, two films stood out. After being available on-demand for a three weeks, Lars Von Trier's ""Melancholia"" still debuted with a solid $265,000 out of 19 theaters, leading to a $13,947 per theater average. Meanwhile, Emilio Estevez's directorial effort ""The Way"" has quietly hiked all the way to $2.6 million over six weeks ($334,000 from 171 locations this weekend), despite never playing in more than 283 theaters. The Martin Sheen drama is clearly experiencing good word-of-mouth on a small scale, so it will be interesting to see if ""The Way""'s distributor, Producer's Distribution Agency, pushes the film any harder in an effort to garner awards attention. In milestone news, ""Paranormal Activity 3"" has now earned $100.8 million after five weekends thanks to its $3.6 million frame. It has grossed $189 million worldwide against a $5 million budget.

"New York (CNN) -- Evelyn Lauder, a member of the Estee Lauder cosmetic company who helped create the pink ribbon symbol for breast cancer awareness, died Saturday in New York City. She was 75. Lauder died from complications of ovarian cancer at her home with her family by her side, the company said. The Vienna, Austria, native fled Nazi-occupied Europe with her parents, eventually settling in New York City. As a college freshman, she was introduced to the man she would marry, Leonard A. Lauder, the son of Estee and Joseph Lauder, who co-founded the cosmetics company. Lauder joined the family business and rose to be senior corporate vice president and head of fragrance development worldwide. Perhaps best known as an advocate for women's health, Lauder helped to create the pink ribbon, the now ubiquitous symbol for breast cancer awareness. She is survived by her husband, two sons and five grandchildren. ""My mother carried the torch of our company heritage and the values that were passed to her by my grandmother, Mrs. Estee Lauder,"" her son, William Lauder, said in a statement. ""My mother and father were life partners as well as business partners. They nurtured the culture and growth of the Estee Lauder companies, and as we grew, my mother was our creative compass and pillar of strength. Together my family and the company celebrate the beautiful person she was.""","Evelyn Lauder dies from complications of ovarian cancer .

"(CNN) -- Golfer Tiger Woods Tuesday addressed a racially-tinged remark made by his former caddy, telling reporters Steve Williams apologized and is not a racist. ""It was a wrong thing to say, something that we both acknowledge,"" Woods said, speaking at the Lakes Golf Club in Sydney, site of this week's Australian Open, according to his website. Woods and Williams met earlier in the day, and shook hands after Williams apologized, the website reported. Williams -- who was fired by Woods in July -- was being presented with a satirical award Friday night at an awards dinner in Shanghai, China, for comments he made after his new boss, golfer Adam Scott, defeated Woods at the Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio in August. Should Williams be punished for his remarks? According to media reports, when asked about those comments during his acceptance speech Friday night, Williams said: ""I wanted to shove it up that black a--."" Shortly afterward, the New Zealander issued a contrite statement on his website. ""I apologize for comments I made last night at the Annual Caddy Awards dinner in Shanghai,"" the statement said. ""Players and caddies look forward to this evening all year and the spirit is always joking and fun. ""I now realize how my comments could be construed as racist,"" Williams' statement said. ""However I assure you that was not my intent. I sincerely apologize to Tiger and anyone else I have offended."" Woods said Tuesday that Williams ""did apologize. It was hurtful, certainly, but life goes forward."" But he said he does not believe Williams is a racist. ""There's no doubt about that,"" Woods said, according to his website. ""It was a comment that shouldn't have been made and certainly one that he wished he didn't make."" Both the PGA Tour and the European Tour condemned Williams' comment, but he will not face sanctions. Scott said earlier he had discussed the matter with Williams and accepted his apology. ""There is absolutely no room for racial discrimination in any walk of life, including the game of golf,"" Scott said, according to the article on Woods' website. Williams said in July he was shocked and disappointed that Woods had severed their 12-year relationship, especially after he remained loyal to the golfer during the sex scandal in which he was embroiled for several months. ""Given the fact of my loyalty and the way that I stood by this guy through thick and thin ..."" Williams told CNN affiliate Mediaworks in New Zealand at the time. ""And the timing of it is very poor, from my perspective."" Williams said the sex scandal had caused him to lose respect for Woods. ""Well, I think when you're great friends with somebody and a situation like this occurs, you obviously lose some kind of respect,"" Williams said. In announcing he would no longer be working with Williams, Woods said it was ""time for a change.""

"(CNN) -- A gunman carrying a variant of an AK-47 rifle opened fire on uniformed Nevada National Guard members having breakfast at a Carson City, Nevada, restaurant, killing two of them and injuring three, officials said Tuesday. A civilian woman in the line of fire also died and five others were injured in the mass shooting at an IHOP restaurant, officials said. The attacker died later of a self-inflicted wound. The FBI said there was no indication of terrorism. Authorities said they had not determined a clear motive. ""To say that he was targeting before he came into the restaurant those military persons, we have not been able to establish,"" said Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong. ""Clearly, the fact that five of the 11 were military draws a concern by us."" The suspected gunman was identified as Eduardo Sencion, 32, who lived in Carson City and worked at a family business in South Lake Tahoe, California, authorities said. ""There was no indication he knew anyone in the restaurant,"" said Michael West, supervisory special agent with the FBI. Witnesses indicated Sencion said something while inside the IHOP, West said . Sencion had no previous criminal record on file but his family indicated he may have had mental health issues, Furlong told reporters. He was at the family business Monday night and spent the night in Carson City, officials said. Family members reported ""no unusual activity."" The AK-47 was recovered and authorities will determine whether it was an automatic, Furlong said. An empty 30-round gun magazine and two other gun magazines were recovered. A pistol and assault rifle were found in or near a vehicle, the sheriff said. The shooting began shortly before 9 a.m., according to Furlong. When authorities arrived, those who called in the incident identified the shooting suspect as a man lying wounded in the parking lot between two vehicles. The suspect had continued firing in the parking lot after leaving the restaurant, Furlong said. One individual was wounded outside. Steven Martin, a witness, told CNN Reno affiliate KRNV that he ran to see if he could help after he heard shots being fired. ""There was blood everywhere; broken glass everywhere. It was just a war zone down there,"" he said. A blue minivan registered to the suspect's brother was being studied, Furlong said. Chuck Allen with the Nevada Highway Patrol said officials were taking precautions in case military personnel were being targeted. ""When you have people in uniform randomly targeted ... we take that seriously,"" Allen said. The shooting took place just a few miles from the Nevada National Guard state headquarters in Carson City. The two deceased Guard members were men. Two of the wounded Guard members were women. Guard spokeswoman Maj. April Conway said officials will ""ensure we do everything possible to take care of our families and support our Guardsmen.""","NEW: FBI says no indication of terrorism .

"Minneapolis (CNN) -- Jared Pettingill's parents wanted a safe place for their son to attend school where he wouldn't be harassed for being gay. They found that place in the Minneapolis Public School district. ""It's just been really accepting in my experience,"" says Jared, a high school junior. He says he's ""never really dealt with bullying issues"" in middle school or high school. ""The amount of positive reaction to LGBT issues is really amazing."" Minneapolis Public School administrators admit that by no means has bullying been eradicated from their schools. However, they firmly believe that they are leading the way in creating a safe environment for all students. In January, the school board unanimously passed a unique resolution instructing administrators to track bullying incidents related to the harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students. The measure also requires all staff to be trained on LGBT issues. It injects LGBT topics into the curriculum, which includes adding an LGBT component to sex ed. They will eventually add an elective high school course on LGBT history. Just a few miles away, another Minneapolis-area school district has attracted national attention for its policy that deals with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students much differently. Neutral or not? The Anoka-Hennepin School District, just outside the Twin Cities, made headlines in recent years after seven students committed suicide between November 2009 and May 2011. Parents and friends say four of those students were either gay, perceived to be gay or questioning their sexuality. They say, at least two of them were bullied because of their sexuality. The school district says there is no evidence that the suicides were linked to bullying. Nevertheless, it stirred public debate over the school's sexual orientation curriculum policy. The district's curriculum policy, adopted in 2009, bars teachers from taking a position on homosexuality in the classroom and says such matters are best addressed outside of school. It's become known as the neutrality policy. Anoka-Hennepin, which encompasses the Twin Cities' northwestern suburbs and is the state's largest school district, is the only Minnesota school district known to have such a policy. In July, gay rights advocates filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of a group of students challenging the neutrality policy. The Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Center for Lesbian Rights told CNN that the lawsuit is currently in mediation. While the school district refrained from commenting on specifics in the lawsuit, it issued a statement in July noting that ""Anoka-Hennepin has been recognized as a pro-active leader in the state of Minneosta on bullying prevention."" The school district is also in the middle of a federal investigation into ""allegations of harassment and discrimination in the Anoka-Hennepin School District based on sex, including peer-on-peer harassment based on not conforming to gender stereotypes,"" according to a district memo. Superintendent Dennis Carlson says the neutrality policy -- which has attracted just as many local supporters as it has critics to heated school board meetings -- is a reasonable response to a divided community. ""It's a diverse community,"" Carlson told CNN earlier this year, ""and what we're trying to do, what I'm trying to do as a superintendent, is walk down the middle of the road."" The school district has a separate, comprehensive bullying prohibition policy, and Carlson said there is no link between the suicides and bullying. ""We have no evidence that bullying or harassment took place in any of those cases,"" the superintendent said. Carlson emphasized students need to report bullying, and he acknowledged ""gay students in our district struggle with bullying and harassment on a daily basis."" Damon Fietek, 16, knows that all too well. He says he was a target for bullies because his father, a middle school teacher in the Anoka-Hennepin school district, is gay. Damon's story . Jefferson Fietek had adopted Damon just before he started high school. The bullying began immediately. ""It upsets me a great deal,"" says Fietek, a middle school theater teacher. ""For him, being a kid from the foster system ... I was just really upset that he wasn't being allowed to celebrate the fact that he had a family now."" Damon said the harassment went on for a full year before he even told his dad. ""Students would say stuff to me...like 'Hey, did your dad rape you last night?' You know, just make those kinds of jokes at me,"" Damon said. The bullying wasn't just directed at him. He says it was a general hostility toward people who are -- or are perceived to be -- LGBT or who come from homes where a family member may be LGBT. ""I pulled him out of [that school],"" Fietek said. Damon now attends another school in the Anoka-Hennepin district with smaller class sizes. He says he hasn't had any problems. Fietek, an adviser to his school's Gay Straight Alliance, says when he first started working at the school, several teachers suggested he keep his sexuality to himself for his own job security. He decided it didn't make sense to keep quiet. Risking his job is a gamble he says he has to take because the issue is too important. ""I just compare it to what these kids' personal stories are, and they've got stories far worse than anything that's happening to me,"" Fietek said. In his adviser role, Fietek says he receives phone calls, texts and Facebook messages several times a week from students who feel like they are at a dead end because of bullying or uncertainty regarding their sexuality. Fietek believes the school district's neutrality policy has indirectly taken the side of the bullies by not supporting these kids. ""Some of the things we've put in place [have] just created a scary environment,"" Fietek said. Making it better . James C. Burroughs II used to bully kids when he was in school, calling other boys ""gay"" for no particular reason. ""If you did something on the athletic field that wasn't masculine or manly, you'd use the term 'that's gay' or the 'f' word -- the other 'f' word,"" Burroughs recalled. Today, Burroughs is the director of Minneapolis School District's Office of Equity and Diversity, which seeks to ""integrate equity, diversity, and inclusion into all aspects"" of the school district. Burroughs says his past is why he believes so passionately in putting an end to bullying, particularly of students who are perceived to be gay. ""What's important for me is acknowledging that that happened and making it better for another generation of students,"" Burroughs said. The Minneapolis School District has taken many steps to address the issue of bullying LGBT students, including training its staff on tracking bullying of these students, injecting LGBT topics into the curriculum, hosting an ""Out4Good"" LGBT support program, and implementing a bullying prevention curriculum called Second Step. ""It's very special,"" Burroughs said. ""I think we're a national leader when it comes to making sure that students and families in the school system K-12 are being treated and valued equally amongst all students."" Anti-bullying curriculum is woven into subjects like math, history and literature throughout each day, and staff from the teachers to the bus drivers are trained on how to create role play scenarios, says coordinator Julie Young-Burns. Ultimately it comes down to how each teacher feels they're best able to infuse the lessons into their already planned lessons on other topics, she says. High school junior Jared Pettingill says he notices bits and pieces of an LGBT inclusive curriculum on a regular basis. ""In my English class right now, at the end of the year we're gonna be reading a book called 'Giovanni's Room,' which is all about a bisexual character living in Paris, and it hinges on a lot of his relationships,"" he said. "" And there are a couple of other books like that that deal with lesbianism."" His parents support the school's proactive stance in teaching tolerance and offering support of LGBT students like their son. However, they say any policy is ultimately ""a piece of paper"" that won't work unless the message is embraced by everyone. ""It is our public officials, it's our media, it is each of us individually saying it's not OK to be hurtful to somebody else,"" said Marie Pettingill. ""Whether its LGBT or other issues kids experience, they should be able to be safe, and we shouldn't have to even think that we have to talk about that. Kids should be safe.""

"(CNN) -- Are airports equipped for the crunch of tech-savvy holiday travelers? Not really, according to a report from the folks at PCWorld, who say that only a fraction of the country's airports are ready for takeoff when it comes to meeting passengers' electronic needs. ""Overall, I would give the top 40 airports a C grade for accommodating tech-savvy travelers,"" senior editor Mark Sullivan said. ""The airports, together, offer an average of 5.5 outlets per gate. When you consider that most people are now carrying devices that need wireless service and battery charge-up, this number is woefully low."" Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW) tops the magazine's ""20 Best U.S. Airports for Tech Travelers"" list released this week. The airport got decent marks across all categories, and its Wi-Fi and cellular signals helped it edge out the competition. Following close behind is New York's JFK International (JFK), whose $800 million Terminal 5 wowed researchers. Delta Air Lines' terminals 2 and 3 at JFK also impressed them, with restaurants that had iPad kiosks to take your order in the gate area and have your food delivered there. Overall, the airport offered more electrical outlets than any other and ""decent"" free Wi-Fi. The country's busiest airport, Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL), came in third place. The electrical outlets available to passengers totaled 1,377, an average 8.1 per gate. No. 20 on the ""best"" list? Oregon's Portland International, which managed to rate in all categories despite what PCWorld called its ""painfully slow (but free) airport Wi-Fi."" PCWorld researchers visited 3,300 gates, testing more than 17,000 electrical outlets, 5,000 USB ports and 1,350 charging stations during an audit of the 40 busiest airports in the United States. Auditors also conducted hundreds of tests of airport Wi-Fi and cellular broadband service. Among the airports that didn't make the top 20 list, Denver International came in last, at No. 40. The exhaustive study took nearly four months and examined the features, or lack thereof, that were common frustrations for tech-savvy travelers. These included the average number of electrical outlets, USB ports, charging stations, Internet kiosks and workspace available per airline gate.

"Washington (CNN) -- A 21-year-old Idaho man charged with trying to assassinate President Obama by firing a rifle at the White House is competent to stand trial, a federal judge ruled Friday. In issuing the ruling, Magistrate Judge John Facciola turned down a request by government prosecutors for Oscar Ortega-Hernandez to undergo more mental evaluation. Dr. Elizabeth Teegarden, a clinical psychologist who interviewed the accused for 50 minutes, told the court she concluded, ""he was clearly competent to stand trial."" Federal prosecutor George Varghese asked Teegarden if she was aware the defendant had referred to himself as a modern-day Jesus Christ and if she knew he reportedly thought the government had a plan to implant global positioning system chips inside U.S. citizens to be able to track them. She said she had not been given that information before she interviewed Ortega-Hernandez. The psychologist said that during the interview, Ortega-Hernandez answered questions about his background, said he had never been treated for a mental illness, and understood the function of the judges and lawyers involved in his case. Teegarden said that when she asked him about comments he had allegedly made to people he knows in Idaho that indicated he might want to hurt Obama, Ortega-Hernandez didn't want to discuss the subject. ""I don't see any delusions in this case that affect competency,"" Teegarden said. ""I saw no delusional thinking, period."" Teegarden, who works for the city's Department of Mental Health, said she does more than 400 mental competency evaluations a year. Ortega-Hernandez sat quietly during the hearing and appeared to listen closely to Teegarden's testimony. He wore a dark prison jumpsuit and leg shackles. He is scheduled to appear in court Monday for a probation and preliminary hearing at which the government is expected to provide probable cause evidence that he fired a rifle at the White House on the evening of November 11 in an attempt to assassinate Obama. Obama was traveling in California the night the shots were fired. On Thursday, the government filed a document arguing Ortega-Hernandez should be kept in jail and not be freed on bail. The filing included details on Ortega-Hernandez's actions on the day of the shooting and in the aftermath. After Ortega-Hernandez was captured in Indiana, Pennsylvania, five days after the shooting, he told investigators he had been carjacked by a man with a gun on the day the White House shooting took place, according to the filing. He allegedly said the man who stole his car and his wallet must have been the person who shot at the White House. Prosecutors say there is videotape showing Ortega-Hernandez shopping at a Walmart store in Fairfax, Virginia, two hours after he said he was robbed in Washington. According to the document, Ortega-Hernandez also said he has never owned a gun. Prosecutors say they have two witnesses from Idaho who contradict that and tie him to a rifle found in a car abandoned not far from the White House on the night of the shooting. One witness said he sold the Romanian-made assault rifle to Ortega-Hernandez last March, and the other said he attached a scope to the weapon and saw Ortega-Hernandez practice shooting with it, according to the court filing. ""Five confirmed bullet impact points"" were found on the south side of the White House, according to the document. Two bullets and one bullet jacket were recovered and prosecutors say preliminary ballistics tests have matched them to the rifle found in a 1998 Honda which is registered to Ortega-Hernandez and another person. Only Ortega-Hernandez's fingerprints were found on some ammunition magazines left in the car and his prints also were found inside the car, according to prosecutors. The government also said a Walmart receipt was found in the car from Ortega-Hernandez's stop there four hours before the shooting. In a criminal complaint issued earlier, several unnamed witnesses were quoted as saying Ortega-Hernandez viewed Obama as ""the devil"" or the ""anti-Christ."" The Thursday filing includes a reference to a woman identified only as ""Witness 10."" She allegedly told investigators that Ortega thought he was ""chosen"" to ""take care of"" the president and that she thought that meant he wanted to kill Obama. Investigators previously released little information on Ortega-Hernandez's movement from the night of the shooting at the White House until he was arrested five days later at a hotel in Pennsylvania. But in their Thursday court filing, prosecutors revealed that three days after the shooting, a former FBI photographer who takes pictures of trains as a hobby photographed a stowaway riding on a train near Shenandoah Junction, West Virginia, heading northwest. The photographer-- identified in the document as witness 18 --thought the man looked like Ortega-Hernandez and contacted law enforcement. Witnesses who knew Ortega-Hernandez later identified the man in the picture as him. Prosecutors say the charge of attempting to assassinate the president is one of the most serious in the criminal code. In the Thursday filing, prosecutors say, ""Ortega-Hernandez was deadly serious about eliminating the president and took many substantial steps toward achieving his end,"" including purchasing a rifle in March to making a 2,000-mile drive from Idaho to the East Coast in October. Prosecutors argue that although Obama wasn't in Washington the night of the shooting, Ortega-Hernandez had a specific plan to hurt him. ""The tragedy that would have befallen the nation if Ortega-Hernandez had been successful is unspeakable,"" prosecutors said.","Judge rules Oscar Ortega-Hernandez is mentally competent .
He will appear in court Monday for a preliminary hearing .
He is accused of firing a rifle at the White House in November .

"(CNN) -- Taryn Davis was 19 when she married her high school sweetheart. ""It was probably the happiest point of my life,"" she said. ""I didn't need someone to complete my life. He made me want to be a better person."" Two days after the wedding, Davis moved to Alaska to be with her husband, Michael Davis, who was stationed at an Army base there, putting their honeymoon plans on hold. ""He wanted to take me to Hawaii,"" she remembered. But they never got to take that trip. On May 21, 2007, Davis came home to find two men waiting to tell her that her husband had been killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq. At 21, Davis was a widow. Consumed by grief, she felt she had nowhere to turn for support. After her husband was deployed to Iraq, Davis moved back home to San Marcos, Texas, away from a military community. ""I didn't live near any bases,"" she said. ""When Michael was killed, I was in my senior year in college. I didn't have a connection to military wives."" But Davis was not alone. Since 2001, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have left 2,829 women without husbands and 46 men without wives, according to a May 2011 report from the Defense Manpower Data Center. ""In the beginning after I lost Michael, I honestly wanted to die,"" she said. ""I wanted someone 21 to say, 'I got the knock on the door. I had the two men who said the words that shattered my world. And I am like you and trying to pick up the pieces.' "" So she made it her mission to seek out other widows. She contacted a widow whose husband was killed alongside hers. ""I gave her a call one day, and I said, 'I want to know all the things that people stopped asking me. I want to know how you met your husband. I want to know how you fell in love, how you were notified, and most importantly, I want to know what makes you get up every day and face life again,' because I didn't know the answers."" Davis found other widows on MySpace and used some of the $100,000 she received in military death benefits to buy video equipment. Then she set out across the country to interview six widows in six different cities. ""It was in the midst of filming that documentary that I got the idea of starting a nonprofit organization that would allow these women to have a place to share all the things that we basically were asking [in the film],"" she said. Four months after Davis' husband was killed, the American Widow Project was born. Since then, more than 750 widows have joined the organization. It started with the website -- a place for young widows to share their stories, learn from one another and find comfort in knowing they're not alone. Then Davis began organizing ""getaway"" trips so the widows could meet in person. The trips have ranged from skydiving out of planes to rebuilding a house damaged by Hurricane Katrina through the St. Bernard Project. Brooke Toner, a widow who helped rebuild the house in New Orleans, said it was hard to find other people who understood what she was going through. ""After Frankie died, I just felt like there was nothing that was going to give me any comfort,"" Toner said. ""I felt like nobody could understand that amount of loss of my best friend, my husband, my soul mate. ""I didn't even think that these women could understand that. But I've been fortunate to meet all of them. They're dealing with so much of it, and they're on a similar path. For me, it's comforting."" Erin Dructor, who also lost her husband, agrees. ""It's opened my eyes to show me different ways on how to be able to handle things to where I feel like I'm not alone,"" she said. ""It's definitely helped me heal more."" For Davis, starting the organization has helped her just as much as it's helping other young widows. ""In the beginning, it was hard for me to even laugh or smile because I thought if people saw me laughing or smiling, they would think that I was over Michael,"" she said. ""In reality, I've learned that when I'm laughing and smiling and I feel most alive is when I feel my husband the most. ""We're all on different journeys. We all have different paths. But to come here on one of our getaways for at least three days and just feel united, feel the love of our husbands and feel the love of our new lives that we're rebuilding together ... that's the thing that gets me through it.""","Taryn Davis founded the American Widow Project after her husband was killed in Iraq .

"(CNN)  -- As a musician and social justice activist, online social media has helped Maria Isa sell more CDs and mobilize the growing number of Latinos in her home city of Minneapolis. Isa wasn't surprised that a study published this summer said Hispanics are among the most active social media users. ""Social media is about accessibility for me,"" Isa said. ""I can send information to my audience with the push of a button on my cell. I'm able to expand my message of social justice in the Latino community and also my work and the works of others who network with me."" There's a growing online audience of people of color. Latinos and African Americans are more than twice as likely to use Twitter as white non-Hispanics, according to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. Much of the reason? Cell phones. Nearly 90% of English speaking Hispanics use mobile devices. But New York Daily News columnist and author Juan Gonzalez said it's an extension of Latino culture. ""I think there's always been a tradition in the Latino culture, a tradition of word spreading news and information, gossip, word of mouth spreading, from family members to friends, neighbors of the same town or whatever,"" Gonzalez said. The growing number of Latinos using social media is a reflection of broader demographic change in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that America's young people will become ""minority white"" in 2023, and by 2042, the same will be true for adults. ""The youth population in America already looks like America will look in a few years. The youth have a stronger identity in their role and purpose,"" Gonzalez said. ""They're already acting out their new role in the country, even before they get to be adults. They're already creating the new America through their involvement in social media."" Map how the United States is changing . Gonzalez, who wrote about the Latino immigrant experience in ""Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America,"" said the success Latinas have online reflects their immigrant experiences. ""Generally speaking, Latina women tend to be more into sharing experiences, and good communicators,"" Gonzalez said. ""I think this is representative of social media and what it represents. It's basically a community talking to each other, spreading bits of information here and there."" Isa was born to Puerto Rican parents in Minneapolis. In her home, it was never a matter of if she was going to college, but where she would go. She chose Columbia College in Chicago, where she focused on social justice and groomed the message she wanted to convey as a musician. Eventually, she took her message online, using Twitter to promote her upcoming shows and projects. She noticed more people at her shows, sold more CDs and generated more traffic to her MySpace music page. In 2010, she was honored by the National Hispana Leadership Institute and a local Univision affiliate. But things really took off when she discovered Latism -- Latinos in Social Media -- a group of like-minded ""gente"" online. With Latism, she found a whole new community of people who wouldn't otherwise notice her work, she said. She was able to educate a larger audience online about what it means to be a Puerto Rican living in the Midwest. The online discussion helped prepare her to better educate her real-life community. Latism was founded in 2009 by Ana Roca-Castro, the chief executive of Premier Social Media. The group started with a simple tweet: ""Where are all my Latinos?"" More than 300 people responded. Now, the organization has grown to more than 140,000 members. ""What happened before, when all these online and social media things started, many people in our community felt like they were sending their thoughts into thin air,"" said Elianne Ramos, the head of communications for the Washington-based organization. ""Through Latism, we give people a place to voice their opinions and talk about the issues that matter to them. A lot of the conversations we have online become initiatives. Our mission is civic empowerment and education."" Every two weeks, the organization is part of a group of 150 Hispanic community leaders on a White House conference call that gives guidance on how to handle issues in the Latino community, Ramos said. ""They explain to us what their plan is, with things like the jobs proposal or Hispanic Heritage Month, and then they take suggestions from us,"" Ramos said. ""You can really say what you think and they really listen. And we always remember the community and keep the community in mind."" Isa said the high numbers of Latinos participating in social media has shown that the communities' issues and passions are more diverse than many realize. ""We keep talking about the Latino community not being monolithic, and it's not,"" Isa said. ""What we're seeing is that Latinos are beginning to embrace every aspect of what being a Latino is."" ""I'm here to reflect the movement that has raised me and continues to happen now. Social media is the number one thing helping me lead that change.""","Study: Latino and black people more likely to use Twitter than non-Hispanic whites .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have issued an arrest warrant for former Dallas Cowboys player Terrell Owens after he failed to show up for a child support hearing last month. The free-agent wide receiver tried to reschedule the October 24 hearing in order to attend an NFL workout to help secure a contract, his spokeswoman said Saturday night. He is ""deeply upset that anyone would misconstrue his nonappearance in court,"" Diana Bianchini said. At the time, Owens did not have representation, but his new attorneys are working to resolve the ""no show"" court date, she said. Owens has been nursing a knee injury after surgery, and currently has no income, according to the spokeswoman. He supports his four children based on his 2007 income of $11 million to $12 million when he was playing for the Dallas Cowboys, which has not been modified to reflect his current situation, she said. ""In addition to this, his attorneys have just filed a lawsuit on his behalf for $2 million in a case where advisers who had access to his accounts were seriously mishandling fund,"" she said. The player is in ""serious financial shape"" but is working to resolve the issue, according to the spokeswoman.

"(CNN) -- France beat heroic 14-man Wales 9-8 in Auckland Saturday to reach the final of the Rugby World Cup. The match was overshadowed by the 18th minute dismissal of Wales captain Sam Warburton for a dangerous tackle. It looked to be a harsh decision by Irish referee Alain Rolland and tipped the match in France's favor although they had to withstand a late Welsh onslaught to maintain their slender lead. Wales had led 3-0 through a James Hook penalty before losing their skipper, but a pair of Morgan Parra penalties put France 6-3 ahead at the interval. He increased that lead to 9-3 with his third penalty early in the second half only for Wales to hit back through a clever solo try by scrum half Mike Phillips. Stephen Jones, a second half replacement for Hook, missed the conversion as it hit the post before Wales had a second chance to take the lead in the closing moments. Fortunate to win a penalty on the halfway line, Leigh Halfpenny's kick was accurate but dipped just under the posts. Wales spent the remainder of the match with the bulk of possession but were unable to work an opening to leave the French to contemplate a final against either hosts New Zealand or Australia who play the second semifinal Sunday on the same ground. But at the end, the main talking point was the crucial red card for Warburton, whose tackle on Vincent Clerc lifted the French wing off his feet as he released a pass. Blog: Why New Zealand must win the World Cup . Rolland believed the infringement merited dismissal rather than a sin-bin offense or warning but former World Cup winning captain Francois Pienaar of South Africa thought otherwise. ""It was a dangerous tackle, yes. Never a red card,"" he told ITV Sport. ""It killed the game,"" he added. Warburton, who could miss next Friday's third place playoff match, was also amazed to have been sent off. ""I'm gutted. There was no malicious intent. I thought it was a normal tackle, the next thing I was walking off into the stands."" Wales have made only one previous appearance in the World Cup semifinals, losing 49-6 to New Zealand in Brisbane in 1987, but also had a man, Huw Richards, sent off in the defeat. French coach Marc Lievremont praised the ""amazingly brave"" Wales, but believed Rolland, the 2007 World Cup final referee, had little choice but to dismiss Warburton. ""I don't care at all whether it was a good match or not, whether the Welsh deserve to be in the final, we have qualified for the final and that's all that counts."" Interest in the opening semifinal was intense and 60,000 fans crammed into the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to watch their Welsh heroes on giant big screens. They trailed away disappointed, but the intensity is set to step up a gear for the clash between Tasman rivals New Zealand and Australia at Eden Park. All Blacks coach Graham Henry believes the match his side's ""biggest in 10 years"" as they bid to win the World Cup for only the second time after a series of near misses. Australia have improved after an opening pool defeat to Ireland, but will be without full-back Kurtley Beale, who has lost his race to be fit for the last four clash.","France beat Wales 9-8 in semifinal of Rugby World Cup in Auckland .

"(CNN) -- Photographer Thomas Nybo has captured images of some of the toughest issues facing Africa, from child mortality to access to education. He recently visited five countries in 11 days as he traveled around West Africa with New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. An experience photographer and filmmaker, Nybo has documented life in more than 65 countries including Sudan, Lebanon, Congo and Yemen. A regular contributor to CNN, he's also worked for other organizations including, the United Nations. While in West African countries including Niger and Burkina Faso, Nybo says no matter people's hardships, he found an unbreakable spirit in everyone that shines through in his pictures. The photographer's favorite image from the trip was of a girl carrying her sister to a health clinic. ""She was fascinated by the camera and followed me around until I took her photo,"" he said. At the same center he met a boy who was carrying his sister on his back. Nybo points out that if you look closely at his eyebrows you can see he is wearing make-up. ""It was the first time I'd seen a boy of his age in Africa wearing make up,"" he added. In another of his pictures Nybo also captured a young woman with facial scarification, a common practice in the area. ""They typically use a razor blade or a sharp knife to carve different patterns in to the skin,"" he explained. One of the toughest places Nybo says he visited was a center for malnutrition in Niger. He photographed a family who were camping outside the building because of the stifling heat inside. At the center he photographed a two-year-old baby who was suffering from measles. The baby was starting to go blind from a vitamin A deficiency but doctors were able to save her in time. Nybo says that everywhere he went he met hard-working mothers; one group in particular that caught his eye had started a community garden to feed their children. Watch the video  to see Thomas Nybo talk about more of the photographs.","Photographer Thomas Nybo recently visited five West African countries .

"New York (CNN) -- Last night, police raided and evicted protesters from the Occupy Wall Street site. This comes on the heels of recent police crackdowns on Occupy encampments all across the country. But if you think that's the end of the 99% movement, guess again. It's still just getting started. To be clear, the Occupy camps are for the most part rigorously and passionately nonviolent and, incidentally, much cleaner than most would expect. But there are a few punks in the crowds, mixed in with some who have sought shelter in the camps who bring along struggles with mental illness or drug addiction. In other words, the 99% movement isn't violent; sadly, our society in general can be violent, and that violence seeps into even the most well-meaning spaces. And enemies of the middle class would use any ammunition they could find to attack the 99% movement and evict the protesters. Nonetheless, the Occupy camps gave urgent birth to a movement that was long-gestating in the anger and frustration of ordinary Americans. Now that it's been kicked out of the house, it's time for the 99% movement to grow up. Movements are, of course, always moving -- and so it's impossible to predict where they will go. But I expect a couple of key shifts in the coming weeks. Judge orders New York to allow protesters, tents, in park . First, look for the 99% movement to move away from the ""occupy"" tactic. Holding public ground for public protests has captured the attention of the nation in a way few other protests ever have. But behind the scenes, protesters were increasingly worried that the problems associated with the camps are starting to outweigh the benefits. Plus it's getting damn cold out and, even in nice weather, the Occupy sites take a lot of energy to maintain. No movement should be beholden to a limited set of tactics. The colonial Americans didn't just keep throwing boxes of tea into bodies of water. The civil rights protesters didn't stop at sit-ins and bus boycotts. Similar to the ""Move Your Money"" campaign calling on the 99% to divest their checking and savings accounts from the top job-killing banks on Wall Street, I think we'll start to see more experimental tactics that draw on mass action and public engagement without necessarily being rooted in outdoor sleepovers. This will be messy at first, with many misses and few hits, but is an essential next step if the 99% movement is to continue. Second, look for leaders to emerge. The Occupy camps have been fervent in their supposedly leaderless structures, frustrating critics and media observers alike. But, as keen analysts have observed, the 99% movement is, in fact, leader-full -- creating opportunities for everyday Americans who've felt cast out of the political process to find their voice and vision and work with others to achieve their goals. The movement isn't anti-leadership but rather pro-leadership to the point where it's investing in building the power and skills of thousands of new leaders. Yet given the practical limitations to an entirely decentralized, consensus-based decision-making process (which, among other things, allows a few vocal yahoos in favor of property destruction to have too much sway), clusters of leaders will start to emerge in the struggle to define the movement's next phase. But don't expect them to look anything like the ""leaders"" we're used to. Instead, they'll include single moms and construction workers and recent college graduates and homeless people. Because of who they are and the way they lead in the context of the larger movement, they will redefine our understanding of leadership. Third, wait for factions to splinter. While we'd all love to keep holding hands and singing ""Kumbaya,"" the reality is that as the 99% movement gets bigger, so do the stakes and various differences and divisions that once seemed trivial become impossible to ignore. The small minority within the protests who are eager to vandalize property and confront police will, let's hope, be sidelined and that their reckless acts will be seen as doing violence to the larger mission of the movement. Of course, it would be great if these small factions could be educated and transformed, but the reality is that in every movement, left and right, there's a fringe and, ultimately, a moment where that fringe is no longer accommodated but rejected. The raids and evictions may be the impetus for this shift in the 99% movement. Whatever happens next, it's clear that the movement to make our economy and political system work for the 99% has barely completed the first 1% of its long and vital journey. You can evict protesters, but you can never evict a growing idea. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Despite crackdowns, the Occupy movement is just getting started, says Sally Kohn .
Look for the movement to shift away from the ""occupy"" tactic, Kohn predicts .
Kohn: Watch for leaders to emerge, despite the movement being ""leaderless""
The movement's violent fringes will probably soon be sidelined, says Kohn ."
"(CNN) -- Details were just beginning to emerge Thursday on plans for memorial services and other tributes to Steve Jobs, the iconic Apple co-founder who died Wednesday. But if plans for official observances were still forming, people across the world touched by his vision, and the products that resulted, were already clamoring for ways to celebrate and memorialize his legacy. A statement from Jobs' family late Wednesday said a website is going to be created ""for those who wish to offer tributes and memories."" While saying ""we know many of you will mourn with us,"" the statement did not mention any plans for a public memorial service. Early Thursday, that website did not appear to be live yet. A spokeswoman for the family did not immediately respond to a request for details. In its statement announcing the CEO's death, Apple provided an email address -- rememberingsteve@apple.com -- for people wishing to ""share your thoughts, memories, and condolences."" Apple has said the company does not know when, or if, there will be a public memorial. But at Apple's headquarters, Apple stores worldwide and on the Internet, unofficial tributes had already begun. On Apple's campus in Cupertino, California, flags were at half-staff and an impromptu memorial had cropped up by late Wednesday. Apple employees and others showed up to leave flowers, light candles and provide other tributes. Apple retail stores everywhere became gathering places for the Apple faithful who looked at Jobs as much more than a CEO. At an Apple store in Tokyo, iPads and iPhones showing flickering images of candles had been propped beside flowers and other more traditional items. Online, a pre-existing group of Apple fans had already declared October 14, the day the iPhone 4S will be released, ""Steve Jobs Day"" as a tribute to his legacy. ""We admire his work. We've embraced his vision. And we love what he's brought to the world,"" reads the group's website. ""Let's take a day to honor the man himself and say thank you."" The site encourages people to dress in Jobs' iconic jeans and black mock turtleneck on that day, and use Facebook and Twitter to share thoughts about him. ""We planned this the day he retired and announced it in September,"" the group wrote on a Facebook page where people can RSVP to ""attend"" the day. ""It was intended to be a celebration of his life. Not a memorial."" On Thursday morning, more than 7,000 people had said they would participate. Tech-focused publications, including BoingBoing and Wired, also turned their website homepages into tributes to Jobs. BoingBoing's site was reskinned to look like an older Mac computer interface. Wired made most of its page black in reverence for the passing of a tech titan.","Early Thursday, details on tributes to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs were still scarce .

"(CNN) -- A Colombian man, possibly linked with paramilitaries there, may be the mastermind behind the kidnapping in Venezuela of major league catcher Wilson Ramos, Venezuelan Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami said Saturday. Authorities have identified him and an arrest warrant is being issued, he said. Six Venezuelans have been arrested in the case, and more arrests are possible as the investigation continues, El Aissami said. Ramos was rescued Friday night after a shootout between his suspected captors and rescuers in the mountainous region of Montalban, about 60 miles from the north central Venezuelan city where he was last seen. He is healthy and unharmed, authorities said. After the suspected captors opened fire on authorities, ""we responded in a proportional way, but not in a way that would put at risk (Ramos') rescue,"" El Aissami said at a news conference. The minister praised the bravery of the national guard troops who participated in the operation, singling out one guardsman who was under fire for several minutes ""but did not retreat."" The day after Ramos went missing, investigators found the SUV used in the kidnapping, but had few clues to lead them to the perpetrators, he said. So investigators focused on intelligence work -- matching the description of the snatching to the modus operandi of known criminal groups -- and eventually located a home where they believed Ramos was held. Venezuelan President Chavez himself authorized the operation on the house, which included using helicopters to deliver the rescue team near its target, El Aissami said. This house was, the team learned, a logistical base used by the kidnappers. According to the minister, it was the place where food and other logistics were prepared and then transferred to another location, where Ramos was actually being held. The owners of the home, Lesbia Quesada, 60, and Aristides Sanchez, 64, were accused of being accomplices to the crime and were arrested, he said. The rescue team then learned of a second home in an isolated area where Ramos was believed to be hiding. The trek there took three hours for the rescue team, as there were parts they could traverse only on foor, El Aissami said. When they neared the second target, they were met with gunfire, and, according to the minister, that's how they knew Ramos was inside. Authorities arrested Alexander Sanchez, 27; Francisco Finamor Penna, 20; Yosnar Cubillan, 21; and Anyuli Tarazona, 22. But it was a Colombian man, possibly linked to paramilitaries, who gave the orders, El Aissami said. This man identified Ramos, got the information on his home, located his relatives and gave the orders to carry out the kidnapping, El Aissami said. Ramos was full of thanks to his rescuers and his supporters upon his arrival at his family home in Venezuela early Saturday. ""I am very happy for the rescue operation they carried out. Very thankful to the government and the national army,"" Ramos told reporters. ""I didn't expect them. Where they were holding me captive was a very remote place, basically a jungle, and see, I was praying to God to bring me home safely to my family and look at these guys, they risked their lives to save mine and I am very thankful."" Ramos, a rising star for the Washington Nationals as a rookie this past year, was in his native country to play in Venezuela's winter league. Washington Nationals officials applauded the news of his rescue. ""I am happy to announce that I have spoken directly with Wilson and he assures me he is unharmed,"" said Mike Rizzo, the team's general manager. ""He asked me to thank all who played a role in his rescue, and all those who kept him and his family in their thoughts and prayers."" Ramos, 24, emerged as the team's top catcher this past season. He had a .267 batting average with 15 home runs and 52 runs batted in. Though soccer reigns in most Latin American countries, baseball rules in Venezuela, which routinely feeds players to major league teams in the United States.","NEW: Six people have been arrested in connection with the kidnapping .

"(CNN) -- Pennsylvania needs to change its law in the wake of a scandal over alleged child sexual abuse by a then-member of Penn State's football coaching team, the governor said Sunday. A new law is needed to make sure reports of alleged child sexual abuse are made to government authorities, Tom Corbett said. ""Should the law be changed? Absolutely,"" Corbett said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Corbett was the attorney general who began an investigation of former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. A 23-page grand jury report released last weekend described crimes that Sandusky allegedly committed against young boys between 1994 and 2009 -- some of them on campus, both during and after his tenure at at Penn State. Sandusky's attorney, Joseph Amendola, has said that his client disputes the report. In 2002, a graduate assistant allegedly saw Sandusky raping a boy in the showers of a campus athletics facility. The graduate student, Mike McQueary, informed Joe Paterno, the team's coach at the time, according to the grand jury report. Paterno then alerted his boss, the school's athletic director. It was years before law enforcement first learned about the allegation. Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz have been charged for failing to report the abuse to authorities and misleading investigators. Prosecutors determined that a legal duty to report the alleged abuse applied to them, but not to McQueary and Paterno. Members of both political parties ""have already introduced measures"" to change the law, Corbett said when asked about Paterno. ""And we have to make sure that the change in the law is one that is effective. It's easy enough to take a look to see what other states have done. But I'm sure that within the next few weeks, you will probably see bills become public. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see if a bill was passed between now and the end of this year,"" he said. McQueary, who was later promoted to a full-time assistant coach, eventually described the alleged incident in graphic detail to the grand jury. He was placed on administrative leave Friday. The grand jury report says that Schultz and Curley were ""senior staff"" of the university. ""Pennsylvania's mandatory reporting statute for suspected child abuse ... provides that when a staff member reports abuse ... the person in charge of the school or institution has the responsibility and legal obligation to report or cause such a report to be made by telephone and in writing within 48 hours"" to the Department of Public Welfare, according to the report. ""An oral report should have been made to the Centre County Children and Youth Services,"" it said. Pennsylvania's Child Protective Services Law states that anyone who, in the course of employment, ""comes into contact with children shall report or cause a report to be made ... when the person has reasonable cause to suspect"" that the child is a victim of abuse. The law states that when the person is required to report ""as a member of the staff of a medical or other public or private institution, school, facility or agency, that person shall immediately notify the person in charge."" The person in charge ultimately has the responsibility to report the alleged incident to government authorities. Jerry McHugh, a prominent Philadelphia attorney who represents victims of abuse but is not currently representing anyone involved in the Penn State scandal, told CNN Sunday a new law is needed to state that ""if you eyewitness the abuse, you have a direct obligation to go to law enforcement."" Legal analyst Holly Hughes told CNN that when Paterno told his boss and no report was given to the authorities, ""that is where they failed. That's where they fall down on the job."" There is also speculation that Pennsylvania's whistle-blower laws may apply to, and protect, McQueary. Legal analyst and civil rights attorney Avery Friedman said the case highlights the need for ""a re-examination of what is called the mandatory reporter law."" ""The argument being advanced in Pennsylvania is that as long as you tell the boss, you're covered. And that's where -- I think if we zero in on the issue -- where the problem is. If victims are going to be protected, you have to go to law enforcement, and that didn't happen here,"" Friedman said. Outside of the legal concerns, many question why McQueary did not stop what he allegedly saw happening in the showers in 2002. ""How does McQueary, a 28-year-old grad student, look in the showers of a facility and see a grown man raping a 10-year-old child and not instinctively grab a baseball bat and not protect this child? How does he live with himself?"" asked Richard Hermann, legal analyst and criminal defense attorney. Before announcing his administrative leave, the university said McQueary would not coach Penn State's Saturday football game against Nebraska due to ""multiple threats."" The newspaper Patriot-News reported Friday that McQueary told players on a brief conference call that he was in ""protective custody"" at a secluded location. Paterno, meanwhile, was fired last week. The school's Board of Trustees also ousted Graham Spanier, the school president, who had initially voiced support for Curley and Schultz following the release of the grand jury report. Corbett, who now serves as a trustee on the Penn State board, made the rounds on three Sunday political talk shows, though he cautioned that his comments were limited by legal obligations due to the ongoing investigation. Asked by ""Fox News Sunday"" how the school could have allowed Sandusky's alleged activities to continue for years, Corbett said, ""What I saw was a failure to act, and I always have said your actions speak louder than your words."" GOP presidential hopeful Rep. Michelle Bachmann, who happened to appear on ""Meet the Press"" after Corbett, was asked about the scandal. ""If that was my child,"" she said of the allegations, her ""automatic reaction would be, even though I'm a small woman, I'd want to go find that guy and beat him to a pulp."" But Bachmann said the case belongs within the state's jurisdiction, and that she does not see a role for Congress in the response. On Saturday, tens of thousands packed Penn State's football stadium, cheering the Nittany Lions for the first time since the graphic allegations rocked the university and led to the ouster of longtime coach Paterno, who until days ago was a beloved school icon and the winningest coach in top-level college football history. Penn State lost to Nebraska 17-14. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: A new law should require a witness to tell law enforcement, a Pennsylvania legal expert says .

"(CNN) -- Iraq scored in injury time Friday to beat 10-man China 1-0 and all but end their opponent's hopes of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup finals. The Asia Group A match in Doha was a mirror image of the side's earlier clash in China a month ago, with Younis Mahmoud, who scored the only goal in Shenzhen, coming up trumps again in injury time. China were handicapped by a red card for Zhang Linpeng and paid for missed chances. Iraq, coached by former Brazil legend Zico, have moved into a strong position in the qualifying section, which is led by Jordan, who confirmed their place in the second stage by beating Singapore 2-0. Jose Camacho's China would have to win their final two games and see Iraq lose by a heavy margin to Jordan and Singapore to claim an unlikely second in the group. ""China played bravely, but we won the match and the result has almost guaranteed our place in the last ten,"" Zico told the official FIFA website. ""The game went as we predicted. We knew China would attack, so we focused on defending in the first half before sealing victory late on."" Japan and Uzbekistan joined Jordan in clinching qualification Friday, continuing their domination of Group C. Japan routed Tajikistan 4-0 and Uzbekistan beat North Korea 1-0 with Timur Kapadze scoring the only goal of the match for the hosts. The big surprise of the day was the 1-0 defeat for Group D leaders Australia in Oman with Amad Ali scoring the winner in the 18th minute. Australia will still be expected to progress after four earlier wins, with Frank Rijkaard's Saudi Arabia moving into second in the group after a 3-0 win over Thailand. In Group B, South Korea stayed top by beating the UAE 2-0 and Mahmoud El Ali grabbed the only goal of the game as Lebanon shocked hosts Kuwait 1-0 to move into second. Iran held on to top spot in Group E but needed an injury-time equalizer from Mojtaba Jabari to scramble a 1-1 draw in Bahrain. Iran lead Qatar, who recorded a 4-0 home win over Indonesia, on goal difference. In the first round of African qualifying, the outstanding result Friday was 3-1 win for the Congo DR in Swaziland with Togo held 1-1 in Guinea Bissau. Totttenham's Emmanuel Adebayor is set to return for Togo in the second leg next Tuesday. A star-studded Argentina side were held to a disappointing 1-1 home draw by Bolivia in their third match of qualifying from South America. Argentina, boasting the likes of Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain, found the visitors hard to break down and even fell behind as Martins Moreno scored in the second half. It needed an equalizer from Ezequiel Lavezzi to salvage a point, with Argentina booed from the field.","Iraq score last-gasp winner to beat China 1-0 in World Cup qualifying .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Toshiba said Tuesday it will no longer manufacture HD DVDs, effectively ending the long-running battle with the rival Blu-ray for a dominant high-definition format. People watch a demonstration of HD DVD at the 2008 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Toshiba said it made the decision to cease developing, manufacturing, and marketing HD DVDs after ""recent major changes in the market."" It promised to continue offering support and service for all existing Toshiba HD DVD products. ""We carefully assessed the long-term impact of continuing the so-called 'next-generation format war' and concluded that a swift decision will best help the market develop,"" Toshiba President and Chief Executive Atsutoshi Nishida said in a news release. Toshiba's HD DVD business has been suffering recently with a string of major retailers and rental companies announcing their preference for Blu-ray, developed by Sony.  Watch video on the battle of the formats Â» . Last week alone, Wal-Mart and online rental company Netflix said they would abandon HD in favor of Blu-ray. Last month, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment -- which had been the largest media company releasing videos in both formats -- announced it would offer DVDs solely in Blu-ray. The DVD battle has been reminiscent of the VHS vs. Beta fight in the early 1980s. It has left many consumers confused and waiting to see which technology will emerge as the industry standard. Sony's Blu-ray is backed by Disney, 20th Century Fox, MGM, Dell, Panasonic, and Philips. Toshiba's HD DVD is backed by Paramount, Universal Pictures, Microsoft, Sanyo, and NEC. Toshiba said it would continue to work with those companies and study ways to collaborate with them in the future. Tens of billions of dollars have been at stake as major movie studios battled for a dominant format. But rival game consoles have been part of the struggle, too -- Sony's Playstation 3 plays Blu-ray discs, while the Microsoft Xbox will play HD DVDs if users install an add-on component. Both Blu-ray and HD are high-definition DVDs, the successor to ordinary DVDs which show pictures only in standard definition. But Blu-ray and HD involve different hardware and are not compatible with each other, meaning consumers have had to decide which system to invest in. Both formats have an excellent picture quality with a large storage space. But Toshiba has lost the battle because it lacks a retail presence in many markets, said Carl Gressum, a senior analyst at Ovum, a London technology consultancy. ""They didn't manage to bring on board some of the China vendors, they didn't bring (on board) the retailers, they've failed to develop in the European and Asian markets,"" Gressum told CNN. Warner Brothers announced its decision to drop HD DVD right before last month's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a significant event for corporate buyers. Gressum said that led to an immediate drop in retail support for Toshiba's format. Gressum said manufacturers of both formats have made things more difficult for retailers by forcing consumers to make a choice between the gradually-dominant Blu-ray and the much-cheaper HD. ""They're losing money in many cases because of the price war between the two formats as Toshiba -- and also Microsoft, to a certain extent -- has been playing the price card for HD DVD players,"" he said. Toshiba said the company would continue to market standard DVD players and recorders. E-mail to a friend .","Toshiba says it will no longer make or market HD DVD players and recorders .

"(CNN) -- Malawi welcomed Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for a regional trade meeting Thursday over the objections of the International Criminal Court and human rights activists. Al-Bashir is wanted by the court in The Hague, Netherlands, for alleged war crimes. He arrived in Malawi for the annual summit of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). Human Rights Watch had urged Malawi authorities to arrest al-Bashir or ban his entry into the country. Malawi ratified the Rome Statute, which created the court, and as such, it is obliged to arrest him. ""Al-Bashir is an international fugitive wanted on charges of genocide and other heinous crimes committed in Darfur,"" said Elise Keppler, international justice senior counsel at Human Rights Watch. ""As an International Criminal Court member, Malawi should arrest him, not host him."" The court issued a warrant for al-Bashir for alleged crimes in the troubled region of Darfur in March, 2009. Human Rights Watch said a number of al-Bashir's anticipated visits to both member and non-member countries have been canceled following public outcry. However, last year, Kenya allowed al-Bashir into the country to attend the signing ceremonies for Kenya's new constitution. The government defended its decision not to arrest al-Bashir by saying Kenya's first obligation was to the African Union, not the International Criminal Court. The European Union foreign policy chief also expressed concern over the visit. ""The European Union is a staunch supporter of the ICC and the fight against impunity,"" Catherine Ashton said in a statement Friday. ""The Court is a valuable instrument of the international community to ensure that there is no impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern; genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes must not go unpunished and their prosecution must be ensured by measures at both domestic and international level.""","Human Rights Watch urged Malawai to arrest Omar al-Bashir .

"(CNN) -- The woman who accused Herman Cain of groping her after a 1997 dinner says the Republican presidential candidate is ""still in denial"" about his conduct. Sharon Bialek is the first woman to publicly accuse Cain of sexual harassment after last week's disclosure that the National Restaurant Association -- which Cain led in the late 1990s -- made payments to two other women who complained about his conduct. Cain has vehemently denied any allegation of misconduct. Bialek told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" that she came forward Monday ""for the other women who couldn't or wouldn't."" ""I really hope that what I did will enable other women to come forward in similar situations,"" Bialek said. ""Unfortunately for Herman, he's still in denial.""

"(CNN) -- Birders define ""a big year"" as an informal competition to see who can spot the most species of birds in a certain area in a calendar year. Let me start off with a disclaimer: I am a bit of a bird nerd. Not a serious birder by any stretch (I have never gone on vacation specifically for the birds, for example ... well, not a long one, anyway), but my iPhoto has been known to contain more than a few shots of birds, and my iPhone does have iBird Explorer Plus. Oh, and as a child, my dad and I would spend the occasional summer afternoon in the country listening to records of bird calls. However, just because I like birds doesn't mean I am predisposed to liking a movie with a lot of birds in it. I am a huge baseball fan too, but am perfectly able to recognize a bad baseball movie when I see one. ""Major League 2,"" anyone? In addition, a good film needs to have something to it in addition to the surface subject matter. What I am trying to say is, just because this is a film about birding doesn't mean it's a film about birding. Stu Preissler (Steve Martin), Brad Harris (Jack Black) and Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson) are three birders who may (or may not) be attempting a Big Year. The thing is, it's such a competitive field that those attempting such a feat tend to keep the information to themselves, so as to not inspire the competition. Paying possum is a big part of a Big Year. The head of a corporation, Stu is nearing retirement age. He wants to quit the rat race, do something for himself (A Big Year, natch) and settle down in Colorado with his wife, Edith (JoBeth Williams). Of course his corporate underlings, smarmily played by Kevin Pollak and Joel McHale, continuously try to pull him off the road and into the board room. Brad, in his mid-30s and divorced, is low on funds and morale. He's stuck in a job he hates and aches to do something truly great. As a birder, this means breaking the world record held by Bostick (almost always referred to by his surname with a mix of derision, awe and envy by his fellow birders). For Stu and Brad, while the undertaking of a Big Year is exciting, it's also a means to an end, not the end itself, and the journey is at least as important as the result. One of the joys of this film is watching their excitement when some El NiÃÂ±o weather phenomena means that there's a likelihood of a mass of grounded birds (a storm in Florida) or a super rare sighting (a pink-footed goose, rarely seen in the U.S.). To the arrogant and absurdly colorfully attired Bostick, however, the Big Year is personal and more about him than it is about the birds. It's his record, and his status as world champion is more important to him than anything, even his devoted wife, Jessica (Rosamund Pike). Bostick is constantly promising to hang up his binoculars and start a family, only to receive a call with a rare bird sighting somewhere across the country and hit the road again. Stu and Brad quickly become friends and repeatedly run into each other throughout the year in far-flung parts of the continent, and travel they do. ""The Big Year"" takes them from Maine to Key West to Arizona to Attu Island, Alaska, the westernmost island in the Aleutians, closer to Russia than it is to the Alaskan mainland (of course the production didn't actually shoot there, but they did shoot in the Yukon). The scenery and wildlife on display are at times breathtaking. The thing is (up on my avian soapbox, again), I can see the appeal. After all, birds are amazing creatures. They can fly, which is amazing in and of itself, and oh, by the way, isn't one of the most common dreams the one where you're flying? Add to that their place in evolution, their diversity, strength and behavioral differences, and they're pretty interesting creatures. While it's mostly about the humans in the cast, the sheer number of birds on display (stay for the running list during the closing credits) is astonishing, with some quite interesting (and in one case downright touching) bits of bird trivia thrown in. It's not hard to see how large groups of people could get caught up in the activity. In fact, a 2006 survey by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department puts the number of birders nationwide at 48 million. That same year, the activity created 671,000 jobs and added $36 billion to the U.S. economy. At the heart of ""The Big Year"" is the idea that we all have our passions, and why are any passions any weirder than any other? Surely, on a list of odd obsessions, birding ranks far below hoarding or, say, dyeing your dog to look like a panda. Supporting turns are all solid, with special notice to the always lovely Rashida Jones as Ellie, the female bird nerd who captures Brad's interest, and Anjelica Huston as the comically and aptly named Annie Auklet. Dianne Weist and Brian Dennehy are perfectly cast as Brad's parents. If there's ever been a non-related trio that looks more like a real family, I'll eat my special birding hat. Kidding. I don't have one ... yet. ""The Big Year"" is a charming, uplifting and heartwarming film, and when it's funny (which is often), it's very funny indeed. It has a simple but compelling story to which everyone, birders and non-, can relate, great chemistry between Martin and Black, and a heart. It's nice to see a film that doesn't have a mean streak and also doesn't talk to adults like they are idiots. ""The Big Year"" is rated PG. There's a minor swear word or two, but that's about it.","""The Big Year"" stars Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson .

"(CNN) -- Roman Abramovich is seeking to buy back Chelsea's home ground in order to switch to a new location that he hopes will help the English Premier League club remain competitive on an international scale. Stamford Bridge, which dates back to 1876, once hosted a crowd of almost 83,000 people. But many decades since that 1935 landmark, its capacity is now only 41,841 -- having been converted into an all-seater venue in the safety-conscious 1990s . However, ownership of the stadium was given to a fans' collective long before billionaire Abramovich bought the west London club in 2003, in order to fight off the prospect it would again be bought by property developers. The terms of the deal which eventually sold Stamford Bridge to Chelsea Pitch Owners (CPO) in 1999, a move that required a ÃÂ£10 million ($15 million) loan from the club, meant the team cannot keep its name if it relocates. Can football chants ever go too far? ""We know only too well how close the club came to losing our home prior to the formation of CPO, but that threat has now gone under Mr. Abramovich's ownership,"" Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck told the club's website. ""And with the CPO structure in place, we cannot plan with certainty for the future. I hope all shareholders vote in favor of the proposal."" The CPO members will make their decision at a special meeting on October 27 that will have a massive bearing on Chelsea's future plans. With the introduction of UEFA's financial fairplay rules looming, Chelsea's need to maximize revenue and become less dependent on the club's Russian benefactor is growing. Premier League rivals Manchester United can entertain more than 75,000 fans at every home game, while Arsenal's Emirates Stadium holds some 60,000. Bigger grounds are seen as the way ahead, with Tottenham recently losing out to West Ham in a bitterly-contested bid to take over London's new Olympic Stadium after 2012. However, English clubs have some way to go before catching their European rivals. Barcelona's Camp Nou has the continent's largest capacity at almost 100,000 while Spanish rivals Real Madrid top 85,000 at the Santiago Bernabeu. Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park is the biggest football ground in Germany with a capacity of 80,000 for domestic matches, while Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena regularly brings in almost 70,000. In Italy, the two Milan clubs can draw crowds of 80,000 -- though Juventus bucked the trend by moving to a smaller 41,000-capacity ground this season, leaving behind the unpopular 60,000-plus Stadio delle Alpi. Success in Europe's biggest club competition, the Champions League, still eludes Abramovich despite the vast fortune he has pumped into Chelsea. A move to a new venue -- which would be within a three-mile radius of the club's current home if completed by 2020, under terms of the offer to the CPO -- would be a big statement of his desire to make Chelsea a worldwide force. ""I am sure all Chelsea fans have enjoyed the football and success we have witnessed at Stamford Bridge since 2003, and Chelsea Football Club and Mr. Abramovich are determined to ensure that the club continues to compete at the highest level of world football,"" chief executive Ron Gourlay said. ""We continue to look at options for expanding the Bridge, and I should be clear that we have not identified a site for a new stadium elsewhere."" Chelsea's offer to the CPO's 12,000 stakeholders is at the original price of ÃÂ£100 per share -- an investment of ÃÂ£1.5 million. ""Bear in mind that no-one bought these shares as a financial investment,"" Buck told the UK Press Association. ""Everyone bought these shares as a way of helping the club and they also bought them as mementos and souvenirs. ""We haven't considered making them a big offer because we believe that they are fans of Chelsea Football Club and want to do what's best for Chelsea."" On offer is a promise that 10% of the planned minimum 55,000 seats will be available to families and fans aged under 21. CPO shareholders who vote for the sale will be listed on a roll of honor at any new stadium, and would get priority for buying season tickets. The Chelsea Supporters' Club, however, is not convinced that the club should leave its longtime home. ""Where is the proof that Stamford Bridge can't be expanded? Undoubtedly many fans would prefer to stay, and I suspect loss of hotels/restaurants would not be a major concern for many,"" Peter T. wrote in a statement on its website. ""The 'walk of honor' proposal is risible and insulting. Given that any new ground would be bigger, the 'priority season ticket' offer is surely nebulous as well, as well as morally reprehensible."" He also questioned why the vote had been called at such short notice, without any future venues being identified, and why the offer did not take into account inflation since the original 1993 CPO deal. Needing a 50% majority approval from the CPO shareholders, Abramovich may yet find more obstacles in his dreams of world domination.","Chelsea's owner seeking to buy back Stamford Bridge so club can move .

"(WIRED) -- A computer virus has infected the cockpits of America's Predator and Reaper drones, logging pilots' every keystroke as they remotely fly missions over Afghanistan and other warzones. The virus, first detected nearly two weeks ago by the military's Host-Based Security System, has not prevented pilots at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada from flying their missions overseas. Nor have there been any confirmed incidents of classified information being lost or sent to an outside source. But the virus has resisted multiple efforts to remove it from Creech's computers, network security specialists say. And the infection underscores the ongoing security risks in what has become the U.S. military's most important weapons system. ""We keep wiping it off, and it keeps coming back,"" says a source familiar with the network infection, one of three that told Danger Room about the virus. ""We think it's benign. But we just don't know."" Military network security specialists aren't sure whether the virus and its so-called ""keylogger"" payload were introduced intentionally or by accident; it may be a common piece of malware that just happened to make its way into these sensitive networks. The specialists don't know exactly how far the virus has spread. But they're sure that the infection has hit both classified and unclassified machines at Creech. That raises the possibility, at least, that secret data may have been captured by the keylogger, and then transmitted over the public internet to someone outside the military chain of command. Drones have become America's tool of choice in both its conventional and shadow wars, allowing U.S. forces to attack targets and spy on its foes without risking American lives. Since President Obama assumed office, a fleet of approximately 30 CIA-directed drones have hit targets in Pakistan more than 230 times; all told, these drones have killed more than 2,000 suspected militants and civilians, according to the Washington Post. More than 150 additional Predator and Reaper drones, under U.S. Air Force control, watch over the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. American military drones struck 92 times in Libya between mid-April and late August. And late last month, an American drone killed top terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki -- part of an escalating unmanned air assault in the Horn of Africa and southern Arabian peninsula. But despite their widespread use, the drone systems are known to have security flaws. Many Reapers and Predators don't encrypt the video they transmit to American troops on the ground. In the summer of 2009, U.S. forces discovered ""days and days and hours and hours"" of the drone footage on the laptops of Iraqi insurgents. A $26 piece of software allowed the militants to capture the video. The lion's share of U.S. drone missions are flown by Air Force pilots stationed at Creech, a tiny outpost in the barren Nevada desert, 20 miles north of a state prison and adjacent to a one-story casino. In a nondescript building, down a largely unmarked hallway, is a series of rooms, each with a rack of servers and a ""ground control station,"" or GCS. There, a drone pilot and a sensor operator sit in their flight suits in front of a series of screens. In the pilot's hand is the joystick, guiding the drone as it soars above Afghanistan, Iraq, or some other battlefield. Some of the GCSs are classified secret, and used for conventional warzone surveillance duty. The GCSs handling more exotic operations are top secret. None of the remote cockpits are supposed to be connected to the public internet. Which means they are supposed to be largely immune to viruses and other network security threats. But time and time again, the so-called ""air gaps"" between classified and public networks have been bridged, largely through the use of discs and removable drives. In late 2008, for example, the drives helped introduce the agent.btz worm to hundreds of thousands of Defense Department computers. The Pentagon is still disinfecting machines, three years later. Use of the drives is now severely restricted throughout the military. But the base at Creech was one of the exceptions, until the virus hit. Predator and Reaper crews use removable hard drives to load map updates and transport mission videos from one computer to another. The virus is believed to have spread through these removable drives. Drone units at other Air Force bases worldwide have now been ordered to stop their use. In the meantime, technicians at Creech are trying to get the virus off the GCS machines. It has not been easy. At first, they followed removal instructions posted on the website of the Kaspersky security firm. ""But the virus kept coming back,"" a source familiar with the infection says. Eventually, the technicians had to use a software tool called BCWipe to completely erase the GCS' internal hard drives. ""That meant rebuilding them from scratch"" -- a time-consuming effort. The Air Force declined to comment directly on the virus. ""We generally do not discuss specific vulnerabilities, threats, or responses to our computer networks, since that helps people looking to exploit or attack our systems to refine their approach,"" says Lt. Col. Tadd Sholtis, a spokesman for Air Combat Command, which oversees the drones and all other Air Force tactical aircraft. ""We invest a lot in protecting and monitoring our systems to counter threats and ensure security, which includes a comprehensive response to viruses, worms, and other malware we discover."" However, insiders say that senior officers at Creech are being briefed daily on the virus. ""It's getting a lot of attention,"" the source says. ""But no one's panicking. Yet.""

"Seattle (CNN) -- Self-styled superhero Phoenix Jones unmasked himself before cameras Thursday and vowed to keep fighting crime after prosecutors delayed a decision on whether to press assault charges against him. Jones -- who told reporters his real name is Ben Fodor -- routinely patrols downtown Seattle streets decked out in a rubber suit and mask. He was arrested early Sunday on four counts of assault after police said he used pepper spray on a group of people leaving a nightclub. A spokesman for Fodor said he was trying to break up a fight. Video shot by a documentary crew and posted on Phoenix Jones' Facebook page showed a chaotic scene, with the self-styled super hero being chased by a purse-wielding woman and then shooting what appeared to be pepper spray at a group of people. Fodor was the only person arrested in the incident. Seattle Police said Fodor overreacted, and asserted that the city is not in need of vigilante crime fighters. ""If you see something that warrants calling 911, call 911. You don't need to dress up in a costume to do that,"" police spokesman Mark Jamieson said. In court Thursday, Fodor appeared wearing a hood, which a judge's assistant asked him to remove. Told charges had not been filed against him, Fodor put the rubber hood back on and left the court with a swarm of media cameras following him. Outside the courthouse, Fodor told reporters he would continue his anti-crime patrols and then removed his hood. ""In addition to being Phoenix Jones,"" he said. ""I am also Ben Fodor, a father and brother. I am just like everybody else. The only difference is that I try to stop crime."" Fodor also said he would invite the public to accompany him on future patrols. He then walked off without taking any questions from reporters. An Internet search showed Fodor has competed in mixed martial arts events, with a record of 11 wins and no losses. Kimberly Mills, a spokeswoman for the city attorney's office, said prosecutors will decide whether to file charges against him after they finish interviewing witnesses and complete the investigation into the incident Sunday.","Superhero Phoenix Jones is revealed to be the alter ego of Ben Fodor .

"(CNN) -- The morning three women won the Nobel Peace Prize, Jody Williams was tired from a night spent strategizing about how to stop rape and other sexual violence toward women in war. Williams won the prize in 1997 for her work to ban land mines. Thursday night, she'd joined other female Nobel winners and peace advocates in New York. They belong to a group associated with the Nobel WomenÃÂ¹s Initiative, founded in 2006 by female laureates and activists. As the news broke Friday about the 2011 winners, Williams was just getting out of bed. ""My husband is already on his computer, and I hear him say, 'Woah! Three women!' "" Williams rushed to him and peered at the monitor. She read the names. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, activist Leymah Gbowee of Liberia and rights activist Tawakkul Karman of Yemen. On television, a Nobel official explained the decision to award the prize jointly. The women were chosen ""for their nonviolent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights ... ""We cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence development of all levels of society,"" he said. Williams was thrilled. She knows Gbowee, she said, and loved that the Nobel Peace Prize was being given to three women, raising the total number of women who have individually won the prize to 15, according to the prize's official site. Only nine Nobel Peace Laureates are still living, according to the Nobel Women's Initiative. ""Leymah is incredibly powerful and sure of herself,"" Williams told CNN.com. ""She has no trouble dealing with the media. I can imagine she is stunned and yet excited and recognizes how much this changes what she does."" Williams was startled in 1997 when she got the call that she had won. Looking out her window at 5 a.m. that day in October, she saw reporters camped out on her gravel driveway in Vermont. Though she knew she was on the Nobel Peace Prize short list, she hadn't believed she would win. Williams assumed the award would go to more prominent people within the organization where she worked. As an introvert, she said, she was worried. But she managed to do interview after interview that day. The spotlight hasn't dimmed as time has passed. ""It was a lot of attention all at once, which was hard for me personally, but it was incredible for the campaign and that was the important thing,"" she said. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines launched in 1992 with six nongovernmental organizations and grew to more than 1,000 NGOs in more than 60 countries. Within six years, Williams told CNN.com, the campaign succeeded in getting an international treaty banning the weapons. The campaign worked with government, United Nations bodies and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The agreement came during the diplomatic conference in Oslo, Norway, in September 1997. She was awarded the Nobel a month later. Williams predicts that the Nobel Prize awarded to two relatively unknown female activists will put more focus on democratic uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. And it will make Karman a visual representation of the Arab Spring. ""That is going to be totally intense,"" Williams said. ""But it's awesome."" It will be impossible for these Nobel Peace Prize winners and the women they represent to be tamped down or forgotten or told what to do as the movements in their countries unfold and slowly resolve, Williams said. ""You can't have them go back into the kitchen once they've overthrown the dictator,"" Williams said. Giving the Nobel Prize to all the women at once signals a declaration of sorts to the world. It says: We're not going back. We are stronger in numbers. Sharing the prize, as two Irish peace activists have in the past, does not diminish the honor, Williams stressed. She has heard criticism to that point and believes it's important to quash that mentality. ""They were jointly recognized because each of them has done significant work nonviolently to being about democratic change to stop violence against women,"" Williams said. Women tend to work together, she added. It seems fitting that they share the prize. Williams offered advice to the women who won Friday: Remain true to yourself, she said. ""These women wouldn't have been recognized if they were not really clear about who they are, what they believe and what they are willing to do to demonstrate their belief through action.""","1997 Peace Prize winner Jody Williams was thrilled to learn three women had won .

"New York (CNN) -- Protests swelled in cities nationwide Friday as police forces struggled to either corral or remove demonstrators from downtown parks and plazas in the latest development of the monthlong Occupy Wall Street movement. Scores of protesters were arrested in Denver, Seattle, San Diego and New York, though reports of violence were rare. CNN iReporters sent in photos and video from ""occupy"" protests across several American cities. In San Diego, CNN affiliate KFMB broadcast images of police detaining demonstrators as they gathered amid tents and tarps strewn about a downtown plaza. Protesters appeared to refuse to leave the area, sitting in columns atop the plastic tarps and yelling ""stay down"" as police tried to remove them from the scene. At one point, police used pepper spray to break up the crowd. ""We understand people have a right to protest (but), somewhere along the line, people have a right to conduct business,"" San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne told CNN affiliate KGTV. Police eventually removed tents that had been set up by protestors and cleared the area by late afternoon. In Denver, authorities said 24 people were arrested as CNN affiliate KMGH broadcast aerial video of police detaining protesters in a downtown section of the city. Colorado State Police spokesman Mike Baker said the demonstrators could be identified as two distinct groups: The first was a part of what he described as the local ""Occupy"" group, which maintained close communication with law enforcement during the demonstration. The second, he said, was a more ""radical"" faction. ""These were the ones (police) came into trouble with today,"" Baker said. Most of those arrested in Denver were charged with unlawful conduct on state property, he said, while one other person was charged with simple assault. Another protester was arrested for impeding traffic. In Seattle, police in riot gear rounded up and arrested 41 demonstrators who gathered in a city park, said police spokeswoman Renee Witt. In New York , Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said law officers arrested 14 demonstrators after they sat in roadways to block traffic, overturned trash bins, knocked over a police scooter and hurled bottles. Wesleyan University student Ben Doernberg, who attended Friday's protest in Manhattan's financial district, shot video of at least one demonstrator being taken to the ground by police. The video captures a police officer pressing his night stick against the back of the protester's neck during the arrest. The man is seen face down on the pavement. He can be heard screaming after what Doernberg described as an earlier incident in which the man's leg was allegedly run over by a police motorcycle. ""I saw a number of other people being shoved or pushed with batons,"" Doernberg said. ""I saw another officer punching people."" New York police disputed the claim that the man had been run over by a police vehicle. Independent witnesses from the New York Daily News and The Associated Press saw the man intentionally place his legs under the scooter, Browne said in a statement. ""(The man) had repeatedly disregarded lawful orders to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk, and then feigned being run over before kicking over the police scooter. He was arrested for felony criminal mischief, obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest,"" the deputy police commissioner said. The demonstrations, meanwhile, seemed to pick up steam across the country by late Friday afternoon. CNN affiliate WDIV in Detroit showed aerial images of protesters rallying in city streets. An oversize sign fixed to the outside of a building read, ""Outsource to Detroit."" Hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons called the protests ""inspirational."" ""People want this country to be better,"" he told CNN. ""They want the money out of Washington."" He said he believes the U.S. government remains largely controlled by corporations. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also addressed the concerns again earlier Friday during his weekly radio show. He said Brookfield Office Properties -- the real estate firm that owns Zuccotti Park, considered a home base for Manhattan protesters -- made the decision not to try to clean up the park, as it had announced, after the company was ""inundated"" with threatening calls from elected city officials. The mayor said on New York's WOR Radio that he didn't know which officials allegedly made the threats, but the company decided to work out some form of a negotiated settlement in the coming days. Bloomberg added that while he lacked firsthand knowledge of the conversations, he was told the officials generally threatened to ""make life more difficult"" for the real estate company. Brookfield Properties issued a statement later Friday saying ""a number of local political leaders"" requested the cleaning of the park be deferred for ""a short period of time."" But the company declined to provide specifics on which city officials had made the calls or whether they were considered threatening. The clean-up cancellation, meanwhile, averted a broader showdown between authorities and demonstrators, who appeared heartened by news. ""We are winning and Wall Street is afraid,"" protester Kira Moyer-Sims said in a written statement distributed by the group. ""This movement is gaining momentum and is too big to fail."" Bloomberg's office also said the real estate firm withdrew its request for police assistance Friday. ""Our position has been consistent throughout: the city's role is to protect public health and safety, to enforce the law, and guarantee the rights of all New Yorkers,"" said Deputy Mayor Cas Holloway. City officials in New York had initially told the protesters, who have been mostly peaceful, that they would have to be ready to move out of the way of cleaners beginning at 7 a.m. But the demonstrators mopped, collected trash and scrubbed the pavement in the dead of the night as the Friday deadline neared. When the word of the postponed cleaning filtered through the more than 1,000 protesters who filled the park, they appeared jubilant. ""All day! All week! Occupy Wall Street,"" the group chanted, calling the development a victory of passive resistance. ""We're extremely excited. This is an example of what people power can do,"" said Tyler Combelic, a spokesman for the group. ""This is what democracy is all about in this country,"" Protesters descended on Zuccotti Park, near the New York Stock Exchange, on September 17 to protest the nation's ailing economy. A number of unions, including the United Auto Workers and the United Federation of Teachers, have since pledged to support the New York protest and similar demonstrations cropping up across the country. ""You want to clean up something? Clean up these crooks on Wall Street,"" shouted City Council member Charles Barron. Brooklyn Councilwoman Letitia James said the move to clean the park was a ""ruse"" to end the protest. But Bloomberg said Wednesday that the decision to clean the park was made after the owners voiced concerns about ""unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park."" ""The mayor is a strong believer in the First Amendment and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest,"" his office said in a written statement. But the situation in the park is ""not in the best interests of the protesters, residents or the city,"" it added. Share your photos, video from the protests, but stay safe . Local business owners and residents have continued to express concerns about sanitation and the group's affect on the local economy. The plan had been to clean the park in stages, with protesters being allowed to return to the park as areas were cleaned, but only if they obeyed the rules set forth by Brookfield Properties, the company said. Authorities had distributed a pamphlet at the park outlining the rules, which included a ban on camping or pitching tents; lying on the ground or on benches; placing tarps or sleeping bags on the ground; and storing personal property that interferes with park use. The protest campaign began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange.

"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Nearly two months ago, President Obama embarked on a two-day, two-city charm offensive in Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country and NATO military ally whose people give the United States abysmal approval ratings. President Obama listens at a town hall-style meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, in April. The American president toured a mosque, laid a wreath at the grave of the founder of the Turkish republic, and announced before the Turkish parliament that ""the United States is not and will never be at war with Islam."" Did Obama's new brand of diplomacy work? Could 48 hours of handshakes, speeches and smiles turn around Turkish public opinion? After all, in 2007, only 9 percent of Turks polled by the Pew Research Center held favorable views of America, the lowest level among 47 countries surveyed. If 24-year old Ece Basaran is any indicator, Obama succeeded beyond expectations. After attending a town hall-style meeting with the American president during his visit to Istanbul last April, Basaran and a group of her friends started up a Turkish-American friendship club at her university. ""I get positive feedback because everybody around me likes Obama,"" Basaran said, while taking a break from preparing for final exams at Istanbul's Bahcesehir University this week. Basaran said that as recently as last year, the United States was unpopular among fellow students and friends, but added that ""after Obama, it seems popular. At least the negative image began to fade away."" Officials and commentators in both Turkey and the United States are also calling Obama's first presidential visit to a Muslim country a positive step. ""At the moment, he's doing the right thing,"" said Suat Kiniklioglu, a member of the Turkish parliament. ""His first task was to remedy the situation of America wielding a big stick for the last eight years."" ""President Obama's visit and recent policy initiatives have managed to dispel some of the pervasive suspicion in U.S.-Turkish relations -- no small achievement,"" said Ian Lesser of the German Marshall Fund, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month. But, he added, ""much remains to be done."" There are strong indications that words alone will not be enough to transform years of deep suspicion many Turks feel towards the United States, particularly after the long, widely unpopular war in neighboring Iraq. According to a recent poll published by academics at Bahcesehir University, 43 percent of Turks said they would not like to live next door to American neighbors. In a phone interview this week, Osman Solmaz, another of the Turkish students chosen to attend the town hall meeting with Obama, said that in his hometown, the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir, ""the majority of the people have prejudice against the United States."" ""Nobody agrees with America's foreign policy,"" said Sertac Yakin, a university student from Ankara who also attended the Istanbul meeting in April. ""To change public opinion in Turkey is a long-term affair,"" argued Kemal Koprulu, the founder of Ari Movement, an Istanbul-based nongovernmental organization that focuses on promoting youth participation in civil society. ""There is no way that the election of a president and several nice statements from a State Department spokesman will change dramatically the public opinion in Turkey."" Koprulu argued that his organization has documented alarmingly high levels of anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism among young Turks. He pointed out that at a recent academic conference at one of Turkey's most progressive universities in Istanbul, he witnessed audience members give a five-minute standing ovation to a Turkish speaker who ""slammed America"" in front of a panel of visiting U.S. officials. The White House does appear to have made some progress in patching up damaged relations with the powerful Turkish military. Top Turkish army generals did not attend an important bilateral conference in the United States last year, following American criticism of Turkey's cross-border military offensive against Kurdish PKK rebels in Northern Iraq. This year, the Turkish military chief of staff was among the key speakers attending the conference. But Gen. Ilker Basbug reportedly told the audience of dignitaries in Washington this week that the ongoing presence of PKK rebels in Northern Iraq continues to have a negative impact on Turkish-U.S. relations. Many Turks say they are still waiting to see to whether the Obama White House's change in tone will translate to a change in the U.S. government's deeply unpopular foreign policy in the Middle East. They highlighted America's strong support for Israel over the Palestinians, and the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I believe [Obama] understands the importance of the Islamic world,"" said Abdurrahman Dilipak, a columnist at Vakit, Turkey's most conservative newspaper. ""We will monitor his stance. He makes promises yet we have to see how he will act. Muslims are still treated as terrorists when they arrive in the U.S."" That wait-and-see attitude was even reflected by Basaran, the enthusiastically pro-American student who helped found a Turkish-American friendship club at her university. ""Because Obama has the [Muslim] name Hussein, people really love it,"" Basaran said. ""I think he's the most favorite U.S. president among Muslim people. But we'll see."" Yesim Borg in Istanbul contributed to this report.","Poll says only 9 percent of Turks had positive view of U.S. in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- NBA players and owners did not reach a deal early Thursday on the bitter labor struggle that has postponed the basketball season, but the two sides agreed to meet again later in the day to continue with the negotiations. NBA commissioner David Stern had said that players had until 5 p.m. Wednesday to accept the terms of a labor offer that would give players between 49% and 51% of basketball revenues. If it didn't accept the deal, the NBA would offer another proposal that would offer players 47% of basketball revenues. Stern said he had frozen that deadline to allow negotiations to continue. ""Every day that we lose another game it causes both sides to recognize the damage,"" Stern told reporters. Both sides met for about 12 hours Wednesday and early Thursday morning. ""We spent a lot of time covering all of the issues that we still have remaining, but we can't say there was significant progress made today,"" Fisher said. The NBA season has been canceled through at least November 30, and the two sides are hoping they can reach a resolution before more games are called off. Stern has said the 2010-2011 season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players. The league lost as much as $300 million last season, according to Stern. One of the battles has focused on the owners' rejection of calls by the players' union for an average $7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal. The current average salary is about $5 million. Other big issues include a fight over a move by owners to gain the bigger share of revenues and whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap. The league's owners began a lockout of players in early July.","Both sides agree to meet Thursday .

"(CNN) -- The family behind a dramatic flight of a helium balloon that floated free appeared on a reality show that highlighted concerns about the children's safety. The Heene family appeared on two episodes of ABC's ""Wife Swap."" Richard and Mayumi Heene and their three sons were featured on the ABC show ""Wife Swap,"" in which the mothers of two often opposite families switch places for two weeks. Mayumi Heene traded places with Karen Martel, whose husband runs a child-proofing business intended to keep children safe, according to a recap posted on Reality TV Magazine. In listing information on the Heene family, ABC's ""Wife Swap"" Web site described them this way: ""When the Heene family aren't chasing storms, they devote their time to scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research-gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm."" The description of the episode from ABC that appears on the Web site said ""[Martel] is shocked as the Heene kids jump off banisters and run wild, and appalled by Richard's attitude to women."" ""Meanwhile at the Martels', Mayumi Heene sees safety gates everywhere and wonders how the family have fun. She asks the kids about their anxieties and confronts Jay about the climate of fear in his house."" The Heenes reportedly allowed their children to accompany them as they tracked Hurricane Gustav. A YouTube video of the family appearing on Denver, Colorado's KMGH local newscast features two of the Heene sons briefly discussing chasing the Hurricane. ""What my kids learn from these storms and what they walk away with is the fact that these storms can be very deadly,"" Richard Heene told the KMGH reporter. According to the newscast, the family track 30 to 40 weather activities a year. The family was invited back by ABC to appear on the 100th episode of ""Wife Swap,"" where Mayumi Heene switched places with Sheree Silver, a psychic. A Los Angeles Times story documented the show by saying ""The Heene family, with its three rowdy boys, is anchored by father Richard, whose anger arrives in sudden bolts between his fringe science projects."" ""The Silvers, who have two quirky, artistically inclined sons, revolve around the mother, Sheree, who is a psychic and who initially fails to impress Richard. 'Sheree's like a clogged drain, OK? Things aren't happening,' he barks. 'I'll bet you the heaviest thing she lifts is the fork to her mouth.' "" Mayumi Heene reportedly found it difficult on the show to adjust to Silver's household. ""It's their spouses who struggle most,"" the Los Angeles Times story said. ""Richard's wife, Mayumi, finding Sheree's 'househusband,' Sam Castiglia, to be 'a very feminine husband' and finds it tough to even tolerate the quirks of the Silver children, who are so unlike her own, seeming less like a parent than a conspirator against the alien family. So much for learning."" A balloon that was set adrift from the Heenes' Fort Collins, Colorado, home was empty when it landed, and authorities later found one of the Heene sons -- who initially had been thought to be in the balloon -- safe on the ground. Officials said he had been hiding in the attic of the family's garage. What appears to be the three Heene boys are featured in a YouTube rap music video that seems to spoof overprotective parents.","The Heene family of Fort Collins, Colorado, appeared on ""Wife Swap"" twice .

"(CNN) -- At least two bombs were dropped near the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan, resulting in an undetermined number of casualties, the spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Thursday. ""We are very concerned that these bombs were dropped in an area where there are thousands of refugees who have gathered after fleeing the violence in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""It is essential that both parties immediately take all steps to protect civilian lives."" In Washington, the office of the White House press secretary said in a statement that the United States ""strongly condemns the aerial bombardment by the Sudan Armed Forces of the town of Yida,"" where more than 20,000 refugees who have fled conflict in the Sudanese state of Southern Kordofan are living. The Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile State and Nuba Mountain regions straddle Sudan and South Sudan's geographical and political lines. Although these territories are geographically part of Sudan, its population has faced ""exclusion, marginalization and discriminatory practices that have resulted in their opposition to the Sudanese government,"" according to the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""This bombing of civilians and humanitarian workers is an outrageous act, and those responsible must be held accountable for their actions,"" the statement said. The attack follows other bombardments by the Sudan Armed Forces on November 8 near the border that increase the potential for confrontation between Sudan and South Sudan, it said. ""The United States demands the Government of Sudan halt aerial bombardments immediately,"" the statement said. ""We urge the Government of South Sudan to exercise restraint in responding to this provocation to prevent further escalation of hostilities."" It called for a resumption of negotiations by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North. President H.E. Saliva Kiir Mayardit has said he will not support armed opposition forces fighting against the government of Sudan, the South Sudan government website said. Kiir said Sudan was threatening the sovereignty of South Sudan ""through military invasion."" Liberation army members have clashed with the military of South Sudan, which separated from Sudan and became independent in July. Led by former officers of the southern army that fought neighboring Sudan in a 22-year civil war, the militias have taken up arms against their former comrades and become a challenge for the world's newest nation.","NEW: South Sudan president accuses Sudan of ""military invasion""

"(CNN) -- Third seed Roger Federer returned to winning ways after a 10-month title drought with a convincing straight sets victory over Japan's Kei Nishikori in the Swiss Indoors championship in Basel. Former world number one Federer delighted his home fans by powering to a 6-1 6-3 success, his fifth in the last six Basel events. The triumph also ended a relatively barren 2011 for Federer, whose only other ATP Tour title this season came in January's Qatar Open in Doha. Nishikori, who had stunned world number one Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, had no answer to 30-year-old Federer, who was reaching his first final since losing to Rafael Nadal in the French Open at Roland Garros in June. Federer, who was securing his 68th career title, told reporters: ""It's great to win at home once again. It was a perfect match for me and now I have big hopes for Paris and London this month."" Federer continued: ""I've known, ever since I hit with him as a teenager, that Kei could have a good future. He has had some injuries but he's playing well now. It was a good match and I'm very happy for the win."" Nishikori added: ""I tried to fight, but Roger would not let me into the match. I'm very glad to have played the final, it has always been one of my goals to play Roger.""

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Sectarian rioting broke out in eastern Belfast late Monday, with leaders from both Catholic and Protestant communities reporting attacks on homes overnight. Police reported Molotov cocktails were being thrown as a large crowd gathered on the streets that separate Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods in the area, a longstanding Northern Ireland flash point. Ambulance services reported two people injured early Tuesday, and reporters attempting to cover the disturbances were threatened. The Irish republican party Sinn Fein said up to 100 masked men raided Catholic-owned homes in the Short Strand neighborhood after allegations by unionist politicians that Protestant homes were attacked Sunday. Police had no information on any of Sunday's reported attacks. Sinn Fein blamed the attacks on Catholics on members of the Ulster Volunteer Force, a loyalist paramilitary group that officially disarmed in 2009. Police had no immediate comment on the assertion. After a long period of quiet in its ongoing ""Troubles"" between Catholics and Protestants, Northern Ireland has seen a resurgence of violence in recent months. Tensions also are typically elevated in early summer, when Protestant groups hold commemorative marches to celebrate the 17th-century victory of England's King William III over his Catholic predecessor, James II.","Molotov cocktails mark east Belfast clashes .

"University Park, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The Penn State football coach who alerted head coach Joe Paterno in 2002 that he'd seen a former defensive coordinator sexually assault a boy -- an allegation authorities didn't learn of until years later -- was placed Friday on indefinite leave, the school's interim president said. With that, Mike McQueary became the latest casualty in a scandal that began with last week's arrest of the man he allegedly witnessed commit the crime. The arrest set off a chain of events, including the ouster of the university's president and of longtime coach Paterno, a move that sparked on-campus riots after it was announced Wednesday. McQueary in recent months told a grand jury that, when he was a graduate assistant, he saw Jerry Sandusky, now 67, sexually assault a young boy at the campus' football complex. He said he reported the incident to Paterno, who alerted Athletic Director Timothy Curley, Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said earlier this week. Neither Paterno, 84, nor McQueary is criminally charged. Kelly has said that the alleged failure of Curley and Gary Schultz, the university's senior vice president for finance and business, to tell authorities about McQueary's abuse claim ""likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many, many years."" On Friday, acting President Rodney Erickson announced that he and newly named Athletic Director Mark Sherburne had decided to put McQueary on administrative leave. A day earlier, the school athletic department said McQueary would not coach in Saturday's game against Nebraska due to ""multiple threats"" against him. ""It became clear that Coach McQueary could not function in this role, under these circumstances,"" Erickson said of the decision. Sandusky, the football team's defensive coordinator between 1977 and 1999, was taken into custody Saturday for allegedly sexually assaulting children. Sandusky, who is free on $100,000 bail, disputes the 23-page grand jury summary of graphic testimony describing the alleged crimes between 1994 and 2009, his attorney, Joseph Amendola, has said. On Friday, the lawyer told CNN that a rock had been thrown through a window at Sandusky's home. The scandal has stirred an uproar and a flurry of action over how Penn State athletic and administrative officials handled the matter. Erickson said Friday that he'll appoint an ethics officer to report directly to him. He added that he wants to encourage openness and dialogue among the school's 96,000 students so that they do not hesitate to report such allegations. ""Never again should anyone at Penn State -- regardless of their position -- feel scared to do the right thing,"" he said. Earlier, he announced the creation of a committee to review sexual abuse allegations at the school -- an inquiry that its chairman, Kenneth Frazier, promised Friday would be ""rigorous, objective and impartial."" State Education Secretary Ronald Tomalis will serve as vice chairman, it was announced at a board meeting. Erickson's predecessor was Graham Spanier, who initially had voiced support for Curley and Schultz and later was removed from office by a unanimous vote of the board of trustees. A senior Navy official told CNN on Friday that, ""based on the events this week at Penn State, Navy officials are reviewing"" Spanier's membership on the board of advisers at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. The 18 members of the federal advisory committee are nominated to four-year terms. A recommendation to renominate Spanier had been in the works, but will likely be pulled back, the Navy official said. Meanwhile, students held a candlelight vigil Friday night on the University Park campus -- the same place where, two days earlier, others rioted after the university's trustees fired Paterno. The vigil is one of several efforts aimed at bringing attention to child sexual abuse. ""We are just as horrified, if not more, than a lot of people,"" said senior Kyle Harris, 21, a vigil organizer. ""We want to make an impact. We want to show these kids we care."" Friday's event, which began at 9:30 p.m., included comments from a sex abuse victim, musical performances and a moment of silence as the clock struck 10 p.m. at the campus' Old Main building. The Foundation to Abolish Child Abuse is planning its own vigil between 4 and 6 p.m. Saturday in support of victims/survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Warning signs of sexual abuse . Michael Gillum, the psychologist for the person referred to as ""Victim 1"" in the Pennsylvania grand jury report, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday night he was ""stunned"" that so many individuals, after witnessing or hearing allegations about Sandusky, did not come forward sooner. The report says that Gillum's patient was ""11 or 12 years old when he met Sandusky through The Second Mile Program in 2005 or 2006."" The Second Mile is a charity Sandusky founded to help troubled youths. The youth had been a houseguest at Sandusky's home in Centre County, Pennsylvania. ""During the course of the multi-year investigation, the grand jury heard evidence that Sandusky indecently fondled Victim 1 on a number of occasions, performed oral sex on Victim 1 on a number of occasions and had Victim 1 perform oral sex on him on at least one occasion,"" the report said. Gillum said that people should understand ""the powerful differential between the victim and the perpetrator,"" adding that ""the more status the perpetrator has ... the more difficult it is for the victim to come forward, and, in particular, expect to be believed."" Anxiety, depression and fear of being found out are common among sex abuse victims, especially when the cases go public, the psychologist said. ""Even though he's a hero (for speaking up), it's not necessarily something that everyone understands and appreciates,"" Gillum said. The victim's mother told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" earlier Friday that she first got an inkling that something had happened when her ""son started acting out"" -- behavior that school counselors had dismissed as a ""puberty thing."" Eventually, he told her he wanted to look up information on sexual ""weirdos."" She said she asked him why, and he told her he wanted to see if Sandusky was mentioned. ""I said, 'Well, why would you look him up?' And he said, 'I don't know, he's a weirdo.' And I preceded to ask him if there was something he needed to tell me, and at that point, he didn't indicate anything."" Read the grand jury presentment. Warning: graphic content (PDF) Years later, when they had a ""heart-to-heart"" conversation, the woman said her son said he ""didn't know what to do."" ""You just can't tell Jerry no,"" the boy said, according to the mother. The accusations may extend beyond Pennsylvania. Authorities in San Antonio, Texas, said they are investigating the possibility that Sandusky may have committed sex crimes in 1999 when Penn State played in the Alamo Bowl. ""Victim 4"" in the grand jury report was identified as a member of Sandusky's family party for the bowl game. Opinion: Ethical lesson of Penn State scandal . Sandusky is accused of sexual offenses, child endangerment and ""corruption of a minor"" involving eight boys, most or all of whom he met through The Second Mile, prosecutors said. His involvement with The Second Mile, the charity he founded, provided him with access to ""hundreds of boys, many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations,"" the grand jury said. The former coach is said to have engaged in fondling and oral and anal sex with boys over at least 15 years, the grand jury's summary of testimony says. Curley and Schultz are criminally charged for failing to report the alleged abuse. Instead of reporting the 2002 shower incident to authorities, Curley and Schultz banned Sandusky from having children from The Second Mile visit the football building, Kelly said. With a record of 8-1, Penn State is ranked atop the Big Ten and is ranked No. 12 in the country, potentially in position to play in a premier Bowl Championship Series contest. The team faces the 19th-ranked Cornhuskers in a game set to begin at noon Saturday at Beaver Stadium. Erickson said Friday that it would ""not be fair"" to cancel Saturday's game, given that ""our student-athletes weren't involved in this situation"" and thus don't deserve to be penalized. On Friday night, the school issued a statement urging attendees not only to wear blue to raise awareness of child abuse, but to donate to Prevent Child Abuse Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape. Erickson said Friday that extra security would be in place for the contest, which the school said would mean ""strict"" enforcement on policies regarding bags being taken into the stadium. ""I hope and I believe we will see the best of our students tomorrow,"" Erickson said. ""They understand that Penn State is really in the spotlight.""

"Honolulu, Hawaii (CNN) -- In her own right, Ann Dunham, the mother of U.S. President Barack Obama, lived an accomplished, international life that began in white-bread Kansas, weaved through Asia-light Hawaii and wound up in Indonesia. Now an exhibition celebrating her life in the world's most populous Muslim nation is opening in Hawaii featuring her personal art and artifact collection. Across the east-west palette, Dunham's family and friends paint her as an ardent anthropologist, early maven of microfinance and a cultured, curious explorer. Her daughter, Maya Soetoro-Ng, proudly wrote of her mother's anthropological work in Surviving Against the Odds: Village Industry in Indonesia, a book based on Dunham's original dissertation from the early 1990s. ""She had so much respect for the communities where she conducted her research. Always logical and rigorous, our mother's scholarship was made truly meaningful by the fact that she loved the people she wrote about and hoped others would hear their song."" Alice Dewey was one of Dunham's first mentors to help compose that tune. Now Professor Emeritus at the University of Hawaii Manoa, she served as Dunham's anthropology adviser in the 1970s. She remembers their connection as an instant match. ""I want her!"" recalls Dewey after seeing Dunham's resume on her work in Indonesia. As it turned out, the pair shared a distinct passion for local Indonesian markets and wares on the central island of Java. As a student herself, Dewey had studied local Javanese markets in the 1950s. Dunham would later extend those studies from the markets to the makers of woven bamboo baskets, tie-dyed batiks and open-fired iron blades. In a testament to her topical thirst, Dunham pitched Dewey a very broad research plan. ""When she submitted her research proposal to me she wanted to focus on not just one -- but five -- areas of Indonesian trade: batik, bamboo, ceramics, shadow puppetry and blacksmithing."" Dewey forced her to choose one. Dunham settled on blacksmithing, the craft of firing and bending hot iron into such things as knives and cooking utensils. ""But she got us back with a 1,000-page dissertation. The norm was about 300 to 500."" Bron Solyom describes her friendship with Dunham as a bond forged through blacksmithing. Now curator of special collections at the University of Hawaii Library, she and Dunham met as fellow graduate student in the 1970s. ""We had this common, strong interest. Ann saw blacksmithing from an economic aspect -- in how people made a non-agrarian living. And she built up this body of knowledge that was really remarkable."" And Dunham's desire to learn seemed to be unflappable -- even in the face of danger. Solyom recounted the story of when the two were working in Bali in the early 1990s. After checking in to one hotel, Dunham ""was gone for ages"" while Solyom waited in the lobby. When Dunham finally emerged she apologized saying she had had to evict a green -- and likely poisonous -- snake from her room. But before she did that, she had done a photo shoot as the serpent swayed to itself in the mirror. ""She was just calm about things -- and forever curious,"" remembered Solyom. That insatiable curiosity also led to copious note-taking -- some of which is just being found. Dewey recently opened up an old trunk in her home and saw the name ""Dunham"" written inside. Daunted at the thought of poring over more work from her former student, she says she quickly shut the lid and has not opened it since. According to her daughter, most of Dunham's notes and other personal effects -- those known and those rediscovered -- will find a final home in the archives of the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. by next year. Besides the obvious field notes Dunham left behind, Soetoro-Ng adds that something more intangible is something she thinks of often. ""I do think about her delight. In one photo, her eyes are shut and she's just really letting go with some of her staff and colleagues. That was overlooked at times and in the years since she passed away I've been burdened with the sadness of missing her -- and she died so young. And even though she didn't succeed in marriage and longevity there are many ways her life is a model of success that we can aspire to."" In 1995, just before her 53rd birthday, Ann Dunham died after a short battle with ovarian cancer. In traditional Hawaiian fashion, her ashes were scattered into the waters of the islands. A pre-presidential Obama and his sister Maya Soetoro-Ng performed the honors. Dewey says Dunham's life poetically concluded the way she lived it ""traveling forever around the world,"" a fitting final journey for an explorer who lived between the east and west for much of her life. Through Her Eyes: S. Ann Dunham's Fieldwork in Indonesia runs through January 8, 2012 at the East-West Center Gallery, University of Hawaii Manoa. It includes photographs taken during Ann Dunham's years of field research in Indonesia as well as personal artifacts which include examples of metal smithing, jewelry and basketry made in the villages of Indonesia. Dunham's personal art and artifact collection has been augmented by recent purchases to give wider context to her work in Indonesia.","Dunham's family and friends paint her as ardent anthropologist and explorer .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York medical examiner's office said Saturday that a body discovered this week along a remote stretch of Long Island beach was that of Shannan Gilbert, the missing New Jersey woman whose disappearance led investigators to 10 sets of human remains and the hunt for a possible serial killer. Gilbert, 24, vanished in May 2010 after visiting a client. The Jersey City resident, police said, had advertised for prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist. Her body was uncovered Tuesday in the wooded marshes of Suffolk County's Oak Beach. The cause of her death has not yet been determined, police said in a statement. ""Our condolences to the Gilbert family and her friends,"" said Police Commissioner Richard Dormer. ""We hope this brings them closure and peace."" Investigators cut through a fresh thicket of brush and bramble along Long Island's southern shoreline earlier this week, expanding their investigation across a recently drained swampland on the barrier island before uncovering Gilbert's remains. They were found at 9:14 a.m. Tuesday by police divers and detectives riding atop amphibious vehicles, roughly a quarter-mile from where her purse was found a week before. The purse was discovered near a cell phone, shoes and a pair of jeans, according to investigators. After Gilbert vanished last year, the hunt for her led police seven months later to four bodies stuffed in bushes along a quarter-mile stretch of Ocean Parkway in Oak Beach. All four were later identified as women and, like Gilbert, had advertised for prostitution services online. The bodies were found in various stages of decomposition. Additional remains were later uncovered in neighboring Gilgo Beach and in Nassau County, about 40 miles east of New York City. Unlike other victims found scattered across the two counties, Gilbert is not thought to have been murdered by the suspected serial killer, police have said. But on Thursday, top law enforcement officials publicly sparred over competing theories in the case. Dormer has said a single person is likely responsible for the alleged murders. ""The theory is now that we're dealing with one serial killer,"" he told reporters in November, reiterating his position during a county legislative hearing on Thursday. Moments later during the same hearing, Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota took the stand and rejected Dormer's statement. ""I very very much disagree with that theory,"" said Spota. ""I don't know of anybody who, in the police department, who is actively conducting the investigation who shares that theory. ""Quite frankly, I don't know why there was a unilateral change in theories."" In May, Spota told reporters that a collection of human remains were not believed to be connected to the first four victims. Dormer, who initially told reporters the bodies could be the work of a killer or multiple killers, later pointed to a similar dumping ground as one common aspect of the investigation that could support the notion of a single killer. Authorities have sifted through more than 1,000 tips related to the case. But it's unclear whether that has shed any light on an investigation that continues to garner national attention. In June, police upped the ante in their search for a culprit. The reward for information leading to an arrest -- once topping out at $5,000 -- was raised five-fold, making it the largest offered in Suffolk County history in an apparent bid to fill out a case that some fear has gone cold.","Authorities confirm that a body discovered this week was that of Shannan Gilbert .

"(CNN) -- Singer Andy Williams has bladder cancer, is undergoing treatment and plans to return to performing in 2012, he said. ""You may have read or heard that I have bladder cancer. It's true and I'm currently undergoing treatment to deal with it,"" Williams said in a statement. The singer also told fans at a concert in Branson, Missouri, Saturday night that he has cancer, a reporter who attended the concert told CNN on Sunday. ""But that is no longer a death sentence. People with cancer are getting through this thing,"" Williams said, according to Tyler Francke with the Branson Tri-Lakes News. ""They're kicking it, and they're winning more and more every year. And I'm going to be one of them,"" Francke quoted the singer as saying. Williams, 83, shared the news during his Christmas Show at the Moon River Theater, which he founded in 1992, according to the theater's website. ""Moon River"" was one of Williams' most popular songs. The description of Williams' Christmas Show on his website lists several guest stars, and notes that ""due to health reasons, Andy may not make a live appearance in his Christmas Show."" In his statement, the singer said he plans to return to performing in 2012. Attempts by CNN to contact the Moon River Theater for comment were not immediately successful. Williams began his singing career as a child in a quartet with his three older brothers. He later got a regular gig on Steve Allen's ""Tonight"" show and then his own variety program, ""The Andy Williams Show,"" in the 1960s. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","NEW: Williams says he is undergoing treatment for bladder cancer .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Whether you're a fan of any sport, or even just a keen music follower -- you've probably visited a major stadium. The ugliest stadiums in the world? Have a look at our list and tell us what you think of the choices. Like all buildings with any form of public use, stadiums tend attract more than their fair share of criticism. It's hard to visit a massive venue that has possibly seen millions of dollars of taxpayer money poured into it, without forming an opinion. While usability, safety, comfort for players and fans, and the ability to generate a steady income are probably the most important factors for modern-day stadiums, there is one other aspect that is sometimes forgotten: how they look. We have scanned the world for some of the ugliest stadiums in the world, and we've drawn up a first XI of the less attractive venues. The stadiums come from all corners of the globe and have been built under all types of budgets. Some of these structures may have been referred to by others as ""ugly"", they may be facing the threat of being torn down, or we may have just decided that they aren't so easy on the eye.  See a photo gallery of ugliest stadiums in the world Â» . Some examples that made it into the list include the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which was built in 1987 and lays claim to having the biggest stadium roof in the world. But sadly does not boast the most attractive structure. The choice of Wembley Stadium in London, England, may be a controversial one, however, it was named in a list of Britain's ugliest buildings by Britain's The Times newspaper as ""a bloated middle-aged office block with a pitch attached.""

"Sirte, Libya (CNN) -- On the outskirts of Sirte, a mansion with a columned facade lies in ruins, though its opulence is still evident under shattered glass and chunks of concrete. This was Moammar Gadhafi's home in the city of his birth. The house had its own salon with barber chairs and massage tables. Ornate four-poster beds furnished the bedrooms and there were lavish decorations all around. In the basement is a large conference room. Is this where Gadhafi planned his last stand or arranged for his escape? The deposed leader has not been seen in public for months. His whereabouts are unknown but some believe he may still be hiding in Sirte. People wandering through the house are stunned. They thought Gadhafi lived in a tent. Most residents have abandoned Sirte after a month of fierce battles. Revolutionary forces have fought Gadhafi loyalists street by street, cornering the last vestiges of the old regime to one district. With their backs to the Mediterranean, the loyalists used machine gun nests and snipers atop buildings to fight back Friday. The sound of rockets and artillery pierced the air; smoke billowed over the skyline. Time and time again, the revolutionaries have come to the brink of victory. But they have not been able to claim it yet. Until they do, the National Transitional Council will not declare liberation in Libya. Taking control of Gadhafi's hometown is key to moving forward in building a new nation. Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF or in English, Doctors Without Borders) said some of Sirte's residents remain trapped in the fighting. The medical charity said it has been able to work at the Ibn Sina hospital. from where the International Committee of the Red Cross is evacuating patients to Tripoli. The 50 remaining patients are mostly people who have suffered violent trauma, severe burns and fractures, according to MSF. Almost all patients need daily dressing and immediate medical care. There are also some pregnant women in the hospital. There is no water supply in the hospital and one of four operating theaters has been shelled, MSF said. The medical staff has been working around the clock and are showing signs of exhaustion and post-traumatic stress disorder. Outside, a rag-tag army marches into battle again, many of the men strangely nonchalant as they stroll to the fight. Friday, the transitional council fighters were forced to retreat. They will regroup and push again, hoping for a highly anticipated victory. CNN's Dan Rivers and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Moammar Gadhafi's house had ornate furnishings and a salon with barber chairs .

"(CNN) -- This story is about how to know when to give up on a man, and when to stick with him. It's about Chris Johnson. I didn't know who Johnson was before this NFL season began. I haven't closely followed football since Joe Namath led my home team, the New York Jets, to victory in Super Bowl III, 42 Super Bowls ago. Now that I've been sucked into a fantasy football league by my extended family, I know Chris Johnson. He was a top draft choice for my team. The computer picked him. In fact, all ESPN fantasy football leagues chose Chris Johnson in their drafts this year. That's how good he was. He didn't even show up for the pre-season until his team, the Tennessee Titans, agreed to sign a contract worth more than $50 million. Johnson was a fantasy football owner's fantasy man. The hero falls down a hole . Week 1: Johnson's first game of the year is a bust -- 24 yards on nine carries. My son, who's in elementary school, is an unusually good strategic thinker for his age. ""Let's trade him,"" he says. ""We can't trade Chris Johnson,"" I tell him. I want to teach my son the value of patience. You don't give up on a human being after one bad performance. A friend who follows the NFL reinforces the patience theme. ""You can't trade Johnson,"" he says. ""He's explosive. He was off his stride the first game because he missed the pre-season holding out for that big contract."" Week 2: Another bomb. Fifty-three yards on 24 carries. I know this about football. It takes 10 yards to get a first down. Johnson is averaging less than three yards a carry. Could it be -- I'd need to punt Johnson? More pleas from my son to trade. I can see the writing on the wall: One bad week as a father -- ""Mom, trade Dad."" Week 3: Johnson's worst game yet. I start reading the fantasy football sports columnists. These are real sports columnists who write about fantasy teams comprised of real players arranged in fantasy lineups chosen by real people. Some are losing faith in Johnson, but hope still prevails. ""Wait and see"" is their collective advice. Week 4: Finally, a 100-yard game. Not a blockbuster. But a glimmer of hope. Week 5: The glimmer disappears. I come across an ESPN.com photo showing Johnson's offensive line wasn't creating big holes for him. At the same time, there are less-obvious holes Johnson isn't seeing -- champions have to create their own opportunities. My son's voice -- ""Trade him, dad, trade him!"" -- rings in my ears. The hero, hopeless . I come across a Sports Illustrated cover story from last year with Johnson's photo: ""Crash course: Hard hits and short careers,"" in which SI's Tim Layden writes that, at 24, Johnson is at the height of his powers. ""Johnson rushes with a palpable urgency befitting a man who runs a 4.24 in the 40, a speed all but unheard of in a running back. And he's urgent away from the field as well. Despite having three years remaining on the rookie contract he signed out of East Carolina in July 2008, he had his deal restructured just before the start of training camp, reportedly quadrupling in his salary for 2010. Because Johnson knows he is also this: endangered."" Endangered? My first draft pick -- endangered. Why? Why, according to the NFL Players Association, is the average running back's career 2.6 years? ""We get hit on every play,"" then-Redskins' running back Larry Johnson tells SI. ""On every one of those hits, we're the hittee, not the hitter. We run the ball, guys are taking shots at our legs, our hips. Then when we're not running the ball, we're pass-blocking, which means some strong safety or outside linebacker is getting a 30 yard run at us while we're stationary."" Week 6: Johnson's team, the Tennessee Titans, had a bye. A week off. We hoped a week of rest and reflection would be enough for Johnson to explode when he returned. By this point, my son knows not to ask about trading: He knows no team owners in our league would take Johnson. Week 7: Johnson's worst game yet. Ten carries. Eighteen yards. I'm thinking the Titans should draft me. Weeks 8 and 9: Well, the rhythm of this tale doesn't change. What now? So, here we are on the eve of week 10. Some of the real/fantasy sports writers are so fed up with Johnson, they're saying it's time to just drop him. Nothing in return. Just let the $50 million fantasy man go. But you know what? Now is the time I want to keep Johnson more than ever. I can't help rooting for an underdog. I know that every champion has been an underdog at least once. Forget the conventional wisdom of sports writers. I'm reaching out to the Association for Applied Sports Psychology. Head games . Glenn Pfenninger, head of the Ignite Performance Group in Dallas, Texas, says he and I have a lot in common. He's a fantasy football guy, too. We both own Chris Johnson. I'm doing a real interview and my expert is stuck in the fantasy world. I transition him back softly. ""What would you do to help Chris Johnson if you could?"" ""Have Johnson put together a highlight reel and watch some of his greater plays,"" he says. ""See that he can be explosive. Mentally envision doing that on a more consistent basis. That's good for him whether he's lacking in confidence right now or not."" Have him and his offensive line spend more time together. Watch tapes together. Get to know each other better. Are you listening, Titans? Please, get the word to Johnson and the offensive line. Another call: It's Eddie O'Connor, clinical sports psychologist. He describes himself as an NFL addict. He consults with athletes, coaches and parents at all levels of play. ""When I see performance slump,"" O'Connor says, ""it's almost always related to a lack of focus."" Maybe, now that Johnson has a great contract, he's not as motivated. Perhaps he's ""stuck on his bad performance, so his focus is on not making mistakes. ""When you focus on what you don't want to do, you're not thinking about what you do want to do. The time it takes to translate 'don't' into 'do' is too long for performance in sport."" So how can we help our fantasy man? Start with what's worked in the past and get in the moment. ""If you're not completely in the moment,"" O'Connor warns, ""if you're thinking about the past or the future, you're missing details. You're not interacting with what's right in front of you. You're trapped in the past or future."" And if you miss details, your performance in any area of life will suffer. I'm so in the moment, I don't even realize this piece is twice as long as it's supposed to be. OK. Three times. More head games . Carol Dweck, a psychology professor at Stanford University, has documented the kind of praise that helps children (and adults) succeed, and the kind that hurts. ""You need to praise the process, strategies, persistence, taking on of challenges. That's what builds resilience,"" Dweck says. ""When you tell kids they're brilliant, they become afraid of making a mistake -- afraid you'll rescind your gifted label. ""When they have a setback or difficulty they have trouble figuring out what to do next. They think 'Gee, I guess I'm not so great. What do I do now?' "" A $50 million contract can put someone into a ""fixed mindset."" It's an idea, she says, like ""'Some people have it. Some don't. I have it.'"" ""The problem with this mindset,"" she says, ""is that you have to prove that you have it all the time. ""Every play becomes a referendum on whether you have it or not. "" The alternative, Dweck says, is a ""growth mindset,"" an idea that "" 'I'm this person who works hard, who learns constantly.' Then when you have a few bad games you say, 'Hey, what am I doing wrong?' "" and try to correct it. That growth mindset is what's needed to get our Chris Johnson back on track. So here we are, loaded with insight, rooting for a comeback, cheering for the underdog. I still believe Chris Johnson will be a hero on my fantasy team and on his real team. Before I finish writing, I get an e-mail from another psychologist, Robert Simmermon in Atlanta. I'd asked him how a standout can come back from a deep, deep slump. ""In the hero's journey,"" he writes, ""the hero who was on top, the greatest, in the journey home, falls into a deep hole. All is lost and all but a few of the most loyal remain hopeful. One by one, the loyal give up hope. It is the darkest hour. Then, there is a rumbling. It is slight, then more potent until; THE GIANT PHOENIX IS THRUST OUT OF THE HOLE. THE HERO ON THE BACK OF THIS MAGNIFICENT BIRD IS ALIVE AND WELL. HE IS READY TO CONTINUE AND FINISH HIS QUEST."" That's where fantasy meets reality. Hopefully this Sunday.

"(CNN) -- All the world's a stage for Kim Kardashian, and we are merely players. Kim is everywhere.Â  She's on the cover of six magazines and counting: People, US, In Touch, OK, Star and OK! Her wedding/divorce/possible reconciliation has dominated the cybersphere and Hollywood news shows: ""Access Hollywood,"" ""Inside Edition,"" E!, TMZ. This is bigger than the Super Bowl and Christmas rolled into one. Kim should not just have her own TV shows, she should have her own network: KTV, all Kim, all the time. And even though the news du jour focuses on her marriage ending, which by the very nature of a marriage means two people are involved, the media barely mention her soon-to-be ex-husband. He's just a prop.Â  He's akin to ""The Brady Bunch's"" Greg Brady when Greg was cast as ""Johnny Bravo"" simply because the ornate jacket fit. I'll be honest, I've been caught up a bit in the Kim marriage/divorce craze myself. I've read more than my share of articles on the most documented 72-day marriage in the history of the Western world. I have to thank Kim Kardashian and that guy she married for giving us a brief respite from the drumbeat of the often depressing, bile-inducing news. On some level, I truly wish that Kim Kardashian's exploits could be our own only concerns.Â  Wouldn't it be great if the universe consisted solely of keeping up with Kim, her sisters, mother and her stepfather, Bruce Jenner, who won an Olympic gold medal for the decathlon and who should also receive a medal for plastic surgery -- his face is as smooth and wrinkle-free as a honeydew melon. We wouldn't have to worry about the challenges of the U.S. economy, Greece teetering on the verge of default (and potentially dragging down the eurozone) or Syrian President Assad's troops killing unarmed protesters. Instead, we'd worry:Â  Does Kim have to give the wedding gifts back?Â  Will she start dating right away -- especially since the NBA lockout offers her more options? Will her divorce hearings be on cable or pay-per-view? My fear is that Kim truly is our world. Kim, Justin and Lindsey have become the trinity worshipped at the expense of following domestic and world events. I know many people might ask: ""Why should I care about issues beyond those featured on E!'s 'Chelsea Lately' or TMZ?Â  Does it really impact me?Â  Can I actually change things?"" I don't want to repeat clichÃ©s like ""One person can make a difference."" But common sense tells me that if we don't understand the issues facing our nation, how can we have an opinion on them?Â  And in turn, how can we then intelligently criticize or support decisions our government is making, from taxes to foreign policy? Leadership from ""We, the People"" might be the only way to push our dysfunctional Congress to actually do something that helps the middle class and our economy. Just last week, Congress showed us what happens when we leave members to their own devices. Instead of considering a jobs bill or anything else to spur our economy, the House voted to reaffirm ""In God We Trust"" as the official motto of the United States. That should truly help the almost 14 million Americans of out of work. I propose that Rep. J. Randy Forbes, who came up with the idea for this, be required to reimburse taxpayers for any money wasted on this. Regardless if you agree or not with tea partiers' stand on political issues, they clearly have impacted U.S. policy. The Tea Party was started by a small group of dedicated, passionate people and it has grown in a few short years to a powerful force. And while it's too soon to tell, the ""Occupy"" movement might also influence policy, or at least bring some issues to light. Thomas Jefferson's words on the benefits of an informed electorate are still true: ""Whenever the people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government; that whenever things get so far wrong as to attract their notice, they may be relied on to set them right."" I'm not saying we shouldn't keep up with the Kardashians, but let's also keep up with the issues facing our nation.

"(CNN) -- Flooding caused by monsoon rains and swollen rivers has ravaged Thailand, affecting more than 9.5 million people nationwide. More than 380 people have died, and the overall damage is an estimated $6 billion dollars, the Thai Finance Ministry says. It is the worst flooding to hit the country in half a century, according to the Thai government. As the murky waters rise, so do health concerns. Charities working in the country predict water- and insect-borne illnesses like dengue fever and malaria will spike in the coming weeks. Relief organizations are on the ground providing shelter, supplies and medical aid to flood victims, and there are ways you can help. World Vision is passing out emergency relief kits and hygiene supplies to people living in highly affected areas. Mosquito nets are being distributed to help minimize the spread of insect-borne diseases as the waters crest. The orgnization is constructing safe places for children to play away from dangerous floodwater. At these ""Child-Friendly Spaces,"" kids can also participate in activities to help them cope with the trauma of this experience. Visit World Vision's website to make a donation to the organization's Disaster Response Fund. ShelterBox Response Teams have distributed 250 tents, 1000 mosquito nets and numerous water purifiers to flood victims in Ayutthaya and Lopburi. ShelterBox also delivered several ""Classrooms in a Box"" to damaged schools, and teams are working with the Thai army to build an evacuation shelter site. ""The army expects the site to be in use for around two months, so it is essential that it is well set up with secure, weather-proof shelter and good water, sanitation and hygiene facilities,"" says ShelterBox member Stephen Crabtree.

Volunteers and staff with the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies are working to distribute aid to communities cut off by the floods for over a week. The Thai Red Cross, an IFRC member, has helped victims in 36 provinces since the flooding began in June. It says it has given out more than 175,000 aid kits and 2 million bottles of water. Go online to donate to IFRC's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund. Catholic Relief Services and its partners have provided thousands of flood victims with weeks' worth of food aid, emergency medicine, and personal hygiene kits in some of the hardest hit areas around Bangkok. ""As we traveled, the water levels gradually rose to the point where shops were flooded -- some still open for business in knee-high water,"" said CRS response team member Ross Tomlinson. ""As night fell, we saw more and more people living in temporary shelters surrounded by their household goods."" As the water subsides, CRS says it will continue to help families rebuild and reestablish their businesses. Vist the CRS website to donate online or call 1-800-736-3467 from the United States to donate by phone. Smiles on Wings has launched a flood relief mission to help victims in Thailand.

"(CNN) -- Muslims in Switzerland are responding with shock and outrage after a pig carcass and severed swine heads were discovered buried at the site of a proposed mosque. Police in the town of Grenchen uncovered the pigs Friday after they received an anonymous message claiming that someone had buried the body parts and spilled 120 liters of blood from the animals in an effort to desecrate the ground to halt the construction of the mosque. Pork and pork byproducts are haram, or forbidden, in Islam. The unsigned flier, written in German, says ""This operation was done (conducted) to protest against the growing expansion of Islam in Switzerland,"" and says that a similar desecration in Spain earlier halted another mosque construction project. Thomas Suber, chief of the Solothurn Canton police, told CNN by phone that there were no suspects currently, but that a full investigation is under way. ""We can't say yet it is a hate crime in those words, but it could have been done to stop the mosque,"" said Suber. Suber said that whoever is responsible may be brought up on environmental pollution charges. The police chief says that veterinary health officials have been called in to find if pig's blood has in fact been spilled, and that charges may be filed over illegal dumping of animal parts in addition to other potential criminal charges. But for Muslims in Switzerland, it's just the latest sign that they are being victimized by some in the far right. Abdel Azziz Qaasim Illi, spokesman for Switzerland's Central Islamic Council said the deed ""crossed a line"" that had already been pushed against Muslims since a popular referendum in 2009 banned the construction of new minarets. ""Since the ban on minarets there's been an increase in Islamophobia and Islamophobic events, so it was not really surprising"" said Illi. ""But it is an escalation in Switzerland because this is a peaceful country where Christians and Muslims have all been living together... and we are a bit afraid this may increase."" There are an estimated 500,000 Muslims in Switzerland, out of a population of more than 7 million says Illi, who admitted that the population is rising but that most Swiss Muslims were immigrants from Albania and elsewhere in the Balkans, where there is a tradition of moderate Islam. The property had been purchased by the local Muslim community several years ago from a Swiss far right political activist. The man claimed that he had not been informed that it would be used for a mosque and had fought the sale in court, before ultimately losing his civil case recently allowing construction to go forward. ""We can just wait for the next rain or snowfall to cleanse the ground, so we do not fear from this side anything,"" said Illi. ""But on the other hand it's an emotional thing, it means that there are actually people in this society who deny the right of Muslims when it comes to a mosque in Switzerland and this is something that hurts us.""","Police in the town of Grenchen uncovered the pigs Friday .

"(The Frisky) -- We love men. In fact, we adore them. We like their bodies, their brains, and their strange way of doing things. So it's always a tricky tightrope when you're dealing with a guy to know when to be there for him -- and when to cut and run. Since we're here to help the ladies, we've created a handy guide that will help you know when your man is just being a dude -- or if you've got a dud on your hands who needs to be dumped. The Frisky: 7 chubby celebrity men who slimmed down . 1. ""I don't feel like having sex."" Sure, every man has an off day. But you know what? Most guys want to have sex all the time. And if you're not getting it on, on a regular basis, especially because your guy is claiming that he's just ""not feeling it,"" you can bet that your problems are going to turn out to be bigger than a case of the sex blues. In this particular situation, you may want to get to the root of the problem before this supposed dry spell kills your love, too. The Frisky: 30 things every woman should quit doing by 30 . 2. ""I can't stop crying."" Sure, sure, the new man is a metrosexual who is really in touch with his inner-self, does yoga, and gets waxed more than you do. But there's a limit to how much a woman can tolerate seemingly unmanly behaviors. Crying because there was a death in the family? Feel free. Prone to weeping at romantic comedies? Not so much. If your man can't control his emotions, and you find yourself feeling like you're the one wearing the pants in the relationship, you should ask yourself if that's what you want -- a guy who'll cry over spilt milk. The Frisky: Boys are taking over pageant contests . 3. ""I'm thinking about quitting my job."" There are two ways this one can go. He's dissatisfied with his current work situation, he wants to try something else, and this statement is a prelude to telling you all about his big plans for his next career move. That's fine. On the other hand, if you're living together, and one day he declares he's going to give two-weeks notice today, and so far as you can tell he doesn't have any idea what he'll be doing after that, or how he'll be paying for his part of your shared bills, this isn't someone who has a work issue. This is someone who has an I-want-my-mommy-to-take-care-of-me issue. 4. ""I need to tell you something."" This one never, ever ends well. If he has to prepare you for what he's going to say next, you best brace yourself for what's coming because it isn't going to be anything good. The Frisky: 12 celebs who denied getting breast implants . 5. ""I think we need to take a break."" Hey, guess what? This isn't school, and there will be no recess. Relationships are not like a Lego set: created to be dismantled and put back together again. ""Breaks"" are what guys who are too weak, scared, or lame suggest because they're too much of a you-know-what to go ahead and break up with you. Make it easy for this guy. Give him a break from the relationship. A permanent one. The Frisky: Facebook's new function? Divorce! 6. ""My last girlfriend was crazy."" True, your ex probably said the same thing to his new girlfriend, but you might want to keep an eye on the man whose history includes a long string of relationships with women who are totally temperamental, out of their gourds, or recently released from the state mental hospital. Guys who go out with lunatics think the crazy chick is the issue, but all too frequently he's the one with the problems. Whether he craves drama, mistakes insanity for passion, or prefers to hook up with ladies who can never truly be intimate, you're better off letting him move on to the next one -- the next crazy one, that is.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- The trial of two men accused of killing white supremacist leader Eugene Terreblanche is expected to start in the South African town of Ventersdorp on Monday. Terreblanche, the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, or AWB), was killed in April following an apparent dispute over wages with workers on his farm. Police have charged Chris Mahlangu, 29, and a 16-year-old in the death. The trial was initially scheduled for December but was postponed several times as lawyers for the defendants changed. Terreblanche, 69, was bludgeoned with clubs and stabbed with a machete during the attack at his farm near Ventersdorp in South Africa's North West province, police said. The AWB is best known for trying to block South Africa's effort to end apartheid. The group used terrorist tactics in a bid to stall the country's first all-race vote in 1994, killing more than 20 people in a wave of bombings on the eve of the elections. Terreblanche was convicted of a 1996 attempted murder of a black man who worked as a security guard on his farm. He served about two-thirds of a five-year sentence.","White supremacist Eugene Terreblanche was bludgeoned and stabbed at his farm .

"Detroit (CNN) -- Thanksgiving Day 2008 shows where Detroit has been. The Detroit Lions have played at home every Thanksgiving since 1934. It is the city's greatest football tradition. Yet instead of a source of great pride, the game had become an embarrassment, as well as representative of everything going horribly wrong in Detroit. The auto industry melted down with alarming and unprecedented speed. The City of Detroit was rife with political scandal that eventually put Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and several other prominent public officials behind bars. All this turmoil came while the Lions were poised to be the only team in NFL history to go 0-16. The sentiment? The Lions were viewed as incredible losers in the NFL landscape, so we must be incredible losers, too. However, the fans maintained their love for the team in spite of their obvious difficulties. The Tennessee Titans ended up thrashing the Lions, 47-10. Tennessee's defensive coordinator that day was Jim Schwartz. Less than two months later, he was the Lions' head coach. ""I don't remember much about the game other than we had our concerns about winning it, but I do recall the drive into the city."" Schwartz said. ""You could just see and feel what was happening at the time. It was eye-opening."" That was in stark contrast to what is happening in Detroit three years later. In 2011, the Lions are 4-0 for the first time since 1980. Their matchup Monday night against Chicago at Ford Field is perhaps the most anticipated football game the Lions have played since they advanced to the NFC championship game in 1991. Meanwhile on the mound in Detroit, the Tigers are also showing amazing promise. In a thrilling game, the Tigers beat the New York Yankees 3-2 on Thursday to advance to the American League Championship Series. The Tigers did capture the AL pennant in 2006 -- eliminating the Yankees -- but had been a high-payroll, low-achieving club since until this summer, when they ran away with the AL Central title. The pressure to deliver the division title this season was so intense that on the night the Tigers clinched, tears welled in manager Jim Leyland's eyes as he was interviewed by Fox Sports Detroit team broadcaster Mario Impemba. ""At times like this, sports teams can lift the spirits of their fans,"" Leyland said, his voice cracking. ""I hope we uplifted their spirits, because they deserved it."" At this moment in Detroit, it seems like both teams, the Lions and Tigers, are lifting each other's as well as this city's spirits. ""We're all allies,"" Leyland said. ""We're pulling for one and another. Good atmosphere for the city. Makes people forget about their troubles with good times with sports."" The success of the Lions and Tigers has hardly made the city's problems go away.The 2010 census numbers revealed that Detroit's population dropped to 713,777. Detroit had once been the nation's fourth largest city, with more than 1.8 million people. Michigan was the only state in the nation to have a net loss in population since the 2000 census. There are entire blocks of Detroit that are nothing but vacant houses. Violence is also a major issue. In one 24-hour period on an August weekend, 16 people were shot and seven killed. Yet there are some signs of hope in the economy. The auto industry seems to be doing better. Ford Motor Co. stock is up nearly 11 times its value at the depths of the meltdown, while General Motors is trading publicly again and reporting profits. Chrysler is reportedly turning a profit, too, and is still reaping the benefits from its Super Bowl commercial featuring Detroit's own Eminem. The ad references ""hard work, conviction and a know-how that runs generations deep in every last one of us."" It seems to sum up the feelings of pride in spite of circumstance felt by the residents of the state. History has shown that when the city's sports teams start doing well, it's a sign of healing in Detroit. In 1968, when the Tigers won the World Series, it brought a racially divided region together after race riots. In 1984, the local economy rebounded from the recession at the same time the Tigers again won the World Series. What makes 2011 different? The Tigers' magical summer is being followed by a surprisingly solid performance from the usually underperforming Lions, behind a triple threat of quarterback Matthew Stafford, wide receiver Calvin Johnson and defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. It's not just that the Lions are winning but how they're doing it. They were down 20 points against the Minnesota Vikings on the road September 25 and then, the following Sunday, down 24 points against the Cowboys on the road. The Lions won both games, representing the city's come-from-behind spirit and fight to win in the midst of adversity. This tenacity is not lost on Schwartz, the coach, who has seen the Lions at their worst and now their best. ""When I became the Lions coach, it didn't take me long to understand what the team means to the people here,"" Schwartz said. ""No matter how bad it has been, they have never stopped caring. They are vocal but never apathetic. It's like a lawn that has been dormant. It just takes one good watering, and it's back."" Eminem's tag line in January's Chrysler ad -- ""that's who we are. That's our story"" -- sums up the motivation for these teams who know that the wins are helping Detroit's image and giving residents a sense of hope and pride that's been missing. It seems that Detroit is back -- for now.","Detroit had once been fourth largest U.S. city, with more than 1.8 million people .

"New York (CNN) -- After he graduated from college, Frankie Edgar began working for his stepfather's plumbing business. He woke up early each morning to dutifully trudge to job sites around New Jersey on the hottest and coldest of days. In the afternoon, Edgar coached wrestling. At night, he treated himself to training in his true passion: mixed martial arts. Soon Edgar told his family he wanted to quit plumbing and become a professional fighter. ""I'm not one to just drop everything and chase something that I know is not 100% sure,"" Edgar said, ""so I kept training and kept working to support myself, and eventually I got a call from the UFC,"" said Edgar, referring to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. It's the biggest mixed martial arts, or MMA, league in the United States. Edgar, whose UFC nickname is ""The Answer,"" suffered his first loss in 2008 after eight straight victories in his professional career. That loss came at the hands of undefeated opponent Gray ""The Bully"" Maynard. Edgar and Maynard's second fight in January ended in a draw. With 13 wins, one loss and one draw, Edgar is the league's lightweight champion, a title he earned in 2010. Now, just before his third match with Maynard on Saturday night in Houston, the 29-year-old Edgar said he was confident that he could beat Maynard for the first time. ""My main goal in between each fight is to become a different fighter, and I think I did that,"" Edgar said. ""As long as I show up and utilize all the improvements that I made, I'm going to come out the winner."" The sport first roped in Edgar while he watched it on television as a teen growing up in Toms River, New Jersey. ""I was pretty much content with wrestling, but I wanted to try a different avenue and still compete,"" he said. ""I thought MMA was the perfect place for me."" His mother and stepfather, he recalls, were not initially as excited by the idea of him making a living as a fighter. But once he joined the UFC in 2005, they gave their support. ""They haven't missed a fight since,"" he said. Originally called no-holds-barred fighting, variations of MMA date back to at least the late 1800s. It has transformed from a mostly underground sport that Sen. John McCain, R- Arizona, once called ""human cockfighting"" into a multibillion dollar, global industry. ""It's the fastest-growing sport in the world,"" says Mike Straka, a long-time MMA journalist and broadcaster who now works in the fight industry. ""It's the only sport that was really birthed during this generation,"" said Straka, who works at Authentic Brands Group, a developing and licensing firm, and host of a program on the company's Tapout News. California and New Jersey were the first of the major market states to regulate MMA, in 2000. Most other states have followed but the sport remains illegal in New York, Connecticut and West Virginia. A focused and steady demographic has helped MMA ""quickly become more accepted by the mainstream sports business, evolving from its relatively rogue status at its inception,"" said Rick Horrow, a visiting expert on sports law at Harvard Law School, who co-authored Beyond the Scoreboard. While the fan base is mostly youthful and is especially popular among 18-to 34-year-old men, a lot of women get into it, says Ariel Helwani, a reporter for AOL's MMAFighting.com. Reportedly worth $2 billion, the UFC says it broadcasts in more than 20 languages to nearly 600 million homes in 132 countries. Up to 300,000 people purchased the last Edgar-Maynard fight on Pay-Per-View, according to the Wrestling Observer. Saturday night's fight in HD sells for $54.99. While MMA fighters might not bring in the reported millions per bout that heavyweight boxers such as Floyd Mayweather versus Victor Ortiz saw last month, how much they earn depends on who they are and what stage of their career they are in, Straka says. Fight purses range from as little as $10,000 to $500,000 for more experienced and popular fighters, he says. For stars such as Edgar, there is also big money from sponsorships and endorsements. ""Frankie Edgar would never need to get another job if he retired tomorrow,"" Straka said. Also helping bring the sport into the mainstream is the long-running reality show ""The Ultimate Fighter,'' currently running its last season on Spike TV before switching to FX next year. The show is part of a wide-ranging multichannel UFC deal with the Fox Broadcasting Company valued at $700 million. ""It may not be the most well-known sport out there, but it's going to be,"" Edgar said. ""Everybody loves a good fight, man."" Most MMA fighters are either former NCAA wrestlers or traditional martial artists, but the sport is much different from wrestling and boxing. ""You can use practically every part of your body as a weapon,"" Straka said. MMA combatants wear 4-ounce gloves and a protective cup. They can fight standing up or on the ground and are allowed to kick and tackle their opponents. Fighters must be barefoot. Although mixed martial arts looks and sounds more violent than boxing, Straka calls it safer. ""It is the most regulated of all professional sports,"" he said, noting that fighters have to undergo physical examinations, drug testing and brain scans before every fight. Edgar says he finds his training schedule less tough than plumbing. He generally has two or three daily practices, each around two hours. That covers everything from strength training and conditioning to boxing and jiu-jitsu. ""I'm kind of on autopilot during a fight. A lot of guys have mental exercises and visualizations -- but for me, this is what I do,'' said Edgar, who weighs 155 pounds and is 5-foot-6 and has what The New York Times calls a fighter's badge of honor: cauliflower ear. The paper describes it as ""a deformity initiated by repetitive trauma,'' adding that ""cauliflower ear can crumple an outer ear to a misshapen shell.'' Some fighters are known for their showmanship inside and outside the cage, including humor and trash talk. But those who watch Edgar defend his title against Maynard on Saturday will find that what they see is what they get, Straka says. ""Frankie does all his talking inside the cage with his hands and feet -- and his heart."" For Edgar, the outlook is plain, simple and focused. ""I should be able to get up in the morning, put on a shirt and fight somebody,'' he said. ""It's like getting up and drinking a cup of coffee.""","Frankie Edgar quit plumbing to be a professional fighter .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Journalists got their first ground-level glance Saturday around Japan's stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility -- eying shells of reactor buildings, tons of contaminated water and workers scurrying still to mitigate damage from a crisis that began eight months ago. An epic 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami March 11 wreaked havoc around Japan, killing more than 15,000 people. While many of those died instantly, the East Asian nation was on edge for weeks as utility and government employees scrambled to prevent a worsening nuclear catastrophe at the Daiichi plant, located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Tokyo. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency eventually categorized the accident as a level-7 event on the international scale for nuclear disasters -- the highest level -- putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. It took months, but the Tokyo Electric Power Company (the plant's operator) eventually indicated that its workers were gaining control in the crisis. Throughout the summer and fall, there were no longer reports of explosions, nor stories about new leaks of radioactive material into the ground and sea. But the facility still remained off-limits to reporters and, for a 20-kilometer radius around the plant, to the general public due to the continued high levels of radiation and ongoing efforts to prevent yet more blasts and leaks. That temporarily changed Saturday, when about three dozen journalists traveled by bus through abandoned towns en route to the nuclear facility. They passed, for instance, withered plants at an abandoned nursery, a shattered car dealership and a gas station that had been taken over by crows. Radiation readings rose steadily as they neared the plant, including 6.7 microsieverts in Okuma. There, those on board put on respirator masks, adding to an ensemble of a protective suit, two pairs of gloves, two sets of plastic booties over their shoes and a radiation detector. At the plant's gate, the radiation reading was 20 microsieverts. The reading is still well below the threshold to mandate an immediate health risk -- 1,000 microsieverts equals 1 millisievert, and South Carolina-based medical physicist G. Donald Frey previously told CNN that radiation workers in the U.S. typically aim to be exposed to less than 5 millisieverts per year. Yet it was the cumulative effect that has prompted the continued evacuations of thousands around the Fukushima Daiichi facility. A half-dozen large cranes dominated the skyline inside the gates, while the grounds were pockmarked with vessels containing what the Tokyo Electric Power Company has said is 90,000 tons of water laced with radiation. They were visible in tanks that filled a field, as well as dozens of large, four-story tall silver tanks filled with tainted seawater. U.S., French and Japanese flags hung near a water decontamination facility, which appeared as a cluster of white tents surrounded by black sand bags. The presence of toxins didn't appear to prevent pine trees from standing, and seemingly thriving, all around the facility. Last spring was marked by regular reports of explosions, leaks and other problems at the plant. Those accounts, and radiation readings, in June led Japan's Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters to confirm that three reactors -- Nos. 1, 2 and 3 -- had experienced full meltdowns. A meltdown is a catastrophic failure of the reactor core, with a potential for widespread radiation release. The damage became starkly evident the closer one got to the heart of the nuclear facility. From afar, a new structure surrounded the No. 1 reactor building, which had lost its roof due to a massive hydrogen explosion related to overheating the day after the quake. No. 2 appeared to be intact, painted blue and white, despite a reported hydrogen detonation on March 15. The No. 3 building, meanwhile, had been diminished to a skeletal concrete frame and large pile of rubble, which crews were cleaning up with cranes ahead of it being covered by its own structure. And the No. 4 building -- whose reactor was inactive at the time of the tsunami -- also had significant damage, with one side entirely blown out, exposing the nuclear spent fuel pool. Crumpled trucks and cars, twisted metal, a gutted office building and a huge dented storage tank were visible at the base of the reactor buildings, where radiation readings stood at 1,000 microsieverts (or 1 millisievert) per hour. Some of the debris resembled what swept up elsewhere in Japan by the tsunami, while others -- like three white cars, with Tokyo Electric markings -- were more distinct to the facility. Around the plant, crows and dragonflies fluttered in the disarray. So, too, did scores of the 3,200 workers that Tokyo Electric says usually work daily at the plant. They included workers building water tanks, operating cranes, entering buildings used to store highly radioactive waste, and manning the facility's tightly contained disaster center. The challenges notwithstanding, Tokyo Electric spokesman Tetsuya Terasawa insisted vast progress has been made in recent months. He said that temperatures at the three most damaged reactors (Nos. 1, 2 and 3) were below 100 degrees Celsius, or the boiling point, a critical measure. All elements of the nuclear cooling system were perched on grounds 30 meters above the reactors, well out of the reach of any future tsunami, according to Terasawa. Addressing Fukushima Daiichi workers, Goshi Hosono -- the Japanese government's nuclear crisis manager -- said he feels relieved that the facility is becoming increasingly stable. ""Every time I come back, I feel conditions have improved. This is due to your hard work,"" Hosono said. The decommissions of Fukushima Daiichi's first four reactors will likely take more than 30 years to complete, according to a draft report released late last month by Japan's Atomic Energy Commission. The report indicated that nuclear fuel should begin to be removed by the end of 2021 -- a key, but hardly the last phase in a clean-up effort that is expected to continue for another two decades beyond that. Masao Yoshida, the man in charge of the plant, said that all the reactors have stabilized and predicted that Tokyo Electric was on track to have a cold shutdown by year's end. But he conceded that the danger is still far from over -- especially for the thousands still toiling to bring this nuclear nightmare to an end. ""Even saying it's stabilized doesn't mean that it is extremely safe,"" said Yoshida. ""When working, the radiation remains high. So when it comes to working every day, there is still danger.""","Journalists haven't been to the Fukushima Daiichi plant since the March 11 quake .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari have been fined $100,000 after Fernando Alonso kept his world title hopes alive with a controversial victory in the German Grand Prix on Sunday, though the result was allowed to stand. The two-time world champion claimed his and Ferrari's first win since the Formula One season-opener in March, but motorsport's ruling body decided that the team had broken rules banning orders to drivers after Felipe Massa let Alonso through late in the race. The race stewards have also referred the incident to the World Motor Sport Council for further consideration, the official F1 website reported. Alonso, who started second on the grid behind Sebastian Vettel, recovered after being overtaken at the beginning by Massa, who held off his surging teammate until the 49th lap of 67. Then he appeared to let the Spaniard through after being told on his radio that he was the slower of the two drivers. Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley told him: ""Alonso is faster than you. Can you confirm you understand?"" Then when Alonso went through, Smedley added: ""Good lad -- just stick with it now, sorry."" It appeared to be a tactical decision by the Italian outfit, with Brazilian Massa trailing Alonso by 31 points in the overall standings before the race. Alonso, who also won in Bahrain, stayed in fifth place but closed to within 34 points of leader Lewis Hamilton with eight races left. He pulled clear to win by 4.1 seconds, twice setting the fastest lap of the race. F1 championship standings after Hockenheim . Massa held on for second place for his best result of the season since Bahrain, with German Vettel third and teammate Mark Webber sixth as Red Bull failed to follow up the latter's victory last time out at Silverstone. The race came a year to the day after Massa suffered a horrific head injury after an accident in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix which ruled him out for the rest of the season. After the race, he refused to criticize his team about the incident but looked visibly disappointed and would not elaborate on how he felt about the events -- while Ferrari denied that rules had been broken. Was Schumacher's return a big mistake? Massa told reporters: ""I don't need to say anything about that. He passed me. We're doing a good job for the team."" Hamilton, the 2008 world champion, finished fourth to be on 157 points -- extending his lead to 14 over McLaren teammate Jenson Button, who was fifth. The Red Bull drivers were left level on 136 points in third and fourth. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said he believed Ferrari had broken the rules. ""The drivers should have been allowed to race. Massa did the better job. He was in the lead and the regulations are pretty clear -- team orders are not allowed,"" he told UK race broadcaster the BBC before the fine was announced. ""I have to say that is the clearest team order I've ever seen. It will be interesting to see what the stewards make of it because for me it was as clear as 2002, which is why the rule was brought in. It's wrong for the sport."" In 2002, Ferrari told Rubens Barrichello to let Michael Schumacher pass in the closing stages of the Austrian Grand Prix. But Schumacher, who finished ninth on his return to a race he has won four times, said he believed his former team made the right move. ""I understand 100 percent and I would do exactly the same -- what are we here for? We're fighting for the championship,"" the 41-year-old said. Renault's Robert Kubica claimed seventh place at Hockenheim, but it was a disappointing day for Mercedes on the German team's home track as Nico Rosberg was eighth ahead of seven-time world champion Schumacher. Kubica's Russian teammate Vitaly Petrov claimed the final point on offer in 10th place.","Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso wins the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim .

"(CNN) -- Capt. Tadeusz Wrona still has trouble sleeping. The night after executing a spectacular belly landing in Poland, the veteran pilot tossed and turned until 4 a.m. The phone kept ringing, he told Polish media, and he kept reliving the chilling moments when his crew and passengers came close to a disaster. Now basking in his nation's adoration and fielding countless interview requests, Wrona is resting even less, he said with a weary smile. Wrona, who has worked for LOT Polish Airlines for 20 years, was at the controls of a Boeing 767 en route from Newark, New Jersey, to Warsaw on Tuesday when he realized there was a problem with the landing gear. When the second attempt to open it failed, he knew that everyone on board -- 220 passengers and 11 crew -- was in danger. ""I've maybe flown this plane 500 times, and the landing gear deployed every time,"" Wrona said during a news conference in Warsaw on Wednesday. ""I never had any trouble flying Boeing."" Aware of comparisons to the 2009 ""Miracle on the Hudson,"" when Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed a plane in New York's Hudson River after a flock of geese damaged both of the aircraft's engines, Wrona pointed out that his situation was less dire. Both of his engines were working fine and there was time to prepare. After notifying Warsaw's airport that there might be an emergency landing, the crew had time to perform checks and various functions, Wrona said. They circled the city to burn off excess fuel. While the crew reviewed the procedure in the cockpit, the flight attendants prepared the cabin, instructing passengers that they would have to evacuate as soon as the plane stopped on the ground. The autopilot helped the crew guide the plane until about two minutes before landing, Wrona said. That's when he took manual control. ""We rested the plane on three points: two engines plus the rear portion of the fuselage,"" Wrona said. ""We tried to do it delicately, and we were successful."" There was less noise during the belly landing than a normal touch down, which shocked Wrona. It was just quiet, he recalled. Wrona, who has been dubbed the Polish version of Sullenberger, was praised by the original ""miracle"" pilot. ""The captain and the crew obviously did a great job,"" Sullenberger told CNN. ""It definitely requires skill to do this well, and from all reports and from watching the video, it looked like it was done very, very well."" But for Wrona, there were still tense moments ahead. ""When the plane stopped on the runway, I wasn't sure whether everyone was safe, because smoke appeared,"" he recalled. (Wind had blown the smoke caused by the friction of the landing toward the cockpit.) ""I finally felt full relief only when the purser reported that the cabin was empty."" Everyone got out safe and unhurt. Like Sullenberger, Wrona is now grappling with sudden fame and the gratitude of hundreds of families. He's a Facebook star, with several fan pages established in his honor. One page has more than 33,000 followers leaving messages of praise and adulation. But Wrona insists it's too much to call him a national hero. ""I am convinced that all of us who work for LOT would do the exact same thing, and it would end in the same way, because we train for such situations on simulators,"" he said. Wrona is fully prepared to return to his duties as pilot, he said. In fact, his schedule -- prepared before the incident -- has him flying to Hanoi, Vietnam, on Saturday. He's not sure whether the commission investigating the emergency landing will let him go. Wrona's wife and two adult children beamed when they were interviewed by Polish media on Thursday. Marzena Wrona found out about her husband's troubled flight on television while the plane was still circling Warsaw and raced to the airport to watch the emergency landing, she told the program DzieÃâ Dobry TVN. But she had to turn back when authorities closed off many streets leading to the airport as a safety precaution. When she got back home, the plane had already landed. ""I knew the landing would be successful because I couldn't imagine otherwise,"" Wrona's wife said.","Pilot who executed a textbook belly landing in Poland is being hailed as national hero .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo expects the Italian team to improve on their record of just one grand prix win in 2011 when the Formula One season resumes later this month.

"Dresden, Germany (CNN) -- Wouldn't it be great if you could simply grab carbon dioxide from the air and turn it back into fuel? According to Germany-based renewable energy start-up Sunfire, you can. ""In fact, the idea has been around since at least the 70s,"" says Christian von Olshausen, the company's Chief Technology Officer. But the process is expensive. ""For as long as fossil fuels have been cheap and readily available, there's not been sufficient demand,"" he adds. Now -- with the world's finite stock of crude oil on the wane, and amidst pressure to reduce global carbon dioxide (C02) emissions -- the idea of converting those very carbons back into what Olshausen calls ""synthetic fuels"" is becoming more financially viable. ""The combustion of synthetic fuel does not increase the amount of C02 in the atmosphere,"" he explains. ""This is because the carbon is being continuously recycled."" Synthetic fuel can come in the form of everything from diesel to gasoline to wax. But while the process is simple in theory (see factbox), it is unwieldy in practice -- demanding ultra-high temperatures which gobble up electricity. ""The operation is only practical now that we have relatively cheap sources of renewable electricity to power it,"" says Olshausen. Using conventional electricity was never an option, he adds, after all ""what's the point of turning carbon into fuel if the electricity you're using to do it burns up more carbon than you started with?"" But this highlights an uncomfortable fact: Sunfire's synthetic fuel contains only 70% of the energy that goes into making it, as heat is lost during the process. So, why waste hard-won green electricity to produce old-fashioned petrol? Dr. Jeff Hardy is head of the UK's National Energy Research Network (NERN). He says that, while all efforts should be made to reduce our dependence on liquid fuels, it may not be possible for some industries: . ""The thing with fuel is that it offers very high density energy storage ... for areas like long haul aviation, it's hard to see what could replace it."" According to the CIA World Factbook, global oil consumption is currently about 30 billion barrels a year. Hardy points out that, even if we reduce our thirst for fossil fuels to just one or two percent of this figure over the next century, we may still need millions of barrels for things like commercial flight that are unable to use electricity for power. Could synthetic fuel really plug that gap? At present, Sunfire is moving out of the lab and is talking to car and aircraft-makers in the hope of increasing fuel production to an industrial scale. They are aiming for production to hit one barrel a day within the next few years. If that doesn't sound like a lot, that's because it's not. ""This is going to be a long process,"" admits Olshausen. ""I'd estimate that it will take between one to two decades before we can replace a single digit percent of current demand (for fuel)."" The problem, he says, is developing materials that can resist extraordinarily high temperatures for long periods of time without degrading. ""But we'll do it,"" insists Olshausen. ""Many innovations in the past century, like the car or the computer, have had to overcome seemingly impossible thermodynamic obstacles."" Swiss engineer Dominique Kronenberg is certainly hoping that companies like Sunfire will be successful in the long run. He is chief operating officer of Climeworks, a firm that specializes in capturing carbon from the air. ""The question is, what do we do with the carbon once we've got it?"" he asks. ""At present, the main markets are quite niche -- things like carbonated fizzy drinks, computer cooling systems and industrial greenhouses."" It's no surprise then that Kronenberg and his team have been working with Sunfire to flesh out the logistics of a future partnership. The potential market, he says, is a huge and ""much more profitable than storing the carbon underground, that's for sure.""","German company created process to turn carbon dioxide from air into liquid fuel .

"United Nations (CNN) -- World leaders kicked off a historic two-day meeting at the United Nations on Monday by unanimously approving a ""political declaration"" meant to stem a rising tide of noncommunicable diseases, now the world's leading killer. It is only the second time a health issue has been debated at a special meeting of the General Assembly after the group's pledge to take on AIDS a decade ago. ""This is a landmark meeting,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. ""Three out of every five people on Earth die from the diseases that we gather here to address."" Illnesses that range from diabetes to heart disease to cancer are increasingly reaching developing nations, Ban said, which are often ill-equipped to provide the kinds of medicines and levels of treatment to offset their effects. ""More than a quarter of all people who die from (such diseases) succumb in the prime of their lives,"" he added. ""The vast majority live in developing countries."" The measure is expected to be adopted in full after a second day of discussion Tuesday. But it will then depend on cooperation from companies that produce food, alcohol and tobacco products to implement broad-sweeping policy shifts to achieve lasting changes that U.N. members say they are hoping for. World Health Organization Director-General Margaret Chan called the issue a ""slow-motion disaster,"" citing one study that put the cost of noncommunicable diseases to the global economy at $30 trillion by 2030. The effect on individual households, analysts say, is often manifest in reduced physical capacities, long-term treatment and high health care costs. On the national scale, the effect is more clear. Associated costs for heart disease, stroke and diabetes in China alone amounted to $18 billion in 2005, according to a U.N. statement. Russia expended $11 billion that year, while India spent $9 billion and Brazil spent $3 billion. A year later, 36 million people died from noncommunicable diseases worldwide, representing nearly two-thirds of all reported global deaths. Chan said the rise of these diseases is being driven by urbanization and ""unhealthy lifestyles,"" prompted by systemic use of alcohol, tobacco and readily available processed foods. ""For a growing number of people, (those foods) are the quickest ways to fill their stomachs,"" she said. Meanwhile, global obesity levels have doubled since 1980, according to a recent report. ""Obesity is the signal that something is terribly wrong,"" said Chan, who urged a systemic approach among world governments to combat those diseases. Traditionally more widespread in developed nations, obesity -- which, according to reports, is often a product of poor health practices and available food choices -- has increasingly spread to developing nations. Death and illness from noncommunicable diseases are greater threats than transmissible diseases like malaria and HIV in every region except Africa, where they are on the rise, according to a U.N. report. Ban on Monday called for a more comprehensive intervention plan to help reduce the threat, asking for ""tobacco-control measures, including raising taxes and bans on advertising and smoking in public places; raising taxes on alcohol and enforcing bans on alcohol advertising; reducing salt intake,"" as well as replacing trans fats in foods with polyunsaturated fats. He called on member countries to promote public awareness about diet and physical activity, deliver hepatitis B vaccinations and encourage preventive care through counseling. ""It is our collective responsibility to make this meeting a success for all mankind,"" said Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who attended Monday's meeting.","U.N. members vow to reduce diabetes, heart disease, cancer .

"Washington (CNN) -- An expanded team of civilian technical experts from a ""quick-reaction force"" is on the ground in Libya, tracking down and destroying ""MANPADs,"" shoulder-fired, heat-seeking missiles that the U.S. fears could be used to bring down a civilian airliner. The United States currently has a State Department officer and 14 technical experts who are embedded with munitions and destruction teams from Libya's National Transitional Council, according to Andrew Shapiro, assistant U.S. secretary of state for political-military affairs. Officials hope to ramp up the search effort ""significantly,"" Shapiro said, with the number of specialists on the ground increasing to 50. The joint teams are sweeping, surveying and securing stockpiles of the weapons that were previously under control of the Moammar Gadhafi regime. The joint teams already have surveyed 20 out of 36 known ammunition storage sites, a State Department official said, and have disabled or destroyed hundreds of MANPADs. The official was not authorized to speak on the record. At each site they have found from several dozen to several hundred storage bunkers. The United States estimates there were as many as 20,000 surface-to-air missiles in Libya when NATO began its operations to aid rebels in ousting Gadhafi. Shapiro declined to say how many weapons might be missing, but U.S. Gen. Carter Ham, commander of U.S. Africa Command, expressed concern that the missiles could be crossing the border. ""There are some worrying indicators ... that some of these portable air defense systems have left Libya,"" Ham said, adding that he didn't have enough information to know how many have possibly moved, ""but there's enough ... churn out there in the information I see to cause me to be very concerned."" U.S. officials are working with Libya's neighbors on ""how best to address this threat,"" Shapiro said. The United States is distributing thousands of pamphlets in multiple languages, including Arabic and English, to neighboring countries, including Egypt, Algeria and Morocco, to inform their border guards what the MANPADs look like and to be on watch for any attempts to move them out of Libya. Ham noted that the MANPADs are a threat ""to anything that flies,"" including commercial airliners upon takeoff and landing. The United States also is working through NATO to alert the Libyans to stockpiles NATO was aware of and may have targeted during the conflict. ""When it comes to the conventional weapons destruction challenge, the NTC have not only have talked the talk, they've walked the walk,"" the State Department official said. ""They have really taken leadership on this and we are committed to helping them secure the weapons stockpiles."" The U.S. experts involved in the operation are mostly retired military personnel who were specialists in munitions handling and ordnance destruction at the Department of Defense, Shapiro said. Many of them work with nongovernmental organizations on de-mining. Shapiro noted the United States paid $3 million to two non-governmental organizations in Libya ""to help secure weapons that they discovered.""

"(CNN) -- Former Philippines President Gloria Arroyo was stopped from boarding a plane at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport Tuesday, hours after the country's Supreme Court overruled government-imposed restrictions on her travels. The Philippines government fears that Arroyo, who is facing allegations of corruption and electoral fraud, will flee if allowed to leave the country. But the Supreme Court ruled 8-5 in favor of a temporary restraining order on the travel ban, declaring it was unconstitutional as Arroyo has yet to be formally charged with a crime. A Supreme Court spokesman, Midas Marquez, told reporters the court's ruling was ""consistent with the constitutional presumption of innocence."" Arroyo was reportedly boarding the flight to seek medical treatment abroad for her bone disease diagnosed earlier this year, following three unsuccessful spinal operations in the Philippines. She arrived at the airport in an ambulance and was transported to the departure gate in a wheelchair while wearing a neck brace. Arroyo's lawyer, Raul Lambino, told CNN that the former first couple was ""subjected to indignity and embarrassment at the airport"", calling the government's defiance of the Supreme Court order ""abhorrent and in violation of the rights of the individual guaranteed by the (Philippine's) constitution and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" But presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda described the situation as ""all high drama,"" according to media reports. ""They (the Arroyos) want the public to sympathize with them,"" he added. He said that while the Arroyo couple would be treated with dignity, the government would be ""firm in our decision not to allow them to leave the country."" Arroyo's husband, Jose Miguel Arroyo, is also accused of corruption. The Supreme Court, which is mostly staffed by judges hired under Arroyo, defied current President Benigno Aquino's stated mandate of investigating allegations of corruption during Arroyo's 2001-2010 presidential term. Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said the government intends to appeal the court's decision. Lambino told CNN that even though the government plans to file a motion for reconsideration, its defiance of the Supreme Court order yesterday was nevertheless ""illegal.""","Former Philippines president Gloria Arroyo stopped from boarding plane at Manila airport .

"(CNN) -- The news of Vaclav Havel's death Sunday morning caught me by surprise, but it was hardly surprising. When I last talked to the Czech playwright, politician and statesman was in March, at a party to celebrate the Prague premiere of a movie he'd directed of his final play, ""Leaving."" He was already very frail. Ever since 1996, when he lost half a lung to cancer after a lifetime of heavy smoking, he had seemed to be living on borrowed time. He'd been in the hospital several times since then, and had one or two near-death experiences, but he always managed to bounce back, and I wasn't alone in thinking he might be practically invincible. In March, I was on my way to Egypt to take a closer look at the Arab Awakening, and I wanted Havel's permission to try to find someone in Cairo to translate his most influential essay -- 1978's ""The Power of the Powerless,"" about non-violent opposition to tyranny -- into Arabic. That essay had inspired the creation of the anti-Communist Solidarity trade union in Poland, and continues to give strength to dissidents in Cuba, China, and Burma who are longing for peaceful change. I thought some Arab readers might find it useful as well. Before the premiere, Havel had been in the hospital yet again, but here he was now, sitting on a couch, a plaid scarf around his neck, sipping a glass of wine and working his way through what seemed like an endless line of people wanting to wish him well. He seemed small, a shadow of the man who, in his prime, could talk to kings and presidents and rock stars and command a world stage. When my turn came, I sat down beside him, congratulated him on the movie -- his first (and now only) foray into that medium -- and then put the question to him. His voice was so low I had to lean in close to hear him. He gave me his blessing, and then said, ""But do you think the Arabs are ready for democracy?"" His question caught me off guard, but I finally managed a reply: ""I have no idea, but Vasek, were you guys ready for democracy back in 1989?"" He smiled, and said, ""I see your point."" The most amazing thing about those 1989 revolutions was not just how quickly they unfolded, but how much sheer improvisation went on. Havel led an ad-hoc group called the Civic Forum that, within ten short days, managed to negotiate the Communist party out of power. They had no real idea what they were doing, and there were no guarantees about the outcome. On the other hand, you could argue that Havel's entire life -- and the life of his peers -- had been one long preparation for that moment. Havel, who died peacefully Sunday morning in his country home in north-east Bohemia, leaves behind so many legacies it's hard to know where to begin. In the 1950s, he was an experimental poet; in the 1960s, a master essayist, radical playwright and feisty magazine editor; in the 1970s, an underground publisher, human rights activist, and ultimately a prisoner. And -- perhaps holding it all together -- he was a bon-viveur who loved wine and company and could bring people together in an atmosphere of camaraderie and good cheer. He brought all these qualities into the Prague Castle as president, first of Czechoslovakia and then, after the country broke up in 1993, of the Czech Republic. He also remained, paradoxically, a very shy and gentle man with a will of steel, who was fearless when confronting a regime that tried, relentlessly, to crush his spirit, and who, to the very end of his tenure in office, suffered from stage-fright each time he had to entertain a head of state, or speak in public. Above all, he was an intellectual who believed that words were not enough. A favorite saying of his was, ""Having posited A, I must therefore posit B."" By that he meant that if you have ideas about how to change the status quo, you have an obligation to muck in and help bring that change about. One of the most important turning points in his long career came back in the mid-1970s when he joined forces with Ivan Jirous, the leading figure in a musical underground that challenged the regime's cultural totalitarianism at its very core. When the Plastic People of the Universe, the rock band Jirous was managing (and for whom I played for a while) were arrested in 1976, Havel and his companions sprang to their defense. I believe it was at this point that Havel became a true ""dissident,"" as the late Christopher Hitchens defined the term: someone who is willing to put his own comfort and safety at serious risk for the sake of his ideas. Havel's defense of the musical underground morphed into the human rights movement called Charter 77, and a related organization, The Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted. The regime shucked its kid gloves, and Havel spent over four years in prison, and suffered many more years of intrusive police surveillance. He was not alone, of course, but his example made it easier for others to follow. His treatment by the regime permanently undermined his health, but his resistance also provided inspiration for a new generation of dissenters that came to fore in 1989. During the Velvet Revolution, on December 7, 1989, in the fabled Magic Lantern Theatre where Havel and the Civic Forum had their headquarters, he was asked by a journalist what political lessons he had learned in his years as a dissident. ""I'd have to think about it,"" Havel replied, ""but there's one lesson I could mention right now. When you try to act in accordance with your conscience, when you try to speak the truth, when you try to behave like a citizen, even in conditions where citizenship is degraded, it won't necessarily lead anywhere, but it might. There's one thing, however, that will never lead anywhere, and that is speculating that your behavior will have a specific outcome."" I did eventually find an Arabic translator for Havel's essay, and it will be coming out in an anthology of his work to be published in Cairo sometime next year. It won't necessarily lead anywhere, but then again, you never know. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Wilson.","A long-time friend of Vaclav Havel's remembers him as fearless against the regime .

"(CNN) -- The death of longtime Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi is shaking the Arab world. And nations like Egypt, which next month holds its first parliamentary elections since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak in February, are watching. Egypt, like Tunisia -- which holds elections this weekend -- needs a great many positive influences to consolidate its nascent democratic government. If Libya's National Transitional Council should turn in a militant Islamist direction and become hostile to the European Union or the United States, it could jeopardize democratic progress in Tunis and Cairo alike. Egypt's position is precarious enough as it is. Two weeks ago in Cairo, for example, Coptic Christian protesters clashed with security forces, leaving 25 dead and more than 300 injured. The violence stems from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces' refusal to share key decision-making powers with civilians and tests its ability to manage the country's fragile political transition. Today in Egypt, no political faction is strong enough to monopolize power and none is weak enough to be ground out of existence. As a result, the army's failure to build a solid political consensus creates a recipe for ongoing confrontation. As long as Egyptians believe they stand to gain more through violence than peaceful political negotiations, the situation in Cairo will worsen. Three decades ago, after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the Ayatollah Khomeini wasted no time in enacting a brutal purge of the country's secular military elites, whom he feared would endanger his rule. In refusing to establish a new order that Egypt's most powerful political constituencies can all get behind, the Egyptian army may now be leading itself in the same direction. The army's stubbornness in refusing to craft a new constitution before holding elections at the end of November is ill-considered and dangerous. The coming parliament will be charged with choosing 100 experts to draft the new constitution. But Christians and secularists fear that an Islamist-dominated parliament will produce a constitution that discriminates against them. Having had little more than six months of freedom, most Egyptian political parties are still in their infancy, and the older secular parties are not yet ready for elections. Islamist parties are the best prepared, as they have been well funded, are known across the country and have enjoyed most of the coverage in the state-owned media since the fall of Mubarak. Yet secularists -- who constitute 70% or perhaps 80% of Egypt's political parties -- asked for more time to prepare for elections and for the military to facilitate an agreement on a bill of rights that sets down guiding principles for the new constitution. Islamists oppose such a move, as they fear it would create rules the secularists could use to oppress them. As a provisional government, the army must create a new political framework that guarantees majority rule while protecting the rights of religious, ethnic and political minorities. Yet in spite of a worsening domestic situation, the military shows no such desire. After Mubarak's fall, Egyptians hoped the army would be the guarantor of a democratic transition; that it would do this transparently, sharing power with civilian political groups, and presiding over a convention culminating in a modern, democratic constitution that protects every Egyptian individual and political group that rejects violence. In late July, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces sent a worrisome signal when it celebrated National Day, the anniversary of the 1952 coup d'etat in which the military took power. This coup smothered Egypt's nascent democratic process in its cradle and ushered in an era of military rule lasting almost six decades. After the coup, military men in civilian attire rigged every election, abused human rights and monopolized the political system. In years past, National Day was nothing out of the ordinary -- the country had celebrated it every year for almost six decades -- but this year, it signaled the military's intention to backpedal on political reforms and maintain an undemocratic status quo. The 1952 regime has hidden behind many different ideologies and adopted a range of different national and international alliances to suit its needs. It began as a capitalist government, allied with the West, turned to Moscow and became socialist in the 1960s, then adopted a mixture of socialism and capitalism in the late '70s, and allied itself with Washington. Yet in no incarnation was the military-backed regime ever democratic. Until Egypt's rulers reject the order established in the 1952 military coup, the country will never move forward toward genuine democracy. Ongoing protests and rising violence are not a coincidence. They are the fruits of 60 years of failed policies. If Egyptians could be confident in their political futures -- that they would be subject to the rule of law rather than the rule of man -- they would be less frustrated. If they could be sure that the country's new political order would respect their individual rights and liberties, they would no longer be in the streets. If a new constitution ensured that Islamists, Christians, secularists, men and women alike all enjoyed equal rights, then maybe violence and protests would not be the way to be heard. If the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces respected its mandate to establish the rules of the game, and then shared power with political parties, Egyptians would be confident that it sought only to preserve rule of law and public order, not to perpetuate its own rule. Egyptian military elites can take comfort that they will not meet the same end as Gadhafi, nor that of the Iranian military after the fall of the shah. But they should take the latest violence very seriously, as they are in a far more delicate position than they may realize. They cannot continue to manage the country's transition the way that they have. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Khairi Abaza.","Khairi Abaza: Gadhafi's death has resonated in Arab Spring countries like Egypt, Tunisia .

"(CNN) -- Former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas has spoken of his relief at finally making public the fact he is gay -- and now wants to become a role model for gay people in sport. Speaking to British news channel ITN, Thomas revealed why it has taken him so long to speak openly about his sexuality. ""Every gay man will tell you that 'coming out' is like a weight lifted from your shoulders and beng able to walk down the street knowing that there is nothing for me to hide has been a liberating experience, "" admitted Thomas -- the most capped player in Wales history with 100 appearances for his country. ""I knew I was gay at 18, but to come out then would have meant I would not have achieved what I did in rugby. I loved rugby so much and it was so important to me that I made the decision to keep my sexuality secret. People may disagree with that, but it was my belief and my decision. ""Since my announcement I have had an amazing response and have not had one negative comment or any abuse. I think it proves there is a place for gay men in every walk of life. ""Gay men are accepted in films, music and politics because people came out and broke the mould and stereotype in those industries. ""What I am trying to do is break the trend in rugby and sport in general and show any aspiring sportsman, regardless of his age, that the mould has been broken.

"(LonelyPlanet.com) -- Despite the daily foot traffic, Lower Manhattan is one of the most under-appreciated parts of New York City. It's not just a playground for suits bound for Wall Street bank jobs or tourists following the old New Amsterdam crooked plan through skyscraper canyons heading to the Statue of Liberty -- or, increasingly over the coming months, crowding to get a glimpse of the new 9/11 Memorial. As someone who has spent most of the last two decades in New York City, I can't begin to count the number of times visiting friends and friends of friends have asked me for ""fun things to do in New York City."" The hidden sides of Lower Manhattan fit the bill. If you're heading to visit the 9/11 Memorial and are looking for other things to do in the area, try these tips: . LonelyPlanet.com: 40 free attractions in New York City . 1. Trinity Church's gravestones . New York's most historic church, dating from 1698, faces Wall Street from Broadway. Visitors often pop in to see the stained glass and perhaps peek into the free museum (which includes a cut-out $10 bill so you can pose as Alexander Hamilton). The Hamilton focus is there because the country's first US Secretary of Treasury -- who was shot in a duel by the former Vice President Aaron Burr in 1804 (no, Dick Cheney wasn't the first VP to shoot someone) -- is buried outside. But that's not the best part of the cemetery. On the bigger plot, on the north side of the church, there are shady spots to sit, and at the far northeastern corner lies James Leeson, who left a coded message atop his tombstone. According to Kevin Walsh's superb book ""Forgotten New York,"" the code was finally cracked nearly a century after his death in 1794. The message: ""Remember death."" 2. National Museum of the American Indian . Manhattan got its name from the Lenape word for either ""place of hills"" or ""place of inebriation"" (the latter is certainly more apt in the past few hundred years), and Broadway itself follows old hunting trails that date centuries before Henry Hudson wandered this way. A great place to learn more about all of the Americas' pre-Columbian inhabitants is this free, relatively quiet museum. Part of the Smithsonian (and open every day), the exhibit of artifacts fills the gorgeous century-old Customs House. Many equate Native Americans with images seen in old westerns -- usually wearing the attire of the Plains Indians, evident in a shirt that may have been worn by Sioux legend Crazy Horse. The ""Infinity of Nations"" exhibit gives a fuller picture. I also enjoyed thumbing through Native American newspapers from around the country and seeing works like a painting by Naiche, a Chiricahua Apache ""prisoner-of-war"" at Fort Sill, Oklahoma a century ago. 3. Stone Street dining . I'm always shocked by how many people eat lunch at unmemorable places on Broadway or chains at South Street Seaport. Locals instead bee-line for the city's first paved street, Stone Street, a small traffic-free winding lane filled with covered tables a few blocks east of Broadway (and south of Wall Street), lined with good food and bars. It gets BUSY on weekday lunches (noon to 1:30 p.m.) and as work winds down (after 4 p.m.). Go then, and share an outside table. I like Adrienne's Pizza Bar (54 Stone St.) the best, but it comes in one big size -- don't go solo. LonelyPlanet.com: How to cycle NYC like a pro . 4. Rat Alley . OK, most people won't want to walk down Edens Alley, an L-shaped alley near the corner of Gold Street and Fulton Street, en route from the World Trade Center site to South Street Seaport. But it's legendary. In 2001, Robert Sullivan spent many nights here for four seasons, watching a terrifying scene of ""relay teams"" of eight to 10 rats storming into garbage bags that roared like ""a bar brawl in a pup tent."" Sullivan's book, ""Rats,"" is creepily fascinating, giving more info than you may want to know about New York's most famous ""wildlife."" You won't see rats during the day. (By the way, Fulton Street is a common path for visitors to take -- and its scene of chains and discount shops is very simply the least interesting walking street in all of Lower Manhattan.) 5. African Burial Ground National Monument . One of New York's newest museums -- the fascinating African Burial Ground National Monument site built in a new Federal Building in 2010 -- sees, on a good day, about 250 people. Go. You may be alone, and you might not see New York the same way afterward. During most of the 18th century, as many as 15,000 Africans -- mostly slaves -- were buried in this 6.6-acre corner of the city, and the small museum makes a big impact with the corner of the Federal Hall it occupies. Watch the 20-minute film (""this is African Americans' Ellis Island,"" one person says in it) and walk past some of the over 400 graves found while building this controversial building in the '90s. This is the population who really built the city, including a giant wooden barrier wall to protect New Amsterdam from the British attack -- the namesake for Wall Street. Around the corner, just east along Duane Street, there's a small plot saved from the building plans with a monument to those buried here -- along with visible mounds of crypts underground.

"London (CNN) -- Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have increased this year, particularly over Bahrain and Syria, and relations are likely to worsen on the news of the alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington. But ironically, the rise of more representative governments in key Arab countries poses risks to both Iran and Saudi Arabia. While each country will seek to defend its allies against uprisings (for Saudi Arabia, the Bahraini ruling family; and for Iran, the Syrian regime), neither will be able to control or dominate the changing regional dynamics -- and both have reasons to worry about the risk of unrest at home. The news comes at a time when regional relationships are in flux. The ongoing domestic political changes in a number of key countries -- especially Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria -- will create new foreign alliances and rivalries. There are few certainties. It is not yet clear whether these countries will become democratic in the near future, or which parties will be empowered. New political players have plenty of domestic challenges to absorb their attention and won't necessarily be focused on foreign policy for some time. With these caveats, however, here are four predictions about the new Arab order. 1) Dividing the region into two ""camps"" is an oversimplification . In recent years, many analysts and policy makers saw a ""pro-Western"" camp, led by Saudi Arabia and Egypt, opposed to a self-styled ""resistance"" camp of Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas. But new political players will probably want to avoid being forced into these old categories. Emerging political players in Egypt and Tunisia, whether Islamist or secular, generally do not want their countries to look like either Saudi Arabia or Iran. Representative governments would not be as reflexively pro-Western as their predecessors. They are likely to be more pro-Palestinian,and more sympathetic to the fact that Hamas and Hezbollah are both popularly-elected movements, but they will also be wary of Iran. Analysts have also written about the countries of the revolution versus the countries of the counter-revolution, meaning the Gulf states. But the Gulf states have backed the uprising in Libya and have withdrawn their support from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- indicating that they will not necessarily act as a conservative force throughout the region. 2) Egyptian-Saudi rivalry will be a defining feature . In the 1950s and 1960s, Egypt and Saudi Arabia were major regional rivals, with Egypt representing pan-Arab nationalism, socialism and sympathy for the ""non-aligned"" movement, while Saudi Arabia was a more traditional, pro-US monarchy. The two countries backed opposing sides in the Yemeni civil war, while Egyptian political philosophy inspired leftist movements throughout the Gulf. Egypt is witnessing a resurgent nationalism and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that Saudi Arabia is unpopular among Egyptians, particularly given reports that the Saudi king wanted to help former president Hosni Mubarak stay in power, which would probably have required the Egyptian military to fire on civilian protesters. Egypt is also the only Arab country that can rival Saudi Arabia's influence on the pan-Arab media, with the partial exception of Qatar (where al-Jazeera is a single broadcaster rather than a media hub). This renewed rivalry will take time to materialize. In the short term, Egypt's foreign policy is likely to remain constrained by the persistent power of the army. At the same time, Saudi Arabia's foreign policy is constrained by domestic preoccupations, including the political succession, and by the fact that key foreign policy players are ageing. Saudi Arabia is unlikely to have the capacity to act as a regional ""counter-revolution sponsor"" even if it wants to. 3) Iraq will rise as a foreign policy player . Since 2003, Iraq has been consumed with its internal problems and has had little capacity to be a foreign policy player. However, this year, Iraqi politicians have taken vocal positions on Bahrain -- opposing the crackdown and expressing their concern about the risk of exacerbating regional sectarian tensions -- and on Syria, with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki calling on Syria's President Bashar al-Assad to end the one-party rule of the Ba'ath party there. As one of the larger countries in the region, with nearly twice as many citizens as Saudi Arabia, and as a major oil producer, Iraq will expect to be a regional diplomatic heavyweight once again. Importantly, Iraq's current oil production targets are likely to create tensions within OPEC, particularly with Saudi Arabia and with Iran. Iraqi officials have recently said they should revise down their existing ambitious oil production targets, which would see the country producing 12 million barrels a day by 2017 -- more than Saudi Arabia currently produces. But even the revised level of eight million barrels a day recently suggested by the oil minister would mean Iraq produced more oil than Iran -- and almost as much as Saudi Arabia. 4) Arab uprisings pose risks to both the Iranian and Saudi models of government . While neither Iran or Saudi Arabia would be enamored of the comparison, neither is a democracy. Both have authoritarian governments that claim religious legitimacy; and in both cases, significant segments of the growing youth population that are dissatisfied with the political and social restrictions that they face. Iran and Saudi have backed different uprisings this year. Iran has expressed support for the uprising in Bahrain, which was repressed with Saudi help, while following severe state violence against protesters in Syria, Saudi Arabia has broken off diplomatic relations with President al-Assad of Syria, Iran's key Arab ally. But both the Iranian and the Saudi governments have mixed feelings about the political transitions in Egypt, Tunisia and Egypt. If these latter countries emerge as successful democracies -- which is still a big if -- they are likely to offer more inspiring models for future Arab development than either Saudi Arabia or Iran can offer. Indeed, it is the lack of existing models in the Arab region that explains why so many Arabs regard the Turkish government with such enthusiasm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Kinninmont.","Kinninmont: Dividing region into two 'camps' is too simple .

"(CNN) -- Two goals in five minutes at the start of extra-time helped defending champions Egypt book their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals with a battling 3-1 victory over Cameroon. The game, though, was marred by a controversial third goal by midfielder Ahmed Hassan which was allowed to stand by referee Jerome Damon despite replays showing the ball had clearly not crossed the line. By that time the Pharaohs' captain, who was winning a record 170th cap for his country, had already scored an own goal to put the Indomitable Lions ahead after 26 minutes. Hassan scored again at the other end to pull his side level with a powerful long-range strike before half-time which eventually forced the game into an additional 30 minutes in Benguela. Substitute Mohamed Gedo then capitalized on an error from Geremi Njitap to put Egypt ahead in extra-time, before Hassan's controversial strike handed them a two-goal cushion. To make matters worse for Paul Le Guen's Cameroon, Aurelien Chedjou was sent off late on as the north Africans set up a tantalising last-four clash with old foes Algeria. Cameroon took the lead following a spell of intense pressure. A succession of Achille Emana corners had the Egyptian defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in Hassan's weak-header on the line dropping into his own net. Cameroon pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when Hassan unleashed a fierce 35-yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni before finding its way in. Emad Moteab could have won the game for Egypt right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from Hassan, but the Al-Ahly forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time. However, Hassan Shehata's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3-1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals. The first came  when Geremi's poor back-pass from the right was intercepted by Gedo, who and tucked away with ease through the legs of Kameni two minutes after the resumption. The second seems certain to land South African referee Damon in the spotlight after Hassan's free-kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the Espanyol goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground. However, it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the Cameroon players. It also seemed to knock the stuffing out of Le Guen's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes. To add insult to injury, Chedjou was shown a straight red for hauling down last-man Gedo midway through the second period of extra-time with Egypt going on to seal a memorable win. Meanwhile, Nigeria became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating Zambia in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in Lubango. Neither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, but Nigeria progressed 5-4 on penalties and will now face near-neighbors Ghana in the last four on Thursday. Goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama scored the decisive penalty for Nigeria after Thomas Nyirenda had missed for Zambia. Enyeama dived to his right to stop Nyirenda's penalty after Sikombe Chivhuta and Christopher Katongo and Emmanuel Mayuka had all scored for Zambia. Obefemi Martins, Victor Nsofor, Peter Odemwingie, and John Obi Mikel all scored for Nigeria.","Defending champions Egypt book their place in the African Nations Cup semifinal in Angola .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The power of women hit the State Department on Wednesday when first lady Michelle Obama joined Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to celebrate champions of women's rights around the world. Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton present the State Department Women of Courage Awards. The event was to celebrate the State Department Women of Courage Awards, but highlighted how both the current and former first ladies have made women's rights a signature issue. Since calling women's rights a human rights issue at a women's conference in Beijing in 1995, Clinton has made it a personal mission to champion the rights of women. Her first two trips as secretary of state have been packed with events promoting the importance of women's rights. ""These personal experiences have informed my work, and I will continue to fight for human rights as secretary of state in traditional and especially nontraditional ways and venues,"" Clinton told the audience. You ""can't solve problems of financial crisis, climate change, disease and poverty if half of the population is left behind,"" Clinton said. The rights of women will ""always be central to our foreign policy."" In a commentary published Monday in honor of International Women's Day, Clinton warned that ""women still comprise the majority of the world's poor, unfed and unschooled."" ""Global problems are too big and too complex to be solved without the full participation of women,"" she wrote in the article, which ran in more than 50 newspapers around the world. ""Strengthening women's rights is not only a continuing moral obligation -- it is also a necessity as we face a global economic crisis, the spread of terrorism and nuclear weapons, regional conflicts that threaten families and communities, and climate change and the dangers it presents to the world's health and security."" Ambiga Sreenevasan, a Malaysian lawyer who won an award Wednesday for her work on behalf of justice for women, called Clinton ""a woman of courage who has encouraged woman around the world."" Clinton's speech declaring that women's rights are human rights, Sreenevasan said, has ""resonated with a lot of us here."" Clinton also heaped praise on the current first lady, saying that in a very short time, Michelle Obama ""through her grace and her wisdom [has] become an inspiration to women and girls, not only in the United States, but around the world."" Obama spoke about the importance of proper health care, education and justice for women in ensuring strong families and communities. ""The difference between a broken community and a thriving one is the presence of women who are valued, where relationships among women and between women and men are based upon mutual respect,"" Obama said. Obama said the work done by the honorees has not just changed their own circumstances, but by inspiring hope and motivating others to act, that work also has changed women's lives around the world. ""This is how real change occurs, one determined woman at a time. And change is coming,"" she said. ""The women we honor today teach us three very important lessons. One, that as women, we must stand up for ourselves. The second, as women we must stand up for each other. And finally, as women we must stand up for justice for all."" On Wednesday, President Obama created a White House Council on Women and Girls, charged with devising a coordinated federal response to various challenges faced by American women. The council, which will be led by senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett and which will include most members of the president's Cabinet, will be charged with ensuring that all governmental agencies take the needs of women into account. The president said the council will also help ensure a more coordinated federal response on a range of issues, including equal pay, family leave and child care. He also nominated Melanne Verveer, Clinton's chief of staff when she was first lady, as ambassador-at-large for global women's issues. In addition to Sreenevasan, the Women of Courage honorees make up an impressive list of advocates on behalf of women under difficult and often dangerous circumstances. Hadizatou Mani escaped caste-based slavery in Niger to help fight for rights of other people still enslaved in the country. Veronika Marchenko was honored for her activism on behalf of slain soldiers' families in Russia. Suaad Allami won an award for running a nongovernmental organization on behalf of women in Sadr City, Iraq, that is considered a ""one-stop shop"" for legal, educational and domestic violence counseling for women. Mutabar Tadjibayeva is one of the most vocal activists in Uzbekistan fighting on behalf of women's rights, despite being arrested and beaten by police. In Guatemala, where an average of two women each day die a violent death, Norma Cruz provides support to families of women who are murdered. One honoree, 12-year-old Reem al-Numery of Yemen, was unable to attend because she is in court fighting her forced marriage to a 30-year-old cousin who allegedly raped and beat her. Her battle in the courts to divorce her husband has sparked an avalanche of activism on behalf of Yemeni preteens sold into wedlock.","First lady, secretary of state honor champions of women's rights .

"(CNN) -- The last remaining places for European football's showpiece tournament will be decided on Tuesday when eight nations compete in the second leg of the Euro 2012 playoffs. Ten countries have already qualified, along with co-hosts Poland and Ukraine, for the four-yearly tournament taking place in June and July. The most evenly-poised tie is in Lisbon, where 2004 hosts Portugal take on Bosnia-Herzegovina following Friday's 0-0 draw in Zenica. Turkey reached the semifinals in 2008, but face an uphill struggle to appear at the 14th staging of the event after Croatia won 3-0 in the first leg in Istanbul. Montenegro, competing for the first time as an independent nation, will also have to overhaul a deficit at home after losing 2-0 in Prague to the Czech Republic -- who finished runners-up on debut in 1996 after the split with Slovakia. Estonia caused a surprise by reaching the playoffs after taking second place in Group C behind Italy, meaning 2010 World Cup qualifiers Serbia and Slovenia missed out. However, the East Europeans are unlikely to be included in the December 2 group-stage draw after losing 4-0 in Tallinn to the Republic of Ireland on Friday. The Irish have qualified for the finals only once, in 1988. Next year will be the last time the tournament is played by 16 teams ahead of an expansion to 24.

"(CNN) -- Israeli President Shimon Peres said he had an amicable phone conversation with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a day after Erdogan stormed offstage during an angry exchange with Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan leaves the stage Thursday, as Israeli President Shimon Peres sits, left. Peres said he and Erdogan did not take the spat personally. ""I called him up and said, yes, it's nothing against you, nothing against Turkey. We consider you as a friend,"" Peres said. He said Erdogan reciprocated. Although there was no mention of an apology, Peres said there was a polite exchange between the two leaders. ""I didn't take it personally. I didn't go for a personal fight. I answered unfounded accusations. It was my duty. And they didn't change my mind,"" he said.  Watch Shimon Peres on the Gaza conflict Â» . Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation, has long been the Jewish state's closest military and economic partner in the region, and Turkey recently mediated indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria. But many Turks have been incensed with Israel over its three-week military operation that ended there earlier this month. And in Davos, Erdogan was angered after Peres said that Israel is committed to peace and blamed Hamas for the fighting in Gaza, where Israel staged a three-week military operation that ended earlier this month. When Erdogan began responding, a moderator cut him off, saying the debate had run over its allotted time. Erdogan patted the moderator on the arm until he was granted one more minute to respond.  Watch commentary on Erdogan's angry exchange Â» . ""I know the reason behind raising your voice is because of the guilty psychology,"" he said to Peres. ""My voice will not be that loud. You must know that. When it comes to killing -- you know killing very well. I know how you hit, kill children on the beaches."" He then left the stage, complaining that Peres was receiving preferential treatment. ""From now on, Davos is finished for me,"" Erdogan said. ""I will not come back. You won't let people talk. You gave him 25 minutes, but you gave me 12 minutes. This is not right."" Erdogan had described the military campaign against Hamas fighters in Gaza as ""barbaric"" and accused Israel of using excessive force. He said: ""The Palestinian Territories are like an open-air prison, isolated from the world. I have always been a leader who said anti-Semitism is a crime against humanity. But so is anti-Islamism."" Peres had said Hamas was responsible for the ""tragedy,"" accusing the Islamist militants of creating a ""dangerous dictatorship."" ""Israel left Gaza completely -- no occupation,"" Peres said. ""I want to understand why they throw rockets at us."" On Friday, after his outburst, Erdogan returned home to a hero's welcome. Thousands of people lined up at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, cheering and waving signs. A large banner read, ""You Will Never Walk Alone,"" and smaller signs bore phrases including ""Davos Conqueror."" People also were seen waving Turkish and Palestinian flags and throwing flowers on the road leading to Erdogan's home. Despite the glowing response at the airport, there has been some criticism in the Turkish media of Erdogan's exchange with the Israeli president. CNN Turk's Deniz Bayramoglu said the issue was still ""hot"" with Erdogan's secularist political opponents speaking out against the prime minister. ""They also say that Israel's behavior in Gaza is unacceptable but they are very critical of Prime Minister Erdogan's behavior,"" Bayramoglu said. ""Some are saying they are really proud of Prime Minister Erdogan and some are saying it is a diplomatic scandal."" Erdogan explained whom he was directing his anger at during a news conference at the airport. ""My words were only to the Israeli government, not the Israeli people,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Croatia sent out a message of intent to the other Euro 2008 finalists as they stunned highly-fancied Germany 2-1 in Klagenfurt to secure a place in the quarterfinals. Ivicia Olic celebrates Croatia's second goal in their superb 2-1 victory over Germany. Darijo Srna and Ivica Olic struck the goals as Croatia, who had only ever beaten Germany once before, produced arguably the first major upset of  the tournament. Lukas Podolski pulled a goal back late on for Germany with his third strike in two games to set up a nail-biting finale, but there was to be no way back for Joachim Loew's team, who finished with 10 men following the 90th-minute dismissal of substitute Bastian Schweinsteiger . Both sides came into the game having won their opening matches, although Germany had looked far more impressive in seeing off Poland than Croatia had in defeating Austria. However, it was Slaven Bilic's side who turned on the style at the Worthersee Stadion as they took control of Group B with two wins out of two. A frantic start to the match promised much but for all their huffing and puffing, neither side were able to create anything resembling a chance in the opening 20 minutes as defences held firm. The ball did find its way into the back of the net in the 22nd minute when Germany striker Mario Gomez slotted home past Stipe Pletikosa but the offside flag had already gone up against the Stuttgart man. The deadlock was broken for real just two minutes after that incident though, when Croatia went ahead through Srna. Danijel Pranjic sent over a superb cross from the left and Srna nipped in front of marker Marcell Jansen to slide the ball in at the far post, giving veteran Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann no chance. Croatia had a gilt-edged chance to make it 2-0 in the 30th minute, but Niko Kranjcar wasted it. Ivan Rakitic chipped a pass into the area which was flicked back towards the penalty spot by Olic, but the in-rushing Kranjcar was unable to cap a well-worked move as he blazed over. Germany knew they needed to step up through the gears and they finally made Pletikosa earn his keep with two efforts in rapid succession. The first saw Pletikosa push away a thunderous Michael Ballack free-kick, before the Spartak Moscow custodian awkwardly deflected away a Christoph Metzelder effort with his knee. Metzelder then headed a Torsten Frings corner just over from close range as the Germans stepped up their efforts for an equalizer before the break. However, Loew's side very nearly found themselves two goals behind in the 43rd minute, and they needed a fine reaction stop from Lehmann to deny Kranjcar, who chested down Olic's pass and smashed in a first-time volley. Having seen his side let off the hook, Loew opted for a more adventurous approach in the second half as he sacrificed full-back Jansen for jet-heeled winger David Odonkor during the interval. Aside from a Ballack shot over the crossbar though, Croatia looked fairly comfortable at the start of the period and also had a decent effort of their own with Luka Modric firing in a shot that Lehmann gathered, although not before seeing it squirm through his hands first. However, Lehmann's next task was to pick the ball out of the back of his net as Croatia stunned the Germans with a second goal in the 62nd minute. A Rakitic cross from the right took a deflection off Podolski before arrowing goalwards and although Lehmann, who had begun to come out for the initial cross, managed to dive backwards and get a hand on it, the ball struck his near post before rebounding back out to Olic, who had the easy task of slotting home. Germany looked for an immediate response but aside from a Schweinsteiger shot that fizzed across the face of goal, they were still finding it difficult to create chances against a well-organised Croatia backline. Loew's side earned themselves a lifeline with 12 minutes to go though when Podolski lashed home a shot on the half-volley after the ball had fallen kindly to him in the box. Germany could not build on that goal, though, and their final hopes of getting anything out of the match all but disappeared when Schweinsteiger was given a straight red card for shoving Jerko Leko in the final minute of an absorbing encounter. ""I want to especially congratulate my players, not only for the fight they showed but for playing an excellent match,"" said a delighted Bilic. ""There is no other way to beat the Germans than to play well. They're still a great team, though, and still one of the favorites for the title."" Ballack said the Germans had to recognize they must improve. ""Our movement was not fluid enough throughout the match and as a consequence we eked out few chances. ""We played below our level in all departments. Now we absolutely have to win our last match against Austria,"" said the Chelsea midfielder.","Croatia stun favorites Germany 2-1 in their Group B encounter in Klagenfurt .

"(CNN) -- They share a deep sorrow: an idealistic American who tried to protect the Kurds of Iraq, a Canadian general who refused to follow orders in Rwanda, a French priest who fought for the soul of Cambodia. CNN's Christiane Amanpour traveled to the killing fields of Europe, Africa and Asia for ""Scream Bloody Murder."" Each one tried to focus the world's attention on the world's most heinous crime: genocide. Each time, they were shunned, ignored or told it was someone else's problem. To understand why, CNN's Christiane Amanpour traveled to the killing fields of Europe, Africa and Asia for a two-hour documentary, ""Scream Bloody Murder."" Having reported on mass atrocities around the world, this time Amanpour traced the personal accounts of those who tried to stop the slaughter. The yearlong CNN investigation found that instead of using a U.N. treaty outlawing genocide as a springboard to action, political leaders have invoked reason after reason to make intervention seem unnecessary, pointless and even counter-productive.  Map: See the locations featured in the documentary Â» . December marks the 60th anniversary of the U.N.'s Genocide Convention, when -- in the aftermath of the Holocaust -- the nations of the world pledged to prevent and punish future attempts to eliminate ethnic, religious and national groups. Read the 1948 Genocide Convention (pdf) ""The Genocide Convention should have stopped genocide, but it didn't,"" said Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel. Intervention is a daunting challenge, he believes, because of a tendency to minimize accounts from refugees and victims. ""It's better not to believe, because if you believe, you don't sleep nights. And how can you eat? How can you drink a glass of wine when you know?""  See images from locations in the documentary Â» . 1970s: Cambodia . Father FranÃ§ois Ponchaud was a Catholic missionary in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge guerillas -- communist revolutionaries -- seized power in 1975. They expelled all foreigners from the country. But working from France, Ponchaud gathered refugee accounts and monitored radio broadcasts to document the slave labor, torture and executions the Khmer Rouge were using to kill one-fourth of Cambodia's population. He published his findings in a major French newspaper and wrote a book, ""Year Zero."" But even so, Ponchaud tells Amanpour, ""No one believed us.""  Watch a behind-the-scenes look at the making of 'Scream Bloody Murder' Â» . 1980s: Iraq . CNN found that intervention is often weighed against political and economic costs. Declassified U.S. government documents show that while Saddam Hussein was gassing Iraqi Kurds, the U.S. opposed punishing Iraq with a trade embargo because it was cultivating Iraq as an ally against Iran and as a market for U.S. farm exports. According to Peter Galbraith, then an idealistic Senate staffer determined to stop Hussein from committing genocide, the Reagan administration ""got carried away with their own propaganda. They began to believe that Saddam Hussein could be a reliable partner."" Read once-secret U.S. documents . 1990s: Bosnia . Even extensive news coverage may not lead to intervention. During the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the media reported on the Bosnian Serbs' ethnic cleansing of Muslims: the siege of Sarajevo, the concentration camps, the use of rape as a weapon of war. It was like watching ""a color remake of the black-and-white scenes we'd seen in World War II,"" said U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, whose Jewish grandfather fled Germany when Adolf Hitler came to power. Holbrooke was an early advocate for a U.S.-led military operation against the Bosnian Serbs. ""I took a stand that I believed was correct,"" he told Amanpour. ""I didn't think it was so controversial."" But it would take three years -- and the massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the town of Srebrenica -- for Holbrooke to make his case within the Clinton administration. 1994: Rwanda . In Rwanda, where Hutu soldiers and militias massacred their Tutsi countrymen, the Clinton administration tried to avoid characterizing the ethnic slaughter as genocide. According to an internal memo, the State Department worried that under the 1948 Genocide Convention, using the term ""genocide"" could force the U.S. ""to actually 'do something.'"" The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda, Canadian Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, begged for additional troops. Instead of reinforcements, Dallaire got an order to withdraw completely. He would not leave Rwanda. ""I refused a legal order,"" he told Amanpour, ""but it was immoral."" His tiny U.N. force was not enough to stop the slaughter of more than 800,000 people. 2003: Darfur . Some human rights advocates consider Darfur, the western region of Sudan, to be the scene of the first genocide of the 21st century. The atrocities in Darfur grow out of a civil war between rebels from Sudan's African tribes and the country's Arab-led government. In 2003, when the rebels attacked government outposts in Darfur, a U.N. human rights monitor warned that in the ""escalating conflict,"" Sudan's government may be ""engaged in ... ethnic cleansing aimed at eliminating African tribes from Darfur."" At the time, world attention was on Iraq, where the United States was fighting to overthrow Saddam Hussein. The early warning on Darfur ""disappeared into a big hole,"" according to Mukesh Kapila, then the U.N.'s top official in Sudan. Even when the U.N. Security Council put Darfur on its agenda, it took more than three years to authorize a robust peacekeeping force. ""There was no lack of information,"" says activist Eric Reeves. ""There was a lack of will to stop genocide."" In July, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court accused Sudan's president of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, charges Sudan denies. Read the ICC prosecutor's charges (pdf) How will history judge the world's response to Darfur? ""It will applaud the young people ... who believe in solidarity,"" says Wiesel. ""It will certainly criticize the leaders of the world."" And the next time somebody screams bloody murder to stop a genocide, will anyone listen?

"Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) -- Florida A&M University President James Ammons will stay in office during a hazing investigation, the school's board decided Monday. The A&M board of trustees rejected a request from Gov. Rick Scott to suspend Ammons while officials probe various issues at the school, including the suspected hazing death of a band member. ""We will stand firm against outside influences which hinder the viability of the university,"" said Solomon Badger, the board's chairman. ""It requires us to rely on facts,"" he said. The board chose not to vote on Ammons' status. Ammons was not present for Monday's meeting, but took part by telephone. On Friday, the medical examiner in Orange County, Florida, ruled that the death of 26-year-old Robert D. Champion was a homicide. The report said Champion was beaten to death during a hazing incident in Orlando on Nov. 19. No arrests have been made and the case remains under investigation, according to the Orange County Sheriff's office and the Orange County State Attorney's Office. Champion's parent talked about the autopsy report to CNN's Suzanne Malveaux on Monday. Robert and Pam described the anguish they felt after finding out exactly what killed their son. ""To see the autopsy and the part where they hit him all over his body,' Champion's father said. ""It's pretty painful to know my son had to go through something like that."" Champion's mother wants those involved to face criminal charges and be held accountable for their actions. But despite the tragedy of their son's death, the Champions aren't sure hazing will be considered a serious crime until tougher laws with strict penalties are put in place. ""We need laws that's going to make a person think of the actions,"" Champion's father said. The Board also decided to meet weekly for informational reasons during this process. Scott issued a statement saying, ""For the sake of appearances, and to assure the public that these investigations are clearly independent, I believe it would have been in the best interest of Florida A&M University for President Ammons to step aside until all of these investigations are completed. However, we have a process in Florida for the administration of the State University System, and that process has been followed."" Scott said he will abide by the decision. On Sunday, Scott said he was ""disappointed in the direction the dialogue regarding the hazing-murder of a Florida A&M University student has taken."" ""This week, I learned of reports of at least one child molestation case that took place on campus,"" Scott said, referring to a case unrelated to the hazing allegations. He added that Ammons told him he was not aware of the alleged incident until months after it occurred. School trustees already have reprimanded Ammons and placed band director Julian White on administrative leave. FAMU's National Alumni Association president said Sunday that Scott could place the school's accreditation in jeopardy by requesting Ammons' suspension. Tommy Mitchell said the president of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which oversees accreditation, warned Scott that school governing boards should be free of influence from government bodies. If the board suspends Ammons at Scott's direction, it could have unforeseen consequences for the university, he added. ""Gov. Scott should not be in the position of weakening the accreditation of our alma mater,"" Mitchell said. Ammons met with Scott on Friday. After the meeting, he said the two had a ""great conversation"" and that both ""have the interests of Florida A&M University at heart."" ""The governor made a recommendation, and as governor, he can make a recommendation,"" the university president said Friday. ""At the end of the day, it is up to the board of trustees. I will be right along with (their) decision."" Mitchell said the association's thoughts and prayers are with Champion's family. But he stressed that hazing is a national problem, and said deaths have occurred at other schools. Twelve to 13 deaths have occurred this year, he said, in Florida and other states, but did not provide specifics. ""Name another university that suspended a president for hazing -- and they have deaths every year,"" Mitchell said. ""... Hazing has occurred all over the country. Deaths have occurred all over the country."" He questioned why the situation at Florida A&M is receiving so much attention, adding it may be an ""HBCU (historically black college and university) problem."" In his statement Sunday, Scott said FAMU was not being singled out. He said he has called on all Florida universities to examine their hazing and harassment policies and requested that university presidents remind their students, faculty and staff ""of how detrimental hazing can be."" Controversy has swirled around the Tallahassee university since Champion's death, including three arrests tied to the alleged hazing of a freshman band member a few weeks earlier. And Jerry Bailey, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said last week that investigators looking into Champion's death have turned up evidence ""that there were financial irregularities having to do with the band and several other components of the university."" The suspected financial irregularities are not directly related to the death. Champion's parents told CNN that several students have reached out to them since their son's death, but they have not talked to anyone from FAMU about the investigation or what the is doing to prevent this tragedy from happening again. ""I want to see what kinds of things they're planning on putting into place. Obviously, what they had in place is not working,"" Champion's mother said. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Gov. Rick Scott says he will abide by the decision .

"Washington (CNN) -- As thousands of American service members prepare to depart Iraq as part of an agreement to leave by the end of this year, the U.S. State Department has issued a $10 million bounty for a man there it recently designated an international terrorist leader. Ibrahim ""Awwad Ibrahim"" Ali al-Badri, also known by the alias ""Abu Du'a,"" was put on the agency's global terrorist list earlier this week and is the senior leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, the State Department said. According to a State Department bulletin, Abu Du'a is in charge of overseeing all AQI operations, such as the August attack on Baghdad's Umm al-Qura mosque, and is based in Iraq. He has also threatened ""violent retaliation"" for the death of Osama bin Laden, who was killed in May after a decade-long manhunt ended with a U.S. raid on the former al Qaeda leader's compound in Pakistan. Three days after bin Laden's death, Abu Du'a claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 24 policemen and wounded 72 others, according to the bulletin. His group has also claimed responsibility for series of August attacks that began in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul and left more than 70 people dead. The terrorist designation is part of a U.S. effort to restrict resources available to Abu Du'a, while also freezing his assets in the United States, the State Department said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The defense anesthesiology expert in the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor was found in contempt of court Wednesday for referring to his private talks with Dr. Conrad Murray during his testimony. Dr. Murray did not testify in his own defense in his involuntary manslaughter trial and the judge refused to allow Dr. Paul White to base any of his testimony on anything other than what Murray told police. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor gave Dr. White 30 days to pay a $250 fine, but he also dropped a second contempt citation for derogatory comments he allegedly made about a rival witness. Wednesday's contempt hearing was part of the aftermath of Dr. Murray's involuntary manslaughter that ended with a guilty verdict last week. Another contempt hearing is set for November 29, the day Murray is set to be sentenced, for one of the defense lawyers who allegedly violated the judge's gag order by speaking to NBC's ""Today Show"" during the trial. Murray defense lawyer Michael Flanagan, who was in court to defend Dr. White Wednesday, said after the hearing that he believed Murray should be eligible for early release if he is given prison time. A California law that took effect last month provides for non-violent state inmates to be assigned to county jails to relieve state prison overcrowding. The Los Angeles County jail has a court-ordered early release program to relieve overcrowding, which allows non-violent offenders to serve much of their sentences at home with electronic monitoring. Flanagan said Murray is not a safety threat to the public and should be included in the early release program. Dr. White told reporters after the hearing that he still believed Jackson gave himself the overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol and a sedative the coroner ruled killed the pop icon. ""I was aware that Michael Jackson had self-administered drugs in the past, propofol specifically, and so what's to say that he wouldn't do it again,"" White said. ""He was desperate. Murray was withholding from him the drug that he desperately desired."" White, while under cross-examination by Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, referred several times to his private discussions with Dr. Murray about what happened the day Jackson died. Judge Pastor repeatedly warned him not to do so. Finally, the judge cited White for contempt and set Wednesday's hearing to decide if he would be fined. ""There wasn't any intentional deception here or violation of the court order,"" defense lawyer Michael Flanagan told Pastor Wednesday. ""He was explaining to Mr. Walgren 'Hey, I can't answer that.'"" Prosecutor Walgren, who has grown a beard since the televised trial ended, told the judge that this was one of ""multiple instances"" where Dr. White was ""trying to sabotage the trial."" ""It was intentional and deliberate,"" Walgren said. ""It was an attempt to deny the people a fair trial."" White told the judge he ""did my best as I was admonished by you to answer question truthfully and as completely as I could."" ""I apologize profusely if I disrespected you,"" White said. ""I learned a lot from this experience."" Pastor ruled that White was guilty of violating his order by giving ""a non-responsive answer"" that dealt with ""no-go territory."" While he could have fined him $1,000, he only imposed a $250 fine. Judge Pastor also dropped the other contempt charge which stemmed from an online report that quoted White allegedly calling prosecution anesthesiology expert Dr. Steven Shafer ""a scumbag.""","NEW: Defense lawyer: Dr. Murray should get early release if sentenced to prison .

"(CNN) -- Forget the 4G marketing hype. Which U.S. carriers really offer the fastest mobile-data networks? According to a new report from RootMetrics (a company which conducts its own field tests of wireless networks), Verizon Wireless currently offers the nation's fastest 4G -- by far. RootMetrics recently compared 4G networks from the four major U.S. carriers in 27 cities. Across all cities, Verizon performed at 4G speeds in 66% of tests. What qualifies as 4G speed? According to RootMetrics, that's a download speed of at least three megabits per second -- fast enough to download a 30-minute standard-definition TV episode in less than 10 minutes. ""In cities where we could test Verizon's LTE (network), their average download speeds were roughly equivalent with the other carriers' maximum download speeds. In several markets, Verizon's average download speeds actually exceeded the maximum speeds of the other carriers,"" the report said. What about the other carriers? According to the report, ""AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint offered similar performances to one another overall and jockeyed back and forth behind Verizon across the markets. AT&T and T-Mobile were especially close: AT&T offered 4G speed in 40.7% of our tests, while T-Mobile recorded 4G speed in 39.5% of our tests."" Of course, carriers do not deploy 4G networks evenly across a given metro area. They tend to focus deployment in more densely populated areas, and along major highways and office or shopping districts. Depending on the city and the carrier, they may also deploy more 4G resources in wealthier neighborhoods. So the report noted: ""In those cities where LTE was not available, Verizon performed markedly slower. Where LTE is present, Verizon is easily the fastest; where LTE is not, Verizon is among the slowest carriers for data delivery."" Most mobile users don't download huge files to their phones, so ""upper 3G"" download speeds (1.5-3 Mbps, according to RootMetrics) will still seem pretty impressive to a typical mobile user. And even ""lower 3G"" speeds (between 500 kilobytes/second and 1.5 Mbps) are adequate for most mobile activities. On this front, AT&T's HSPA+ network is pretty dependable, said RootMetrics: . ""AT&T delivered 3G speeds more consistently than the other carriers: they recorded upper 3G speed in 28% of our tests and lower 3G speed in 20% of our tests. AT&T fell below 3G speeds in only 11% of our tests, the lowest percentage of any of the carriers."" T-Mobile's performance was mostly similar to AT&T's in terms of 4G, but ""disparities emerge when comparing T-Mobile's non-4G tests to AT&T's. When T-Mobile didn't hit 4G, they ... were more prone to slipping to slower 3G speeds."" Sprint may offer more consumer-friendly 4G data plans than AT&T or Verizon -- but there's a performance tradeoff. RootMetrics found ""a significant disparity between cities where Sprint had WiMAX available and those where WiMAX was either not present or access to it proved sporadic. For instance, Sprint delivered a market-best average download speed of 4.6 Mbps in WiMAX-enabled Kansas City, while recording a noticeably slow 0.5 Mbps in non-WiMAX Buffalo."" If you like to post or live-stream audio or video from your phone to the Internet, you probably care about upload speeds -- which means you might want to avoid Sprint, unless it offers a WiMAX network in your city. ""Sprint's average upload speeds were consistently slow. Sprint was the only carrier to never record an average upload speed above 1.0 Mbps in any of the markets we tested,"" said the report. Sprint also markets cell phone service through several discount carriers that focus on no-contract mobile plans, such as Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile -- and some of these brands are starting to market 4G phones and service. Julia Dey, vice president of marketing for RootMetrics, clarified that the company's numbers for Sprint would apply to other carriers that rely on Sprint's networks. If you're unsure, you can ask the discount carriers whether they use Sprint's network in your city -- and whether it's a WiMAX network or not. MetroPCS (which never rolled out much of a 3G network) has been aggressively deploying its own 4G LTE network. The current RootMetrics 4G comparison report does not include MetroPCS, but Dey says RootMetrics is starting to add MetroPCS and other carriers to its field testing regimen. The company plans to start publishing city reports with data from these carriers by the end of this year. In addition to rating carriers' 4G performance across all of the cities, the report rated cities according to how much choice local residents have in 4G carriers. When rating cities for 4G access and quality, RootMetrics took more than speed into account: By their reckoning, a ""4G city"" must also offer a choice of reliable 4G providers. In all, 19 of the 27 cities RootMetrics examined had at least three (and sometimes four) carriers offering download speeds of at least 3 Mbps in more than 40% of their field tests. Denver and Portland, Oregon, topped this list, achieving 4G speeds in over 61% of tests. The remaining eight 4G cities had at least two carriers meeting this benchmark. Philadelphia and Chicago were at the bottom of this category, each reaching 4G speeds in about 42% of field tests. If you're trying to find the best cell phone network where you live, don't just rely on carrier coverage maps or speed claims -- which are often based on theoretical maximum output from cell towers. RootMetrics offers coverage maps based on data gathered via its own field testing team, plus crowdsource data gathered via its iPhone and Android apps. In the last year it has also published mobile performance reports for about three dozen major U.S. metro areas. OpenSignalMaps, another source to check, offers similar crowdsourced data gathered via its Android app. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Verizon performed at 4G speeds in 66% of tests -- better than AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile .

"Ibb, Yemen (CNN) -- When 18-year-old Amal al-Sadah became the fifth wife of 43-year-old Osama bin Laden in 2000, she was ""a quiet, polite, easygoing and confident teenager"" who came from a big, conservative family in Yemen, a relative told CNN in an exclusive interview. The relative, Ahmed, who knew al-Sadah growing up, said she came from a traditional family in Ibb, Yemen -- established and respectable but certainly with no militant views paralleling the al Qaeda leader's terrorism. The family had no connection to al Qaeda prior to the arranged marriage, Ahmed told CNN during an interview in Ibb on Friday. While some accounts say a matchmaker put the couple together, the relative wasn't sure of that report, adding he heard many stories about how the two were betrothed. ""She was a very good overall person,"" Ahmed told CNN. ""The Sadah family is a big family in Ibb. The family of Amal was like most Yemeni families. They were conservative but also lived a modern life when compared to other families. ""The family is a respected family and is well known. The family had no extremist views, even though they came from a conservative background,"" Ahmed said, referring to al-Sadah's parents and siblings. The Yemeni government is apparently pressuring the family not to speak publicly about their notorious in-law, bin Laden, Ahmed said. ""From what I know, the government would give the Sadah family an extremely difficult time and always warns them from talking to the media,"" Ahmed said. ""The government tells them that the information or comments they give would be misunderstood or misinterpreted and could hurt the family more than the government."" An al Qaeda figure in Yemen named Sheikh Rashed Mohammed Saeed Ismail said he arranged the marriageand told the Yemen Post in 2008 that he was ""the matchmaker"" and that al-Sadah was one of his students, describing her as ""religious and pious enough."" Ismail, whose brother spent time as a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, accompanied the young bride-to-be to Afghanistan in July 2000, where she and bin Laden were married after he gave her family a $5,000 dowry. The marriage was apparently a political alliance to shore up bin Laden's support in the land of his ancestors. ""I was told after they got married that Osama did not want to cut his ties with his ancestral home, Yemen,"" Ahmed said. Back in Yemen, al-Sadah was barely spoken of again, Ahmed told CNN. ""After her marriage, we heard a little about her, and her direct family knew the dangers of talking about such topics,"" Ahmed said. ""Even if anyone asked them about her, they would avoid talking about the issue."" At first, Yemeni authorities didn't seem aware that they were giving al-Sadah a passport in 2000 for the purpose of marrying bin Laden in Afghanistan, Ahmed said. ""Only a small number of people knew about the story of the marriage in the start, so it wasn't difficult to travel,"" Ahmed said. ""The Yemeni government gave the family a hard time after she left Yemen. The family is still being watched and have been interrogated dozens of times. Her father also went through a lot."" The marriage was immediately fruitful, and al-Sadah and bin Laden gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Safiyah, in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in the weeks after 9/11. According to Pakistani officials this week, Safiyah was inside the Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound where bin Laden was killed Monday by U.S. Navy SEALs, and she probably saw her father shot dead. Ahmed asserted that al-Sadah and bin Laden also bore other children, but he couldn't provide details in his brief interview with CNN. In ""The Osama bin Laden I Know"", Peter Bergen spoke with Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir, who met bin Laden soon after the 9/11 attacks. Mir said bin Laden had told him that he had plans for his youngest daughter, Safiyah. ""I became a father of a girl after September 11,"" he said. ""I named her after Safiyah who killed a Jewish spy at the time of the Prophet. (My daughter) will kill enemies of Islam like Safiyah."" In the aftermath of bin Laden's death, al-Sadah has told interrogators that for five years, she didn't venture outside the walled compound, according to a Pakistani military spokesman. Al-Sadah, now 29, who was wounded in the raid, said she lived in the compound in Abbottabad with eight of bin Laden's children and five others from another family, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN this week. All of them have been in Pakistani custody since the pre-dawn U.S. commando raid Monday that killed bin Laden, and they will eventually be returned to their country of origin, Abbas said. With five wives, bin Laden had a total of 20 children, and one of his adult sons was also reported killed in the commando assault. Al-Sadah is the youngest of the five wives. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Osama bin Laden was 43 when he married an 18-year-old Yemen woman in 2000 .

"(CNN) -- The death of Steve Jobs has renewed comparisons to another great innovator who died 80 years ago this month -- Thomas Edison. But there are important differences between the two men. In the 80 years between their deaths, consumers came to dominate the economy, a transformation that was only beginning during the later years of Edison's life. Steve Jobs was a master at understanding how to create transformative consumer technologies. Although Edison was a key innovator in two consumer technologies -- sound recording and motion pictures -- he struggled to understand the consumer markets he helped to create. His most important technological innovation was the electrical system, which made possible the personal computers, music players and smartphones innovated by Jobs. Edison was also more involved in the day-to-day work of invention than Jobs, and his other great innovation was the industrial research and development laboratory . While the differences between Edison and Jobs are important, so, are their similarities. These offer lessons for other innovators. Jobs and Edison succeeded because they were good at envisioning how long-term developments in scientific and technical knowledge could be transformed into new technologies. At the start of his electric light research Edison described his vision for an entire electric light and power system and then used the knowledge of decades of research on incandescent lamps and generators to create the first viable incandescent lamp and the entire electric light and power system that made it commercially viable. Similarly, before developing the Macintosh computer, Jobs envisioned how two decades of work on graphical user interfaces and the computer mouse could transform the way people used computers, and also how the development of touchscreens and miniaturization could be transformed into the smartphone. In developing new technologies, both men focused on the long-term. They understood that innovation does not happen overnight and were willing to commit considerable resources to a process that might result in failure. In fact, both had notable commercial failures. With Jobs it was the NeXT computer, and with Edison it was a method for processing low-grade iron ore. Neither was a technical failure, however, and they became successful elements in subsequent innovations. The software that drove the NeXT computer became an important part of the Macintosh operating system, while Edison's rock-crushing technology was widely licensed. Edison himself used this technology to enter the Portland cement industry, where he became a major producer by innovating a long rotary kiln that became the industry standard. As part of their long-term vision of innovation, both Jobs and Edison understood that a device that worked well experimentally might not be suited to everyday use. They therefore spent time and resources to ensure their technology was commercially viable before putting it on the market. Jobs publicly demonstrated the first IPhone six months before it was ready for the market. After his first public demonstration of a lamp and lighting system, Edison spent a year on further development before he introduced them commercially. And, after commercial introduction, both innovators continued to fund research to improve their products and keep them at the forefront of the market. Nonetheless, both Edison and Jobs were better at introducing transformative technologies than dominating the markets they created. Finally, Edison and Jobs were masters at using the media to promote both their products and themselves in ways that captured the public imagination. Such promotion, however, was based on a solid foundation of innovation that helped to transform people's lives. It is for this reason that President Herbert Hoover asked Americans to dim their lights for a minute to honor Edison's memory. It's also the reason that on news of Jobs' death, fans flocked to Apple stores and held vigils -- lit by iPhones. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Israel.","Paul Israel says some have compared Steve Jobs impact to that of Thomas Edison .
He says there are differences: Edison not in tune with consumer markets but Jobs was .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man suspected in the death of an elderly woman who was set on fire in the elevator of her Brooklyn apartment building over the weekend was arraigned Monday on charges of murder and arson. Jerome Isaac, 47, is being held without bail, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, and is scheduled to appear in court again on Friday. He wore a white jumpsuit and did not speak during the arraignment. The left side of his face appeared to be badly burned. Isaac's attorney requested his client receive medical attention and be placed in protective custody because of the ""publicity and the nature of the offense."" Isaac is accused of attacking 73-year-old Deloris Gillespie. He told police Gillespie owed him $2,000 for work he claims he did for her, said NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. He turned himself in to police overnight Saturday or early Sunday morning. Neighbors said the woman was returning home to her fifth-floor apartment in Prospect Heights after a grocery store trip Saturday. A preliminary investigation showed Isaac standing outside the elevator on the fifth floor and attacked the woman as she was attempting to exit, authorities said. The incident was caught on surveillance cameras inside and outside the elevator, and police have the videotapes, Browne said. Authorities believe Isaac initially sprayed the woman with a flammable liquid, presumably gasoline, and continued to spray her as he followed her back into the elevator, Browne said. The woman was first sprayed in the face, he said. Then, using ""one of those long lighters that you would use for a grill, he lit a Molotov cocktail and used the burning leg on top of that to ignite her body,"" Browne said. The suspect stepped out of the elevator, threw the Molotov cocktail inside, then returned again to spray more liquid on the woman as she burned, he said. ""This is as bad as it gets,"" Browne told CNN's Don Lemon. Authorities responding to a 911 call of a fire found the woman's body inside the elevator. She was pronounced dead at the scene, according to police. Isaac lived about 10 minutes away from Gillespie's apartment building, Brown said. After the incident, he apparently returned home and ignited the door to his own apartment, he said. He was concerned he had burned himself in the second incident, although no one else was injured, Browne said. He then hid out on a rooftop for a while and fell asleep, later going into a police station ""reeking of gasoline"" and telling officers he was responsible for a fire. During questioning, Browne said, he implicated himself in Gillespie's death. CNN's Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","47-year-old Jerome Isaac is being held without bail .

"(CNN) -- Genetic screening techniques that allow parents to choose their children's gender are now more accurate than ever and are becoming increasingly mainstream, but experts are divided over whether the technology should be used in this way. A technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) was originally developed two decades ago to allow embryos to be tested for genetic disease. It requires parents to use in vitro fertilization, where eggs are fertilized outside the womb. With PGD, the embryos are tested for genetic disorders and only those that are free of disease are transferred to the mother's uterus. It means that parents who carry genetic defects can ensure they don't pass on a genetic illness to their children. But PGD also can also be used to allow people undergoing in-vitro fertilization to select the gender of the embryo implanted in the mother's uterus. Click on the flags above to watch people around the world answer the question, ""Would you choose your child's gender?"" Using PGD for gender selection is banned in most countries, but it is legal in the U.S., where the procedure costs around $18,000, including in-vitro fertilization. Los Angeles fertility expert Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg uses PGD for gender selection. He told CNN's Vital Signs program that many of his American clients already have children of one gender and are trying to achieve ""family balancing."" He added that 70 percent of his patients are from countries where the procedure is banned. Critics question the ethics of gender selection, and some argue that it could lead to a gender imbalance, particularly in societies with a traditional preference for boys. ""If anything, there's a slight preponderance for females, and this is contrary to everything that is publicized, and clearly it varies by country,"" said Steinberg. ""China is strongly in favor of boys, as we would suspect. India, strongly in favor of boys. But when you look at the world in general, it's 50-50"" Dr. Mark Hughes, who pioneered PGD, he has concerns about its use for non-medical purposes. He told CNN, ""It definitely is an expanded reproductive choice. The question is, is it medicine? Is it something that doctors should be involved in?"" But Steinberg argues that it's wrong to limit scientific capabilities. ""I say to critics that the last thing in the world that you want to do is put the handcuffs on science. ""We've been giving women expanded reproductive choices for 50 years. This is another choice."" Although the technology for gender selection is becoming more widespread, it remains controversial. Some feel that it's ""playing God,"" while others welcome having more choice in family planning. Would you choose your child's gender? Sound Off below.","Technology that lets parents choose their children's gender is becoming more mainstream .

"(CNN) -- For video game fans, many of the gadgets and accessories designed to support today's games are as unique and imaginative as the games themselves. From inflatable Wii racing karts to iPad joysticks and plastic assault rifles tailor-made for living room juntas, there's no shortage of weird, wild and occasionally even useful peripherals for handheld and set-top systems alike. Among the hundreds of available gaming gizmos and add-ons are a  coffin-shaped guitar instrument case and  blinged-out chrome plating for consoles. They're great to look at, but they won't enhance your gameplay much. Here are five recent accessories designed to improve your gaming experience: . G155 ($299.99, http://www.projectgaems.com/) -- A portable game room to go, this carrying case unpacks to reveal a built-in 15.5-inch LED HD screen, stereo speakers and dual 3.5mm headphone jacks that let you annihilate friends or save the universe anywhere you travel. Pop an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 Slim in, hook up the HDMI cable, and assuming you don't mind a little heavy lifting, voila. You can spend family vacations with your head happily buried in ""WWE All Stars"" or ""Killzone 3."" Arcade FightStick Tournament Edition ($159.99, www.madcatz.com) -- Pricey, but infinitely cheaper than springing for an arcade machine, this PS3 and Xbox 360 joystick controller and eight-button pad delivers authentic coin-operated control and precision. Designed for use with popular fighting games such as ""Marvel vs. Capcom 3,"" it lets you plug in its 13-foot USB connector cable to enjoy customizable button mappings, turbo functionality and that classic quarter-munching feel. Charge Base for 3DS ($29.99, www.nyko.com) -- Given the Nintendo 3DS handheld 3-D gaming system's anemic 3- to 4- hour battery life, this useful combo charging dock and capacity-boosting rechargeable battery comes in especially handy by offering double the juice. It's not the most convenient accessory to carry around. But if you're planning on marathon play sessions, it can keep you happily splattering aliens or downing submarines twice as long as usual. PlayStation Move SharpShooter ($39.99) -- This plastic attachment lets you turn your PlayStation Move motion controller into a full-fledged rifle, theoretically providing greater accuracy and atmosphere in shooter games like the suddenly timely ""SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs.""

"(CNN) -- Alan Kardec scored a spectacular second-half winner for Brazil against Costa Rica to set up a replay of the 1993 Under-20 World Cup final against Ghana in Egypt. Costa Rica midfielder David Guzman, left, battles for the ball with Brazil captain Giuliano. Four-time champions Brazil edged a 1-0 victory against underdogs Los Ticos in Cairo after the Black Satellites qualified for the final for the third time with a 3-2 victory against suspension-hit Hungary in the first semi. Striker Kardec's 67th-minute goal, his fourth of the tournament, lit up an otherwise uninspiring match as he crashed home a superb volley from a tight angle after substitute Bertucci's left-wing cross bounced to the far post. Costa Rica had lost their opening game of the tournament to Brazil by a morale-sapping 5-0, but bounced back to reach the last four, beating hosts Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in the previous rounds. The Central Americans came closest to scoring in the first half as David Guzman's 25-yard free-kick forced a fine save from Brazil goalkeeper Rafael. However, the South Americans' dominance of possession -- they had an incredible 70 percent of the play -- finally told, with players lining up to take potshots at Costa Rica's goal. But Los Ticos held on bravely, and even sent goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado to the other end of the pitch for three late corners, but the lack of quality in crucial areas was telling. Ghana will be seeking to win the tournament for the first time on Friday, having lost to Brazil in the 1993 final and to Argentina in 2001. The Africans looked lethal in attack against a Hungary side missing three key players following the dramatic 3-2 victory over Italy in the quarterfinals, but suffered from defensive lapses. Dominic Adiyiah netted twice to give Ghana a 2-0 halftime lead before Marco Futacs pulled one back, but Abeiku Quansah crashed a spectacular late goal to make it 3-1 and substitute Adam Balajti set up a tense finish. Striker Adiyiah netted the opener from close range in the ninth minute after Andre Ayew pounced on Adam Presinger's poor back-pass and rounded goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi. He then scored a tournament-leading eighth goal in the 31st minute with a powerful header from Samuel Inkoom's cross. Balazs Megyeri hit the post for Hungary in the second half before fellow substitute Marko Futacs reduced the deficit in the 73rd minute after a pass into the penalty area from Andras Simon. Roland Varga and Janos Szabo both squandered golden chances to level, the latter from a simple header, and Ghana made the most of their escapes when Quansah crashed in a shot off the underside of the crossbar in the 81st minute. David Addy's lapse allowed Balajti to comfortably sidefoot home just three minutes later, but it was Ghana who looked most likely to score again as Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu smashed a fierce long-range shot against the bar in time added on.","Brazil beat Costa Rica 1-0 to reach final of the Under-20 World Cup in Egypt .

"(CNN) -- The world produces enough food to meet the needs of its population, yet nearly one in six people suffers from chronic hunger according to the United Nations' Committee on World Food Security. There are ways to change this statistic. Here are five creative ways to make an impact on hunger in your community and around the globe. Create . The Empty Bowls Project, the brainchild of artists John Hartom and Lisa Blackburn, uses ceramic arts to fight hunger. At each event potters and other artisans donate handcrafted bowls. Guests select one of the bowls and are served a meal of soup and bread. They take home their bowl as a reminder of how many go empty around the world. Money raised is donated to organizations fighting hunger locally, like soup kitchens and food banks, or globally, like Oxfam and Feed the Children. Empty Bowls started as a classroom project, but the movement has spread across the United States and to at least 14 other countries. Events vary between locations because they are independently organized, but all share the Empty Bowls name and mission. To find an Empty Bowls event near your or learn how to host your own, visit the website. Dine . What if fighting world hunger were as easy as eating lunch? That's the goal of the One World Everybody Eats Foundation (OWEE). The foundation began with a single cafe in Salt Lake City where the menu has no prices. Customers who can afford it are asked to pay a little extra for their meals to help those who can't. Those in need can volunteer and earn a meal or enjoy the ""community dish"" free of charge. Dishes are prepared fresh daily and use many local, organic ingredients. ""I think we have to rethink how we feed people in their time of need,"" says OWEE founder Denise Cerreta. ""What sets this apart from other restaurants is that truly anyone can walk through the door and afford to eat here, and it's good, organic, wholesome food."" Through the foundation, Cerreta now mentors a network of these cafes around the country. For more information about the foundation and a list of current locations visit the website. Tweet . The #AfricaNeedsYou project is harnessing the power of the Twitterverse to help famine victims in East Africa, asking dozens of celebrities who get paid to tweet about products to donate their endorsement money to UNICEF. All twitter users can log on to send a prewritten tweet to one of these celebrities encouraging them to get involved. ""Usually, it's the celebrities who have influence over the crowd; we're trying to shift the balance of power and give the crowd influence over the celebrities,"" says co-founder Paul Calway in a statement announcing the project. To learn more about UNICEF's work in East Africa or to make a personal donation go online. Build . You don't have to work for a nonprofit or NGO to fight hunger with your professional skills. Canstruction is proof. Canstruction hosts design competitions for architects, engineers, contractors and students where teams construct fantastic sculptures out of canned foods. At the end of the competitions, the cans are donated to local food banks. The organization says it raised more than 2 million pounds of food last year at 103 competitions around the world. If you're not a designer or architect, don't worry. You can still participate by attending one of the competitions and voting for your favorite design. Cost of admission varies but is often a can of food. For more information and a list of upcoming Canstruction competitions, go to the organization's website. Learn . Test your knowledge and feed the world by playing Freerice, a free online trivia game benefiting the World Food Programme (WFP). Players pick subjects ranging from literature to chemistry, and for every correct answer ten grains of rice are donated through WFP to end hunger. Sponsor ads on the site fund rice donations. WFP estimates it takes 9,700 grains of rice to feed one person one meal. Players donated over 13 billion grains last year, totaling over 1.3 million meals. Since June, all rice earned through the game supports WFP's school meal programs in Cambodia. Rice is purchased in country, supporting the Cambodian economy. The game is available in English, Spanish, Italian and French. A Chinese version is coming soon.","Nearly one in six people suffers from chronic hunger, according to the U.N.

"(CNN) -- The Oka boys are a true band of brothers. All seven served in the military, yet they fought on opposing sides. ""We were seven brothers -- seven soldiers,"" says 91-year old Chikara ""Don"" Oka, a World War II veteran now living in a retirement home in Los Angeles. ""Five of us for the United States and two against us because they were stranded in Japan"" when the war came. They're all American citizens born here in the United States. In the 1920s, Oka's parents operated a migrant labor hotel in Castroville, a farm town in central California. But their dreams of riches never materialized, and the entire family returned to Japan. In 1937, three of the older brothers -- Isao, Masao and Don -- returned to the United States in search of a better life. They worked in the wholesale produce business, and Don enrolled at Otis Parsons Art Institute in Los Angeles, hoping to be a fine artist. Then on December 7, 1941 the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the brothers' dreams were put on hold. They received draft notices, and while many of their fellow Nisei -- second-generation Japanese-Americans -- were being booted out of the Army, classified as enemy aliens, the brothers found their niches. ""All of us served -- three of us at first for MIS (the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service, as Japanese language specialists), and two younger ones (Teiji and Takeo) for the Japanese navy and army. The youngest ones were stuck in Japan but too young to serve. After the war, Terumasa (Ted) and Hidekazu (Dan) came back as United States citizens, and when the Korean War started, they volunteered also with the MIS."" ""Don"" Oka's memories of war are still vivid. Clutching a crumbling photo album, he peels back pages filled with fading photographs and hand-drawn cartoons of his Army life. The stories spill out like the loose pages in his album. Perhaps Oka's most vivid memory is also his most poignant. On Christmas Eve, 1944, he remembers running for cover while his younger brother Takeo -- a pilot -- dive-bombed an American camp on Tinian Island in the Marianas. ""I remember the attack"", Oka says, ""because I was on Tinian, and here comes a plane. I look up in the sky, it was at night, and I saw those planes in a searchlight and they were shooting. I could hear the bullets coming down, and we rushed out."" As Takeo Oka returned to his base in Japan, he was shot down. The wreckage and his body were found on an island near Iwo Jima . ""I knew he must have been serving because he was at the age, but I didn't know until it was all over and I came back and found out he died"" Don Oka says. ""I was just hit so hard that I didn't feel right."" Oka picks up two photos from his tattered album. In one photo, Takeo is seated, wearing his Japanese Imperial Navy uniform and gripping a samurai sword. The other is a photo of Takeo's grave marker in the family's village, Okayama near Hiroshima. ""What a waste,"" Oka says. ""I wish he [Takeo] were alive."" By 1945, Japan was losing its grip in the Pacific. Takeo's younger brother, Teiji, was conscripted into the Japanese army. He was on a troop ship sailing with hundreds of recruits toward Okinawa as reinforcements. The ship was attacked and sunk by American planes. Teiji Oka was wounded and died several years later. Isao Oka, the oldest brother, was to ship out with the celebrated 442nd Japanese American Regimental Combat Team to Europe. Two days before, he heard the question, ""Who speaks Japanese?"" He answered simply, ""I do!"" and was also transferred into the MIS. Isao Oka served in the Philippines and became known as the ""voice of American propaganda."" Using shortwave radio, he broadcast Japanese music and read news and commentaries whose goal was to demoralize Japanese soldiers throughout the Pacific islands and urge the citizens of Japan to surrender. On July 27, 1945, a day after it was released, he broadcast the Potsdam Declaration -- the terms of Japan's World War II surrender. ""I don't know how the reception was, but I was really happy the war was over"" he says. Masao, the second-oldest brother and last of them drafted, saw occupation duty in two of Japan's major cities, Kobe and Osaka. For Don Oka, the third-oldest brother, service wasn't always so metropolitan. On Tinian Island, he said, ""I saw bodies everywhere"" after a nine-day Marine battle there in 1944. Eight thousand Japanese were killed. By comparison, the 2nd and 4th Marine divisions lost 328 men. Hundreds of Japanese troops held out in the jungles for months. Around the camp's perimeter, he saw starving Japanese soldiers scavenging for food. He'd yell, in Japanese: ""War is over around here! Many Japanese have surrendered and are in camps under our care. Please come out and surrender!"" ""Maybe my Japanese was bad ... they didn't come out, "" Oka says. The following summer, the B-29 bomber Enola Gay flew from Tinian airfield to drop the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima. As part of his duties on Tinian, Oka was asked to start a school for hundreds of Japanese and Korean children. With the war in the Pacific over, Oka helped Marines in occupied Japan. They scoured the countryside for the wreckage of downed American bombers and their missing servicemen. They never found survivors. Oka was with the first U.S. Marine unit to meet Japanese civilians in the Shimonoseki region on the Japanese island of Kyushu. ""I was a little frightened,"" he says of his initial contact with the Japanese civilians -- worried about perceptions that he, a Japanese-American, was consorting with the enemy. To his relief, he discovered that his shared heritage and translation skills, coupled with a respectful Marine presence, calmed everyone's fears. The war in the Pacific ripped apart nations and families, and it divided loyalties. But Don Oka is pleased with all of his brothers' achievements. ""I'm kind of proud,"" he says of their military service. ""But at the same time, I really hate war from the beginning."" He adds: ""Those brothers of mine didn't hate me. I didn't hate them. We were brothers. We were just called to do the job, and we did it.""","All seven Oka brothers served in the military: some for the U.S. and some for Japan .

"(CNN) -- Marco Simoncelli's local track is to renamed in his honor following the Italian MotoGP star's death in Malaysia last month. The 24-year-old was born in Cattolica on the Adriatic Riviera, less than five miles from the Misano World Circuit, which will now bear his name. The board of directors of the circuit voted unanimously for the change following the tragic accident at the Sepang International circuit on October 23 which claimed Simoncelli's life. ""We owe it to the memory of Sic (Simoncelli's nickname),"" Lucas Colaiacovo, the circuit's vice president was quoted on its official website. ""We owe it to his family, to the hundreds of thousands of fans who admired his courage and humanity, all of the individuals in the sporting world and media who support this spontaneous and moving proposal. ""We are pleased and proud to associate the Misano circuit with Marco Simoncelli, a champion in sport and in life."" The circuit added that it would not use Simoncelli's name for any commercial activities. Meanwhile, the MotoGP series has moved to the Spanish port city of Valencia for the first race since Simoncelli's fatal accident. His San Carlo Honda Gresini team are taking part in the final round of the world championship in his honor, but it was newly-crowned champion Casey Stoner on his Repsol Honda who set the fastest lap in first practice Friday. Suzuki's Alvaro Bautista led a wet second session with a time of one minute 47.975 secs, two seconds slower than Stoner's earlier benchmark.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The recent convictions of Pakistan cricketers Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir brings to an end this sad chapter on corruption, however, the full story will continue as names of other players were also mentioned during the trial; they will be investigated and further action may also be taken. Butt, Asif and Amir sold themselves for a relatively modest amount of money and in the process destroyed their careers and brought cricket and Pakistan into disrepute. The fact that three players, possibly more, were involved is worrying; none of them considered that what they were doing was not only wrong but also dishonest and illegal. In Pakistan, where cricket provides a welcome distraction from the internal security threats and the terrible natural disasters the country has faced in recent years, there is a sense of outrage and anger at being let down by people who were role models for hundred of thousands of fans. I believe that the convictions for the players were correct. In addition to the jail sentences and fines they have all been banned for five years from any form of cricket. I do feel sorry for teenager Amir; while I am not convinced that he was coerced or pressurized, he was naive and in all probability did not fully appreciate what he was doing or its consequences due to his background and education. Butt and Asif must never again play for Pakistan; I would treat Amir's case with more sympathy but it will be very difficult for him to get back into international cricket in five years time. I am not happy with the sentence given to agent Mazhar Majeed; it should have been much tougher. For me the important question is how did this happen; what lessons did we learn and what should the game do going forward? It was very clear that the three players did not understand the ethos of the game or what the spirit of cricket means. They also callously ignored the ICC Code of Conduct on corruption and matching fixing. The ICC has an excellent program for awareness and prevention of corruption; so where did the message fail to get through? The ICC works in partnership with every cricket board to educate the players on corruption. In this case it is clear that the Pakistan Cricket Board did not do enough. This was a major failing and the PCB should not only accept responsibility for this but undertake to ensure that it does not happen again. The team management had concerns about the players' agent but failed to do anything about it. There had been rumors about the team's performance in Australia before the tour to England, yet no measures were taken to tighten the controls around the players and stop outside influences from having access to them. When the News of the World broke the story, the PCB went into denial implying this was a conspiracy against the Pakistan team; this forced the ICC to take action against the players something the PCB should itself have done. After the match fixing scandals in the late 1990s the PCB worked very hard to eradicate corruption from the game. Certainly, until 2006 when my term as President of the ICC came to an end, I was confident that the PCB and specifically its chairmen during my time, made great efforts to prevent and monitor corrupt practices in Pakistan cricket. But things have gone dreadfully wrong in the past three to four years and Pakistan cricket has paid the price of a weak governance structure. The chairman is appointed by the president of the country without a consultation process with any of the key stakeholders in the game. The PCB chairman is not accountable to anyone; some years ago the PCB chairman also assumed the position of chief executive and downgraded the role of the CEO to chief operating officer; this destroyed whatever little checks and balances existed within the PCB. Without a sound governance structure and professional management, corruption will remain a huge risk for Pakistan cricket. I do not believe that corruption is endemic in cricket; almost all of the Test playing countries have a robust anti-corruption regime. During my time with the ICC I met with Paul Condon, the then chairman of the ICC Anti-Corruption Unit, for one to one briefings on corruption. He was confident that match fixing was not taking place but was not so confident about 'spot fixing' where one or more players could be corrupted; this was difficult if not impossible to monitor. These incidents can be avoided by the national cricket boards having a robust education program for the players; appointing mentors from within the team to help and guide new players and having an effective anti-corruption units to monitor domestic as well as international cricket. Most of the boards already do this; unfortunately the PCB's anti-corruption program was not effective. The education program for the players should start when they first start playing domestic first class cricket. For its part, the ICC must engage with the governments of countries such as India, UAE and Pakistan where a very large unregulated betting industry exits. The epicenter of cricket betting is India; hundreds of millions of dollars are bet on each match, particularly when India is playing. The ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit is not able to access the betting odds being offered or monitor suspicious bets being placed. Unless betting is regulated in these countries it will remain very difficult to stop players being approached. I would also like to see the ICC have the powers to carry out an annual review of the anti-corruption processes of every Test playing country; testing the players and relevant officials through annual on-line questionnaires to assess how well they understand the ICC Code of Conduct on corruption. Where players get low scores the ICC should have the authority to require the player's board to take remedial action and re-training of the board's officials in-charge of educating the players. In case of extreme failure on the part of a board to demonstrate that it has a robust anti-corruption program, the country should be suspended from international cricket until the ICC Board is satisfied that the particular country has put a robust anti-corruption regime in place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ehsan Mani.","The convictions of three Pakistani cricketers is not the end of the story .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Syrian-born naturalized American was ordered held in custody Wednesday after he was charged for allegedly spying on Syrian protesters in the United States. Judge Theresa Buchanan at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ordered Mohamad Anas Heitham Soueid, 47, held until Friday, when there will be a detention hearing. Prosecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick told the judge that Soueid was a flight risk. Soueid, of Leesburg, Virginia, was charged October 5 with conspiring to collect video and audio recordings and other information about people ""in the United States and Syria who were protesting the government of Syria and to provide these materials to Syrian intelligence agencies in order to silence, intimidate and potentially harm the protestors,"" the Justice Department said Wednesday. The Syrian Embassy in Washington responded Wednesday by denying the allegations, saying Soueid never worked for the Syrian government to spy on protesters. Soueid was arrested Tuesday after a federal grand jury charged him in a six-count indictment. He is charged with conspiring to act and acting as an agent of the Syrian government in the United States without notifying the attorney general as required by law; two counts of providing false statements on a firearms purchase form; and two counts of providing false statements to federal law enforcement, the Justice Department said. This comes amid Syria's seven-month-long crackdown against protesters. ""Today's indictment alleges that the defendant acted as an unregistered agent of the Syrian government as part of an effort to collect information on people in this country protesting the Syrian government crackdown. I applaud the many agents, analysts and prosecutors who helped bring about today's case,"" said Lisa Monaco, assistant attorney general for national security. The indictment says Soueid has been an agent of the Syrian Mukhabarat, a reference to Syrian intelligence agencies. ""At no time while acting as an agent of the government of Syria in this country did Soueid provide prior notification to the Attorney General as required by law, the indictment alleges,"" the Justice Department said. ""Under the direction and control of Syrian officials, Soueid is accused of recruiting individuals living in the United States to collect information on and make audio and video recordings of protests against the Syrian regime -- including recordings of conversations with individual protesters -- in the United States and Syria. He is also charged with providing the recordings and other information to individuals working for the Mukhabarat. According to the indictment, Soueid and others conspired to use this information to undermine, silence, intimidate and potentially harm those in the United States and Syria who engaged in the protests."" In late June, the Syrian government paid for Soueid to travel to Syria. He met with intelligence officials and privately spoke with President Bashar al-Assad, the indictment said. ""In addition to the recordings, Soueid is accused of providing the Mukhabarat contact information, including phone numbers and e-mail addresses, for protesters in the United States. In a handwritten letter sent to UCC-1 (an unindicted co-conspirator), Soueid allegedly expressed his belief that violence against protesters -- including raiding their homes -- was justified and that any method should be used to deal with the protesters. The indictment also alleges that Soueid provided information regarding U.S. protesters against the Syrian regime to an individual who worked at the Syrian Embassy in Washington, D.C."" In a statement, the Syrian Embassy challenged the Justice Department to provide evidence of the allegations. It said Soueid is not an agent of any Syrian institution and has never worked for any Syrian official. The allegation that any U.S. citizen is working with Syria to intimidate other U.S. citizens is ""absolutely baseless and totally unacceptable,"" the embassy said. Syria never paid Soueid for travel or any other expense, the embassy said. It also denied there had ever been a private meeting between Soueid and al-Assad, calling it a ""ludicrous"" accusation. It also said the embassy had never recruited anyone to inform on any activities in the United States. ""Contrary to the statement of the Department of Justice, Mr. Soueid has never provided any individual at the Syrian Embassy in the U.S. with any information regarding U.S. protesters or otherwise,"" it said. ""This is a flagrant effort to defame the Embassy of Syria based on sheer lies and fabrications."" The indictment also said FBI agents interviewed Soueid and he is accused of lying ""when he denied that he had collected information on U.S. persons and transmitted that information to the government of Syria."" ""In addition, Soueid allegedly made further false statements when he denied to FBI agents that he had directed someone to audio or videotape a conversation, meeting, rally or protest, or that he was aware of any individual taking photographs or videotaping people. He also allegedly made false statements when he denied that he had ever been an agent of the Syrian government or a foreign intelligence officer."" ""The ability to assemble and protest is a cherished right in the United States, and it's troubling that a U.S. citizen from Leesburg is accused of working with the Syrian government to identify and intimidate those who exercise that right,"" said Neil MacBride, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. ""Spying for another country is a serious threat to our national security, especially when it threatens the ability of U.S. citizens to engage in political speech within our own borders."" If Soueid is convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison. Soueid is also known as Anas Alswaid, the Justice Department said. Alswaid had been named in a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Syrian citizens or Syrian-Americans who say they have been subjected to abuse or are family members of those who have been abused by the defendants. Along with Alswaid, the defendants include the Syrian Arab Republic, the Ministry of State Security Intelligence, al-Assad's brother Maher, the Syrian ambassador to the U.S., Imad Moustapha, and others. The suit was filed in May. ""Alswaid is an integral part of the criminal conspiracy to torture, maim, and kill Syrians. Through his efforts, the al-Assad regime learns the identities of Syrians based in the United States, who are trying to assist in the efforts to counteract the tactics of the al-Assad regime. He transmits such information to Damascus to initiate criminal conduct against the families of the identified Syrians,"" the suit alleges.

"(CNN) -- Unlike many of Thailand's flood-ravaged zones in the central plains, Bangkok residents have been given the rare luxury of time -- a window of at least two days to prepare for what officials warn could be the worst flooding the city has seen in decades. Scenes vary dramatically in the city, with life carrying on as usual for many while others scramble to protect their possessions from the expected deluge that will hit as waters from the flooded central plains rush in. Gallery: Bracing for Bangkok floods . Outside homes, businesses and schools in low-lying areas of Bangkok that the government has warned are at risk of being worst hit, people can be seen erecting flood walls out of sandbags to safeguard against the incoming waters. Others are simply moving valuables to higher ground. For some residents, it's too late. Rising water levels on the Chao Phraya River and city canals have left many restaurants, shops and homes flooded, while public piers are covered in makeshift walkways and sandbags to keep ferry passengers dry. ""Our homes have been flooded for two weeks,"" says Khun Lek, 76, who lives in Bangkok's riverside Wat Tewarat community near Sanghee Bridge. ""Every year it's like this. The government comes to check on things and tries to help by building elevated paths for us. But we don't need much help ... we're used to this. Not like the people in Ayutthaya. If the floods move in, all we can do is move out to the road."" At Bangkok's Boon Chuay Muay Thai gym, fighter Jaroensak Sorwapin says they've been dealing with flood waters for a month. ""We can't fight as the water is bad for the skin on our feet, while jogging is impossible in the neighborhood, so we have to travel to another part of the city. The gym is losing money too as we used to get foreign boxers coming to train, but they've stopped coming."" At city supermarkets, many Bangkokians have been stocking up on water and food over the last few days as a precaution should flooded streets block access to shops, though the city's governor has told media there's no need to panic. ""Discount stores crowded with people stockpiling dried food and water in the face of unprecedented floods threatening to rage,"" said Twitter user KimEkkanant. The governor's suggestion is difficult for many to follow given the thousands of images Bangkok residents are seeing in the media of their fellow Thais suffering in nearby provinces like the former ancient capital Ayutthaya, where residents have had their livelihoods destroyed by the floods. Yet it is these images of hardship that are prompting some Bangkokians to join forces to help those affected by the floods in other parts of the country, with many using Facebook and Twitter to organize supply drives, fundraising events and spread news on how people can help. ""In two hours time our community raised enough money for 69 boats! Only 31 until we reach our target of 100!"" tweeted Bangkok's NIST International School. As was the case with the 2010 protests and eventual government crackdown, social media is indeed playing a key role in spreading information on the latest Thailand flood news. Many Twitter users are simply choosing to vent their frustration at the uncertainty, wondering if and when their homes will be hit. Others are sharing personal photos of flooded neighborhoods and rising water levels. Overall though, little has changed in the city as it waits for the expected floods to hit. In many parts of Bangkok, where the floods are expected to have a minimal impact, life is continuing as normal as people go about their daily lives. The government has dismissed calls to declare a state of emergency and issue a special holiday decree for Bangkok, so businesses and government offices remain open and public transportation is running. Major events are also going on as planned, including Tuesday afternoon's World Cup qualifier match between Thailand and Saudi Arabia at Bangkok's Ratchamangala Stadium. In terms of preparation, government workers have reportedly been told by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra they have two days to build three major flood barricades before runoff from the north reaches Bangkok. Monsoon rains and unusually high ocean tides are expected to worsen the situation between October 13-17 and October 26-31, impacting the flow of water from the Chao Phraya River into the Gulf of Thailand. Bangkok has set up a 24-hour flood relief operation center at Don Mueang Airport and prepared nearly 200 shelters to handle possible evacuations.

"University Park, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Tens of thousands packed Penn State's football stadium Saturday, cheering the Nittany Lions for the first time since graphic child sexual abuse allegations rocked the university and led to the ouster of its president and iconic football coach. The Nittany Lions lost the game -- the first in 46 years without Joe Paterno as head coach -- 17-14 to Nebraska. But the man who replaced Paterno said that the actions of fans and players Saturday sent a message against sexual abuse and helped them personally come to grips after an emotional week. ""It was a day of solidarity for the children, for the victims -- it was a touching moment,"" interim coach Tom Bradley said of the crowd's demeanor and emotional pre-game ceremonies focused on child abuse. ""I felt that today, just maybe, the healing process started to begin."" A moment of silence was held before the game in honor of the alleged victims. Current and former players from Penn State and Nebraska locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. Interim Penn State President Rodney Erickson said Saturday that it was important for the Penn State community, led by the team's players, to ""show unity"" for one another and in opposition to child sex abuse. Doing so, he said, is particularly important in the wake of the flood of emotions, including on-campus rioting, that followed Paterno's firing. ""We ... want to demonstrate not just to the Penn State community, but to the rest of the world, that Penn State is a caring community, that Penn State is moving forward with a sense of purpose, and that hopefully there are elements of good that can come out of this situation,"" Erickson told reporters after the game. Sports Illustrated: Despite defeat, healing process begins . Paterno's son Jay Paterno, a current Penn State assistant coach, told ESPN on Saturday that ""the world ... turned upside down"" exactly one week earlier with the arrest of former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. A 23-page grand jury report described crimes that Sandusky allegedly committed against young boys between 1994 and 2009 -- some of them on campus, both during and after his tenure at at Penn State. Sandusky's attorney, Joseph Amendola, has said that his client disputes the report. In addition to Sandusky, Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz were charged for failing to report the abuse to authorities and misleading authorities. Joe Paterno, the winningest coach in top-level college football history, was not criminally charged. Still, he was dismissed Wednesday by Penn State's board of trustees for failing to do more when a then-graduate assistant told him in 2002 that he had seen Sandusky allegedly rape a boy in the showers of a campus athletics facility. Paterno alerted Curley, his immediate boss, but it was years before law enforcement first learned about the allegation. The graduate assistant, Mike McQueary, who was later promoted to a full-time assistant coach, eventually described the alleged incident in graphic detail to a grand jury. McQueary was placed on administrative leave Friday. Scores of people gathered outside Paterno's home early Saturday evening to show their support. The former coach wasn't home during the game -- later pulling up in a minivan -- but his wife, Sue, did come out briefly to thank those who ""propped me up"" after the turbulent week. Jay Paterno said Saturday that he had a simple message for his father before the Nittany Lions took to the field Saturday. ""Dad, I wish you were here (and) we love you,"" the younger Paterno recalled to ESPN, breaking into tears. Many questions remain unanswered in the case, with several investigations launched by the school and the state to probe further possible wrongdoing by team, athletic department and administrative officials. Whatever those investigations find, Erickson has said it is imperative to promote dialogue about sexual abuse and change the ""culture"" at Penn State so that witnesses don't hesitate to come forward. ""Never again should anyone at Penn State -- regardless of their position -- feel scared to do the right thing,"" Erickson said earlier this week following his appointment as interim president after trustees on Wednesday ousted Graham Spanier. Spanier initially voiced support for Curley and Schultz following the release of the grand jury report Saturday. CNN's Sarah Hoye contributed to this report.","NEW: The interim coach says ""today, just maybe, the healing process started to begin""

"(CNN) -- A fledgling force of Syrian military deserters said it struck an important government security complex on the outskirts of the capital overnight, a bold strike reflecting the resolve and confidence of the regime's opposition. The assault came ahead of an Arab League meeting Wednesday to reaffirm a decision to suspend Syria's membership, a move the group made over the weekend after President Bashar al-Assad's government failed to abide by a proposal to end a brutal crackdown on protesters. Also Wednesday, France recalled its ambassador to Syria, the French Foreign Ministry said. The move followed attacks on French missions in Syria. The defector group, called the Free Syrian Army, said it attacked an air intelligence base in Harasta and planted ""powerful explosions inside and around the compound that shook its foundations."" Andrew Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said air intelligence has been deeply involved in the eight-month-long crackdown by the Syrian government against protesters, a grinding civil conflict that the United Nations says has left more than 3,500 people dead. Tabler said the strike reflects the growing sophistication of the Free Syrian Army, which has brigades across the country and has been in existence since the summer. ""It opens up a new era of the conflict,"" he said, adding that the development represents ""a bad direction"" for the country. ""Until now, most of the protests have been peaceful."" The Free Syrian Army said it ""carried out special operations in various areas in Damascus in order to spoil the plan that the regime is preparing against our people and our homeland."" The regime should ""take note"" that the deserter force ""is capable of striking them in any place and at any time we want,"" the group said. Activists said the deserter army used rocket-propelled grenades and the intelligence complex was damaged. Activists also reported damage at the complex in Harasta, an eastern suburb of the capital, Damascus. Free Syrian Army Lt. Abdullah al Odah, speaking to CNN in Istanbul, Turkey, called the late-night operation brief. He said 20 defectors armed with rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles participated and that it involved people from inside as well as outside the security branch. He didn't know whether security forces suffered casualties but he said no rebels were hurt. He called air intelligence ""one of the most terrifying secret service departments in Syria"" and said such security entities will be targeted by defectors. ""This branch is responsible for many of the crimes against Syrian people and political prisoners,"" al Odah said. ""We will announce the whole story to the world in the correct time."" It was one of five actions reported by the opposition force, which has recently emerged as an important factor in the opposition movement as more and more soldiers have left the Syrian army. The opposition force also reported clashes with personnel loyal to al-Assad in several areas. They include Qaboun and Arbeen, Damascus neighborhoods, and Saqba, a suburb. There was also fierce fighting in Douma, a city in the Syrian countryside. ""A clash between the Free Syrian Army and Assad's criminal gangs and his mobsters (the shabiha) in Douma, our Free Syrian military caused the Assad's gangs a lesson that they will never forget and heavy losses at the roundabout in the Douma municipality,"" the army said. The shabiha are pro-government militias. Tabler said the Free Syrian Army consists of soldiers who've left their posts instead of obeying orders to fire on protesters. They've also had active operations in and around Homs, Idlib and other areas recently, he said. Opposition groups like the Free Syrian Army have been calling on the international community to help protect protesters. They have urged the United Nations to impose a no-fly zone, as it did in the Libyan conflict, and a naval blockade. Army leaders have said such policies could allow them to establish a base of operations to launch a campaign to bring down al-Assad's regime. The group surfaced when seven military officers, believed to be original members of the Free Syrian Army, announced their defection in a video posted on YouTube in July. The group's leaders, who had been exiled to Turkey, say they're directing a guerrilla war effort against the al-Assad regime, which acknowledges an increasing number of deadly attacks on its soldiers, including a bombing of a Syrian army tank near Daraa recently. Col. Riad al-Assad, a 30-year veteran of the Syrian air force, claims to lead a force in Syrian cities of some 10,000 mainly low-ranking soldiers, a number impossible to verify. But the opposition fighters are believed to have little firepower -- planting bombs and carrying out hit and run attacks -- and they're a small force in comparison with Syria's military, which numbers in the hundreds of thousands. The group has a Facebook page, which calls on other soldiers to join it. The Arab League, meeting in Rabat, Morocco, said al-Assad didn't stick by his pledge to release detainees, withdraw armed elements from populated areas, and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and Arab League monitors. The league has also called for unspecified sanctions against Syria and called on member states to withdraw their ambassadors from Damascus, a decision that will be up to each nation. The Syrian Arab News Agency, a state-run outlet, quoted a government source as saying that ""Syria decided not to participate"" in Rabat, where there was a ministerial meeting of the Arab League council and an Arab-Turkish cooperation meeting. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the Arab-Turkish group that the Arab League's move to suspend Syria's membership was ""a responsible and well-timed step that put forth the gravity of the situation."" He said Syria hadn't fulfilled commitments to the league and the Turks to rein in the instability. A former ally of Syria, Turkey has threatened to cut off power supplies if Syria does not change course. Turkey's Energy Ministry said it has suspended negotiations with Syria over joint oil exploration. ""The Syrian administration should read the message of the Arab League correctly, and by ending the violence it is inflicting on its people open up the way for the inevitable process of democratic transformation. It is not possible for any administration to win a struggle against its own people. It is not possible for an administration based on collective punishment and everyday killing people on the streets to be successful,"" Davutoglu said. ""The Syrian administration must know that public opinion in neither the Arab world nor the world at large can bear these heart-wrenching images forever. Time is working against the Syrian regime. All of the credit and the helping hands that have been extended to the Syrian regime to date have been wasted,"" he added. The final communique Tuesday from the Arab-Turkish forum ""emphasized the necessity of halting the bloodshed and violence against Syrian citizens, and the importance of taking urgent measures to assure the safety of civilians. The ministers stressed the importance of the stability and unity of Syria and the need for the resolution of the crisis without any foreign intervention."" The Arab ministers also ""expressed their appreciation to Turkey for providing temporary protection on its territories for Syrian citizens who fled to Turkey."" Mohammed al-Ikhsafi, Morocco's ambassador to Syria, told CNN a demonstration occurred in front of his country's embassy in Damascus on Wednesday. ""There was some improper behavior in front of the embassy. The protesters threw tomatoes and rocks at the embassy and they brought down the Moroccan flag and raised the Syrian flag instead,"" al-Ikhsafi said. ""I asked them to send in a delegation so I can listen to their demands and what they were protesting against. I explained to them Morocco's stance in the Arab League and then they left. The demonstration is over now. No one was physically attacked or injured."" Morocco's Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks on its embassy, the country's official news agency reported. The United Arab Emirates denounced an attack on its embassy. A Western diplomat in Damascus told CNN in an e-mail that windows were broken there. ""The Syrian government will shoulder the responsibility on maintaining the security of its diplomatic mission and the respect and safety of its staff,"" said foreign affairs undersecretary Juma al-Junaibi. ""It is clear that there was negligence on the part of the Syrian government in providing the necessary measures to ensure the protection of the UAE diplomatic mission in Damascus, and the protection of its staff."" On Saturday, pro-government protesters attacked Arab and Turkish entities in Damascus, Aleppo and Latakia. The Turks have demanded compensation for damage to their buildings and they have evacuated families of diplomats and some nonessential personnel. On Monday, Syria's state news agency reported that Syria's foreign minister publicly apologized for the embassy attacks. And Jordan's King Abdullah said this week that a person in al-Assad's position would step down, a statement observers interpreted as a call for the Syrian president to do just that. For its part, the Syrian government freed 1,180 detainees Tuesday as part of the Arab League peace plan. But opposition groups said the gesture was too little, too late. The death toll keeps mounting, they said, with at least 81 killed in clashes Monday -- making it one of the deadliest days of the uprising. The number of civilians killed Wednesday was 20 -- 11 in Homs, 7 in Idlib, and 1 in each Daraa and Damascus suburbs -- said the Local Coordination Committee of Syria, a coalition of activists. CNN is not able to independently verify claims of fighting and casualties because the Syrian government has restricted international media access to the country.","Free Syrian Army says it knows of no casualties in assault on government complex .

"New York (CNN) -- Thousands of Occupy Wall Street demonstrators deluged New York on Thursday, a show of strength in the movement's original home that was echoed nationwide as part of a ""mass day of action."" Scores were arrested in New York, and several police officers were reported injured, as protesters fanned out across the city moved toward Foley Square in Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. By early Thursday evening, many had crossed the bridge -- the same place where more than 700 had been arrested last month -- chanting, ""This is what democracy looks like -- This is what America looks like,"" according to the New York movement's official Twitter feed. This time, they marched in the pedestrian walkway, not blocking the roadway. Nearby, pro-Occupy slogans were projected onto one side of the Verizon Building. Those in New York were not alone. Like-minded activists also took to the streets in all corners of the nation -- from Miami to Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon, to Boston -- marking two months since the activist effort aimed at the nation's wealthiest 1% began in Manhattan. Roundup of protests across the country . ""I think the numbers have increased dramatically today,"" said New York protester Jo Robin. ""Particularly after the raid, our message is being broadcast all over the world."" The group twice squared off against riot police in Zuccotti Park, where they'd been evicted two days earlier. They'd also engaged in several confrontations with police, leading to scores of arrests. That includes 64 protesters -- wearing T-shirts with the figure ""99%"" prominently featured -- arrested at an early evening sit-in on Centre Street near Foley Square in lower Manhattan, a police spokesman said. (Earlier, police spokesmen and protest organizers had said -- incorrectly -- that 99 people were arrested in this same incident.) In total, police said around 8 p.m. that a total of 245 people had been arrested around the city. During a late afternoon press conference, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that at least seven police officers were hurt Thursday during exchanges with protesters. Five of those officers were injured when a unidentified liquid was thrown on their faces, Kelly said, adding that the officers experienced a burning sensation and required hospitalization. And a 24-year-old police officer was injured when a star-shaped glass object was thrown at him, Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters during a visit to Bellevue Hospital Center where the officer was being treated. It is not clear how many demonstrators have been injured during the clashes. Overheard on CNN.com: Some tire of Occupy protesters . CNN and CNN affiliate New York One broadcast images of the exchanges, including video of one man -- whose face appeared to be covered in blood -- sitting near police who wielded shields and batons. Authorities constructed barricades at Zuccotti Park, in front of the New York Stock Exchange and along Fifth Avenue in an apparent attempt to keep demonstrators off the roads and on pedestrian walkways. Residents and workers near the New York Stock Exchange were required to flash identification cards as police cordoned off the area amid concerns that demonstrators would try to disrupt trading. Earlier in the day, protesters lifted metal barricades that ringed Zuccotti Park, a former home-base for the movement, defying authorities and blocking traffic. Bloomberg said the day's protests had ""caused minimal disruptions to our city,"" he asserted that some demonstrators had ""deliberately pursued violence."" In Lower Manhattan, CNN iReporter Alvaro Perez shot video showing protesters being pulled away by police, including one woman who appeared to be dragged by her jacket and backpack. ""I don't want to speculate on what happened in advance of that,"" police spokesman Paul Browne said of the incident. He said the ""big picture"" of how police have handled demonstrations has so far been mostly positive. ""People were able to get to work"" and ""protesters were able to protest,"" Browne added. Occupy roundup: Movement marks 2 months . Earlier, on CNN's ""American Morning,"" Howard Wolfson, a New York City deputy mayor, vowed, ""We'll make sure, if people want to peacefully protest, they have the right to."" But, he added, ""if people break the law, we'll have to deal with that."" ""If they attempt to enter a building they're not allowed in, that's breaking the law. If they want to express their concerns about Wall Street, that's totally fine,"" he said. While the city has come under fire from protesters and other critics for arrests and removing protesters from Zuccotti Park, Wolfson insisted that ""we had to act"" to stop illegal activity, such as drug use, and to eliminate fire hazards. ""This is a place where we honor the First Amendment,"" he added. Still, the ouster from Zuccotti Park did not appear to stifle the New York protest effort. The group tried to sum up its intent on a Twitter post: ""Enough of this economy that exploits and divides us. It's time we put an end to Wall Street's reign of terror and begin building an economy that works for all."" The Occupy movement, likewise, showed few signs of abating elsewhere in the United States. In cities such as St. Louis, Milwaukee and elsewhere, thousands responded to the ""day of action"" plea. And as in New York, some of those ended up behind bars after refusing to heed law enforcement officers' calls to move. The next highest arrest figure was in Los Angeles, where 25 people were arrested early Thursday and another 25 were arrested later in the day, Officer Andrew Neiman said. Bail was set at $5,000 for those detained, he added. In Portland, police reported 48 people arrested in three separate incidents. That includes 25 taken into custody on the east end of the Steel Bridge, nine inside a Wells Fargo bank and 14 in and around a Chase Bank. In the latter incident on Thursday evening, Sgt. Pete Simpson said that police used pepper spray to get individuals to move off a street and from the path of a commuter rail line. Another 21 were issued citations for blocking Las Vegas Boulevard in that Nevada city, Las Vegas police officer Bill Cassell told CNN, while Atlanta police arrested eight for blocking a roadway. There were also arrests in other places, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. And in Denver, District Attorney Mitchell Morrissey announced Thursday that three men now face felony charges -- including inciting a riot and assaulting a police officer -- for their alleged actions while clashing with authorities during Occupy Denver protests.

"(CNN) -- It would be hard to claim surprise at the array of sanctions which were finally imposed on the Syrian regime in the last weeks, following months of seemingly endless warnings from friends and foes alike. Yet, judging by the reaction of various officials in Damascus, the regime does seem stunned by this shock to its system, having been living in denial about the evolving situation it created. From the apex of its fortunes only a couple of years ago to the most severe isolation modern Syria has ever witnessed, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad regime has single-handedly managed the feat which no other detractor achieved: bringing the entire country, and of course the regime itself, to a dead-end from which it can no longer extricate itself. While accustomed to U.S. sanctions since 1979, Syria had never been simultaneously cut off from Europe, Turkey and the Arab world, while also facing the most determined popular uprising the Arab world has yet seen. For refusing to stop its mass military campaign of repression throughout the country, which none of the neighbors or friendly nations could continue to ignore while urging for the proverbial promised reforms, the Syrian regime is now faced with a heavy bill it has no way of paying. Taken separately, the various sets of sanctions could have been manageable, even if the hardships would still be passed on to the population under the usual empty slogans of sovereignty and resistance in the face of a global conspiracy. In response to the first set of EU sanctions, in fact, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem had told a press gathering that Syria would ""forget that Europe was on the map"" and turn eastward for its business. When the sanctions reached the oil sector, the Syrian regime boasted it would sell its crude to China, India and other ""non-aligned"" countries. However, with the increasing difficulties of dealing with a Central Bank under sanctions, even countries sympathetic to the Syrian regime have been unwilling to go through so much trouble just to acquire Syrian oil, which, to boot, is mostly a low-grade crude needing special refineries. With Europe wiped off the map, the 150,000 barrels per day output which used to be exported across the Mediterranean will be difficult to sell, with very significant financial repercussions for the regime - and that was before the Arab League finally decided to tighten the screws. It is possible that repeated warnings followed by recurring extensions of deadlines convinced the Syrian regime that Arab countries were bluffing, and that the legendary impotence of the Arab League would prevent real pressure from materializing; this could explain al-Assad's bloody intransigence, and his erroneous interpretation that he really still had a carte blanche to kill, literally, the growing popular uprising which was now supplemented by armed resistance from an increasing number of defected soldiers, grouping themselves to form the Free Syrian Army. When the announcement of sanctions finally fell on November 12, even with additional deadlines allowing the regime to accept a set of conditions (including Arab monitors) which could save it from isolation, al-Assad and his advisers seemed unprepared. Instead of astutely accepting the offer to avoid greater seclusion, they decided to retreat into the usual conspiracy rhetoric while trying to buy time with complaints about protocols: this merely allowed the Arab League to ensure near unanimity in its decision to isolate al-Assad. All that remained was for Turkey to close the loop, and to carry out its own promise to punish the Syrian regime if it did not desist in what the UN has since described as crimes against humanity. As of this week, the Syrian regime is completely isolated, politically and financially. Even the reluctance of Lebanon and Iraq to apply full sanctions will be unlikely to make a big difference in Syria's fortunes, especially as international pressure continues to mount. The impact of this isolation cannot be exaggerated. While powerful allies such as Iran and Russia will try, for the time being, to pull their weight as they attempt to save the regime from its own folly, perhaps lending it limited financial support, a solid geographical reality imposes itself, cutting off Syria from most of the rest of the world. There is no doubt that these measures will also hurt those who imposed them, and this is one of the reasons why they were so long in coming. For Turkey, not only has the zero problem with neighbors policy been shattered, but the Arab world opening it had carefully nurtured will be negatively affected if transport trucks must now take a long diversion through Iraq. This will take time, effort and resources which had not been expected. The truth is that for all the propaganda spewed by the Syrian regime, few countries in the region want to see Syria completely isolated, if only for their own selfish reasons. Everyone is worried about potential civil strife and its effect on the region, but there is also an economic aspect: while losing trade with Syria might not make a difference to most neighbors, losing the trade route will. The battered Syrian population will only feel more hardship as it struggles to overcome this unprecedented period in recent history, and the sanctions will affect people, economically, socially and politically. Indeed, even Syrians who do not actively support the revolution will feel the pain of remaining silent while the al-Assad regime entrenches itself with increasing violence, if that were possible. Decades ago, the regime had been able to count on the population's fear and on its acceptance of the broad argument of resistance in the face of imperialist aggression. Today, however, the imposed agony of sanctions coupled with the extreme brutality of the regime will probably push people to make a stand before it's too late. The sooner this happens, the less likely the possibility of civil strife or of intervention in Syria. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rime Allaf .","Syrian officials appear shocked by sanctions, despite endless warnings .
The ban on oil sales will have significant financial repercussions .

"(CNN) -- Volcanologists in the Philippines are closely monitoring a volcano on Luzon Island close to the capital, Manila, after a sudden spike in seismic activity. Twenty one volcanic earthquakes were recorded at Taal Volcano from Sunday 8 a.m. to Monday 8 a.m. One of the earthquakes was felt by local residents in Brgy Calauit at the southeast side of the island. Scientists at the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) say the quakes are an indication that magma is moving towards Taal's surface. The main crater lake has been heating up since January. PHIVOLCS Science Research Specialist Alex Ramos told CNN that scientists have seen ""a slight intensification of steaming in the main crater lake."" He said emissions of carbon dioxide have risen from 1,875 tons per day in February to 4,670 tons at the end of March. PHIVOLCS has raised its five step alert level to 2 around Taal and is warning people not to go near the crater lake or main Daang Kastila Trail due to the high concentration of toxic gases and a risk of steam explosions. The popular tourist attraction is 65 kilometres (40 miles) south of the Manila. An estimated 7,000 people live on the volcanic island which last erupted in 1977.

"(CNN) -- It was just after midday on a cold December Monday in South Korea's capital when news of Kim Jong Il's death filtered through. Though the reclusive North Korean leader had been plagued with health problems in recent years, the announcement was greeted with general astonishment in Seoul, according to a journalist from the country's largest newspaper. ""The initial reaction was shock, quickly followed by speculation about what was going to happen next,"" said Woosuk Ken Choi, assistant editor with The Chosun Daily. For its part, the South Korean military responded by raising its alert level, while the country's media went into overdrive trying to predict how this oblique and erratic state would respond. But Choi said most ordinary Koreans were remaining calm. North Korea: Should we fear change? ""There was no rush to supermarkets to buy up food,"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""The South Korean public seems confident that the country will be able to manage this. Many see the North Koreans as like us, people we need to care for and help."" Outright conflict is not something many would expect, he added. ""There is a little tradition in Korea that when someone passes away in a family you stop fighting. ""We're on high alert not because we want to do something but because some renegade North Korean unit might cause some trouble. But no one really thinks the North Koreans will launch an attack. ""Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time."" The architect of what became known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948 after the Korean peninsula was divided between U.S. and Soviet occupation forces, Kim Il Sung was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of Juche, or self-reliance, which did much to foster the Communist country's isolation. When Kim Jong Il, his oldest son, succeeded him, North Korea was crippled economically, having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed. Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy, U.S.-backed south. What military hardware does North Korea have? But with Kim dead, Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor, perhaps even paving the way for reunification. ""Most people, whether left or right on the political spectrum, hope this is the case,"" he said. ""However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification, citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s. ""Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run. I also believe a whole host of issues could be resolved with reunification."" But Choi said each generation in South Korea has its own viewpoint when it comes to relations with the north. ""Those in their teens and 20s have a real fear of military conflict, as they are the ones who have to complete their compulsory military service,"" he said. ""Many people in their 30s and 40s worry about the financial cost to them of reunification, while those in their 50s and 60s back a united Korea whatever the cost."" If reunification is a pipe dream for now, Choi says there is a difference of opinion in South Korea about the dynastic succession in the north. ""Many people believe the transfer of power to a third generation is absurd, totally anachronistic and not what the world is about today,"" he said. ""But those who believe in a policy of engagement with North Korea say it doesn't matter whether it is third or fourth generation, they're still our people and we need to talk to them to try and resolve the situation."" Another view, according to Choi, is ""the Great Successor"" will not last long. ""He's simply too young,"" he said. Kim Jong Un is believed to be in his late 20s. ""There is this notion in Korean society -- north and south -- that if you take the throne too young you won't last long. No matter how good he is, they think his uncles and more experienced family members will rule from behind him and that he could ultimately be sacrificed."" As pictures of ordinary North Koreans mourning the loss of their Dear Leader continued to filter onto television screens across South Korea Tuesday, Choi felt most people would have been struck by how staged they seemed. ""The pictures don't reflect the reality in North Korea,"" he argued. ""When Kim Il Sung died there were a number of people who really went out and cried because they really did respect him. ""Kim Jong Il's case is different because about two or three million people died of starvation after he came to power. The level of mourning will be about a tenth of what it was in 1994. This is the view of many defectors I have spoken to.""","Journalist: Announcement was greeted with general astonishment in Seoul .

"(CNN) -- Philippines authorities Tuesday started evacuating about 50,000 people living around the island nation's most active volcano after it oozed fiery lava and belched clouds of ash. A large-scale eruption was forecast as imminent. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology raised the alert level up a notch on Monday night to level 3. Scientist Alex Baloloy told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) that under level 3, ""a full-blown eruption is expected to take place within weeks to days."" He said seismic instruments detected 83 volcanic quakes, a majority of which were tremors associated with rockfalls. People in Albay province, about 466 kilometers (290 miles) south of the capital, Manila, flocked to town centers to catch a glimpse of glowing lava cascading down the slopes of Mayon. The volcanic mountain soars 2,464 meters (8,077 feet) into the sky and has erupted 49 times since the first documented eruption in 1616. Ash fell on the town of Guinabatan, prompting its mayor to predict an unwanted sort of white Christmas, PNA said. Provincial Gov. Joey Salceda ordered mandatory evacuation for residents of 45 towns and cities within a radius of 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) around Mayon, including Legazpi, Ligao, Tabaco, Daraga, Camalig, Guinobatan, Malilipot and Santo Domingo. The Albay Public Safety Emergency and Management Office said 9,946 families or 47,285 people were expected to be moved to safer ground within 72 hours, PNA reported. Salceda, who canceled a planned trip to Denmark for the global climate conference in Copenhagen, said he will meet with the provincial disaster coordinating council Tuesday to discuss emergency measures in case of an eruption, according to PNA. The Philippines is situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Mayon's most violent eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1,200 people and devastated several towns. Its last major eruption was in 1993. Since then, it has emitted ash and spewed lava but remained restless.","Scientists: Full-blown eruption is expected to take place within weeks to days .

"(CNN) -- Oklahoma State University women's basketball coach Kurt Budke and assistant coach Miranda Serna were killed when their plane crashed on the way to a recruiting trip in Arkansas, university officials said Friday. Former Oklahoma state Sen. Olin Branstetter and his wife, Paula, also died in the crash Thursday, university spokesman Gary Schutt said. ""It's a terribly sad day,"" he said. The crash occurred in Perry County, Arkansas, leaving no survivors. The plane, a Piper Cherokee PA-28, according to FAA records, crashed under ""unknown circumstances"" in a wooded area about four miles south of Perryville, Arkansas, about 4:30 p.m. CT on Thursday, agency spokesman Lynn Lunsford said Friday. No additional information about the crash was immediately available. The National Transportation Safety Board has sent investigators to the crash site, the agency said Friday. Budke and Serna were on a recruiting trip to Little Rock, Arkansas, the university said. ""For any coaching community to lose bright stars like Kurt and Miranda is tragic,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement. ""This is a profound loss for the Oklahoma State women's basketball family, the entire university and future women's basketball players as well."" University officials credited Budke for turning the school's women's basketball program around, culminating with a top-10 national ranking and an appearance in the second round of the NCAA tournament last season. He was in his seventh season with the school. ""Kurt was an exemplary leader and a man of character who had a profound impact on his student-athletes,"" Oklahoma State President Burns Hargis said. ""He was an outstanding coach and a wonderful person. We send our deepest sympathies to his wife, Shelley, and their children, Sara, Alex and Brett."" Serna was also in her seventh season with OSU after coming to the school to work for Budke from Louisana Tech, where they both previously worked. She served as the program's recruiting coordinator, according to the school. Hargis called her ""an up-and-coming coach and an outstanding role model for our young ladies."" ""Its our worst nightmare,"" he added. The school called off games scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, and grief counselors were on hand for athletes and staff, the university said. Jim Littell, the team's associate head coach, will take over as interim head coach, according to Mike Holder, OSU vice president for athletics. The crash is the second fatal plane crash to strike the OSU basketball program in nearly 11 years.

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Peruvian President Ollanta Humala has removed 30 of 55 generals in the national police, the largest such purge in the institution's history. The forced retirements, which were announced in the official gazette over the weekend, are widely seen as an attempt by Humala to combat corruption. Among those forced out was the head of the national police. The new head of the police, Raul Salazar, mentioned the need to fight corruption no less than six times during a speech at his induction ceremony. ""We have to uncover any act of corruption that stains the name of the police. From the most minimal to the most important, it doesn't matter, same if one sol or more are stolen,"" he said, referring to Peru's currency. In a separate interview on the state broadcaster Tuesday, Salazar said that fighting drug trafficking would remain a priority. The move means that until new generals are named, many regions in Peru, including many in the interior of the country, will be led by colonels instead of generals, something that opposition politicians have criticized. Critics also voiced concerns that the move was a ploy by Humala, as a new president, to place commanders loyal to him in the top posts. His interior minister, Oscar Valdes, said Tuesday that the retirements had to do with a reorganization of a bloated institution, the state-run Andina news agency reported. ""This is a studied measure, it is a re-engineering of the police,"" he said. ""It's not possible that the police has so many generals."" Before the purge, the police had 55 generals, 900 colonels, and more than 2,000 commanders, he said. Journalist Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this report.","The Peruvian president sacked 30 out of 55 police generals .

"El Paso, Texas (CNN) -- A brigade of U.S. troops originally scheduled to be among the very last to leave Iraq is being pulled out of the country months ahead of its planned departure, military officials said Saturday. The announcement follows news this month that a deal to keep American troops in Iraq past a December 31, 2011, deadline to withdraw was on shaky ground after Iraqi leadership said any remaining U.S. forces would not be granted immunity from Iraqi prosecution. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and other top brass have repeatedly said any deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the withdrawal deadline must require a guarantee of legal protection for American soldiers. The Fourth Brigade Combat Team, First Armored Division, based at Fort Bliss, deployed to Iraq in August to replace two withdrawing brigades. The troops were sent with the understanding they would be among the last to leave the country and were told to expect up to a 12-month deployment, though it wasn't clear how long they would stay in Iraq. But brigade officials informed hundreds of military families gathered Saturday at its headquarters that their troops would begin returning home within weeks. When family members inquired why soldiers were returning early, they were told by a military official: ""Basically, what's happened ... is that the United States and Iraq have not come to an agreement,"" according to a CNN reporter who attended the meeting. Additionally, the brigade official told families: ""We were over there for a couple of missions. Those missions are finished."" A U.S. military official in Iraq, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to CNN Saturday the early withdrawal of this brigade, citing a number of possible reasons, including the lack of a deal on the legal immunity issue and the fact that the State Department is ""standing up"" its operations faster than expected. When the United States and Iraq agreed in 2008 to a withdrawal deadline, the two countries also signed off on a Strategic Framework Agreement that calls for a long-term bilateral relationship. As part of that agreement, the State Department is deploying thousands of workers to Iraq to take over where military officials leave off in their dealings with the Iraqi government. U.S. officials in Washington on Saturday declined to comment on reports that troops were being withdrawn ahead of schedule or because of a breakdown in negotiations, except to say the United States is committed to withdrawing all troops by the December 31 deadline. ""At the same time we're building a comprehensive partnership with Iraq under the Strategic Framework Agreement including a robust security relationship, and discussions with the Iraqis about the nature of that relationship are ongoing,"" said Tommy Vietor of the National Security Council. Pentagon spokesman George Little also dismissed reports of a breakdown in talks with Iraqis, saying ""Suggestions that a final decision has been reached about our training relationship with the Iraqi government are wrong. Those discussions are ongoing."" Officials at Fort Bliss said the brigade's return is in line with the U.S. planned departure. ""In the process, we are bringing troops back home to meet the December 31st agreed-upon deadline,"" said Lt. Col. Dennis Swanson, a public affairs officer for the First Armored Division. When asked about the legal immunity issue, Major Gen. Dana J. H. Pittard, commander at Fort Bliss, said, ""We're going to do what's right by our soldiers."" ""We shouldn't see American soldiers in Iraqi courts on trumped-up charges,"" he said. His comments echo recent statements by Panetta and U.S. Army Chief of Staff Raymond Odierno. Panetta said last week that negotiations over the legal immunity issue are ongoing between Iraq's political leadership, U.S. Ambassador James F. Jeffrey and Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. The meetings include discussions about the rights of American troops and what will be required in order for those troops to assist Iraqi forces in the future, according to Panetta. ""If you're going to play a large role in dealing with another country where it requires, as I said, a large group of troops to be on the ground and to be dealing with that country, I want to make damn sure that you're protected,"" Panetta told sailors last Friday during a visit to Naples, Italy, home of the U.S. 6th Fleet. U.S. officials have been pressuring Iraq's leadership for months for an answer to whether it would request a troop extension, with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen saying over the summer that the U.S. needed a a decision by August. The negotiations have been strained following WikiLeaks' release of a diplomatic cable that alleged Iraqi civilians, including children, were killed in a 2006 raid by American troops rather than in an airstrike as initially reported by the U.S. military. The Pentagon dismissed the cable from U.N. investigator Philip Alston to U.S. officials, saying it had investigated the claims and found there was no merit. Shortly after the WikiLeaks cable gained attention in news reports in September by McClatchy Newspapers, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered an investigation into the deaths outside of Tikrit. U.S. officials have long said they believe Iraq may need help with training, counterterrorism, air defense, command and control and intelligence operations. Any U.S. troops remaining to do those jobs might also need additional security forces. The prospect of U.S. troops staying beyond the end of the year sits uncomfortably with many Iraqis, who have routinely questioned American motives following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose Sadrist political party is closely aligned with al-Maliki, has vowed to escalate armed resistance if the U.S. military does not leave as scheduled, a move that could destabilize the country should his militia repeat the bloody battles it waged against American and Iraqi forces during the height of violence. Odierno said last month that there would be risks in leaving a large force of U.S. troops in Iraq, noting such a force could provoke new claims of U.S. occupation and distract from efforts to develop the Iraqi military's abilities. He would not comment directly on reports that the White House administration had decided to leave between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, should they be requested by Iraq. Odierno, who served as the top U.S. commander in Iraq, said that training of Iraqi security forces was not complete. ""We need to probably be there to assist them at certain levels for a while,"" he said last month in a question-and-answer session with journalists at the Pentagon. As of last week, 41,000 U.S. military personnel remained in the country, according to Major Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, spokesman for U.S. Forces-Iraq. Buchanan said Wednesday that ""we are on track, and we will meet our requirement to redeploy the last remaining military personnel from 41,000 down to zero by the end of the year."" A brigade typically consists of between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers. CNN's Dan Lothian and Adam Levine contributed to this report.","The brigade was originally scheduled to be among the last to leave Iraq at the end of 2011 .

"Washington (CNN) -- John Hinckley Jr.'s relationships with women and his difficulties becoming part of a community away from a government mental hospital were spotlighted Thursday during a hearing to discuss whether the man who tried to kill President Ronald Reagan will eventually be allowed to live as an outpatient. An official at St. Elizabeths Hospital, where Hinckley, 56, has lived for decades after being found not guilty by reason of insanity, said Hinckley had been engaged to a former patient he met at the hospital. She was identified only as ""Miss CB,"" but the engagement recently ended. Dr. Tyler Jones, the facility's director of psychiatry, said Hinckley had given the woman ""multiple rings."" Jones said Hinckley had told him he'd explained to CB he planned to spend more time visiting his mother's home in Virginia and would be spending less time with her. As a result of that conversation, ""she's withdrawn the physical affection that they shared,"" Jones said. Federal prosecutor Colleen Kennedy also questioned Jones about Hinckley's past relationship with a patient identified as ""Miss X."" Kennedy said Hinckley had difficulty communicating with the woman because she was so psychotic, but he pursued the relationship because she was physically affectionate. Jones described Hinckley's actions as ""poor judgment"" motivated by his ""desire for affection."" According to Jones, another doctor told Hinckley the relationship was ill-advised and eventually Hinckley ended it. Hinckley has been spending 10 days a month visiting his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he works part time as a volunteer in the library at Eastern State Hospital, a mental health facility. Doctors have been encouraging him to make friends in Williamsburg and build a new life. Jones said Hinckley has had some difficulties. In one instance, he followed a suggestion to go to a singles group, but that did not turn out well. ""He was asked to leave,"" said Jones, because one participant was very uncomfortable with his presence. Since Hinckley likes music and plays the guitar, one of his doctors suggested he go play for hospice patients. But Jones said Hinckley never went because the hospice was worried there might be negative publicity if the presidential assailant played there. Another possible avenue for meeting people also has not panned out. Jones said Hinckley, when in Williamsburg, had not been interested in going to a gym or participating in certain sports like golf or tennis, either because of arthritis or because he finds the activities unappealing. The doctor said Hinckley's ""treatment team"" wants him to spend more time in Williamsburg and thinks he'll be able to fit into the community much better. A clinical psychologist from St. Elizabeths who has met with Hinckley five times conceded he's been unable to form relationships in that small city so far, aside from those with family members. ""He had not made a friend in Wiliamsburg,"" said Katherine Murphy. She stressed that Hinckley is an introvert and not the type to quickly make a lot of friends.""He's just not someone who goes and out and meets people or is a social butterfly."" But Murphy said Hinckley seems to have coped adequately when rejected in social situations and is ""not showing signs of isolation."" Murphy was involved in a psychological risk assessment of Hinckley. Both she and Dr. Jones said Hinckley represents a low risk of engaging in violence if granted permission to spend more time away from his mental hospital. A multiple-day hearing began Wednesday to discuss St. Elizabeths' recommendation that Hinckley be granted a series of eight longer visits ranging from 17 to 24 days. That plan also proposes that eventually the hospital would have the authority to let him live as a full-time outpatient. Prosecutors oppose the plan, saying they are concerned Hinckley is still potentially a danger. In opening arguments Tuesday, prosecutor Sarah Chasson said the court should not allow Hinckley to be released ""to protect public safety."" Chasson said Secret Service agents will testify they kept an eye on Hinckley in Williamsburg during the short periods of time earlier this year when he was allowed free time on his own. According to Chasson, the agents will testify about several occasions when Hinckley deviated from agreed-upon plans for how he would spend his time. Instead of going to movies, Hinckley went to bookstores where he looked at books about presidential assassinations and the failed Reagan assassination attempt, the prosecutor said. But Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said Thursday the actual Secret Service reports show he passed by bookshelves that had those books and other history titles but did not stop to read them. The controversy on the bookstore stops may continue until the Secret Service agents testify. The hearing resumes Monday and is scheduled to run about a week and a half. The judge may then take some period of time to review the testimony before issuing his ruling on the hospital's plan to gradually allow Hinckley greater freedom. So far, Hinckley has been sitting quietly and has shown no reaction to the testimony. On March 30, 1981, Hinckley waited for President Reagan to leave a Washington hotel after a speech. He opened fire and hit Reagan, his press secretary, James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police officer Thomas Delahanty. All survived, but Brady suffered a serious head wound that permanently affected his mobility and his speech. Brady and his wife became advocates for gun control.","Hinckley until recently was engaged to a former patient, a doctor says .

"(CNN) -- Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey said Thursday that three Occupy Denver activists have been charged with felonies -- including inciting a riot and second-degree assault on an officer. While Occupy Wall Street protests began in New York two months ago, the movement has spread to several other cities -- as have reports of activists clashing with police. Some of the most high-profile incidents have taken place in Denver, including two tied to the filing of felony charges. A pair of men who were arrested on Sunday were charged with felonies. The previous night, police in riot gear arrested 17 people as they cleared furniture and tents from an Occupy encampment near the city's civic center, police spokesman Sonny Jackson told CNN. The main issue, he said, was that the items were blocking a right of way. On Sunday afternoon, two police officers were injured when protesters became upset when police began removing a food table from a park. Some of the protesters surrounded a police car. One woman then pushed a Denver police officer, according to an earlier Denver police statement. She and a male who came to her aid were arrested. The district attorney's office announced Thursday that a 28-year-old man has been charged with two felony counts of inciting a riot and one misdemeanor count of obstruction for allegedly blocking a police car and and telling others to riot. He has two other cases pending from two different dates in October -- unlawful conduct on public property and unlawful sexual contact -- according to the press release. Another 30-year-old man was charged with a felony count of second-degree assault on a police officer -- as well as misdemeanor charges of obstruction, resisting arrest and engaging in a riot -- from the same day. The district attorney claimed this man grabbed a law enforcement officer from behind and tried to hit him and wrestle him to the ground. A third man, who is 26 years old, also was charged with second-degree assault of a police officer. That charge stems from an October 29 incident in which the man allegedly tried to use a stick to hit an officer who was trying to arrest him. That day, demonstrators tried to occupy the Colorado Capitol -- which is not allowed -- and officers pushed them back, police spokesman Matt Murray said at the time. Pepper spray and pepper-ball guns were used against demonstrators. The man charged, Sean Drigger, told CNN affiliate KUSA soon after the incident, ""All we're trying to do is have a peaceful protest and (the police) are attacking us.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Arizona said Tuesday they seized 44 firearms, 650 pounds of marijuana, 435 pounds of methamphetamine and $7.8 million in cash as part of a sting operation that successfully dismantled an ""extensive"" drug-trafficking ring. The operation, dubbed ""Operation Crank Call,"" also resulted in more than 200 arrests and the recovery of 123 pounds of cocaine and 4.5 pounds of heroin, Tempe, Arizona, police said in a statement. They worked with detectives from the Phoenix Drug Enforcement Administration during the 15-month investigation, at least a part of which was conducted undercover. ""The success of this operation is a direct result of Law Enforcement agencies working cooperatively toward a common goal. That goal is to rid our communities of organized crime,"" Tempe Chief of Police Tom Ryff said in the statement. ""These are sophisticated, criminal enterprises. As Chief of Police, I am committed to working in partnership with the community and other law enforcement agencies to curtail drug trafficking in the City of Tempe and throughout the valley,"" he added. Police said the dismantled trafficking ring was linked to the much-feared Sinaloa cartel, which has been blamed for widespread acts of violence across the border in Mexico. In October, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said that at least 70 suspected drug smugglers with alleged ties to the Sinaloa cartel had been arrested. More than 20 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies were involved in that 17-month investigation, dubbed ""Operation Pipeline Express.""","Authorities seize $7.8 in cash and make more than 200 arrests .

"Sirte, Libya (CNN) -- Mutassim Gadhafi, a son of ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, was reported captured Wednesday after a four-hour firefight in Sirte, said Abdallah Naker, the head of the Tripoli Revolutionary Council, who cited field commanders in Sirte as his sources. But two senior National Transitional Council spokesmen said the report was unconfirmed and a third reportedly denied the claim. Col. Ahmed Bani, the official spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said the capture had not been confirmed. And NTC spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN from Benghazi that the report had not been corroborated. Abudlmolah said Hassan al-Droyee, NTC's Sirte representative who is currently in Tripoli, denied the report. Mutassim Gadhafi and a number of aides were captured around noon in an area considered the center of operations for Gadhafi loyalists, Naker said. They were then taken to Benghazi, he said. The scion had been directing operations in Sirte, the hometown of his father, which had been surrounded since Tuesday night, Naker said. CNN teams in Tripoli and Sirte heard celebratory gunfire ring out as reports of the capture spread. From Benghazi, National Transitional Council spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said there was massive celebratory gunfire there, too.

"(CNN) -- An Oscar nomination, abs of steel and five leading roles in a 10-month span typically denotes Hollywood golden boy. Despite critical acclaim and a smoldering stare, Ryan Gosling still manages to fly under the radar with most of the moviegoing masses. The actor has already received praise for his performance as the press secretary/spin doctor to Gov. Mike Morris (George Clooney) in ""The Ides of March,"" which hits theaters Friday. And his role as heartthrob Noah Calhoun in 2004's ""The Notebook"" will continue to haunt mediocre boyfriends everywhere. Yet Gosling's movies, many of which are smaller films, don't always resonate at the box office. Consider this our public apology to you, Gosling, for not rewarding your hotness and all around good-guyness by making you a mega-star by now. We've loved you since you started out as a Mouseketeer on Disney's ""The Mickey Mouse Club,"" though we assure you it was in an age-appropriate way. So if his rocking bod and humble nature -- he told CNN that women are disappointed when they realize he's not Ryan Reynolds -- aren't enough to draw crowds, what is? Don't ask Clooney, Gosling's ""March"" co-star and director. The Los Angeles Times explored the likeness between the two leading men in September. Despite being adored by fans and critics, Clooney and his films don't always garner commercial success either, as the article pointed out. Remember ""Leatherheads,"" ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" and ""The American""? Each of those Clooney-starrers reportedly grossed between $31million and $35 million domestically, which is considered low these days for an A-lister. But like his ""March"" co-star, as Gosling sets hearts afire while his movies fail to do the same, the media only becomes more infatuated with the 30-year-old actor. First there was that amateur video of Gosling breaking up a New York street fight that surfaced in August. Then those heartwarming photos of the actor carrying his tired pooch around hit the Web. And what about that time he told UK paper The Times, via the New York Daily News, ""I'll make movies until I make babies."" Are you swooning yet? ""He is willing to show real vulnerability and ugliness,"" movie buff Leslie Henstock told MSNBC's Today.com. ""There are moments in 'The Notebook' when he is absolutely tragic, begging, weak. He has a journey."" It's safe to say Gosling has perfected the sexy, yet vulnerable persona. So much so that you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who didn't fall just a little bit in love with him after seeing ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" Speaking of that July release, with help from Steve Carell and Emma Stone, that flick brought in about $82 million domestically, making it Gosling's highest-grossing film by more than $40 million since ""The Notebook."" Frankly, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" -- Gosling's first mainstream film since the 2007 dud ""Fracture"" -- featured the actor's six-pack so prominently, it's a wonder it didn't break box-office records. Meanwhile, with a 93 out of 100 rating on Rotten Tomatoes, ""Drive"" was expected to find major box-office success upon its September release. However, the movie, which Gosling said was crafted to resemble a violent ""Pretty in Pink,"" has raked in $21 million domestically so far. It cost about $15 million to make. And December's ""Blue Valentine,"" co-starring Michelle Williams, brought in $9.7 million domestically after costing about $5 million to produce. So will the numbers continue to catch up with the hype surrounding the release of ""The Ides of March"" this weekend? At this point it may not even matter because Gosling will continue to heat things up.","Ryan Gosling started out as a Mouseketeer on Disney's ""The Mickey Mouse Club""

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi inspired Argentina as the two-time world champions came from behind to defeat Colombia 2-1 in a South American World Cup qualifying clash on Tuesday. Argentina went 1-0 down in Barranquilla after 44 minutes, when midfielder Javier Mascherano inadvertently deflected Dorlan Pabon's shot into his own net. But La Albiceleste rallied in the second half, with two-time world player of the year Messi equalizing after 60 minutes when Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina failed to gather Jose Sosa's cross. Substitute Sergio Aguero stole all three points for Argentina with six minutes remaining. The Manchester City striker was first to react when Ospina parried a shot from Real Madrid's Gonzalo Higuain, with Barcelona star Messi involved in the build-up. How should football tackle racism? The result kept Argentina second in the nine-team South American qualifying group, level on seven points with 2011 Copa America winners Uruguay and third-placed Venezuela. Uruguay have a game in hand over both rivals, having played only three qualifiers. ""It was hard,"" Messi, who was awarded the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2010 and is nominated for the accolade again this year, said after the match. ""We did not deserve to go a goal behind, as they were not better than us. ""Sometimes you play better, and other times you have to fight harder. This game was one of those days."" Ronaldo nets double as Portugal reach Euro 2012 . Venezuela joined Argentina on two wins, a draw and a defeat after beating Bolivia 1-0, with defender Oswaldo Vizcarrondo heading the only goal in the 23rd minute. The defeat left visiting Bolivia rock bottom with just one point from four matches. Ecuador moved into the fourth and final automatic qualifying spot courtesy of a 2-0 win over Peru in Quito. Midfielder Edison Mendez broke the deadlock in the 69th minute after being set up by striker Christian Benitez. Benitez, who plays his club football with Mexican outfit America, sealed Ecuador's triumph with a close-range strike in the closing minutes to keep his side unbeaten for 34 years in World Cup ties against Peru. Chile climbed above Colombia into fifth place and the one playoff berth after a 2-0 success against Paraguay. Claudio Borghi's team lost 4-0 to Uruguay last week, but Chile responded positively and took the lead through defender Pablo Contreras on 27 minutes. Fullback Matias Campos sealed victory with five minutes left, as Chile moved onto six points. The qualifying group usually has 10 countries, but Brazil's place is already guaranteed as the hosts of the 2014 tournament, when Mano Menezes' team will seek a sixth title.","Argentina come from behind to beat Colombia 2-1 in 2014 World Cup qualifier .

"Berlin (CNN) -- At least seven homemade explosives have been found along Berlin's railways within the last three days, police said Wednesday, severely disrupting traffic on several lines. Two of the devices have exploded -- one Monday and one on Wednesday, authorities said, but nobody was killed or injured in the blasts. Monday's explosion occurred next to a railway link between Hamburg and Berlin. The damage has not yet been repaired, authorities said. Since Monday, at least 2,000 trains have been delayed due to the attacks, a spokesman for Deutsche Bahn told CNN Wednesday. Another arson attempt -- this one on BerlinÃÂ´s central train station -- failed Monday because officials discovered the device before it exploded. ""The German national rail company Deutsche Bahn has become the victim of extremists. Nevertheless, our controls have been successful,"" said Gerd Neubeck, senior manager of the companyÃÂ´s security department, in a written statement Tuesday. Deutsche Bahn is offering a 100,000 euro (U.S. $138,120) reward for information leading to the arrests of those behind the blasts, according to a statement from the company. A group called the ""Hekla Welcome Committee-Initiative for More Social Eruptions"" has claimed responsibility for the explosions. ""This morning we slowed down the German capital and its function as a global player in the export of armaments,"" said a statement from the group released Monday on a leftist website. However, the group said it is not acting ""with the intention to endanger somebody's life."" The group blames GermanyÃÂ´s involvement in the Afghan war for the attacks. ""German soldiers kill in different parts of the world. For 10 years, the German armed forces are at war in Afghanistan -- without the agreement of the German people,"" Hekla said. At the beginning of October, a poll by the opinion research institute YouGov showed that two-thirds of all Germans do not believe in a successful military operation in Afghanistan anymore. The alleged attackers also demanded the release of U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning from jail and criticized U.S. military actions all over the world. Manning is accused of leaking thousands of classified U.S. military and State Department documents to the WikiLeaks website. The incendiary devices found in the past few days were filled with fluid and usually placed on cables, officials said. An investigation by the regional German police agency Landeskriminalamt is under way. ""I have ordered an immediate increase in police patrols around Berlin,"" German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said in a statement Wednesday. Sources from Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution told CNN Wednesday that the Hekla Welcome Committee was previously unknown to authorities. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. One source said German railways are a common target of leftist extremists. In May, a homemade explosive device hidden next to an important railway hub in the city's east caused massive delays. In the 1970s, the leftist Red Army Faction terrorized Germany through bank robberies, kidnappings and assassinations. Its members were accused in more than 30 deaths.","NEW: Germany's railway operator is offering a reward for information in the case .

"CNN -- South Korea midfielder Park Ji-Sung has made history by becoming the first player from his homeland to figure in the Champions League final, Europe's premier club match. Park's opening goal in the semifinal second leg against Arsenal set the tone for United's return to the final. However, his starting role in the match won't be one he'll remember with great fondness. His Manchester United side were outplayed as they lost 2-0 to Spanish side FC Barcelona. Profile: Park Ji-Sung . Still, the loss can't take away from what was a great season for the South Korean. Park was a key player for United throughout their European campaign this season, even scoring in his side's 3-0 second-leg win over Arsenal which sealed their passage to the final. Last year Park was a star player in the Red Devil's semifinal second-leg defeat of Barcelona before Alex Ferguson left him out of his entire squad for the final in Moscow against Chelsea. Park Ji-Sung speaks to CNN Â» . It is a memory that Park told CNN he was keen to banish: ""It would be amazing to me (to play) as I missed out last season. I believed I would get there again but never thought it would be so soon. Hopefully, this time I will be there."" Park attracts large audiences in South Korea where there is a large fan base for the club, a fact that has prompted Manchester United to travel to the capital Seoul in July as part of a close-season tour. ""It's not just in Korea that people will be watching (this game). It's the world's best match, and everybody wants to watch,"" Park said. Park started last night's match on the right-hand side, but didn't make his most impressive performance of the year. He did look more comfortable after switching to the left in the second half.","Ji-Sung Park could become the first South Korean to play in the final .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Money rewards are coming in for a woman who rescued a bleeding toddler left for dead last week by multiple passersby in southern China. Two hit-and-run drivers rammed into Wang Yue, 2, one after another, as she walked on a narrrow street in Foshan. More than a dozen people walked, cycled or drove past as she lay bleeding in a busy market, sparking a global outcry on the state of morality in a fast-changing society. Wang is in critical condition, her brain showing little activity despite earlier subtle movements in the lower body, said her mother, Qu Feifei. But despite the many villains in the story, it has also turned the spotlight on an unlikely hero: A 58-year-old scavenger. In the video that has sparked outrage globally, Chen Xianmei moves the baby to safety, becoming an instant symbol of understated decency in a nation analysts say is obsessed with climbing the economic ladder. ""I didn't think of anything at the time,"" Chen said Sunday. ""I just wanted to save the girl."" Two government offices in Guangdong province, where the hit-and-run occurred, offered the Good Samaritan a total of 20,000 yuan (US $3,135), according to state-run Xinhua news agency. Wang's mother has said she does not understand the behavior of the passersby, but wants to focus on the positive. ""Granny Chen represents the best of human nature,"" she said of her daughter's rescuer. ""It's the nicest and most natural side of us."" On Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, the story continued to be the No. 1 topic after generating more than 4.5 million posts along with a ""stop apathy"" online campaign. As the outrage over morality continues, a steady procession of well-wishers pours in, offering gifts, money and support to the toddler's family.","Two hit-and-run drivers rammed into the 2-year-old last week .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- The effort to rescue hundreds of trekkers stranded for six days in a town near Nepal's iconic Mount Everest due to bad weather continued Monday. With weather conditions improving Monday, the process of transporting the tourists to the nation's capital was fully under way, the tourism ministry said. ""The target is to transport 1,500 tourists to Kathmandu today,"" Hari Basyal, spokesman of the Nepal Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation told CNN. More than 2,200 tourists have been stranded in the village of Lukla since last week where food supplies are limited, Basyal said. Lukla, a popular starting point for people on their way to the world's tallest peak, is located in northeast Nepal. Stranded tourists took 48 flights and helicopter rides out of Lukla on Monday. A day earlier, at least 500 trekkers were flown to the capital. Last week, some of the tourists began a four-day walk to the town of Jiri to take buses to Kathmandu.","Bad weather conditions have stranded hundreds of trekkers .

"(CNN) -- Ireland's top Catholic cardinal is using the ""Nuremberg defense"" in the face of public outrage at his role 35 years ago in investigating one of the country's most notorious child-abusing priests, an activist said Tuesday. Cardinal Sean Brady has been under fire over the investigation into the Rev. Brendan Smyth. The latest scandal comes on the heels of a huge government-backed report that found the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up child abuse by priests from 1975 to 2004. Child sexual abuse was ""widespread"" then, the report found. Brady's office said Tuesday that the cardinal, then a priest and teacher with a doctorate in canon law, had been asked to investigate two complaints against Smyth in 1975, but had no decision-making power. He reported his findings to Bishop Francis McKiernan, his office said, and McKiernan recommended Smyth get psychiatric help. But John Kelly, the founder of Irish Survivors of Child Abuse, said Brady should not have remained silent about what he learned in the course of investigating Smyth, who was later convicted of dozens of counts of child abuse in both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. He died in prison. ""He's basically using the Nuremberg defense, he was carrying out orders,"" Kelly said, in reference to the justification many Nazis used in their war crimes trials after World War II. There has been particular outrage over the revelation that two boys who filed complaints against Smyth were asked to sign confidentiality statements as part of Brady's investigation. The oaths of secrecy were ""to avoid potential collusion"" between the two boys as church officials investigated the case, Ireland's Catholic Communications Office said Tuesday. Despite his criticism of Brady, Kelly said it would not necessarily do any good for the cardinal to resign. ""He's lost all moral authority to lead, but by replacing him, it won't resolve the problem,"" he said, arguing that the Vatican would ""just replace guys with other guys."" The best solution, he said, would be for the Roman Catholic Church to let secular authorities deal with accusations of abuse, rather than trying to handle them itself. ""They have to accept secular authority, and they can get on with the business of religion,"" Kelly said. ""It would be in the church's own interest. Resignations in themselves aren't the answer."" Four Irish bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the government-backed report, and Pope Benedict XVI is expected to make a formal statement, or pastoral letter, on the Irish abuse issue by Easter. The pope himself has been under fire since it was revealed that a priest suspected of abusing children was allowed to move into his diocese when he was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in Germany in 1980. The Archdiocese of Munich and Freising said in a statement Monday it must have been clear at the time that the priest, whom multiple sources identified to CNN as Peter Hullermann, was coming to get therapy for allegedly molesting children. He was convicted of abuse in 1986, after Ratzinger moved to Rome. Hullermann was suspended on Monday. Hundreds of allegations of sexual or physical abuse of children by Catholic clergy have come to light in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands this year. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin, Germany, contributed to this report.","Cardinal Sean Brady has been under fire over the investigation .

"Washington (CNN) -- A year and a half after deploying National Guard troops to counter illegal immigration on the Southwest border, the Department of Homeland Security and Pentagon told Congress Tuesday they are cutting the number of troops and changing their mission. The drawdown, which the department characterized as a ""transition,"" will begin in January and should be completed by March. Several lawmakers told CNN the number of National Guard troops on the border will be cut from 1,200 with responsibilities mainly on the ground to 300 who will support the border mission in the air. The Department of Homeland Security said the change is possible because of a jump in the number of Border Patrol officers in the region, an increase in technology and a drop in apprehensions at the border. But several lawmakers criticized the move, saying conditions on the Southwest border merit more troops, not fewer. A deployment of 1,200 troops was ""not enough to begin with, although they are doing as good a job as they can,"" Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, told CNN. Poe said the United States has ""operational control"" of only 44 percent of the Southwestern border. ""That's not success,"" Poe said. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, agreed. ""If the Obama administration's goal is border security, their actions undermine their objective,"" he said in a written statement. ""We should keep guardsmen on the ground until the Border Patrol can gain operational control of the majority of the U.S.-Mexico border."" But Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, supported the drawdown. ""While I appreciate the service of our National Guard forces, requiring them to engage in border law enforcement activity is not cost effective,"" he said in a statement. The Homeland Security Department said that in the fiscal year ending October 1, Border Patrol apprehensions of illegal immigrants -- a key indicator of the amount of illegal immigration -- decreased to 340,252, down 53 percent since fiscal year 2008. Since 2004, the size of the Border Patrol has doubled to 21,444. In a news release announcing the change, the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon did not cite exactly how many troops would be pulled from the border, but said the ""new strategic approach"" will increase border security. That approach includes ""adding a number of new multi-purpose aerial assets"" equipped with the ""latest surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities."" In addition, the National Guard will provide helicopters and planes to the Border Patrol, ""allowing for faster response capabilities,"" the news release said. ""I did not understand or get the impression they are going to add any equipment; they're going to use what they have,"" said Poe, who was briefed on the changes. The Defense Department budget for the border would drop by half, from $120 million to $60 million, congressional staffers said they were told. Specifics about the ramped-up aerial surveillance are still being worked out, the staffers said. Poe said he plans to fight the change. ""I'll ask the president to reconsider and then try to figure a way, bipartisan, to show that this is not a wise move,"" he said.","The transition will begin in January and be completed by March, DHS says .
