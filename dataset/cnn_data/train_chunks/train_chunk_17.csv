"(AOL Autos) -- If you don't eat, sleep and breathe cars, or devour car magazines in minute detail, there's a good chance you don't know all the technological terms that pop up in the media, new car advertising and literature. With new models being released all the time, the acronyms can be overwhelming. With every new model year, it seems, there are new technology and acronyms. Here's a concise list of the terms you're most likely to see and read about in the 2008 literature. ABS: The most common passive safety system found on cars today is ABS or anti-lock brake system. ABS continuously counts wheel revolutions electronically and when one or more wheels stops moving during a skid, the system quickly applies and releases the brakes on the skidding wheels. This is done so that the tires continue to rotate and the car can be steered around an object or an impending accident situation. Tires that are skidding can't do much steering. ALS: This is a relatively new term that stands for active lighting system or automatic lighting system. On some luxury vehicles, you can opt for headlamps that turn left or right (up to about 15 degrees) as the front tires turn to light the road as you make your turns. AWD (also FWD, RWD, 2WD, 4WD): These terms refer to how many and which wheels on your car deliver power from the engine to the road surface. AWD means all-wheel drive and generally means there are no buttons, levers or lower gear ranges. These systems can be full-time, driving all four wheels all the time, or part-time, controlled by computers when conditions dictate the need for more traction. The 4WD label means four-wheel drive and these part-time systems usually have a selector switch or lever to select two-wheel drive, four-wheel drive or even four-wheel drive in a lower gear or locked position for very difficult driving situations. In 2WD, only the two front or rear tires have power. Traditional RWD or rear-wheel drive is almost always found on luxury cars, sports cars, or racing cars. FWD or front-wheel drive is more compact and is more often found on small cars, minivans and crossover vehicles. DOHC: Engineering shorthand for double-overhead camshaft. A DOHC engine has one camshaft that opens the intake valves and one camshaft that opens the exhaust valves, a design derived from racing engines. DOHC engines are more complex than single-overhead-cam engines (SOHC) and overhead-valve engines (OHV) but generally make more power and torque at higher rpm levels because they let the engine breathe better. EBD: An acronym given to the ABS subsystem called electronic brake force distribution. EBD is rapidly becoming standard equipment on cars that already have ABS brakes. In a panic braking situation, EBD distributes the most braking force to the tires that have the most traction. This helps to keep the car from spinning and reduces stopping distances on slippery surfaces. ESC/ESP: Electronic stability control or electronic stability program are interchangeable terms for the same software and hardware. An extension of ABS, ESC uses sensors and computers to determine whether a vehicle is oversteering (rear wheels out) or understeering (front wheels not turning in the desired direction). ESC/ESP reduces engine power and/or applies one of the front or rear brakes to get the vehicle back into its intended path of travel. As a means of protecting against rollover accidents, ESC will be required on all new light vehicles sold in America by September 2011. GPS: All automotive navigation systems communicate with Global Positioning System or GPS satellites. GPS satellites were launched into orbit by the U.S. Department of Defense but are now used by motorists, hikers and explorers all over the world. GPS systems are accurate anywhere in the world from 10 to 50 feet. Combined with a CD or DVD map in the vehicle's navigation system, the satellites can track latitude, longitude, altitude and direction of travel in all weather conditions. I6 (also V6, V8, V10, W12, H4): These terms refer to the number and physical arrangement of cylinders in the engine. The I stands for inline, and means that the cylinders are lined up in a single row, (I4, I5, and I6, usually). V engines have two rows or banks of cylinders in a V pattern, with three, four, five or even six cylinders per bank, hence V-6, V-8, V-10, and V-12. The W engine used by Audi and VW has three rows of cylinders, in this case four cylinders, making it a W-12. Other engine designs include H-4 and H-6 engines, horizontally opposed or flat engines with either two or three cylinders on each side, a design used by Porsche (engine in the rear) and Subaru (engine in the front). The oddball engine on the U.S. market is the Wankel, a rotary engine used only in the Mazda RX-8. It has no cylinders, no banks and no reciprocating parts. L (as in 1.8L or 3.5L): L is for liters a metric measurement of engine size, also called displacement or swept volume, which has replaced cubic inches in the U.S. industry. It's the total volume of all the engine's cylinders. Smaller engines generally generate less power and use less fuel, larger engines make more and use more, so don't buy more engine than you need. RSC: One of the newest government regulations proposed for vehicles in the near future is protection against rollover accidents. The system that the industry has created to combat those is generally called roll stability control. RSC uses computers and sensors to analyze vehicle speed, steering wheel angle and body angle. If it senses that the vehicle is about to roll over, it cuts engine power and applies the brakes on one side or the other to bring the vehicle back to a stable position. TCS: Like ABS brakes, traction control systems are becoming more widely available, even on low-priced cars, because they add so much safety. A traction control system takes data from the ABS about tire rotation and compares the information in the computer. If one or two of the tires are spinning faster than they should be, indicating a loss of traction, the TCS system can cut engine power or engine torque going to the tires and apply brakes individually until the tires are all rotating at the same speed again. TPMS: This is a relatively new acronym that stands for tire-pressure monitoring system. The federal government has mandated that all vehicles in the future should have these systems to protect vehicles and occupants from rollovers and other accidents caused by low or deflating tires. Some currently available systems work by sending radio messages from each tire to the warning on the instrument panel. Others infer from the ABS system that one or more tires has a different rolling diameter, because it is going flat, than the other three tires and sends a warning to the instrument panel. VVT: Engineering term that stands for variable valve timing. Until a few years ago, timing the opening and closing of the engine's valves was a purely mechanical function and could not be varied. VVT systems use a combination of computers, engine oil pressure and mechanical linkages to change valve timing so that the engine idles smoothly, produces lots of power and torque when needed and burns fuel cleanly and economically.","Most common car safety system is ABS or anti-lock brake system .

"NHA TRANG, Vietnam  -- Editor's note: Football fans Daniel and Clinton Rowling were in Vietnam late December when the country won a major tournament for the first time. The event sparked wild celebrations in the South East Asian nation but joy soon turned to carnage as five people died and dozens were injured in the celebrations. They share their story. Celebration time: Five people were killed on Vietnamese roads as football joy got out of control. After spending a month in Vietnam we can safely say that the Vietnamese are passionate about three things: Ho Chi Minh, or Uncle Ho as the locals call him; football; and the tourist dollar. Everywhere you look you see football. The locals proudly sport imitation merchandise of their favorite European team anywhere and everywhere they can. Other than on your person, the next best place to show your allegiance is on your motorbike through stickers. Some local football teams even play in the strips of their favorite club. While we were in Vietnam the ASEAN cup was contested. It is the premier football contest in South East Asia. Every second year the countries of the region do battle for the crown. Up until 2008, the only winners of the cup had been Singapore and Thailand with three titles each (Indonesia has been the bridesmaid three times). After pool play, the best of two finals series was played out between Thailand and Vietnam. Thanks to the close proximity, and some historical conflict, there is a strong rivalry between these two countries. The Thais played host to the Vietnamese in the first leg, where the visiting underdogs were winners, stunning the home crowd by winning the match 2-1. The reverse leg was played in Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam. After unexpectedly winning the first final, local interest was even higher than normal. We watched the game in the coastal city of Nha Trang. The locals flocked to their TV sets and the beer flowed freely. Each TV was like a magnet for thirsty football fans. Do you have a great football tale to tell? Send us your story and you could be featured on Football Fanzone! We quickly realized there was a pecking order and that the most hardcore fans had the best seats, whilst the ""fair weather supporters"" were relegated to the back benches. As foreigners we were at the very bottom of the pecking order. We were resigned to watching the match from the street kerb on small plastic seats half in the rain which refused to dampen the crowds' spirits. Predictably Thailand took the lead and were up 1-0 (making it 2-2 on aggregate) and time was ticking away. Vietnam's tactic of playing breakaway ""Kung fu"" style football was looking largely ineffective against the more structured, controlled and dominant Thai approach. Still, the Vietnamese were doing enough to create the odd opportunity to gives the locals hope. Still tied up on aggregate, and with the end of regular time looming, the Vietnamese were awarded a free kick. The unexpected happened. The kick came in and a Vietnamese player managed to find it with the crown of his head sending the ball to the back of the net and the locals through the roof. Everyone jumped to their feet, there were hugs, high fives and toasts. As outsiders we sat stunned and could only watch the spectacle unfolding. With the game effectively over, the victors were overcome with emotion whilst the fans were overcome with energy. The locals were eager to include us in celebrations, with the nominated English speaker communicating with us in his limited vocabulary. We replied with our full Vietnamese vocabulary of smiles, nods and numerous thumbs up. The older men who had been doing the majority of the drinking were content  sitting and enjoying each other's company, while the younger and more boisterous sections of the crowd had their own form of celebration and they swiftly brought the streets alive with a massive motorcycle posse. Led by the rider with the biggest Vietnamese flag, they proceeded to lap the town honking their horns and generally getting excited. With the roads slick from a weeks worth of rain and the drivers impaired from a cocktail of excitement and alcohol, we wisely watched from the sidelines. After finding out that dozens of people were injured and there were even a few deaths -- it seems we made a good choice to keep out of it. But while we did watch on, we were left wondering: How do the passengers stay on the bikes when they jump up and down? How can anyone see where they are going with all the flags? And, where were the traffic police? We're offering a reward to anyone that can tell us what the Vietnamese supported before cable television brought top flight football to the masses. Whatever it was, we suspect it died a very quick death.","Daniel and Clinton Rowling in Vietnam when the country wins ASEAN Cup .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A police officer was killed Monday in a suicide bombing at the gate of a police station in Islamabad, authorities said. The bombing took place at a police station in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. The explosion occurred on Pakistan Day, a national holiday. The bomber apparently walked up to the police station and blew himself up at its gate. The station houses a special intelligence-gathering branch of Islamabad police. Two people -- the suicide bomber and a police officer -- were killed, police told CNN. Pakistan's GEO-TV reported three people were dead and 10 wounded in the blast. The blast blew the doors off the police branch and damaged a mosque adjacent to the building, according the network. ""Parts of the bodies, the human bodies, are spread around the area,"" GEO-TV's Hamid Mir told CNN. The explosion was heard at CNN's offices, 2 or 3 miles away. Members of the police branch housed in the building help protect government officials such as the prime minister, CNN's Reza Sayah said, and with the explosion, someone is ""trying to send another message to the federal government here in Islamabad.""  Watch more on the bombing » . ""(The blast) underscores the acute security situation this government is facing,"" he said. If the blast was a suicide bombing, it would be the second in the area within a week, Mir said. On March 16, a suicide attack targeted a bus station near Islamabad. The office targeted Monday is in a crowded area, said Mir, who added: ""This intelligence office is not secret. It's a very well-known intelligence office."" However, the area was not in a high-security zone, he said. Asked about the Pakistanis' attitude toward these repeated attacks, Mir said public opinion in Pakistan was divided. ""Everybody's against the terrorism, but they think the Americans also need to change their policies. They are in trouble after 9/11. America is secure, but the people in Pakistan are not secure."" CNN's Ram Ramgopal contributed to this report.","A loud explosion has been heard in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital .

"CHINHOYI, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was celebrating his 85th birthday with a lavish all-day party Saturday despite the fact that the country is gripped by an economic and health crisis. President Robert Mugabe and his wife, Grace, attend a cake-cutting ceremony for his birthday Saturday. Mugabe's ZANU-PF party said it raised at least $250,000 to hold the party in Mugabe's hometown of Chinhoyi, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) outside of the capital, Harare. Critics of the president say the country is desperate for that amount of money to be spent instead on its citizens, who are suffering from a cholera outbreak, food shortages, and spiraling hyperinflation. On Friday, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai visited a hospital's closed intensive care unit that he said needed $30,000 to resume operating. During the celebrations, Mugabe announced that his controversial land reform would not be reversed. The program is designed to have white-owned farms given to blacks, and there have been violent seizures of such farms since the program began in 2000.  Watch Mugabe's birthday bash » . He emphasized that the country's ""indigenization program"" -- which forces all major foreign companies operating in Zimbabwe to have at least 51 percent black ownership -- will be carried out. It began last year and hasn't been implemented yet. Mugabe's birthday falls on February 21 but his party loyalists postponed the celebrations as they were raising money for the event. ""I think it is going to be a great day for the legend and icon whose birthday we are celebrating today here,"" said Mugabe's nephew Patrick Zhuwawo, one of the fund-raisers for the birthday. ""The country might be having problems, but we need to have a day to honor the sacrifices the president has made for this country."" What do you think about the celebrations? Zhuwawo said about 100 beasts would be slaughtered for the birthday bash. iReport.com: What do you think about Mugabe's lavish party? Mugabe also invited schoolchildren from around the country to attend the party, being held at Chinhoyi University. The farming town of Chinhoyi is usually quiet, but Saturday's event has changed everything. Cars with Mugabe's supporters could be seen hooting and some ZANU-PF supporters sang Mugabe's praises. A banner in Chinhoyi read, ""Age ain't nothing but a number."" Mugabe invited Tsvangirai, his new partner in a power-sharing government, but a Tsvangirai spokesman said the opposition party leader turned it down. He said it is political party function, with most of the attendees being ZANU-PF elite. As the prime minister, Tsvangirai is not obligated to attend, the spokesman said. The spokesman would not acknowledge whether Tsvangirai had initially agreed to attend, but it was widely reported in Zimbabwean media that he had agreed to do so. ""Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments, as far as I know,"" said Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change. Tsvangirai last year said Mugabe's birthday party was ""a gathering of the satisfied few."" But at that point, he and the president were preparing to face off in a hotly contested presidential election. As Saturday's celebrations began in a carnival atmosphere, just less than a kilometer (0.62 miles) away stood a deserted Chinhoyi government hospital -- a reflection of the country's dire health situation. A few nurses are attending to patients. ""There are no medicines. These patients have no option but to come here, but there is nothing we can do,"" said one nurse at the hospital. On Friday Tsvangirai visited Harare Hospital, one of the country's biggest, and said its intensive care unit will need $30,000 in order to start operating again after a funding shortage. Once a darling of Zimbabwe, Mugabe is blamed for driving the country into a meltdown. A cholera epidemic that broke out in August has since hit every corner of the country, killing 3,731 people and infecting nearly 80,000, according to the World Health Organization, which quoted Zimbabwe's Ministry of Health. The preventable disease has spread through Zimbabwe's 10 provinces through lack of access to clean water, faulty sewage systems, and uncollected refuse, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), which released a report this month on the outbreak. The problems, MSF said, are ""clear symptoms of the breakdown in infrastructure resulting from Zimbabwe's political and economic meltdown."" On Sunday, Tsvangirai appealed to the international community to help Zimbabwe's crippled economy, saying it would take $5 billion to stabilize the country. The cholera outbreak has worsened Zimbabwe's economic crisis. Failed government policies and an acute food shortage because of years of poor agricultural production and widespread corruption have ravaged the currency of Zimbabwe, which has the world's highest inflation rate.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Militants in Nigeria's oil-rich southern delta region said they killed six government soldiers after the military attacked one of its camps on Thursday. Heavily armed Nigerian rebels pose a constant threat to oil pipelines in the country. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, in an e-mail, said three military gunboats attacked one of its camps around the Ke River in the country's Rivers state. The group said the gunboats were repelled, with six soldiers dying and three militant fighters wounded in the skirmish. There was no immediate reaction from the government. Nigeria is Africa's largest crude oil producer and the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States. MEND has demanded that more of the country's oil wealth be pumped into the region instead of enriching foreign investors, and the militants have been attacking oil pipelines in retaliation against government forces, limiting the amount of crude oil that can leave the country. MEND -- the largest rebel group -- has targeted foreign oil companies since 2006. It has bombed pipelines and kidnapped hundreds of foreign oil workers, typically releasing them unharmed, sometimes after receiving a ransom payment. MEND hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for people in the delta, where more than 70 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day. Its attacks on oil facilities have taken a toll. ""Anytime a pipeline is affected, anytime any production gets shut down, you see oil prices jump up one or two dollars a barrel just because there is no slack in the system,"" said Jim LeCamp, a senior vice president with RBC Wealth Management, which manages assets for wealthy clients worldwide. Exxon and Shell are two of several companies that have been extracting 2 million barrels of oil a day in Nigeria. Recent rebel attacks on oil pipelines in the Niger Delta have cut overall production by roughly 10 percent -- meaning 200,000 fewer barrels of oil on some days. That decrease in production comes at a time of increased demand from oil-hungry regions such as China, Russia and Latin America. ""Anytime there's a disruption there, it really affects the system,"" LeCamp said in a recent interview with CNN.","Militants in Nigeria's oil-rich southern delta region say they killed 6 soldiers .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An English football club is being forced to close a stand at its 25,000-seat stadium to cut costs, in what could be the first of many similar moves at other clubs, a sports business expert predicts. Darlington Arena, home of English club side Darlington F.C., where a stand will be closed to cut costs. The affected club, Darlington F.C., is currently in seventh place in League Two, however, it slumped into administration last week following problems attracting crowds to the home matches. The average home crowd at the stadium is currently below 3000 people. Ticket prices are £16 ($22) per adult. The move to close the west stand at its ground, Darlington Arena, is an attempt to improve the atmosphere and cut costs at the club, the side's commercial director, Christine Balford, said on the club's Web site. Balford said the move was forced by administrators. ""This is an attempt to improve the atmosphere at home games, whilst saving costs. ""All season ticket holders will be temporarily relocated and will be able to use the facilities of the south stand,"" Balford said. Darlington F.C. has also increased the cover price of match day programs and has cut the number of complimentary tickets given away for home matches. Professor Simon Chadwick, director of the Center for the International Business of Sport (CIBS) at Coventry University, UK, told CNN that many football clubs may soon find themselves in the position of having to make a similar move. ""This is the economic reality of having to strip costs. ""Generally, League One and League Two and even some Premier League clubs may be affected. What you will start to see is other clubs having to follow suit."" Chadwick said Darlington's case was a particularly bad one as they had a stadium which was far too big for the club's size. However, the issue of crowds not filling stadiums was a wider concern for many clubs. ""This is their life-blood. A lot of their revenue comes from selling tickets ...if they're not filling stadiums then it is a big issue for them,"" he said. Chadwick said closing stands could help cut match-day costs and was often a more palatable option for fans, rather than selling players.","English club Darlington F.C. closes stand to cut costs and improve atmosphere .

"(CNN) -- Over the next week CNN has special coverage of one of the world's biggest gatherings of the luxury industry from Basel, Switzerland, bringing you the views of the people behind some of the biggest brands. Companies suggest the top tier of luxury goods is less affected by the downturn. In this time of economic upheaval, these brands are being put to the test. People are spending their hard-earned money much more carefully. If they're going to shell out thousands of dollars for a timepiece or a trinket they want to know it's worth it. A luxury brand's name, history and quality are cornerstones of its marketing and advertising. But is that enough? That is the question we will ask the CEOs of brands like Chopard, Bulgari, Patek Phillippe and Tag Heuer, to name a few. There are conflicting reports over whether luxury brands are immune to the effects of a recession. Some suggest that people are not spending as much as they used to. Renowned British department store Harvey Nichols, which houses high-end luxury goods, posted a 40 percent drop in profits and a 5 percent drop in sales in the year ending March 31, 2009. Other reports however suggest that consumers are still spending, just more carefully. The CEOs of the high-end brands like Boucheron and Patek Phillippe tell us there are three tiers in the luxury industry: the lower level where the brand's name is licensed and goods are mass marketed, the mid range where products are expensive but still widely available, and then there's the top tier where the goods are only available to a select few. These products are very expensive and only a few pieces are produced. Companies suggest this top tier isn't really affected by the downturn as consumers at this level still can afford to spend. Can luxury brands survive? Send us your views . The CEOs also suggest this downturn means a return to the notion of true luxury that is defined by its aspirational, not affordable quality of a product or a lifestyle. Geography plays a big part in a brand and company's sales and profitability. Before the credit crunch, the United States was the top market for luxury goods. Today some reports indicate that China has surpassed the U.S. for its hunger for designer brands. According to chinadaily.com, China consumed $8.6 billion worth of luxury goods in the two years ending January 2009. The Middle East and emerging markets like India are also major hubs of luxury consumption as importers of luxury brands. Here companies have set up shop in cities from Dubai to Delhi. These markets have been seen almost as the life rafts in this turbulent economy because there, the thinking is, people will still spend, spend, spend on known brands. Last year at Baselworld, the then-CEO of the luxury watch brand Ebel, Thomas van der Kellen, told us that consumers in the emerging markets ""are growing opportunities for the luxury watch business...the money is there, it's very much a branded culture..so we see a lot of opportunity to make up for potential loss on the western hemisphere."" The bottom line for all brands in the luxury industry is no one is exempt from feeling the constrictions of the market. Every aspect of the business is and will be affected in some way, whether it's at the production end (rising costs of raw materials and manufacturing) to the retail end (flow of traffic into their stores). What separates those who will survive and even flourish in this industry are the ones that define themselves as true and aspirational luxury where the product is seen as an investment and worth it.","Next week CNN focuses on some of the biggest names in luxury goods .

"(CNN) -- An eruption may not be imminent after all for Alaska's Mount Redoubt, authorities said Thursday. Fears that Alaska's Mount Redoubt would erupt have diminished. ""For the past two weeks or so, the seismic activity at Redoubt volcano has significantly decreased,"" said Michelle Coombs, a geologist for the Alaska Volcano Observatory and the U.S. Geological Survey. The status is now at a ""yellow"" level, meaning the volcano is ""exhibiting heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption, timeframe uncertain, or eruption is underway with no or minor volcanic-ash emissions."" In late January, experts began paying close attention to the volcano and raised the alert to ""orange,"" indicating that it could erupt at any time. ""We believe based on what we're seeing now, that if it were to erupt, that we would see enough increase in seismic activity to give us sufficient warning to go back up to orange,"" Coombs said. Two other volcanoes in Alaska are also at the ""yellow"" status currently, and Mount Redoubt could remain at that level for months, Coombs said. ""There's a certain level of unpredictability,"" she said. The 10,197-foot peak is located in southern Alaska, about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage, the state's most populous city. Mount Redoubt last erupted nearly 20 years ago, in December 1989. That eruption lasted until April 1990.

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- Basketball great Charles Barkley began serving a three-day sentence in Arizona's infamous Tent City on Saturday, jailed by the same sheriff whose autobiography he endorsed 12 years ago. Charles Barkley bristled at the implication he should be wearing stripes instead of a red-and-bue sweatsuit. ""You come here when you screw up,"" Barkley said at a news conference hours after he reported at the Maricopa County jail. ""I don't blame anybody for this situation but myself."" Barkley, 45, pleaded guilty last month to misdemeanor drunken-driving charges stemming from a New Year's Eve arrest after he left a Scottsdale, Arizona, nightclub. A judge sentenced him to 10 days in jail, but his sentence was reduced in exchange for Barkley's attending an alcohol-awareness course. At the news conference, Barkley sat next to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed ""Toughest Sheriff in America."" Arpaio is known for giving inmates old-fashioned, black-and-white-striped uniforms, making some of them live in tents and reinstituting chain gangs, even for women. ""I'm an equal incarcerator,"" Arpaio said of Barkley, who will be sleeping in one of the tents. ""We don't discriminate."" He said Barkley has been ""a gentleman, cordial."" ""He's taking his medicine,"" Arpaio said. ""I hope that something comes out of this."" In a free-wheeling news conference, Barkley spoke out against drunken driving, made some observations about President Obama (""Rush Limbaugh and a lot of jackasses are giving him a hard time right now"") and commented on felony charges singer Chris Brown faces for allegedly beating his girlfriend, singer Rhianna.  Watch Barkley speak at news conference » . ""I wish both of them the best, but it's never acceptable to hit a woman. Period,"" Barkley said. Barkley wore a red-and-blue sweatsuit, not the black-and-white stripes that other inmates -- who watched the news conference through a chain-link fence --were wearing. Barkley said it's because he's on the jail's work-release program, and bristled at questions about it. ""None of the work-release people do that,"" he said. ""But if y'all really, really want to put me as low as I can go, I can do that and make you feel better. ""I know when [someone is] famous, you like to see people humiliated."" Arpaio, who joked with Barkley over the pink underwear he routinely issues inmates, held up a copy of his 1996 book, ""America's Toughest Sheriff."" On its back cover, alongside endorsements by Limbaugh, Arizona Sen. John McCain and others, is one from Barkley. ""This man, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, is a role model for all Americans,"" Barkley wrote in the blurb. Barkley is a basketball commentator for TNT, which like CNN is a Time Warner company. A star for the Philadelphia 76ers and Phoenix Suns, Barkley was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 1993 and inducted into its Hall of Fame in 2006.","Charles Barkley begins serving 3-day jail sentence in Maricopa County, Arizona .

"(CNN) -- An Air Force nurse has been charged with murdering three terminally ill patients by giving them fatal overdoses, the Air Force said Tuesday. Capt. Michael Fontana is continuing to work at Wildford Hall Medical Center. Capt. Michael Fontana, a nurse at Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, also was charged Monday with conduct unbecoming an officer for changing a medical document. ""The charges are the result of an Air Force investigation that occurred after irregularities were discovered in Capt. Fontana's administration of medications which may have resulted in the death of an end-of-life patient,"" hospital spokesman David Smith told reporters. The nurse was charged with three counts of violating Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. ""It is considered murder,"" Smith said. After an Article 32 hearing, akin to a civilian grand jury proceeding, the commander will decide whether the case goes to court-martial. The three deaths occurred in July, Smith said. He cited the privacy act in refusing to divulge the suspect's age and hometown. He said he did not know the motive but was confident no other patients were victimized. ""We know that there are no other patients involved in this case,"" he said. Fontana, an intensive-care unit nurse who has been working at the hospital since 2006, the year he joined the Air Force, has been released on his own recognizance and is continuing to work at the hospital, though he is no longer involved in patient care, Smith said. ""As far as we can tell, he has been an exemplary nurse,"" Smith said. Fontana also served as a nurse at the Air Force Theater Hospital in Balad, Iraq, Smith said. His work there was investigated, ""and there was nothing found,"" he said. A call to a San Antonio phone number listed as belonging to Michael Fontana got a message that said, ""Thank you for calling. Due to the ongoing investigation, I have no comment for you right now, but I do appreciate your call and will talk to you soon."" Relatives of the dead patients have requested privacy, the Air Force said.

Before joining the newspaper, she was a senior adviser for the Republican National Committee and was named a public affairs director in the Department of Health and Human Services by President Bush. Read her columns here. Tara Wall says President Bush will be remembered for keeping America safe. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In his final radio address as president-elect on the Sunday ahead of his inauguration, Barack Obama said President Bush ""extended the hand of cooperation"" to him throughout this period of transition. It was a final act of civility, on Mr. Bush's part. It is a trait that is not surprising to those who know Bush (or those paying some attention at least half of the time). At least one Democrat has given him credit for it. Unfortunately, that tone of civility has been lost on the Democratic leadership over the past eight years. Civility aside, how others -- more importantly, history -- will judge the 43rd president of the United States, is the question that has followed Bush out the door. Lucky for him, it won't just be up to Democrats to determine. ""I believe President Bush will be vindicated,"" said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in an interview a couple of weeks ago. She may be an ardent defender of Bush, but I believe she's right. She, like I, have a different vantage point than what has been routinely portrayed. While sitting in the Oval Office with the 43rd president, for what was his last official week in office last Thursday, I got the sense that he feels he will be vindicated, too. He won't say as much, directly, but indirectly points to what matters most in his eyes -- protecting the homeland. ""History will eventually see ... that not only was it necessary to take the steps I took, but [they] led to a better world,"" the president told me. On a personal level (and for the sake of full disclosure), I must say that I have had the pleasure of working for and knowing Bush from his first campaign for president and throughout his presidency. I started as a volunteer in 1999, then worked as a spokeswoman during his second campaign and then as an appointee in his administration. Not only have I counted it an honor and a privilege to serve the 43rd president, but I have always had a deep respect for him as a person of faith, his strident conviction in doing what was right for the country and his commitment to closing the disparities that exist between black and white Americans -- no matter the mistakes made and lessons learned. Above all, it is his dignity and civility that stand out to me most. Yet, for many conservatives (not just liberals), Bush has failed on many fronts. From the miscalculation of the insurgency in Iraq, to failed intelligence gathering and the issues of maintaining fiscal conservatism and delivering real immigration reform -- I can't tell you how many Republicans and conservatives I've spoken to over this past year who have told me how ""disappointed"" they've been with Bush. A few among them voted for ""change"" as a result. The legacy Bush leaves behind won't be everything he wanted (particularly as it relates to popularity), but on many fronts, it will be better than that of his predecessor. Bill Clinton may have been popular, but his moral failings brought shame on the office of the presidency and tainted the people's house. That will forever be a stain on Clinton's legacy. Not to mention, there was no such ""civility"" or ""cooperation"" when Clinton turned the keys over to Bush. I prefer principle over popularity any day. On the moral front, President Bush delivered. On the social front, he delivered. On the fiscal front he failed considerably. Yet, on the national security front and on many domestic policies, he succeeded. Depending on your vantage point, success may mean something wholly different. The details will be debated for decades to come. Among the many uncertainties, one thing is certain -- you can't judge history in the midst of it. Declaring one ""the worst"" president while he's still in office is an effort in rhetorical futility. Historians know this all too well. The best prediction one can make was summed up by presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin on ""Meet the Press"" last year: ""If Iraq became the model democracy or even just a democracy, and in doing so changed the whole complexion of the Middle East, then obviously that would be the legacy that would justify what Bush did and what our troops did."" And that's exactly what Mr. Bush is banking on. During my Oval Office interview with the president, I asked him to complete the sentence ""President Bush was... [fill in the blank]."" He responded (uncharacteristically in third person): ""President Bush was the president at a time when our nation was attacked, he clearly saw the dangers, he pursued the enemy, he put tools in place so the professionals could better protect the people, and the homeland was not attacked."" That is the legacy he wants. Popular or not, he kept America safe. And if nothing else, for that, he will be vindicated. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tara Wall.","Tara Wall: Barack Obama praised President Bush for cooperative nature of transition .

"(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama, President Bush and all of the surviving past presidents got together Wednesday for a historic meeting at the White House. Barack Obama meets with President Bush and past presidents in the Oval Office on Wednesday. ""One message that I have, and I think we all share, is that we want you to succeed. Whether we're Democrat or Republican, we care deeply about this country,"" Bush told Obama before lunch with the former presidents. Bush and Obama were joined by Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Obama thanked the president for hosting them and said he was grateful for the opportunity to get ""advice, good counsel and fellowship"" from the group.  Watch what Obama says about the meeting » . Obama's press secretary said the presidents had a ""very constructive conversation"" and Obama appreciated ""the spirit of bipartisanship they showed"" in wishing him success. ""The president and the former presidents had helpful advice on managing the office, as well as thoughts on the critical issues facing the country right now. The president-elect is anxious to stay in touch with all of them in the coming years,""  Robert Gibbs said. Presidential historian Doug Brinkley said it's ""very smart politics for Obama to keep a channel open"" with the former presidents. ""If he has a policy initiative that he wants to lead the country behind ... if he could get the signatures, the green light from all of the ex-presidents to say, 'Not only am I for this, but I have all of the ex-presidents backing me' -- that's powerful,"" he said. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the last time all of the living presidents got together at the White House was in 1981, and she called Wednesday's meeting a ""historic moment."" She said the president was ""delighted"" to host the luncheon. ""Each of them expressed their desire for President-elect Obama to have a very successful presidency. During the lunch, they had a wide-ranging discussion on many different issues facing the United States, and they all look forward to remaining in contact in the future,""  Perino said. The meeting marked the second time Bush has hosted Obama since the election. Obama suggested the meeting with all of the former presidents when he and Bush first met in November. Perino said earlier she didn't know what they would talk about, but she said she'd love to be able to hear it. ""I'm sure all of us would love to be flies on the wall and listening to that conversation,"" Perino said during Tuesday's daily news briefing. Perino speculated that they would discuss what it's like to raise children in the White House and how to protect them. Brinkley predicted that first and foremost, the presidents would recall what it was like to be president. ""All of them will have little anecdotes. They'll see something in the White House that will bring back a memory. They'll try to bring some levity to this -- make it a very special and engaging and actually a fun afternoon for Barack Obama,"" he said. Secondly, Brinkley said, the conversation would probably turn to what's going on in the Middle East. Brinkley said that all of the men will be on their ""best behavior,"" but, given the personalities at the luncheon, there could be some tension. ""The friction, if there is any, is between Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, who are known to not like each other at all,"" he said, pointing out that the Clinton team did not like Carter ""parachuting for peace into Bosnia, North Korea and Haiti"" during Clinton's administration. ""That's the relationship that is not warm, it's not good, and if you are a body language expert, you might home in on that,"" he said. President Bush may find himself the odd man out at the meeting, at least in terms of popularity. Bush registered only a 27 percent approval rating in a December CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey. In contrast, Obama had an 82 percent approval rating. A new poll out Wednesday indicates that 69 percent of adult Americans approved of how Clinton handled his job as president, while 64 percent of adult Americans gave a thumbs up to Carter and 60 percent approved of George H.W. Bush. CNN's Lauren Kornreich contributed to this report .","Historian calls meeting ""smart politics,"" says it'll be light, but could be tense .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- France is sending four state police units to its overseas department of Guadeloupe after a month of sometimes violent demonstrations, Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said Thursday. French gendarmes face-off against Guadeloupe protesters. ""The pillaging ... the violence against people, are not tolerable and will not be tolerated,"" Alliot-Marie told the French radio station RTL. ""It's no longer simply a question of containing the protests. ... This mission of honor will continue to be undertaken, but we also have to fight against the violence."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy planned to meet with elected officials from overseas departments, including Guadeloupe, Thursday afternoon, his office announced. A general strike over low wages and living conditions in the Caribbean island has included demonstrations and clashes with police. At least one civilian has been killed in the riots, officials said. Hospitals and emergency services continue to function and the main international airport is open, but petrol stations, schools, and most businesses -- including supermarkets and car rental offices -- are closed, the British Foreign Office said in a travel advisory. Hotels are open, but the strike is causing daily cuts to electricity and water supplies, the Foreign Office said. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said Thursday he is ready to approve a compromise that would give nearly a €200 ($254) monthly supplement to workers in Guadeloupe with low-paying jobs. ""This crisis is serious, and profound, but it's not new,"" Fillon said, adding that it's linked to ""the lifelessness of the economy in the Antilles, aggravated by the global economic crisis."" Sending supplementary police forces is justified, Fillon said, because ""we cannot accept what has happened"" in the department. He was referring to the attacks on businesses, the roadblocks in the streets and above all, the death of the civilian, who he said was a union leader. Agence France-Presse identified the victim as union representative Jacques Bino. He was shot dead Tuesday night when he drove past a roadblock manned by armed youths in the city of Pointe-a-Pitre. His car was hit three times by shotgun fire, prosecutors told AFP. Three police who accompanied emergency services trying to help the dying man were lightly wounded, officials said, according to AFP. Speaking with RTL on Wednesday, one demonstrator denied he was fanning the flames of unrest. ""We have always called for calm,"" Elie Domota, leader of the Coalition against Exploitation, said. ""We have told the young people to go to their homes and continue to protest peacefully, but the police yesterday beat protesters and called them racist names, so the situation escalated.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British reality TV celebrity Jade Goody died early Sunday morning following a public battle with cervical cancer, her publicist has announced. Jade Goody married her fiance Jack Tweed weeks before her death. Goody, 27, died in her sleep at home in Essex, east of London, just before 4 a.m. (midnight Eastern Daylight Time), a spokeswoman for Max Clifford Associates said. Goody's husband, Jack Tweed, who she married last month in a lavish wedding ceremony, was at her bedside when she died, Clifford said. Her mother, Jackiey Budden, who was also at the house, said: ""My beautiful daughter is at peace."" Goody leaves behind two sons, Bobby, 5, and Freddie, 4, by former boyfriend and TV host Jeff Brazier. ""She died knowing that she had touched a lot of hearts and minds across the world,"" Clifford told CNN by phone from Portugal. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was ""deeply saddened"" by Goody's death. ""Her family can be extremely proud of the work she has done to raise awareness of cervical cancer which will benefit thousands of women across the U.K. Every death from cancer is a tragedy and my thoughts go out to her two sons, husband and family at this time,"" Brown said in a statement. The British media has reported a rise in the number of screenings for cervical cancer since Goody announced she had the disease, a phenomenon some have dubbed the ""Jade Goody effect."" Goody's death marks the tragic end to a very modern tale. Images of her shrinking frame and bald head have dominated the pages of British media since she announced she had just weeks to live. However, she has openly courted the attention since bursting into the spotlight courtesy of the British version of ""Big Brother"" in 2002. At first the former dental nurse was a hate figure for Britain's vociferous tabloid newspapers, who attacked her for being ignorant and stupid. The public, however, warmed to her loud, honest streak. She did not win the series, but was able to parlay her popularity into a series of reality television and business deals. Her face was soon regularly boldly looking out from the cover of gossip magazines and you could buy the fragrance Shh... Jade Goody, fitness DVDs or pick up a copy of her autobiography. In 2007, with her fame starting to dip, she agreed to return for the celebrity edition of ""Big Brother,"" with her mother and then boyfriend, Jack Tweed, joining her in the house. It was to prove an ill-fated decision. Goody was soon accused of making racist comments and bullying her housemate -- the Indian actress Shilpa Shetty. More than 50,000 complaints were received. When she was voted out of the house the show's producers took the unusual step of banning the public from attending her eviction. Goody was tearful and apologetic but British PR guru Clifford summed up the general opinion at the time by saying: ""It looks like she has ruined a very lucrative career."" Ever resilient, Goody had a Christmas cookbook out at the end of 2007 and in 2008 signed up for India's version of ""Big Brother."" Two days into the show her cancer diagnosis was revealed on air. She flew home immediately to begin treatment. Last month Goody revealed her cancer was terminal and that she only had weeks to live. With typical bravado she, with Clifford's help, organized her wedding to Tweed, who had only just been released from prison after serving a sentence for assault, selling the exclusive rights to OK! magazine for a reported $970,000. It was also filmed for her reality TV show. Read blog about how media covered wedding . The British government even stepped in to extend Tweed's 7 p.m. curfew, a condition of his release from jail, so the couple could spend their wedding night together.  Watch Jade Goody's wedding preparations » . Despite her weakening state Goody continued to open her door to the media, saying she needed to keep selling her story to help secure the future of her sons. In the days leading up to her death there were newspaper stories on a hammer-wielding woman getting into her room, the baptism of her sons, her last view of ""sun-kissed"" fields and final farewells with family. There was also controversy when OK! published a memorial issue nearly a week before she died. The issue, with a coverline announcing ""Jady Goody, 1981-2009,"" went on sale Tuesday. Clifford said Goody had loved her time in the spotlight. ""I think they've (she and the media) exploited each other. Both have benefited. In Jade's own words, she's loved the last 7 years. They've been wonderful. All the people's she's met, all the things she's done.""

"(CNN) -- As ""The Dark Knight's"" crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent vigorously tries to combat Gotham City's crime spree, he quotes the old saying: ""The night is always darkest before the dawn."" The late Heath Ledger plays the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" a performance already garnering raves. But the dawn may have been the brightest time for ""The Dark Knight,"" which was scheduled to have about 3,000 late-night showings, including almost 100 showings at 3 and 6 a.m. Friday, according to Fandango.com spokesman Harry Medved. Medved said he couldn't remember the last time there were more than two or three such showings in the middle of the night -- usually in New York or Los Angeles. ""Isn't that when people are just thinking about waking up and going to Starbucks?"" Medved asked. ""I predict coffee sales will increase tomorrow."" With the film's running time of two and a half hours, Medved is declaring ""The Dark Knight's"" opening day Dark Friday, predicting that attendance at work could be dramatically down. During a survey given to people who buy tickets through Fandango.com, 38 percent of those who are working said they would be taking either some time or the day off to see the movie. According to MovieTickets.com, ""Dark Knight"" sold out more than 150 performances in Los Angeles and New York alone. The midnight show times were not just for major movie centers, either. Medved said cities such as Fresno, California; Orlando, Florida; and towns in Minnesota are hosting early-morning showings. Enthusiasts showed up in groups, some dressed head to toe in costume to celebrate the movie's release. The midnight showing at the 428-seat Henry Ford IMAX theater in Detroit sold out in less than a week, according to the Detroit Free Press. One group attending the showing, which was preceded by a costume party, showed up with a homemade version of the Batmobile and outfits representing nearly every major Batman character. The film also opened Thursday in Australia and Wednesday in Taiwan. It will be released in Japan on August 9. See when the film is opening around the world . ""The Dark Knight"" has risen to second place on Fandango.com's all-time list of advance tickets sales, second only to ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith."" ""The Dark Knight"" tickets represent 94 percent of Fandango's sales, Medved said. Interest is high at IMAX theaters, too, especially because six film sequences were shot with IMAX cameras. And it's not just the movie business that were looking to cash in on the blockbuster. Corporate America hopes to capitalize on the hype, too, with Dominos offering a Gotham City pizza and Comcast showing behind-the-scenes movie footage and interviews with the cast and filmmakers via its On Demand service. As fans left the midnight screenings, the hype surrounding the movie has only continued to build. The film is even earning Oscar buzz, thanks to the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Moviegoers purchasing tickets on Fandango echoed those sentiments, with 53 percent saying his performance was their main motivation for seeing the film. Ledger's performance has been hailed as ""indelible"" (Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan), ""powerful"" (The Washington Post's Stephen Hunter, in an overall mixed review) and ""mesmerizing"" (CNN.com's Tom Charity); clips of his character have dominated the movie's marketing campaign.  See how Ledger made the joker his own » . His absence was conspicuous Monday at the New York premiere, his co-stars noted. ""He should be here, shouldn't he? Because this is his big moment; because he is the most amazing thing in the picture,"" said Michael Caine, who plays Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred. ""And it's not because he's dead or something and everyone's concentrating on him. He would have been the most amazing thing in the picture anyway."" Caine also praised the late actor's commitment to immersing himself in a character, something he says is evident from Ledger's opening monologue. ""It's one of the finest close-ups I've ever seen,"" Caine said. Other members of the cast praised Ledger for redefining the character brought to life in the past by Mark Hamill (""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker"") and Jack Nicholson (""Batman"").  See members of the cast praise Ledger » . Aaron Eckhart, who plays District Attorney Harvey Dent, said it was tragic that Ledger wasn't around to celebrate his achievement. ""It's hard to talk about; this is his. He created the Joker,"" Eckhart said. ""He did it in his own way, and it's sad, but on the other hand, I am proud to be able to honor him tonight."" Director Christopher Nolan also praised the rest of the cast, including Christian Bale as Batman, Gary Oldman as police Lt. Jim Gordon, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes and Morgan Freeman as tech wizard Lucius Fox. Nolan, who directed ""Batman Begins"" three years ago, said he was glad he was able to take a step back and opt for a different approach.  See the cast on the ""black carpet"" » . ""I think we've tried to expand the scope of the story, to tell a grander, more epic tale,"" he told CNN. ""We've tried to really take the character and take it to darker territory by introducing it to the Joker."" Nolan seems to have made believers even out of those who were not die-hard fans of the Batman series, including Gyllenhaal, who said she was ""never a superhero movie kind of girl."" ""I watched a Batman here, a Batman there, but this is different,"" she said. ""Chris [Nolan] wanted us to play everything for truth. It's about real people in the midst of this wild crazy Batman world. And I became a Batman fan shooting it. I mean, have Batman sweep you up and save you from certain death. It converts a girl, you know?"" The movie was expected to be shown on a record-breaking 9,200 screens in its opening, according to its studio, Warner Bros. (Like CNN, Warner Bros. is a division of Time Warner.) Hollywood columnist Nikki Finke said that insiders at the studio are being conservative, predicting a weekend opening of between $90 million and $100 million -- strong but not record-breaking. But box office experts, according to Finke, are saying the movie could make as much as $130 million, which would make it a narrow third for best opening weekend, behind ""Spider-Man 3"" ($151 million) and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" ($136 million). Regardless of how much money the movie grosses, by far the biggest anticipation may be whether the Academy Awards agree with those -- including Oldman -- who say Ledger should earn an Oscar. ""I just wish that he was here to talk about his performance,"" he said. ""I really feel that there is at least an Oscar nomination, if not a win for him. He really is that good.""

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted four people in the shooting death of a woman during what police say was a Ku Klux Klan initiation rite in the Louisiana woods, St. Tammany Parish prosecutors said. Raymond ""Chuck"" Foster is reputed to be the leader of the Klan Group. He was among the four indicted. Raymond ""Chuck"" Foster, 44, was indicted on second-degree murder charges Wednesday in the November death of Cynthia Lynch, 43, of Tulsa, Oklahoma. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, said Rick Wood, spokesman for the St. Tammany Parish district attorney's office. ""That's what he was charged with,"" Wood told reporters on Wednesday. ""The grand jury agreed with that charge."" Two other men, including Foster's son, Shane Foster, were indicted on a count of obstruction of justice, and a woman, Danielle Jones, was indicted on one count of being an accessory after the fact. Wood said Thursday Foster's case was assigned to one judge and the others' cases were assigned to another. Foster is scheduled to be arraigned March 3, he said, and the others are set for arraignment next week. Eight people initially were arrested in the case. The remaining four were not indicted. ""Haven't seen one like this,"" Wood said Wednesday. ""We've had a lot of high-profile cases, but not one like this. ... As (district attorney) Walter Reed said, it will be to the max. They will be prosecuted to the max."" Authorities said Lynch was recruited over the Internet and took a bus to Slidell, Louisiana, where she was met by two Klan members. They then went to a campsite in the woods near Sun, Louisiana, about 60 miles north of New Orleans, where they met other members of the group, police said. During the initiation rite, members of the Klan group, which calls itself the Sons of Dixie, shaved Lynch's head, according to Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Jack Strain, who spoke to CNN in November. After 24 hours of drills, including chanting and running with torches, she asked to be taken to town. An argument began, authorities said, and the group's leader, Raymond Foster, pushed Lynch to the ground and shot her without warning. Lynch apparently wanted to leave because she was homesick, investigators found after talking to her family members. After the shooting, ""Foster, we believe, removed a knife from his pocket and rolled over the victim and began a process of trying to remove the bullet from her body ... because he was trying to destroy evidence where law enforcement would not be able to piece these things together,"" Strain said. Police believe other members of the Sons of Dixie helped cover up the slaying on Foster's behalf, Strain said at the time, including burning some of Lynch's personal items. ""We're up to the challenge,"" Wood told reporters after the indictments were handed up Wednesday. ""This office is ready to proceed and take care of business."" Authorities received the initial tip about the slaying from a convenience store clerk, after two group members went into the store and asked him if he knew how to get bloodstains out of their clothes. The clerk told them he did not, then called police after they left. Officials tracked down those two members and arrested them, then arrested others at the campsite and Foster. All the members surrendered without incident, police said. Investigators found Confederate battle flags, Ku Klux Klan banners, five Klan robes and an Imperial Wizard robe at the campsite, authorities said. Lynch's body was found under loose brush along a road several miles from the campsite. Raymond Foster has a history of Ku Klux Klan activity dating back seven years, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a Montgomery, Alabama-based organization that tracks hate groups.","Police say Cynthia Lynch of Tulsa shot as she tried to leave KKK rite .

"(CNN) -- Ricin, a poison thought to have been found in a Las Vegas, Nevada, hotel room Thursday, can be made from the waste left after processing castor beans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ricin is made from castor beans. The toxin comes in the form of a mist or pellet and can be dissolved in water or weak acid, according to the CDC. It works by getting inside the cells of the body and preventing them from making the proteins they need. As little as 500 micrograms -- an amount the size of the head of a pin -- can kill an adult. Here are some ricin cases: . • September 1978, London, England: Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov is killed by a ricin-filled poison dart fired from an umbrella. Markov, a communist defector working for the BBC World Service, was waiting at a bus stop when he was killed. • 2002, Iraq: A primitive testing facility run by members of Ansar al Islam, a Kurdish Sunni Islamist group, is discovered. Authorities say ricin had been tested on barnyard animals there. • January 2003, United Kingdom: Scotland Yard arrests seven terror suspects from Algeria after traces of ricin are discovered at their homes. A U.S. official later connects the men to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who led al Qaeda in Iraq until his death in 2006. Four of the men were charged with terrorism offenses under Britain's Terrorist Act 2000 and with ""being concerned in the development or production of chemical weapons"" under the Chemical Weapons Act of 1996. • March 2003, France: Small bottles containing traces of ricin are found in a Paris train station, according to French police. • October 2003, United States: Ricin is found in a sealed envelope in a postal handling facility in Greenville, South Carolina.

"(CNN) -- The White House insists that it was entirely former Sen. Tom Daschle's decision to withdraw his nomination, but some observers say he didn't have a choice. Tom Daschle said Tuesday that he's stepping aside as the nominee for secretary of health and human services. Despite the controversy over his tax records and his work in a field that some consider lobbying, Daschle was expected to be confirmed. His withdrawal shocked Capitol Hill, and Democratic colleagues expressed regret over his decision. ""I think one of the major factors had to be that the political climate has changed radically just in the last couple of weeks,"" CNN Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry said. President Obama ripped Wall Street executives last week for their ""shameful"" decision to hand out $18 billion in bonuses in 2008 while accepting federal bailout money. The next day, news broke that Daschle hadn't paid his taxes in full. Daschle said Monday that he was ""deeply embarrassed"" for a series of errors that included failing to report $15,000 in charitable donations, unreported car service and more than $80,000 in unreported income from consulting. Daschle recently filed amended tax returns and paid more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest for 2005-07. ""That, in this political climate, really tripped up Tom Daschle because it looked awful politically for this White House,"" Henry said. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday, Obama said he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Daschle. ""I think I screwed up. And, I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again. ""Ultimately, I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom-up politics,"" Obama said. ""And I don't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes."" At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, press secretary Robert Gibbs insisted that the White House did not pressure Daschle to step down.  Watch Gibbs answer questions about Daschle's move » . Pressed on whether Daschle was given any sort of signal to resign, Gibbs said, ""I don't know how much more clear I could be. The decision was Sen. Daschle's."" A Daschle ally familiar with his thinking said Tuesday that he was not aware of any White House pressure on the former Senate majority leader to withdraw his nomination. Asked whether Daschle was pushed, the source said, ""things don't work that cleanly."" The issue was not whether Daschle could ""survive""; it was what that process ""would do to Obama"" and his health care reform and economic agenda. It's a question of the ""price of that confirmation,"" he said. The source said Daschle read the Tuesday New York Times editorial urging him to withdraw from consideration but would not say whether that might have played a part in his decision. ""Tom has been a politician for a very long time,"" the source said. ""He understands this town. He made a mistake; he apologized, but timing matters. There was a critical mass building."" Obama senior adviser David Axelrod said he thought Daschle made the decision Tuesday morning. ""I have to believe that Sen. Daschle having spent as many years as he has up here had a clear picture that there was going to be a delay, and I think he didn't want to contribute to that. In announcing his withdrawal, Daschle said it was an honor to be chosen to lead the reform of America's health care system. ""But if 30 years of exposure to the challenges inherent in our system has taught me anything, it has taught me that this work will require a leader who can operate with the full faith of Congress and the American people, and without distraction,"" he said in a statement. ""Right now, I am not that leader and will not be a distraction."" Mark Preston, CNN's political editor, pointed out that Daschle has a ""history of making 11th-hour decisions."" Six years ago, Daschle made a last-minute decision not to run for president after he had been all set to go. ""I think that the Tom Daschle we saw yesterday was all set to go, and then the pressure started mounting ... and then he decided to pull out,"" Preston said. Although he was expected to be confirmed, it was also expected that he'd have to undergo a bruising confirmation hearing that could have led to negative headlines for Obama. As news broke of the withdrawal, some senators said they were sad to see Daschle step aside, but others said it was the right thing to do. ""I'm in shock. I didn't know that. I don't know what happened,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. ""I talked to him ... the night before last, and he showed no signs of withdrawing."" Feinstein praised Daschle as rare person who could get something like health care through the Senate and said she wishes he had not withdrawn. ""I have great faith in him."" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Daschle ""did a service to President Obama"" by stepping aside. ""I think it really would have looked bad for the Senate to close ranks around a fellow member and sort of reinforce the idea that they were going to protect a member as part of the good ol' boys club,"" he said. Daschle has a lengthy history with members of Congress. He represented South Dakota in the House of Representatives for four terms, and he served in the Senate for three terms. He was the Senate majority leader from June 2001 to January 2003 and served as the minority leader before losing his re-election bid in 2005. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nevada, said Daschle ""saved the president from being embarrassed"" by withdrawing.  Watch Republicans weigh in on the move » . Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he was ""a little stunned"" by Daschle's decision. ""I thought he was going to get confirmed. I thought -- he's a good man, and I thought he'd be confirmed. I'm surprised,"" said Baucus, D-Montana. Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, insisted that Daschle had owned up to his mistakes. ""He's made his decision, I respect his decision, and we go on from there,"" Kerry said. Daschle's resignation came hours after Nancy Killefer's withdrawal as Obama's chief performance officer, a new post in the administration. Officials said privately the reason for Killefer's withdrawal was unspecified tax issues. The much-touted post was designed to scrub the federal budget.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- The clicking of dozens of news cameras drowned out the sobs of the 13-year-old girl, but her face explained what was happening in the departure hall of Japan's Narita International Airport. Arlan and Sarah Calderon hug their daughter Noriko farewell. Noriko Calderon, wearing her school uniform, was being forced to make one of the most wrenching choices of her young life: To stay in the country of her birth rather than join her parents being deported to the Philippines. The scene was the emotional climax to a story a decade and a half in the making -- one that has tugged at heartstrings in Japan, but ultimately failed to sway to an unyielding bureaucracy that activists say violates human rights. Sound off: Do you think Japanese authorities are doing the right thing? Filipinos Arlan and Sarah Calderon illegally entered Japan in the early 1990s on fake passports. They married and had a daughter, Noriko. Arlan found a stable job working for a construction company. Noriko grew up Japanese, attending school and never learning her parents' native language. Noriko, like many Tokyo girls her age, loves hip-hop and hopes to be a dancer or a teacher at a dance school someday. But her future in the only country she's ever known went into limbo when Japanese immigration authorities arrested her mother in 2006. Her parents decided to fight Japan's notoriously rigid immigration laws and for three years under a harsh media spotlight, they argued their case all the way to the country's High Court, saying Arlan is gainfully employed and their daughter only speaks Japanese. The family lost their case in the High Court, and Japan ordered Arlan and Sarah Calderon be deported back to the Philippines.  Watch CNN interview with family » . Activists claim Japan's notoriously rigid immigration laws violate human rights. An estimated 500 families are in the same situation according to lawyers, who accuse Japan of not respecting the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Japan's Immigration Bureau in a statement to CNN said the couple's illegal presence in the country as an ""extremely malicious"" violation that ""shakes the foundation of Japan's immigration control."" But when it came to 13 year old Noriko, the government gave the girl a choice: Her country or her parents. ""Japan is my homeland,"" says Noriko, when asked why she is choosing to stay behind. She will move in with an aunt, allowed to stay in Japan under a visa that the government will reassess yearly. Her life, say her parents, will be better in Japan. She'll have schooling and the dreams a big city like Tokyo can offer her, versus the impoverished farm community her parents will move back to in the Philippines. But as the Calderons packed up their small apartment in the days leading up to the deportation, the reality of what would soon happen to the family became more and more harsh. ""Until I'm an adult, I need my parents,"" Noriko said, her pink cheeks stained with tears. ""We won't be there when she needs us the most,"" said Arlan Calderon. ""She has to protect herself on her own. I'm so sorry about that."" Shogo Watanabe, the Calderons' attorney, collected more than 20,000 signatures in Japan to try and keep the family together in the country. ""Children should be protected when their parents are punished. It's the child's right. But there's no consideration for that at all. I do not think the government is being flexible,"" said Watanabe. Under Japanese immigration laws, the Calderons won't be allowed back into Japan for five years. They've asked for a special waiver to visit their daughter after a year, but it hasn't been granted yet. So their last, public hug could be the last time they see their daughter until she's 18.","Noriko Calderon born and raised in Japan by Filipino parents .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles police have launched an internal investigation to determine who leaked a picture that appears to show a bruised and battered Rihanna. Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8. The close-up photo -- showing a woman with contusions on her forehead and below her eyes, and cuts on her lip -- was published on the entertainment Web site TMZ Thursday. TMZ said it was a photo of Rihanna. Twenty-one-year-old Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, on a Los Angeles street before the two were to perform at the Grammys on February 8. ""The unauthorized release of a domestic violence photograph immediately generated an internal investigation,"" an L.A. police spokesman said in a statement. ""The Los Angeles Police Department takes seriously its duty to maintain the confidentiality of victims of domestic violence. A violation of this type is considered serious misconduct, with penalties up to and including termination."" A spokeswoman for Rihanna declined to comment. The chief investigator in the case had told CNN earlier that authorities had tried to guard against leaks. Detective Deshon Andrews said he had kept the case file closely guarded and that no copies had been made of the original photos and documents. Brown was arrested on February 8 in connection with the case and and booked on suspicion of making criminal threats. Authorities are trying to determine whether Brown should face domestic violence-related charges. Brown apologized for the incident this week. ""Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired,"" the 19-year-old said in a statement released by his spokesman. ""I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person.""

"Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. Paul Begala says Republicans are failing to respond to the real economic pain felt throughout the U.S. (CNN) -- As the fight over President Obama's economic recovery package heats up, the two sides are beginning to define themselves with admirable clarity. The president says we have a crisis that is heading toward a catastrophe. In announcing his new Economic Recovery Advisory Board, President Obama declared, ""The situation could not be more serious. These [new unemployment] numbers demand action. It is inexcusable and irresponsible for any of us to get bogged down in distraction, delay, or politics as usual, while millions of Americans are being put out of work."" The Republicans, on the other hand, have honed their economic message: Denial, Delay, Do Nothing. Denial . It begins with denial. Former Bush adviser Karl Rove and Fox News host Bill O'Reilly opined in December that it's the media's fault. The said the press is overhyping bad news; the economy, they suggested, is not really all that bad. ""So you are agreeing with me,"" O'Reilly said, ""that there is a conscious effort on the part of The New York Times and other liberal media to basically paint as drastic a picture as possible, so that when Barack Obama takes office, that anything is better than what we have now?"" ""Yes,"" said Mr. Rove. OK. I guess if you're wealthy like Mr. Rove and Mr. O'Reilly you can afford to pretend the recession is a vast media conspiracy. But for the 3.7 million Americans who have lost their jobs in the Bush-Republican recession, Messrs. Rove and O'Reilly seem dangerously out of touch. Delay . ""Let's slow down. Let's take our time,"" said Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Nebraska). ""Few things are going to be as important as this."" Generally that's good advice. But with the economy losing 19,000 jobs a day, is delay really a wise strategy? Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Alabama) seems to think so. He told CNN's John King, ""We could shelf this bill and start again. That's what we really need to do."" Do Nothing . South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford is widely considered a rising star in the GOP. He was even mentioned as a potential running mate for 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain. His strategy, again articulated to John King on ""State of the Union,"" is to do nothing -- let companies, communities and families fail. ""We're going to go through a process of deleveraging,"" Sanford said. ""And it will be painful. The question is, do we apply a bunch of different Band-Aids that lengthen and prolong this pain or do we take the Band-Aid off? I believe very strongly: Let's get this thing over with, let's not drag it on."" Set aside the callousness of Sanford's metaphor -- that joblessness at the highest level since the Great Depression is somehow like a scratch that doesn't even need a Band-Aid. Focus instead on Sanford's substantive message: You're on your own. Write if you get work. This befits a party which has high-ranking members who deny the effectiveness of the New Deal. What's next, denying that the federal government put a man on the moon? What Bipartisanship? Given the GOP's combination of flat-earth economics and scorched-earth politics, it should come as no surprise that it looks like 98.6 percent of Washington Republicans oppose President Obama's economic recovery package. They either do not understand the depth of the recession or they do not realize the results of the recent election. I don't know what more President Obama can do. He has named three prominent Republicans to his Cabinet (Robert Gates at Defense, Ray LaHood at Transportation and Judd Gregg at Commerce). He has helped persuade New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch to replace Sen. Gregg with a Republican. He has met behind closed doors with the entire House and Senate Republican conferences. He has hosted bipartisan cocktail parties, a Super Bowl party and -- what's left, a slumber party? He has agreed to ditch progressive provisions from the stimulus bill, like support for family planning (earning him a rebuke from Planned Parenthood) and accepted more tax cuts than many Democrats would like. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on the stimulus package . Still, there's bipartisanship and there's bipartisanship. Real-world Republicans support President Obama's recovery plan. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is a supporter, and as the ubiquitous John King has reported, the very Republican mayor of the very Republican town of Carmel, Indiana, supports Obama's plan as well. ""Government should be investing in infrastructure,"" Mayor James Brainard told King. ""That is what government is meant to do. It creates long-term value. I think the stimulus plan is a good one."" So take heart, Mr. President. In the real world of layoffs, foreclosures and plant closings, you have the support of both Republicans and Democrats. They agree with you that Denial, Delay and Doing Nothing is not an economic strategy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Paul Begala: Republicans are adopting strategy of blocking action on economy .

"(CNN) -- The man accused in the brutal killing of Arkansas television anchor Anne Pressly will appear next Thursday in Pulaski County Circuit Court, where he will enter a plea in the high-profile case. Anne Pressly, 26, was a news anchor at KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Curtis Lavell Vance, 28, was formally charged Thursday with capital murder, rape, residential burglary and theft, Prosecutor Larry Jegley said Friday. Neither he nor police would discuss details of the case because of a gag order imposed by the judge. Jegley hasn't said whether he will seek the death penalty. Jegley said Vance, who denies he was in Little Rock, Arkansas, when Pressly was killed, was being held at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. Vance was linked to the killing through DNA testing. Lt. Terry Hastings, spokesman for Little Rock police, told CNN in December that investigators are ""110 percent"" certain Vance killed Pressly, 26, who was the morning news anchor for KATV, a CNN affiliate. Pressly was found unconscious in her home October 20 and died five days later at a hospital. ""She fought for her life. She fought her attacker. Her left hand was broken from trying to fight this man off,"" Pressly's mother, Patti Cannady, told NBC. ""Six weeks ago this morning, I found my daughter beyond recognition with every bone in her face broken, her nose broken, her jaw pulverized so badly that the bone had come out of it; I actually thought that her throat had possibly been cut. Her entire skull had numerous fractures from which she suffered a massive stroke."" Hastings told CNN that DNA evidence also ties Vance to a rape in April in Marianna, Arkansas, about 90 miles east of Little Rock. The affidavit related to the Pressly case, from Little Rock detective Tommy Hudson, said police made contact with Vance at his home in Marianna. Hastings said investigators have found no link between Pressly and Vance, and they do not believe Pressly's being on TV had anything to do with the killing. ""I think he saw her someplace, probably followed her home with intention of robbing her. And then went from there."" The killer also took Pressly's purse, Hastings said.","Curtis Lavell Vance, 28, has been charged with capital murder, rape, burglary, theft .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A warning of more attacks on UK bankers was made on Wednesday after the home of former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin was vandalized. A recovery vehicle removes a Mercedes from the Edinburgh home of Fred Goodwin. Windows were smashed in Goodwin's house in the Scottish capital Edinburgh and those of a Mercedes-Benz limousine parked outside. It is not known if anyone was at home at the time. Goodwin -- dubbed ""Fred the Shred"" by the media for his ruthless cost-cutting -- and his family have not been living in the house since it was revealed that the 50-year-old Goodwin was receiving an annual pension of $1 million (£700,000) for life. A statement issued to media organizations including the Press Association after the attack said: ""We are angry that rich people, like him, are paying themselves a huge amount of money and living in luxury, while ordinary people are made unemployed, destitute and homeless. ""Bank bosses should be jailed. This is just the beginning."" No group was named in the message and it did not explicitly claim responsibility for the attack. Goodwin took early retirement after RBS nearly collapsed amid the economic crisis and was later part-nationalized.  Watch more on the attack » . On the same day as the size of his pension was revealed RBS announced a UK record loss of $34.6 billion (£24.1 billion) for 2008. Politicians and commentators have expressed fury about the deal and excessive bonuses being given by bailed-out banks. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling, head of the Treasury, urged Goodwin to give up his pension. He refused, saying he had already given up a number of contractual rights which had cost him a lot of money.  Watch consternation at Goodwin's £16 million pension fund » . The statement warning of more attacks on bankers came days after AIG sent a memo to employees giving them security advice as fury grows in the U.S. over millions paid out in bonuses by the bailed-out U.S. insurance giant. Employees were warned not to wear the company logo, to travel in pairs and park in well-lit places, and to phone security if they notice anyone ""spending an inordinate amount of time near an AIG facility."" AIG employees have received death threats since the company handed out $165 million (£115 million) in bonuses and security at AIG offices has been increased. And last month British police warned that officers were preparing for a ""summer of rage"" as protests mount across Europe against the economic crisis.

"BRADDOCK, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- What happens when business and government turn their collective back on a town and just walk away? Braddock, Pennsylvania, is what happens. Braddock, Pennsylvania, has suffered since the steel mills went out of business in the 1970s and 1980s. When steel was king, the population of Braddock surged to more than 20,000 people. With its proximity to Pittsburgh and its location on the Monongahela River, it was an ideal location for a steel town. When steel mills began closing in the 1970s and 1980s, Braddock was not immune. In 1982, Braddock's main mill, the Carrie Furnace, closed its doors, putting thousands of people out of work. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, residents left the town seeking work in other parts of Pennsylvania. The 2000 census put the population of Braddock at 2,900, but it has dropped further, according to residents. Home prices have plummeted and real estate is as inexpensive as $6,000 for a single-family house. Historic pictures show a polished downtown and a bustling community. Now, most businesses have closed their doors, leaving only a handful to serve the community. A drive down Braddock Avenue, the main street, indicates the town has seen the bottom. The avenue is lined with crumbling offices and stores, boarded windows and empty lots where buildings once stood. But there is hope in the town. In 2005, Braddock elected John Fetterman by one vote as its mayor. He is originally from York, Pennsylvania, and has lived in the area of Braddock for eight years. He has an MBA from Harvard and started a  program that helped dislocated youth from the area receive their high school equivalency degrees. At 6 feet 8 inches and 325 pounds, he is an imposing figure. He chooses to dress in Dr Martens boots, baggy jeans and Dickies short-sleeved shirts because he feels he is able to connect with the people better dressed that way. He shaves his head and has a goatee. Possibly the most intimidating aspects of Fetterman's appearance are his tattoos, clearly visible on his forearms, including the numbers 15104, the town's ZIP code.  Watch as the mayor talks about his revitalization plan » . When asked if he thinks the town is at rock bottom, Fetterman replies, ""I don't believe that it's the bottom in the sense that this is a bad place. This is what can happen when you turn your back on a community."" Since he was elected, Fetterman has made it his mission to give Braddock a prosperous future. He has given incentives to businesses to relocate to his town. The main incentive is large manufacturing space at a fraction of the cost in a normal market. A company that converts diesel engines into vegetable-oil burning engines, Fossil Free Fuel, relocated to Braddock from Allen, Pennsylvania. ""The initial building was about 14,000 square feet and supposedly the asking price was $25,000. And we were like how do you get so much space for so little money?"" said David Rosenstraus, one of the owners of Fossil Free Fuel. ""I think for a very small business like us, not having very much capital to work with building a shop, and investments going into tools and things inside the shop, [we] would be spread thin if we had to pay a lot for the actual building."" On the site where the Carrie Furnace steel mill building still stands, the county plans to convert the contaminated land into commercial and residential space. Allegheny County executive Dan Onorato is driving this plan, ""We don't look at this like a liability. We see some potential here. We can take back 147 acres, take back the riverfront and make this a viable spot again. But you have to invest public money into the infrastructure to make that happen. It won't happen on its own. For example, this place closed 25 years ago, it's still here. The public sector has to come in and invest."" Braddock still has many obstacles to overcome, but Fetterman believes that it's possible to grow, ""I'd like to see Braddock move towards -- continue to move towards -- a safer place that is moving towards better outcomes for everybody.""","Braddock, Pennsylvania, thrived as a steel town .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai of Zimbabwe said Monday that he does not believe foul play was involved in a car wreck that killed his wife. The vehicle the couple were traveling in was left overturned off the highway. ""When something like that happens there is speculation, but I want to assure you if it was foul play, it is one in a thousand,"" he said Monday. ""It was an accident that took her life."" Tsvangirai's comments came amid widespread speculation that the wreck was caused by his political opponents aligned with President Robert Mugabe. Tsvangirai's political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, has said the crash was an assassination attempt. It has called for an independent inquiry. Zimbabwe's new prime minister was hurt in the wreck and returned home Monday from neighboring Botswana. ""Life has to go on and I'm certain that if she was here she would liked life to go on,"" he said. ""It will be difficult to fill the gap left by her."" Tsvangirai has long been a leading opposition figure in Zimbabwe, but he joined a coalition government with Mugabe last month. That seemed to resolve an impasse created by a disputed presidential election between Mugabe and Tsvangirai last year. Tsvangirai received the most votes in the March 2008 election, but he fell short of the 50 percent required to avoid a runoff. He withdrew as a candidate in the runoff, citing political violence and intimidation targeting his supporters. Negotiations between the two sides culminated in the power-sharing agreement that was implemented just weeks ago. Questions about the wreck surfaced shortly after it happened Friday on a busy two-lane highway between Tsvangirai's hometown of Buhera and the capital city of Harare. On Saturday, members of Tsvangirai's political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, told CNN that Tsvangirai believed that the driver of the truck that struck his car deliberately drove toward him in an effort to take his life. The party's secretary-general, Tendai Biti, said police should have provided better security for Tsvangirai. The wreck might not have happened, he said, if a police escort been on hand. A former U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe, Tom McDonald, said the wreck raised suspicion. ""I'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure,"" said McDonald, who was ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001. ""President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone, lo and behold, dies -- it's sort of his M.O. of how they get rid of people they don't like."" McDonald, however, was quick to add that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe. The highway on which Tsvangirai was traveling is a two-lane road on which tractor-trailers are common, he said. Vehicles in the country are often in bad shape and many drivers are inexperienced, he said. ""It's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things,"" he said. -- CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report.","Tsvangirai: ""It was an accident that took her life""

"(CNN) -- Tim Masters squarely blames Fort Collins, Colorado, police and prosecutors for his inability to land gainful employment and for his not having a wife and kids at this stage in his life. Tim Masters, left, stands with attorney David Wymore, right, before Masters' release from prison last year. In 1987, Masters became the prime suspect in the slaying of Peggy Hettrick, a 37-year-old found in a field near his house. Among the reasons police said they focused on Masters was that he failed to report the body after he found it and his childhood drawings and stories suggested he was fixated on death. Masters was convicted of murder in 1999, but a judge last year threw out the conviction and released him from prison, citing new evidence that did not implicate Masters. Masters now has a lawsuit pending against several police officers, ex-prosecutors and the city. The city of Fort Collins has asked a federal judge to dismiss the case. Now 37, Masters sat down for a phone interview with a CNN reporter who covered his case and subsequent release. He said he still holds a grudge against the police and prosecutors who put him behind bars.  Watch Masters the day after his 2008 release » . He's living in Greeley, Colorado, and doesn't get back to Fort Collins much, but he does love traveling. Most notably, he's traveled to Amsterdam, Netherlands, to appear on a talk show with Richard and Selma Eikelenboom, the Dutch forensic scientists who discovered the DNA evidence that ultimately freed Masters. Things can be tough sometimes, but anything is better than prison, Masters said of his first year as a free man since being imprisoned. CNN: How have things been in the year since your release? Masters: It's a struggle to earn enough money to pay my bills and everything, make a living. Other than that, life is good. CNN: Do you have a job? Masters: I buy stuff at auction and I sell it on eBay. CNN: Do you have trouble finding a job because of your time in jail? Masters: Yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it. The first thing that comes up on a background check is ""charges dismissed -- first-degree murder.""  Watch Masters thank those last year who worked to free him » . CNN: How else have you been keeping yourself busy? Masters: Pretty much work. That's it. CNN: Describe a typical day. Masters: The big challenge is, first of all, you've got to find out where the auctions are. Once you get that down, then you go to the auctions. Another disadvantage I have is I'm a little outdated on the prices of things, so I'm thinking things are worth a lot less than what they're going for. So I have to learn what things are worth now. I go to the auction, and I bid on stuff. I try and buy it cheap enough that I can make a profit on it, load it into the truck, bring it back to the house. I have shelves all in my basement full of just odds and ends. I put it all on the shelves. I do research on the computer and find out which ones I can actually make a profit on, and I list those. You list the item on eBay and let it run its course through the auction for usually seven days. If it sells, you pack it and ship it off. If it doesn't sell, you can either re-list it as an auction item, re-list it as a store item or throw it in the trash. CNN: What kind of money do you make in a typical week? Masters: Not enough. CNN: What do you enjoy doing most that you weren't able to do in prison? Masters: Travel. I've been to see my sister about four times since I've been out. She's in California. I have an uncle in Arizona. This goes along with the eBay business. I go down there every once in a while. He has a warehouse full of used restaurant equipment, and I go down there every so often. I go through his warehouse, take pictures of all the new stuff he's got in and I list it on eBay for him. Sometimes it sells, sometimes it doesn't. In April, a TV station over in Amsterdam paid to fly me over there to be on a talk show with Richard and Selma [Eikelenboom] from the DNA lab. That was cool.  Watch a prosecutor explain why Masters' conviction was reversed » . CNN: What did you have the hardest time getting used to after being in prison so long? Masters: Maybe cell phones? Cell phones are everywhere now. They didn't used to be so common. I had a cell phone before I was arrested, but the last year before I was arrested, I didn't even keep service on it. Now, I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have a cell phone. It has my calendar, my address book, everything on it.

On the other side of the street, they had the yellow police tape up, and this is only two blocks from my aunt's house. I'm thinking, ""Oh great, I wonder when they're going to come interrogate me for something that happened over here."" It turns out the yellow tape was up because there was a telephone pole that was leaning over, but it looked like crime scene tape. I didn't know. But I can't live like that, wondering when they are going to harass me for something that I didn't have anything to do with. They did it to me before. CNN: So you're keeping a low profile?

"(CNN) -- A missing 5-year-old Florida girl was most likely abducted from her home in rural Florida, police said Wednesday. Haleigh Cummings, 5, went missing Monday night from her home near Orlando, police said. Haleigh Cummings has been missing since 3 a.m. Tuesday, when her father's girlfriend called 911 to say the child had vanished from her Putnam County home. ""There's no longer any reason to believe that the child simply wandered outside,"" said Putnam County Sheriff's Office Maj. Gary Bowling. The police must ""assume abduction,"" he said. ""All the answers to why you'd want to take a 5-year-old are ugly,"" Bowling said. Police have no official suspects, but are treating everyone they interview as one. ""All the world's a suspect"" now, Bowling said.   Hear the frantic 911 call » . A nationwide Amber Alert says the girl was last seen wearing a pink shirt and underwear. Police plan to use infrared aviation technology after dark Wednesday in their search. ""She's a 5-year-old child, and she's afraid of the dark,"" Bowling said. On Monday night, Ronald Cummings' girlfriend, 17-year-old Misty Croslin, was watching Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother, police said. Croslin put Haleigh to bed at 8 p.m. and then went to bed herself at 10 p.m., they said.  Croslin told police she woke up at 3 a.m. and discovered Haleigh missing. Croslin then called 911 and told a dispatcher that she found a brick on the floor of the family's double-wide trailer, according to CNN affiliate WJXT-TV. The station's Web site printed the text of the 911 call, which included this exchange: . Dispatch: OK. All right, you said your back door was wide open? Caller: Yes, with a brick. Like, there was a brick on the floor. Like, when I went to sleep the door was not like that. The brick was actually holding open the door to the trailer, Putnam County Sheriff's Office Lt. Johnny Greenwood told CNN. Croslin is staying with relatives as the investigation continues, said Bowling, describing the girlfriend as a ""child herself."" Earlier Wednesday, Cummings pleaded for his daughter's safe return. ""All I want is my child ... please ... all I want is my child,"" he said, his voice breaking. On Wednesday, Haleigh's maternal grandmother, Marie Griffis, told reporters that she feared the worst. ""She's out there somewhere, I can feel her. I can feel her presence,"" Griffis told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV. ""She's screaming.""  Watch grandparents plead for girl's return » .

Watch mother's tearful plea » . Griffis said that her daughter and Ronald Cummings had a ""rocky relationship"" and that the two took turns spending weekends with their daughter. Sheffield lives near the Florida-Georgia line and has been interviewed by law enforcement, according to police. Investigators are looking into various angles of the case, including finding out the location of 44 registered sexual offenders who live within a five-mile radius of the Cummings home, Greenwood said. Though that number may sound high, it includes both Putnam and Palatka counties, which are separated by the St. Johns River, the law enforcement spokesman told CNN. Police are offering but not requiring all those interviewed in the case to take polygraph tests.

"Harold Holzer, co-chairman of the U. S. Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, is the author of the new book, ""Lincoln President-Elect: Abraham Lincoln and the Great Secession Winter 1860-1861"" and author, co-author or editor of 32 other books. Harold Holzer says Obama represents validation of Lincoln's hope of equal opportunity for all. NEW YORK (CNN) -- They are big shoes to fill by any standard, political or historical. Pointing to his oversize, specially made boots, Abraham Lincoln once confided that he may have been slow to put his foot down, but once he did, he never went back. That's a lesson worth learning for any president-elect. And few incoming chief executives have been as conscious of the 16th president as the 44th: Barack Obama. The new president-elect wrote about Lincoln in his acclaimed books. He not only chose to announce his candidacy for the presidency on Lincoln's birthday, in 2006, but did so outside the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, where Lincoln delivered his famous ""House Divided"" speech in 1858 and where he had his headquarters as president-elect. The myriad comparisons between the two skinny, big-eared Illinoisans -- Obama's own fond description -- are already entering the realm of modern legend. Both were believed too inexperienced to be president. See iReporters don stovepipe hats to pay tribute to Lincoln . Both were long-shot underdogs for their party's nomination. Yet each went on not only to win, but to nominate the defeated party favorite (who happened to be a senator from New York) as secretary of state. William H. Seward was Lincoln's choice, Hillary Clinton is Obama's. But of course there are substantial differences: Lincoln got his education ""by littles,"" he once embarrassingly admitted, spending less than a year all told in primitive one-room schoolhouses. Obama was superbly educated at Columbia University and Harvard Law. One man was a Republican, the other is a Democrat. And while Barack Obama scored an impressive victory, the nation divided bitterly over Lincoln's 39 percent plurality in a four-person race, to the degree that the Electoral College validation remained in question -- much more like Bush vs. Gore -- as late as February 1861, while seven Southern states seceded rather than accept a Lincoln presidency. Yet fascinating similarities predominate. Both men wrote best-selling books (yes, Lincoln, too: he brought out a hugely popular edition of his Lincoln-Douglas debates). Both won fame through their transcendent oratory. Both got into political trouble over their church affiliations -- Lincoln for leaving his church too soon, Obama for not leaving soon enough. Both refused to take pets along to the White House, but promised to shower their small children with pets once they arrived (the Lincolns left their mangy dog Fido behind and President-elect Obama has vowed to get a dog for his girls once settled in Washington). He might have to do better. Willie and Tad Lincoln eventually obtained kittens, turkeys and ponies. And here is another fascinating side story. Both men felt the need to make one final visit -- before their life-altering presidencies -- for reunions with the women, neither one a natural mother, who helped raise them. Obama, of course, went back to Honolulu to see his gravely ill grandmother right before Election Day; Lincoln, right before Inauguration Day, visited rural Charleston, Illinois, to say goodbye to his aged stepmother -- who wound up outliving him. But most extraordinary of all, surely, is the fact that Barack Obama's victory serves to help complete the ""unfinished work"" Abraham Lincoln spoke about in his Gettysburg Address: that America fulfill its dream of equal opportunity regardless of race. Lincoln, of course, advanced black freedom and black voting rights; Obama represents the validation of those elusive aspirations. It is not difficult to understand why so many Americans see Barack Obama as the second coming -- of Abraham Lincoln, if not more. Lincoln once declared, ""We cannot escape history,"" and after years of national indifference to, or defiance of, the lessons of the past, our next president seems to love, comprehend, and use the past to illuminate the future. iReport.com: Can you speak like Lincoln? Comparisons can invite problems, too. On his triumphant election night, Obama properly noted that Lincoln faced a crisis far graver than our own, then quoted Lincoln's hope that ""while passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection."" Those words came right out of Lincoln's first inaugural address. But in fact they were written not by Lincoln himself -- rare for America's greatest writer-president -- but by his incoming Secretary of State Seward. Lincoln later performed an editing miracle to transform the draft into near-poetry. Using this lesson, Obama should be asking Hillary Clinton for a draft. But that probably won't happen. Sometimes reality trumps even history. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harold Holzer.","Harold Holzer: Obama has much in common with Lincoln, the 16th president .

"(CNN) -- A person's risk of stroke is associated with the number of fast-food restaurants near their residence, according to a study presented Thursday at a stroke conference in San Diego, California. Fast-food restaurants may be associated with stroke risk, a new study says. Some say there's not enough evidence. Researchers led by Dr. Lewis B. Morgenstern at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor counted 1,247 strokes caused by blood clots in 64 census tracts in Nueces County, Texas, which includes Corpus Christi, from January 2000 through June 2003. They also mapped the county's 262 fast-food restaurants and then adjusted for socioeconomic status and demographics and found a statistically significant association. ""The association suggested that the risk of stroke in a neighborhood increased by 1 percent for every fast-food restaurant,"" the authors wrote in a poster presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference. Residents of neighborhoods in the 75th percentile of fast-food restaurants had a 6 percent increased risk of stroke compared with residents of the 25th percentile of such eateries, according to the study, which was paid for by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Morgenstern, director of the University of Michigan's stroke program and professor of neurology and epidemiology, warned that the finding does not prove that proximity to fast-food restaurants caused the increase in strokes of people living nearby.  Watch more on the link between fast food restaurants and stroke » . ""What we don't know is whether fast food actually increased the risk because of its contents or whether fast-food restaurants are a marker of unhealthy neighborhoods,"" he said. Still, he added, ""If this association is causal, the findings have large public health importance due to the high prevalence of fast-food restaurants."" A spokeswoman for the National Restaurant Association lambasted that concern as unsupported by the data. ""This article is seriously flawed and by its own admission shows no correlation whatsoever between dining at chain restaurants and incidence of stroke,"" Beth Johnson said. ""Further, it tells us nothing about the eating and exercise habits of the individuals involved. The restaurant industry continues to offer a growing number of healthier offerings, move away from the use of trans fats and provide more nutrition information. ""In fact, the National Restaurant Association strongly supports a national, uniform approach to providing detailed nutrition information in chain restaurants. Constructive and responsive measures like these, and not misleading studies, will help consumers make healthy choices for themselves and their families,"" she added.","Study looked at 1,247 strokes in Nueces County, Texas .

"Editor's note: Ed Rollins, who was political director for President Reagan, is a Republican strategist who was national chairman of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign. Ron Silver, seen in a 2006 photo, was an actor with a strong interest in justice and peace, Ed Rollins says. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The lights on Broadway were dimmed Wednesday night to honor Ron Silver, the Tony-award winning actor who was buried Wednesday after a courageous battle against cancer of the esophagus. Ron was a lifelong social liberal and a Democratic activist, but you couldn't narrowly define him. And to those of us privileged to be his friend, he was an extraordinary pal. In the 25 years we were friends, he and I faced off most of that time on opposite sides of the political spectrum. In this era when people want bipartisanship, Ron was the role model. Our earliest encounters began when I was managing Ronald Reagan's campaign and he was a Dukakis supporter. He was passionate and a true intellectual. I have spent much of my life around smart people (fortunately a lot smarter than I) and Ron was one of the smartest. Whatever the topic, he had an opinion on it and probably had just read a book or two on the subject. Ron was a Chinese and international relations scholar and had no casual thoughts, only deep convictions. He backed up his opinions with empirical evidence and could rattle off facts like a baseball statistician. ""Eddie, why do you think that way?"" (Only my mother and wife have called me Eddie.) ""Why would a smart man like you ever come to that conclusion?"" And then we would proceed to discuss the topic for hours. I don't think we ever changed each other's opinions, but after a bottle or two of wine or a bottle of Scotch had been emptied, we still respected each other. We never had a cross word and no discussion ever ended in anger. After a while I learned it wasn't personal and it wasn't because I was Republican. Ron argued with everyone -- even those on his side in an issue -- because he had great curiosity and always wanted to know more. The closest we ever came to harsh words was when I teased him on his Emmy nomination for a recurring role as a slick campaign strategist on the TV show ""The West Wing."" ""You would have won if you asked me how to play the part,"" I declared. ""After all you're just an actor. I am the real thing. I worked in the real West Wing and I managed a real campaign that won 49 states,"" He quickly replied with a big grin: ""Why the hell would I want the input of a guy who lost Minnesota [the only state Reagan lost]? And remember, you only won because you had an actor named Ron making you look good!"" Our discussions often ended in laughter. Because for Ron, politics was serious but it was also fun. I don't think he enjoyed anything more than a great political debate. To Ron, debate was an educational experience. To those of us on the opposite side it was like a combat sport. Several years ago, I was approached by one of the planners for the 2004 Republican Convention in New York. He wanted to know if I could recommend any movie or entertainment stars who would be willing to participate in the convention. Since the passing of the Reagan era, Republicans haven't had a long list of entertainers to choose from. From our discussions, I knew that Ron supported President Bush's battle against Islamic terrorism and the war in Iraq and he had been profoundly affected by 9/11. I asked him would he be willing to participate if asked. He said yes, but emphatically stated he was remaining a Democrat. But he also knew that when he publicly supported Bush on the war, it would affect his long relationships in Hollywood and could cost him future work. Ron's Monday night convention speech was short, less than five minutes and only 429 words in length. It wasn't covered by any of the major networks, but it was still one of the best of the night. When he stated: . ""I am grateful for the chance to speak tonight to express my support for our commander-in-chief, for our brave troops and for the vital cause which they have undertaken,"" his career as a major Hollywood player was over. Even though he had been a president of both the Actor's Equity Guild and the Creative Coalition that he co-founded, he challenged the entertainment industry with these spoken words: . ""Even though I am a well-recognized liberal on many issues confronting our society today, I find it ironic that many human rights advocates and outspoken members of my own entertainment community are often on the front lines to protest repression, for which I applaud them, but they are usually the first ones to oppose any use of force to take care of these horrors that they catalog repeatedly."" Ron was disappointed when he did lose future work and even a few ""so-called Hollywood friends,"" but not surprised. But he said what he believed and never regretted doing it. Ron was always determined to give back something to his country and New York, the city where he, his parents, grandparents and great grandparents were born and loved. Whether he was fighting for the cause of Israel or social justice for the poor or for more funding for the National Endowment for the Arts or AIDS research, he was passionate about his causes. Even though he was close to death, he attended President Obama's inauguration because he thought it was a great day for the country and he didn't want to miss it. And just a few weeks ago while still undergoing chemotherapy, Ron attended the latest board of directors meeting in Washington of The United States Institute of Peace. The Peace Institute is an independent, nonpartisan institution established and funded by Congress whose 12 members are appointed by the president. The organizational goals are to help prevent and resolve violent international conflicts. Ron was appointed in 2007 and was confirmed by the Senate for a four-year term. He told me it was his most important role and a part he was never prouder to play. As the dimming of the lights on Broadway signaled Wednesday night, Ron's voice is now quiet -- and missed. His life's work not only lit up Broadway and filled the big screen, it also inspired others to action. The many roles he played on the stage, in movies and on television pale in comparisons to the real roles he lived in his life. Ron was a great friend, a great father and a great American. We will miss you, my friend. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.","Ed Rollins: Ron Silver was a liberal Democrat, but impossible to narrowly define .

"(CNN) -- While all eyes seem to be on ""Slumdog Millionaire"" for the Oscars, one very courageous little girl will be focused on another India-based film at the ceremony. Pinki, like millions in developing countries, had to live with her deformity and suffer the social consequences. It's called ""Smile Pinki,"" and it's up for an Oscar, too -- nominated for best short documentary, which it won on Sunday. The little girl watching it from inside the Oscar ceremony has traveled all the way to Los Angeles, California, from her small Indian village with her dad -- and it has been an incredible journey for Pinki Sonkar. ""Smile Pinki"" tells the story of her transformation from a sad outcast to a vibrant 8-year-old with plenty of spunk. Pinki was born with a cleft lip, and her impoverished family did not have the money for corrective surgery. Like millions of other children born with the lip deformity in developing countries, Pinki simply had to live with it and suffer the social consequences. Her father Rajendra Sonkar says: ""She used to go to school and the kids would not befriend her. She would say, 'I don't want to go to school.'""  Watch how Pinki was transformed by the operation » . ""Pinki was a depressed, sad, lonely, shy, young little girl, growing up on the periphery of the society in a little village,"" said Satish Kalra, director of Smile Train's South Asian region, after meeting with Pinki. The little girl's own family was ashamed of her, Kalra says. But all of that has changed. Pinki is now a real pistol, full of energy and confidence, and she has a fantastic smile too -- thanks to the Smile Train charity. Smile Train teaches doctors in their own countries to operate on cleft lips, a deformity afflicting up to four million children across the world. iReport: Share your Oscar predictions . Pinki just happened to be one of the chosen candidates for surgery and was also chosen to be the subject of the documentary.

The film's director is Megan Mylan. She has won several awards but not an Oscar -- until now. For Pinki and her dad, being able to see the film's director win an Oscar would be a thrill. But they know they already have the greatest prize: Pinki's new smile.

"(CNN)  -- The Tennis Channel has canceled plans to broadcast a tournament in Dubai because an Israeli player was banned. Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates. Shahar Peer, the 45th-ranked women's player according to the World Tennis Association, qualified to compete in this week's Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships but was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is one of the seven emirates of the UAE. The cable network had planned to air parts of the tournament this weekend. ""Tennis Channel recognizes that this exclusion has been made by state authorities and neither the tour nor tournament directors themselves,"" said a statement posted on the channel's Web site Wednesday. ""However we also honor the role and proud tradition that tennis has always played as a driving force for inclusion both on and off the courts. ""Preventing an otherwise qualified athlete from competing on the basis of anything other than merit has no place in tennis or any other sport, and has the unfortunate result of undermining the credibility of the very nature of competition itself."" The announcement comes the same day The Wall Street Journal Europe announced it is dropping its sponsorship of the tournament. ""The Wall Street Journal's editorial philosophy is free markets and free people, and this action runs counter to the Journal's editorial direction,"" the Journal said in a written statement. The paper also said it plans to cancel a special tennis-themed advertising section scheduled for Monday and its backing of a men's tournament in Dubai scheduled for next week. After days of international criticism, including the WTA saying it would review whether the UAE should be allowed to host future tournaments, the event's organizers said Peer was barred from the tournament for her own protection, apparently alluding to Israel's recent military offensive in Gaza. ""We do not wish to politicize sports, but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the region and not alienate or put at risk the players and the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have here,"" organizers said in a written statement. The statement cited anti-Israel protests before one of Peer's matches at a recent tournament in New Zealand. But this is not the first time the UAE has barred Israeli tennis players. Last year, an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry. The emirate also cited security concerns then. In a statement posted on the Tennis Channel's site, Peer thanked the cable channel for its decision. ""I was very moved and excited to hear about your decision not to broadcast the Dubai tournament following their denial to allow me to participate in the event,"" she wrote. ""You at Tennis Channel were the first ones to add action to the words and this is leading the way to other organizations as well. ""All I want is to play tennis and do well.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A jury Tuesday acquitted three men of charges that they helped the bombers who carried out the July 7, 2005, attacks on the London transportation system. Sadeer Saleem was accused of helping to plan the July 7, 2005 bombings in London . The four bombers died in the blasts, but Waheed Ali, Sadeer Saleem and Mohammed Shakil were accused of helping them by conducting reconnaissance and conspiring with them. Two of the men -- Ali and Shakil -- were convicted of a second charge of conspiracy to attend a place used for terrorist training. They will be sentenced Wednesday, London's Metropolitan Police said. Tuesday's verdicts came at the end of the men's retrial at Kingston Crown Court in southwest London. A separate jury failed to reach a verdict in their first trial, which ended in August after three months. The bombings in 2005 killed 52 people in blasts on three subway trains and a bus. At least 900 people were wounded. Police arrested the three in March 2007 after piecing together what they called a ""complicated jigsaw with thousands of pieces."" They were charged in April 2007. Police said they analyzed more than 4,700 phone numbers and 90,000 calls. They discovered the three men had made a trip to London in December 2004 -- seven months before the fatal bombings -- which prosecutors claimed was a reconnaissance trip to scout potential targets. Prosecutors said that on December 16, 2004, the men traveled from the northern English city of Leeds to London, along with Hasib Hussain, one of the July 7 bombers. When they got to the capital, they met with Lindsay. Over the next two days, prosecutors claimed, the men visited tourist sites including the London Eye ferris wheel, the London Aquarium and the Natural History Museum, as well as underground train locations. Some of the spots, prosecutors said, were near where the July 7 bombs were eventually detonated. Police called it ""the first feasibility study"" for the London bombings -- and whether they were looking at tourist or transportation sites, the men were seeking out potential bomb targets, police said. The three men, who always denied the charges, acknowledged making the trip but said it was just an innocent outing to visit Ali's sister in London. Saleem told the court that he had had ""no idea whatsoever"" about the plot. Traces of DNA linked all three alleged accomplices in some way to the bombers, police had claimed. Investigators found Ali's fingerprints on evidence found at the bomb-making sites. Khan, Lindsay, Hussain and a fourth bomber, Shehzad Tanweer, set off a series of bombs the morning of July 7, 2005. They exploded on underground trains near Liverpool Street, Russell Square and Edgware Road and on a double-decker bus at Tavistock Square. Police have previously said they believe others with knowledge of the attacks remain at large. The jury found that in July 2001, Ali went with Khan to Pakistan. In July 2003, Shakil went with Khan to a camp in Pakistan, where the two undertook firearms training with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and AK-47 assault rifles, London police said. The jury found Ali and Shakil guilty of conspiring to attend a place used for terrorist training, knowing or believing that instruction or training would be provided for purposes connected with the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism, London police said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- William Jackson was a slave in the home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis during the Civil War. It turns out he was also a spy for the Union Army, providing key secrets to the North about the Confederacy. William Jackson, a slave, listened closely to Jefferson Davis' conversations and leaked them to the North. Jackson was Davis' house servant and personal coachman. He learned high-level details about Confederate battle plans and movements because Davis saw him as a ""piece of furniture"" -- not a human, according to Ken Dagler, author of ""Black Dispatches,"" which explores espionage by America's slaves. ""Because of his role as a menial servant, he simply was ignored,"" Dagler said.  ""So Jefferson Davis would hold conversations with military and Confederate civilian officials in his presence."" Dagler has written extensively on the issue for the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence .  Watch the stories of slaves as spies » . In late 1861, Jackson fled across enemy lines and was immediately debriefed by Union soldiers. Dagler said Jackson provided information about supply routes and military strategy. ""In Jackson's case, what he did was ... present some of the current issues that were affecting the Confederacy that you could not read about in the local press that was being passed back and forth across local lines. He actually had some feel for the issues of supply problems,"" Dagler said. Jackson and other slaves' heroic efforts have been a forgotten legacy of the war -- lost amid the nation's racially charged past and the heaps of information about the war's historic battles. But historians over the last few decades have been taking an interest in the sacrifice of  African-Americans during those war years. Jackson's espionage is mentioned in a letter from a general to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell refers to ""Jeff Davis' coachman"" as the source of information about Confederate deployments.  Watch grandson of slaves: ""They call me Little Man"" » . Dagler said slaves who served as spies were able to collect incredibly detailed information, in large part because of their tradition of oral history. Because Southern laws prevented blacks from learning how to read and write, he said, the slave spies listened intently to minute details and memorized them. ""What the Union officers found very quickly with those who crossed the line ... was that if you talked to them, they remembered a great more in the way of details and specifics than the average person ... because again they relied totally on their memory as opposed to any written records,"" he said. Jackson wasn't the only spy. There were hundreds of them. In some cases, the slaves made it to the North, only to return to the South to risk being hanged. One Union general wrote that he counted on black spies in Tennessee because ""no white man had the pluck to do it."" No one was better than Robert Smalls, a slave who guided vital supply ships in and out of Charleston Harbor in South Carolina. He eventually escaped and provided the Union with ""a turning of the forces in Charleston Harbor,"" according to an annual report of the Navy secretary to President Lincoln. ""A debriefing of him gave ... the Union force there the entire fortification scheme for the interior harbor,"" Dagler said. One of the most iconic spies was Harriet Tubman, who ran the Underground Railroad, bringing slaves to the North. In 1863, she was asked by the Union to help with espionage in South Carolina. She picked former slaves from the region for an espionage ring and led many of the spy expeditions herself. ""The height of her intelligence involvement occurred late in 1863 when she actually led a raid into South Carolina,"" Dagler said. ""In addition to the destruction of millions of dollars of property, she brought out over 800 slaves back into freedom in the North."" As the nation marks Black History Month in February, Dagler said that history should include the sacrifices of the African-Americans who risked their lives for their nation. Many paid the ultimate sacrifice. ""They were all over the place, and no one [in the South] considered them to be of any value. Consequently, they heard and saw virtually everything done by their masters, who were the decision-makers,"" Dagler said. Whatever happened to William Jackson, the spy in Jefferson Davis's house? Unfortunately, that remains a great unknown. ""He simply disappeared from history, as so many of them have."" CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report.","William Jackson, a slave, learned key details inside the home of Jefferson Davis .

"(CNN) -- After a nearly decade-long effort, the National Congress of Black Women on Tuesday honored Sojourner Truth by making her the first African-American woman to have a memorial bust in the U.S. Capitol. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and first lady Michelle Obama applaud the unveiling of the Sojourner Truth bust. Truth, whose given name was Isabella Baumfree, was a slave who became one of the most respected abolitionists and women's rights activists. ""One could only imagine what Sojourner Truth, an outspoken, tell-it-like-it-is kind of woman ... what she would have to say about this incredible gathering,"" first lady Michelle Obama said at the Celebration of Truth ceremony. ""We are all here because, as my husband says time and time again, we stand on the shoulders of giants like Sojourner Truth."" ""And just as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott would be pleased to know that we have a woman serving as the speaker of the House of Representatives, I hope that Sojourner Truth would be proud to see me, a descendant of slaves, serving as the first lady of the United States of America,"" she said. Dignitaries and congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, House Republican Leader John Boehner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, attended the ceremony marking the unveiling of the statue. Along with musical performances, actress Cicely Tyson recited ""Ain't I A Woman,"" Truth's famous 1851 speech to a women's rights convention. Clinton and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who worked together to draft legislation to commission the bust, were among speakers who paid tribute to the late C. Delores Tucker, former chairwoman of the NCBW, who spearheaded the effort for the Truth memorial. ""What a wonderful day it is to be here in Emancipation Hall for this great occasion when Sojourner Truth takes her rightful place alongside the heroes who have helped to shape our nation's history,"" Clinton said. ""Today, she takes her place in this Capitol, and we are the better for it,"" Clinton said. ""She is a sojourner of truth, by truth, and for truth. And her words, her example and her legacy will never perish from this earth, so long as men and women stand up and say loudly and clearly, 'We hear you echoing down through the years of history. We believe that your journey is not yet over, and we will make the rest of that journey with you.' "" The bronze statue, which was crafted by Los Angeles, California, sculptor Artis Lane, will stand in Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor Center. ""All the visitors in the U.S. Capitol will hear the story of brave women who endured the greatest of humanity's indignities. They'll hear the story of Sojourner Truth, who didn't allow those indignities to destroy her spirit, who fought for her own freedom and then used her powers ... to help others,"" Michelle Obama said. ""The power of this bust will not just be in the metal that delineates Sojourner Truth's face; it will also be in the message that defines her legacy. Forevermore, in the halls of one of our country's greatest monuments of liberty and equality, justice and freedom, Sojourner Truth's story will be told again and again and again and again."" In 1997, Congress passed a special act that called for relocating the Portrait Monument from the Capitol basement to the rotunda. The 7.5-ton statue depicts three leaders of the suffragette movement -- Anthony, Stanton and Mott. A group called the Sojourner Truth Crusade was upset about the statue's relocation because it didn't incorporate Truth. After Congress agreed to go ahead with a move, advocates proposed commissioning a new statue that would include Truth. In 2006, Congress passed a bill to honor the abolitionist with her own memorial.","Sojourner Truth was an abolitionist and women's rights activist .

"(CNN) -- At least 50 officers and civilians were feared dead after Bangladeshi paramilitary troops staged a mutiny, taking dozens of high-ranking officers and military brass hostage, the country's law minister said Thursday. Bangladeshi soldiers take position armed with automatic weapons in Dhaka on Wednesday. As dawn broke, the rebelling troops with the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) allowed government officials entry into the headquarters in the capital city of Dhaka -- the scene of a day-long standoff Wednesday. The troops agreed to lay down their arms after Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina agreed to offer them amnesty. Ministers went door to door within the compound's officers' quarters to assure frightened women and children it was safe to come out. ""Nearly 50 people have been killed in sporadic fighting in the headquarters of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR),"" Mohammad Quamrul Islam, state minister for law and parliamentary affairs told reporters. In addition to military officials and BDR brass, the dead and wounded included passersby, including a rickshaw puller, struck by stray bullets during the gun battle, the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said. CNN was not immediately able to confirm the exact casualty count, with medical officials saying a final number will come after they had a chance to comb through the premises looking for bodies. At around 4:30 a.m. (10:30 p.m. GMT) Thursday, Bangladeshi TV channels broadcast video of Home Minister Sahara Kahtun telling rebelling paramilitary officers in the room that she could assure them the government would listen to their grievances. As she spoke, officers deposited weapons and ammunition onto a table in front of her and into piles on the floor. The video was initially broadcast on state run TV station BTV. Various private networks picked it up soon after. The Rifles is a paramilitary force responsible primarily for guarding the country's borders. The force, more than 65,000-strong, also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls. The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week when officers and troop members from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. At least 5,000 -- maybe more -- BDR personnel were inside the compound in the Pilkhana area of the capital when the mutiny occurred about 7:45 a.m. local time Wednesday, said Mohammed Sajjad Haider, spokesman for the information ministry. Their mobile phones were turned off, making it difficult for the government to get a handle on the situation, he said. The rebelling troops were low-ranking members of the BDR, akin to infantrymen, who were angry at the way they were treated by their superiors, Haider said. ""They have several demands,"" Haider said. ""They want pay parity with the army, they want job security, they want better food rations."" The mutiny is the most serious crisis for Bangladesh's newly elected government, which came into power in December after two years of army-backed rule. Throughout the day and into the night, curious onlookers gathered outside the compound -- only to scramble for cover as sounds of gunfire periodically pierced the air. Plumes of black smoke coming from inside the compound could be seen for miles throughout the capital. Occasionally, the rebelling troops -- red bandannas covering their faces and guns slung over their shoulders -- walked past the closed gates of the compound, chanting, ""We have been deprived for a long time, we have deep grievances."" ""I've been hearing gunfire all morning,"" said Zunaid Kazi, a San Diego, California, resident who is staying at a house a few blocks from the headquarters.  Watch as Kazi describes what he saw and heard » . ""There will be a little lull and then the sustained gunfire will pick up again,"" he said. ""I can hear military helicopters in the sky.

"(CNN) -- Andriy Shevchenko's agent admits it is highly unlikely the AC Milan striker will stay at the San Siro beyond the end of the season. Shevchenko has made just two Serie A appearances in a disappointing season for Milan. Shevchenko returned to Milan on loan from Chelsea last summer but has disappointed since his move back to Italy. The Ukraine striker has found himself mainly on the substitutes' bench, making just two league appearances this season, and agent Fabio Parisi believes his client will not be in Italy next season. ""Shevchenko is a player on loan at Milan from Chelsea and I think he will return to London,"" he told www.Calciomercato.it. ""Frankly, I don't think it's possible that the Rossoneri will decide to keep him. I don't know what kind of rapport he has found with  coach(Carlo) Ancelotti and his team-mates, the only problem is that he is a player on loan and, given how the season has gone, I think Andriy will return to Chelsea. ""It does depend on who will be the coach and what he wants to do -- but I don't think the doors of Italy will re-open for him next season. ""Anyway, Sheva will decide on his own, he's quite calm, he doesn't need anyone's help. However, another country seems to me the more likely option."" Shevchenko admitted at the end of March that he would probably return to London but, after scoring for Ukraine against England and providing a crucial assist against Lecce, the 32-year-old claimed earlier this month that he hoped to still be at the San Siro next season.","Andriy Shevchenko unlikely to stay at AC Milan next season claims his agent .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Edwin van der Sar claimed the all-time British record for minutes without conceding a goal during Manchester United's 1-0 win over West Ham on Sunday. Triumphant: Edwin van der Sar holds the British goalkeeping record for most time without conceding. The Dutch veteran also took the 30-year-old English record from Steve Death last week. Death's name, with all due respect to the former Reading custodian, is not up there with the game's greats. So who is in Van der Sar's league as football's finest shot-stoppers, the men who rarely get the credit but often cop the flak? Here, Football Fanzone presents a run down of the best goalkeepers in history. Read through our picks and tell us if you disagree or if we've missed anyone in the Sound Off box below. What do you think of van der Sar's inclusion? Lev Yashin (USSR) Yahsin is the only goalkeeper ever to be named European Footballer of the Year, in 1963. Dubbed the Black Spider for his all-black outfit and what seemed like eight limbs, the Russian even invented the concept of the keeper as sweeper. In the days when keepers were not protected by referees as they are today, Yashin's bravery and acrobatics were legendary and 207 clean sheets and 150 penalties saves he made in a 22-year career tell their own story. The best keeper at each World Cup is presented with the Yashin Award. Dino Zoff (Italy) Zoff is one of just two goalkeepers to lift the World Cup having captained Italy to their third crown in 1982. He was already 40 then, making him the oldest World Cup-winning captain too. But the unflappable Zoff's achievements don't end there: he holds the record for the longest playing time without conceding in international tournaments (1,142 minutes) set between 1972 and 1974. And with 112 caps, he ranks third in the Azzurri's all-time list. A true great. Gordon Banks (England) ""What a save,"" so the commentary runs to the finest piece of goalkeeping ever and one of football's most memorable moments. Pele was certain he'd scored after meeting Jairzinho's center, heading powerfully down into the left-hand corner of the net in Brazil's 1-0 1970 World Cup group win over England. But somehow Banks scrambled across, miraculously diving to push the ball up over the bar. Banks might have been immortalized by that stop, but his absence through illness from England's subsequent quarter-final against West Germany was perhaps more telling when his replacement Peter Bonetti was made a scapegoat for the defending champions' defeat. Peter Schmeichel (Denmark) Schmeichel will go down as Sir Alex Ferguson's best signing for Manchester United, certainly pound-for-pound. Bought for just $750,000 in 1991, the imposing Schmeichel would provide United everything a world-class goalkeeper requires -- including the ability to launch a swift counter-attack. He won Euro 92 with Denmark and the Treble with United in 1999, while 13 career goals are not to be sniffed at either. He played on a season too long, maybe, but on his day there were few better. Edwin van der Sar (Holland) At 38, the rangy Van der Sar is in the very twilight of his career -- but what a career it's been. The man from Voorhout holds the record number of caps for Holland, he's won the Champions League twice and is on course to win a third Premier League title in a row with Manchester United this season. All of which makes you wonder how come he spent so long at Fulham? United fans would love to have had Van der Sar way before 2005; he has proved to be the definitive Schmeichel replacement. Iker Casillas (Spain) It's easy to take Casillas' brilliance for granted, but stand back and look at his career and it's clear he's already one of the greats. Real Madrid have always been able to lure the best, yet they've had the agile Casillas as their number-one No.1 since 1999 -- when he was still a teenager. Still only 27, Casillas is contracted to the club until 2017. He's already won two Champions Leagues and four La Liga titles. At international level he came into his own during 2008 by captaining Spain to the European Championship, becoming the first goalkeeper to do so. Ricardo Zamora's legacy is safe hands. Pat Jennings (Northern Ireland) Jennings was a late starter in the position and famously had no official coaching. His international career spanned a record-breaking six World Cups (including qualifying campaigns) across 22 years. By the time he came out of retirement to play for Northern Ireland at Mexico 1986, Jennings was 41 and ended the tournament with 119 caps. He played more than 1,000 games, including crossing the bitter north London divide by playing for Tottenham and Arsenal. The unflappable Jennings' enormous hands were his trademark and the curse of many an attacker. Gianluigi Buffon (Italy) Buffon vies with Casillas and the Czech Republic's Petr Cech to be considered the best goalkeeper around at the moment, but in a country with a long tradition of high-quality No.1s Buffon is up there with the very best. Winning the 2006 Yashin Award was the perfect riposte to his critics after Juventus' dramatic fall from grace owing to match-fixing. Buffon, an imposing figure with no obvious weaknesses, stayed loyal to the Old Lady, who made him the world's most expensive goalkeeper in 2001 when they paid Parma $46.2m for him. He's been worth every cent. Jose Luis Chilavert (Paraguay) If there's one thing a goalkeeper is not expected to do -- other than to make a mistake -- it's score a goal. Given Chilavert netted no fewer than 62 times in his career, including eight for his country, it seems only fair he should be included on this list. Brazil's Rogerio Ceni may have outscored him and Rene Higuita of Colombia might have out-done him on the chutzpah front, but Chilavert's pioneering free-kicks and penalties have made him a legend. Mohamed Al-Deayea (Saudi Arabia) Goalkeepers are known for their longevity and ability to perform into their 40s. That makes Al-Deayea a relative youngster at just 36, but the Saudi Arabian holds the world record for the most number of international appearances. Over a 16-year career for the Middle Eastern country, Al-Deayea racked up a scarcely believable 181 caps.. Having started his career playing handball, Al-Deayea went on to play in three World Cups -- and was even on the receiving end of an 8-0 thumping by eventual finalists Germany at the 2002 tournament. Guillermo Ochoa (Mexico) This one is from the left-field and a little premature for a list containing the best goalkeepers of all time. But much is expected of Ochoa, Mexico's up-and-coming talent. He's already been linked with a move to Manchester United and he is on the radar of a number of Europe's top clubs. Reliant on his amazing reflexes, Ochoa is one of the best shot-stoppers out there and great at on-the-spot improvised saves. Ochoa's already established in the Mexico set-up and is already such a big star already that the American release of the FIFA 09 video game featured him on the front cover. Definitely one to watch.","Edwin van der Sar claims British record for minutes without conceding a goal .

"(CNN) -- It's often said that a real Southerner can ""claim kin"" with anyone. Tony Rand and his son Ripley learned last year that some of their relatives were African-American. Tony Rand realized the same could be true for him. Rand, whose family can trace its roots back to the 1700s, is a Democratic state senator in North Carolina. Until he watched the 2008 CNN documentary ""Black in America,"" he had no idea that some of his relatives were black.  Although firmly anchored in the South, the Rands are spread across the country. What connects them is their link to a common ancestor -- the family patriarch William Harrison Rand. ""Hal"" Rand, as he was known to most, was a white farmer and slave owner. In 1842, Hal married Sarah Ann Mullens and they had seven children. Hal also fathered seven children with his mistress, Ann Albrooks Rand, a black woman. Every other year, hundreds of African-American descendants of Hal Rand get together at a different location for a massive family reunion. It's a time to catch up and share stories, eat barbecue and have a good time. The 2007 Rand family reunion, held in Atlanta, Georgia, was featured in ""Black in America."" After the program aired, dozens of viewers across the country had the same revelation -- they, too, were related to the Rands.  ""I was sitting there, that Saturday night, just up reading the week's papers and watching the program,"" says Rand with a hearty Southern accent.  The Rand family's missing link » . ""Then I hear, 'We are the Rands. The mighty, mighty Rands,"" he recalls, referring to the words sung by family members as they embarked on their bi-annual pilgrimage. ""And then I said to myself, 'What?'"" Tony Rand listened as the family historian, Martha Rand Hix, described the family's patriarch. ""When they were talking about William Harrison Rand, I knew that was the William Harrison Rand in our family,"" he said. ""Then they started talking about North Carolina, and I said, 'Well, God oh mighty,' ... it was just amazing.""  The next day, he telephoned his 41-year old son, Ripley Rand, and asked him to contact their black relatives. Soon, Tony and Ripley Rand were invited to attend the next Rand family reunion in July in Sacramento, California.  See photos of the Rand family members »  But, what Tony Rand didn't know was that his son, a North Carolina Superior Court judge, had already been diligently working on the family genealogy. Ripley Rand had begun typing out a hand-bound version of a 100-page manuscript compiled by his great-uncle, Oscar Ripley Rand III, and started to create a digital version. Oscar Ripley Rand III was a Rhodes Scholar and retired Army colonel who spent years researching the family's history, according to Ripley Rand. Although Oscar Ripley Rand III had scoured the National Archives and spent years collecting information about the family, his memoirs contained no mention of William Harrison Rand's relationship and children with Ann Albrooks Rand. ""My whole life I have heard about the history of our family and we had no idea about [the African-American side of the family],"" Ripley Rand said. ""The most surprising thing about it,"" he added, was that his great-uncle ""probably never heard anything about it."" Ripley Rand said he plans to attend the Rand family reunion this summer with his father and has updated his great uncle's research to include the story of the black side of the family. Both he and his father say they're looking forward to meeting their cousins. ""I think it will be fun to see what the connections are,"" Ripley Rand said. ""There's a whole group of family members who we did not know existed until last year."" The revelation has inspired a few jokes among the senator's family and friends. ""I always knew you were one of us,"" an African-American friend told the senator with a nudge and wink. Tony Rand is also quick to crack a joke about anything from sports and politics to food. Namely chitterlings -- a traditionally Southern delicacy made from pig intestines -- and barbecue pork. A few of the things a ""Yankee"" might not know much about. ""There's an old joke in the South,"" he explained. ""If somebody was cooking chitlins and collards at the same time -- the smell was so strong that the fire would try to break out of the house."" A proud member of the Wake County Chitlin Club, a group of politically active men who gather every year at the annual Chitlin Dinner, Tony Rand is proud of his Southern heritage. Calling North Carolina barbecue ""good"" won't do for the senator, who insists his state has the best ""pig pickin."" ""North Carolina is a great place, we've got the mountains, we've got good college basketball and we've got good barbecue,"" he said. ""What more could a good person aspire to?"" Given that barbecue is also a tradition at the Rand family reunion, there's already some common ground for the lawmaker and his kin. Even though he's ""expecting to meet some interesting people"" at this year's reunion, he's not expecting much in the way of barbecue ""given that it's in California and all.""","North Carolina Sen.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British union leaders will recommend Thursday ending an unofficial strike that has dragged on more than a week at the country's third-largest oil refinery, the arbitrator in the dispute announced Wednesday. Protesters at the Lindsay Oil Refinery are opposed to plans to employ non-British workers at the plant. Workers walked off the job January 28 to protest the hiring of hundreds of foreign workers for a construction project at the Lindsey oil refinery in eastern England. Their action has prompted similar ""wildcat"" strikes, unsanctioned by national unions, at other sites across the country. The compromise will involve opening 101 new jobs to British workers, the arbitration service ACAS said in a written statement. Local union leaders had earlier told demonstrators they were near their goal of being offered half the jobs involved in one of the latest subcontracts connected to the construction project -- 102 new jobs for a minimum of nine weeks. ""If you can't be happy with that, you can't be happy with anything,"" a local union official said at a demonstration televised by Britain's Sky News. The union leader did not identify himself. The French-based oil company Total, which owns the plant, confirmed a deal was in the cards. ""Union officials will present details of the agreement to the workforce at 7:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. ET Thursday) and recommend a return to work,"" Total said in a release. Stephen Hughes, a Labour legislator in the European Parliament, warned that the reported compromise could itself run afoul of European labor law, opening the way for foreign workers who lose out to British labor to claim they were being discriminated against on the basis of nationality. Union leaders have been meeting over three days with Total, Jacobs, the main site contractor, and IREM, the Italian firm hired to carry out the project, in talks moderated by ACAS. They had already rejected one proposal, a union official told CNN. Union leaders accuse Total of discriminating against British workers by subcontracting with IREM, which has hired workers from Italy and Portugal. Total rejects the allegation. Overall, the construction project has employed, directly or indirectly, 600 to 1,000 workers for about 18 months, Total said. ""It has never been, and never will be, the policy of Total to discriminate against British companies or British workers. We have been a major local employer for 40 years and the majority of our 500 permanent staff are local,"" the company said in a statement released Monday. It said IREM had won the sub-contract through a fair and legal bidding process. ACAS will investigate the bidding process and report within weeks, it said Wednesday. Hundreds of workers at British power plants and refineries have been walking off the job in unofficial ""wildcat"" strikes since the Lindsey workers put down their tools last Wednesday. Spontaneous strikes took place Tuesday in every corner of the country: at the Stanlow oil refinery in western England, Drax power station in the northeast, Petroplus Coryton Refinery in the southeast and Longannet power station in Scotland. A total of nearly 1,000 workers were off the job at the three English locations. Scottish Power did not specify how many workers were on strike. Representatives of all four plants said contractors, not full-time staff, had walked off the job, and all said operations were not affected. But resolving the Lindsey strike may not be the end of the matter. Union leaders say the strike there is only a reflection of problems with the way Britain implements European Union employment directives. Unite, one of the UK's largest unions, called last week for a national protest in London. The country's main labor groups have all issued statements in support of the striking workers. ""The government is failing to grasp the fundamental issues. The problem is not workers from other European countries working in the UK, nor is it about foreign contractors winning contracts in the UK. The problem is that employers are excluding UK workers from even applying for work on these contracts,"" Unite General Secretary Derek Simpson said Tuesday.

"(CNN)  -- Americans planning to go to Mexico should ""postpone"" their trips because of the swine flu outbreak, a top health official said Tuesday. Two women wear face masks as they arrive at Germany's Frankfurt International Airport from Mexico City. ""Based on what I know as a public health official and as a physician, I would not recommend people go on nonessential travel,"" said Dr. Richard Besser, the acting head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""If I had vacation plans in Mexico coming up right now, I'd look to postpone those,"" he said on CNN's ""American Morning."" The CDC issued a travel health warning about Mexico on Monday, and the U.S. State Department issued a travel alert -- not the more serious warning -- based on the CDC advice. U.S. consular operations in Mexico will be affected by the swine flu outbreak, the State Department said in its alert Monday. European Union health commissioner Androulla Vassiliou warned Monday against nonessential travel to ""areas which are reported to be the center of the clusters"" of infection.  Learn more about swine flu » . She did not issue a travel advisory, as some reports initially suggested. The EU does not have the power to issue such warnings. ""I would also suggest to travelers to seek immediate medical advice if they have any of the symptoms described,"" she said, in what the EU later clarified was a personal statement. Some European Union countries issued travel warnings of their own, including Britain. That prompted some tour operators to cancel trips to Mexico, including Thompson First Choice, Thomas Cook and Virgin Holidays, three of Britain's biggest travel agencies. Thompson is bringing vacationers home to Britain from Mexico and canceled flights there Tuesday. Thomas Cook put all trips to Cancun on hold for a week and offered free changes in destination to anyone booked to vacation in Mexico in May. Virgin is shelving trips to Mexico through May 5. There are probably 10,000 British people on vacation in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, Frances Tuke of the Association of British Travel Agents said . ""That's a lot of flights that are needed"" to bring them home, she said. ""There are a lot of logistics issue there in terms of bringing people home."" Carnival Cruise Lines canceled ports of call in Mexico for three of its ships Tuesday, the company said. It is continuing to finalize plans for upcoming cruises, it said, and planned to release details later Tuesday or early Wednesday. Canada's Air Transat is postponing its flights from Canada to Mexico through June 1 and from France to Mexico through May 31, it announced in a statement. Many countries are checking travelers as they arrive, including China, which is screening aggressively in the wake of the SARS outbreak that killed almost 350 people there in 2003. Indonesia is putting travelers through a thermal scanner that spots excessive heat; those who test positive go through a ""body-cleaning machine"" that sprays a disinfecting solution of 70 percent alcohol on their hands and body. The system does not detect viruses and was not put in place because of swine flu, Indonesian health officials say, but is intended as an early-warning system to prevent diseases from entering the country. Japan suspended visa waivers for Mexican visitors, a Foreign Ministry official said.

"(CNN) -- A crew member on a U.S.-flagged cargo ship captured by pirates off the coast of Somalia is suing his employers, claiming they sent him into pirate-infested waters without adequate protection, his attorney said Monday. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse has been charged with piracy in federal court in New York. Richard Hicks of Royal Palm Beach, Florida, a crew member on the Maersk Alabama, filed suit Monday against Waterman Steamship Corp. and Maersk Line Limited, according to the attorney, Terry Bryant. A spokeswoman for Mobile, Alabama-based Waterman Steamship Corp. said she did not know about the suit and did not immediately comment. A spokeswoman for Maersk Line Limited did not immediately return a call from CNN seeking comment. The Maersk Alabama was hijacked by pirates April 8. Hicks, working as chief steward and preparing food for other crew members, heard over the loudspeaker that pirates were on board, and he and other crew members gathered in the ship's engine room for nearly 12 hours, according to a news release from Bryant. ""The engine room was dark and hot, maybe 130 degrees,"" Hicks said in the news release. ""We were all cramping up with heat stroke symptoms when we were able to take a pirate hostage and tried to negotiate the return of our captain."" The pirates promised to exchange Capt. Richard Phillips for the pirate hostage, but reneged on that agreement, the news release. Phillips offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the freedom of his crew. He was held on a lifeboat until U.S. Navy snipers on a nearby ship fatally shot three pirates, rescued Phillips and arrested a fourth pirate. The ship's owners -- the two companies -- knowingly exposed their employees to danger and took no steps to provide appropriate security and safety for the crew, Bryant alleges. ""Waterman Steamship Corp. and Maersk Line Limited chose to rely on the United States military and taxpayers to provide after-the-fact rescue operations,"" Bryant said in the news release. ""This choice caused substantially more cost and risk to human life than what would have been incurred by defendants had they provided appropriate levels of security in the first place."" Hicks is seeking at least $75,000, and ""reserves the right to amend this pleading for a certain amount in the future, as it is too early to determine the maximum amount of plaintiff's damages,"" according to the suit. Hicks is still suffering from injuries as a result of the incident and is afraid to return to work, the news release said.","Suit alleges crew sent into pirate-infested waters without protection .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House and Senate Democrats reached agreement late Monday on a budget resolution for 2010, which includes key spending priorities for the young Obama administration. The Senate and House could vote on the budget resolution Tuesday. President Obama's budget request is $3.67 trillion. ""This budget is a major accomplishment,"" Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad said in a statement. ""We are meeting President Obama's goals of reducing our dependence on foreign energy, striving for excellence in education, reforming our health care system, and providing middle-class tax relief."" The agreement came as lawmakers were reconciling the House and Senate versions of the budget package. The president's budget request is $3.67 trillion. The full Senate and House are each expected to vote on the fiscal 2010 budget resolution this week. The House vote could come as soon as Tuesday. Budget negotiators have fast-tracked part of the budget process. Major health reform is likely to pass this year, because the special process -- known as budget reconciliation -- won't allow Republicans to filibuster the legislation, as was widely expected. Democrats, who currently control 58 seats in the Senate, will be able to pass it with a simple majority vote, instead of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. Separately, conservative Democrats in the House, who have been pushing for a strong statement from leadership on fiscal responsibility in the budget, may have some of their concerns addressed. A Democratic aide told CNN that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer are drafting a letter to Senate leaders ""throwing down the gauntlet"" to insist that a pay-as-you-go system be followed, which would require new federal spending to be offset with budget cuts or tax increases. President Barack Obama called for the so-called ""PAYGO"" legislation in his weekend radio address. The budget resolution would limit increases in non-defense discretionary spending to 2.9 percent through 2014, according to Conrad. ""While the budget resolution takes important steps in the near-term of cutting the deficit in half by 2012 and by two-thirds by 2014, it is clear that more will be needed to address the long-term fiscal imbalance confronting the nation beyond the five-year budget window,"" said Conrad. President Obama gathered his Cabinet members last week and challenged them to cut a total of $100 million in the next 90 days. In the context of the federal budget, $100 million in savings is a tiny amount, critics said. It is the equivalent, according to one example, of having a car dealer offer to shave $1 from the cost of a $36,700 vehicle. ""Any amount of savings is obviously welcome,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said at the time. ""But ($100 million is) about the average amount we'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year."" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said ordinary Americans would nevertheless appreciate the savings effort. ""Only in Washington, D.C., is $100 million dollars not a lot of money. It is where I'm from. It is where I grew up. And I think it is for hundreds of millions of Americans.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Editor's note: Watch The Screening Room March show at the following times: Saturday 28 March: 0730, 1800, Sunday 29 March: 0530, 1830, Monday 30 March: 0400 (all times GMT) Buzz around the release of DreamWorks' latest animated feature, ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" will add new momentum to the drive towards a fully-3D movie industry. DreamWorks Animation's 3D movie, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" should give Hollywood's new medium of choice a welcome boost in tough economic times. It is a welcome boost to the 3D schedule: The introduction of special screens and digital projectors into cinemas across the world has slowed in the last six months along with the economy. Instead of the 5,000 3D screens expected to roll out, the figure is closer to 2,000, as the cost of installing new technology during the downturn causes pause for thought. The release of ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" along with the recent announcement that Pixar 3D animation, ""Up"" will open the prestigious Cannes Film Festival in May, should give Hollywood's new medium of choice a lift. ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" which U.S. movie industry bible, Variety describes as ""'Monsters, Inc.' Meets 'War of the Worlds'"" features a fight between a collection of well-loved movie monsters ( think 1950s B-movie characters like a 50 ft woman, a friendly amorphous blob, and a genius cockroach scientist) and alien invaders who want to take over Earth. The brains behind the feature -- which has an all-star cast including Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland -- are Rob Letterman, the writer-director of Will Smith animated pic, ""Shark Tale"" and Conrad Vernon, the director of ""Shrek 2."" The film is one of a number of 3D films, like James Cameron's sci-fi ""Avatar,"" already in production that are slated for 2009 and 2010 release. Of course, 3D is not new: Films like ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and ""It Came from Outer Space""  first emerged during the affluent years of the 1950s, but because 3D was quite gimmicky the medium fell into decline and exhibitors turned their attention to other technologies. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is one of the new breed of 3D movies, projected digitally and very immersive for audiences, that Hollywood is hoping will lure paying audiences out of the comfort of their living rooms and back into cinemas. ""Hollywood is throwing themselves into 3D like never before,"" said Nick De Semlyen, critic for British movie magazine, Empire. ""All the big directors from Spielberg to Peter Jackson from 'Lord of the Rings,' they are making 3D films and it's looking like pretty much every big film is going to be in 3D in the next couple years ... It's a huge thing, it's a revolution."" Do you think 3D will be a movie revolution or is it all hype. Tell us below in the SoundOff box. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is the first film that DreamWorks Animation, the Hollywood giant behind movies like the ""Shrek"" franchise, ""Madagascar"" and last year's ""Kung Fu Panda,"" has designed from scratch as a purely 3D movie. Dennis Laws is Chief Projectionist at the BFI IMAX, which is home to the UK's biggest cinema screen and also has 3D capability. He told CNN, ""It's the first film from DreamWorks that was designed from the very beginning to be in 3D and DreamWorks are very proud of the fact."" DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg is probably 3D's most devoted advocate. He has said that the medium's introduction may be as significant to the movies as sound, and that all DreamWorks animations will be made in 3D from now on. ""Mr Katzenberg was so articulate in explaining what he wanted to do, and it was very different than anything that I had ever heard of before, which was 3-D used as a gimmick in a film,"" Keifer Sutherland told CNN at the UK premiere of ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" Watch Kiefer Sutherland talking about ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" ""He actually wanted to envelope the audience in the movie and make you feel like you were part of the scene. ""That not only knocks down the fourth wall between the movie and the audience but it also furthers telling the story."" With commercial 3D still in its infancy, all eyes are on each new release to take in the advances in the technology, which is moving forward very quickly. ""The technology is growing really fast,"" De Semlyen told CNN, ""It's very exciting.""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Good, but not enough, the Rev. Al Sharpton said in response to New York Post Chairman Rupert Murdoch's apology for a controversial editorial cartoon published in the newspaper. Online Wednesday, some Post readers reacted similarly. Rev. Al Sharpton, center, leads protests against the New York Post cartoon on February 19 in New York City. Sharpton has lead a chorus of criticism and allegations that the cartoon published Feb. 18 was racist. He said Murdoch's apology was a ""good gesture,"" but he still had questions. Public debate on the issue continued to rage on the New York Post Web site early Wednesday, with some saying they were offended enough to cancel their subscriptions. Others defended the cartoon, calling it harmless and calling critics of it oversensitive. Murdoch's ""apology leaves a lot more questions than it gives answers,"" Sharpton said Tuesday. ""The question is what will guarantee that these kinds of things will not happen again. Let us make no mistake about it: We have seen two apologies in one week -- really one and a half apologies -- which is unprecedented, but clearly not far enough."" The cartoon by Sean Delonas referenced the mauling of a Connecticut woman by a chimpanzee who was later shot and killed by police. In its caption, one of the officers says, ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill."" The cartoon was published the day after President Obama signed the stimulus bill.  Watch CNN's Lou Dobbs talk with Sharpton » . The Post issued a statement the following day, apologizing but noting that the cartoon was meant to mock what it called an ""ineptly written"" stimulus bill. Many critics said the cartoon played on historically racist images by appearing to compare Obama, the nation's first black president, to the chimpanzee. Murdoch apologized Tuesday. ""Today I want to personally apologize to any reader who felt offended, and even insulted,"" according to the statement from Murdoch, who is also chairman and CEO of News Corporation, which owns the paper. ""I can assure you -- without a doubt -- that the only intent of that cartoon was to mock a badly written piece of legislation. ""It was not meant to be racist, but unfortunately, it was interpreted by many as such. We all hold the readers of the New York Post in high regard, and I promise you that we will seek to be more attuned to the sensitivities of our community."" Leaders of the NAACP on Saturday called for the firing of Delonas. Delonas called the controversy ""absolutely friggin' ridiculous."" ""Do you really think I'm saying Obama should be shot? I didn't see that in the cartoon,"" Delonas told CNN. iReport.com: Should Murdoch, N.Y. Post do more? ""It's about the economic stimulus bill,"" he added. ""If you're going to make that about anybody, it would be (House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi, which it's not.""","Sharpton: Rupert Murdoch's apology is a ""good gesture,"" but he still has questions .

"(CNN) -- The figure peers down silently from an upper floor of the ruins of a Scottish castle, wearing what looks like an outfit from the Middle Ages. Could this be a long-dead Scottish earl, or just a random, modern-day visitor? The mysterious image captured by Chris Aitchison at Tantallon Castle in eastern Scotland. The eerie image is captured in a photograph taken by tourist Christopher Aitchison in May 2008 at Tantallon Castle, which sits on a rocky outcrop along the Scottish coast, east of Edinburgh. The ""person"" appears to be wearing an old-style greenish ruff around the neck. Aitchison insists he did not tamper with the image and cannot explain it. ""I was not aware of anyone, or anything, being present in my picture, only noticing the anomaly when I got home,"" Aitchison said. ""Staff have verified that there were no sinister dummies in period costume or historical reenactments going on that day at the castle. I did not notice any nice old ladies wearing ruffs walking around the stairs!"" The picture was made public Friday by Richard Wiseman, a professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire who also studies the paranormal. Wiseman said he was looking for ""photographic evidence for ghosts"" ahead of a session on the subject at the Edinburgh International Science Festival next week.  See gallery of haunted photographs » . Wiseman solicited such photos from around the world and collated them for the conference. He said the majority of images showed mysterious-looking orbs, mists, figures and faces. In one picture, a face appears in the side-view mirror of a parked Mercedes convertible. The photographer insists no one was around when he took the picture; skeptics say the mirror could be reflecting the headrest or be the result of digital manipulation. Another photo of a person walking through a creek in the woods appears to show a second person wearing a hooded sweatshirt, standing on a rock nearby. Skeptics say the ""figure"" is an illusion created by tree branches and the rock formation in the background. Two friends raising a drink to the camera in a third photograph are joined by a ghostly third figure in the background with a face that looks like a Halloween monster mask. ""Many of the photographs can be easily explained,"" said photographer Gordon Rutter, who also examined the pictures. ""Orbs can be caused by the camera flash reflecting off tiny dust particles, mists can result from condensed breath in front of the lens, long exposures can create ghostly figures, and apparent faces are often people seeing patterns in random shapes."" But the ""ghost"" in the Scottish castle has generated the most attention. What do you think about the image? Tantallon Castle was built in the 1350s by a nobleman and soon became the stronghold of the Douglas dynasty. For 300 years, the Douglas earls of Angus held sway at the castle as one of the most powerful families in Scotland, according to Historic Scotland, which looks after historic sites for the Scottish government. The castle also was the scene of violence, enduring three great sieges: in 1491, 1528 and 1651. The last, by Oliver Cromwell's army, resulted in such destruction that the fortress was abandoned. It remains the ""last truly great castle"" built in Scotland, with enormously thick and high stone walls enclosing large courtyards, and high stone towers. That stonework could explain the mysterious figure in the photograph, having caused unusual shadows. It is also possible that a member of the public was standing there when the picture was taken, Wiseman said -- in which case, he hopes they will come forward. ""I think it's probably a person who's been caught in slightly odd dress,"" Wiseman told CNN. ""We know the day it was taken ... so somebody might come forward to say, 'That was me.'"" He added, ""If they can explain it, e-mail me. Or indeed, if they have photos they think are better, e-mail them to me."" A similar mystery happened five years ago at another medieval site, Hampton Court Palace, built by King Henry VIII west of London. A security camera captured a figure in period dress opening a window, peering out, then closing it again. Palace officials insisted at the time that no one was in the room, and they were at a loss to explain the figure. It later emerged that a member of staff wearing a medieval costume was the person in the video.","Photograph taken by Christopher Aitchison in May 2008 at Tantallon Castle .

"(CNN) -- Chronic seizures can present a risk for adolescents, whose bodies and metabolism are changing. Jett Travolta was the elder of John Travolta and Kelly Preston's two children. A seizure disorder caused the death of Jett Travolta, the 16-year-old son of actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston, a source at a Bahamas funeral home told CNN. ""Literally dozens of different disorders can cause seizures: genetics, stroke, brain tumor, lack of oxygen, low blood sugar, drugs, even certain medications,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. Another expert said the teen years bring risks for those with seizures. ""Adolescence is a time, even if you don't talk about children with any seizure disorder, where things change in a child,"" said Dr. Shlomo Shinnar of Montefiore Medical Center in New York. There are effective drugs to treat seizures. As children grow, their bodies and metabolism change, perhaps causing a need to adjust their dosage, said Shinnar, a professor of neurology and pediatrics and director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Management Center at Montefiore. ""Seizures during adolescence can get better or worse or stay the same,"" he said. And the risk of seizures is higher for children with disabilities such as autism and cerebral palsy, Shinnar said. Jett Travolta had a developmental disability that his parents have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children. An autopsy of the actors' son was completed Monday, and the body was cremated that evening, the funeral home source said. Jett was found unconscious in the bathroom Friday while on vacation with his family. Michael Ossi, an attorney for Travolta, told CNN last week that Jett had a seizure that morning at the family's home in a resort area. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital and pronounced dead on arrival, according to local police. People.com reported that Travolta, Preston and their 8-year-old daughter Ella Blue arrived in Florida on Monday night with Jett's ashes.  The reports that a seizure disorder caused Jett's death were preliminary, Gupta said. ""It tells us more about what did not happen than the ultimate cause of death. It rules out brain injury, bleeding on brain, skull fractures, rules out heart problems due to Kawasaki disease, which is the disease the Travoltas say their son suffered,"" he said. Kawasaki disease, believed to be caused by an infection, inflames the heart muscles.  In 2001, Travolta told CNN's Larry King that his son had a near brush with death related to the condition. ""I was obsessive about cleaning -- his space being clean, so we constantly had the carpets cleaned. And I think, between him, the fumes and walking around, maybe picking up pieces or something, he got what is rarely a thing to deal with, but it's Kawasaki syndrome,"" Travolta said of his then-2-year-old son. Dr. Cam Patterson, general cardiologist at the University of North Carolina and a genetics expert who follows Kawasaki disease, told CNN, ""There is no real good link at all between Kawasaki disease and cleaning products. ""Kawasaki disease is due to an abnormal immunnologic response, probably to an infectious agent or infection we don't yet understand,"" Patterson said. ""There is nothing that links environmental toxins to this problem."" Someone with Kawasaki could have seizures for one of two reasons, but they would be rare, he said. ""One, sometime in the past one of the arteries in the brain ruptured and caused stroke,"" he said.  ""Two, if the artery had enlarged enough, it could be pressing on parts of brain and that could cause seizure. Both possibilities are unusual for Kawasaki disease."" A very small study released in 1991 found an association between cases of Kawasaki disease in homes where carpet had been cleaned in the past 30 days. ""It's very easy to find correlations, but doesn't mean causative,"" Patterson said. The next step would have been to conduct more tests, by taking toxicological tests and brain examinations to see what could have caused the seizure. ""Even with physical evidence and a deeper look by neuropathologists, we still may never have an answer,"" Gupta said on CNN's American Morning. CNN's Stephanie Smith and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","Seizures in teenagers can be caused by dozens of disorders, genetics .

"AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (CNN) -- Investigators are trying to determine what caused the crash of an airplane with a good safety record, flown by a well-respected airline, at one of the world's most modern airports. One of the casualties is taken from the crash site. At least nine people were killed and 55 injured when the Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 crashed Wednesday in a field near Amsterdam's main airport, splitting into three parts, officials said. It is too early to determine the cause of the crash but the flight data and voice recorders have been recovered, said Michel Bezuijen, acting mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality, which is home to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. He said investigators still need to determine what, if anything, the pilots said in the moments before the crash. The injured included both crew and passengers, he said. The names of the dead and injured will not be released before Thursday, Bezuijen said. ""It will take more time. Probably tomorrow afternoon we can tell you about the identity of the victims, including the fatalities,"" he said. Another official said earlier that both pilots and an apprentice pilot are among the dead. ""There are still three crew members in the cabin,"" said Bob Steensma of the Dutch Justice Department. ""I'm sorry to say they are dead. We leave them there because we have to investigate the cockpit before we take the cockpit apart."" Turkish Airlines said earlier the plane was carrying 134 people -- 127 passengers and seven crew members. Six people were critically injured, Ineke Van Der Zande of Amsterdam Emergency Services told reporters at a briefing.  Watch aerials from the crash site » . Twenty-five passengers were severely injured, she said, and 24 were lightly injured. Some 60 ambulances transported 84 people to 11 hospitals throughout the region, she said. There was no word on injuries to the others who were transported. Witnesses said they saw the nose of the plane pitch up suddenly before the crash, according to RTL journalist Greg Crouch. The plane broken into three pieces. One break was in front of the wing, splitting the ""Turkish"" logo in two, and a larger break was farther back along the fuselage. Most of the injured were seated toward the back of the plane, which sustained the most damage, a passenger on the plane told Turkish station NTV. Many of the passengers simply walked off the plane through the cracks in the fuselage, witnesses said. A passenger on the plane who spoke to Turkish network DHA said he saw injured people trapped and squeezed between the seats when he walked out. iReport: Send your videos, stories . Flight 1951 was arriving at Schiphol from Istanbul, Turkey, when it went down around 10:40 a.m. (4:40 a.m. ET). It came to rest in a farmer's field about 500 yards short of the runway, near the major A9 highway. Crouch said the weather at the time was partly sunny with no wind or rain. No fire broke out after the crash, Bezuijen said.  Watch how Twitter was first to report the crash » . A bank manager who was a passenger on the plane told NTV that there were no emergency announcements. The crew's last word to the cabin was an announcement to fasten their seat belts and prepare for landing, the bank manager said. He said he felt the pilot giving more power to the engines before feeling ""turbulence,"" then a sudden drop. He described the crash as similar to a sudden impact that was over in a matter of seconds. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of investigators to Amsterdam to assist in the crash investigation. The Boeing 737-800 is a reliable aircraft that has been successful and safe in service, said aviation expert Kieran Daly of Air Transport Intelligence. ""They really are pretty much state-of-the-art airlines with every imaginable technical benefit the industry has come up with over the years,"" Daly told CNN. ""You would be optimistic that they would be quite survivable in an accident."" Daly said Turkish Airlines, a national carrier, has a ""very good record."" Turkish Airlines said it has 52 Boeing 737-800s in its fleet. They can carry as many as 165 passengers each, it said. Before Wednesday, the airline's last accident was of a small commuter jet in 2003, Daly said. It was a fatal crash that happened at a remote airfield in southeastern Turkey, he said. ""Their mainline operation is safe,"" Daly said. ""Their pilots are well thought of."" Worldwide, there have been two fatal commercial airline crashes this year. The last previous fatal incident at the Amsterdam airport happened in April 1994 when a KLM aircraft crashed as it tried to return to Schiphol shortly after takeoff.

"(CNN) -- Investigators are pursuing several new leads in the case of a missing 5-year-old girl in Florida, they said Tuesday. Haleigh Ann-Marie Cummings, 5, who vanished a week ago, may have been abducted, police say. The Putnam County Sheriff's Office on Monday night searched the neighborhood of Haleigh Ann-Marie Cummings, who vanished a week ago. Deputies also searched surrounding neighborhoods. Authorities said the girl may have been abducted. Officials wouldn't release any details on the leads. ""Those leads, like I said, are as a result of doing the neighborhood canvass last night, and we will be following up on those leads today,"" said Capt. Steve Rose of the Putnam Sheriff's Office. Since opening the case a week ago, authorities have received more than 1,200 tips about the missing girl, 500 of them since Monday, Putnam County Sheriff Rick Ryan said. Tuesday afternoon, the sheriff's office announced they have changed the Amber Alert they originally put out for the little girl, saying they changed the description of the clothing. ""What we need people to focus on is the face, because we do not know at this time what the clothing was at this point,"" said Dominick Pape with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Rose said investigators also conducted a checkpoint in the area last night. Ronald Cummings' girlfriend, 17-year-old Misty Croslin, told police she was watching Haleigh when she went missing sometime before dawn February 10.  Watch why police now question the sitter's story » . Cummings shares his double-wide mobile home with Croslin, daughter Haleigh and a 4-year-old son in Satsuma, east of Gainesville. He has said that when he returned home at 3 a.m. ET, he was surprised to see Croslin awake and asked her why she was up. Croslin waited until Cummings came home to phone 911 about the girl's disappearance, though it's unclear how long that wait was, authorities said.

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- They have come to glimpse the miracle. They have come to witness the revolution. They have come for ""Watchmen"" -- the allegedly unfilmable superhero movie, the long-awaited adaptation of the comic book that changed the face of comic books forever. Billy Crudup plays Dr. Manhattan, a powerful superhero in ""Watchmen."" On this warm July morning, over 5,000 fans attending the annual geek pop summit known as Comic-Con have assembled inside the San Diego Convention Center for a first look. Many spent the night on the sidewalk. Some have come in costumes. Behind the stage, indie-movie icon Kevin Smith parks himself in front of a closed-circuit TV, a happy grin on his bearded mug. ""You have to understand, I've been waiting for this moment for years,"" says Smith. ""This is it, man. This is the pinnacle."" All this, for a violent, ironic superhero epic that doesn't like superheroes in the first place. Directed by ""300's"" Zack Snyder, ""Watchmen"" presents a set of familiar superhero archetypes -- and then subverts them completely. Rorschach (Jackie Earl Haley) is like the Spirit ... except he's a joyless, hard-line misanthrope. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is like Captain America ... but loyal only to sadistic thrills and a corrupt worldview. Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is part Batman, part Iron Man ... except he's also a schlubby, impotent coward. Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the resident genius ... who's built an empire on superhero toys. (You see what we mean by irony.) Says Billy Crudup, whose blue, naked Dr. Manhattan is an almighty Superman dangerously detached from his own humanity: "" 'Watchmen' is a kind of thrilling thought experiment. What would people who dress up in costumes to fight crime actually be like? Well, they'd probably be fetishists who lived on the fringes of society. They'd all be a bunch of freaking lunatics."" Yet for all its self-awareness and cynicism, ""Watchmen"" isn't some cheap-and-silly ""Scary Movie"" parody. Adapted faithfully, if not completely, from the celebrated 1986 comic-book series, Snyder's film is visually and intellectually ambitious, filled with heady ruminations about savior figures, pop culture, and the politics of fear. At a time when superhero stories are commonplace and our shaken country is pinning its recovery on an idealistic new president, ""Watchmen's"" director believes his movie can serve as a bracing blast of healthy skepticism. ""Someone asked me if I thought that because Barack Obama had been elected president, the movie was no longer relevant. I said, 'Wow, that's a very optimistic view of the future!' "" says Snyder. ""The movie, like the comic, says, 'These superhero stories you've been feasting on? What if we took them seriously?' ... That's the fun."" But fun for whom? When ""Watchmen"" hits theaters on March 6, the comic-book cognoscenti will be there in droves -- although some are already sweating the heresy of dramatic changes. EW: What didn't make it? And, for mainstream moviegoers, such talk of ""subverting superhero archetypes"" is liable to elicit a great big ""Huh?"" EW: A ""Watchmen"" primer . ""Watchmen's"" financial backers are clearly hoping the success of ""The Dark Knight"" has primed the market for sophisticated superhero films -- especially one that's two hours and 41 minutes long. But where ""The Dark Knight"" transcended genre conventions, ""Watchmen"" wallows in them. Violently. Created by writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, ""Watchmen"" is most often praised as the comic book that brought respect and maturity to a medium long dismissed as juvenile. It was the fanboys' ""Catcher in the Rye"" -- and maybe their first Playboy, too. ""I was 13 when I read 'Watchmen,' and it came to represent my coming of age,"" says ""Lost"" co-creator Damon Lindelof. ""I felt like 'Watchmen' was this very, very bad thing that I shouldn't be reading, and if my mom caught me with it I'd be f---ing doomed."" Hollywood was similarly struck by ""Watchmen,"" but has been much less successful at avoiding the doom. In 1986, Twentieth Century Fox acquired the comic's rights for producer Larry Gordon, but could never get an adaptation rolling. Over the next decade, ""Watchmen"" bounced among many studios and between many before finding what appeared to be a happy ending at Paramount. But in 2005, with helmer Paul Greengrass deep into preproduction, a Paramount regime change killed the project. Certainly, it's a hard project to get your head around. ""Watchmen"" is set in the year 1985. The U.S. and the Soviet Union are on the brink of nuclear war, and the president is Richard Nixon, whose success at ending the Vietnam War (he asked Dr. Manhattan to blow up the Vietcong) has earned him five terms of office from a grateful nation. Conservative politics are popular, as are Indian fast food and pirate comics. But costumed heroes, once all the rage, are now outlawed. When the Comedian gets murdered, Rorschach tries to round up his old allies to investigate. They eventually uncover an insidious conspiracy hatched by an unlikely villain, one whose grand ambition isn't world domination but something else altogether. iReport.com: Will you watch 'Watchmen'? And that's only half the comic. Hence, ""Watchmen's"" rep as the Unfilmable Graphic Novel. But tides changed in late 2005 when Warner Bros. acquired the property from Paramount (or at least they thought they did) with the hope of rolling on ""Watchmen"" ASAP. (Warner Bros. is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN and Entertainment Weekly.) The studio turned to Snyder. At that point, the director had only done stylish TV commercials and the 2003 zombie remake ""Dawn of the Dead."" But he was also deep in the middle of shooting the studio's action epic ""300,"" another adaptation of a brilliantly brutal comic, and the execs liked what they were seeing. Snyder's approach was simple: He would remain religiously faithful to the comic. ""We treated that thing like a freakin' illuminated text,"" says the director, who embraced all the peculiar idiosyncrasies, from the Nixonian alternative America to the deep-dive digressions into character origin stories. (None of this faithfulness can please Moore, who feels that no adaptation can do his work justice and has taken his name off the film.) The director also believed that an ""adult"" superhero epic needed to be explicit about its ""adult"" content. He wanted to hear the characters' philosophical musings. He wanted to see the blood spurt. And instead of the chaste kisses of most superhero movie romances, he wanted to see some naked getting-it-on. ""I wanted to make sure everyone understood: This is not a kid movie,"" says Snyder. ""Violence has consequences. And doing that with a PG-13 just dilutes that message."" And then there was the worry that all that effort was all for naught. Last February, Twentieth Century Fox sought to stop Warner Bros. from moving forward with ""Watchmen's"" release, claiming via lawsuit that Warner Bros. had not properly acquired the distribution rights. The dispute exploded in the media last August when a judge declared that Fox's lawsuit had merit. ""How do you not know whether or not you have the right to make a movie?"" says Crudup. ""Hilarious."" But after months of intense press coverage that put ""Watchmen"" in the mainstream eye, the two studios reached a settlement. (Warner Bros. and Fox both declined to comment. As for producer Gordon: ""It was unfortunate,"" he says simply.) Now Team ""Watchmen"" waits to see if any of that notoriety can help make them some money. With a $100 million-plus budget and a running time of 161 minutes, ""Watchmen"" will need to launch with a big opening weekend and strong reviews. So, will geek love -- and geek dollars -- be enough? Snyder hopes so. He says he made the film for that crowd. ""I don't think there ever has been a movie more custom-made for them. Not at this scale,"" he says. ""And now they have an opportunity to really influence pop culture in a serious way, just as the comic influenced comics. They can say: 'These stories can be used to say something about the world. Give us more of them.' "" This is an edited version of Entertainment Weekly's cover story on ""Watchmen."" For the complete story, click here.

"(CNN)  -- Everyone was blogging about Tuesday's inauguration -- even the people who were putting it on. President Obama, pictured, giving his inaugural speech. Fittingly for an election campaign that was won partly by galvanizing millions of young people to get out and vote via the Internet, Obama's inauguration ushered in a new digital age for the U.S. presidency. As the clock struck 12.01 in Washington Obama's administration took control of the White House Web site, with the simple words ""Change has come to America."" The first blog post by director of new media for the White House, Macon Phillips, said: ""Millions of Americans have powered President Obama's journey to the White House, many taking advantage of the Internet to play a role in shaping our country's future."" It was an unprecedented move in the history of presidential inaugurations and it reflected the mood of the blogosphere, which came alive with comments as excitable bloggers mulled on topics ranging from what Michelle Obama would wear to their thoughts on Obama's speech.  Watch President Obama's full speech » . The New Yorker's George Packer wrote in his blog that ""President  Obama uttered no words today that will be quoted in a hundred years."" ""He delivered something better than rhetorical excitement -- he spoke the truth, which makes its own history and carries its own poetry,"" Packer added. But it was not just traditional bloggers who were giving their two cents worth. Social network sites were also buzzing with the excitement of the occasion. CNN.com provided a live video streaming platform for Facebook users to interact with the inauguration ceremony by updating their status as they watched proceedings. Online viewers could choose between their friends or ""everyone watching,"" seeing live thoughts such as ""I've actually got shivers!"" to ""Barack H.? What a copout!"" Many were captivated by Aretha Franklin's eye-catching hat, with comments ranging from: ""Now that's a hat,"" to ""Aretha is wearing the hell outtta that hat."" There was also no escaping the ubiquitous ""Tweeple"" (Twitter people) posting 'tweets' on everything from their opinion of the inaugural speech to their celebrity spots. One 'tweeter' even blogged about using the VIP toilets at the inauguration site in Washington, saying: ""Just used the VIP porta potty. Contrary to what they might tell you, fancy people's **** does indeed stink."" More than 40,000 photos of the events on Capitol Hill tagged with the word ""inauguration"" were also posted to the photo-sharing site, Flickr. No aspect of the inauguration was left undissected, but Pastor Rick Warren's invocation prayer proved a hot topic amongst bloggers, who by turns criticized him for being too inclusive and not inclusive enough. Warren attracted some criticism for using words from the Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy texts as well as including the name of Jesus -- in several languages including Hebrew. However Dan Gilgoff, the ""God & Country"" blogger for U.S. News & World Report, acknowledged the difficult position Warren faced when he wrote: . ""For me, the two most salient features of the Rev. Rick Warren's inauguration invocation were its emphasis on the values of unity and mutual respect, which seemed partly a reaction to the controversy his selection as invocation speaker sparked, and its bold invocation of Jesus in the form of the Lord's Prayer. ""For some, those two themes would seem incongruous. It was trademark Warren, who -- like Barack Obama -- has been accused of trying to be all things to all people."" For some, it was about looking ahead to how long the adulation for President Obama would last. Conservative blogger Dr. Melissa Clouthier, who was liveblogging the inauguration, debated that the ""Obasm"" would last 4 years. ""His voters voted for him not for his ideas,"" she wrote. ""He didn't really articulate specific plans. He just gave vague promises. Voters were so enamored with the idea of him and he'll be around for four years, so the love will continue. ""The Press and the voters, too, imbued Obama with so much wonderfulness that to turn on him is to turn on their own perfect judgment. Since the vote was essentially narcissistic and people don't hate themselves, Obama will be loved for a good long time."" It remains to be seen whether her prediction will come true.","Inauguration set blogosphere alive with comments .
From Facebook to Twitter, everyone wanted to have their say online .
Obama's speech, Michelle's outfit and Rick Warren's prayer proved popular themes ."
"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The Israeli Military said Thursday that the ""vast majority"" of Palestinians killed in the recent Gaza conflict were ""terror operatives"" and the number of people killed was less than Palestinian sources reported. Israel says the majority of Palestinians killed during ""Operation Cast Lead"" were ""terror operatives."" In an e-mailed statement the Israel Defense Forces spokesman's office claimed their figures contained the names of 1,166 Palestinians killed in the conflict, called ""Operation Cast Lead."" The Israeli military said 709 of them were ""identified as Hamas terror operatives, among them several from various other terror organizations."" The remaining, the statement claims, were comprised of 162 names who ""have not yet been attributed to any organization."" ""Furthermore, it has come to our understanding that 295 uninvolved Palestinians were killed during the operation, 89 of them under the age of 16, and 49 of them were women."" The Israeli military said it was releasing the findings to counter ""false information originating from various Palestinian sources, and in order to remove any doubt regarding the number of Palestinians killed in Operation Cast Lead."" The numbers presented by the Israeli military differ sharply from those reported by Palestinian sources. At the conclusion of the fighting, the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza had put the death toll at over 1,300, with the majority made up of non-combatants. More recently the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) published a study that put the total death toll at 1,417, including 926 civilians of which 313 were children under the age of 18 and 116 women. It reports that the remainder was made of 255 ""non-combatant"" police officers and 236 who were took ""an active part in hostilities."" Jaber Wishah, a deputy director for PCHR told CNN his organization ""stands firmly on our published figures"" and that Israel's choice to classify police officers as combatants is ""illegal."" ""Such classification constitutes a willful violation of the principle of 'distinction' which is a key component of customary international law. This raises serious doubts about the accuracy of the figures published by the Israelis,"" he said. Wishah said the civilian death toll included ""large numbers of deaths inside people's homes and other civilian facilities"" and that it indicated ""the extent to which civilians were intentionally targeted."" Wishah said that until the Israeli government produced the names and details on which its figures were based that he could not comment further. The Israeli military has maintained that it went to great lengths to minimize civilian deaths and put the responsibility of civilian deaths on Hamas. ""The Hamas terror organization placed the primary fighting scene at the heart of civilian neighborhoods as it booby-trapped homes, fired from schools and used civilians as human shields,"" the IDF said. Asked about the discrepancy in numbers, an Israeli military official suggested that natural occurring deaths in Gaza had been included in the Palestinian death toll numbers and that the total ratio of non-combatant to combatants killed was low. A spokesman for the Israeli military said it could not immediately make the list of killed Palestinians available and could not offer more detail on methodology.","Israel: ""Vast majority"" of Palestinians killed in Gaza were ""terror operatives""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Layoffs for sea lions? Furloughs for frogs? Is there no job security, anywhere? State budget cuts mean New York's 76 zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums will lose $9.1 million in funding. The recession may be coming to a zoo near you. State budget cuts mean many zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose crucial state funding for their exhibits. New York's 76 zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose $9.1 million in state funds next year. ""We're faced with this very difficult problem of firing the animals, as it were,"" said Steve Sanderson, the CEO of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium. They will lose $3 million to budget cuts. The Bronx Zoo has made a short video posted on its Web site www.bronxzoo.com/ to draw attention to the cuts. In the video, the zoo director fires a porcupine and a frog. ""I am sure you have heard that Gov. [David] Paterson's proposed budget will mean severe cuts here at the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium,"" the zoo director says. ""Next year, all 76 zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums in the state will lose all of their state funding. There is no easy way to say this: Even though you bring record numbers of people to New York and help the economy, we are going to have to let you go."" Firing a porcupine and a frog may be a cute way to get publicity for their budget woes, but it's a serious matter and zoo officials say the recession will certainly affect the animals. Zoo officials say some collections with ""short life cycles"" will not be replaced when they die, and other animals could be sent to other zoos or wildlife sanctuaries. The state of New York funds just 2.7 percent of the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium's budget, but zoo officials say it will be difficult to make up. Between the state budget cuts, the loss in the value of their endowment and fewer people renewing memberships -- times are so tough for the zoo and aquarium -- they say they may lay off 120 to 130 people. ""Two-thirds of our budget is people, and so two-thirds of the cuts will come in cutting positions,"" Sanderson said. ""And we'll also cut back what we provide in the way of education and entertainment and nature experiences for people. So it affects everything."" Zoo officials questioned the state's priorities. But just about everybody getting taxpayer funds has to cut back. Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the New York State Budget Office told CNN the cuts are regrettable but necessary considering the state's current financial crisis. Citing a ""dramatic reduction in revenue,"" Gordon said, ""Every entity that receives state funds must do what the state has done, which is to review its operations and identify ways to operate at lower costs."" The Bronx Zoo isn't the only one affected; cutbacks are happening everywhere. The Los Angeles Zoo in California stopped work on its $42 million elephant exhibit last year, and there are big budget cuts for zoos in Maryland, Missouri and North Carolina. There's no relief for the zoos in the $819 billion economic stimulus package. Section 1109 of the stimulus bill which passed this week in the House forbids the use of federal taxpayer money to plug the budget gaps. Taxpayer watchdog groups lobbied to keep zoos, aquariums, swimming pools, golf courses and casinos out of the stimulus, arguing that there are higher priorities for Americans' money during a recession.","State budget cuts threaten funding for zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States signed an agreement Thursday on civil nuclear cooperation with the United Arab Emirates. Calling the agreement ""a powerful and timely model for the world and the region,"" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed the deal, along with UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. ""We applaud the UAE's commission -- commitment to the highest standards of safety, security and nonproliferation in its pursuit of nuclear power,"" Rice said. Congress has to ratify the agreement before it can take effect, and congressional critics fear it could spark an arms race and proliferation in the region. The UAE's ties to Iran also have caused concern. Under the ""1-2-3 deal,"" similar to one the United States signed last year with India, Washington would share nuclear technology, expertise and fuel. In exchange, the UAE commits to abide by the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. The small oil-rich Gulf nation promises not to enrich uranium or to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear bombs. The deal is part of a major UAE investment in nuclear energy. It has already signed deals to build several nuclear power plants. ""We are a country that is very rich in its oil and gas, but we do look forward that we have a program, a nuclear, peaceful program that could sustain our future needs,"" said bin Zayed. Rice said she hoped existing work by U.S. companies on the UAE nuclear program would be expanded under the agreement. ""We believe our technology is the best in the world, and we hope that the UAE will give that technology strong consideration,"" she said. The United States has stressed its role in global nonproliferation initiatives and has donated $10 million to establish an International Atomic Energy Agency international fuel bank. The U.S. has held up the UAE's development of nuclear energy in stark contrast to Iran, which is suspected of enriching uranium for a nuclear bomb. Rep. Howard Berman, a Democrat from California, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the safeguards in the agreement ""encouraging"" but voiced concerns that Iran could take advantage of the agreement. ""This could be a significant advance in nonproliferation policy, and a model for future nuclear cooperation agreements,"" Berman said in a statement. ""However, I and many other members of Congress place a very high priority on the international effort to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability and will be analyzing this and any other nuclear cooperation agreement in the context of how it implicates the attainment of that goal."" Iran is the among the UAE's largest trading partners. In the past, the port city of Dubai, one of the UAE's seven emirates, has been used as a transit point for sensitive technology bound for Iran. Dubai was also one of the major hubs for the nuclear trafficking network run by Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan. But U.S. officials said the UAE has taken major steps to improve export controls and prevent money laundering. Still, such ties contributed to stiff opposition in Congress to the failed deal for Dubai Ports World to manage U.S. ports. The U.S. already has similar agreements with Egypt and Morrocco, and U.S. officials said Washington is working on similar pacts with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan.","U.S. Congress has to ratify the agreement before it can take effect .

"This is the second part of a two part series on the best used luxury cars. (AOL Autos)  -- Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range. The Porsche 911 has several versions, but all have been annointed with the ""supercar"" appellation. Using CR's recommendations as a guideline, here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $30,000+ price range: . 2007 Acura MDX . The newer MDX is classified as a crossover SUV, but it's a deluxe version. It was all-new in '07, and was built on a proper platform -- as opposed to being adapated from the Accord passenger-car platform. It also came in three flavors: Base, Technology and Sport Packages, and all three were powered by a 3.7-liter 300-hp V6. The voice-activated navigation system is a nifty feature, as it comes with rearview camera and AcuraLink satellite communications with real-time traffic data. AOL Autos: Used Acura . 2007 BMW 328i sedan . The 328i is another sleek, finely-tuned and beautifully-designed driving machine, offering sporty performance and Euro-style luxury. It is widely considered to be the definitive ""sports sedan."" The '07 328i was propelled by a 3.0-liter 230-hp inline six-cylinder engine, which you can find mated to either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. Consumer Reports also recommended the 3-Series coupe and convertible that joined BMW's model line-up in '07.  AOL Autos: Used BMW . 2004 BMW M3 . The M3 is the top-of-the-line, high-performance-tuned version of the 3-series coupe. Performance power, therefore, is much higher than the other 3-Series editions. It came as a coupe or convertible, and churned out 333 horses. The M3 is often favorably compared to the Porsche 911 when it comes to quick acceleration, crisp braking and taking tough corners at brisk speeds without breaking a sweat. 2007 Infiniti FX35 . Well, the marketplace surely is not lacking for luxury crossovers. Here is yet another one that appeals to luxury buyers with its balance of SUV-type spaciousness, pampering amenities, deft handling and burly engine muscle. For '07, the FX35 was a two-wheel-drive vehicle powered by a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission. AOL Autos: Used Infiniti . 2006 & 2007 Infiniti M . Infiniti's M series is another winner, which seamlessly synergizes sleek styling, aggressive engine performance and a bevy of luxo-line amenities. It comes in both the M-35 and M-45. During the last used-model year, '07, the primary distinction between the two was that the M35 was powered by a V6 that kicked out 275 horses, while the M45 muscled up to a 325-hp V8. Luxury features included standard leather seats with heating and ventilation, and optional 10-way power adjustments for the driver's seat. Lexus . Just like in the $24,000-to-$30,000 category, Consumer Reports recommended a slew of world-beating used Lexus models in this segment: the '06-'07 6-cylinder GS RWD; the '07 GS450h Hybrid; '05-'07 GX; '07 IS; '04-'07 LS; '03-'06 LX and '06-'07 RX. AOL Autos: Used Lexus . Lexus has placed No 1 in the JD Power Dependability Survey every year for the last 12 years - until '07, when another carmaker, Buick, finally tied them for first. Porsche 911 (various years) Consumer Reports included the '98 911 in the $24,000 to $30,000 category. Here, the model years get more recent as the price range climbs. The 911 went through some changes over this time period, of course, but all have been anointed with the ""supercar"" appellation. AOL Autos: Used Porsche . And by the latest recommended used-model year, the '07, you could choose among various styles and engine sizes, including the Carrera, with its 3.6-L 325-hp flat-six plant; the Carrera S and S Cabriolet, with the 3.8-L 355 hp V6; the 911 Turbo, with twin-turbocharged 480 hp six-cylinder engine; and the GT3 track model, powered by a high-revving 415-hp six-cylinder engine.","Newer Acura MDX is classified as a crossover SUV, but it's a deluxe version .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Yet another scale Il Divo has mastered: scaling the heights of success. The quartet was formed in 2004 after a global search. The operatic quartet's new album, ""The Promise,"" debuted atop the UK charts, their third collection to hit the No. 1 spot. The album (which was released in the U.S. last Tuesday) features Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ""The Power of Love,"" and the traditional ""Amazing Grace."" Il Divo also takes a chance on the ABBA hit ""The Winner Takes it All."" The group is the brainchild of ""American Idol"" judge Simon Cowell, who saw a potential market for an international, ""popera""-style act after the soaring success of the Andrea Bocelli-Sarah Brightman duet ""Time to Say Goodbye (Con te Partiro).""  Watch Il Divo in action » . Formed in 2004 after a global search, Il Divo (Italian for ""divine male performer"") consists of Spanish baritone Carlos Marin, American tenor David Miller, French pop singer Sebastien Izambard, and Swiss tenor Urs Buhler. According to Syco Music, Il Divo's UK-based label, the quartet has sold more than 22 million albums worldwide. It seems Cowell knew what he was doing. CNN caught up with Il Divo to find out how close they are to Cowell, and which American pop diva they dream of collaborating with. CNN: Who do you most get compared to, the Three Tenors or the Backstreet Boys? Carlos Marin: (laughs) It's a mix of everything. I mean at the end [of the day] we are just a pop act. We just sing pop songs, and we just converted mostly the big endings into operatic style. But we are just us, Il Divo. CNN: Are you surprised by how much of a hit you've become? Marin: In a way, yeah. I still remember the first time we went to number one (in the UK). We knocked out Robbie Williams and it was just like ""Wow!"" CNN: What is the big appeal of Il Divo? Urs Buhler: I think it has a lot to do with the big variety we have inside the group, the fact that we are all from four different countries, from different cultural music backgrounds. And we bundle all those different energies ... and bring it together for that one cause -- to make the most beautiful music that we possibly can together. It's not like we have a strategy or recipe for it, it's just that we're passionate about what we do. It works somehow. It's magic. CNN: How involved is [Simon Cowell] with the day-to-day Il Divo operation? Buhler: With the day-to-day operation, I would say his involvement is next to nothing. He's only involved in the actual A&R-ing and the executive producing, which means we meet him about twice a year for an hour. CNN: You took a lot of time off in 2007. In fact you took nearly the whole year off. When you regrouped did you find anything was different? David Miller: Absolutely. The first three years were just a roller coaster of experiences: having the number one in the UK and then that turning into the number one in all the different countries, and going all around the world and being on tour, being on tour with Barbra Streisand and then more albums. Everything kind of bled into everything else and we didn't really have any time to appreciate all the things that we had done. So after this break, [when] we came back together in the studio, it was really like a breath of fresh air. Like the magic of the first album was back. We could appreciate the music again. We could appreciate each other again. And it was a lot more relaxed and a lot more fun. CNN: When you're standing on stage and you look out at the audience what do you see ... is there a certain age range, a certain sex? Miller: It depends on the country we go to. For example, when we go to the UK, it's a slightly more mature audience. When we go to Spain it's a lot younger audience. When we go to South Africa, it's a family affair. So it really just depends, but everywhere we go the universal thing that ties them all in is that they're all music-lovers and they appreciate what we do. CNN: How many languages do you sing in? Buhler: We [sing] in French, Latin, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English ... that would be six. And we speak about seven or eight. CNN: Do you speak the language of love? Marin: Yes, we do! Buhler: That would be the ninth language. CNN: Who is the biggest diva in the group? Marin: We are really four divas. Four captains, one ship. Sebastien Izambard: We have very strong personalities, and we're the producers of our tour and we sit down -- the four of us -- and decide what we're going to do, what set, what choice of the music or lighting. We're four grown-up people and we make that very possible. [In the beginning] everyone had their own opinions. Now we just know what's best for Il Divo. It's easy. Everything's easy. CNN: How are you being received in America? Miller: I think in America it's more of a slow burn. I think it's more difficult to put us on the radio because we fall between the cracks in a way. We're a little bit too pop for the classical stations, we're a bit too classical for the pop stations. And right now hip-hop and rap sort of reign supreme on the airwaves. But there is a big following and it's growing all the time. CNN: If there was someone you could collaborate with who you haven't yet, who would it be? Izambard: Beyonce. Christina Aguilera. Marin: Tina Turner. CNN: These are all pop acts. So you really do want to stay within the pop realm? Buhler: Yeah, definitely. I mean that's a very conscious choice. I don't think we're all opera purists, but for me personally, a ""Nessun Dorma"" [Puccini aria] is as good as it is and I don't see the point of adding a breathy voice, or adding harmonies to it. While the pop repertoire ... it's just more out there for everyone to take it and do with it whatever without offending people. All you want to do with a pop song is somehow transmit emotion. So far there's [been] much more freedom in pop music and that's why we stay in there ... we pretty much can do whatever we want.

"(CNN)  -- James Dobson, the influential evangelical leader of the Christian ministry Focus on the Family, has stepped down as board chairman, he announced Friday. James Dobson is expected to stay in his public role as an advocate for socially conservative issues. During a meeting with employees, Dobson, 72, said the move means he will no longer be involved with the administrative side of the organization, according to spokesman Gary Schneeberger. But Dobson's public role isn't expected to change. He'll still appear on his daily radio broadcast and as an advocate for socially conservative issues, Schneeberger said. ""There won't be a whole lot of difference,"" the spokesman said. ""You'll still hear him on the radio. You'll still see him on the networks like CNN with Larry King. ""He said to the staff today, 'I've got more to say -- I'm not ready to stop fighting for the things I've fought for for the past 32 years.' "" Founded in 1977, Focus on the Family is a nonprofit organization devoted to what it considers Christian family values, with Dobson's daily program geared largely toward advice on parenting from a religious perspective. But in recent years the ministry, like Dobson himself, has become more active in promoting social and political views. Last year, Dobson caused a huge political stir when he announced he ""cannot and will not"" vote for Republican nominee Sen. John McCain. He later changed his tune, after McCain's pick of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, calling her selection ""one of the most exciting days of my life,"" on the syndicated Dennis Prager Show. Dobson has gained widespread attention again with his criticisms of a 2006 speech by now-President Barack Obama on his religious views. He accused Obama of ""deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the Bible to fit his own worldview, his own confused theology."" That led to a backlash. A group of ministers started an online petition, James Dobson Doesn't Speak for Me, that drew more than 12,000 signatures. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of Houston, Texas' Windsor Village United Methodist Church, led that effort. ""Dr. Dobson has made a tremendous contribution to the spiritual and social fiber of this country. I've always said that and will continue to say it although, obviously, we have not always agreed,"" Caldwell said Friday. ""The fabric of the evangelical community here in America is very strong. One or two disagreements here and there are surely not going to cause the community to tear apart at the fringes."" Dobson has spoken out loudly against abortion rights and gay marriage and even weighed in on the Harry Potter fantasy series, with a statement on the group's Web site denouncing the books' ""trend toward witchcraft and New Age ideology."" ""He built his media empire around, sort of, parenting and family issues and he has since used his audience and his media presence to push a political agenda,"" said Peter Montgomery, a senior fellow with the liberal People for the American Way, which advocates, among other things, for the separation of church and state. ""In the last several election cycles, he's constantly complained that the Republican Party isn't far enough to the right and sort of has a habit of saying he's going to take his followers and walk if they don't do more to push his agenda,"" Montgomery said. Focus on the Family says its broadcasts reach more than 220 million people in 155 countries. Its newsletter, in which Dobson will continue to write, goes to 1.6 million people. Dobson's announcement that he and his wife, National Day of Prayer Chairwoman Shirley Dobson, are stepping down from the board of directors comes six years after he resigned as the ministry's executive director. ""One of the common errors of founder-presidents is to hold the reins of leadership too long, thereby preventing the next generation from being prepared for executive authority ...,"" Dobson said in a written release. ""Though letting go is difficult after three decades of intensive labor, it is the wise thing to do."" Montgomery, whose group has been critical of what it calls an ""assault on Americans' liberties"" by Focus on the Family, said it's unclear how influential the group will be when Dobson is no longer its public face. While Dobson is the personality that drives the ministry, Focus on the Family has a vast communication and fundraising infrastructure that could continue to make it a player in social and political issues for years to come, he said. In the meantime, Montgomery said, he doesn't expect Dobson's influence to wane because of the behind-the-scenes changes. ""He's still a rock star among conservative religious activists,"" he said.","NEW: ""He's still a rock star among conservative religious activists,"" scholar says .

"(CNN) -- Five members of Liverpool's backroom staff have followed manager Rafael Benitez in committing their long-term futures to the Premier League title challengers. Rafael Benitez's backroom staff have followed his example in signing new contracts with Liverpool. Benitez signed a new contract with the club last week, following months of speculation, keeping him at Anfield until 2014.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Paying for sex with trafficked or exploited women would become a crime under new laws proposed by the UK government Wednesday. Under proposed laws, it would be illegal to buy sex from a trafficked or exploited woman in the UK. The act of purchasing sex is not currently a criminal offense in England and Wales -- although there are laws against paying for sex in a public place and persistently soliciting prostitutes. Now UK Home Secretary (interior minister) Jacqui Smith says she is proposing the new measures to protect vulnerable women and tackle the demand for prostitution. Britain's interior ministry, known as the Home Office, introduced the new measures Wednesday after a six-month review that looked at what else the government could do to protect women being exploited for sexual gain. ""I want to do everything we can to protect the thousands of vulnerable women coerced, exploited or trafficked into prostitution in our country, and to bring those who take advantage of them to justice,"" Smith said in a statement. Smith said the new measures will shift the focus onto sex buyers because they create demand for prostitution and demand for the trafficking of women for sex. ""There will be no more excuses for those who pay for sex,"" she added. As part of the review, the government looked at the experience of other countries including Sweden -- which has criminalized paying for sex -- and the Netherlands, where brothels are licensed. The government estimates around 80,000 people are involved in prostitution in Britain, with about 4,000 women having been trafficked for sexual exploitation. It says the prostitution market nationwide is worth up to £1 billion ($1.52 billion). Trafficking is the movement of women from one place to another for the purposes of sex. British Authorities have said trafficking usually involves the trafficker promising to bring a woman to Britain for a better life and then forcing her into prostitution. The measures -- which must be approved by Parliament  -- would mean that those committing the new offense would be given a criminal record and fined £1,000 ($1,520) -- even if it was a person's first offense and the offender did not know the prostitute was being controlled by a pimp or had been trafficked. Police would also be given powers to close and seal premises suspected of being used for sexual exploitation, such as brothels, which the government said will prevent further exploitation and abuse from taking place. Current law prohibits curb crawling, which involves soliciting prostitutes from a motor vehicle persistently or in a manner that causes annoyance to the neighborhood. It also prohibits ""persistent soliciting,"" which is essentially curb crawling without a car. But representatives of sex workers attacked the plans Wednesday, saying they will force prostitution further underground and make women more vulnerable to violence. ""It's going to really make it more difficult for men to use the sex industry, and it's going to mean that women are going to have to take more risks in order to earn the same money,"" said Cari Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the English Collective of Prostitutes. ""It's also going to drive it underground. It's going to increase the stigma."" Mitchell said the government's figures are inflated, and that most immigrant women working as prostitutes have not been trafficked and are working independently. The new measures, she said, confuse prostitution with trafficking and take the focus off those women who may be vulnerable. ""Of women who may be trafficked and forced, what they need is to be able to come forward and report to the police without any fear of being deported,"" Mitchell told CNN. The new restrictions on curb crawling won't end the practice, Mitchell said, but simply give prostitutes less time to weigh up any potential dangers before getting in the client's car.","UK government: Around 4,000 women trafficked in the UK for sexual exploitation .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday admitted he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Tom Daschle as his health and human services secretary, saying Daschle's tax problems sent a message that the politically powerful are treated differently from average people. President Barack Obama is interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. Daschle, the former Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate, withdrew earlier Tuesday as news that he failed to pay some taxes in the past continued to stir opposition on Capitol Hill. ""I think I screwed up,"" Obama said in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again."" Daschle had apologized Monday for what he said were honest mistakes, calling them an embarrassment. The series of errors included improperly reporting $15,000 in charitable donations, failing to list $80,000 in lobbying income due to what Daschle said was a paperwork error, and not reporting as income a car and driver loaned to him by a friend and business associate.  Watch Obama admit mistake » . Daschle recently filed amended tax returns and paid more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest for 2005 to 2007. Those tax issues, as well as questions over whether work he did after his stint in the Senate amounted to lobbying, gave critics ammunition to question Obama's call for a change of culture in Washington. ""Ultimately, I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom-up politics,"" Obama said. ""And I don't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes.""  Watch the full interview with Anderson Cooper » . Obama defended Daschle's original appointment, saying ""nobody was better-equipped to deal both with the substance and policy of health care."" ""He understands it as well as anybody, but also the politics, which is going to be required to actually get it done,"" Obama said. Earlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs insisted Daschle's decision to withdraw was made on his own, not as a result of any prodding from the administration. In a written statement, Daschle acknowledged the political problem he had created for the administration. Still, Obama insisted the mistake was his.  Read how CNN analysts assess the situation » . Obama also said he's going to crack down on businesses using taxpayer money to excessively pay executives. He plans a Wednesday announcement of mechanisms to keep that from happening. ""I'm going to be talking about executive compensation and changes we're going to be making there,"" he said. ""We've now learned that people are still getting huge bonuses despite the fact that they're getting taxpayer money, which I think infuriates the public.""  Watch Obama discuss getting tough on executives » . The president also spoke about the struggling economy, the use of the label ""war on terror,"" and lighter topics, including the family dog and his efforts to stop smoking. Thinking about the nation's faltering economy keeps him up at night, Obama said. He also addressed criticism that there is too much spending in the current stimulus package bill written by House Democrats. iReport.com: Was Daschle properly vetted? ""Look, the only measure of my success as president when people look back five years from now or nine years from now is going to be, did I get this economy fixed. I have no interest in promoting a package that doesn't work,"" Obama said. Cooper also asked Obama about reports that he is not using former President Bush's phrase, ""war on terror,"" to refer to the wars in Iraq in Afghanistan. ""Words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds,"" Obama said. ""I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations, but that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community.""  Watch Obama talk about the phrase ""war on terror"" » . Moving on to lighter topics, the president said the first family hasn't decided what type of dog to get, but will wait until spring. Obama, an intermittent smoker, also said he has not smoked on the White House grounds. ""Sometimes it's hard. But, you know, I'm sticking to it,"" Obama said. iReport.com: 'People should give him some slack' Asked about the greatest lesson he'd learned about the presidency from studying about Abraham Lincoln, Obama said: . ""You know, when I think about Abraham Lincoln, what I'm struck by is the fact that he constantly learned on the job. He got better. You know, he wasn't defensive. He wasn't arrogant about his tasks. He was very systematic in saying, 'I'm going to master the job, and I understand it's going to take some time.' ""","Obama tells CNN's Anderson Cooper: 'I take responsibility for it'

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British adventurer has overcome sea sickness to complete his around the world trip relying only on the goodwill of people using social networking site Twitter. Paul Smith poses in New York in a picture posted on his Flickr page. Paul Smith aimed to travel to Campbell Island in New Zealand, the opposite side of the planet to his home in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in 30 days. In the end he fell just short -- reaching Stewart Island at the foot of New Zealand's South Island. There was not another boat to the more southerly Campbell Island -- a UNESCO World Heritage site -- until November. During his trip Smith visited the Netherlands, France, Germany and the U.S. -- where he was given a free flight to New Zealand -- and had his photo taken with Hollywood actress Liv Tyler.

"(CNN) -- Let's face it, if you're on holiday in Miami you'll want to be based near the beach, which, fortunately, is where the city's most glamorous hotels are located. South Beach is known for its Art Deco hotels, like The Delano, left. South Beach is known for its distinctive Art Deco hotels, mostly built in the 1920s and 30s and often painted in bright pastel colors. South Beach's Art Deco originals have been protected since the 1970s, and many have since been renovated to the highest specifications. Collins Avenue is home to more than its fair share of boutique hotels. The Delano (1685 Collins Avenue, doubles from $400) dates back to the 1940s and is crowned with streamlined fins that are pure Deco. It has been re-imagined by Ian Schrager, with a white, minimal Philippe Starck-designed interior that is sophisticated and hip. The Delano's Rose Bar is one of the best places in town for a poolside cocktail. The Shore Club (1901 Collins Avenue, doubles from $300) is another Schrager revival of a Deco hotel and, if anything, it's even cooler than The Delano. Rooms are high-tech, welcoming and often occupied by visiting celebrities. The attached sushi restaurant Nobu is top notch and the stylish Skybar, with its four bars and tropical gardens, is one of the city's hottest nightspots. Do you have a favorite hotel or place to stay in Miami? If you've just won the lottery, you'll want to stay at the Setai (2001 Collins Avenue, doubles from $785). Another conversion of an Art Deco hotel, albeit augmented by a 40-storey tower, the Setai adds tasteful Asian influences. Its cool, dark interior is a refreshingly tasteful oasis among the South Beach excess, and is both unashamedly luxurious and frighteningly expensive. Back in the real world, The Standard (40 Island Avenue, Miami Beach, doubles from $250) is a little stranded in its Biscayne Bay locale, but is great value. The real draw is the superb spa, with its infinity pool and open-air mud lounge. But this is no austere health retreat; it's relaxing and fun, and all the better for it. This is Miami after all... A cheaper, quirkier option is Pelican (826 Ocean Drive, doubles from $200). Owned by Italian fashion label Diesel, this is a colorful, kitschy place, with individually themed rooms, such as the ornate and floral 'Power Flower' room. The hotel's Pelican Café has an outstanding wine list and is surprisingly good value. Away from the beach altogether, the Biltmore (1200 Anastasia Avenue, doubles from $310), over in Coral Gables, is an absolute gem. The rooms aren't exceptional but the building is a beauty, modeled on the Giralda bell tower in Seville, with ornate Moorish-inspired touches. Al Capone was a big fan back in the 1920s and these days there's a massive pool, an 18-hole golf course and rumors of resident ghosts... ...................... Miami City Guide: .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Kansas are looking for a boy who disappeared about a decade ago, but was not reported missing until a few weeks ago. Adam Herrman has not been seen since 1999, when he was 11 or 12. ""We don't know what happened to Adam Herrman past '99, when he was last seen,"" Butler County Sheriff Craig Murphy said at a news conference in El Dorado. ""Is he alive, is he dead? That one I can't answer because we don't know,"" he added. Adam was 11 or 12 when he was last seen, Murphy said. At the time, he was living in a mobile home park in Towanda, a small town in southern Kansas, with his adoptive parents, Doug and Valerie Herrman. The couple did not report him missing, Murphy said. A few weeks ago, a person notified Sedgwick County Exploited and Missing Children's Unit of a ""concern"" regarding Adam, Murphy said. The agency did not immediately return CNN's phone call seeking additional information. Wichita attorney Warner Eisenbise, who is representing Adam's adoptive parents, said the couple ""really rue the fact that they didn't"" report the boy missing. ""They feel very guilty"" about not doing that, he said in a telephone interview. The couple told him the boy had run away frequently, he said, and they believed him to be either with his biological parents or homeless. Although the Herrmans did not report him missing, ""they were very worried about him,"" he said. Authorities have searched the Pine Ridge Mobile Home Park, where the family had lived, and discovered an ""answer"" to one of their questions, Murphy said, without explaining. ""We did find one of the answers we were looking for, but I am holding that one very tightly,"" he said. Eisenbise said authorities also executed a search warrant on December 15 at the Herrmans' home in Derby, a town just outside of Wichita. They took the couple's computer, he said. Murphy said the couple is cooperating and had not been charged with anything. Citing a relative, the Wichita Eagle reported the Herrmans had taken Adam into foster care and later adopted him. Michelle Ponce of the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, which oversees adoption and foster care, said she could not release any details regard Adam's case, and could confirm only that he had been in foster care at some point, but was no longer in foster care in 1999. Adam had been placed in the Herrmans' care when he was about 2, Murphy said in a phone interview. He had been named Irvin Groeninger III when he was born on June 8, 1987, Murphy said, and it was not clear when his name was changed. His biological parents relinquished their rights as parents about two decades ago, and Adam and his siblings were put in different foster homes, CNN affiliate KWCH reported. ""I thought what I was doing for them was in the best interest of the children and evidently it wasn't,"" Irvin Groeninger told KWCH. ""If he was still in my custody this would have never happened."" Adam's sister, Tiffany Broadfoot, 22, said she last saw her brother about 14 years ago at a birthday party. A year or two later, he sent her a Christmas card, she said. ""And that was the end of my contact with him,"" she told KWCH. ""He had the cutest little round face, little bitty freckles right up here on the tip of his cheek,"" she remembered. ""I'm just awestruck as how something like that could actually happen, and how he could be missing as long as he's been and nobody say anything,"" she said. Murphy said Adam's name appears on a legal document later than 1999. ""We know that he was listed in a legal action as if he was still living at home, and I'm not certain of the date, but it was beyond 1999,"" he told CNN.","Sheriff says no trace of Adam Herrman found after 1999 .

"(CNN) -- An elderly American man has been released from a Mexican jail more than two months after the grandson he was traveling with was arrested on child pornography charges, a family member said. Edward Chrisman, left, crosses the Mexican border back into the United States after being freed Saturday. Edward Chrisman, 88, and his grandson had traveled to Algodones, Mexico, for discount dental care, as a part of a growing trend known as medical tourism. Algodones is just across the border from Yuma, Arizona. The grandson, 40-year-old Gary Chrisman Jr., remains in a Mexicali jail awaiting trial, according to his cousin, Tracy Short. Authorities accuse him of offering a woman money to take nude photos of her teenage daughters. Child pornography charges can carry a penalty of up to 12 years in prison, according to officials from the Consulate General Tijuana. In early January, the Chrismans stopped at a convenience store in Mexico and Gary Chrisman went inside to purchase soft drinks. Edward Chrisman waited in the car, Short said. The younger Chrisman had been taking pictures of the area that day and, while in the store, approached a woman about snapping some shots of her teenage daughters. He offered to pay them $25, they agreed, and he took a few pictures of the girls' faces. It was at that point, the family says, that the girls' mother demanded more money from Chrisman and called local authorities alleging that Chrisman had tried taking pornographic pictures of her daughters, after he refused to ante up. Both men were taken into custody at the time, but the police report does not say why the elder Chrisman was arrested. The Chrisman family says the men were set up as a ploy for money. Since early January, the family says, they have paid thousands of dollars to at least three attorneys for legal representation and have reached out to numerous officials and politicians in Mexico and the United States for help. Edward Chrisman, who lives in Arlington, Washington, but was wintering with his grandson in Yuma, Arizona, was released from jail on Saturday and crossed the border back into the United States the same day. The family says his health had been steadily deteriorating while he was behind bars. Traveling abroad for health care is a phenomenon known as medical tourism. Many do it to save money or to get medical care not approved in the United States. Internationally recognized hospitals in Thailand and Singapore can often perform orthopedic and heart procedures at a fraction of the cost. Mexico is a popular choice for dental care. The estimated number of Americans seeking treatment overseas annually varies widely, but starts at a half-million people. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","U.S. man, 88, was arrested in January along with his 40-year-old grandson .

"(CNN) -- Germany's much-loved model train manufacturer, Maerklin, has filed for bankruptcy, leaving fans around the world wondering whether it's the last stop for the company's toy business. This Maerklin train has a video in the front so users get a driver's view. Maerklin has been building toy trains for nearly 150 years and its railroads made their way into countries as far away as Australia and New Zealand. The company said it applied for insolvency proceedings Wednesday after talks to secure credit from banks broke down. Despite intensive negotiations, the commercial banks did not extend their lines of credit, Maerklin said. ""It is sad,"" shopper Frank Steen, 39, said at London's famous Hamleys toy store. ""With fewer older brands around, all we're left with is Japanese plastic."" Although Maerklin generated a turnover of around $165 million in 2008, it struggled to obtain a credit extension beyond January 31, it said. Despite financial difficulties, the company still planned to set up its stall Thursday at the Nuremberg Toy Fair. Railway devotees will have plenty to look forward to after Maerklin boss Dietmar Mundil promised to bring 400 new products to the show.","Maerklin toy train firm files for bankruptcy .

"(CNN) -- More than 60 years after reneging on a promise to the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who fought for the United States during World War II, the U.S. government will soon be sending out checks -- to the few who are still alive. Veteran Franco Arcebal says, ""we are loyal to the United States, except that the United States has forgotten us."" ""For a poor man like me, $15,000 is a lot of money,"" said 91-year-old Celestino Almeda. Still, he said, ""After what we have suffered, what we have contributed for the sake of democracy, it's peanuts. It's a drop in the bucket."" During the war, the Philippines was a U.S. commonwealth. The U.S. military promised full veterans benefits to Filipinos who volunteered to fight. More than 250,000 joined. Then, in 1946, President Truman signed the Rescission Act, taking that promise away. Today, only about about 15,000 of those troops are still alive, according to the American Coalition for Filipino Veterans. A provision tucked inside the stimulus bill that President Obama signed calls for releasing $198 million that was appropriated last year for those veterans. Those who have become U.S. citizens get $15,000 each; non-citizens get $9,000. ""I'm very thankful,"" said Patrick Ganio, 88, the coalition's president. ""We Filipinos are a grateful people."" Ganio was among the tens of thousands of Filipinos at the infamous battle of Bataan, a peninsula on Manila Bay opposite the Philippine capital. He was captured and beaten by Japanese troops before ultimately being freed, suffering from malaria and then resuming his service to the U.S. military. ""The record of the Philippine soldiers for bravery and loyalty is second to none,"" Truman wrote to the leaders of the House and Senate in 1946. ""Their assignment was as bloody and difficult as any in which our American soldiers engaged. Under desperate circumstances they acquitted themselves nobly."" Though Truman said the Rescission Act resulted in ""discrimination,"" he signed it. ""There can be no question but that the Philippine veteran is entitled to benefits bearing a reasonable relation to those received by the America veteran, with whom he fought side by side,"" he said. ""From a practical point of view, however, it must be acknowledged that certain benefits granted by the GI bill of rights cannot be applied in the case of the Philippine veteran."" Some historians say financial concerns were paramount: The cost of funding full veterans benefits to all those Filipinos, particularly in the wake of the costly war, would have been a heavy burden. The National Alliance for Filipino Veterans Equity offers a different explanation. ""In 1946, discrimination against people of color was the rule of law,"" the group says in a document it submitted to the Obama-Biden transition team in November. ""The second-class treatment of Filipino World War II veterans is another example from this historical period."" For decades, Filipino activists and their supporters have fought for the full benefits. They've petitioned and picketed. Almeda, a widower who now lives in Virginia with his daughter, once chained himself to the fence outside the White House. ""I was fined $50 for civil disobedience and was arrested,"" he says now, chuckling. He says he was just looking for answers. Despite encouraging words from U.S. presidents, including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, the benefits were never restored. ""Only 70,000 Philippine veterans remain alive, and they hope to stay alive long enough to see those benefits reinstated,"" CNN reported in 1997. ""There's a bill, stuck in committee in Congress, that would do just that."" That effort, just like so many before, fell apart. ""We were loyal to the United States. Even up to now, we are loyal to the United States, except that the United States has forgotten us in many ways,"" said Franco Arcebal, another leader of the American Coalition for Filipino Veterans. ""It's only now, because of the insistence of Sen. [Daniel] Inouye in the Senate, he was able to act on this."" Inouye, D-Hawaii, inserted the language in the stimulus bill, calling it ""a matter of honor."" The honor comes too late for the many Filipino veterans who passed away waiting for this moment. Families of deceased veterans are not eligible to receive the money. For those who are alive, the checks could make a real difference. ""Practically all of us are below the poverty line now at this age. We have no way of earning a living,"" Arcebal said. But, he emphasized, ""it does not correct the injustice and discrimination done to us 60 years ago. ... We were not granted school benefits. We were not granted hospital benefits. ... And in the 60 years, several billion dollars were saved by the U.S. government for not paying 250,000 of us. ""Now we are only 15,000. And the amount that they're giving us is a small amount. But we appreciate that. Because it will finally recognize our services ... as active service in the armed forces of the United States."" CNN's Lisa Sylvester contributed to this report.","Filipinos were promised full military benefits to enlist .

"(CNN)  -- Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to octuplets in January, brought two of her babies home from the hospital late Tuesday. Nadya Suleman walks outside her new house for a video crew in La Habra, California, on March 10. She brought the infants to her new house in La Habra, California. Members of the media and gawkers crowded the cul-de-sac, as news helicopters hovered overhead. Media swarmed the family's vehicle as it slowly made its way through the crowd, into the home's garage. The babies discharged from the hospital were Noah Angel, known as Baby A, and Isaiah Angel, known as Baby C, according to the Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center. The medical team that delivered the babies identified them by letters of the alphabet. On discharge, Noah weighed 5 pounds, 13 ounces, and Isaiah weighed 5 pounds, the hospital said in a news release. ""Both infants are able to bottle feed, are gaining weight and are able to maintain their body temperature,"" the release said. ""This is a happy moment for everyone -- the family, physicians, nurses and entire NICU (neonatal intensive care unit staff),"" the release quoted neonatologist Mandhir Gupta as saying. ""It is always rewarding whenever a premature infant goes home as a healthy baby.""  Watch as crowd welcomes babies home » . The remaining six babies continue to progress well at the hospital, Kaiser said. All continue gaining weight as they get formula or donated breast milk. Hospital representatives made several home visits before the babies were discharged, to determine whether Suleman could provide safe housing, enough child care support and the supplies needed to care for the first two children, Kaiser said. Until recently, Suleman had been sharing another home with her parents and her other six young children. But that house ended up at risk of foreclosure, and Suleman moved into her own home. Last week, she disputed news reports that her father had bought the new house. ""I earned it. ... No, my father did not purchase this house for me. I did it on my own,"" Suleman told Radar magazine's Web site during a recent video tour of the 2,583-square-foot house. ""It's 1,000-square-footage bigger than the old house,"" she said on the video. ""They [her older children] like it more than Grandma's house."" Watch Suleman take other children to theme parks . Showing the new house to Radar, Suleman toured the living room, dining room and kitchen, and a den off the kitchen that she said she planned to turn into a nursery. All the cribs will be kept in that room and two babies will share each crib, she said at the time, ""unless one is sick, because they are so strong and healthy right now. ... Six are ready to come home."" Suleman, 33, added that they would come home two at a time. ""Two are little and they need to gain weight, and that's it. There's no medical problem,"" she said. People.com reported that their new home, which was listed for $564,900, has four bedrooms and a large back yard. ""My ultimate goal is not to be a burden on ... taxpayers,"" she told Radar. ""So there have been a couple of offers. ... I selectively picked a couple of opportunities to earn some resources for the kids."" Suleman gave birth to the octuplets through in-vitro fertilization, fueling controversy. News of her collecting public assistance for some of her children also outraged many taxpayers.","NEW: Babies are Noah Angel, known as Baby A, and Isaiah Angel, known as Baby C .

"(CNN) -- They've sung his praises on social networking pages, calling him a ""hero,"" ""the greatest man of our time,"" ""a legend."" They've said he deserves to be knighted and should be decorated with medals. They've cried out for his amnesty and have even proposed serving time for him. A Lebanese student in Beirut attends a December rally to support the shoe-throwing Iraqi journalist. The man many hundreds of thousands of Facebook users honor is no other than Muntadhar al-Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist who was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison for hurling his shoes at then-U.S. President George W. Bush. The double-whammy size 10 shoe toss, neither of which hit Bush, took place in December at a news conference in Baghdad, Iraq. In many traditional Middle East circles, throwing shoes at someone is considered a grave insult. To do this to an American president surrounded by Secret Service agents, no less, was as shocking to riveted viewers who watched the footage later as it was to the president himself.  Watch video about the shoe thrower's sentencing » . ""First of all, it's got to be one of the most weird moments of my presidency,"" Bush said later. ""Here I am getting ready to answer questions from the free press in a democratic Iraq, and a guy stands up and throws his shoe. ... I'm not angry with the system. I believe that a free society is emerging, and a free society is necessary for our own security and peace."" Expressing their own freedom on Facebook, a worldwide fan base rose up to laud al-Zaidi's actions. They formed hundreds of fan pages and groups, big and small, serious and light. One is even called the ""Shoe-Throwing Appreciation Society."" Mike Trainor, 28, was watching a football game when a news break brought footage of the incident across his TV screen. ""I thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen,"" said Trainor, a Queens, New York, stand-up comedian behind ""Guy Who Threw His Shoes at Bush,"" which has attracted nearly 270,000 fans. The comedian may have created the post for laughs, but he quickly learned how loaded the issue was. ""It grew into this crazy thing,"" in which Bush supporters began to weigh in on message boards calling al-Zaidi supporters ""a threat to America"" and insults in reaction flew, he said. ""It shows people have a lot of passionate feelings about it, that's for sure."" One message board on his page, titled ""YOU GUYS HATE AMERICA,"" drew 384 posts in reaction. The creator started it with these words: ""seriously you guys are all a**holes. why would you be happy about some freaking foreigner throwing his shoes at the leader of the free world? I don't care if he's dumb he's my president of my wonderful country [sic]."" And interspersed amid the groups of fans were those that spoke out against the al-Zaidi worship. ""That shoe thrower is not a hero,"" attracted 94 members, many of them with Arabic names. One London poster said the shoe thrower ""did nothing but bring shame upon us iraqis [sic],"" and another from Halifax, Nova Scotia added, ""I dont care about bush but this guy was very disrespectful to the Iraqi Prime minister who was standing right next to him [sic]."" But the shoe-thrower fans, at least in the world of Facebook, seem to far outweigh those who decried his actions. ""This site is intended to express the appreciation of those who share the frustration and anger that you expressed when you blew Mr Bush those boot-kisses [sic],"" reads the description on ""Thank you Muntadhar al-Zaidi,"" a nearly 500-member page created by a teacher at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Protests of the journalist's arrest and now sentence brought Arab and Muslim demonstrators to the streets. But what Facebook has shown is that al-Zaidi's angry expression resonated with those beyond his religion and region. From England and Uruguay to China and Bush's own red, white and blue, supporters have made noise, at least virtually. ""We're talking about a common man, like me and you,"" who was ""tired of years of lies from a self-called 'freedom saver,' "" said Matteo Ferigo of Padova, Italy, the 30-year-old creator behind ""Save Muntadhar al-Zaidi,"" which has 116 members. ""I understand that his act was not so civil, polite or 'politically correct,' but I also understand how Iraqi people can see George Bush and what he represents to them."" Ari Vais, the creator of the page, ""Free the Iraqi shoe throwing journalist!,"" said his own history taught him the value of free expression. ""I was born in the Soviet Union, where dissent like this was cracked down on severely,"" said Vais, a 39-year-old Queens, New York, musician. ""We came to America when I was a boy because we knew that people should be free."" What al-Zaidi did was a reflection of the democracy Vais thought Bush intended to spread. ""We were supposed to be liberators, and what America stands for is freedom of self-expression and human rights,"" he said. ""All he did was throw a couple shoes. And he missed! It was political theater and not jail-time stuff."" But it was serious business. Anyone, no matter where they live, would be tackled by Secret Service and face charges for such an attempted assault on the president. And if al-Zaidi had done this to Saddam Hussein, one has to wonder what would have come of the man who's now celebrated. The shoe throwing, because it was so shocking, proved great fodder for late-night talk shows. Comedians, beyond Trainor, had a field day with this one. It inspired online games for people who wanted to play al-Zaidi. Matt Love of Edmonton, Alberta, in Canada called the Iraqi journalist's move ""an act of great courage"" and said that in showing his disdain for Bush, ""He spoke for many millions of people."" The 52-year-old retired Washington state department of transportation worker believes everyone can learn from the shoe thrower. Commenting Thursday on several fan pages, including one calling for a Nobel Peace Prize for al-Zaidi, Love suggested that people turn out for Bush's March 17 speech at the TELUS Convention Centre in Calgary. ""Lets [sic] show some solidarity...and lob some loafers,"" he wrote. ""Will the Canadian government lock us up for 3 years? Let's find out."" Reached later in the day, however, he assured CNN that this was written tongue-in-cheek. ""Let me be clear,"" Love said. ""I won't be throwing shoes at anyone.""","Muntadhar al-Zaidi, who threw his shoes at President Bush, gains cult-like following .

"(CNN) -- The only thing Venus Williams treasures more than winning is a decent nap. Venus Williams knocks Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova out of the  Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships on February 17, 2009. Just before a match, when other top tennis players might be psyching themselves up for a three-set onslaught, the elder of the Williams sisters can be found somewhere private, snoozing. ""I'm always sleepy,"" she told CNN in an interview for this month's edition of ""Revealed."" ""I'm literally taking a nap during the first set and the match before me, so I'm probably the only person that can go to sleep, come out 15 minutes later and start playing."" Wary of sending the wrong signals to her rivals, the sixth seed confessed to CNN that she prefers to take her naps in private. ""I'm wondering if my competitor is going to see me here, so I try to act like I'm not asleep, but I am asleep, or I try to find a place where I can sleep in and no one will see me,"" she laughs. The lightning-fast speed of Venus' serve is at complete odds with her personality. She is strong, ambitious and determined, but also surprisingly laid-back for someone whose professional career is about playing harder, longer and faster.  Watch Venus Williams on ""Revealed."" » . ""I just always go with the flow,"" she told CNN. ""On the court, that's when I get most intense. In practice, I scream and yell and threaten to throw my racquet but in the match I'm not like that at all."" Her younger sister, world number one Serena, sounds almost envious of Venus' ability to keep her emotions in check. ""Venus is really, really unusually composed and that's just her style,"" Serena told CNN. ""On the court she's always really focused. She always has this quiet tenacity and she never really shows her emotions which I think is good."" The youngest of five sisters, Serena says she continues to draw inspiration from her closest sibling. Venus is just 15 months older than Serena. She set the marker for success in 2002 when she became the first of the sisters to become world number one. Serena first took the title in July of the same year and reclaimed it earlier this month. ""She's my bigger sister, she's my older sister, she's a role model for me,"" Serena said. ""I'm always trying to do what she does. If she's going on the right path then I'm going on the right path too. If she's working hard then I want to work hard also. I'm the little sister who wants to be just like the big sister,"" she added. If they once struggled to find the required ruthlessness to eliminate each other from a competition, it is clearly no longer a problem. Of 18 matches they have contested, each sister has won nine. At the time of writing, there is every chance they will meet again this week in the semi-final of the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. They last clashed at the Sony Ericsson Championships in Doha in November 2008 when Venus dispatched Serena in three hard-fought sets before going on to win her first end of season title. Watch Venus take the title . Asked after the match about accusations they don't play as hard against each other as they would normal rivals, Venus replied, ""You have to play hard against a Williams or you are going home quickly. We try our hardest and I think that everyone knows that by the effort level."" Their mother, Oracene Price, told CNN she keeps her advice on the subject simple. ""I just tell them to remember they are sisters and how love and how to care for one another is more important than anything,"" she said. ""So, this is just a game and eventually it would be over and you will have to live with each other. So, just go out there and do your best and whoever wins, wins. And whoever loses, better luck next time."" Having said that, Price admits she keeps her distance from whoever comes out second best, in any match. ""They don't want to be talked to, they don't want you telling them anything, they just want to be left alone and that's what I do,"" she told CNN. There was no need for tip-toeing after the second round of the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. Venus made fast work of Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, beating the 17-year-old 6-0, 6-1 in less than one hour. Venus told CNN her ambition this year is to topple Serena to become the world number one. ""I think I am in a great position to do that,"" she said.

"Editor's note: Actor Rainn Wilson plays paper salesman Dwight Schrute in the television comedy ""The Office."" Rainn Wilson says fellow members of his Baha'i faith are being persecuted in Iran. (CNN) -- Why is Rainn Wilson, ""Dwight"" on ""The Office,"" writing a news commentary for CNN? Good question. It's a bit strange for me, to say the least; a comic character actor best known for playing weirdos with bad haircuts getting all serious to talk about the persecution of the fellow members of his religious faith. Dear readers of CNN, I assure you that what I'm writing about is no joking matter or some hoax perpetrated by a paper-sellin', bear-fearin', Battlestar-Galactica obsessed beet farmer. I am a member of the Baha'i faith. What is that, you ask? Well, long story short, it's an independent world religion that began in the mid-1800s in Iran. Baha'is believe that there is only one God and therefore only one religion. All of the world's divine teachers (Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Moses, Abraham, Krishna, etc.) bring essentially the same message -- one of unity, love and knowledge of God or the divine. This constantly updated faith of God, Baha'is believe, has been refreshed for this day and age by our founder, Baha'u'llah. There. Nutshell version. Now, as I mentioned, this all happened in Iran, and needless to say the Muslim authorities did not like the Baha'is very much, accusing them of heresy and apostasy. Tens of thousands were killed in the early years of the faith, and the persecutions have continued off and on for the past 150 years. Why write about all this now? Well, I'm glad you asked. You see there's a 'trial' going on very soon for seven Baha'i national leaders in Iran. They've been accused of all manner of things including being ""spies for Israel,"" ""insulting religious sanctities"" and ""propaganda against the Islamic Republic."" They've been held for a year in Evin Prison in Tehran without any access to their lawyer (the Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi) and with zero evidence of any of these charges. When a similar thing happened in 1980, the national leadership of the Iranian Baha'i community disappeared. And this was repeated again in 1981. In fact, since 1979, more than 200 Baha'is have been killed, holy places and cemeteries desecrated, homes burned, civil rights taken away and secret lists compiled of Baha'is (and even Muslims who associate with them) by government agencies. It's bad right now for all the peace-loving Baha'is in Iran who want only to practice their religion and follow their beliefs. It's especially bad for these seven. Here's a link to their bios. They're teachers, and engineers, and optometrists and social workers just like us. This thought has become kind of a cliché', but we take our rights for granted here in America. Imagine if a group of people were rounded up and imprisoned and then disappeared not for anything they'd done, but because they wanted to worship differently than the majority. There is a resolution on the situation of the Baha'is in Iran being sent to Congress. Please ask your representatives to support it. And ask them to speak out about this terrible situation. Thanks for reading. Now back to bears, paper and beets! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rainn Wilson.","Rainn Wilson: I'm a member of the Baha'i faith, founded in the 1800s in Iran .
He says the faith has been persecuted on and off for 150 years .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- The death toll from a flash flood in Indonesia's capital grew to 98 people on Sunday as rescuers widened their search for more than 130 other people in the aftermath. Members of a search and rescue team look for bodies near  Jakarta. The nation's health ministry said 62 women, 31 men and three students had been killed. Of those, 12 bodies remained unidentified, ministry spokesman Rustam Pakaya said. Another 13 people were missing. The search for the missing will be called off Sunday night, he said. The flood started Friday morning after heavy rains caused waters to smash through a dam and rush into Jakarta.   The breach unleashed a torrent of water that plowed into hundreds of homes in what some survivors described as a suburban ""tsunami."" About 1,500 volunteers -- mostly students from two flooded universities in Jakarta -- are assisting in the search and rescue effort, said Mardjito, a social affairs ministry official who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name. He said rescuers started using heavy machinery to lift debris. Still, the death toll is expected to rise. At least 50 people were injured and nearly 1,500 have been displaced. Mardjito said a camp for survivors so far has adequate supplies as members of political parties continue to send food, blankets, flashlights and other items amid a major election year. Sleeping residents were taken by surprise by the powerful flash flood as it crashed through the crowded Cirendeu district near Jakarta early Friday.  Watch scenes of the flood devastation » . Drenched and shivering survivors were taking refuge on the rooftops of their homes as rescuers in rubber boats were struggling to reach them, said social affairs ministry official Mardjito. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, currently on the campaign trail ahead of the elections later this year, has said he had ordered senior ministers to visit the scene of the disaster. ""On behalf of the government, I express my condolences to the families of the dead victims and may their souls be accepted by God almighty,"" he said, according to the official Antara news agency. The rain obliterated a 255-meter-long section of the dam, releasing a wall of water from a 20-hectare lake that some survivors said reminded them of the tsunami that hit Indonesia in 2004. ""They said they had heard loud rumbling sounds like during a powerful earthquake. They later found out that the sounds came from the water rushing out from the dam's lake,"" according to Antara. Floods from heavy rains are an annual occurrence in and around Jakarta, a low-lying city on the northern coast of Java island, where poor infrastructure often results in polluted canals and rivers overflowing their banks and spilling into thousands of homes. In 2007, 38 people were killed and 430,000 forced from their homes when storm water 3 meters deep in some places swamped 75 percent of the capital, which is home to about 9 million people. With poor sanitation and a hot and humid climate, the risk of water-borne diseases is usually a major concern following floods in the city, where mosquito-transmitted malaria is also a threat. CNN's Andy Saputra contributed to this report.","At least 98 dead, many more missing, from flash floods in Jakarta .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The ""crime scene cookies"", ""baaji custard"" and ""sponge shafts"" depicted in Oliver Beale's letter of complaint to Virgin Atlantic struck a chord worldwide. Mean cuisine? Airline industry experts insist standards of in-flight food are improving. The missive he sent to Virgin chairman Sir Richard Branson about a meal he received on board a Virgin flight from Mumbai to London in December spread across the web and email with a vengeance. Not only was this a complaint letter par excellence, but it hit upon one of the most emotive subjects of long-haul air travel: the in-flight meal. Read the letter here. ""Food gets everybody going, whether they are sitting at the back end or the front end of the plane,"" says Peter Miller, marketing director at Skytrax, a UK-based aviation research organization. ""Apart from the sheer fact you might be hungry, it is there to alleviate the boredom. Because of that people tend to focus on it more."" But the criticism passengers target at airline food is not always warranted, Miller argues. Skytrax has been tracking airline service for a decade and every year it ranks airlines according to catering in economy, business and first class. Miller acknowledges that there have been cut backs on catering across short-haul flights and a decline in spending on food in long-haul economy. But Skytrax's research has also revealed a general improvement in standards over the last five years. ""We are actually strong supporters of the overall quality that is served up across most airlines in most parts of the world,"" says Miller. Standards have improved firstly as a result of greater competition between airline catering companies, says Miller. What do you think? Are in-flight meals getting better or worse? What was your worse meal? Sound off below. Austrian catering company DO & CO has transformed the food served onboard Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines flights. Skytrax reported a 35 percent increase in customer satisfaction for Turkish Airlines since DO & CO was hired in 2007. ""In the last 15-20 years, the industry has focused on lean production. But we believe [airline catering] is not the job of a car manufacturer,"" says Attila Dogudan, CEO of DO & CO. Good quality airline food not only depends on the quality of raw ingredients, he says, but also the intangible elements of good cuisine. ""If you have chefs doing 3,000 filets on the grill, after 300 they lose the passion,"" says Dogudan. To inspire enthusiasm in its kitchens, DO & CO says it employs an unusually high ratio of chefs to work on a greater variety of dishes. They say they also insist on training cabin staff in food service; they replace the dreaded disposable food trays with crockery; and give passengers menus explaining where their fresh, local ingredients come from. Airlines also use food as a marketing tool and improve standards to attract premium customers. Austrian Airlines has won the Skytrax award for Best Business Class Catering for the last two years. As Michael Braun, spokesman at Austrian Airlines says, ""the current situation in the airline industry is tough and costs have to be cut. But the competition is also very tough, so we need something that makes us unique compared to other airlines."" And for Austrian Airlines, one unique selling point is its food. There is an on-board chef on every Austrian Airlines flight who puts the crucial finishing touches on premium-class meals. The airline also offers a ""Vienna coffee house in the air"" and one quarter of flight attendants are trained sommeliers to guide passengers through the extensive wine list. Airlines worldwide also hire celebrity chefs to add prestige to their culinary efforts. British chef, Gordon Ramsay is one of Singapore Airline's ""Culinary Panel""; Juan Amador works with Lufthansa; and United Airlines enlisted the services of U.S. chef Charlie Trotter to inspire its in-flight menu. Chefs help airlines design meals that perform at high altitude. As Michelle Bernstein, Delta's celebrity chef has said, palates weaken in pressurized air cabins, which means dishes need to be made a more flavorful and seasoned than they would be on the ground. Miller at SkyTrax is skeptical about the true benefits a celebrity chef can bring to onboard catering. After all, Gordon Ramsay isn't actually in the cabin sautéing the potatoes. But he does acknowledge that some chefs have influenced a new style of in-flight cuisine. Chef Neil Perry, hired by Qantas in 2003, initiated a move to healthy eating in first and business class. His work has since influenced standards across catering in all classes. Qantas won the Skytrax award for Best Economy Class Catering in 2008 partly as a result of simple enhancements such as the availability of fresh fruit between meals and from the self-serve bar in economy on its A380 aircraft. But as airlines grapple with a deepening recession, can passengers expect treats to vanish from food trays? Across short-haul flights, making cuts is an ""easier game,"" says Miller. Passengers notice it far less if an airline switches a sandwich for a packet of biscuits and a plastic cup of coffee, he says. But on long-haul flights, airlines are restrained in what they can cut. Miller: ""People measure the standard of their flight by the quality of the food or the size of the portion they get. If a meal is cut back too severely they are going to walk away."" How important is food for you on flights? Is it good enough? Sound off below.","In-flight food has been the butt of much criticism for the airline industry .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- John and Elizabeth Calvert enjoyed the good life on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, friends said, but they were growing more and more suspicious of the way their business books were being handled. Things weren't adding up. Money appeared to be missing. John and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. So they scheduled a meeting with accountant Dennis Ray Gerwing to address their concerns, recalled one close friend, Nancy Cappelmann. The Calverts said they were meeting with Gerwing at his offices in the upscale resort community at 6 p.m. last March 3, she added. It would be the last time anyone would see or hear from the couple. The Calverts lived part-time on their yacht, docked at the island's Harbor Town Yacht Basin, the same marina where they managed boat slips. They spent the rest of the year in Savannah, Georgia, and also had a home in Atlanta. They were an active, affluent couple in their mid-40s, and their absence was quickly noticed. On the evening of March 3, 2008, the evening they were to meet with their accountant, both of the Calverts' phones were turned off. Family members said it was very unusual for either John or Elizabeth Calvert to shut off their cell phones.   Watch an update on the case » . Family and friends called police and reported the Calverts missing on March 4, after they missed appointments and still couldn't be reached. ""I was supposed to meet John that night and he is never late, so when 20 minutes went by, I got worried and called his cell, but it went straight to voicemail, like it was turned off,"" Cappelmann said. She was a good friend of the couple's and worked at one of their harbor businesses. Police and search teams scoured the island. Divers and dogs searched the harbor and found nothing. The Calverts' small airplane was still at the island's airport and provided no clues. Their 2006 Mercedes Benz was found parked at a hotel in Palmetto Dunes, a gated community six miles from where the Calverts' yacht was docked. The Mercedes also contained no forensic clues. In reconstructing the Calverts' last days, investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look. They now say they believe the 54-year-old accountant was the last person to see the Calverts alive. Gerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts' four businesses on Hilton Head Island. Authorities were already looking into possible financial improprieties involving the company, The Club Group. They named Gerwing as a person of interest in the case about a week after the couple disappeared. An internal audit later revealed that Gerwing had embezzled $2.1 million from the Calverts and others, police said. Gerwing committed suicide within hours of learning he was a person of interest, slashing his neck and legs with a steak knife, authorities said. He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case, said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J. Tanner. Tanner said the notes indicated some acknowledgement of responsibility for his actions, but didn't say specifically what those actions might have been. Police also gathered circumstantial evidence that seemed to point to Gerwing, including drop cloths large enough to use to wrap bodies and latex gloves purchased on the day the Calverts disappeared. In addition, police learned that Gerwing's cell phone had been turned off for 12 hours after he was scheduled to meet with the Calverts. If Gerwing were alive, Tanner said, police wouldn't have enough corroborating evidence to name him a suspect and arrest him. Police executed search warrants on Gerwing's office, home and vehicles and found soil in Gerwing's kitchen. Investigators hope analysis of the dirt might provide clues to the origin of the dirt and a new location to continue searching for John and Elizabeth Calvert. Friends and family are offering a $65,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the Calverts' disappearance.

"(CNN) -- Kellee Santiago wants to tap into the kinder, gentler side of gaming. The player takes flight in ""Cloud,"" a video game distributed by thatgamecompany. The president and co-founder of thatgamecompany is finding success in the video game industry with titles like ""Flower,"" ""Flow"" and ""Cloud."" The mellow interactive experiences are definitely different from the more violent ""spray-and-slay"" video games on the market and are designed to encourage emotion, innovation and creativity. In ""Flower,"" the player journeys through an imaginary landscape where they can blow breezes, collect flower petals and enjoy the colorful landscape of what Santiago says is a ""video game version of a poem."" Such creativity seems to be in perfect harmony with the 30-year-old video game developer, who has a background in the performing arts. A graduate of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, Santiago worked with incorporating digital and interactive media with live performance before she discovered another passion. It was while completing a master's in fine arts at the Interactive Media program at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts that Santiago realized she could marry her love of the arts with video game creation. ""That attraction I had to working on original theater works was very similar,"" she said. ""I had grown up with video games; I was definitely a gamer all my life, and I had just never thought about it as a creative medium. ""As soon as I did, it was just really exciting, because I saw this huge, untapped potential and a lot of things that hadn't been done before,"" she added. ""That excited me."" While at USC, she worked on a student project called ""Cloud,"" a downloadable PC game, which only a few months after release online had been played by 350,000 people. ""In comparison to every single play I probably ever worked on in combination never saw that large an audience,"" said Santiago, whose company released ""Cloud"" as one of its games. ""That was really exciting."" Santiago is returning to her alma mater Monday as a speaker for TEDx USC, an independently organized TED event, which has CNN.com as one of its supporters. TED stands for technology, entertainment and design and began 25 years ago as a conference to bring together some of the world's greatest minds. Krisztina ""Z"" Holly is vice provost and executive director of the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation as well as the curator of TEDx USC. She said USC is an ideal location for the event, which has a theme of ""Ideas Empowered,"" because of its diverse, entrepreneurial and innovative environment. ""It's a great opportunity to bring together leading minds both from on-campus and off-campus to share ideas, to hear new ideas and be inspired to come up with their own ideas to make a real impact,"" she said. Making an impact is exactly what Santiago had in mind when she and fellow USC graduate Jenova Chen launched thatgamecompany. The company, though small and independent, has received many positive reviews of its games and last year was honored as one of the ""20 Breakthrough Developers"" of the year by Gamasutra. Two of its games have been released on the Sony PlayStation 3 platform. Although the gaming industry is mostly dominated by men, Santiago said, she has always been treated as an equal among her peers. And although the main demographic for video games is young men, Santiago said, there is another audience. ""The average gamer now is 35 years old,"" she said. ""Because the audiences are maturing and simultaneously we have a generation of people who've grown up with games who are entering the industry, it's sort of now our turn to create."" Scott Steinberg, publisher for Digitaltrends.com and author of ""Get Rich Playing Games,"" said Santiago is one of several women making a splash in the world of gaming. Steinberg said Santiago, who is also an invited speaker at the Game Developers Conference this week in San Francisco, California, has achieved a level of visibility because of the quality of her work and the fact that she is a great game designer. ""These are games that push boundaries that appeal to folks of all ages, interests and genders,"" he said. Santiago's games stand out, he said, because they differ so greatly from what many think of when they think video games. ""That's part of what makes them so appealing is the fact that the offer something so different,"" he said. ""They are unique, something audiences haven't seen before. A lot of them actually border on being virtual art experiences more so than video games. ""The nice part about it is, they can be consumed at a very leisurely pace; they can be consumed in bite-sized sessions,"" Steinberg added. ""These are the types of titles that we need as an industry to help broaden our horizons."" Santiago remembers her first experience playing video games on an arcade version of ""Super Mario Bros."" that she and her brother tackled while her mother shopped at the supermarket. And although she says she doesn't think it's dangerous for children to play violent video games, Santiago does see danger in doing so without having recognition of the violence. From her games, she says, she wants players to take away the feeling that, like with any communicative medium, there is a relationship with a game. ""One of the questions we always get is, are we always going to make emotional games,"" Santiago said. ""We are saying all games are emotional.""","Kellee Santiago's company produces video games meant to inspire .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- When Anna Elisa Fattori arrives at work the first thing she does is to take off her clothes. All of them. For Fattori is a professional nude model working at Rome's art academy. Anna Elisa Fattori: ""You are trying to give inspiration to the students."" ""It is a tough job!"" she tells me just before beginning to pose for a group of students, eager to paint her gracious figure. There is something striking about her bright green eyes and wavy red hair. ""It doesn't seem to be hard, but you know, try it! Put yourself in front of the mirror and then stay for a long time in a pose. You start: 'Oh my back, oh something is strange here...'"" she says, mimicking pain on her lower back. Fattori is one of about 300 people in Italy who do this job, but only about 50 of them have full-time contracts. She makes the equivalent of about $1,500 each month, but only works three months per year. And that is why she and others recently went on strike, demanding a full-time wage for work they say not everyone can do. ""It is not easy because you are naked, so you have to be very comfortable with your body and have a nice relationship with everybody,"" she says as the students look on, ""but not too open and not too close. You are trying to give inspiration to the students. If we lose these artistic roots that are very important to Italy then we lose a big part of our identity."" Italian Renaissance art is filled with naked men and women: Think of Michelangelo's David or Botticelli's Venus. But back then artists mostly used prostitutes and lovers as models and muses, often with the complicity of priests who wanted the walls of their churches painted by famous names. ""Priests allowed prostitutes to use churches,"" explains Enrico Bruschini, one of Rome's best known art historians. ""Officially it was to convert them, but the practical reason was to have the artist at the church."" Bruschini says that the Saint Augustine church, a stone's throw from Piazza Navona, was a famous gathering point in Rome for Renaissance artists looking for ""inspiration."" Back then though professional modeling did not exist, and most would agree that the art didn't really suffer from its absence. So if Botticelli and Raphael could do without professional models, what is the big deal now? ""It all started with the rise of art schools in the 19th and 20th centuries"" says Fattori. ""During the Renaissance you just thought that a prostitute can be a model or even a lover. But now we are here, so we need to move ahead."" Art students hoping to become the next Michelangelo agree. ""I think a person should have talent,"" argues Anastasia Kurakina, a first year student from Russia. ""Because you, for example, you couldn't [model]... I don't know you, but Anna Elisa has talent."" Anastasia is right, I certainly couldn't do it -- but unbeknownst to me she used me as a model while I was interviewing Fattori. Thankfully I was fully dressed, so all she drew was my head. And she didn't to a bad job at that. E-mail to a friend .","Italy's art models have gone on strike, demanding they get a full-time wage .

"(CNN) -- As the first president-elect with a Facebook page and a YouTube channel, Barack Obama is poised to use the Internet to communicate directly with Americans in a way unknown to previous presidents. Since the election, President-elect Barack Obama has posted weekly video addresses on YouTube. Judging by Obama's savvy use of social-networking sites during his campaign and the interactive nature of his transition team's Web site, Americans can expect a president who bypasses the traditional media's filters while reaching out to citizens for input, observers say. ""The rebooting of our democracy has begun,"" said Andrew Rasiej, founder of Personal Democracy Forum and the techPresident blog. ""[Obama] has the potential to transform the relationship between the American public and their democracy."" During the presidential race, Obama's campaign won praise for its innovative use of social-networking sites, including Facebook, MySpace and MyBarackObama.com, to announce events, rally volunteers and raise money. Facebook has more than 150 million active users, and the average user has 100 friends on the site, according to the company. iReport.com: Your chance to ask President-elect Obama a question . Obama has more than 1 million MySpace ""friends"" and more than 3.7 million ""supporters"" on his official Facebook page -- some 700,000 more than when he was elected in November. His campaign also has a database of almost 13 million supporters and their e-mail addresses. Transition officials hope to transform Obama's vast Web operation and electronic list of supporters into a 21st-century tool to help accomplish his goals as president. They even have a name for this ambitious effort: Obama 2.0. ""Obama has invented an alternative media model,"" said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ""In the old model, the president talks to the people on television [and] the people talk back in polls. In the new model, communication is online, and two-way."" Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and Twitter didn't exist when George W. Bush took office eight years ago. But since last November's election, Obama has wasted no time embracing these online communication portals. In recent weeks he has taped weekly video addresses and posted them to YouTube, where most have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Obama's staffers also have stopped posting information to social-networking sites since the election, preferring to reach out to constituents through YouTube and Change.gov, the official site of the president-elect's transition team. Visitors to Change.gov can read a frequently updated blog, post their ideas on issues facing the country, and rate others' ideas. Top-rated ideas will be gathered into a briefing book and given to Obama after he takes office. ""They want information going not just from them to the voters, but from the voters back to them,"" Democratic strategist Steve McMahon said Wednesday on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""Thirteen million people pushing a button, sending an e-mail to their elected representatives, making a phone call, taking action, is a powerful, powerful lobbying tool."" ""It's a very smart use of the Internet, to get people to offer ideas,"" said David All, a Republican Internet strategist. All hopes that Obama and his staff take a similar approach to WhiteHouse.gov, the president's official Web site. The current WhiteHouse.gov site, operated by the Bush administration, contains few interactive features. A statement on the president-elect's transition site says that Obama hopes to ""use cutting-edge technologies to create a new level of transparency, accountability, and participation for America's citizens."" It's fitting, then, that Obama's inauguration next week could be one of the most watched video events in Internet history. Rasiej expects that hordes of users will be watching online when Obama takes the oath of office, visiting WhiteHouse.gov and refreshing their browsers to capture the moment the site switches to proclaim Obama, not George W. Bush, as president. As president, Obama will likely not just rely on WhiteHouse.gov but use multiple Internet sites and technological tools to build grass-roots support for his agenda, observers say. ""[Obama] is using the tools that are available to him today,"" All told CNN. ""The next president will be using some of the same tools, and also some tools that haven't been invented yet.""","As president, Barack Obama will use the Web to communicate directly with citizens .

"(CNN) -- From songs to poems to sayings on the side of coffee cups, everyone tries to define love in words. Liz Kelly donated her kidney to her fiance after he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. But often, it's the extraordinary actions we take in the name of love that really define it. Liz Kelly's fiance, Matt House, needed a kidney after he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. In order to get him to the top of the donor list, Kelly signed up to donate hers. At first, she never dreamed she would actually be a match, but it turned out she was. The Springfield, Massachusetts, couple (he's 31, she's 29) spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about whether Kelly thought fate played a hand in finding him a donor match. The following is an edited transcript of the interview: . Nicole Lapin: Liz, I didn't know about the donor process, until we started talking to you guys. The donor process works whereby a friend or a family member can donate a kidney to get Matt higher on the list, so you decided that you were going to do that. Why did you decide to do that?  Watch Nicole Lapin's interview with Liz Kelly and Matt House » . Liz Kelly: It was pretty much a no-brainer, I think. His sister was actually going to donate at first. But she didn't work out for health reasons. It's obviously better to have, you know, a family member donate a kidney, too. But since that wasn't going to work out, his stepfather stepped in because they were the same blood type. And that ended up not working out either. He had some heart issues and some other health issues. So, I said, you know what, I'll just donate to the list. And that's what I was intending on doing. And then I found out that we were actually a match, and it was amazing. Lapin: It was amazing, I'm sure, to get that phone call, because you did it just so that you could get higher on the list. A lot of people on our Web site are fascinated by your story, guys. [A viewer] has a question for you right now, Liz: Have you ever had any surgeries before this one? If not, how did your prepare yourself for this? Kelly: No. This was my first surgery, so that definitely made me very nervous. That was the definitely scariest part for me, just not knowing what to expect. But, Matt has been through several surgeries before. So I know I had him in my corner. And I looked up a lot online. I found out a lot of great information online. So that's definitely how I prepared. Lapin: And [another viewer] has a question in for Matt, actually: Were you scared that perhaps your body might reject Liz's kidney or were you always confident that the surgery would be a success? Matt House: I think I was pretty confident with her being the same blood type or us matching is pretty phenomenal, so I didn't expect it to reject it anyway. Maybe after the surgery if I would have a little pain down there or something like that, I would get a little nervous and think that it was going to reject, that there's something wrong. But that would just pass. It was me just being a little overanxious, I guess, but not really, no. I was pretty confident everything would go well overall. We're both pretty healthy for the most part. And being the same blood type was just you know really great, so it worked out good. So, I wasn't really worried at all. Lapin: Fate, some may say? House: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Lapin: Yours is a lot bigger. You're a little girl, but you happen to have a kidney that is perfect for Matt. Do you think it was meant to be? Kelly: I do. I definitely do. People tell me that all the time. When they told us that we were a match, I was very surprised at first, but then I thought about it a little more. Of course we were a match. How could we not be a match?","Liz Kelly offered to donate kidney to move her ill fiance higher on donor list .

"(CNN) -- An Australian pilot landed a company plane in the ocean off Darwin on Friday, in a water landing that prompted comparisons to last month's landing of a US Airways jet in New York's Hudson River. The Australian pilot has been compared to U.S. hero Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, pictured above. The Australian pilot also encountered problems shortly after takeoff. The twin-propeller plane was carrying the pilot and five passengers when it went down shortly after leaving Darwin International Airport, said Neville Blyth, a senior transport safety investigator with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. All those aboard were unhurt and managed to walk to shore, he said. Pictures showed the men from the plane soaked and carrying bags and equipment as they walked through the water. ""It's essentially a good story,"" Blyth said. The ATSB is deciding whether to investigate, he said, and the cause of the incident is still unknown. The Piper Chieftain plane was on its way to the town of Maningrida, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Darwin, according to its owner, Australian information technology company CSG. Watch the plane ditch in Darwin Harbor » . ""We would like to congratulate the pilot following all emergency landing and evacuation procedures and his very professional handling of the situation,"" a CSG statement said. Darwin is in Australia's Northern Territory, on the coast of the Timor Sea. The city's airport is near the water. The plane's trajectory took it over the water, giving the pilot limited opportunities to ditch the plane on land, Blyth said. He said the ocean was a safer option for landing than the beach, where the firmness of the sand was unknown. ""Personally, I think the decision was appropriate,"" Blyth said. Australian media dubbed the captain of the Darwin plane ""Sully Lite,"" comparing him to the captain of the US Airways Airbus jet that landed safely in the Hudson. Pilot Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger was hailed as a hero for landing the plane safely and ensuring that all 155 people on board survived. Asked about the comparisons, Blyth said the connection was tenuous. ""The correlation for a water landing is as close as it gets,"" he said.","Australian pilot lands a company plane in the ocean off Darwin .

"(CNN) -- Normally, ""hot spot"" isn't the first phrase that comes to mind when talking about Saskatchewan, Canada. A relocation service company president said he is moving more people to Saskatchewan than ever before. But with most of Canada suffering from devastating job losses, this cold province is becoming exactly that. It's an asterisk to the entire country when it comes to the economic climate, and Premier Brad Wall is shouting it as loud as he can. ""It's a great time to come to Saskatchewan,"" said Wall, who even called the Toronto Star newspaper to tout his province's economic success and let Ontarians know there were jobs for the taking. ""For those who are losing their jobs, we need them to know we have thousands of jobs open right now in both the private and public sector,"" Wall said. ""We have a powerful story to tell, a story of success and that's something we want to share with those who are struggling."" Wall's province is one of the exceptions to the unemployment increases battering provinces across Canada. Saskatchewan's unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in January from 4.2 percent in December, making it the only province recording a decline. In Ontario and the city of Toronto, unemployment rates rose to 7.2 percent and 8.5 percent respectively. To the west, British Columbia shed 68,000 full-time jobs in January. More Saskatchewan jobs should be on the way. To stave off any possible recession, Wall announced a $500 million infrastructure ""booster shot"" to help keep the economy strong.   Learn more about different towns in Saskatchewan » . ""All across the country, industries are getting quite ill,"" Wall said. ""We aren't immune to it. We see some impacts in terms of layoffs and new vehicle purchases slowing off, and so we want to be proactive in staying ahead of the curve."" On Tuesday, the Conference Board of Canada released a report that said Saskatchewan will likely continue to lead the nation in economic growth in 2009 because of the infrastructure investment and tax reductions. The province has also been reaping the benefits of an influx from nearby Alberta. When the government in Alberta decided to raise the oil royalty rates, oil exploration and expedition companies decided to move their operations to Saskatchewan in hopes of making more money. With the province's growing opportunities, David Montgomery, president of Calgary's Qwest Haven Relocation Services, said he is moving more people to Saskatchewan each day. ""Alberta has always been the gravy train of oil,"" said Montgomery, who is also a former resident of Regina, the capitol and second-largest city in Saskatchewan. ""But with the new royalties, oil companies are saying 'Why stay here and make less when the opportunities right next door are even better?' Many other companies may start to follow suit."" Montgomery said people looking to move have said that cheaper land and insurance prices are among the other reasons they are headed to Saskatchewan. ""There, government insurance is cheaper than anywhere else in the country and it comes with your license plates,"" he said. ""With the amount of jobs, cheaper opportunities and great way of life, the government there has made it very attractive to move there."" That means more business for Wall's province and more jobs coming to the area. Not that there's a shortage of jobs. On Tuesday night there were nearly 6,000 private- and public-sector jobs on the Web site Saskjobs.ca. A constant stream of revenue from oil production and exports also buoys the economy in the province. Saskatchewan falls just behind Alberta, as the largest oil exporter in Canada, and Wall's province sends more oil to the United States than Kuwait. Wall said the province is the leader in uranium production and produces a third of the world's potash. The province continues to keep ahead of the curve, Wall said, finding ways to diversify its resources and embark on ambitious green projects and new oil projects. The province is working with Montana on a $212 million climate change initiative that would create the first major greenhouse gas storage project in North America. The carbon dioxide from coal-fueled power plants would be stored in the ground in Montana and later be withdrawn for use in oil production. Wall also said what may be the largest discovery of sweet, light crude oil in the southeast part of the province means it could have even more oil to work with. The Bakken Formation could potentially have 413 billion barrels of oil, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That would be another huge untapped revenue gold mine. Despite the growth of nearly all sectors across the board, Wall cautioned that it is possible his province may see economic stress, just later in the game than other places. ""We need to be circumspect and prudent about promoting our province,"" he said. ""We are not immune; we do see the impacts. It isn't some sort of panacea or answer to economic questions that don't exist elsewhere. We are a bit of an asterisk that says there is some stress, but it's relatively calm here."" Wall encouraged people not to count out a move to the province based on stereotypes that it is ""only winter here,"" and ""all of the land is just rolling hills."" ""'It's a beautiful, big place where life is great and right now there's also opportunity,"" he said. ""I'm very, very biased, but I can't imagine a place I'd rather be, especially with what's going on economically around the world.""","Saskatchewan projected to lead Canada in economic growth in 2009 .

"LINKENHOLT, England (CNN) -- Hidden away in the hills of Hampshire lies the village of Linkenholt. This idyllic community, home to just 50 people comes complete with grand Edwardian manor house, cricket pavilion and grounds, blacksmith's forge, rectory, shooting grounds, 22 houses and grade 2 listed cottages. The current owner has ensured that houses are not sold off in the near future. It's all one could ever want from a quintessential English village, and now it is on sale for $33 million. Once owned by English cricketer Herbert Blagrave, the estate was left to his own charitable trust which has now put the entire village -- church not included -- up for sale. ""That,"" joked local estate agent Tim Sherston, ""is owned by God."" In times of financial downturn and falling house prices, the decision to sell up is curious. The trust says though it wants to free up the capital tied up in the estate so it can give more to charity on an annual basis. Sherston maintains that Linkenholt is not only a rare opportunity; it is a sound buy. ""Big time investors will look upon it as a safe haven to place their money because in five years you're going to see a great deal of appreciation here, so this is perfect."" The new owner could also take away a significant income from the rent of the houses.  Watch as village goes on sale » . Likely buyers are private individuals interested either in farming or the shoot, regarded as one of the finest in the south of England, according to Sherston. There has also been some foreign interest though he adds ""the village is run very much as it has been for the last 200 to 300 years and it is the trustees' hope that the new owner will continue to run it in the same manner."" Provisions have been made by the trust to ensure the houses are not sold off in the near future. Only the manor house will be vacant for the new owner. But locals do worry about their new landlord. The village thatcher Paul Raynsford told CNN: ""I'd sooner not see a banker or someone who's going to asset strip it. I'd like to see a film star, pop star, footballer, someone who just wants to buy it so they can say 'I'm the lord of the manor.'"" Ray Smith, known locally as ""the Sheriff,"" has worked as the estate's manager for 50 years. He says: ""I'd like to see an Englishman live in the manor, run the farm and the shoot like it used to be."" Indeed, Linkenholt is idyllic; within the beautiful surroundings classified as an area of outstanding beauty, this is a village full of characters and local tales. Ray's wife Elsie talks of how they met as teenagers cycling past each other everyday on the way to work along the same path. Stopping one day to help with her broken bike, they have been together ever since. He made the permanent move to Linkenholt when the keeper before him caused a local scandal when caught illegally shooting the ground's deer. Two doors down lives Elsie's sister, who is married to Ray's brother. The sisters were born here, christened and later married in the church here, worked in the cricket club, and though their own children have moved further afield, they would never leave. Their father even died on Linkenholt's cricket ground during a game in the 1930s. Having dedicated their lives to the village, the Smiths and childhood friend Alan Dewey, another original local, were given the houses in which they live by the trust. Ray adds: ""I'm on holiday all the time. With a place like this to sit in the sun and look at all the views, I don't think you'd want to go anywhere else."" Though the media has shone a temporary light on Linkenholt, the hope after the arrival of the new owner is that the village will revert back to times of old, unspoilt and wonderfully English. Reiterating the ideal of having a new lord of the manor, blacksmith Colin Boast adds: ""We would like to see someone come in and take the village to their heart and to love it like the people here do.""","Village of Linkenholt, in southern England, up for sale for $33 million .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- At least 22 people were killed Friday in two bus bombings in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan security officials inspect the bus that was the target of the roadside bomb attack. Initially, police said 21 commuters were killed and more than 53 wounded when an explosion hit a crowded bus in a town south of the capital of Sri Lanka on Friday, police said. Police accused Tamil Tiger rebels of carrying out the attack in Moratuwa, a southern suburb of Colombo. Police said they also discovered and defused a Claymore mine in the same place, preventing another explosion. A few hours later a bomb explosion in a bus outside Sri Lanka's hill capital of Kandy killing one person, police said. The incident took place at Polgolla, some eight kilometres from the outskirts of Kandy where the bus was headed from the hill country town of Matale. Police also blamed Tamil Tiger rebels for that explosion. At Moratuwa, police and soldiers sealed off an area around the scene and searched for suspects. Authorities also intensified security in Colombo. Initial reports said an explosive device was placed on the ground and detonated with a remote control device, police said. In an adjoining town, another bomb was discovered and diffused immediately, they added.  Watch medics treat bus blast survivors » . The explosion came as rebel bomb attacks on civilian targets in Colombo and its suburbs have showed a marked increase.

"(CNN) -- American al Qaeda member Adam Gadahn appeared in a video posted on the Internet on Saturday, focusing on Pakistan, with references to the U.S. economic meltdown and fighting in Kashmir. Adam Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, is seen in a video posted on the Internet in August 2007. The rambling, wide-ranging video was released by www.LauraMansfield.com, a Web site that analyzes terrorism. The 32-minute video was produced by As Sahab, al Qaeda's video production arm. Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, is on the FBI's Most Wanted List, with a reward of up to $1 million for information leading to his capture. He was indicted in 2006 on charges of offering material support for terrorism and treason, making him the first American charged with treason since World War II. He has renounced his American citizenship. ""It's time for you to put aside tribal, ethnic and territorial differences and petty worldly disputes not just for now but forever and unite to restore the glories of your forefathers and hasten, Allah willing, the defeat of the Zionist-crusader enemy and the establishment of the Islamic state, the Ummah, the so eagerly anticipated,"" Gadahn says in English. Gadahn also notes that ""victory in Kashmir"" has been delayed for years, adding that, ""It is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which, Allah willing, will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land."" He also cited the economic woes in the U.S. economy. ""The enemies of Islam are facing a crushing defeat, which is beginning to manifest itself in the extending crisis their economy is experiencing. The crisis, whose primary cause, in addition to the abortive and unsustainable crusades they are waging in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, is they are turning their backs on Allah's revealed laws, which forbid interest-bearing transactions, exploitation, greed and and injustice in all its forms and demand the worship of Allah alone to the exclusion of all false gods, including money and power,"" he said. Gadahn, who grew up in rural California, embraced Islam in the mid-1990s and moved to Pakistan. Since October 2004, he has appeared in at least eight al Qaeda videos speaking in English and praising the terrorist network. In a video released in January, Gadahn renounced his U.S. citizenship and destroyed his passport on camera, saying, ""I don't need it to travel anyway."" His demands have ranged from pulling out all soldiers from ""every Muslim land"" to halting support of the ""enemies of Islam"" and freeing all Muslims in detention centers and prisons. Failure to take any one of the steps, he said, would be ""considered sufficient justification"" for continuing the fighting and killing. However, according to CNN Senior Arab Affairs Editor Octavia Nasr, no known terrorism activity has been linked to his messages.","Al Qaeda member Adam Gadahn appears in video posted on Internet on Saturday .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jessica Keenan tried on wedding dresses in a fancy Beverly Hills boutique, about 100 miles from the Santa Barbara, California, clinic where she gets blasted with chemotherapy once a week. Jessica Keenan, 34, is getting married January 24, thanks to the Dream Foundation. Keenan is 34 years old and battling Stage 4 breast cancer with faith, hope and a charity called the Dream Foundation, which helps terminally ill adults. ''You get a diagnosis and you never know how short your time is,"" Keenan said. ""I chose to believe there is going to be a cure. You still carry those dreams of getting married, having a kid."" But Keenan and her fiancé, Curtis Jimenez, couldn't afford a wedding -- their finances are sapped by her cancer battle. They rent from friends. Keenan wrote a letter to Dream Foundation, at the suggestion of her devoted nurses at the Santa Barbara cancer center. ""It all just started snowballing,"" she said. Her wish has been granted, thanks to Dream Foundation and flock of people she has never met. Think of the foundation as Make-A-Wish, but instead of trying to help desperately sick children, Dream Foundation assists terminally ill adults. Keenan's wedding is a different, more lavish wish than most of the requests the foundation has been receiving in this tough economy. ""People's needs are becoming basic,"" said the charity's founder, Thomas Rollerson. ""We are getting wishes just to pay an electric bill, pay the rent, or help keep a promise to go to Disneyland to give them that memory in a time of hopelessness, doctors visits and uncertainty."" Other dreams are simply for dying family members to be united with loved ones, last visits before last rites. Rollerson explains that with money tight, donors can still help without writing big checks. For example, people can donate frequent flier miles or hotel points. When corporate donors and philanthropists jump in, a Dream Foundation wish can turn elaborate. The foundation's Web site is a bulletin board of heartache looking for relief. There's Bruce, 31, dying of Hodgkin's lymphoma. He wants to leave New York state for the first time and take his wife and his 6-year-old son to Disney World. Remedios is a California woman with incurable cancer. She wants to treat the daughter who stands over her bed to a Quinceniera, a traditional celebration for a girl who turns 15 years old. Bone cancer is expected to kill Edward Lucas of Springfield, Missouri, in less than six months. He wants to celebrate his 21st wedding anniversary with his wife, Nancy, before he leaves her a widow with an adult daughter and three grandchildren. Their dream is a warm-weather honeymoon trip never taken. Edward was hospitalized and too weak to talk to CNN. ""I wanted him to have a trip or something to look forward to,"" Nancy said. ""A lot of people don't realize there are dreams for adults too."" The Lucas' dream trip is coming together with the help of Dream Foundation, which is hashing out some of the flight and hotel issues to Florida. Back in California, Keenan's wedding is speeding toward January 24, thanks to dozens of corporate sponsors and a wealthy Texas do-gooder, Beverly Adams, who made a big financial contribution. The upscale boutique Monique Lhullier donated the dress. ""We're a conduit,"" Dream Foundation's Rollerson said. ""People are willing to help. They just need to know how and where."" Keenan, a hairdresser by trade, was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. She thought she had it beat two years ago when she met her fiancé on New Year's Eve. She found out in March of 2007 the cancer returned. Her fiancé has remained at her side. ""When they met, they were just so into each other,"" said Lena Rueff, who first introduced the bride-to-be to her brother. ""He has been a rock for her. He packs snacks, games, books to the hospital where he stays with her."" In the dress shop, she and the other bridesmaids cheer for Jessica. ""You look sexy!"" Her hair is cropped short after all the chemotherapy. ""I like the long veil."" Jessica pauses, realizing she's not just playing dress-up with grade school friends. ""It's overwhelming. I'm anxious and excited,"" she said, standing in a room where some dresses cost more than new cars. ""I still don't believe it's going to happen."" The bridesmaids stop cheering for a second and rub away tears of joy.","Jessica Keenan, 34, has Stage 4 breast cancer .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A lawsuit filed January 30 by baseball great Roberto Alomar's ex-girlfriend alleges he engaged in unprotected sex with her while suffering from HIV/AIDS. Roberto Alomar's ex-girlfriend says he had unprotected sex with her while infected with HIV. Ilya Dall is asking for $15 million for ""personal injuries"" suffered due to Alomar's negligence. She and her two children lived with the former New York Mets slugger for three years. She alleges that he started exhibiting signs of HIV as early as 2005, but twice refused recommendations for an HIV test by his doctor, saying that earlier tests for the disease had come back negative, according to court papers. Alomar's lawyer, Charles Bach, was not available for comment, but attorney Luke Pittoni, who also represents Alomar, said, ""We believe this is a totally frivolous lawsuit -- these allegations are baseless, he's healthy and he'd like to keep his health status private. We'll do our talking in court."" Anthony Piancentini, who is representing Dall, said he has ""no comment"" at this time. Dall says in court papers that Alomar told her ""I don't have HIV."" She alleges he ""lied and purposefully misrepresented his physical condition"" and ""that he was endangering the health and well being of [Dall] by continuing to have unprotected sexual relations with [her],"" according to the lawsuit. Court papers list several physical ailments that Dall says Alomar exhibited from early 2005 on, including white spots on his mouth and throat, extreme fatigue, back and vision problems, and shingles. In early 2006, Alomar submitted to an HIV test that, according to court papers, confirmed he was HIV positive in February 2006. Dall says she went for an HIV test shortly afterward and the results were negative. The couple visited a disease specialist shortly after Alomar's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. Dall alleges that a few days later, Alomar's skin was turning purple and he was foaming at the mouth; a spinal tap on February 21, 2006, confirmed he had full-blown AIDS, court papers said. Dall claims in the lawsuit that Alomar's negligence caused her severe ""emotional distress"" over the health of her children. Court papers say that because the couple lived with the children, they may have been exposed to Alomar's saliva or blood in the bathroom, through things like toothbrushes and other items. Dall claims to suffer from ""permanent emotional distress"" even after repeatedly testing negative for HIV. The lawsuit claims her fear of contracting the disease is known as ""AIDS phobia"" and that she suffers from permanent post-traumatic stress disorder. Alomar requested Tuesday that the suit be moved to Brooklyn, New York, federal court. It was originally filed in Supreme Court in Queens, New York. An initial conference on the case is expected on April 15 in Brooklyn federal court. Alomar is the son and brother of major leaguers -- father Sandy Alomar was a second baseman with several teams between 1964 and 1978 and brother Sandy Alomar Jr. is a former catcher who played from 1988 to 2007. Roberto Alomar retired in 2004 with a .300 lifetime batting average, 12 All-Star game selections and 10 Gold Gloves. He was the All Star Game MVP in 1998 and played on two Toronto Blue Jays World Series champion teams. Alomar, then playing for the Baltimore Orioles, is also known for an incident in 1996 during a game against the Blue Jays when he spat in the face of umpire John Hirschbeck following a heated argument over a third strike. After the incident, Alomar claimed the umpire uttered a slur to him during the argument.","Ex-girlfriend says he denied having HIV/AIDS, had unprotected sex with her .

"Editor's note: Jordan Lorence is senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund, a nonprofit organization of Christian attorneys. He has litigated religious liberty and free speech cases since 1984, including the Southworth case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1999, involving mandatory student fees at public universities, and a 2004 case that resulted in a California Supreme Court ruling that marriage licenses issued by San Francisco to same-sex couples were invalid. Jordan Lorence says Rick Warren's views on marriage shouldn't bar him from Barack Obama's inauguration. SCOTTSDALE, Arizona (CNN) -- Proponents of redefining marriage couldn't wait for the new president to be sworn in before demanding that he erase from the inauguration ceremony a prominent American who disagrees with them. The target of their rhetorical bombardment is Rick Warren, the popular Christian pastor from Southern California. President-elect Barack Obama has asked Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration. Not so fast, cries Kathryn Kolbert, head of People for the American Way, an organization that claims to advance equality and freedom of speech and religion (but not for Rick Warren and those who agree with his marriage views) in a piece published on CNN.com. Warren's grave sin? Along with 52 percent of California voters, he supported California's Proposition 8, which affirmed the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. What a radical! Though Warren will only be praying for the country's future (not giving a speech about marriage), Kolbert and others are pressuring Obama to set a precedent for his administration of publicly shunning someone who supports the traditional definition of marriage. They want people like Warren silenced and ostracized for their ""hate speech,"" defined today as disagreeing with their agenda to impose a redefinition of marriage on an unwilling America. Obama, to his credit, has resisted their strident demands. The attacks on Warren are the latest in a series of coercive, intimidating attacks on supporters of traditional marriage. Now, activists have ramped up their strong-arm tactics by pushing the president-elect to ban Warren from appearing at the inauguration. This is amazingly audacious, in light of the fact that on marriage, the overwhelming majority of Americans and, indeed, humanity, agrees with Warren. Americans have voted to preserve marriage in all 30 states where it has been on the ballot by an average vote of more than 65 percent. The collective experience and wisdom of every major civilization from the dawn of time agrees that societies function best and children are best protected when marriage is defined as between one man and one woman. Warren and those who agree with him want all nations to experience these benefits of marriage when it is rightly defined and consistently practiced. Ironically, Obama has repeatedly stated that he agrees ""that marriage is the union between a man and a woman."" Does Kolbert question his fitness to serve as president in light of his allegedly ""bigoted"" views on marriage? Kolbert brazenly denies that she and other activists desire to silence pastors like Warren because of their marriage views. She is indignant that Warren and others spread the ""big lie"" that redefining marriage would threaten the freedom of speech and religious liberties of those who hold the view shared by the vast majority of Americans. Her argument is disarming in its pure duplicity. Part of Kolbert's case against Warren, who she thinks should not be speaking at such an important public ceremony, is that he believes that folks like her are working to ban people like him from speaking at public ceremonies. Thus, the ""big lie"" becomes an obvious truth. This is really all about ideological purity -- and purging. Are the activists proposing that no one should be permitted to speak at the inauguration if they hold beliefs on marriage contrary to hers and her ideological bedfellows? How can publicly snubbing the influential and respected Warren advance what Kolbert calls ""the values of unity and respect ... on which President-elect Obama campaigned?"" It won't. But it will surely send a message to those who believe in marriage, that they will be viciously attacked for expressing, or merely believing, that marriage is defined as between one man and one woman. Ms. Kolbert provides just the latest example of how the forces of ""tolerance"" and ""diversity"" quickly abandon their principles of ""live and let live"" when somebody disagrees with them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jordan Lorence.","Jordan Lorence: Barack Obama has asked Rick Warren to give the invocation .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Karma caught up with former Culture Club singer Boy George on Friday when a court sentenced the star to 15 months for falsely imprisoning a male escort, a court spokeswoman said. George O'Dowd, also known as Boy George, arrives at Snaresbrook Crown Court, in east London. Full details of the sentence weren't immediately clear. A jury unanimously found the pop star and DJ, whose real name is George O'Dowd, guilty of the charge last month after a seven-day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in northeast London. The jury determined O'Dowd, 47, had chained male escort Audun Carlsen to a wall at his apartment in London's hip Shoreditch neighborhood. Carlsen had also said the singer beat him with a metal chain.  Watch as Boy George arrives at court » . O'Dowd, who maintained his innocence, came to court Friday sporting a multicolored tattoo on his bald head, none of his trademark makeup, and a black winter coat. The star quit Culture Club in 1987 after a string of hits with the group, including ""Karma Chameleon,"" ""Do you really want to hurt me?"" and ""Church of the Poison Mind."" He has since become a DJ and revived his singing career, releasing a single last year called ""Yes we can,"" inspired by Barack Obama and featuring clips of the U.S. president-elect. O'Dowd is no stranger to the law. In August 2006, he spent five days cleaning the streets of Manhattan as part of a community service sentence for falsely reporting a break-in at his New York City home. He has also publicly battled drug addiction.","Former Culture Club singer jailed for falsely imprisoning a male escort .

"Editor's note: Carly Fiorina is chief executive of Carly Fiorina Enterprises and former chief executive of HP. She was an adviser to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign last year. Carly Fiorina says outrage at Wall St. pay is justified but salaries shouldn't be set by government. (CNN) -- Americans are outraged over excessive CEO pay and perks. That outrage is justified, particularly when American taxpayers are footing the bill. Our capitalist system works best when there is transparency and accountability. There has been too little of both on Wall Street. Inevitably, the president and Congress are now attempting to respond to taxpayer anger and restore some ""common sense,"" as President Obama recently declared, to CEO compensation. The proposed solution caps top executive pay at $500,000 for institutions that have received bailout money. I don't think this is the answer, although it is an understandable reaction. It's arbitrary: Why not $400,000 or $600,000? It's incomplete. It only applies to institutions that will receive more government assistance going forward. And it doesn't strengthen our economy when government decides how much each job is worth. In America we leave that job to markets. So what's the answer? To strengthen transparency, all aspects of CEO pay and perks should be fully disclosed on a regular basis. This should include airplanes, cars, golf-club memberships, bonuses, stock options, retirement plans and salaries -- in short everything that a common-sense person would consider part of a CEO reward package. See Fiorina discuss exec pay, including her own » . To strengthen accountability, all aspects of CEO compensation should be voted on by shareholders on an annual basis. Ultimately, it is the owners of a company who must determine whether a CEO's rewards are justified by a CEO's performance. And because the American taxpayer is now a partial owner in many companies, the government can get a vote as well -- in some cases a very sizeable vote. In addition, ""clawback provisions,"" which require a CEO to return compensation to shareholders if promised results aren't delivered, should be standard fare. Finally, when a company comes to Washington for American taxpayer money, it is an admission that mistakes have been made and major bets have failed. These CEOs should be prepared to tender their resignations and those of their boards. To earn a bailout, a CEO and board should be held accountable. We should not weaken our economy while trying to fix it. These are difficult times. President Obama has described our current situation as a ""crisis"" and an impending ""catastrophe."" In such times, action is required. The key is to take actions that help in the short-term, while also being sensible for the medium and long-term. Too often our politicians react to crisis and public anger by over-reaching, and they create new, unforeseen problems that only become clear with the passage of time. In this country, the opportunity to be rewarded for taking prudent risk is fundamental to our economic vitality and strength. Let's not lose that fundamental principle in our outrage over Wall Street greed and excess. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carly Fiorina.","Carly Fiorina: It's understandable that people are outraged at Wall St. pay .

"(CNN) -- The Indigo Girls navigate the challenges of today's recording environment with their new two-disc album, ""Poseidon and the Bitter Bug."" The Indigo Girls, Amy Ray, left, and Emily Saliers released their latest folk-rock album on Tuesday. Rather than abandon ship amid the country's economic recession and after being dumped by their former label, the folk-rockers decided to release the album independently -- and they recorded it in a mere three weeks. The veteran Atlanta, Georgia, duo remains optimistic about America's recording industry and the ability of artists to market themselves online. But nothing will replace a heartfelt live performance, said Amy Ray. ""We need to keep art as a visceral experience, too, and not just an Internet experience,"" said Ray, who plays in the group with Emily Saliers. It is ""going to be up to bands to keep touring and people to keep going to hear 'em.""  Watch their live performance and interview with CNN » . CNN talked with the Indigo Girls about the Internet, food, their Southern roots and their newest album's strange name. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: What's been the primary influence for you all? Has it been a place, like Atlanta? Or has it been something else? Emily Saliers: Atlanta and the South, just in general. ... Some of it comes through the content and some of it just comes through a vibe. We're sort of a hootenanny bar band. We cut our teeth in Little Five Points Pub, and what we always like to do is bring people up on the stage and jam with us. ... We tie it back to the days when people just sat on the porch and played together. It's a very Southern thing, an Appalachian thing. CNN: Tell me about the title for this album. Saliers: Mitchell Froom, the producer, came up with the title, and it was originally a joke. He said it and he laughed -- and we all laughed. Naming a record is probably one of the hardest things in the whole process, and that name just stuck with us. And it's also cool because ""Poseidon"" is a reference to a lyric in one of my songs, and ""Bitter Bug"" is a reference to a lyric in one of Amy's songs. So to be able to fit two of those pieces together in a way that works is cool. CNN: And you all are working as free agents on this [album]. Tell me about that. Amy Ray: We got dropped from the last label we were on, Hollywood, right before we were going to go into the studio, so we just kind of kept all of our plans in place and everyone that was going to be involved with us came to the table and gave us deals and made it work. ... Creatively we've always done what we want, but on the business level it's demoralizing when you feel like there's not a team anymore because the label you're on isn't really behind you or doesn't know what to do, or is kind of paralyzed by the industry, generally. CNN: What are you all listening to lately? Saliers: You know, I just bought yesterday -- I downloaded it -- Sean Lennon's last record. I saw him on some obscure Japanese channel when we were in some other part of the world and I really like the sound of that. And then this artist named Sia. She sang with Zero 7 and she's a really good artist, I like her stuff a lot. I like the Weepies. CNN: You [Emily Saliers] are a part owner in a restaurant here in Atlanta. ... Is there any kind of relationship between music and a good restaurant experience? Saliers: There definitely is! The name of the restaurant is Watershed, it's in Decatur [Georgia]. We're very fortunate to have Scott Peacock as our executive chef. ... He's a very decorated chef but he also makes Southern food -- good Southern food. It's kind of like what your grandmother would make if you grew up in the South: lots of lard and butter and comfort food ... I think the experience of sharing food is a lot like the experience of sharing music. It's just something that people's work goes into it and a lot of love goes into it, and then you share it together. CNN: I wonder what you make of Twitter and artists playing on Second Life and sort of all of these virtual personas that people have these days. Ray: I don't really have a judgment about it one way or the other. I have a lot of friends that delve into all that stuff and it doesn't stop them from being creative in other ways. I think it increases creativity and exercises a different part of your mind. ... My nieces and nephews, they're very involved in [the video game] ""Rock Band"" and stuff like that, which I think is really great because it's introducing them to music, but I just want them to go outside sometime, too. (laughs) That's all. Play in the woods a little bit. CNN: How has your collaboration changed over time? Saliers: The way that we collaborate hasn't changed that much. Amy writes her songs; I write my songs. We write totally separately but then since the very beginning we've come together to arrange songs. ... Over the years we've picked up a few more instruments, so texturally we're more expansive than we were when we were just two guitars at the very beginning. Now there's harmonica and mandolin and banjo -- a little bit of keyboard. We mix that up, but the process is pretty much the same.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For three years, family, friends and her college sorority sisters have been looking for Jennifer Kesse, wondering what happened to her. Jennifer Kesse would be 26 now. She has been missing since January 24, 2006. Last week, on the third anniversary of Kesse's disappearance, an inmate in a Florida prison said he might have the answer. David Russ, a convicted killer being held at the Seminole County Jail, spoke last week with the missing woman's father, Drew Kesse, claiming he had information that could lead to a break in the case. Details are being withheld from the public. In a jailhouse phone call with CNN, Russ hinted he'd eavesdropped on other inmates. He also was outspoken about his skepticism toward investigators. ""The investigators have messed this case up from the beginning and cannot be trusted,"" he said. That's why he asked to speak directly with the missing woman's father, he said. Orlando police are just as skeptical of Russ. They said he provided information they already had. ""His information is not some big break in the case,"" said Sgt. Barbara Jones of the Orlando Police Department. ""We are still hoping for new tips that could lead us to finding Jennifer Kesse."" The 24-year-old financial adviser was just back from a Caribbean vacation with her boyfriend and was getting back into her routine. She went to work at her new job, came home to her new condominium and called her parents.  Watch an update on the case » . At 10 p.m., she called her boyfriend, who lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Then, her family believes, she went to bed. The next morning, she got up and showered for work. Her clothes were neatly laid out on her bed, her family says, suggesting she may have tried on a few outfits before deciding what to wear to the office. Then, she disappeared, her family said. She did not show up for work that Tuesday morning and her employer reported her missing. Police found Kesse's Chevy Malibu two days later. It was parked in a gated lot about one mile down the road from the condominium complex where she lived. Inside the vehicle, police found some of Kesse's personal items, but her purse, wallet, two cell phones and briefcase were missing. The car doors were locked and the car keys were not found. Police later released a video surveillance tape of the car being parked in the lot by someone other than Kesse. The grainy video partially shows a person walking away from the car, past a parking lot gate. Police are uncertain if this person of interest is a man or a woman, because the image is partially obscured by the gate. The person is described as 5 feet 4 inches, with a short haircut, wearing light-colored clothes and dark shoes. The video is time and date-stamped at noon on the day Kesse disappeared. Forensic tests on the vehicle came back inconclusive, Sgt. Jones said. No blood or other trace evidence was found to show that Kesse had been injured in the vehicle. Drew Kesse said that every Tuesday, landscapers worked at the condo complex near his daughter's parking space. The landscapers said they didn't see Kesse leaving her apartment and getting into her car, which she did every weekday morning between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m. ""The only theory we could come up with is that she walked out her front door and was kidnapped somewhere between her front door and the parking lot where her car was. We think since the landscapers didn't see her, she must not have even made it out of the hallways or stairwells of the condo complex,"" Drew Kesse said. He added that there weren't any surveillance cameras in the hallways or stairwells at the time his daughter was living there. Sgt. Jones said investigators have developed forensic evidence from Kesse's car that could someday match with a person of interest and identify a suspect. Police have also released a photo of a green clover tattoo on Kesse's left hip. Anyone with information leading to Jennifer Kesse or the person responsible for her disappearance is asked to call the tip line at 1-800-423-TIPS. The reward is $10,000. Kesse would be 26 years old and has blonde hair, green eyes, is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds.","Inmate calls missing woman's father, says he heard other inmates talking .

"(CNN) -- Kansas leaders Wednesday ended a standoff that had delayed tax refunds and state paychecks by agreeing to borrow $225 million from various state accounts, a spokeswoman for the governor's office said. Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius approved $300 million in budget cuts Wednesday. Republican lawmakers approved moving money into the state's main account to pay the bills after budget cuts agreed to by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, spokeswoman Brittany Stiffler said. The state resumed processing income tax refunds on Wednesday -- they had been suspended last week because of low funds -- and state employees' paychecks will be paid on time Friday, Department of Administration spokesman Gavin Young said. Republicans earlier this week denied the Democratic governor's request to move the money, saying they could not approve the certificate of indebtedness, also known as internal borrowing, until they knew the state could repay the money by June 30, the end of the fiscal year. However, Republicans said they would be likely to approve the internal borrowing if Sebelius agreed to the Legislature's proposed budget cuts for the 2009 fiscal year. On Wednesday, she approved about $300 million in budget cuts. ""She blinked, and that's helpful,"" Senate Majority Leader Derek Schmidt, a Republican, said Wednesday. ""I'm just sorry we had to have high drama and worry a lot of Kansans about our ability to pay our obligations,"" Sebelius said Wednesday. Kansas was one of several states to meet this week to address budget concerns in a time when 43 states are starting the year short on funds, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""This is an equal-opportunity recession.

""For most, it has only gone downhill. They have tried to make up the difference with expanded gambling, with delays of construction projects, with hiring freezes, with fee and tax increases. But almost all of this has failed to regain lost ground, merely serving as a firebreak against worse troubles,"" she said. California faces a $42 billion deficit that prompted Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare a fiscal emergency in December. California lawmakers worked into early Wednesday but couldn't pass a budget. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued 10,000 layoff notices Tuesday, affecting a wide spectrum of state agencies and employees, in an effort to deal with the budget crisis, a spokesman said. Another 10,000 layoff notices might be sent Wednesday, the spokesman said. All the layoffs would take effect July 1, the start of the new fiscal year. The Republican governor has butted heads for months with the Democratic majority over easing the $11.2 billion revenue shortfall this fiscal year alone. Cuts would save California $750 million for the year. The $42 billion deficit is for the current and next fiscal years. Interactive: See projected state budget gaps » .

In Washington state, proposed budget cuts have led to protests in the capital, Olympia, KOMO-TV in Seattle reported. State officials are looking at some $300 million in cuts as part of a package the governor is expected to sign this week. Lawmakers also are aiming to cut nearly $6 billion over the next two years. But about 100 union members, state employees, school supporters and health care providers rallied on the lawn of the Capitol, telling lawmakers to stop the health care and education cuts and prevent tuition hikes. State employees said they want fair pay, better benefits and pensions and no layoffs. Hawaii faces a nearly $2 billion budget shortfall in the upcoming fiscal year. That figure has led legislators to seek alternative ways of balancing the budget, including possible reductions in health and retirement benefits for government workers, KHNL-TV in Honolulu reported Tuesday.

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose current book is ""When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams."" Peggy Sue Gerron, left, and Jerry Allison, right, at Buddy Holly's wedding to Maria Elena Holly. (CNN) -- After days on end of grim and dreary news, the first weekend of spring is with us, and with its arrival comes, to many people, the yearly promise of new romance and a chance for lasting love. But if figuring out the secrets of how to revive a battered economy is something that is complicated and elusive, that quandary is simple in comparison to matters of the heart. The legendary experts on romance, star-crossed and otherwise, are generally not available for comment. Romeo and Juliet have left the building. However, there is one person I know who has a better feel for the vagaries of love than most, and I sought her out the other day. ""Spring is the time when you allow yourself to hope that love will come around again,"" said Peggy Sue Gerron. You may not recognize her full name, but you sure do recognize the first part of it. Yep -- she's that Peggy Sue. The Peggy Sue of Buddy Holly's unforgettable 1957 hit, a song of longing and heartbreak that is instantly familiar today even to people who weren't born until decades after it came out. ""If you knew Peggy Sue, then you'd know why I feel blue ..."" Juliet, that other symbol of the glory of love, may have been a fictional creation of William Shakespeare's imagination, but Peggy Sue was, and is, real. She lives in West Texas, just as she did when Buddy Holly recorded the song. She was actually not even his girlfriend, although she sensed a certain yearning on his part. She was the girlfriend of Jerry Allison, the drummer for the Crickets, Holly's band. ""I think the reason people think about finding love in the spring is that the season represents new beginnings,"" she said. ""The flowers are blooming. The air smells good. You feel that you have a chance."" In the song, Peggy Sue, implicitly, was the one who did the dumping, not the one who got dumped. But time has made her understand: . ""I think, I really believe, that on a rare occasion, two people in life run across each other in a path like two comets. And when it happens, I think that feeling lasts forever."" Which is to say: With a love so rare and true. And that, she said, is what makes people keep looking for love regardless of how many times they may have tried and failed. She has a theory of what being in love does to a person: . ""Your eyes are a little bit shinier and your skin is a little bit clearer when you're in love. When you meet that person, you think: Whatever you're doing, I want to be right beside you when you're doing it. I want to be near you just because I like to see your smile."" Not that being Peggy Sue means she has all the answers. ""I don't,"" she said. She is 68 now; she has been married twice, divorced twice. When she introduces herself to new people, they often say, ""Oh -- like the Peggy Sue in the song!"" Sometimes she tells them she is in fact that Peggy Sue; sometimes she lets it go. It's an uphill battle to convince them she's not kidding. And as the woman who eternally will be a symbol of true love's ways, she thinks she understands why people never give up on hoping to find the right person. ""You have a tendency to put the walls up after you've been hurt,"" she said. ""You think it's not worth trying again. But then you do it anyway. It's like it's not even up to you. It's stronger than your intellect."" For those who, as spring arrives, have just lost a great love, her advice for dealing with the sadness is to remember that some people never find love in their whole lives. ""Even if you're the one to get left, you've been lucky to have the feeling. And the feeling, unlike the person, will never leave you."" Somewhere this spring -- many somewheres, undoubtedly -- the words, sung for the first time more than 50 years ago, will come blasting once again out of a car dashboard's speakers: . ""Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sue."" And people in 2009, hearing it, will remember anew just how much happiness the right person can bring. ""When I first heard the song,"" Peggy Sue said, ""I just thought the drums and the lyrics and the melody were so great, it made me want to get up and dance. As I grew older, it began to seem like more of a love song to me. It began to seem more like a song about not giving up."" Living in Lubbock, Texas, a ham radio enthusiast in an age of Twitter and text messages, she said she is currently not dating anyone. And with the arrival of spring, and its universal promise of life's best possibilities, she acknowledges that there is hope in her own heart, too. ""Always,"" said Peggy Sue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Peggy Sue, of famous Buddy Holly song, lives in west Texas .

"(CNN) -- Two leading Jewish watchdog groups are denouncing a prominent cartoonist's illustration about Israel's offensive in Gaza, saying it uses anti-Semitic imagery. The cartoon was published Wednesday in newspapers and on the Internet. The Anti-Defamation League, which has been fighting anti-Semitism since it was founded in 1913, called the syndicated cartoon by Pulitzer Prize-winning Pat Oliphant ""hideously anti-Semitic."" The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which, among other things, fights anti-Semitism and educates people about the Holocaust, said ""the cartoon mimics the venomous anti-Semitic propaganda of the Nazi and Soviet eras."" Published Wednesday in newspapers and on the Internet, the cartoon shows the small figure of a woman, labeled Gaza, carrying a child. She is being pursued by a headless, jackbooted figure wielding a sword, marching in an apparent goose-step and pushing a fanged Jewish star on a wheel. The Anti-Defamation League said the cartoon used ""Nazi-like imagery"" and a ""hateful evocation of the Star of David."" Abraham H. Foxman, the ADL's national director, said the cartoon's ""outlandish and offensive use of the Star of David in combination with Nazi-like imagery is hideously anti-Semitic."" ""It employs Nazi imagery by portraying Israel as a jack-booted, goose-stepping headless apparition,"" Foxman said. ""The implication is of an Israeli policy without a head or a heart. Israel's defensive military operation to protect the lives of its men, women and children who are being continuously bombarded by Hamas rocket attacks has been turned on its head to show the victims as heartless, headless aggressors."" The Wiesenthal Center, which also issued its statement Wednesday, said it urged The New York Times Web site and other Web sites to remove the cartoon. ""There is nothing about Oliphant's cartoon not meant to denigrate and demonize the Jewish state, from the headless goose-stepping soldier to the horrific depiction of the Star of David about to devour a cowering innocent Gazan woman holding a baby,"" Rabbi Marvin Hier, the group's dean, and Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the group's associate dean, said in a joint statement. ""The imagery in this cartoon mimics the venomous anti-Semitic propaganda of the Nazi and Soviet eras. It is cartoons like this that inspired millions of people to hate in the 1930's and help set the stage for the Nazi genocide,"" the statement said. A spokeswoman for Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes Oliphant's work, issued a statement defending him, saying he, ""like all editorial cartoonists, uses his art to comment on important issues of the day widely reported in the worldwide media -- in this case, the conflict over Gaza. That his cartoons sometimes spark intense debate is a testament to his talent."" Universal said no media outlet had informed the syndicate that it removed the cartoon, but ""Oliphant's clients are not contractually bound to inform us."" A New York Times spokeswoman said, ""We did not run the cartoon in the newspaper, nor do we plan to do so."" She said NYTimes.com has, by contract with uclick.com, an ""Oliphant"" button on the cartoons page. ""Yesterday, those who clicked on it saw the cartoon you mentioned, which is now relegated to the Oliphant archive,"" she said. Imagery and rhetoric comparing Israel to Nazis have been deployed by Israel's persistent critics, who decry the Jewish state's treatment of Palestinians as oppressive and brutal. Israel and its supporters defend the state as humane and say it has properly defended itself against attacks. There has been sharp criticism of Israel's offensive against Hamas militants in Gaza who launched rockets into southern Israeli towns. Human Rights Watch said Wednesday the Israeli military's firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the offensive ""was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes,"" a claim denied by Israel. Israel has said that Hamas militants situated themselves among civilians during the offensive. Oliphant, who won the Pulitzer in 1967, has been a dominant figure in the editorial cartoon world. His work has been distributed since 1980 by Universal Press Syndicate, which calls the Australian native one of the ""sharpest, most daring practitioners"" among editorial cartoonists. He has received many honors, and his cartoons have been exhibited across the world. ""In 1998, the Library of Congress commemorated the acquisition of 60 of his works with a special exhibition at the Library's Great Hall,"" according to an Oliphant biography on the Universal Web site. This isn't the first time Oliphant's cartoons have drawn criticism. The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in 2005 ""wrote to the San Francisco Chronicle and Universal Press Syndicate to communicate concern over racist depictions of Arabs,"" according to the group's Web site, and the Asian American Journalists Association criticized offensive stereotypes in cartoons in 1999, 2001 and 2007. Debates over offensive editorial cartoons are not uncommon. Keith Woods, dean of faculty at the Poynter Institute, a journalism school in St. Petersburg, Florida, was asked to comment on the reaction to the cartoon, whether the cartoon was improper, and at what point in the editorial process an editor can say a product has gone too far. He said he understands the positions the Jewish groups and Israeli policy critics bring to the table. He said he believes Oliphant is saying that ""Israel is behaving toward the Palestinians the way the Nazis behaved toward the Jews"" and that he is stating an opinion shared by many in the Middle East and the world. ""I believe that like the caricatures they are, editorial cartoons by their nature exaggerate their messages, so I don't think Oliphant is suggesting a one-to-one comparison. So I get the message, instead, that Israel is acting brutally toward the Palestinians."" He also believes the ADL and the Wiesenthal Center ""are saying that the cartoon is at least doing unintentional harm (if not more calculated harm)."" ""I see their point. There are symbols -- and the Nazi extermination of the Jews is surely one of them -- that can only truly be analogized to their equals. Unadulterated evil compared with unadulterated evil. Israel's ongoing battles with its Arab neighbors may be many things, but it is not The Final Solution."" As for the question of how news organizations should handle and discuss such a cartoon, Woods said that ""Oliphant clearly has the right to provoke or offend. The question for him is: Do you truly wish to conflate a complex, historic conflict with one of the most evil acts in history? And for the newspapers that carry the cartoon -- and their behavior here is equally open to critique -- do you wish to perpetuate such a comparison?""","NEW: Cartoon's distributor defends cartoonist, cites his talent to stir debate .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The world's richest countries committed to ""any further action that may prove necessary"" to restore confidence in the global financial system, their finance ministers said as they wrapped up a two-day meeting in Rome. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is calling on governments to help restart the flow of credit. The Group of Seven finance ministers also urged countries not to close their markets to goods and services from abroad. ""An open system of global trade and investment is indispensable for global prosperity,"" they said in a statement at the end of their meeting Saturday. ""Protectionist measures ... would only exacerbate the downturn"" in the worldwide economy. The ministers said the global banking crisis had revealed ""fundamental weaknesses in the international financial system"" and called for urgent reform.  Watch workers put pressure on the ministers » . New U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, making his international debut at the meetings, called on governments to focus on stabilizing and strengthening financial systems and help restart the flow of credit. ""Although the precise mix of measures must be tailored to each country's situation -- our financial systems are different, [the] structures of our systems are very different -- there is a common recognition of more capital and government financing to help restart credit markets,"" he said. Italy hosted the meeting in its role as G-7 president for 2009. G-7 members includes the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, Britain and Canada. The agenda drawn up by Rome calls for adopting global measures and economic policy reforms capable of stabilizing the world economy and ensuring transparency to allow markets to function correctly.

""As we act together to build a strong foundation for economic growth and recovery, we need to begin the process of comprehensive reform of our financial system, so that we never again face a crisis of this severity,"" Geithner said. Another attendee, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said he supports such stimulus packages for advanced countries. ""The question is no more to convince the governments to move today, but for them to implement the policies they need to manage,"" Strauss-Kahn said.

"(CNN) -- President Obama's pledge to conquer cancer ""in our time"" is a great goal, but one of America's top cancer experts isn't sure he'd use the word ""cure."" Despite chemotherapy, some breast cancers recur, like a ""smoldering fire that flares up,"" Dr. Otis Brawley said. ""The idea of [calling for] a cure does scare me a little bit because, I don't think that's realistic in some cancers,"" says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. ""But I like the general overall idea, and I'm thrilled about the focus on health."" Obama's first proposed budget includes $6 billion for cancer research by the National Institutes of Health. That's on top of the additional $10 billion provided by the stimulus package for 2009 and 2010. But some cancer specialists say that rather than finding a cure, a more realistic scenario is that certain cancers that are fatal today will move into the realm of chronic illnesses. By chronic disease, doctors mean ""the way we think of diabetes or heart disease as chronic diseases, where people could live in peaceful coexistence with cancer, as opposed to the cancer continuing to advance,"" said Brawley, who also is CNNhealth.com's conditions expert. Dr. Tony Reid, an oncologist and director of clinical trials at the Moores Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego, shares this view. He sees the long-term management of certain cancers as chronic illness as a ""primary intermediate step"" as researchers work towards cures. Prevention efforts, including discouraging smoking, obesity, and environmental hazards, are also important components of the cure, Dr. Andreas Ullrich, medical officer in cancer control at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. How long it will actually take to cure cancer is anyone's guess, but Obama's initiative is encouraging, he said. ""We need this hope,"" Ullrich said. ""We need to invest in our efforts in research, in basic research, and also in social science to understand why people behave in a risky way, and how to prevent people from exposing themselves to cancer risk,"" he said. Given that ""cancer"" encompasses more than 200 diseases, it makes sense that different varieties would require different approaches for saving the lives of their victims. From Brawley's perspective, a cure happens when the disease has gone away and it's not likely to come back, and the person is likely to grow old and die from something totally unrelated. Reid put it in terms of years of survival -- with pancreatic cancer, which normally takes lives within six months of diagnosis, you're probably cured if you're still alive five years after surgery, he said. But breast cancer can come back even after 10 years, he said. About 11 million people living in the United States had a history of some form of cancer as of 2005, according to the latest statistics from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database. There has been progress, however. For American men, the risk of death for cancer is 20 percent lower than it was 20 years ago, Brawley said. Rates of new cancer diagnoses and deaths for U.S. men and women simultaneously fell for the first time since reporting began in 1998, according to a report published in November in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.  See a map of lung cancer in the U.S. from this report » . Already there are cancers that respond well to drugs for several years. Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors tend to tolerate the drugs well, for example, Reid said. ""I have many patients who will come back and say, 'Except for the fact that you tell me I have cancer, I don't know it,' "" he said. But after a while, these patients'  cancer cells mutate and evolve to become resistant to the drugs, finding ways around almost any drug, Reid said. Some breast cancer patients take medications for 10 years to prevent recurrence, said Dr. Stephanie Hines, physician at the breast center at the Mayo Clinic's Breast Cancer Center in Jacksonville, Florida. But great strides have been made in such drugs, she said. ""There is real promise at eventually eradicating breast cancer,"" she said. ""I would say maybe not in the next five or 10 years. But it may happen -- I don't know if in our lifetime."" Still, only a few kinds of cancer are currently cured, and that's often dependent on early detection -- testicular and early stage breast cancer are two of the few examples, Reid said. About 80 percent of lymphomas are cured, Brawley said. Metastatic lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer, on the other hand, are more likely to one day become ""chronic diseases,"" which would be treated throughout a person's life rather than eliminated, Brawley said. ""Once it's metastasized or spread, you can't really do surgery unless you want to do almost cherry-picking throughout the body, which doesn't really work,"" he said. Currently, some breast cancers regress even with chemotherapy. Cancer specialists compare these breast cancers to ""a smoldering fire which flares up every once in a while"" and requires more water, Brawley said. Extending the amount of time that a person could live like that is a ""reasonable goal,"" he said. Cancer doctors emphasize that Obama's initiative is a tremendous asset to cancer research. ""I think that all the tools are there -- it's just, we have to do the hard work of testing them, evaluating them, and making them available to patients, Reid said.","President Obama's proposed budget includes $6 billion for cancer research .

"(CNN) -- Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa said Friday he will not pay interest on the nation's foreign debt and that he was prepared to accept any consequences. Correa made the comments to reporters in Guayaquil, Ecuador, about the interest payments, one of which was due Friday, his office said in a statement. He said he was studying how to challenge the debt, which he called ""immoral and a betrayal of the country,"" a reference to the way the terms of the debt were originally set. He said that though $7 billion has already been spent to pay an original debt accrued during the 1980s of $4 billion, the principal remains about the same. ""If we have to confront international lawsuits, we will confront them and, I repeat, I assume all responsibility,"" he said. ""I could not permit the continued payment of a debt that, in any light, is immoral and illegitimate.""

But he said such complaints were outweighed by the ""tens of thousands of happy families with their own worthy little houses ... and all the people who can testify to the success of the program.""

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- A volcano in southwest Colombia erupted again Friday morning, raining ash on nearby residents and agricultural fields. The Galeras volcano, erupting here in January 2008, is considered the most active volcano in Colombia. None of the 8,000 residents who live near the Galeras volcano was reported injured, officials said. It is the second time in less than a week that the volcano has erupted. The government's Geological and Mining Institute raised the alert level from yellow to red, and officials opened eight shelters for displaced residents. Authorities ordered the 8,000 people who live near the volcano to evacuate. The city of Pasto, which has about 35,000 residents and is more than 12 miles (about 20 kilometers) from the volcano's crater, received a heavy downpour of ashes Friday. The volcano, near Colombia's border with Ecuador, previously erupted Saturday. It has erupted several times since it became active again in 1989. The only fatalities were in 1993, when nine people -- all scientists or tourists in or near the volcano's crater -- were killed. The volcano's crater is 14,029 feet (4,276 meters) above sea level in the Andes Mountains. It is considered the most active volcano in Colombia.

""I figured I'd get to see my girls, my daughters, more often. And Nicole said yes right away."" Besides the economic savings, the benefits are many. No longer do they have to shuttle Victoria, 7, and Caitlyn, 6, between two households. As a team, they can parent and be on the same page. Finding a baby sitter is never a problem. They take turns making meals, which they all share. Thompson and Arce, who are 20 years apart -- ""I had to get the whole spectrum going there,"" Thompson-Arce joked -- have become the best of friends, and share a similar sense of humor. They have tackled home improvement projects, run around together on days they both have off and often hang out at the kitchen table building plastic models. ""We just clicked,"" Thompson said. ""When I tell people, 'I'm living with my ex-wife and her husband,' I get some really strange looks. ...It's different. It's unusual, but it works."" The transition has been smooth and great for the kids, Thompson-Arce said. And for their benefit, irrespective of finances, she thinks it's a living situation they'll stick with for at least five to 10 years. It has, however, taken a little time for the little ones to get the story straight. Seven-year-old Victoria went back to school after winter break -- and after the whole team had blended under one roof -- and started telling people this: "" 'My mommy has two husbands,'"" Thompson-Arce remembered.

""There are so many families that go through divorce and can never let it go,"" she said. ""I'm thankful, and hopefully our situation can help people rethink things because if they have kids, it's in their best interest to get along."" One might wonder whether the couple, who've been married for less than a year, get enough time alone together, given where they're living. Thompson-Arce points out that her ex works a shift that sends him to bed at 7 p.m., so the evenings -- after the kids are asleep -- are for her and her husband to share.

Thompson-Arce, however, said that she and her husband are forever trying to get Thompson on the dating scene and want him to meet someone special.

"(CNN) -- The body of a journalist who was hacked to death in southeastern Nepal was cremated Tuesday as businesses and public transportation in the town of Janakpur remained shut for a second day to protest the killing. Uma Singh, who was murdered in Nepal Sunday, had talked about the difficulties of practicing journalism. Authorities said they arrested four people in connection with the death of Uma Singh, but they did not release the suspects' names or possible motive, said Damakant Jayashi, associate editor of the online news Web site, myrepublica.com. ""Journalists and human rights groups have descended on the town, and shops are shuttered in what almost seems like a spontaneous protest,"" Jayashi said. ""Journalists are all wearing black bands on their arms. And the FM stations in the city, all day yesterday, they played mourning tunes instead of their regular programs."" The killing of Singh, 26, is the latest in a ""troubling trend"" of attacks on reporters, the United Nations' human rights office in the country said. It asked the government to investigate the case and prosecute death threats against other journalists. ""Doing so will send a strong message that there will be no impunity for attacks against the media, nor for any serious crimes,"" the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal said. Singh wrote for a daily newspaper and reported for a radio station in Janakpur, about 240 km (150 miles) southeast of the capital city, Kathmandu. When she got home from work Sunday night, a group of about 15 men barged into the room she rented at a house and hacked her with ""khukhuris"" -- curved knives traditional to Nepal -- in full view of other boarders, authorities said. ""I am very very shocked,"" said Dharmendra Jha, president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists, which is leading the protests. ""If the government is not ready to provide any kind of security to journalists, it will be very difficult to do journalism in a free mode."" The group said it will announce a new phase of protests Wednesday. Authorities do not have a motive for the killing. In some of her articles, Singh spoke out against the dowry system, where a bride's family is forced to give cash and property to the groom's family before the wedding. Also Sunday, a group of men ransacked the house of another journalist in the same region, leaving a cross on her door and telling her it was her turn next, media groups said. Police do not know if the two incidents are related. In recent months, the number of attacks on journalists in Nepal have shot up. The federation released a year-end report, recording 284 incidents -- including three deaths and a kidnapping. Some of the assailants have ties to the Communist Party of Nepal, the largest party in Nepal's coalition government, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch. The party is led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, or Prachanda -- a man who led a decade-long bloody insurgency before being sown in as prime minister. During the decade-long civil war, Maoist forces under him carried out numerous attacks on journalists they believed were opposed to their cause, Human Rights Watch said. And after he became prime minister, Prachanda issued a public warning to journalists while addressing a massive crowd in Kathmandu: ""Now we will no longer tolerate criticism as we have already been elected by the people."" Three years ago, Singh's father and elder brother disappeared. Her family has all along accused local Maoist leaders of being behind the disappearances, Jayashi said. Singh, herself, talked about the difficulties of practicing journalism in an interview with the United Nations last year. ""Various armed groups that are mushrooming have been a major challenge for us. We have been compelled to dance to their tunes. ...This makes us helpless,"" she said in the interview. ""What do we do? If we don't air the news of their choice, they threaten to kill us. Things have become very, very difficult for us.""","Nepalese journalist who reported on women's rights hacked to death Sunday .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's opposition leader called the cholera outbreak in his country a ""man-made crisis,"" as new figures released Thursday showed the death toll had soared to more than 2,700. Morgan Tsvangirai tours a cholera ward at Budiriro Polyclinic in Harare Thursday. Some 2,755 have died and 48,623 people are suspected to have been infected with cholera since last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. Opposition party leader Morgan Tsvangirai, speaking to reporters, pointed a finger at the Mugabe government. ""Cholera in Zimbabwe is a man-made crisis. The problem we have here is coupled with (the) fact of negligence on the part of government to provide the necessary facilities. It shows the collapse of the health delivery system,"" said Tsvangirai. The Movement for Democratic Change leader's comments came after he toured some of the worst affected areas in the country's capital, Harare. Zimbabwe's cholera epidemic, which started in August, has been aggravated by erratic water supplies, shortages of water purification chemicals, broken water and sewer pipes and uncollected garbage. Cholera is an intestinal disease cause by bacteria in contaminated water. The epidemic was followed a month later by a strike by doctors and nurses demanding a review of their salaries. They are demanding that archaic hospital equipment be replaced and that medicines be available in hospitals. The health emergency comes at a time when Zimbabwe is mired in the worst economic crisis it has faced since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1980. Last week, the United Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF) gave $5 million to Zimbabwe's ailing health sector to help end the industrial action by health personnel. As Tsvangirai was visiting the cholera affected areas, some residents could be seen getting water from the wells and rivers. Most suburbs in Harare have had no water for close to two weeks, forcing residents to depend on shallow pits and rivers for drinking water. The Zimbabwe National Water Authority was quoted by the state-owned media Saturday attributing the dryness to a water pump which had broken-down. The areas particularly affected include the townships of Glen Norah, Glen View and Budiriro. ""I am here with my kids for the last two days,"" said Ennie Musararei, a mother of three at Budiriro clinic. ""It (cholera) just started after we drank water from a well. We thought it was safe to drink since it was covered by a metal sheet."" President Robert Mugabe's government have now declared cholera a national emergency, so that international organizations such as UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders and Red Cross can gain access. But death toll has continued to increase daily. ""This week alone has witnessed a sudden increase of patients,"" said a nurse at Budiriro clinic. ""I think it is mainly because of the rains and dryness of the suburbs over the past week or so."" Earlier this month, Zimbabwe's health minister, David Parirenyatwa, said the death toll was likely to increase as the country is in its rainy season. The meteorological office in Zimbabwe has predicted floods in some parts of the country.","World Health Organization: 2,755 cholera deaths in Zimbabwe since last year .

"(CNN) -- Somali pirates have turned high-seas kidnappings into a lucrative business, one that netted between $50 million and $150 million last year, a former Navy SEAL told CNN. Attackers hijacked the Maersk Alabama, shown here, formerly known as the Alva Maersk. Kaj Larsen spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper Wednesday night about the changing tactics of pirates in Somalia. Below is a transcript of that interview, portions of which have been edited. Cooper: You have spent a fair amount of time there. You have actually met with the pirates, right? Larsen: I did. I met with some of the pirates that were operating out of Port of Mogadishu in 2006. And that was right before this current uptick in piracy that we're seeing so much of right now. Cooper: And why the uptick? Just because now they realize it's so profitable? Larsen: Sure, absolutely. There's an extraordinary incentive to conduct acts of piracy. Last year, they estimate the pirates took in somewhere between $50 million and $150 million in ransom money. It's extraordinary. It's very lucrative. And, obviously, the cheap flow of weapons available in Somalia all contribute to this problem of maritime piracy.  See how pirate attacks are skyrocketing » . Cooper: And this is a different situation, because now the USS Bainbridge is on scene. This is the first time an American has been held hostage. But, normally, a whole crew gets taken hostage, and it's basically a negotiation between the company that owns the vessel or the cargo and the pirates. Larsen: Right Obviously, this is a very unique situation and it's developing right now as we speak. So, this is setting new standards and new precedents. My concern during this situation is that the pirates, seeing their first batch of resistance, in the future might be using more aggressive tactics now that they see that some ships are willing to fight back. Cooper: You were a Navy SEAL. What is the procedure in something like this? Larsen: Well, obviously, each situation is very unique, and so they have to balance the use of force with the potential threat of injury to the hostage. Again, this is a unique situation. This is the first time Americans have been taken hostage, so we could see a new precedent being set.  Watch how pirates operate off Somalia » . In the past, the U.S. Navy and the other coalition forces and the combined task force in the region has been reluctant to engage with the pirates militarily, for fear that one of the hostages will be hurt. We will see if that continues to be the case here. Cooper: And, basically, I mean, if [pirates are] operating 350 miles offshore, and they're running around, and then they're going around in these little skiffs, do they have a larger boat nearby somewhere in the area? ... They can't go 350 miles offshore in a little skiff, can they? Larsen: No, absolutely not, I mean, although you are seeing improved weather conditions in the Gulf of Aden, which is responsible for the increased in attacks over the past week, 350 miles is a long ways out at sea. So, again, the pirates are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, are actually [using] mother ships in many cases, from which they send out the small speedboats out to both track and then sometimes assault these tanker and these container ships in the gulf. Cooper: How do you think this thing is going to end? Do you have any idea? Larsen: I don't really have any idea. In the past, what we have seen is a classic kidnap-for-ransom hostage negotiation system, where the insurance companies end up paying sometimes millions of dollars for these pirates. In this case, I think the very close presence of a U.S. Navy vessel might ...  provide some discomfort to the pirates in the area.","Ex-Navy SEAL says kidnapping of American is change for Somali pirates .

"(CNN) -- A crew member on a U.S.-flagged cargo ship captured by pirates off the coast of Somalia is suing his employers, claiming they sent him into pirate-infested waters without adequate protection, his attorney said Monday. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse has been charged with piracy in federal court in New York. Richard Hicks of Royal Palm Beach, Florida, a crew member on the Maersk Alabama, filed suit Monday against Waterman Steamship Corp. and Maersk Line Limited, according to the attorney, Terry Bryant. A spokeswoman for Mobile, Alabama-based Waterman Steamship Corp. said she did not know about the suit and did not immediately comment. A spokeswoman for Maersk Line Limited did not immediately return a call from CNN seeking comment. The Maersk Alabama was hijacked by pirates April 8. Hicks, working as chief steward and preparing food for other crew members, heard over the loudspeaker that pirates were on board, and he and other crew members gathered in the ship's engine room for nearly 12 hours, according to a news release from Bryant. ""The engine room was dark and hot, maybe 130 degrees,"" Hicks said in the news release. ""We were all cramping up with heat stroke symptoms when we were able to take a pirate hostage and tried to negotiate the return of our captain."" The pirates promised to exchange Capt. Richard Phillips for the pirate hostage, but reneged on that agreement, the news release. Phillips offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the freedom of his crew. He was held on a lifeboat until U.S. Navy snipers on a nearby ship fatally shot three pirates, rescued Phillips and arrested a fourth pirate. The ship's owners -- the two companies -- knowingly exposed their employees to danger and took no steps to provide appropriate security and safety for the crew, Bryant alleges. ""Waterman Steamship Corp. and Maersk Line Limited chose to rely on the United States military and taxpayers to provide after-the-fact rescue operations,"" Bryant said in the news release. ""This choice caused substantially more cost and risk to human life than what would have been incurred by defendants had they provided appropriate levels of security in the first place."" Hicks is seeking at least $75,000, and ""reserves the right to amend this pleading for a certain amount in the future, as it is too early to determine the maximum amount of plaintiff's damages,"" according to the suit. Hicks is still suffering from injuries as a result of the incident and is afraid to return to work, the news release said.","Suit alleges crew sent into pirate-infested waters without protection .

"Editor's note: Carlos del Rio, MD, is the Hubert Professor and chair in the global health department at the Rollins School of Public Health and professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Emory University's School of Medicine. Del Rio is a native of Mexico and was executive director of the National AIDS Council of Mexico from 1992 through 1996. Dr. Carlos del Rio says U.S. and Mexican authorities deserve credit for their responses to the swine flu outbreak. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The swine flu outbreak that started less than a month ago has caused more than 150 deaths in Mexico and more than 60 confirmed cases across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, with suspected cases in France, Spain, Israel and New Zealand. It is clear that a new virus has emerged that is different enough that the population's previous exposure to influenza viruses and vaccines do not provide immunity. So far, public health authorities are meeting this challenge with strength and preparedness. The Mexican and American federal governments deserve credit for their thorough responses. The major control strategy that has been implemented in Mexico is social-distancing, a range of nonquarantine measures that attempt to reduce contact between persons, such as closing schools, canceling cultural and sports events, and closing museums and parks. In addition, countries are strengthening surveillance, releasing antiviral stockpiles and issuing travel advisories. In the United States, federal officials are working closely with and providing guidance to state and local public health authorities, who have to make decisions about whether to close schools or prevent other large-scale gatherings. The cross-border nature of this outbreak is a strong argument for why the United States should cooperate with and support competent institutions of government in other countries, even during a period of economic uncertainty. The first case of swine flu in the United States during the current outbreak was identified in San Diego County by part of a surveillance program connected with the Naval Health Research Center there, which only began monitoring influenza in 2005. In this program, physicians collect nasal swabs from patients at community clinics on both sides of the border. Only when Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists sent a suspect sample to the mass spectrometer did they discover the new variety of swine flu, according to an article describing the techniques in Science magazine. Two critical questions remain. Why have mortality rates been higher in Mexico? And how should preparations for the regular flu season later this year be modified? Reports from Mexico that the virus has primarily struck otherwise healthy young adults are alarming because seasonal influenza typically affects the very young and very old. Still, preliminary genetic analysis shows that the virus strains isolated from patients in California are identical to those seen in severely ill Mexican patients. It is possible that some of the patients in Mexico, many of whom are dying of pneumonia, are succumbing to secondary infections. Medical historians believe that a large proportion of those who died of the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 were not killed by the flu virus, but by secondary bacterial pneumonia, which was difficult to treat before the introduction of antibiotics. Thus, enhancing vaccination against pneumonia may prove to be a critical strategy in decreasing influenza mortality during future outbreaks. Additional investigation of those who have died is however, urgently needed to determine the best response strategy. An issue that keeps coming up is the idea of closing the U.S.-Mexico border. Already at various border crossing points, customs authorities are having people who appear sick taken to a secondary inspection area for further evaluation. More systematic monitoring at border crossing and airports such as mouth swabs has been proposed. Is that a good strategy? I would argue that it is not. The U.S.-Mexico border is one of the busiest in the world with millions of people and goods crossing each day. Many items that we routinely use in the United States are produced in Mexico and closing the border would have a crippling effect to the United States. For example, in the event of a serious flu outbreak in this country there would be a need for mechanical ventilator deployments to hospitals. The national stockpile has sufficient ventilators, but the necessary circuits that are needed to operate them are not produced in the United States but in Mexico, so having them come across to this country is critical for taking care of critically ill patients in the United States. The second issue is how to prepare for the coming flu season. During the flu pandemic of 1918, cases began in the spring and then faded away during the summer, only to come back with a vengeance in the fall and winter. Thus, we need to be prepared for an even worse outbreak of swine flu this winter and should not declare victory too soon. Considerable evidence has accumulated that the practice of producing seasonal vaccines in chicken eggs is cumbersome and sometimes ineffective. There is an urgent need for the development of more modern techniques of vaccine production. The National Institutes of Health has been putting its research resources into the fight. In 2007, the NIH created six Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance, located at Emory University, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, UCLA, University of Minnesota and University of Rochester. Sunday's emergency declaration signaled for these centers to devote their resources to monitoring and responding to the swine flu outbreak. Researchers at these centers have developed alternatives to chicken eggs and new delivery methods. Now is the time to put these alternatives to the test, so that countries around the world are fully prepared for the coming flu season and future outbreaks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carlos del Rio.","Dr. Carlos del Rio: U.S. and Mexico have responded well to swine flu outbreak .
He says cross-border cooperation is crucial to successful battle against flu .
Key question is why Mexico's illnesses have been more deadly, he says .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Predicting the path of a swine flu outbreak is next to impossible, public health officials say. But Dr. Ira Longini has spent more than three decades trying to do just that. Dr. Ira Longini studies simulations of hypothetical influenzas and how they would spread. And Longini says the apparent new strain of swine flu appears to be here to stay. ""We are probably going to have to live with this virus for some time,"" he told CNN. Longini specializes in the mathematical and statistical theory of epidemics. He works at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute at the Hutchinson Research Center in Seattle, Washington. The researcher studies simulations of hypothetical influenzas and how they would spread across the United States. For the moment, he said, there is not enough information about the swine flu that has sickened hundreds in Mexico and about 50 people in the United States to accurately forecast how the disease will travel. But Longini's simulations of a fictional killer flu that were ordered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show the importance of steps health officials can take to prevent further spread of the virus. These measures include ""social distancing,"" or encouraging those sickened with the flu to stay home or seek medical treatment; closing places where groups of people gather; and making anti-flu medications available to large portions of the population. In the simulations, Longini said, these forms of containment reduce the sickness by nearly two-thirds. ""The name of the game is to slow transmission until a well-matched vaccine can be made and distributed. I am fairly optimistic we can do that,"" he said.  Watch how computer models simulate an outbreak's spread » . So far, Longini said, it appears that everyone sickened by swine flu in the United States contracted the disease while traveling in Mexico, the apparent epicenter of the outbreak. But he cautioned: ""That could change very fast. Obviously people in these communities could also get on airplanes and go other places or get on buses or cars or trucks and move around. The picture may change very rapidly. Basically, influenza is going to go where people go."" Health officials agree that the worst may still be yet to come. ""It is too soon for us to say what the spectrum is,"" Dr. Richard Besser, the acting director of the CDC, said Monday on Larry King Live. ""We are going to see cases in this country that are more severe, individuals who are hospitalized, and I would not be surprised if we see deaths in this country."" Longini said health officials are doing everything they can to mitigate how widely the swine flu spreads in the United States. Even if authorities examined everyone entering the country, Longini said, it would not solve the problem. ""Through simulations and mathematical work we've shown that travel restrictions -- although potentially useful in slowing spread [of swine flu] -- they are not going to stop it,"" Longini said. ""We can screen airline passengers, but there all those asymptomatic or incubating people we would miss. So you really have to deal with these outbreaks locally, everywhere they are occurring.""  Watch how countries are scanning travelers » . Longini said he hopes that as more data come in about the outbreak, it will help to answer questions researchers have about why the swine flu appears more deadly in the Mexico cases than the ones in the United States. Researchers also hope to find out why such a large percentage of fatalities in Mexico are young people whose healthy immune systems usually protect them from the flu. But there is good news, Longini said, at least temporarily, for populations in certain areas. In North America and Europe, summer will soon begin, ending the traditional flu season. Even outbreaks such as swine flu tend to follow standard flu season patterns, he said. Other parts of the world may not be so lucky. ""Timing is terrible for people in the Southern Hemisphere -- places like New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, parts of South America, ""Longini said. ""They are just coming into their flu season.""","Researcher studies how a potential flu outbreak could spread .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military continued its assault Thursday on militants in Taliban-held areas, its chief spokesman told reporters. Pakistani army trucks move military equipment into the troubled Buner district Thursday. So far, 14 militants have been killed in the past 24 hours, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said. The operation is still ongoing in the districts of Dir and Buner, which was recently seized by the Taliban in violation of an agreement with Pakistan's government. Pakistani forces have completely secured Daggar, the main town in Buner and the scene of heavy fighting on Wednesday, Abbas said. The Daggar operation resulted in the deaths of 50 militants, but freed 18 Frontier Corps personnel who had been abducted by militants, he said. Fifty-two of their colleagues are still believed to be held by their suspected Taliban kidnappers. This week's military operation has resulted in more than 180 militant casualties since Sunday, while the military has suffered one death and one injury, according to Abbas. He said he hopes the operation will be completed by the end of the week. Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters, communication equipment and night vision technology, Abbas said Thursday. Most of this week's casualties happened on Tuesday, when Pakistani fighter jets launched airstrikes, killing at least 70 militants in the Dir district, according to the Pakistani military. The operation is part of the Pakistani army's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, which have rankled relations between the two countries. The military campaign has apparently not stopped Washington from carrying out unmanned drone attacks on Pakistan's soil. A suspected unmanned aerial vehicle killed six people Wednesday night in the village of Kaniguran in the tribal district of South Waziristan near the border with Afghanistan, Pakistani intelligence sources said. Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are American airstrikes on its territory. The U.S. military in Afghanistan has not commented on the strikes, which typically target Taliban fighters in the border region. But the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled drones. U.S. President Barack Obama is ""gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan,"" he told reporters Wednesday night. Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office, Obama said the United States has ""huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable"" and doesn't end up a ""nuclear-armed militant state."" But he stressed he was more concerned about the ability of Pakistan's civilian government to ""deliver basic services,"" and not ""that they're immediately going to be overrun"" by the Taliban. Pakistan's recent military crackdown has led to an exodus of civilians from the region. At least 33,000 residents have left their homes in the midst of the recent fighting, according to Amnesty International. Civilians fleeing from Lower Dir in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province join more than 500,000 people already displaced by the fighting, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The Pakistani military completed its operation to eliminate and expel militants in Dir Tuesday, and is now focusing on the Buner district, Abbas said. About 300 militants entered Buner a few days ago, in violation of the Taliban's recent agreement to leave the district, he said. Buner is about 60 miles from Islamabad, but Abbas said the militants pose no threat of entering the capital. The fighter jets pounded targets in Buner and the Swat Valley in an effort to block the militants' entry and exit points, according to Abbas. CNN's Samson Desta, Ivan Watson, and Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Pakistani military intensifies drive against Taliban in restive tribal regions .

"(InStyle) -- I can't find it anywhere in the Constitution, so maybe there is a first lady dress code buried in an obscure addendum to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, since every mistress of the White House for the last four decades has chosen a wardrobe that follows a particular one with near pathological devotion. President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrive in  Prague, Czech Republic, in early April. No sooner does her inaugural ballgown get spirited away to the Smithsonian, then out it comes: The First Lady Suit -- that tailored, multibuttoned blazer over a skirt straighter than an Ionic column in a primary, patriotic or tastefully unobjectionable color.

Because during these first 100 days, our newest first lady has banished every version of this silhouette as if they were all designed by the House of Dick Cheney. Instead, Mrs. Obama has defined with remarkable acuity what flatters a tall, broad-shouldered and curvaceous working woman who knows exactly who she is and where she is going. With an enviable eye for color and layering, she has fashioned a riveting parade of on- and off-the-shoulder dresses, cardigans, cinched trenches, leggings, wide-legged trousers and full skirts, working them in intense florals or unexpected hues such as chartreuse and emerald.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A man who Los Angeles police believe raped and murdered dozens of women decades ago was arrested by cold case investigators this month after a computer matched his DNA to evidence from two killings in the 1970s. John Floyd Thomas Jr. may have begun his killings as far back as 1955. John Floyd Thomas Jr., 72, may have begun his killings as far back as 1955 and he could be one of the worst serial killers in United States history, according to Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton. ""We have yet to reach the depths of what he has done,"" Bratton said Thursday. Until his April 2 arrest, Thomas was a Los Angeles insurance adjuster. Police now call him the ""Southland Strangler"" -- named for the geographical section of Los Angeles County where they suspect he killed at least 30 women and raped many more. Thomas, who sits in a Los Angeles jail, has been charged with two killings -- in 1972 and 1976 -- but prosecutors will likely add more cases when he faces arraignment on May 20, Bratton said. While Thomas was arrested ""a number of times between 1955 and 1978"" for sex crimes and burglaries, detectives did not have the technology to identify him as a suspect when the region was terrorized by a series of killings then blamed on the ""Westside Rapist,"" Bratton said.  Watch why  the suspect may be L.A.'s most prolific serial killer » . Officials, using new computer databases and software, are now ""looking to see what the patterns were,"" said Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Charlie Beck. ""A lot of work has yet to be done,"" Beck said. Bob Kistner had just begun his law enforcement career in 1976 when his great aunt, 80-year-old Maybelle Hudson, was beaten, raped and strangled in the garage of her Inglewood, California, home. He had just retired as a sergeant with the Long Beach, California, Police Department when he got the call recently that investigators linked Thomas to her murder. ""I waited my entire career for that phone call,"" Kistner said. It was a routine call to Thomas from an LAPD officer last fall that led to the break in the case. Thomas, a registered sex offender, is required by California law to provide a DNA sample for inclusion in the state's database. Because of a backlog of cases, Thomas was not asked until October to report to a patrol station to have the inside of his cheek swabbed. ""He was very cooperative,"" the patrolman who took the sample said. The California Department of Justice called LAPD cold case detectives on March 27 to tell them the DNA came up as a match to rape kit evidence collected from Ethel Sokoloff, who was 68 in 1972 when she was found beaten and strangled in her Los Angeles home. Those detectives had sent the biological evidence from the Sokoloff case to a state lab in 2002 as part of their review of about 6,000 unsolved murders in Los Angeles that happened between 1960 and 1996. DNA analysis in 2004 concluded that Sokoloff's killer also beat, raped and killed Elizabeth McKeown, 67, in 1976, Beck said. The murders of three other older women -- including Maybelle Hudson -- were also linked by DNA to a common killer, he said. ""Because of Thomas's criminal background, the close proximity of his homes to murder locations, similar victim descriptions [white elderly females] and other evidence that suggests the type of modus operandi used by the suspect, detectives strongly believe Thomas is very likely the suspect in 'The Westside Rapist' cases,"" a police statement said. Thomas is single, although he has been married five times, police said. While he served about 12 years in prison between 1955 and the late 1970s for his previous convictions, he has no record since his last arrest in 1978, police said. Deputy Chief Beck said the growing use of DNA databases and computers to match them to crime evidence will likely lead to more cold case killers being identified.","Police say John Thomas Jr. may have begun killing as far back as 1955 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- On May 4, 2007, Kara Kopetsky, a 17-year-old high school junior in Belton, Missouri, was not having a good day. Kara Kopetsky, 17, left school early in Belton, Missouri, on May 4, 2007, and hasn't been seen since. She forgot one of her textbooks and called home and asked her mom to drop it off at the school office. She also asked her mother to wash her uniform so she could work the 4 p.m. shift at Popeye's Chicken. Later that morning, Kara had an argument with one of her teachers in class, according to police and her family. Frustrated, she left campus about 10:30 a.m., ditching school for the rest of the day. A school surveillance video shows her walking out. But no one can say which way she went, or whether she got into a car. It was the last time anyone saw or heard from her. Police say there has been no activity on Kara's cell phone since shortly after she walked out of school. They followed some pings from the phone, conducted some searches, but found nothing significant. Beyond that, they aren't commenting.  Watch an update on the case » . Kara's stepfather says the cell phone's long silence makes him suspicious. ""This doesn't make any sense,"" said Jim Beckford. ""Kara was on her cell phone sending texts constantly. Her cell phone bill was typically 80-100 pages long."" When Kara didn't come home from school as usual, her family -- mother Rhonda, stepfather Jim and stepbrother Thomas -- grew worried. They filed a missing persons report later that afternoon. Police told them they believed Kara was a runaway, and that she'd come back on her own in a few days. Two years later, her family hasn't heard a word from Kara. She left behind most of her belongings -- money, clothes, iPod and a new carton of cigarettes. Her bank debit card was left in her school locker and her bank account, with $150 from her recent paycheck, remains untouched. According to police in Belton, the case is being actively investigated. But with no certain evidence of foul play, police continue to characterize Kara's disappearance as an endangered and missing adult case. The state of Missouri considers Kara Kopetsky to be an adult because she was 17 when she disappeared. Belton Police Capt. Don Spears said police are looking at several persons of interest, but haven't narrowed their investigation to focus on a single suspect. Her family says she has no history of running away. They say they fear that she was abducted when she left school that day. ""She is a very beautiful girl and so we often warned her to be careful, but like any teen, she had an attitude that she was invincible,"" her stepfather said. About a month after she disappeared, Kara's case was eclipsed by another sensational case -- the abduction and slaying of Kelsey Smith. Smith was taken from a store parking lot in Overland Park, Kansas, and her body was found in the Missouri woods, six miles from Kara's home in Belton. A suspect was charged, pleaded guilty, and is serving a life sentence. Police in Belton and Overland Park compared notes but could find no connection. According to family and police and Kara's MySpace profile, she had an on-again, off-again boyfriend. He lived in her neighborhood, was 18, and attended the same high school but dropped out earlier the spring Kara disappeared. Kara was trying to end the relationship, friends told police. It is unclear whether the two saw each other the day Kara vanished. A $30,000 reward is offered for tips leading to the whereabouts of Kara Kopetsky or the arrest of anyone responsible for her disappearance. Police and family urge people to call the Belton Police Department's tip-line at 816-474-TIPS. Kara is described as 5 feet 5 inches tall and 125 pounds with brown hair and hazel eyes.","Missouri teen left school early after an argument with a teacher .

"(CNN) -- The Sri Lankan army overran two Tamil Tiger rebel positions in the country's north on Tuesday, the military reported on its Web site. Recently captured rebel weapons stacked up in the former Tamil stronghold of Kilinochchi. The rebels ""suffered double blows, losing two heavily fortified defense positions as ... troops made predawn incursions at identified terror strong points located south of Valayanmadam today,"" the Ministry of Defense said. The claims of military victories came a day after Sri Lanka ordered an end to combat operations against the rebels by curtailing ""the use of heavy-caliber guns, combat aircraft and aerial weapons which could cause civilian causalities,"" a statement from the Presidential Secretariat said. A rebel Web site, Tamilnet.com, reported an ""intense barrage of heavy weapons"" through Monday evening. The rebel site accused the military of staging a ground offensive, ""firing artillery shells fitted with cluster munitions, multi-barrel rocket launcher (MBRL) fire and heavy mortar fire from many directions on the northern side of Mu'l'li-vaaykkaal."" The Tiger leadership has asked the international community to ""pressure the Sri Lankan government to reciprocate"" on a cease-fire offer proposed last week. The United States, the United Nations, the European Union and India have called for a cease-fire. Last week, India's foreign secretary and national security adviser met with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to express their concerns about the situation in the north, including casualties among civilians. India has a large Tamil population that sympathizes with the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka. The foreign ministers of two nations are due in Sri Lanka on Wednesday -- David Miliband of the United Kingdom and Bernard Kouchner of France. Carl Bildt of Sweden was originally scheduled to make the trip with his counterparts, but was not granted a visa, so he was forced to cancel, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. In what amounts to a diplomatic protest, Sweden will recall its ambassador to Sri Lanka for consultations. A government-imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed a week ago. Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country's northeastern coast. Government troops say they have rescued some 40,000 civilians trapped in the area, but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of ""fresh displacement"" now exceeds 100,000 people. The Sri Lankan military says up to 20,000 civilians continue to be held hostage by Tamil ""terrorists,"" adding that its forces will continue humanitarian operations to rescue them. Fifty metric tons of relief supplies -- which landed in Colombo on Monday -- will be sent by UNICEF to the north to help displaced residents. UNICEF, which called the situation in the north a ""catastrophe for children,"" said the displaced lack food, water and basic medical supplies. The rebels estimate the number of civilians still in the territory at more than 160,000. The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union. -- CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this story.","Sri Lankan army Web site: Two heavily fortified defense positions overrun .

"(CNN) -- A court in Saudi Arabia has granted an 8-year-old girl a divorce from her 47-year-old husband, after twice denying the divorce request previously, local media reported Thursday. The marriage sparked condemnations around the world from human rights groups and U.S. and other government officials when it first came to light in December. Local media, which is highly regulated by the Saudi government, reported that the court in the city of Onaiza approved the divorce decree Thursday, and the divorce is final. A source at the court told the Saudi daily newspaper Al-Watan that the divorce ""came after a series of pleas made by a number of officials in the region to the husband."" CNN efforts to reach court officials, the husband and the girl's father have been unsuccessful. According to the attorney for the young girl's mother, the father of the girl had arranged the marriage between his daughter and a close friend of his to settle his debts with the man. When the mother went to court to try to get the marriage annulled, Saudi judge Habib al-Habib rejected the request on a legal technicality. The judge ruled that the mother -- who is separated from the girl's father -- was not the child's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, according to the mother's lawyer, Abdullah al-Jutaili. However, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili said. The lawyer said in the original marriage agreement, the father of the girl stipulated that the marriage would not be consummated until she was 18. The judge also ruled that the girl could file a petition for a divorce when she reached puberty, al-Jutaili said. The young girl lives with her mother, the attorney said, and was never told that she was married. When the initial petition to annul the marriage was rejected, the mother appealed the verdict to an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. The appeals court declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration. Under the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect but that a challenge to the marriage was ongoing. Earlier this month, the original judge refused for a second time to annul the marriage. Soon after that decision, Saudi Arabia's justice minister told Al-Watan that he planned to enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages. The law will place restrictions on the practice to preserve the rights of children and prevent abuses, Justice Minister Mohammed Al-Issa was quoted as saying. Additionally, al-Issa said there would be a study of a system that will include regulations for the marriage of minors and everything related to such unions, the newspaper reported. No details on the restrictions or regulations were mentioned. The minister did not say whether child marriage would be abolished. Responding to the justice minister's comments and the possibility of a new child marriage law, al-Jutaili told CNN at the time, ""this is what we requested from day one, and we know that Saudi officials are working so hard on resolving this issue."" Al-Jutaili believes that such a law would help not only his defendant but many other Saudi minors facing a similar problem. In Washington Monday, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns called the marriage a human rights abuse. ""Child marriage is, unfortunately, still common in much of Saudi Arabia and we have voiced our concern about this practice at the highest levels,"" he told a conference on U.S.-Saudi relations. ""We were encouraged by reports that the Justice Ministry had begun to review the legal age of marriage."" After the divorce was denied for a second time, the head of the United Nations Children's Fund issued a statement expressing concern about the case. UNICEF Executive Director Ann Veneman said, ""the right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision."" The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative Saudi kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. ""It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,"" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. ""A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her."" Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. ""We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,"" he said, according to the newspaper. ""We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women."" Sharia law is Islamic law, and Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism.","Child bride wins divorce hearing at third attempt, local media reports .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Prince Charles visited the Vatican on Monday for his first meeting with a pope since his 1996 divorce from Princess Diana. Pope Benedict XVI is flanked by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla during their meeting at the Vatican. The heir to the UK throne was accompanied by his second wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, who wore the mandatory modest black dress and veil which the Vatican requires for wives of dignitaries who meet the pope. The 20-minute meeting was ""cordial,"" the Vatican said in a statement afterwards. Prince Charles's accession to the throne was likely to be an unspoken subtext of the meeting, an expert on the prince told CNN. ""The biggest thing on Prince Charles's agenda is the preparation for his coronation,"" said Christopher Wilson, author of ""The Windsor Knot: Charles, Camilla and the Legacy of Diana."" Charles would like the pope to attend personally, unlikely as that may be, given the religious divide between London and Rome, Wilson said. ""He will expect a high-profile Roman Catholic presence in Westminster Abbey,"" where he will be crowned, Wilson argued. ""The combined heads of state come from everywhere. Every democratically elected head of state will be invited. It bigs up your coronation if you can get the highest Roman Catholic to come."" The meeting between prince and pope came days after the 500th anniversary of the crowning of Henry VIII, the English king who broke with the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England because he wanted to divorce. It was Prince Charles's first visit to the Vatican since he went to the funeral of Pope John Paul II four years ago, and his first meeting with a head of the Roman Catholic Church since 1985. There are multiple factors complicating his relationship with the Vatican, Wilson pointed out. Not only is he divorced, which the Roman Catholic Church disapproves of, but so is Camilla -- and her children are being raised as Catholics because their father is one. A centuries-old British law forbids Catholics or their spouses from holding the throne. The Prince of Wales ""is trying to break down the breach between the Vatican and the House of Windsor,"" Wilson said. ""It's a path-smoothing exercise."" Additionally, he said: ""Prince Charles likes very much to be photographed with heads of state. He's not the head of state himself. It adds luster to his royal presence."" Charles and the pope were expected to discuss issues such as interfaith dialogue and climate change -- subjects to which Prince Charles has devoted himself. The pair exchanged gifts. Benedict gave Charles a gold pontifical medal and an antique engraved copper plate of St. Peter's Basilica dating from the 16th century. Charles gave Benedict a set of 12 porcelain plates with floral design of the plants and flowers that grow at his country estate in Gloucestershire. Afterwards, Prince Charles met Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarciso Bertone and Vatican foreign affairs minister Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, while Camilla received a private tour of the Sistine Chapel. Charles and Camilla are on a tour of Italy and Germany at the request of Britain's Foreign Office, Clarence House said. The European Union director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Matthew Rycroft, cited ""the prince's personal passion and personal engagement over the years on the issue of climate change"" as a major reason for the trip, a Clarence House statement said.","UK's Prince Charles meets pope for first time since divorce from Princess Diana .

"VERO BEACH, Florida (CNN) -- The Rev. Michael Massaro says he has a few aches and pains, but a good night's sleep has done him some good as he recovers from being attacked Saturday with a knife in a confessional at his church. The Rev. Michael Massaro is recovering from two stab wounds that required 14 staples to close. It was one of the most harrowing weekends in the 28 years he's been a Roman Catholic priest, Massaro said. But it won't stop him from hearing confessions. ""We're at the mercy of the people we serve,"" Massaro told CNN. ""We can't live in fear. God has asked us to live in trust. If it's going to happen again, it's going to happen again, but that's not going to prevent me from doing God's work."" Massaro had just finished hearing confessions in his Florida church when he was stabbed twice in the back by a woman who later told police Massaro is the Antichrist. ""It was paralyzing, like a nightmare, and I just feel like I woke up from it. It was so quick and sudden,"" Massaro said in a telephone interview. Vero Beach police arrested Josephine Gatchell in connection with the attack. The 57-year-old suspect is being held in the Indian River County Jail. She is being held without bail. Gatchell is scheduled to be arraigned on June 12. She has not yet been appointed a lawyer, prosecutors and the public defender said. ""She believed [Massaro] was the Antichrist and it was her duty to go there and injure him,"" police spokesman John Morrison said. Massaro said he thought he had one last confession to hear at about 12:15 p.m. on Saturday. A woman was waiting for him, apparently wanting to be be the last one in. ""I was in the confessional, putting my coat on, and felt a piercing sensation in my back left side,"" the priest recalled. ""I looked up and she was standing there, and I felt it again in my back. Then I realized I was stabbed and my hand was covered with blood."" Massaro said his alleged attacker stared at him but never said a word. ""I ran and got to the car and hoped I could make it to the hospital before I passed out. I was worried about becoming unconscious. Thanks be to God that I didn't hurt anyone driving,"" he said. An emergency room doctor told police that the knife ""went through muscle, a few veins and chipped a rib,"" according to an arrest affidavit. The blade missed vital organs by two to three centimeters, the affidavit said. Massaro underwent surgery to repair the damage. Doctors used 14 staples to close the ""T""-shaped wounds. The priest feels compassion for the woman who attacked him, and he is turning the other cheek. ""We have to continue to pray to do the church's work. To love, and most of all to forgive,"" he said. ""To be sure she doesn't do this again, she needs proper medical care. No one in their right mind would do this."" It was the second run-in with Gatchell at Holy Cross Catholic Church, according to police and church workers. She was arrested in January, records show, accused of breaking off a piece of a religious statue inside the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament. She also allegedly resisted arrest and reached for the officer's weapon. She was confronted by Deborah True, the parish manager. ""I took it away from her and asked her why she did that,"" True told CNN. ""She said she did it because it was from her husband's funeral, forty years ago, and Father Massaro stole it, and he was the Antichrist,"" she said. Massaro said he recognized Gatchell as he ran from the attack. ""As I was running away from her, I realized who she was,"" he said. ""She didn't make any efforts to come after me. I was still in a state of shock."" At the hospital, Massaro was able to pick Gatchell out of a photo lineup, police said. She was not at home when police went to question her, according to the arrest affidavit. Later, police received an anonymous tip that she was staying elsewhere. When police arrived, Gatchell answered the door and allegedly stated, ""You know who I am, and I know why you're here."" Gatchell told detectives that ""she remembers going over to Holy Cross (church)....and stabbing Mr. Massaro,"" according to the affidavit. When asked what she stabbed him with, the suspect replied, ""It was a big knife,"" the affidavit said. Police say she told them that the knife was in three different places, but it was never located. Vero Beach Police say that Gatchell appears to be a troubled woman. ""When you go back a second time, that raises more concerns. Her violence escalated the second time,"" said police spokesman Morrison. And just for the record, ""I am not the Antichrist, that I know of,"" Massaro said with a laugh.","The Rev.

"Editor's note: How would you rate President Obama's first 100 days? You'll get a chance to make your opinion known at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday on the CNN National Report Card. Supporters say President Obama is tackling an aggressive agenda, while critics say he's leaving Republicans behind. (CNN)  -- More than two years ago, a junior senator with presidential aspirations stood on the steps of Illinois' Old State Capitol in Springfield and warned of politicians who fail to live up to expectations. ""Too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own,"" then-Sen. Barack Obama said as he announced his intentions to pursue the Democratic nomination. Now, after 100 days in office, observers are asking the same of him: Has President Obama lived up to the expectations that candidate Obama created? ""What Obama has successfully done is keep his persona intact, which is a man of deep family values and a core moral center. And I think that people are learning to trust Obama that when he talks, he's not just articulate, but he's shooting straight,"" said presidential historian Doug Brinkley. Obama won the White House campaigning on a message of hope and a promise of change. As he emerged a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, he pushed an ambitious agenda, vowing to overhaul health care, education and energy policy. But as the severity of the economic meltdown took hold and Obama moved into the White House, his inspirational rhetoric was injected with a sobering dose of reality. Obama encouraged patience and cautioned that, ""change doesn't happen overnight."" In his first 100 days, Obama laid the groundwork for many of his campaign promises and faced criticism that he's trying to do too much. ""Nobody will ever be able to accuse him of being an idle man during his first 100 days,"" Brinkley said. ""He's clearly showing himself to be a progressive in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, with the moral core of Jimmy Carter."" So far Obama is showing himself to be ""the same guy that we had on the campaign trail,"" Brinkley said. Given the items on his agenda, Obama is living up to expectations, CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said. ""The public is patient and is not expecting to see a quick turnaround in the economy,"" he said. ""I count 10 major items -- jobs, health care, education, energy, housing, banks, automakers, deficit reduction, taxes and the war in Afghanistan. Plus, a pledge to take up immigration reform and climate change in the near future. Any one of those things would be a significant agenda,"" he said. But some Republicans say the president has failed when it comes to his pledge to reach across the aisle. After Democrats moved ahead with a $787 billion stimulus bill that garnered no Republican support in the House and just three Republican votes in the Senate, ""That's when it became clear to me that all of this post-partisan talk and working down the middle and working together was a ruse,"" said John Boehner, House minority leader. Obama's approval ratings remain high -- hovering around 65 percent. Those numbers are on par with where President Reagan and President Carter stood at this point in their presidencies. But one year later, their approval ratings dropped to about 40 percent. Obama has maintained his popularity, Republican strategist and CNN contributor Mary Matalin said, but he's lost support from Republicans and some independents ""because what he is not is what he was perceived to be in the campaign -- a centrist."" Schneider said Obama's agenda -- which includes massive government spending -- represents a challenge to the Republicans' core principle of smaller government. Republicans haven't responded to Obama's outreach, and ""it's causing serious political damage to their party, he said.  Watch: Is bipartisanship dead? » . Obama is not personally polarizing in part because he is cautious about divisive social issues, ""but his economic policies are very divisive,"" Schneider said. ""Obama is the mirror image of Bill Clinton ... Voters either loved him or hated him,"" he said, noting that after his first two years, Clinton's policies became more moderate and consensus driven. The National Republican Senatorial Committee last month released an ad accusing Obama of backpedaling on numerous campaign promises, calling him out for signing a spending bill with thousands of earmarks, mishandling the AIG bonus scandal and failing to rein in government spending. PolitiFact, a Web site that has been keeping track of Obama's campaign promises, reports that Obama has kept 27 promises, compromised on seven, broken six, stalled on three, has 67 in the works and has yet to take action on another 408. But one Republican who broke ranks to endorse Obama and also spoke at the Democratic convention says he's had no regrets. ""As president, in surprisingly short order, he has moved rather decisively to implement new directions,"" said former Iowa Rep. Jim Leach, who served as a Republican member of the House for 30 years. And on areas where Obama hasn't been 100 percent in line with his campaign promises -- such as softening his stance on NAFTA and slightly extending his timeline for troop withdrawal -- Leach said Obama is making adjustments ""in a very appropriately adaptive way."" ""It is inconceivable that a thinking individual can agree with the president or anyone in public office 100 percent of the time,"" he said, adding that he thinks Obama has some prospect of ""potentially going down as one of the great presidents in American history."" Rep. Lincoln Davis, D-Tennessee, who declined to endorse Obama before his party's convention, said Obama has met expectations thus far. ""I think every person who runs for office -- whether it's a local office, statewide office, runs for president -- we all have ideas, we all have visions, we all have a hope,"" Davis said. ""But then acting on those is sometimes more difficult than others. But I do believe the president, during the campaign, made his visions known ... and I think he has certainly lived up to those."" Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ed Rollins said if he were a Democrat, he might give Obama an ""A"" on his performance. ""I think the guy has had a great start. He's pushing an agenda that obviously he ran on. He's lived up to most of his promises. You know, he's a big personality, and I don't diminish that,"" he said. ""I think the country wants a president they feel comfortable with. A long, hard path ahead, and hopefully, some of the stuff he's thrown out there will work because we're spending a ton of taxpayers' money,""  he said, noting that as a Republican he gives Obama a ""B."" Brinkley said it's somewhat unfair to hold the president to a 100-day litmus test because ""it takes a while to get settled in."" ""He's doing a lot of bold things for as short a period of 100 days,"" he said, pointing specifically to Obama's economic bailouts. But, he said, there's the large caveat that only time will tell how these bold moves will play out.","As a candidate, Obama campaigned on a message of hope and change .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- How does the American public feel about the war in Afghanistan? In a word, wary. U.S. forces have been engaged in fierce fighting to oust the Taliban in Afghanistan. President Obama on Friday announced his strategy to fight terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, a plan that includes more troops, new legislation, improved troop training and added civilian expertise. ""The United States of American did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan. Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11, 2001,"" Obama said Friday. ""We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan,"" he said. Stressing that ""the safety of people around the world is at stake,"" Obama said the ""situation is increasingly perilous"" in the region in and around Afghanistan, where the United States has been fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban for more than 7½ years after attacks in New York and at the Pentagon. Nevertheless, the American public has been wary about the war in Afghanistan, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted in February.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider break down the numbers » . Last month, Americans were almost evenly divided between those who support the war and those who oppose it, the poll showed, with 47 percent in favor and 51 percent opposed. Opposition to the war in Afghanistan is more muted than opposition to the war in Iraq, but it's not so muted among Democrats. Two-thirds of Americans overall oppose the war in Iraq, but 64 percent of Democrats oppose the war in Afghanistan. The anti-war movements in Vietnam and Iraq helped define what the Democratic Party stands for.  Watch: Is Afghanistan Obama's Vietnam? » . ""If we don't learn from our Iraq experience, we are doomed to repeat it,"" Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-California, said on the House floor Thursday. Why are Americans wary about Afghanistan? The recession. Iraq War fatigue. And frustration. Only 31 percent of Americans believe the United States is winning the war in Afghanistan. Fifty percent believe the United States is winning in Iraq -- the highest number in at least five years. But Americans still want to get out of Iraq. Last month, when President Obama said he would send 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, the public was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Democrats were willing to go along with the president, but they were less enthusiastic than Republicans . A solid majority of Americans believe the United States can win a military victory in Afghanistan, but Afghanistan has become a political war. Winning depends, not just on what the United States can do, but also what Afghanistan and Pakistan can do. Americans have far less confidence in them. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll surveyed 1,046 adult Americans by telephone on February 18-19, 2009. The sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","Americans almost evenly divided on opinion of Afghanistan war, poll shows .

"Editor's note: With fears of a swine flu pandemic rising daily, CNN Pentagon producer Larry Shaughnessy remembered a batch of letters from his grandfather, a World War I soldier who battled the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919. Martin ""Al"" Culhane, left, is pictured with his older brother, Frank, around 1918 or 1919. WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- ""I'm coming, I'm coming For my head is bending low I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe"" As World War I rages in Europe, fresh U.S. Army soldiers pass the time on a train ride to to Camp Forrest, Georgia. ""The boys are just starting to sing,"" Martin Aloysius Culhane wrote on September 6, 1918, to his friend back home. ""They've gotten back to 'Old Black Joe' so far."" Stephen Foster's classic song from the Civil War is about the death of slaves who had become his friends. But Culhane, known as ""Al,"" and the soldiers who sang along could not know how much death would hunt the recruits on that train, most of whom never made it to Europe to fight in the Great War. They would find themselves in the deadliest influenza pandemic in history. Culhane's letters to his older brother Frank and his long-time ""chum"" Clif Pinter are a young soldier's firsthand account of life as a draftee private and how he coped with a disease that would haunt Army camps around the United States and eventually infect people around the world. Some estimates say as many as 50 million people were killed by what's called the Spanish influenza in 1918 and 1919, far more than the number killed in combat during the war. Three weeks after the train trip to Georgia, Culhane, a 21-year-old clothing salesman from Chicago, Illinois, writes again. Already the flu occupies his thoughts.  Learn more about the current swine flu » . ""Received a nice letter from Phil Byrne he reports he is getting along fine, is feeling better than he has ever before."" Byrne, a friend from Chicago, was one of the early survivors of the Spanish flu. Other members of the Byrne family took ill a few months later, according to the letters. In the same letter he mentions how the Army was trying to protect the troops at Camp Forrest: . ""Since noon today our camp has been under quarantine to prevent an epidemic of Spanish influenza. We have had no cases thus far but it is the intention of the medical officers to prevent any case of the disease from making an appearance. All the men who have even slight colds have been put into separate barrack which, of course, were immediately christened 'the TB ward' by the rest of the company."" That same day, September 28, 1918, he wrote his brother Frank, a Navy sailor at home awaiting orders, ""Well the Spanish Influenza has made an appearance here and we are under strict orders no visits to Chattanooga, we are certainly the hard luck guys when it comes to this quarantine proposition."" At first the threat of Spanish flu is just an inconvenience for Culhane: ""I am just about fed up with staying in a district about a block square for three weeks. There is no canteen in the quarantine district and we have a hell of a time getting small supplies."" Just six days after complaining about the inconvenience, a brief but frightening note: ""Receive the enclosed letter for your information then see that Frank gets it unknown to the rest of the family."" What Culhane didn't want his mother, sister and younger brother to know was that he was in the infirmary with the Spanish flu. He asks his friend Clif to write often and encourage letters from ""my friends, without of course, telling them that I am a little under the weather."" His euphemism hid the fact that in some places more than 30 percent of people who contracted Spanish flu died. In the United States the mortality rate was lower, but still a devastating 3 percent. It was a crisis for the Army. Military bases, with thousands of men from all over the country in tightly packed barracks, were fertile breeding grounds for the flu, especially one as easily spread as this one. And unlike most flu strains that mostly strike the elderly, the very young or the sick, Spanish flu hit healthy, young adults like Army draftees. Just three days after telling his friend about being sick, Culhane wrote that he was feeling better. ""I am still in quarantine but will be released today. I am feeling great and the two day's rest has done me a world of good. I have done nothing at all but sit in the shade, read and write letters."" His recovery from the Spanish flu was swift, but the very next day, October 7, 1918, he wrote to give ""all the details of the death of a very good friend, my Bunkie, Thomas Birdie. His body will go north today, I think,"" Culhane wrote, asking Pinter to attend the wake. ""At his side, say a few prayers for the repose of his soul."" When not writing about the flu, Culhane dropped none-too-subtle hints about wanting care packages full of cookies from home. And he regularly questioned why other friends didn't write. He also worried that he was ""neglecting the ladies."" He pelts his friend Clif with questions about Ursula (""Her Majesty,"" he jokingly refers to her), Ella (the young woman to whom he promised a prized golf club) Ida (""I had a long letter from Ida Flynn. Boy! I will have a job on my hands when I get home"") and the Marys (Mary Rose, Mary English, Mary Anne). While Culhane writes about and to a lot of young ladies, there is no sign in the letters which one, if any, held a special place in his heart. Still he worried about one young man named ""Hank"" who remained in Chicago. ""Keep the ladies amused by all means, but I look to you to protect my interests. Hank is too darn nice a chap to be safe around the ladies. However, if he seems to get extra strong I will write a note and have him made Admiral of the Arctic Circle."" After recovering from the flu, Culhane bemoans the fact that war was about to end. ""It is almost over now and thirty days will see at least a cessation of hostilities. Xmas will see peace. I will never see France and as long as that is impossible I might as well be out of the Army as soon as it is over."" Nine days later, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month the war ended. And just four days after the fighting in Europe ended, the letters from Camp Forrest stopped. Al Culhane was sick again. This time he was taken to U.S. General Hospital #14 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. And he couldn't keep the latest illness a secret from his family back home in Chicago. A Catholic chaplain wrote the family that he was sick and not able to write himself. When he was well enough, he wrote Pinter, ""I don't know just what I have but it felt like old fashioned grip or perhaps 'The Flu.'"". It took about two weeks before he was out of the Fort Oglethorpe hospital and back at Camp Forrest. He had twice survived the deadliest flu in history and lived to write home about it. After his second recovery his concerns turned to getting back to Chicago by Christmas. ""Clif I have seen my discharge all written out and from that moment on my usefulness as a soldier ceased."" But again illness got in the way. This time it was a completely different one: ""Measles has broken out in our company and we are quarantined. Did you ever hear of harder luck in all your life?"" Culhane didn't make it back to Chicago for Christmas. But he eventually did return home alive and well. He never did make it to France, but traveled the United States extensively with his wife, Evelyn, a woman never mentioned in his letters home, but someone he'd known since they went through First Holy Communion together. As for Clif Pinter, who saved the letters, he and Al Culhane remained ""old chums"" for life. After Pinter's death, his son passed the letters on to Al's daughter, Dorothy Clarke, who passed them onto Al's grandchildren, including Lawrence Aloysius Shaughnessy, who works for CNN's Pentagon unit and occasionally writes stories about soldiers for CNN.com.","U.S. soldier survived Spanish flu pandemic not once, but twice .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- College football's perennial armchair-quarterback argument over the need for a clear-cut national champion came to Capitol Hill Friday. College football teams play in the BCS for the national championship trophy. The House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection held a hearing to dissect the Bowl Championship Series, asking whether the model needs to be tweaked, overhauled or done away with altogether. Four witnesses testified at the morning hearing, including championship series coordinator John Swofford and Alamo Bowl President Derrick Fox; both of whom defended the current system, though Fox conceded that ""no system is perfect and the Bowl Championship Series is not perfect."" Mountain West Conference Commissioner Craig Thompson and Boise State Athletic Director Gene Bleymaier testified that they would like to see the system revamped. Many critics say they want college football to have a playoff system to ensure that a champion is clearly defined. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, called the Bowl Championship Series format unfair and perhaps took it one step further. ""You should either change your name to BES for Bowl Exhibition System or just drop the C and call it the BS system, because it is not about determining the championship on the field."" Both sides were cordial but opinionated. Fox said he would prefer Washington not get involved. ""Those who don't like the current system will say that's the way of the world, but we don't believe that government should have any role in promoting a demise of the bowl games."" Currently, 11 college conferences and three independents compete in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision -- formerly Division I-A. Six of those 11 conferences are guaranteed spots in the four Bowl Championship Series games. Schools from conferences that critics say are unfairly deemed as low profile are then left to fight their way into those prestige games. They share in significantly less of the series money and have less of an opportunity to challenge for the national title. President Obama is one of the proponents of a college football playoff. In an interview with ESPN in November, Obama said he's had just about enough of the Bowl Championship Series. ""I'm fed up with these computer rankings and this, that and the other. Get eight teams -- the top eight teams right at the end. You got a playoff. Decide on a national champion,"" Obama said. Before heading out early to catch a flight, Barton made it clear that he expects to see college football change its ways or risk having lawmakers introduce legislation to impose change for them. ""I think there is better than a 50 percent chance that if we don't see some action in the next two months on a voluntary switch to a playoff system that you will see this bill move,"" he said.","Bowl Championship Series decides college football's national champ .
Perennial argument is that a playoff system would be a better way to decide .

"(CNN) -- Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius was sworn in Tuesday night as secretary of Health and Human Services. Kathleen Sebelius dives into discussing the swine flu at the White House after being sworn in. She was sworn after she was confirmed by the Senate in a 65-31 vote. The timely vote puts Sebelius in office as the Obama administration is up against its first public health outbreak. She steps into the role as swine flu numbers climb worldwide. As of Tuesday morning, at least 90 cases had been confirmed, including 50 in the United States. Until her confirmation, the White House, which declared a public health emergency Sunday, was dealing with its first crisis without a secretary. But the administration said it was equipped to handle the situation. There are still no appointees in place for any of the department's 18 key positions. Related: White House health team not complete . In most cases where a position is awaiting Senate confirmation, that job is filled by a career civil servant in an interim capacity. The Obama administration has named five nominees for the open positions. Sebelius met several obstacles during her confirmation hearings. The Kansas governor came under fire for her ties to Dr. George Tiller, a late-term abortion provider. Tiller and his staff attended a 2007 reception Sebelius held at the governor's mansion in Topeka. Sebelius originally failed to account for donations she received from the doctor. Sebelius also revealed in March that she recently paid nearly $8,000 in back taxes and interest. She said she had errors in her 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax returns. Sebelius, 60, is the daughter of former Ohio Gov. John Gilligan, who led that state from 1971 to 1975. A two-term Democratic governor in a Republican-leaning state, she previously served as a state insurance commissioner and oversaw Kansas' Medicaid program. She has been credited with boosting health care assistance for the poor during her tenure. A number of leading social conservatives have criticized Sebelius for her record on abortion, citing, among other things, her veto as governor of legislation that would have tightened abortion regulations in Kansas. In vetoing the measure last April, Sebelius wrote that the bill was problematic because it included no exceptions for pregnancies that endanger a woman's life and it allowed individuals to seek court orders preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion, even if the procedure was necessary to save her life. Some Republicans, however, have strongly defended Sebelius. Former Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, also from Kansas, testified on Sebelius' behalf in March, arguing that her record had proven her ability to work in a bipartisan manner. ""Sebelius' strength is that she understands health care [and is] willing and able ... to bring parties together in very critical areas,"" he said. Kansas GOP Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback, as well as Republican Govs. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Jon Huntsman of Utah commended her selection. Former Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Obama's first choice for secretary of health and human services, withdrew on February 3 after controversy erupted over his tax records and over his work in a field that some consider lobbying.","Kathleen Sebelius sworn in after being confirmed by 65-31 vote .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The 15th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda brought American U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to tears as she reflected on her personal memories surrounding the slaughter. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice recalls her time in Rwanda working for the Clinton administration. Rice visited Rwanda as a staff member in former President Bill Clinton's National Security Council six months after the ethnic cleansing. She explained how even months after the violence she encountered decomposing bodies at one of the massacre sites. ""For me, the memory of stepping around and over those corpses will remain the most searing reminder imaginable of what our work here must aim to prevent,"" she said Tuesday at a special commemorative event at United Nations headquarters in New York. She emotionally concluded her remarks, expressing how ""We bow our heads to mark the memory of those who were slain. And we bow our heads to mark the sorrow of all who stood by."" The mass killings began on April 6, 1994, when tribal Hutu militia members attacked their tribal Tutsi countrymen after the plane of then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down. Within 100 days, some 800,000 people were murdered. In addition to Rice, various dignitaries, ambassadors, artists, U.N. officials and genocide survivors gathered Tuesday to mark the tragic circumstances that began 15 years ago. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reminded the audience how the Rwandan genocide continues to haunt ""our collective conscience"" and that ""the prevention of genocide is a collective responsibility."" Ban encouraged the world community to remember its shared duty to prevent future catastrophes in the name of humanity and in honor of the memory of those who died. The United Nations created a Special Representative for the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities in 2004. President Obama also released a statement coinciding with Tuesday's anniversary. Obama praised survivors for their remarkable strength, but emphasized the tragedy should always be remembered because each victim ""had their own story, their own family, and their own dreams.""","U.N.

"(CNN) -- Five people were killed Thursday after a man tried to attack the Dutch royal family during a Queen's Day celebration by crashing his car near the royal family's bus, Dutch police said. A car is pictured after crashing into the crowd waiting for the visit of the royal family in Apeldoorn. Authorities are not releasing the name of the man, but said they have charged him with with trying to attack the royal family. Twelve people were injured in the incident in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn, about 45 miles east of Amsterdam, police spokeswoman Esther Naber told CNN. Crowds had lined the streets to see Queen Beatrix and her family ride by in an open-top bus during the Netherlands' annual holiday. As the bus moved along, a black hatchback zoomed past it. The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the car went by. The car crashed into the low metal railing around a column on the side of the road. The vehicle appeared heavily damaged even before the crash, but the reason for that was unclear. There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, Naber said. Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped, then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving. The driver is in the hospital, badly injured, Naber said. He is among the five seriously hurt -- three men and two women. Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba. The tradition started in 1885 and celebrates the birthday of the queen. Although Queen Beatrix's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday April 30, according to the Dutch government. Queen's Day is known for its free market all over the country, where anybody is allowed to sell things in the streets. Other activities include children's games and musical performances.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An al Qaeda suspect alleged to have been involved in the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania that killed 11 people faces war crimes charges, the Pentagon announced Monday. Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani is shown in a photo posted by the FBI in 2004. The bombing in Dar es Salaam, which also wounded hundreds, was one of two carried out nearly simultaneously on August 7, 1998. One in Nairobi, Kenya, killed 213 people. Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, from Tanzania, faces nine charges, six of them offenses that could carry the death penalty if he is convicted by a military tribunal. He was captured by Pakistan in 2004 and is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In a written announcement, the Pentagon said Ghailani is ""charged with the following substantive offenses: murder in violation of the Law of War, murder of protected persons, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property in violation of the Law of War and terrorism. In addition, he is charged with conspiracy to commit all of the above offenses. ""Ghailani is further charged with providing material support to terrorism. This charge alleges that after the bombing, Ghailani continued in his service to al Qaeda as a document forger, physical trainer at an al Qaeda training camp, and as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden."" The charges say he purchased bomb components, scouted the embassy with the suicide bomb driver, met with co-conspirators, and fled to Karachi, Pakistan, one day before the bombing. The convening authority for military commissions, Susan J. Crawford, will determine whether probable cause exists for a trial by military commission, said Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartman of the Office of Military Commissions. For Ghailani to ultimately be sentenced to death, the 12-member jury would have to unanimously find him guilty, determine that aggravating factors apply, and concur on the death sentence, Hartman told reporters at the Pentagon. ""Everything has to be unanimous."" ""And then there are four levels of post-trial review, which is an extraordinary set of rights available,"" he said. In December, 1998 -- a few months after the embassy bombings -- Ghailani and three other fugitives were indicted in U.S. District Court in New York. It is not known whether he may ultimately face a federal trial.  E-mail to a friend .","1998 bombing in Dar es Salaam killed 11, injured hundreds .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Carrie Prejean, the Miss USA contestant from California who declared her opposition to same-sex marriage on the pageant stage, will star in a new $1.5 million ad campaign funded by the National Organization for Marriage. Miss California USA Carrie Prejean has gotten support from many same-sex marriage opponents. Prejean appeared Thursday at a news conference in Washington to unveil the ad, called ""No Offense."" Prejean was roasted by same-sex marriage advocates after she stood up for what she called ""opposite marriage"" (marriage between a man and a woman) when responding to a question from celebrity blogger Perez Hilton during the pageant. But she's also become a fresh-faced standard-bearer for same-sex marriage opponents, who have rallied to her defense. ""Marriage is good,"" Prejean said at the news conference. ""There is something special about unions of husband and wife. Unless we bring men and women together, children will not have mothers and fathers."" ""She is attacked viciously for having the courage to speak up for her truth and her values,"" the National Organization for Marriage said in a press release. ""But Carrie's courage inspired a whole nation and a whole generation of young people because she chose to risk the Miss USA crown rather than be silent about her deepest moral values."" ""This vision of marriage is not hateful,"" Prejean said. ""It's not discriminatory. It's good."" Although she claimed that her view represents that of the majority of Americans, Prejean said she has no plan ""on getting into politics anytime soon, that's for sure."" According to the group, the ad will call ""gay marriage advocates to account for their unwillingness to debate the real issue: gay marriage has consequences."" The Miss California USA TV ad is the group's second. Its first, called ""A Gathering Storm,"" ran in several states and featured actors issuing ominous warnings about the threats posed by same-sex marriage. Executive directors and producers of the Miss California USA pageant released a statement Wednesday lamenting that Prejean had taken on such a ""polarizing"" issue. ""We are deeply saddened Carrie Prejean has forgotten her platform of the Special Olympics, her commitment to all Californians and solidified her legacy as one that goes beyond the rights to voice her beliefs and instead reveals her opportunistic agenda,"" the group said.

"(CNN) -- Police are examining grainy hotel surveillance video and following up on new leads, including a reported sighting, in the case of a 17-year-old girl who traveled to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for spring break last week and then disappeared. Brittanee Marie Drexel's mother says she thought her daughter was at a beach in New York, not South Carolina. The possible sighting of Brittanee Drexel was on a bus Wednesday morning in the Myrtle Beach area, according to police, who later showed photos of her to passengers. As investigators try to build a timeline of the events leading to Brittanee's disappearance Saturday night, they are also scrutinizing hotel security video for signs of a young woman in distress, or other clues. Brittanee's mother, Dawn Drexel, told HLN's Nancy Grace that she had forbidden the Rochester, New York, high school junior from going to Myrtle Beach, a popular destination for high school and college students on spring break. Although they stayed in touch by phone and spoke on Saturday, Drexel said she believed the girl was in Rochester when she actually was in Myrtle Beach. ""I didn't have any idea that she was going to do this,"" Drexel said. ""I do trust my daughter, and she needed to cool down a little bit because she was upset that I wasn't going to let her go."" Drexel said her daughter rode there in a car with several friends. She thinks Brittanee used money she had earned and borrowed to finance her trip.","Police show girl's photo to bus passengers after reported sighting .

"Editor's note: Dina Habib Powell, global head of corporate engagement at Goldman Sachs, served as U.S. assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs from 2005 to 2007. Dina Habib Powell says there are encouraging signs the world is ready to invest in empowering women. NEW YORK (CNN) -- As we mark International Women's Month in March, it is encouraging to see that the movement to recognize the vital role that women play in families, nations and economies has been building for more than a decade and that developments in the past few years have shown that real progress has begun to take hold. On the heels of International Women's Day, President Obama said Monday, ""we will not sow the seeds for a brighter future or reap the benefits of the change we need without the full and active participation of women around the world."" He also recently announced the creation of a new position, ambassador-at-large for global women's Issues, at the State Department. To fill this critical role, the president nominated Melanne Verveer, a widely respected women's advocate and former top aide to then first lady Hillary Clinton. Verveer was a founder of Vital Voices Global Partnership, an organization committed to empowering women and recently co-chaired by Secretary Clinton and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. There has also been very recent progress on Capitol Hill. Last month, the U.S. Senate created a Foreign Relations subcommittee that will focus on the global status of women, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California. The efforts have been a bipartisan priority for our leaders. In 2008, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice successfully led the effort in the U.N. Security Council to officially recognize rape as a weapon of war. And in 2001, Laura Bush used the first presidential radio address ever given by a first lady to focus international attention on the plight of women in Afghanistan and used her influence to protect and empower women around the world. Critical strides are also being made globally. In Rwanda, a country devastated by genocide, women have become a key part of the nation's rebirth. Under the leadership of President Paul Kagame, more than half of the parliament is made up of women. In Liberia, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf made history when she became the first female president on the African continent. In the Middle East, Kuwait has emerged as a leader in women's suffrage and political participation. And in the United Arab Emirates, women such as Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi, minister of foreign trade, have been trailblazers for progress throughout the region. This social change is being promoted at the United Nations, where Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently noted that the protection, education and empowerment of women and girls are among the most important ingredients to achieving all other Millennium Development Goals. Such consensus should not be surprising as study after study has found that investing in the education of women improves lives. Every extra year of girls' education can reduce infant mortality by 5 to 10 percent. In Africa, children of mothers who receive five years of primary education are 40 percent more likely to live beyond age 5. And multicountry data show educated mothers are about 50 percent more likely to immunize their children than uneducated mothers are. But one of the most important developments of recent years has been the increasing amount of research that shows investments in women can offer not only social benefits, but also real economic growth. A growing body of evidence highlights the economic advantage of educating and empowering women. The private sector has seized on this data. There is now broad consensus that investing in women is not only just good social policy, it is ""smart economics,"" as Bob Zoellick, president of the World Bank, says. Toward that end, the World Bank has convened a Private Sector Leaders Forum with companies committed to these issues, such as Standard Chartered, Cisco, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, Carlson and Nike. My own firm, Goldman Sachs, published two critical pieces of research, ""Womenomics"" and ""Women Hold Up Half the Sky,"" which found that investments in women -- through increased education and labor force participation -- can lead to real economic growth in developed and developing countries. Specifically, this research found that a 1 percentage point increase in female education raises the average level of gross domestic product by .37 and raises annual GDP growth rates by .2 on average. Such findings led to the development of 10,000 Women, an initiative that is working with a global network of leading academic and nonprofit partners to provide women at home and abroad with quality management and entrepreneurial education. This education is helping to create a greater number of female-owned small and medium enterprises, and a new generation of leaders poised to have exponential impact. One recent graduate of the program, Tuokpe Esisi, a fashion designer from Nigeria, has already increased her revenues, and immediately invested a portion of her profits to provide tutors for the illiterate male tailors she employs. This not only positions her enterprise for greater growth, but is also a perfect demonstration of the multiplier effect of investing in women. Organizations such as Women for Women International, Camfed and the International Center for Research on Women have long touted this multiplier effect and are supported by private-public partnerships dedicated to the promotion of women leaders. For example, the State Department, with the help of Vital Voices, instituted a mentoring program for the past four years with Fortune's Most Powerful Women. The program pairs leading U.S. executives -- such as Ann Moore (Time Inc), Pat Woertz (ADM), Helene Gayle (Care) and Anne Mulcahy (Xerox) -- with rising female entrepreneurs in developing countries. At the dawn of the 20th century, Egyptian poet Hafez Ibrahim said: ""When you educate a woman, you create a nation."" Nearly a century later, the cause of women's empowerment has never been more important. As New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof recently put it, gender inequality is ""the dominant moral challenge we face in the 21st century."" This challenge also presents an opportunity we cannot afford to squander. We should seize this moment and this momentum. There is tremendous work to be done, but history has shown us that women will not let us down. They will take up the challenge and build up their families, their villages and ultimately all our nations. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Dina Habib Powell.","Dina Powell: As we mark Women's Month, there are encouraging signs .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military continued its assault Thursday on militants in Taliban-held areas, its chief spokesman told reporters. Pakistani army trucks move military equipment into the troubled Buner district Thursday. So far, 14 militants have been killed in the past 24 hours, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said. The operation is still ongoing in the districts of Dir and Buner, which was recently seized by the Taliban in violation of an agreement with Pakistan's government. Pakistani forces have completely secured Daggar, the main town in Buner and the scene of heavy fighting on Wednesday, Abbas said. The Daggar operation resulted in the deaths of 50 militants, but freed 18 Frontier Corps personnel who had been abducted by militants, he said. Fifty-two of their colleagues are still believed to be held by their suspected Taliban kidnappers. This week's military operation has resulted in more than 180 militant casualties since Sunday, while the military has suffered one death and one injury, according to Abbas. He said he hopes the operation will be completed by the end of the week. Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters, communication equipment and night vision technology, Abbas said Thursday. Most of this week's casualties happened on Tuesday, when Pakistani fighter jets launched airstrikes, killing at least 70 militants in the Dir district, according to the Pakistani military. The operation is part of the Pakistani army's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, which have rankled relations between the two countries. The military campaign has apparently not stopped Washington from carrying out unmanned drone attacks on Pakistan's soil. A suspected unmanned aerial vehicle killed six people Wednesday night in the village of Kaniguran in the tribal district of South Waziristan near the border with Afghanistan, Pakistani intelligence sources said. Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are American airstrikes on its territory. The U.S. military in Afghanistan has not commented on the strikes, which typically target Taliban fighters in the border region. But the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled drones. U.S. President Barack Obama is ""gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan,"" he told reporters Wednesday night. Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office, Obama said the United States has ""huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable"" and doesn't end up a ""nuclear-armed militant state."" But he stressed he was more concerned about the ability of Pakistan's civilian government to ""deliver basic services,"" and not ""that they're immediately going to be overrun"" by the Taliban. Pakistan's recent military crackdown has led to an exodus of civilians from the region. At least 33,000 residents have left their homes in the midst of the recent fighting, according to Amnesty International. Civilians fleeing from Lower Dir in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province join more than 500,000 people already displaced by the fighting, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The Pakistani military completed its operation to eliminate and expel militants in Dir Tuesday, and is now focusing on the Buner district, Abbas said. About 300 militants entered Buner a few days ago, in violation of the Taliban's recent agreement to leave the district, he said. Buner is about 60 miles from Islamabad, but Abbas said the militants pose no threat of entering the capital. The fighter jets pounded targets in Buner and the Swat Valley in an effort to block the militants' entry and exit points, according to Abbas. CNN's Samson Desta, Ivan Watson, and Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Pakistani military intensifies drive against Taliban in restive tribal regions .

"(CNN) -- Lectures, slide shows and notes are often boring, but people are using technology to find entertainment in these unlikely places. Spoof notes of ""Star Wars"" are scribbled into a fun online ""pencast."" Some use high-tech pens to track presentations. Others share PowerPoints in slide show form online. These technologically spiced-up presentations seem to be getting more attention these days. They're also creating buzz about what the future of presentations might hold. Consider ""pencasts,"" which are made using the Pulse SmartPen and specially gridded paper, both sold by the California startup Livescribe. The pen writes like an ordinary pen but also has a voice recorder, and it ""notes"" (so to speak) which notes were taken at which point in the recording. Some quirky SmartPen presentations come off as comedy sketches. One popular presentation muses about how George Lucas might have come up with the idea for Star Wars. Some university students love the technology because they can record and play back what their professor was saying at an exact point in their notes -- which is especially useful when you can't read your own writing. And many professors are all for it, too. ""I feel like this is one of those 'Rear View Mirror' moments in which a new technology comes into our lives with enormous potential and we just don't know what to do with it yet,"" blogs Michael Wesch, a cultural anthropology and digital ethnography professor at Kansas State University. ""We think of it in terms of what we know (pen and paper) and fail to recognize the potential."" That potential -- for entertainment and serious uses alike -- can be gleaned from pencasts posted on the Livescribe Web site's community section, which is about a year old. The pencasts posted there have collectively received more than 1.5 million views. Soon, it will be easier to embed pencasts on other sites, like personal blogs, the company says. Slide shows are further along in popularity. A startup called SlideShare launched in late 2006 with the idea of allowing people to easily share their PowerPoint presentations. Its site had more than 15 million visitors last month, and its 2008 contest for the best presentations showed off the form's potential. The best are far removed from the dull bullet-point presentations you might have fallen asleep to. Many use dramatic images, striking design and memorable phrases. Former Vice President Al Gore developed his presentation on the planet's environmental challenges into the Academy Award-winning documentary and best-selling book ""An Inconvenient Truth."" Last year's top SlideShare presentation, called ""Thirst,"" highlights the looming water crisis and has nearly 200,000 views. Others are more light-hearted. The No. 2 spot (with more than 60,000 views) went to a presentation called ""Foot Notes."" It shows pictures of the narrator's feet in various places she's been (like on cobblestone corridors in Prague and a dance floor in Chicago), interspersed with inspiring quotes related to feet and walking. Finally, for many people, the most dreaded, boring form of communication of all is the lecture. But then, how to explain the popularity of the TED videos? TED stands for Technology, Entertainment, Design. The conference started in the mid-'80s and has become a networking event of sorts for the world's best and brightest. Dozens of speakers give presentations of about 20 minutes each -- the perfect duration for a juicy ""media snack."" TED.com started introducing TEDTalks to the public for free in July 2006, and by the following year, there were more than a hundred talks dating back to 2002. Broken down into dozens of themes, today they're popular fodder for video iPods. In one, the amputee athlete and model Aimee Mullins talks about how her many pairs of artificial legs often beat having a single pair of regular ones -- some make her taller, others are works of art. In another, Jill Tarter, an astronomer and director of the Center for SETI Research, discusses how insanely large the universe is and what a ""waste of space"" it would be if life on Earth were indeed all there is. It's hard to watch a handful of TED videos and not feel your perspective broadening. That helps explain how, despite the lecture format, TEDTalks has become hugely popular. A few months ago, the videos surpassed the 100 million views mark -- not bad for a bunch of lectures.","Technology injects new life into a dull medium: presentations .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- An Iraqi soldier fatally shot two American soldiers and wounded three others on Saturday, the U.S. military said. A man lies in a hospital after a roadside bombing near Kirkurk on Saturday. Three Iraqis were killed. The shooter was killed when U.S. soldiers returned fire, Maj. Derrick Cheng told CNN. The incident took place at a combat outpost just south of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, where there has been a strong presence of anti-U.S. militants, and it underscored the dangers for U.S. troops and Iraqi security forces in that city. A second gunman also fired on other U.S. soldiers at the outpost and fled, said Cheng, a spokesman for the U.S.-led Multi National Division-North. Iraq's Interior Ministry said the gunman was a soldier in training who was standing close to U.S. soldiers when he aimed his firearm at them and began shooting. There have been similar incidents of men in Iraqi security force uniforms in the Mosul area opening fire on U.S. troops. In February, insurgents dressed as Iraqi police officers killed a U.S. soldier and an interpreter in the city. Asked whether there seems to be a rise in such attacks, Cheng replied, ""We still view these as isolated incidents either by individuals posing as Iraqi Security Forces or members acting out on their own."" ""These events do not represent the overall relationship or partnership U.S. forces have with our Iraqi counterparts."" Overall, violence and attacks are down in Iraq, but despite improvements in the big picture, the U.S. military is concerned with hot spots such as Mosul. Maj. Gen. David Perkins, MNF-Iraq spokesman, told reporters on Friday that the city remains a danger. He said the U.S. military is studying whether American combat troops scheduled to withdraw from urban centers in Iraq by June 30 should actually remain in the diverse metropolis -- populated by Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Christians and others. Perkins said al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) militants ""are transitioning and becoming more and more concentrated ... mainly in Mosul and in Baghdad."" ""What we have always said with regards to al Qaeda is that strategically for AQI to win they have to win Baghdad and for them to survive they have to hold on to Mosul and you can see that by how they are conducting their attacks."" In the last couple of weeks, he said, militants have focused their activity on Baghdad, and attacks in Mosul have dropped somewhat. ""But there is still a lot activity. This is probably the main area we are looking at that could possibly result in U.S. forces being there,"" he said of Mosul. ""Probably more so than any other place."" ""Of all the places in Iraq, it is the area that you would most likely possibly see a very similar U.S. presence to what you see now. But only if Iraqis want that."" U.S. troop fatalities in Iraq last month reached 18, the highest of the year. However, the number of monthly Iraqi troop deaths have plummeted since earlier in the war. Also on Saturday, Iranian forces targeting Kurdish rebels shelled a village in Iraq, an official from Iraq's Kurdish region said. Forces used helicopters to attack the village and shelled it with artillery. The village is just over the Iranian border in Iraq's Sulaimaniya province -- a Kurdish region. No casualties were reported. Iran and Turkey long have targeted Kurdish separatist rebels operating in northern Iraq. Meanwhile in Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, three civilians were killed and three others were wounded when a roadside bomb struck their vehicle on Saturday, police said. It is not known who the bomb might have been targeting, but the incident reflects the hostilities in the oil-rich and ethnically diverse city.","NEW: U.S. military: Gunman who killed 2 U.S. troops, wounded 3 was Iraqi soldier .

"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to New Hampshire, where diner patrons shared their thoughts on President Obama and the economy. The Tilt'n Diner hosted all the major presidential candidates during the primaries in 2008. TILTON, New Hampshire (CNN)  -- Kate O'Leary voted for Barack Obama and began the year full of energy. But her hope is giving way these days to a sense that some things never change. ""I trust his motives,"" she said of President Obama. ""I feel like he is an honorable guy, I am not sure if he can do it. That's the problem."" Too much too soon is one of her worries. Too much politics as usual is another. Add in too much bailout money and Kate O'Leary is more sober now than she was when Obama took the oath of office. Across from O'Leary sat Debbie Lurvey, who took a job at the Tilt'n Diner after losing her job in the mortgage business. ""It was a forced unemployment because of the economy,"" Lurvey said. ""So, you know, I decided that it was best to move on to something a little more stable."" O'Leary and Lurvey are among those who think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better. But our third guest for our weekly diner conversation, Jim Wells, isn't so sure. ""I think most of it is psychological,"" said Wells, a Republican who believes consumers need to be more confident. ""The secret out of a recession like this is to spend money. And you have got to spend your own, you can't expect somebody else to spend it for you."" He makes the distinction between consumer spending and what he sees as too much government spending. ""We are going to have to pay the bill in another two or three years and it is going to be scary when it happens,"" Wells said. All three agreed one thing missing from Washington is a spirit of cooperation and compromise. Lurvey said the pain of losing her job and dealing with foreclosure have taught her there are some things the government can't do. ""It is a good time to get back to what this country was made on -- it's the family,"" she said. ""And you know I think for awhile we were all going crazy and overspending and living beyond our means and this has kind of been a reality check for most people.""","Diner patron Kate O'Leary likes Obama, but doubts how much change he can bring .

"The swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus, is all over the news. A string of cases have been reported across the United States, as well as across the globe, with Mexico the hardest hit country, so far. Older kids, who may be scared but hide it, should be reassured that parents and health officials are on top of it. It's easy to freak out amid these disturbing reports, but the truth is you're probably doing everything you need to do to protect your family. ""Parents should be aware of what public health officials are saying, and then just be extra vigilant about the precautions they'd normally take to prevent the spread of germs,"" says Joseph Bocchini, M.D., chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases and pediatrics chair of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport. No. 1 on the list: washing hands more frequently. So take a deep breath, put down the surgical mask, and read on for all information you need to know. Parenting.com: Cold and flu old wives' tales . Signs and symptoms . Indicators of swine flu are not unlike those for regular old run-of-the-mill flu. What makes this virus different from typical flu is that more serious complications, such as pneumonia, might occur more often. Also, says Bocchini, this is a new strain of flu, and no one in the population would be expected to be immune. One of the biggest concerns for officials is simply that a lot of people could get sick at the same time. Take heart in knowing that our government health officials are doing everything they can to make sure the country's prepared. In the mean time, your job is to know how to spot the signs. If you or your child are experiencing any of the following, call your doctor. He or she may want you to come in and be tested. Parenting.com: Interactive symptom checker . • fever (above 100.4 for babies 3 months and younger, and 101.1 for everyone else), plus . • cough . • sore throat . • intense body aches . • headache . • chills . • fatigue . Some people have reported diarrhea and vomiting, too. Pregnant women are at extra risk for complications even with regular flu, according to Bocchini, and small children have a higher rate of hospitalization. Both expectant women and moms of kids under 2 should be extra careful about taking action quickly.  Parenting.com: How to keep nosy, germy strangers away from your baby . When to head to the ER . If your child demonstrates any of the following symptoms, it's time to seek emergency care: . • Fast or troubled breathing . • Bluish skin color . • Refusal to drink fluids . • Difficulty waking up and/or interacting . • Being so irritable that the child does not want to be held . * Flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough . • Fever with a rash, especially one that does not blanch . In adults, the following symptoms deserve an ER trip as well: . • Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath . • Pain or pressure in the chest . • Abdominal pain . • Sudden dizziness . • Confusion . • Severe or persistent vomiting . How to talk to your kids about It . As always, you'll want to explain to kids that germs can make us sick, and that's why it's important to wash your hands. You can say, ""Soap and water rinse away the little buggers so they can't make us feel bad."" If they've caught wind of swine flu in particular, it's important to project an image of calm (even if you're internally flipping out) and make them feel safe. Small kids should be soothed with a simple explanation that there are different kinds of flu, and we should just keep up with washing up. Older kids, who may be scared but hide it, can be given a few more details but should still be reassured that their parents and our health officials are on top of it. Easing symptoms and treatment . If you come down with the flu, swine or otherwise, there are a few things you can do to keep yourself comfortable. • If you or your child feel at all flu-ish, skip work and school. Stay home until you feel completely well. • Try to stay in a separate area of the house to limit the risk of passing the virus. • Rest up -- consider it your free pass to catch up on your DVR list. • Push clear fluids, such as water and soup. • Ease body aches with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. If your child is under 2, check with your doctor before giving them medication. • Using a humidifier can ease a stuffy nose. Saline drops followed by suctioning with a nasal syringe can bring additional relief to small children. • There is treatment for swine flu. Antiviral medications like Tamiflu and Relenza can lessen your symptoms make you feel better faster and prevent swine flu-related complications if taken early on. Consult your doctor about a prescription. Is there a cure? There's not a cure, but a vaccine is being developed, according to the FDA. If you already got a flu shot, it probably won't protect you from this strain, but it's a good idea to still get one annually. Prevention 101 . You probably already know all about how to prevent the spread of germs, but in an outbreak like this, it can't hurt to be a little more vigilant. Here's a rundown of easy things you can do, starting today. Parenting.com: Ask Dr. Sears: Immune system boosters . At home: . • This one's a no-brainer but bears repeating: wash your hands frequently, and make sure your kids do the same. It's a good idea to get into the habit of doing it as soon as you walk in the door, before meals and food prep, post-potty and after touching pets. • Take a moment to clean germ hot spots, like tables, doorknobs, desks and kitchen counters, with a disinfectant. Look for products that contain bleach or alcohol. • Keep your family's immune system strong with regular sleep, and lots of fruits and veggies. If you know anyone who's been sick, stay away for now. Out and about: . • Try to keep up the frequent hand-washing, especially after trips to the playground. • If you don't have a sink handy, use an alcohol-based sanitizer gel or wipe. Look for ones that contain at least 60% alcohol. • Try to avoid crowded areas. • Wash your hands or use sanitizer after handling money. • Use your own pen when signing credit card slips. Everywhere: . • Cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough or sneeze, and remind your kiddos to do the same. • Throw your used tissue in the trash instead of stuffing it in your pocket. • Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, which give germs a fast track to infection. • Remind kids not to share cups, utensils and plates with friends. Getting kids to wash their hands . Yes, you know they should wash those dirty mitts often, but what you really need to know is how to get them to do it sans whining. We've got some tips and tricks for making washing up fun: . • To get them to soap up for the required 20 seconds (or more), belt out ""Happy Birthday"" twice.

"(CNN) -- For Anthony Williams, being black in America means being a suspect. Anthony Williams says he feels like he's always a suspect to police. The 39-year-old former Marine said he's never had any trouble with the law, other than a few traffic violations, and leads a middle-class life in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. But the AT&T customer care representative said he still gets nervous when he hears that police are looking for a 6-foot-tall black man, ""because I know I fit that description.""

"(CNN) -- Dan Godshall and 21 other students at Slippery Rock University will not be allowed to graduate at their school's main ceremony because they recently visited Mexico. Dan Godshall was worried at first about telling his mother he wasn't able to be at the main graduation. The students, who returned this week after student teaching in Mexico, came back to the United States early because they were worried the border would be closed and they'd miss out on walking at their graduation. But now, they'll be walking in their own graduation, without any of their classmates, because the college feared they made have been exposed to the H1N1 flu outbreak in Mexico. ""At first I was like, no way, no way,"" Godshall told CNN. ""I had the irrational, 15-minute oh my God, oh my God, I can't go to my graduation."" The students got the news from the school and received an e-mail from the university's vice president explaining the change. ""The university has received hundreds of calls from students and parents who were worried about being exposed at the commencement ceremonies,"" the e-mail said. ""We have an obligation to protect others from what they perceive is possible exposure to this virus."" When he heard the news, Godshall was worried about how he would tell his mother that she wouldn't get to see him walk across the stage with the pomp and circumstance that everyone else will have. ""I thought my mom was going to freak,"" he said. iReport.com: How should we handle swine flu . Senior Ryan Brisini said at first when he found out that he couldn't walk, he was ""a little irked."" ""But we are a liability, and if you are going to try and do the best thing for the school and the entire graduation ceremony, we probably shouldn't be there,"" he said. So Brisini and Godshall took the news in stride. The 22 students will get a ceremony unlike anyone else in the school -- and the main graduation will see a video of their ceremony. ""It makes us a little distinguished from the group,"" Godshall said. ""We were already the Mexican group, the swine flu zombies, now it gives us something positive and everyone has to watch our ceremony."" And with a small ceremony, only attended by the 22 students, their family and friends and university officials, senior Ryan Brisini thinks it will be more memorable. He won't have to sit next to a bunch of people he won't know, and he won't have to endure the lingering theatrics of a regular ceremony. ""I think its kind of cool because when you are with people for an entire month you bond with them, and I can say I'm genuinely excited for everyone graduating, whereas at the main graduation I'd be with a bunch of kids I don't know,"" he said. ""With this I can clap and cheer for everyone and genuinely be happy for them."" Still, some students are upset they will miss out on the grandiose day. John Powell, who also went on the trip, told CNN affiliate WTAE-TV that the whole reason the group left early was so they could attend. ""It hits me a little bit. It's a necessary evil, separating us. I don't agree with it totally, but I'm not in too big of a position to overturn it,"" Powell said.  Watch Slippery Rock students tell their story » . WTAE reported the  university, in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, says it has received hundreds of calls from concerned people. ""There are concerns from the public perspective that they will be exposed,"" university spokeswoman Rita Abent told WTAE. ""They may boo them. They may get up and walk out. And graduation should be a very respectful and a very celebratory time."" Slippery Rock University isn't the only school making changes to graduation ceremonies because of swine flu fears. Cisco Junior College in West Central Texas is canceling Friday graduation ceremonies. Students will get their diplomas by mail, the college said. ""We understand that many will be disappointed by our decision,"" college President Colleen Smith said in a statement. ""However, we believe that it is more important to protect our students, employees and families than to proceed with graduation ceremonies at this time."" Graduates at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, will get diplomas at commencement ceremonies Saturday but will have to live without part of the day's tradition. ""Since direct contact is one of the ways flu viruses spread, we have decided to forgo the traditional congratulatory handshake as you come forward to receive your diploma and have your photo taken with your dean,"" the school told students in a letter posted on its Web site. Across the country thousands of elementary, middle and high school students are feeling the impact too. At least four high schools have canceled their proms this weekend, including Park City High School in Park City, Utah, according to CNN affiliate KSL-TV. Senior Kelly McGuire, who was getting ready for the prom on Saturday, is making last-minute changes because of the rescheduling. ""That's a bummer, because it means we have to try to cancel our limo,"" McGuire told KSL-TV. ""All cancellations have to be a week in advance. I have to cancel my tux, my corsage. It's going to be hectic."" The Department of Education said that as of noon on Friday 433 schools, with a total of 245,449 students, in 17 states have been closed. Fort Worth schools will be closed at least until May 12, authorities said, announcing that one student was confirmed to have swine flu. The closure affects about 80,000 students. Texas school officials have postponed all interscholastic sports until at least May 11. Alabama has taken a similar step, stopping competitions until at least Tuesday. In Montgomery County, Maryland, 1,250-student Rockville High School joined the closed list Friday when state health authorities closed it until further notice because of a suspected swine flu case. There, too, athletics were taking a big hit, Assistant Principal Dyan Gomez said. Rockville's teams were even banned from traveling to other schools to compete this weekend, she said.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's crown prince was convalescing Saturday in Morocco where he arrived this week after surgery for an undisclosed illness in New York City, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, right, seen in a 2007 file photo . Crown Prince Sultan, who is also the nation's deputy prime minister, completed ""all medical tests and treatments in the aftermath of the medical surgery he has previously undergone,"" the news agency said, quoting a statement from the Royal Court. Sultan arrived in the Moroccan city of Agadir on Wednesday, the press agency said. Speculation about his health has been mounting since he arrived in New York in February. While Saudi officials maintain publicly that Sultan's health has improved, the appointment in late March of a second deputy prime minister has raised more questions about the extent of his illness. Last month, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah issued a royal decree naming the interior minister, Prince Nayef -- the powerful brother of the crown prince and half-brother to the king -- to the post of second deputy prime minster. The appointment appears to mean Nayef is now the country's crown prince in waiting and second in line to be king. In recent weeks, local media have quoted Nayef as downplaying rumors that the crown prince may be seriously ill. ""I would like to assure you that the crown prince's health is very good,"" he told reporters in March, according to the English-language daily newspaper Arab News. ""God willing, after the medical vacation he will return to the kingdom in full health.""","Saudi Arabia's crown prince convalesces in Morocco after surgery in New York .

"(CNN) -- The wedding of a Boston, Massachusetts, medical student accused of killing a woman he met through Craigslist has been called off, his fiancee's lawyer said. The wedding of accused ""Craigslist killer"" Phillip Markoff and his fiancee, Megan McAllister, has been called off. Megan McAllister, who was accompanied by her mother, met Phillip Markoff for about 25 minutes in a Boston jail earlier this week, her lawyer Robert Honecker told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""It was an emotional conversation on both sides,"" Honecker said, adding that McAllister is planning to move back to her home state of New Jersey. ""There is still a love and commitment to that person, and I think that obviously realizing what has now happened, that she has to take steps to do what she has to do on her life,"" Honecker told WCVB. She plans to move on, he said. ""There are things that she has to do, and I think the process begins today,"" Honecker told WCVB. Honecker told ABC on Thursday that the wedding ""will not occur.""

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A killer bug is spreading like wildfire. Armed guards stand outside the Mexico City Respiratory Hospital to control the flow of people. Streets of one of the world's biggest cities are eerily empty. Bars and restaurants have been shuttered for days. The president goes on TV to tell workers to stay at home for their own safety. Those who venture outside are clad in surgical masks. Once healthy people are suddenly falling sick and dying from a new disease, H1N1 swine flu. The government swears the situation is under control. But down at the hospital, medics scurry around behind the glass door of an isolation ward. They're clad from head to toe in biohazard suits, goggles and two pairs of gloves. At the airport, officials set up a barrage of thermal imaging machines. If the picture flashes up red or orange, would-be passengers are whisked off to medical facilities.  See where the virus has been confirmed » . It may sound like a sci-fi movie. It's not. Welcome to Mexico City. It's a nightmare scenario and despite twice-a-day news conferences featuring Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova, people on the streets fear the virus may be out of control and that the real death toll may be greater than anyone is letting on.  Watch how the city has been shut down » . ""The measures we're taking are working and are helping us to slow the spread of the virus. But the situation continues to be serious,"" Cordova said at a news conference this week. Government orders to its citizens are clear: wash frequently, don't shake hands or kiss, and stay away from crowded places. That's easier said than done. The doors on the subway car snap open at Hidalgo station. Dozens more passengers clad in surgical masks stream on. It's rush hour deep below the streets of downtown Mexico City. The subway system is the veins of the capital, ferrying millions of people from all social classes to and from work. It's hot and humid down there and there's little fresh air. It's just the kind of crowded place that Mexican authorities say could be a prime breeding ground for swine flu. ""I'm pretty nervous of this whole virus thing,"" welder Frontino Valdez mumbled  through one of the masks.  Watch passengers packed onto trains trying to protect themselves » . Sitting one carriage down, Berta Hernandez, a product demonstrator, tries not to show her panic and applies eyeliner like any other morning. But today she has a problem, she has no intention of lifting her mask to paint on lip gloss. ""I'm nervous of those people who aren't wearing masks. Maybe they will suddenly sneeze or cough,"" she said. In these days of swine flu paranoia, just coughing, or worse sneezing, in the subway, or ""metro"" as they call it here, brings black looks from fellow passengers. This has been a strange epidemic since the outset. So far, the Mexican government has been unable to pinpoint where or when this outbreak started. Authorities admit there was an outbreak of influenza in a village in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz in early April. But only one patient -- 5-year-old Edgar Hernandez -- was diagnosed as having swine flu.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta ask the boy about his symptoms » . The international media have taken to calling him ""Patient Zero."" He made a full recovery. So far there's no evidence a pig farm near his home reported any problems with its livestock. The family hasn't explained how little Edgar could have infected a capital city let alone the world. The authorities haven't drawn up a genetic map of Edgar's illness nor compared it to the lethal strain that swept through Mexico City and other parts of the country. Lethal it is. But getting to the truth of who has really died from the virus is tough. Since midweek, the government abandoned its initial reporting and began to speak only of confirmed swine flu cases and confirmed deaths due to the H1N1 virus. Previously it had also tallied suspected cases and others under observation. In practice, it is taking days for the government to get test results from autopsies and tests. By the time a case is confirmed the patient may be long buried. One afternoon this week, at a cinder block home perched on a hillside in a poor northern neighborhood of Mexico City, a coffin was mounted on the living room table. A steady stream of neighbors filed in to pay their final tribute to a dead 24-year-old. Biting back tears, a young man said his brother had died of ""respiratory problems."" When asked what kind of a person his brother was, he said simply: ""He was an honest man. He never got in any trouble."" The man seemed to be feeling an underlying sense of shame. Suddenly there was a huge stigma attached to swine flu -- like in the early days of AIDS-related deaths -- and Mexican families were keen to dispel notions their loved ones had died of the mutant virus. They didn't want the prying eyes of the media near their home. We wanted to tell their story, observe the wake and follow the funeral. But death is a rite of passage. They had a right to mourn in private. The following day came a tip-off that a 5-year-old girl, Maria Fernanda Garcia, had died. The modest side street outside her home in eastern Mexico City was swarming with police, health workers and civil protection officials.  Watch how armed guards were part of Maria Fernanda's funeral » . Little Maria Fernanda's father appeared briefly and told us we weren't welcome. He was curt when he told us his daughter had died from pneumonia. A medic confirmed the specific cause of death was indeed pneumonia. But he added the hospital was still waiting for test results to confirm whether the underlying cause was swine flu. He conceded that process could take days. But judging by the heavy security, local authorities certainly feared this was another case of the virus. ""These are the prevention measures we must take. This case is still not confirmed but we must take these steps to protect citizens,"" said Victor Luna, a member of the public security detail for this district of Mexico City. A few minutes later, the hearse with Maria Fernanda's body pulled out of the housing complex where she lived. Her dad was clutching a Winnie Pooh cuddly toy as he rode up front. Police and health officials shadowed the funeral cortege to the graveyard. Police guards only permitted immediate family and close friends through the iron gates. Through the bars silent, tearful mourners could be seen weaving through a labyrinth of headstones. Later that afternoon, the family had left Maria Fernanda's grave -- a tiny patch of newly dug dry earth, not much more than 3 feet long. It was covered with sweet-scented white flowers. The plaque on the grave was a simple hand-painted affair: . ""Maria Fernanda. 2004 to 2009. We love you.""","Every aspect of life has been hit by the spread of H1N1 in Mexico City .

"(CNN) -- The number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus has jumped nearly 30 percent with 331 people being infected so far, the World Health Organization said Friday. A young couple in Mexico City wear surgical masks in an attempt to avoid contamination from the virus. The WHO added that the virus had spread to 11 countries, but the hardest hit areas were in the western hemisphere. ""We have not seen sustained human to human transmission anywhere outside the Americas region,"" said WHO spokesman Thomas Abraham. Two more countries, Denmark and China, reported cases of the 2009 H1N1 ""swine flu"" virus on Friday, but they were still to be confirmed by the WHO. The largest outbreak was in Mexico which had 156 confirmed cases, while there were 141 cases confirmed and one death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The WHO said Mexico had 9 deaths attributed to the virus. But Mexican officials said the death toll had risen to 12. However, more than 150 deaths in Mexico are suspected to have been caused by the virus and are being investigated, officials there said. The higher totals do not necessarily mean that incidence of the disease is increasing, but rather that health investigators are going through their backlog of specimens, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of WHO. In addition to Mexico and the United States, the following countries have so far confirmed non-lethal cases: . Austria: 1  Canada: 34  China: 1 Denmark: 1 Germany: 3 Israel: 2  Netherlands: 1  New Zealand: 3  Spain: 13  Switzerland: 1  United Kingdom: 9 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Sportsmen and women being caught taking drugs is not a new phenomenon -- but it's still a shock when the news breaks. Romania's Adrian Mutu was sacked by Chelsea and banned from the game for testing positive for cocaine. Only recently Michael Phelps, who shattered Olympic records by claiming eight golds in the pool in Beijing last year, was caught on camera with a marijuana pipe to his mouth. The American is far from alone. The history of sport is peppered with drug use, usually of the performance-enhancing kind: athletics has been blighted by it, cycling has lost much of its credibility because of it and baseball has proven to be far from immune. But football, the world's most popular game in terms of fan following and participation, does not seem to have had its share of drugs scandals, not least in the world's most high profile division, the English Premier League. No top-flight player in English football has ever tested positive for using performance-enhancing drugs in a league match. The closest anyone has come is Middlesbrough FC defender Abel Xavier, who was banned from football by UEFA for 18 months in 2005 when he tested positive for the steroid dianabol after a UEFA Cup match. The English Football Association (FA) takes its lead on doping from UK Sport, the body which regulates drug testing in the UK based on the code set out by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Let us know your views of drugs and drug testing in football. UK Sport's Russell Langley does not believe more tests would necessarily return more positive results. ""It's a difficult question to answer,"" he said. ""The stats show what they show. But it's fair to say if doping was going on at that level we would have unearthed it. ""Our focus at UK Sport is not on more and more testing -- we don't think that's going to answer the question about whether there's more doping out there. ""What we want to do is make every test we do as effective as possible. If there are people out there doping we've got to have the right level of intelligence and information to target them. ""Testing at no notice and out of competition is where we think we've got the best chance of being able to catch any sportsmen taking drugs,"" he added. English footballers can be tested after matches (in competition) and at training sessions (out of competition). Until a few years ago, a tester was forbidden from turning up at a footballer's house unannounced (no notice). But the FA has altered its stance as part of its claim that it ""maintains the largest and most comprehensive out-of-competition testing program in international football."" They conduct 1,600 random, no-notice drug tests per season, which the World Anti-Doping Code and the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping on Sport state is the most effective method of combating the use of drugs in sport. But those 1,600 tests are conducted on professional players, non-league football, women's football and youth team football. It means the chances are small of catching any Premier League star who may be using drugs. Down the years, Italy's Serie A has seen the most cases of players getting caught with either performance-enhancing or recreational drugs in their system. One reason for this is the Italian authorities' no-nonsense stance: two players from each squad are drawn at random to be tested after every match. And it has worked. Household names such as Jaap Stam, Edgar Davids, Pep Guardiola, Fernando Couto, Francesco Flachi, Mohamed Kallon and Diego Maradona have all been caught in the last two decades. By way of comparison, Billy Turley, a goalkeeper in one of England's lower leagues, was let off with warning after being found to have taken the steroid nandrolone in the 2002-03 season. It took a further positive test for cocaine for him to get a six-month ban. But on the issue of combating social drugs -- something not demanded by WADA's code -- Langley believes the FA's stance is to be applauded. He said: ""They invest heavily in their testing program. They recognize that a particular problem for their sport is social drugs so this separate testing goes on. They don't have to do it. ""This carries a different set of sanctions which are controlled by the FA and the aim of that program is about rehabilitation rather than punishment."" Langley said the sanctions send out a strong message that the FA is prepared to do something about it. ""They recognize their responsibility -- football is a huge role model for youngsters,"" he added. Chris Armstrong, then of Crystal Palace, became the first Premier League player to fail a drug test when he tested positive for cannabis in 1995. He was back playing within a month following a brief spell in rehab. Chelsea's Mark Bosnich and Adrian Mutu have both been caught with cocaine in their systems and both were banned and sacked by the club in the 2000s. The FA also wants to make sure that players understand that not taking a test is not an option either, making an example of Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand. The center-back missed a scheduled drugs test in 2003 and was belatedly suspended for eight months and fined £50,000. Ferdinand could have got a bigger punishment. The FA's guidelines state that for a first offence a minimum suspension of three months up to a maximum of two years will apply, but a lack of consistency has always dogged punishments for drug offences. No other footballer has been reported as missing a test since. The FA is far from blind to the issue of drugs in English football and since the Ferdinand incident their policies and punishments have been tightened. But as long as a player's chances of getting caught remain comparatively small, drugs in football appears to be an issue the FA is keeping a lid on rather than eradicating.","Football has seen a number of high-profile players fail drugs tests .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Watching the news out of Mexico is causing a case of déjà vu for Dr. Lo Wing-Luk. The sight of people wearing masks became common in Hong Kong after the SARS outbreak of 2003. ""Seeing the people in masks today reminds me of Hong Kong during SARS,"" said Lo, an epidemiology expert who was among those on the frontline during the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong in 2003, which within three months infected 8,000 and killed nearly 800 in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Toronto. Historically, Hong Kong has been center stage for recent infections that threatened to spiral across the world, such as SARS and Avian Influenza, which first struck and killed people here in 1997. Southern China -- with the close proximity of its rural agriculture to population centers and globally connected transportation -- has been an ideal conduit for past animal diseases that spread to humans and then to the rest of the world. But with the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico and the United States, Hong Kong suddenly finds the world looking to it for lessons on how to stop the spread of disease. ""Managing a (potential) pandemic can't be from the top down, it must be from the ground up,"" said Lo, a former Hong Kong legislator representing the medical community. In the early days of SARS, cooperation was lax between Hong Kong health officials and public officials across the border in mainland China, where the live animal wet markets in Guangdong province is suspected in the virus' jump to humans. ""One of the most important lesson of SARS was the importance of good communication,"" says Dr. KY Yuen, head of the microbiology department of Hong Kong University, which found the first human cases of Avian Influenza in 1997 and first identified SARS in 2003. ""There were outbreaks in the middle to late November in Guangdong Province, but the first cases were reported in Hong Kong three months later,"" he said. ""We could have reduced the impact (of SARS) if there had been better communication"" between Hong Kong and mainland China health authorities. The communication channels have improved between China and Hong Kong, health officials said, as well as better surveillance of the disease. Every visitor who comes through Hong Kong International Airport now is scanned by infrared monitors and immediately isolated if suffering from a fever or respiratory illness. ""Quarantine and isolation of people (suspected to be ill) is crucial now,"" Yuen said. As the disease spreads, there is a conflict between the need for a quick response and the time required for appropriate scientific study -- which can result in some bad decisions, Yuen said. For example, in the case of SARS health experts wore full-body protection suits because of initial hunches the disease was being spread by airborne causes. More people were exposed to the disease because of the harried medical staff's improper use of the cumbersome equipment. ""It turned out globes, masks and hand washing were far more effective"" than a breathing apparatus, Yuen said. ""Presumptions are dangerous,"" he added. If Hong Kong is any example, governments who fail to meet the challenges of an outbreak will face rising public heat. In July 2003, half a million Hong Kong residents took to the streets to protest the government, in part because of frustrations over the response to the SARS outbreak, says Cecilia Chan, director of the Center of Behavioral Health at Hong Kong University -- adding to the woes of the already beleaguered administration of former Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Wah, who later stepped down in the middle of his second five-year appointment.","Hong Kong at center of recent infections that threatened to spiral across world .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A Pakistani man using ""colonel"" as a title is one of about three dozen people wanted over November's terrorist attacks in Mumbai, but his connections with the Pakistani army have not been established, Indian prosecutors say. Police patrol in New Delhi last year following warnings of possible attacks using hijacked aircraft, officials said. ""This is all a matter of investigation,"" special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam told CNN Thursday when asked if India thought he had links to the Pakistani army. Neither is it clear whether the ""colonel"" belonged to the Pakistan-based militant outfit Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which is blamed for the Mumbai siege, Nikam said. But India, the public prosecutor added, had ""ample evidence"" of his involvement in the November attacks. Authorities say Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving suspect accused of taking part in the Mumbai siege, faces a multitude of charges, including murder and attempted murder. Speaking outside Qila Court in Mumbai, Nikam said Kasab didn't attend the hearing for security reasons. The next hearing is set for March 9. A 21-year-old Pakistani, Kasab was one of 10 men accused of participating in the coordinated sieges on buildings such as the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, Mumbai's historic Victoria Terminus train station and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. Indian forces killed nine suspects. More than 160 people, including many foreigners, died during the three days of attacks that began November 26. Authorities said Kasab was trained by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after a terrorist attack on India's parliament. The group denied responsibility. Nikam said on Wednesday that the 50-page document describing the charges against Kasab also contains the names of 35 other suspects being sought in the crimes, many of whom are thought to be members of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. The prosecutor said his office hopes to finish the trial for Kasab in three to six months. He has been in police custody since November 28. Also charged Wednesday were two men accused of helping to plan the violence, Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed, according to the prosecutor.","Pakistani man using ""colonel"" as a title is wanted over Mumbai attacks .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Terror attacks have spiked dramatically in Afghanistan and Pakistan as extremists in both countries strengthen their power and expand operations, according to a State Department report released Thursday. The number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan, like this bombing in April, has more than quadrupled from 2006 to 2008. But the State Department annual terrorism report notes an overall decline in attacks worldwide and fewer attacks in Iraq. The attacks worldwide have decreased by 20 percent, with 30 percent fewer fatalities, said Russell Travers of the National Counterterrorism Center. The report says al Qaeda and its extremist supporters have moved across the Afghan border ""to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier, where they have used this terrain as a safe haven to hide, train terrorists, communicate with the followers, plot attacks and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan."" In Pakistan alone, the report says, attacks more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2008, with a sharp increase in their ""coordination, sophistication and frequency."" Last year there were 1,839 terrorist ""incidents,"" compared with 890 in 2007, Travers said. The rise in violence has complicated the Obama administration's effort to implement its strategy of boosting military and civilian programs in both countries. The report says the largest number of attacks occurred in Pakistani provinces near the Afghan border, including Balochistan, the North West Frontier and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where extremists have sought to challenge the government and extend Islamic law. It also notes the government's inability to get a handle on the extremists. Despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces, it says, ""the government of Pakistan's authority in the area continued to be challenged."" Ronald Schlicher, the State Department's acting coordinator of counterterrorism, told reporters the Obama administration has ""real concerns"" that al Qaeda's senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the United States. ""We have a real sense that it's happening, but we have imperfect knowledge of what they're doing,"" he said. Pakistan's military in the past week launched an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of an agreement signed this year by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The deal, criticized by the United States, allowed the Taliban to implement Islamic law, or sharia, in the region in exchange for an end to fighting. The recent operations are part of the Pakistani army's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan. The strikes have rankled relations between the two countries. Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters, communication equipment and night-vision technology as part of a U.S. plan to beef up the country's counterterrorism efforts. President Obama told reporters Wednesday night that he is ""gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan."" Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office, Obama said the United States has ""huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable"" and doesn't end up a ""nuclear-armed militant state."" After making two visits to Pakistan in less than three weeks, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, is ""very alarmed by the growing extremist threat in Pakistan and remains frustrated particularly by the political leaderships' inability to confront that threat,"" according to his chief spokesman. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have called Taliban gains in Pakistan an ""existential threat"" to the country. The State Department report notes the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, in November, attributing them to the Pakistan-based Kashmir terrorist group Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and to its fundraising subsidiary, amaat ud-Dawa. Although Pakistan has cracked down on some of the groups' camps and made several arrests, the report warned of continuing tension between India and Pakistan. The report says Afghanistan is plagued by ""an insurgency that more and more relied on vicious and increasingly sophisticated terrorist attacks,"" despite the efforts of NATO forces and the Afghan government. ""The anti-government insurgency remained a capable, determined and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority,"" the report warns. Although the Taliban continued to suffer heavy combat loses, the report says its ability to leverage support from al Qaeda and recruit soldiers ""remained undiminished."" ""Taliban information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated,"" it says. ""Streams of Taliban financing from across the border in Pakistan, along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking, have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities."" Iran is also a source of training to the Taliban ""on small-unit tactics, small arms, explosives and indirect-fire weapons,"" the report says. ""Since at least 2006, Iran has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members,"" it says. While terrorists in Iraq still launched attacks last year, ""there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country, including a decrease in civilian casualties, enemy attacks, and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year,"" the report says. There were 3,258 terrorist incidents in 2008, down almost half from the 6,210 attacks in 2007, Travers said. He added there was a decrease during the first quarter of 2009, although there has a been a spike in terrorist attacks in April. Although the threat from al Qaeda in Iraq ""continued to diminish"" due to significant defections and a loss of both territory and funding, al Qaeda continued to benefit from safe haven in Somalia and has strengthened its North African operations, the report says. It notes a sharp increase in attacks by al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa. In Algeria, many of the attacks were blamed on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, whose tactics ""appeared to be influenced by [al Qaeda's] experience in Iraq."" The report also warns ""the security situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate during 2008 and was marked by a series of attacks against both Western and Yemeni interests,"" culminating in the September 17 suicide bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa that killed 18. ""Recruitment for al Qaeda in Yemen (AQY) remained strong, and the use of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) and suicide vests indicated a high level of training, coordination, and sophistication by Yemen's terrorist leadership,"" the report says. The report calls the government's response to the terrorist threat ""intermittent and its ability to pursue and prosecute suspected terrorists remained weak due to a number of shortcomings, including stalled draft counterterrorism legislation."" Although a raid in August on an al Qaeda in Yemen cell in the country uncovered large number of weapons, the report warns the action ""did little to deter or disrupt other AQY cells."" It was a month later that at least seven assailants dressed in Yemeni security-service uniforms attacked the U.S. Embassy with explosives and suicide vests, launching what the report calls a ""sophisticated and well-coordinated"" attack. The report says Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism,"" including supporting terrorist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, all of which opposed the Middle East peace process, as well as Iraq-based militants and the Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. It cites the Qods Force, an elite branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as the regime's ""primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad."" ""Iran's involvement in the planning and financial support of terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia had a direct impact on international efforts to promote peace, threatened economic stability in the Gulf, and undermined the growth of democracy,"" the report says. Schlicher also said that the United States is ""troubled by indications that the Iranians may be seeking to extend their influence into other parts of the world and expand its military ties into Latin America."" The Obama administration has adopted a policy of engagement with Iran in an effort to curb its nuclear ambitions.","Attacks in Pakistan have more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2008, report says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In a bustling room full of computers, giant wall-mounted monitors and constantly ringing telephones, a newly gathered army is fighting a war. The swine flu outbreak has kept workers busy at the Emergency Operations Center at the CDC.. The control room is staffed 24/7, and the leader recently had to tell his fighters to make sure to take a day off per week. This is the Emergency Operations Center at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has ramped up its resources to tackle swine flu, a new disease that experts say may evolve into a global pandemic. ""The last time when we were really at this level was Hurricane Katrina,"" said Toby Crafton, operations manager. The CDC has 400 people tasked to work on the virus, also called the 2009 H1N1 flu, Crafton said. The agency had deployed 50 people to various U.S. states and Mexico by Friday. The Mexican government asked the CDC to help facilitate laboratory testing of the virus during a conference call with Canada and the United States, he said.  Watch as Dr. Sanjay Gupta tours the Emergency Operations Center » . ""We don't go anywhere unilaterally. We don't go into any state unless asked,"" Crafton said. ""So if the state health department or the state health director or the government feels like their capacity is exceeded or they need us for our scientific expertise, they will ask us to come.""  Explainer: What you should know about 2009 H1N1 flu » . The U.S. has also committed to giving Mexico 400,000 doses of the antiviral drug Tamiflu, a shipment believed to have arrived Friday morning, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director for science and public health at the CDC. In front of each computer in the Emergency Operations Center is a placard: Ethics, Immunization, Mental Health, Security, and dozens more. The people -- some in jeans, some in skirts, some in uniforms with military stripes -- are fielding phones calls to their respective departments. Elsewhere in laboratories, samples of the virus arrive in FedEx and World Courier packages for analysis, triple packaged to avoid leaking. Scientists are working on the genetic sequencing of the virus, as well as growing a strain that functions as a vaccine. Although the CDC is not in the business of mass-producing vaccines, researchers there are working on developing one. A vaccine strain is being grown and characterized, Schuchat said. Once a suitable candidate virus is developed -- it takes about three weeks -- the CDC theoretically would send it to a manufacturer, which would need another eight to 10 weeks to determine production possibilities as well as the dosage, said Dr. Nancy Cox, director of the CDC's Influenza Division, at a press conference Friday. But it would not interfere with the seasonal influenza vaccine. ""If a vaccine for this new virus is prepared, it would be prepared either in parallel with or after the seasonal vaccine is already produced,"" Cox said. Still, there has not been a recommendation to mass produce a vaccine for swine flu. The U.S. part of that decision would come from the Department of Health and Human Services.  Map: Where the flu is » . Researchers are still struggling to understand the origin of the virus. ""What isn't making sense right now is why there weren't reports of illness in pigs,"" said Michael Shaw, leader of the laboratory team force for the 2009 H1N1 virus. ""Usually, if you find a human who has been infected by a swine influenza virus, you look around, you start seeing sick pigs, and we haven't seen that.""  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta talk with Michael Shaw about what CDC is doing to combat virus » . It is possible that the virus did not originate in pigs. Swine viruses have been found in turkeys, for example, Shaw said. The 2009 H1N1 virus has a ""level 2"" containment distinction at the CDC, although extra precautions from ""level 3"" are being applied, Shaw said. That means swine flu is one containment level below avian flu, which was at 3. One key handling difference is that lab workers had to shower after being exposed to the avian virus, he said. Back in the Emergency Operations Center, computer screens glow with e-mails, maps, databases, slides and articles related to the new flu strain. ""We're going to continue to be vigilant and continue to work as hard as we can until it's over,"" Crafton said.","CDC has 400 people tasked to track and fight the 2009 H1N1 flu virus .

"(CNN) -- New Hampshire's Senate has approved a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry, but critics and supporters of the legislation say their work isn't over. New Hampshire could become the fifth state to allow same-sex marriage if a bill becomes law. ""We were obviously disappointed,"" Kevin Smith, executive director of the conservative Cornerstone Policy Research Action group, said Thursday. ""We don't think the voters are going to forget about it."" On the other side, members of the New Hampshire Freedom to Marry Coalition, a group that has worked since 2001 for same-sex marriage, were ""absolutely thrilled,"" said Mo Baxley, its executive director. But noting that the bill is returning to the House of Representatives for consideration of changes made by the Senate, Baxley added, ""I think the work continues."" Her organization will encourage supporters to contact their representatives ahead of the House vote, she said. On Wednesday, the Senate voted 13-11 in favor of the bill, which differs from the House-approved version in that it distinguishes between civil and religious marriage. It allows each religion to decide whether to acknowledge same-sex marriage but extends the option of civil marriage to any two individuals, said state Senate spokeswoman Anne Saunders. The House, which passed the earlier version last month by a margin of seven votes, 186-179, must approve the changed version before it can be sent to Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat who has questioned the need for the bill. After the Senate vote, Lynch released a statement saying he believes that ""the fundamental issue is about providing the same rights and protections to same-sex couples as are available to heterosexual couples. This was accomplished through the passage of the civil unions law two years ago."" Lynch signed the state's civil unions law in May 2007. ""To achieve further real progress,"" he added, ""the federal government would need to take action to recognize New Hampshire civil unions."" Earlier this month, the governor said he believes the word ""marriage"" should be used only to describe a marriage between a man and a woman, the New Hampshire Union Leader in Manchester reported. ""I think the word 'marriage' is reserved for a marriage between a man and a woman, and I think the real issues really are rights and protections for gay and lesbian couples,"" he told reporters on April 15, according to the newspaper. Smith said his organization, which was established in 2000, would ""lobby hard"" to get the governor to veto the bill. He said he expected it to pass the House. ""Look, this is a matter of holding the governor accountable,"" he said. ""He's been very public with his views on same-sex marriage in the state. ... We'll see if he was misleading the voters of New Hampshire or if he'll stand by his word and actually veto it."" Were the bill to become law, New Hampshire would become the fifth state allowing same-sex marriage, joining Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts and Iowa. Only Vermont has established the practice legislatively. CNN's Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.","Same-sex marriage bill returns to New Hampshire House after Senate approval .

"(CNN) -- Deep underground on the border between France and Switzerland, the world's largest particle accelerator complex will explore the world on smaller scales than any human invention has explored before. The collider's ALICE experiment will look at how the universe formed by analyzing particle collisions. The Large Hadron Collider will look at how the universe formed by analyzing particle collisions. Some have expressed fears that the project could lead to the Earth's demise -- something scientists say will not happen. Still, skeptics have filed suit to try to stop the project.   It even has a rap dedicated to it on YouTube. Scientists say the collider is finally ready for an attempt to circulate a beam of protons the whole way around the 17-mile tunnel. The test, which takes place Wednesday, is a major step toward seeing if the the immense experiment will provide new information about the way the universe works. ""It's really a generation that we've been looking forward to this moment, and the moments that will come after it in particular,"" said Bob Cousins, deputy to the scientific leader of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment, one of six experiments inside the collider complex. ""September 10 is a demarcation between finishing the construction and starting to turn it on, but the excitement will only continue to grow."" The collider consists of a particle accelerator buried more than 300 feet near Geneva, Switzerland. About $10 billion have gone into the accelerator's construction, the particle detectors and the computers, said Katie Yurkewicz, spokewoman for CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which is host to the collider. In the coming months, the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions. It will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year, and the experiments could generate enough data to make a discovery by 2009, experts say. Check out the collider complex's six detectors » . Testing the unknown . Experts say the collider has the potential to confirm theories about questions that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions. They also hope to find a theoretical particle called the Higgs boson, which has never been detected, but would help explain why matter has mass. The collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, when there was a hot ""soup"" of tiny particles called quarks and gluons, to look at how the universe evolved, said John Harris, U.S. coordinator for ALICE, a detector specialized to analyze that question. Since this is exploratory science, the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories, but which are just as interesting, said Joseph Lykken, theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. ""When Columbus sails west, he thought he was going to find something. He didn't find what he thought he was going to find, but he did find something interesting,"" said Lykken, who works on the Compact Muon Solenoid, one of six experiments inside the collider complex. Why should the layperson care about this particular exploration? Years ago, when electrons were first identified, no one knew what they were good for, but they have since transformed our entire economy, said Howard Gordon, deputy research program manager for the collider's ATLAS experiment. ""The transformative effect of this research will be to understand the world we live in much better,"" said Gordon, at Brookhaven National Laboratory. ""It's important for just who we are, what we are."" Black hole fears are ""baloney"" Fears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them -- including the whole Earth. Such fears prompted legal actions in the U.S. and Europe to halt the operation of the Large Hadron Collider, alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge. Although physicists acknowledge that the collider could, in theory, create small black holes, they say they do not pose any risk. A study released Friday by CERN scientists explains that any black hole created would be tiny, and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving. Five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told CNN there would be no danger from potential black holes. John Huth, who works on the collider's ATLAS experiment, called such fears ""baloney"" in a recent interview, and noted that in normal physics, even if the black hole were stable, it could just pass through the Earth without being detected or without interacting at all. ""The gravitational force is so weak that you'd have to wait many, many, many, many, many lifetimes of the universe before one of these things could [get] big enough to even get close to being a problem,"" said Huth, professor of physics at Harvard University. At the scene . When visiting the general-purpose detectors CMS and ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider, Lykken said he was awed that 30,000 tons of electronics would have to work without anyone fiddling with them all the time. ""It just blows you away to look at these things and realize they're not only incredibly complex and huge, but they have to actually work,"" he said. ""They have to work without people banging on them all day because they're sitting underground all by themselves."" With twice as much iron as the Eiffel Tower, CMS will run at full power for the first time in conjunction with the first beam test Wednesday, Lykken said. The magnet serves to bend particles, whizzing by at almost the speed of light, to figure out what kind of particles they are. Although the detector's parts weigh thousands of tons, in previous trials of CMS at lower power, the magnet actually yanked certain parts around because of its power, Lykken said. ""You're talking about such incredible power inside both the accelerator and detectors that you never really know until you turn it all on what's going to happen,"" he said. Scientists around the world are pumped for the first beam. Fermilab, the high energy physics lab in Batavia, Illinois, and major collaborator on the Large Hadron Collider, will be host of a ""pajama party"" at 1:30 a.m. CT that includes a live connection to CERN to follow the action. Cousins believes that because the collider pushes the frontiers of science and technology, it would be ""amazingly impressive if it works the first try,"" he said in a phone interview from CERN. Any little disturbance of the magnetic field anywhere in the tunnel could stop the beam from making it all the way around. Still, after a 25-year wait, he's not complaining. ""I personally will be fine if there's some problem that has to be overcome in the next few days,"" he said.","Large Hadron Collider will have first attempt at circulating a beam September 10 .

"(CNN) -- Hamburg have put one foot in the UEFA Cup final after a header from Germany winger Piotr Trochowski proved enough to give them a 1-0 win at Bundesliga rivals Werder Bremen in the first leg of their semifinal. Piotr Trochowski celebrates the only goal as Hamburg took a major step towards the UEFA Cup final. Martin Jol's side scored the only goal of a pulsating match in the 38th minute when Trochowski, the smallest player on the pitch, rose superbly at the back post to head Guy Demel's right-wing cross past goalkeeper Tim Wiese. Both side had countless half-chances to score but Hamburg wasted the best of them on the hour mark when Bayern Munich-bound striker Ivica Olic broke through in acres of space, but fired his shot straight at Wiese. Hamburg's victory puts them on line for their first European final since 1983, when they beat Juventus 1-0 to win the European Cup. This was the second of four matches in quick succession between the north Germany neighbors -- who met each other in the German Cup last week and will play the return leg of the semifinal next Thursday before a Bundesliga clash on Sunday May 10. And the result was sweet revenge for Hamburg, who saw Wiese save three penalties in last week's shoot-out as Werder knocked their rivals out of the German Cup, also at the semifinal stage. The eventual winners will play either Shakhtar Donetsk or Dynamo Kiev in May's Istanbul final.","Hamburg in line for first European final since 1983 after defeating Werder 1-0 .

"SPRUCE PINE, North Carolina (CNN) -- Like most parents, Vickie and Keith Murdock worry about providing for their family. With three teenage daughters, that can be a big challenge, but these days it's more difficult than ever. Keith and Vickie Murdock retrained for new jobs after suffering layoffs. But they remain unemployed. Vickie and Keith are both out of work. They live in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, a tiny mountain town about an hour's drive northeast of Asheville that has lost more than 2,000 jobs since 2003. That's a devastating number, given that Mitchell County's 2000 Census population was only 15,687. Keith was laid off in 2001, when a textile mill closed. He had worked there for 13 years. He did what all the experts say to do: He went back to school, got his GED and retrained to be an auto body mechanic. After graduation, he found a job at nearby Altec Industries. But again, he was laid off in January. Today, he spends his time looking for work. Keith said ""everybody you talk to"" tells him, "" 'well, we're not hiring. We ain't got nothing open right now.' "" Vickie has suffered her own layoff. She lost her job in 2006 when furniture maker Ethan Allen closed its plant in the area. She decided to retrain and will graduate from the local community college in May as a certified medical assistant. Vickie hopes to get a job at a local clinic, but jobs are hard to come by in this area. Major industries, including textile manufacturing, furniture making and mining, have downsized or left the area completely. The Rev. Bill Sweetser works with Shepherd's Staff, a local food pantry. He says workers there are seeing three times as many clients as they did just last year.  Watch how the Murdocks have struggled against the bad economy » . The food bank is in an old textile mill that just a few years ago was one of the largest employers in Mitchell County. Now, former workers come there for assistance. ""Right now, I would say we're barely keeping up,"" Sweetser said. ""Our policy is that everybody who comes in will get something. Sometimes we're out of certain staples. ... It may not be the food you want to give them, it may not be the food they necessarily prefer, but we give them something."" Community leaders are hoping a focus on promoting mountain crafts and tourism and a growing second home market will spur an economic revitalization. Keith Holtsclaw runs Blue Ridge Regional Hospital, one of the area's largest employers, and heads the county's economic development commission. ""I just don't see manufacturing coming back into the community,"" he said. ""We have to work with what we've got. We have lots of artists here. We are great, we're on the Blue Ridge Parkway, we're on the Appalachian Trail ... so we need to play to our strengths."" Until that economic revitalization happens, Vickie and Keith Murdock are living off unemployment benefits and hoping to find work soon. Vickie tries to calm her anxiety about the everyday costs of life. ""We think that when we get to worrying how we are gonna pay for this,"" she said, ""it's like the Lord makes a way.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York's iconic Plaza Hotel will lose a figure nearly as synonymous with it as Eloise when its longest-serving doorman retires Thursday after 46 years on the job. Ed Trinka, whose retirement coincides with his 65th birthday, joined the hotel 1963. Ed Trinka, whose retirement coincides with his 65th birthday, joined the hotel's staff in 1963 as a teenager. He spent 40 years at the fabled lodging's Fifth Avenue entrance, relocating to its doorway facing Central Park South during the property's renovation and partial conversion to condominiums several years ago. Now as much a Central Park South fixture as the horse-drawn carriages that line the park's southern perimeter, the gregarious Trinka is known as the ""mayor of 59th Street."" On a recent afternoon, he seemed to know every other passerby, exchanging a constant stream of hellos with chauffeurs and doormen from adjacent tony apartment buildings and, of course, the Plaza's residents. Over his more than four decades manning the Plaza's entrance, Trinka has met countless celebrities -- or ""all of them,"" as he puts it. After his first celebrity encounter at the hotel with the Beatles, he's catered to a long procession of big names, including Joe DiMaggio, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Liza Minnelli. Marla Maples, ex-wife of one-time Plaza owner Donald Trump, would regularly peck Trinka on the cheek when she saw him. Trinka says he has an autographed photo of Richard Nixon -- a token of gratitude from the former president -- hanging on proud display at his home. Trinka says he has thoroughly enjoyed his lengthy stay at the portal to history and glamour. ""I never had a bad day in all the years."" Nonetheless, with all those years at the hotel under his belt, Trinka felt it was time to ""bow out gracefully."" As he transitions to retirement, Trinka says he'll miss the front-row view of Central Park and the hotel's clientele -- the ""greatest people in the world."" He also concedes he'll miss ""the women."" The building's inhabitants are not eager for his departure. ""He's a gentleman, refined -- you don't find these people anymore,"" lamented resident Joan Spain. Trinka's replacement, Jimmy O'Connell, is keenly aware of the large shoes he'll have to fill, saying he'd be satisfied if he ""could be half the doorman"" Trinka is. The hotel will bid farewell to Trinka in characteristically grand fashion on Thursday afternoon. After a champagne send-off in the hotel's landmarked Oak Room, its management will present him with an opportunity to view the Plaza from the vantage point of the countless guests he's greeted over the years: He'll be given a free stay at the hotel. In addition to a trove of anecdotes about celebrities, Trinka acquired something else during his tenure at the Plaza: a new name. Years ago, the hotel gave him a nametag that mistakenly read Edward, even though his full name is Edwin. He came to embrace the errant nametag, neglecting to correct people when they called him Edward and even naming his own son Edward.","Ed Trinka, who joined the hotel in 1963, turns 65 and retires after 46 years on the job .

"Swine flu may be inspiring fear worldwide, but for Stephan Zielinski of San Francisco, California, it inspired a song. The genes underlying swine flu inspired one amateur musician to compose music based on it. The virus has the classification H1N1 because it includes two key viral proteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Zielinski took the genetic sequence of a variant of hemagglutinin and created a computer algorithm to turn it into music. Zielinski, 41, is not a biochemist or a professional musician -- he's a writer, photographer, computer programmer, and blogger who creates music in his spare time. But he's fascinated that, even though biologists can map the genome of the virus and predict what the hemagglutinin protein looks like, the human body still cannot distinguish it as the ""bad guy"" -- at least, not until there's a vaccine. Listen to the song . ""Although the map is there and you can even make a song out of it, we can't explain it to these itty bitty little cells in body,"" he said. Using computer programs he created himself, as well as a commercial product, Zielinski composed his song by assigning instruments and musical notes to various properties of the protein. Zielinski took the various categories of amino acids, the building blocks of the protein, and assigned each a different instrument -- piano, organ, low synthesizer, percussion. The melody was created by assigning notes to specific amino acids. Each beat of the song also corresponds to one of numerous amino acids. The work was done entirely with a computer and took about six hours Tuesday, he said.  Learn more about swine flu » . He first learned of the sequence through an immunologist friend at the Mayo Clinic, he said. Zielinski saw it as a form of highly organized information that a human did not design. ""The only way I could look at that and make sense of it, since I'm not a biochemist, was, well, I could try translating it into another very organized form of information that people do, and then see if I could hear anything. And the answer, of course, turned out to be no."" But even if the mystery of the virus did not reveal itself in musical form, the result is a curiously melodic, innovative, somewhat soothing work. Dr. Jay Steinberg, infectious disease specialist at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, called it ""nice ambient music"" that's reminiscent of Brian Eno. Less methodical swine flu songs are also emerging on YouTube. User ""CelicaAaron"" parodies the Jonas Brothers' song ""Lovebug,"" crooning, ""I can't get your snout out of my mouth / I'm sick to my stomach all the time.""

"AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (CNN) -- Investigators are trying to determine what caused the crash of an airplane with a good safety record, flown by a well-respected airline, at one of the world's most modern airports. One of the casualties is taken from the crash site. At least nine people were killed and 55 injured when the Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 crashed Wednesday in a field near Amsterdam's main airport, splitting into three parts, officials said. It is too early to determine the cause of the crash but the flight data and voice recorders have been recovered, said Michel Bezuijen, acting mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality, which is home to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. He said investigators still need to determine what, if anything, the pilots said in the moments before the crash. The injured included both crew and passengers, he said. The names of the dead and injured will not be released before Thursday, Bezuijen said. ""It will take more time. Probably tomorrow afternoon we can tell you about the identity of the victims, including the fatalities,"" he said. Another official said earlier that both pilots and an apprentice pilot are among the dead. ""There are still three crew members in the cabin,"" said Bob Steensma of the Dutch Justice Department. ""I'm sorry to say they are dead. We leave them there because we have to investigate the cockpit before we take the cockpit apart."" Turkish Airlines said earlier the plane was carrying 134 people -- 127 passengers and seven crew members. Six people were critically injured, Ineke Van Der Zande of Amsterdam Emergency Services told reporters at a briefing.  Watch aerials from the crash site » . Twenty-five passengers were severely injured, she said, and 24 were lightly injured. Some 60 ambulances transported 84 people to 11 hospitals throughout the region, she said. There was no word on injuries to the others who were transported. Witnesses said they saw the nose of the plane pitch up suddenly before the crash, according to RTL journalist Greg Crouch. The plane broken into three pieces. One break was in front of the wing, splitting the ""Turkish"" logo in two, and a larger break was farther back along the fuselage. Most of the injured were seated toward the back of the plane, which sustained the most damage, a passenger on the plane told Turkish station NTV. Many of the passengers simply walked off the plane through the cracks in the fuselage, witnesses said. A passenger on the plane who spoke to Turkish network DHA said he saw injured people trapped and squeezed between the seats when he walked out. iReport: Send your videos, stories . Flight 1951 was arriving at Schiphol from Istanbul, Turkey, when it went down around 10:40 a.m. (4:40 a.m. ET). It came to rest in a farmer's field about 500 yards short of the runway, near the major A9 highway. Crouch said the weather at the time was partly sunny with no wind or rain. No fire broke out after the crash, Bezuijen said.  Watch how Twitter was first to report the crash » . A bank manager who was a passenger on the plane told NTV that there were no emergency announcements. The crew's last word to the cabin was an announcement to fasten their seat belts and prepare for landing, the bank manager said. He said he felt the pilot giving more power to the engines before feeling ""turbulence,"" then a sudden drop. He described the crash as similar to a sudden impact that was over in a matter of seconds. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of investigators to Amsterdam to assist in the crash investigation. The Boeing 737-800 is a reliable aircraft that has been successful and safe in service, said aviation expert Kieran Daly of Air Transport Intelligence. ""They really are pretty much state-of-the-art airlines with every imaginable technical benefit the industry has come up with over the years,"" Daly told CNN. ""You would be optimistic that they would be quite survivable in an accident."" Daly said Turkish Airlines, a national carrier, has a ""very good record."" Turkish Airlines said it has 52 Boeing 737-800s in its fleet. They can carry as many as 165 passengers each, it said. Before Wednesday, the airline's last accident was of a small commuter jet in 2003, Daly said. It was a fatal crash that happened at a remote airfield in southeastern Turkey, he said. ""Their mainline operation is safe,"" Daly said. ""Their pilots are well thought of."" Worldwide, there have been two fatal commercial airline crashes this year. The last previous fatal incident at the Amsterdam airport happened in April 1994 when a KLM aircraft crashed as it tried to return to Schiphol shortly after takeoff.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sheila Wash greets her son and daughter, 13-year-old Cecil and 9-year-old Sheliah, every day when their school buses arrive ""home."" Sheila Wash says being homeless has been an ""eye-opening experience"" for her. They talk about the school day, their homework and even joke that Sheliah can't remember what she ate for lunch. The fourth-grader wonders aloud, ""What did we have? We had something good."" But it's hardly a homecoming for any of them. The Wash family has been homeless since 2007, after Sheila lost her government job. She says unemployment benefits quickly ran out and, as she searched for a job, the family was forced to move six times in the last two years. They're now living in the Family Forward Shelter in Washington. ""I just thank God we have a roof over our head right now. You have to accept the things that come to you. You don't like them but, you know, until you can get your foot forward, you do what you have to do. We just keep going,"" Wash said. Wash's situation was only made worse as the economic recession set in. Jobs became harder and harder to find with more competition for each position. She says she's still searching. The Washes are part of the changing face of homelessness in America today. For years, homelessness has been depicted as that of an individual man or woman living on the street and begging for money. But with the perfect storm of the foreclosure crisis and the faltering economy, more and more families are becoming homeless. According to a recent count by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the number of homeless families in the Washington region alone has jumped 15 percent since last year. There are several national estimates of homelessness, but many are dated or based on dated information. TheU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development points to a study done in 2007 -- before the brunt of the foreclosure crisis hit --which stated that about 3.5 million people, 1.35 million of them children, are likely to experience homelessness in a given year. That study was conducted by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty . ""People lose their jobs. Their monthly household expenses spiral out of control because maybe their car broke down that month, and when you have such a tight budget with high rental costs, there is no room for error. And so that is what really leads families to the shelter door,"" said Mary Cunningham, author of ""Preventing and Ending Homelessness - Next Steps."" Reflecting on their struggles over the last few years, Sheila calls it ""eye-opening."" ""It's like they say you never know [someone] until you walk in their shoes, so truly I know now and if I ever get out [of] this situation, I will always give back to people less fortunate than I am because I know their struggles,"" Wash said. School officials in Prince George's County, Maryland, where the two Wash children go to school, say a day doesn't go by without the need to enroll another child as homeless. Denise Ross, supervisor for the school district's Homeless Education Office, said they've been inundated with requests. ""Some of them are embarrassed, some of them are scared, some of them are sad. They're just not sure what's going to happen next,"" Ross said. ""Students who are displaced or homeless students feel that school is a safe haven. They really want to come to school. They really want to attend school."" For homeless students, Prince George's County Schools offers free transportation to and from school, free breakfast and lunch, help with school supplies and also clothing. ""Either in the shuffle of being evicted or moving from shelter to shelter or place to place, their clothes may not have followed them. Or may have been set out and somebody may have taken them. So they may only have [the] clothes that are on their back. Our intent is always to provide them with at least three complete sets,"" Ross said. Sheila Wash says school is not only important because of her children's education, but it has also been an important source of stability in their lives. ""[A] very big help,"" she says. And help they still need with the obstacles ahead.  Watch Kate Bolduan's report on the Washes' plight » . The Family Forward Shelter is a hypothermia shelter, only open through the winter, which means the Wash family needs to find another temporary home, and they haven't had much luck. But with a smile that seems to never fade, 9-year-old Sheliah describes the one wish that keeps her family going. ""I wish we had a house with a car,"" she says. ""I pray that my mom, that we wake up in the morning and that [we] get a house and everything we wanted.""","Sheila Wash and her two kids have been homeless since 2007, after she lost her job .

"(CNN) -- At least four people died when a tour bus crashed Tuesday on the Pacific Coast Highway, California Highway Patrol spokesman Brian Wiest said. The crashed bus is on its side across the southbound lanes. ""There were people ejected,"" Wiest said. Highway 101 near Soledad, California, was closed in both directions for about 2½ hours after the crash, which injured 38 people, authorities said. The highway patrol later opened the northbound lanes, using one for northbound traffic and the other for southbound traffic. The crashed bus was on its side across the southbound lanes. The bus belongs to Orion Pacific, a charter service that provides trips ""across the USA and around the world,"" according to its Web site. No one answered CNN's call to Orion Pacific. At least some of the passengers on the bus were French, said Jacques de Noray, spokesman for the French consulate in San Francisco. The Soledad Fire Department said 12 ambulances and seven helicopters were dispatched to the scene. The California Highway Patrol said the crash took place at about 3:23 p.m. while the bus was en route from San Francisco to Santa Maria, about 230 miles down the coast. Soledad is about halfway between the two cities. The cause of the crash had not been determined.","Highway 101 near Soledad, California, closed in both directions .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former congressman and Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp died Saturday at age 73 after a battle with cancer, his family announced. Jack Kemp, a former congressman from New York, was the GOP's vice presidential candidate in 1996. A onetime professional football player, Kemp served nine terms in Congress as a representative from New York and was former Sen. Bob Dole's running mate in 1996. He was a leading advocate of ""supply-side"" tax cuts, advancing the argument that cutting taxes would boost economic growth and yield more revenue for the federal government. ""The only way to oppose a bad idea is to replace it with a good idea, and I like to think that I have spent my life trying to promote good ideas,"" he told CNN in a 1996 interview. Kemp ""passed peacefully into the presence of the Lord"" Sunday evening, a family statement said. He disclosed his illness in January. Watch . ""During the treatment of his cancer, Jack expressed his gratitude for the thoughts and prayers of so many friends, a gratitude which the Kemp family shares,"" the family said.

""He championed free-market principles that improved the lives of millions of Americans and helped unleash an entrepreneurial spirit that all of us still benefit from today,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a statement issued late Saturday. The 1981 tax cuts signed into law by Ronald Reagan, which cut marginal tax rates from 70 percent to 50 percent, bore Kemp's name as a co-sponsor. Critics mocked the policy as ""trickle-down"" economics and pointed to the decade's growing budget deficits as evidence that supply-side theories didn't work, but it has been GOP orthodoxy ever since. Kemp mounted an unsuccessful presidential bid in 1988, losing the Republican primaries to George H.W. Bush.

"Editor's note: Mark Gendreau, MD, is senior staff physician and vice chairman of emergency medicine at Lahey Clinic, Burlington, Massachusetts, and assistant professor of emergency medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. His interests include health issues associated with commercial air travel, including transmission of infectious diseases. Dr. Mark Gendreau says swine flu is focusing attention on how to avoid getting a disease while traveling by air. (CNN) -- The novel swine flu is showing the world just how interconnected we are and how commercial aircraft can serve as vehicles of rapid disease spread. I am frequently asked: What is the risk of catching an illness while flying? In a nutshell, the risk of getting an infection while you're in an enclosed space such as an airplane depends upon three factors: The infectiousness of the contagious person spreading the illness; the degree of your exposure (how close you are to the contagious person and for how long); and the ventilation of the space or passenger cabin. We really have no control over the infectiousness of our fellow passengers, and usually, you really don't have much of a choice about your seating partners. So the exposure is pure chance. But this doesn't mean that you are doomed. Most respiratory viral infectious diseases -- like influenza and the common cold -- transmit via droplets contaminated with the offending microorganism when the infectious person coughs or sneezes. These droplets are propelled no farther than 3 feet and can land on an inanimate object -- such as a seat, overhead bin or seat tray -- or on your body. This is why hand hygiene is so critical and is the single most significant thing you can do to protect yourself and your family when you are traveling or out in public. Study after study shows marked reductions in transmission in public spaces when hand hygiene is practiced, and a recent study found nearly undetectable influenza particle levels after hands contaminated with influenza were washed with either soap and water or an over-the-counter gel containing at least 50 percent alcohol. Sanitize your hands before eating, drinking and after retrieving something from the overhead bin or returning from the restroom, and you have just cut your chances of getting infected by at least 40 percent. One of my disappointments with the airline industry is its lack of providing alcohol-based hand sanitizers to passengers. Such a service would go a long way in eliminating infection spread within aircraft. iReport.com: Have swine flu fears altered your travel plans? Ventilation is the final crucial element to consider in minimizing infection spread. Ventilation dilutes the concentration of infectious particles within any confined space, thereby reducing the probability of infection. Experience shows us that transmission becomes widespread within the passenger cabin involving all sections when the ventilation system is not working -- as evidenced by an influenza outbreak in 1979 involving passengers being kept aboard grounded aircraft with an inoperative ventilation system. Air circulation patterns aboard standard commercial aircraft are side-to-side (laminar), with air entering the cabin from overhead, circulating across the aircraft and exiting the cabin near the floor. Little to no front-to -back (longitudinal) airflow takes place. This air circulation pattern ""compartmentalizes"" the air flow into sections, thereby limiting the spread of airborne particles throughout the passenger cabin. Ventilation can involve either 100 percent fresh air in which outside air enters and leaves the cabin in a single pass or a system in which various fractions of air are recirculated from the aircraft cabin and mixed with fresh air. Most commercial aircraft in service recirculate 50 percent of the air delivered to the passenger cabin for improved control of cabin circulation, humidity and fuel efficiency. The recirculated air usually passes through high-efficiency particulate (HEPA) filters before delivery into the cabin. HEPA filtering of recirculated cabin air to minimize exposure to infectious particles is established within scientific literature, practiced daily in health care facilities and is strongly endorsed by the medical community and cabin health experts. However, oddly enough, the Federal Aviation Administration, its British counterpart, the Civil Aviation Authority, and Europe's Joint Aviation Authorities do not require the use of these filters on commercial airlines. Efforts to improve international regulations regarding the certification, inspection and maintenance of aircraft environmental control systems are needed. To minimize the risk of disease spread by aircraft, regulations requiring HEPA filters for any aircraft that uses recirculated air should be seriously considered. In the meantime, you can improve the ventilation at your seat by turning on the overhead air vent to low and positioning the airflow to be slightly in front of your face. This may create enough air turbulence to push a viral particle from landing on your face and mucous membranes. Finally, face masks are effective. In 2003, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, 76 percent of Hong Kong residents wore simple masks, and in this case, mask use was associated with a lower incidence of SARS, as well as upper respiratory tract infections and influenza. A recent analysis of public health interventions used during the SARS epidemic suggests that the use of masks by the public was 68 percent effective in decreasing rates of infection, with simple face masks, and 91 percent effective for more sophisticated N95 face masks. The take-home message is this: Use a surgical mask when you are traveling to areas that have reported cases of swine flu and bring an additional one to give to anyone near you who forgot one or appears to be sick and is coughing or sneezing. Prevention of a disease outbreak is the most important means of control and requires a proactive approach. The aviation industry and medical community should better educate the general public about health issues related to air travel and infection control. The only way to eliminate any risk of cross-infection in the aircraft cabin -- or the rapid worldwide spread of an infectious agent -- is to prevent would-be passengers who are either substantially exposed to or carrying transmissible infections from flying. This needs to come from education and promoting individual responsibility, since the systematic screening of passengers for contagious diseases is impractical. Although thermal scanners used in airports may detect travelers with symptoms, they are not effective since people exposed to an infectious disease could travel without any signs or symptoms and yet still be infectious. The late Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg once said ""The microbe that felled one child in a distant continent yesterday can reach yours today, and seed a global pandemic tomorrow."" True words.

"(CNN) -- The Humane Society has accused a federally funded primate center of mistreating chimpanzees and other primates, saying that some animals showed signs of psychosis and self-mutilation. New Iberia Research Center cages about 325 chimps on its 100 acres. It also has about 6,000 monkeys. The allegations against the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana, which houses more than 6,500 primates, came after a nine-month undercover investigation. The center denies the allegations. ""We found animals living in isolation, exhibiting self-mutilating behavior, psychosis, all sorts of emotional and physical problems at this laboratory,"" Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle told CNN on Wednesday. The Humane Society's undercover investigator, who worked as a laboratory technician with a hidden camera, revealed 338 violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act, which sets standards for the treatment of animals in labs, Pacelle said. The Humane Society posted some of its secret footage on its Web site. The footage includes an animal with what the group said was a self-inflicted wound, another animal jumping in circles in its cage, and chimpanzees screaming as lab technicians approached with a dart gun. The violations were filed in a 108-page complaint to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is required by law to enforce the Animal Welfare Act, the organization said. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said he will order a thorough investigation of animal welfare practices at the facility. ""If the allegations prove to be true, the American public can expect the perpetrators to be held fully accountable. I take the protection of animals very seriously, and will do my utmost to fully enforce the Animal Welfare Act,"" he said in a written statement. The New Iberia Research Center, part of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, issued a statement saying that the videos ""distort acceptable standard procedures and incorrectly imply mistreatment of nonhuman primates at the New Iberia Research Center."" It added: ""We take very seriously our responsibility to care for the animals housed at the center and to carry out biomedical research according to federal rules and regulations."" The center further said it properly housed and cared for the animals. It also said it complies with regulations of the USDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Humane Society accused workers at New Iberia of hitting primates on the mouth, using ""painful"" dart guns and removing infant monkeys from their mothers. The Humane Society also said it had documented evidence of ""rampant"" breeding of government-owned chimpanzees. In 2007, the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Research Resources, following a 12-year moratorium, said it would no longer breed chimpanzees for research, citing financial reasons. The New Iberia Research Center has received more than $37 million in grants from the NIH, according to the center's Web site. The NIH said it has opened an investigation regarding the allegations and said it is working closely with the USDA. However, it said it could not comment on the allegations while its investigation is under way. ""The results will be available when the investigation is complete,"" the NIH said in a written statement. ""We are committed to the safety and welfare of all animals in research. All animals used in federally funded research are protected by laws, regulations, and policies to ensure they are used in the smallest numbers possible and with the greatest commitment to their comfort."" Pacelle said the most serious issue was the self-mutilation and ""nonstop pacing and circling, psychosis and other abnormal behaviors."" ""These are highly intelligent animals. They have a sense of self, they have a sense of past and future, they have the wide range of emotions that we have,"" he said. ""They should not be subjected to this long-term, decade-long isolation, and all these painful and physical procedures and the psychological torment in these laboratories."" The New Iberia Research Center says it offers a ""broad range of diagnostic, laboratory, and human resources for the development and characterization of nonhuman primate models for applied and basic research aimed at promoting human quality of life."" In its statement e-mailed to CNN, the center said it has made numerous contributions to public health improvements for the prevention and treatment of three forms of hepatitis, mumps, measles, chicken pox and mad cow disease. CNN's Bill Caiaccio and Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.","Society says undercover investigation found animal psychosis, self-mutilation .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- In radio broadcasts and sermons, Taliban militants have been promoting themselves as Islamic Robin Hoods, defending Pakistan's rural poor from a ruling elite that they describe as corrupt and oppressive. Mohammed Daoud, with his son Faisal, is among those who have embraced the Taliban's message. That message has been resonating throughout the Pakistani countryside, where the culture is deeply conservative and the people are desperately poor. In farmlands just 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the center of Islamabad, Mohammed Daoud and his 15-year-old son Faisal eke out a living by cutting grass for their four water buffalo. They feed their family of seven, earning the equivalent of around $50 a month by selling buffalo milk. Two months ago, Daoud said, the government bulldozed his family's house, probably because they were illegally squatting on property they did not own. ""Justice [in Pakistan] is only for people who have money,"" Daoud said, while slicing through handfuls of grass with a small scythe. ""We are illiterate,"" he added, ""but we are hoping that with Islamic sharia law, our lives will get better."" Across this overwhelmingly Muslim country, there is widespread hope that adopting a strict code of law based on the Koran will transform a society where corruption is rampant and where at least a quarter of the population lives under the poverty line. Watch why the Taliban's message would resonate . Enforcement of sharia law is the platform the Taliban have been using to justify recent land-grabs, such as last week's armed occupation of the district of Buner, some 60 miles from the Pakistani capital. In an interview with CNN, Muslim Khan, the Taliban spokesman in the militant stronghold of Swat Valley, denounced the Pakistani government, calling the prime minister and lawmakers ""un-Islamic."" ""They're making money like in a supermarket,"" Khan said, adding that under sharia law both the rich and the poor would be treated equally. Militants have slowly taken over territory in northwestern Pakistan by first targeting unpopular landlords and bureaucrats, according to Amnesty International, the human rights watchdog. ""Its systematic. The Taliban move into an area, they use local existing resentments. They often go in with the guise of being Robin Hoods,"" said Amnesty International representative Sam Zarifi. ""They scare away some local thieves, they impose very, very quick justice, very harsh justice, and initially in some places they are even welcomed."" The Taliban's promise of Islamic justice would be welcomed in farm fields on the outskirts of Islamabad. Rows of wheat -- along with the posh villas of Pakistan's ruling elite -- are within sight of Islamabad's iconic white Faisal Mosque. ""In the present judicial system, even the innocent people are punished,"" said Sajeet Hussein, as he and a group of farmers shared lunch under the shade of a tree. The group explained that they were losing a court battle to stop the government from seizing their land, because they claimed they couldn't afford to bribe policemen and judges. ""Every part of the country should have sharia law, like in Saudi Arabia,"" said Hussein's brother Babar, who sported a long bushy beard. ""Then poor and rich people will be equal."" ""We love the Taliban,"" announced one Pashtun farmer who asked not to be named. He called the militants heroes. Sports star-turned-politician Imran Khan summed up his response to the Taliban in Pakistan by saying, ""The poorer section of society is joining them...this is now developing into a battle between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots.' ""What the Taliban are giving them is cheap -- in fact, free -- accessible justice at the village level,"" he added. ""This is what Pakistan should be doing for its own people."" But if farmer Babar Hussein has his way, Taliban justice would mean taking away freedoms from Pakistani women, like the right to have a driver's license. ""Women should not even come out of their houses. That's against Islam"" he said, while complaining about the un-Islamic fashions he saw women wearing in Islamabad. When Taliban militants overran Buner last week, they told women to stay indoors, warned men to stop shaving their beards, and threatened shopkeepers who sold movies and music. In Pakistan's rural society, male strangers are not even supposed look at local women. And yet, some farmers enjoy blaring Bollywood music and even dancing on trailers full of hay, while driving their gaudily-decorated tractors. If the Taliban's rural revolt succeeds, it could bring silence to the Pakistani countryside.","Amnesty International: Taliban first targets unpopular landlords, bureaucrats .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- China has refused nine U.S. Navy ships and one Air Force jet entry to Hong Kong in the past month, U.S. military officials said Friday. China has refused the USS Reuben James, seen in a 1989 photo, a Christmas port call in Hong Kong. Senior Navy officials said that Beijing denied permission for the USS Reuben James, a Navy frigate, to make a holiday port call for sailors at the end of December. The rejection occurred last week, at the same time China refused to allow the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier battle group into Hong Kong for a Thanksgiving holiday port call. A U.S. Air Force C-17 flight that had been scheduled for a routine resupply of the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong also was denied permission to enter, Navy officials said. The Kitty Hawk battle group was eventually granted permission to enter, but by then the ships were well on their way to port in Japan. Days earlier, China refused to give two U.S. Navy minesweepers safe harbor in Hong Kong during a storm on the high seas. The United States has filed a formal protest with China over the decisions. U.S. officials are baffled about the reason or reasons for the port call refusals. China recently has expressed concerns about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and President Bush's October presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.  Watch China put the blame on the U.S. » . There is speculation that the Chinese may have been conducting military exercises that they didn't want the U.S. Navy to see. Others think the refusals may have been the result of a misunderstanding. Officials could not explain why the rejection of the Reuben James had not been disclosed before, even though reporters had repeatedly asked if there were any other pending port calls. One senior Navy official expressed dismay that the information had not been made public by the Pentagon. White House deputy spokesman Scott Stanzel told reporters the White House is ""aware"" of the latest refusals and referred reporters to the Pentagon. Stanzel said a ""clarification"" on the matter was being sought from Beijing. White House and other Bush administration officials have sought to defuse tensions with China, saying the United States wants to move ahead on broader issues of military cooperation. Navy officials, meanwhile, say Japan is tightening approvals for Chinese navy visits into its ports. Crew members from a Chinese ship making a port call in Japan may not be allowed to tour a Japanese Aegis warship. The U.S.-designed Aegis weapons system enables coordinated operations against threats from aircraft and missiles, surface ships and submarines.

"(CNN) -- The first person ever convicted in Idaho of knowingly spreading the HIV virus is facing new charges for the same offense, authorities said Thursday. An Ada County, Idaho, grand jury on Tuesday returned an indictment charging Kerry Thomas, 45, with seven counts of knowingly transferring the HIV virus, Jean Fisher, Ada County deputy prosecutor, told CNN. In 1990, Thomas was charged with four counts of HIV transmission and two counts of statutory rape, Fisher said. As part of a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty only to the rape charges. According to Fisher, Thomas received a 12-year sentence and had to serve three years before being eligible for parole. He was later granted early release. In 1996, however, Thomas was again charged with one count of HIV transmission, and a jury convicted him, Fisher said. He received a 15-year sentence with a seven-year minimum. Now out on parole, Thomas faces possible life in prison on the new charges because prosecutors are seeking his designation as a ""persistent violator."" It was not immediately known whether Thomas was in custody Thursday. He was not listed online among the inmates in the Ada County Jail.

"BETHLEHEM, West Bank (CNN) -- Hundreds of Christians packed the Church of the Nativity on Thursday for a midnight Mass in what is thought to be the birthplace of Jesus Christ. A worshipper touches a star at the point where tradition says Jesus Christ was born in the Church of Nativity. The standing-room-only service included singing and organ music. There were also large crowds outside the church, one of the most sacred places in Christianity. So many people had flocked to the area this Christmas season that there were no rooms left at the inns and hotels in Bethlehem. Some took this as a sign that tourism in Bethlehem was on the upswing. Christmas is the one time of year when the West Bank's small, shrinking Christian communities show everyone else that they are still there. Before the midnight Mass, Palestinian scout groups representing Christians throughout the West Bank did as they always do on this day -- they marched, banging their drums loudly and, in a way, trying to make a point.  Watch Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations » . The drumbeat has been heard by more and more people, locals say, as tourism has skyrocketed this year. ""This year, tourism is much better than last year -- we reached 1,250,000,"" said Victor Batarseh, the mayor of Bethlehem. ""All our hotels are full around Christmastime. We have 30,000 tourists coming in."" Tourists in record numbers were on hand this year, braving an unusually cold, gray and windy day to watch the parade of drums and holiday songs. ""It's kind of neat to see it in the Middle East, and they're playing Christmas carols and the songs we know,"" said one American tourist. ""I'm loving it, it's just been an incredible atmosphere and just a wonderful learning experience,"" said another. The Latin Patriarch in Jerusalem also came to the birthplace of Jesus, as he does every Christmas Eve, allowed through normally tightly shut gates by Israeli troops. The heavy security is a testament to ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.

"(CNN) -- Swiss super-combined world skiing champion Daniel Albrecht was airlifted to hospital after a sickening crash on Kitzbuehel's Streif course on Thursday. Albrecht nose-dives down Kitzbuehel's Streif course after crashing during training for a World Cup downhill. Albrecht, who was said to have suffered concussion and bruising to a lung, was in training for the weekend's World Cup downhill at the Austrian venue when he lost control approaching the bottom of the run. The 25-year-old received lengthy treatment on the slopes before being flown to hospital at St. Johann, where he regained consciouness before being put in an induced coma. An induced coma puts the brain in hibernation so it can recuperate and allows swelling in the brain to ease. Helmuth Obermoser, the official race doctor, said in a brief statement that Albrecht had bleeding on the brain and a lung contusion. Albrecht took the season's opening giant slalom at Solden in October and scored a second victory and fourth of his career two months later in Alta Badia, Italy, where he became the first Swiss winner in 10 years. Thursday's fall came on a similar section at Kitzbuehel that saw American Scott Macartney suffer head injuries in a crash last season -- an episode that led officials to make changes to the course.","Daniel Albrecht is airlifted to hospital after a sickening accident at Kitzbuehel .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From ancient Phoenician galleys to 21st century super yachts, a lot has changed about the way people travel the high seas over the centuries. The Mirabella V, built in 2003, is the world's biggest single-masted sailing yacht, with a mast that is nearly 300 ft tall. Whether it's one intrepid ""micro-yachtsman"" navigating the Atlantic in a boat the size of a bathtub, or an elite racing team shattering world records in a state-of-the-art catamaran, these voyages all have one thing in common: they have altered the way mankind looks at the world.

The ship was repurposed and commissioned for civilian exploration voyages in 1825. How long: Five years Legacy: Aboard the HMS Beagle, Darwin collected specimens and began to develop his theories of evolution, which would later crystallize in ""The Origin of Species."" Columbus discovers the New World . When: 1492 Who: Italian explorer Christopher Columbus Where: From Spain to the Caribbean The boats: The Santa Maria was a 70 ft, three-masted ship built from pine and oak, that could carry 40 men. The Nina and the Pinta were both smaller, nimbler boats with triangle-shaped masts better for navigating tricky waterways. The square-sail Santa Maria ran aground in modern-day Haiti on Christmas Day 1492. Legacy: Searching for a new way into the East Indies spice route, it was aboard these three ships that Columbus unintentionally discovered the Caribbean. 'Micro-yachtsman' crosses the Atlantic in miniature boat . When: 1993 Who: American Hugo Vihlen Where: Across the North Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Cornwall, England The boat: The Father's Day, the world's tiniest sailboat at a length of 5 ft 4 in, was so small that Vihlen had to roll up into a ball to sleep, and couldn't stand up without opening the hatch and risk taking on water. Likened to a space shuttle, the boat is made from fiberglass-enclosed Airex foam and was fitted with GPS, a water maker, VHF radio and SSB/Ham radio. Legacy: Aboard the Father's Day, Vihlen became the world's first ""micro-yachtsman,"" but it wasn't all smooth sailing -- the boat was surrounded by whales, nearly capsized, and caught the tail end of a hurricane during its 105-day voyage.

When: 1519 Who: Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan Where: Around the world bypassing Cape Horn, South America via a narrow strait The boat: Given to Magellan by King Charles I of Spain, The Victoria was the only one of five ships to complete the trip successfully. Only 18 of its original 237 crew members survived and the ship was so badly damaged it was only kept afloat by the crew continuously pumping water out of the hull. How long: Three years Legacy: During the first ever circumnavigation of the world Magellan discovered a shortcut through a waterway in the southern tip of Chile, which helped sailors to avoid the almost continuous ocean storms off Cape Horn. The voyage also established the need for an international date line -- as the explorers found upon return that their calendars were one day off. Pilgrims sail to Plymouth Rock . When: 1620 Who: The Pilgrims Where: From England to Plymouth Rock The boat: Primarily used as a cargo ship, in this instance the Mayflower, which was estimated to be between 90 and 110 ft, was used to transport 102 English separatists. How long: Two months Legacy: Half the Pilgrims died during the first winter on the Mayflower, but, in America, the ship continues to be a symbol of the bold English separatists who would encounter great hardships while they explored, and established colonies the modern-day U.S. east coast. Cook charts the Pacific . When: 1772-1775, 1778-1780 Who: English cartographer and explorer Captain James Cook Where: Pacific Ocean, Antarctic Circle The boat: Called ""the fittest ship for service I have ever seen"" by Cook, the HMS Resolution was fitted with the most advanced technology of the day, including an ""Azimuth compass,"" an ice anchor, a fresh water distiller, and 24 guns and small cannons. How long: Five years  Legacy: Cook charted maps of the Pacific so accurate that many were still used up until 50 years ago, and proved the nonexistence of the mythical ""Terra Australis"" continent believed to exist in the south Pacific. In the process, the HMS Resolution became the first ship to cross the Antarctic Circle. First solo circumnavigation of the globe . When: 1895 Who: Canadian sailor Joshua Slocum Where: From Boston to Rhode Island The boat: Given as a gift to Slocum in 1892, the rotting 36 ft vessel, The Spray, the sailor restored it for ""$553.62, and 13 months of my own labor."" How long: Three years Legacy: Slocum became the first person in history to successfully circumnavigate the world solo upon his return to Rhode Island in June 1898, inspiring generations of sailors to come. Yacht with tallest mast ever sets sail . When: Built in 2003 Who: Owned by American Joe Vittoria, former CEO of Avis Where: From Portsmouth, England to the Mediterranean Sea The boat: With an overall length of 247 ft, the Mirabella V is the largest single-masted boat in the world. The super-yacht's unprecedented mast extends up nearly 300 ft into the sky, and its main sail is over 16,000 sq ft -- the biggest in the world. Legacy: No expense was spared in the construction of Vittoria's luxurious yacht, which cost over $50 million to build. The Mirabella V spends her winters in the Carribean, her summers in the Mediterranean, and can be rented for around $400,000 per week -- but one tip: there isn't a single bridge in the world that the yacht can sail underneath. Phoenicians build empire on the seas  When: 1200-600 B.C. Who: Expert sailors of Phoenicia's maritime empire Where: Mediterranean Sea The boats: The Phoenicians improved upon the galley -- the ancient ship powered by rows of human oarsmen -- by inventing the ""bireme,"" a galley propelled by a second row of oars. Legacy: Through their skillful use ships to trade valuable Tyrian purple dyes, the seafaring Phoenicians -- who could be considered the world's first ""global capitalists"" -- built a maritime empire from Spain to the Middle East that dominated commercial trade in the Mediterranean for the better part of a millennium. Fastest circumnavigation of the globe . When: 2005 Who: French yachtsman Bruno Peyron Where: Around the world The boat: The Orange II, a 121 ft ""maxicat,"" a catamaran designed for ocean racing, with super heavy-duty sails that can withstand prolonged exposure to heavy winds. How long: 50 days, 16 hours, 20 minutes and four seconds Legacy: The Orange II shattered the previous world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the globe by nearly eight days -- and Peyron and his 12-man crew currently hold the Jules Verne Trophy, the prize given to the world's fastest circumnavigators.","The Pilgrims' voyage on the Mayflower to Plymouth Rock in 1620 .

"(CNN) -- An overcompetitive parent gets into an argument with a stubborn coach because he thinks his child isn't getting enough playing time -- it's a familiar scene on youth sports fields across America. One critic of the Rhode Island plan said giving parents a outlet for petty complaints ""opens up a can of worms."" Now, a Rhode Island senator wants the state to step in and create a formal outlet for the ""concerns and objections"" some parents have. Democratic Sen. John Tassoni Jr. introduced a bill that would create a youth sports oversight council on the state level. The council would act as mediator in disputes between parents of youth athletes and sports officials. In answer to critics, Tassoni said Friday that the notion the bill would mean ""big brother"" could begin to oversee youth sports is a misconception. The bill cites the need for a third party to step in at times, stating that ""parents lack a proper outlet to share concerns and objections about youth sports."" But the parents are the biggest problem, said Matt Rodrigues, general manager and owner of Teamworks youth sports program in Warwick, Rhode Island. ""They are crazy, especially in Rhode Island. The kids on the court are scared because the parents are yelling and screaming,"" Rodrigues said. But the answer, he said, is not to create a council that ""makes decisions we can deal with ourselves."" A similar council exists in Waterford, Connecticut -- run by the town, not the state. ""It kind of surprises me that [Rhode Island would] do it on such a large level like that,"" said Bruce Miller, president of the Waterford Youth Sports Council. Waterford's council is made up of representatives from the town's 11 sports leagues. Tassoni's bill states that at least four of the members of the state council would be regional youth sports representatives. He said the council is needed because right now there is no place to go to resolve disputes. ""There's no place right now to bring a case forward and have a third party take a look at it,"" he said. Under the bill, Republican Gov. Donald Carcieri would appoint seven volunteers -- approved by the state Senate and House -- to sit on a panel called the Rhode Island Youth Sports Oversight Council. Tassoni said the seven-member council wouldn't be made up of politicians, but  ex-coaches, ex-officials and ex-athletic directors. Some adults involved in youth sports aren't happy about it. One blogger posted concerns on the Web site of a Rhode Island newspaper, the Providence Journal. ""Hey Tassoni: What do you do, [lie] in bed and think to yourself -- 'what haven't me and my cronies either screwed up, bankrupted or embarrassed yet? Hmmmm ... haven't touched Little League yet.' Do me a favor -- and I ask this as a coach and a parent -- stay the hell away from my field!!!!"" wrote the blogger. Others think the government should ""concentrate on the state."" Rodrigues of the Teamworks program said giving parents a place to do petty complaining only ""opens up a can of worms."" He said the council just ""sounds like another way to take power away from our programs -- they have enough [power]."" The governor has not taken a position on the legislation and will not until he reviews the bill, press secretary Amy Kempe said Friday. She added, however, that ""there appears to be some vague language and constitutional issues."" The bill states that the volunteers on the council would be expected to ""provide oversight and mediation"" to youth sports programs in the state, as well as develop and adopt a process to review and address complaints. In addition, the council would have the authority to establish and collect fines. But the bill does not go into detail about how to implement the reviewing and fining processes. The bill, with some revisions, is scheduled to be heard by the state Senate on Wednesday. Tassoni hopes to have the council in place by June or July.","Conflicts between parents, coaches and officials all too common in youth sports .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Eight cadets and staff members were killed in Pakistan during an an eight-hour standoff Monday with gunmen who stormed a police training center in Lahore, said Gen. Athar Abbas, a military spokesman. Police fire into the air after retaking the police training center in Lahore attacked by militants. The militants had been holed up on the top floor of a three-story building, said Rehman Malik, the head of the country's Interior Ministry. Security forces gained control of the first two floors and eventually made their way to the top, finally taking control of it and arresting the gunmen Monday afternoon. Television pictures showed security forces firing into the air from the roof of the building after the firefight. ""The operation is over. Four terrorists were killed and three arrested,"" Interior Ministry Secretary Kamal Shah told Reuters. Malik and Abbas confirmed the figures. Abbas added some of the dead militants blew themselves up. The gang of seven gunmen stormed the academy in the Manawan area of the eastern Pakistani city, said Malik. Abbas had previously said 30 people were killed. He cited the error on wrong information by his sources at the scene.  Watch more about the attack » . At a news conference Monday night, Malik named the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, and his followers as the prime suspect in organizing the attack. Mehsud is also accused of plotting the assassination of former PM Benazir Bhutto. At least 78 people were wounded in the attack, authorities said. Lahore is the same city where gunmen opened fire March 10 on a bus carrying members of the Sri Lankan national cricket team on their way to a stadium for a match. The well-coordinated attack wounded at least eight members of the team and killed a driver and six Pakistani police officers. In Monday's incident, the attackers hurled grenades, then stormed the compound and opened fire while officers were taking part in their morning drill. About 800 officers train at the facility, but authorities could not say exactly how many were inside at the time. The attackers, some in police uniforms, took dozens of officers hostage, said Asim Rizwan, spokesman for governor of Punjab -- the province where Lahore is located. Paramilitary forces and the army descended on the scene. Every few minutes, the gunmen detonated explosives or fired on reporters and police personnel outside, sending them scurrying for cover. Angry onlookers pumped their fists in the air and cheered as police led away a suspect they had captured. He had on him a grenade and a knife, officials told CNN. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","Eight cadets are killed during attack in Lahore, top military official says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- From land, water and air, tens of thousands of police officers, federal agents and National Guardsmen are being deployed in an unprecedented effort to make sure the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama is safe. A law enforcement agent looks toward Capitol Hill ahead of the inauguration on Tuesday. ""Right now, we have no credible threat that there is any direction of interest on the inauguration,"" Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan told CNN. FBI agents and intelligence officials have been checking with sources around the United States and the world to make sure no leads are overlooked, and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said intelligence will be scrubbed and rescrubbed right through the inauguration. ""We are literally going to be watching this every minute between now and the conclusion of events on the 20th,"" Chertoff said. Federal officials acknowledge the inauguration of the first African-American U.S. president could be an attractive target. Since Obama's election, the number of threats against him has increased, according to a recent federal intelligence assessment. FBI officials say the number of tips coming in has increased, as is common before an inauguration. Investigations, however, have not uncovered a real threat. The FBI has been especially aggressive in examining white supremacy groups, which have ramped up their anti-Obama comments. ""We have not seen any activity by the groups,"" said FBI Assistant Director Joseph Persichini. ""We have seen a lot of chatter, we have seen a lot of discussions, we have seen some information via the Internet. Again, but those are discussions. We look at the vulnerabilities and whether or not the groups are capable of taking on action."" Persichini said he believes the bureau has ""a good operational plan"" for dealing with the groups, but says that right now, there is no evidence they are trying to launch anything.  Watch more on inauguration security » . The Secret Service is coordinating security for the inauguration, which will involve 58 federal, state and local agencies. All of them are represented at the Secret Service command center, where they can communicate and work together to respond to any report of a possible problem. Airspace restrictions around the Capitol are being tightened. The U.S. Coast Guard is closing portions of the Potomac River. Miles of roads will be closed, along with most of the bridges into the District of Columbia. Checkpoints are going up, and undercover teams are being deployed to look for suspicious people or vehicles. Explosives-sniffing dogs will be on hand to nose out bombs, and horses trained in crowd control are on duty. Thousands of security cameras are being used to monitor activities, sharpshooters are being stationed, and sensors will be used to detect chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. In addition to Secret Service agents, the security effort will involve 8,000 police officers from the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions, 10,000 National Guardsmen, about 1,000 FBI personnel, and hundreds of others from the Department of Homeland Security, the National Park Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Another 20,000 members of the National Guard are ready to respond if there is an emergency, according to Chertoff. Security planners have drawn up procedures to deal with improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and the use of a weapon of mass destruction. A recent intelligence assessment, however, said a lone wolf would pose the greatest potential threat. Chertoff said an individual or small group planning to do harm is difficult to detect. ""Whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society, it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage,"" he said. A major unknown is how large the crowd will be for Tuesday's activities. Estimates have ranged from 1 million to 2 million. The FBI's Persichini said only that ""we know it is going to draw a lot of people here to the nation's capital."" Those attending the swearing-in ceremony or entering the parade route will undergo tight screening, including passing through magnetometers. Spectators who are unable to get into those events will be routed to the National Mall, which, for the first time, will be open from end to end for an inauguration. Security there will be less stringent. There has been extensive planning to ensure the crowds can be moved in an orderly and safe way, and to prevent a stampede if there is any kind of security incident. Local and federal agencies have even consulted with a crowd expert. Authorities say the massive security operation is not intended to deter people from coming to Washington. ""Our efforts are to make sure people are safe,"" Secret Service spokesman Malcolm Wiley said. ""We'd like for as many people to come as want to come. And again, during our planning, we have made sure we could accommodate however many people decide to come."" That inaugural events are spread over a four-day period has made security even more challenging. Organizers say they started their security planning the day after the last inauguration and ramped up their efforts in July. Officials involved say this is the biggest event they have been involved in, but believe they are prepared. ""There are a lot of things we all think about, and I'll admit that at 3 in the morning, I might wake up thinking about something, but I have to tell you, I am so confident in this plan,"" the Secret Service's Sullivan said. ""I just don't see any benefit to worry, and I think we just have to go along the way we're going right now and do everything that we can do to make sure that this event is going to be a safe event, that this historical event will be an enjoyable event for everybody and that, quite frankly, that the day isn't about security, but the day is about our president and the day is about our country.""","Officials say Obama's historic inauguration poses high security risk .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India on Wednesday urged Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels to ""release"" civilians, who it said numbered about 70,000 in Sri Lanka's war zone. A Sri Lankan soldier poses in front of a Tamil Tigers emblem in the rebel group's former military headquarters. India is ready to help evacuate them, External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Indian parliament. ""Estimates on the number of civilians trapped vary, but 70,000 or so are estimated to be there now. The LTTE were reportedly using them as human shields,"" he said, referring to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, also known as the Tamil Tigers. ""As the conflict enters what may be the final phase of military operations, the LTTE would best serve the interest of the Tamils by immediately releasing all civilians and laying down arms,"" Mukherjee added. He noted that some civilians had either been caught in cross-fire or ""stopped and even killed"" by Tamil rebels as they tried to escape. Government troops and the Tamil Tigers are locked in a battle over the rebels' remaining territory in northern Sri Lanka's Vanni region. The rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. Tens of thousands of people have fled the region as government forces have advanced and rebels have been pushed into a smaller and smaller patch of land.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- An Iraqi soldier fatally shot two American soldiers and wounded three others on Saturday, the U.S. military said. A man lies in a hospital after a roadside bombing near Kirkurk on Saturday. Three Iraqis were killed. The shooter was killed when U.S. soldiers returned fire, Maj. Derrick Cheng told CNN. The incident took place at a combat outpost just south of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, where there has been a strong presence of anti-U.S. militants, and it underscored the dangers for U.S. troops and Iraqi security forces in that city. A second gunman also fired on other U.S. soldiers at the outpost and fled, said Cheng, a spokesman for the U.S.-led Multi National Division-North. Iraq's Interior Ministry said the gunman was a soldier in training who was standing close to U.S. soldiers when he aimed his firearm at them and began shooting. There have been similar incidents of men in Iraqi security force uniforms in the Mosul area opening fire on U.S. troops. In February, insurgents dressed as Iraqi police officers killed a U.S. soldier and an interpreter in the city. Asked whether there seems to be a rise in such attacks, Cheng replied, ""We still view these as isolated incidents either by individuals posing as Iraqi Security Forces or members acting out on their own."" ""These events do not represent the overall relationship or partnership U.S. forces have with our Iraqi counterparts."" Overall, violence and attacks are down in Iraq, but despite improvements in the big picture, the U.S. military is concerned with hot spots such as Mosul. Maj. Gen. David Perkins, MNF-Iraq spokesman, told reporters on Friday that the city remains a danger. He said the U.S. military is studying whether American combat troops scheduled to withdraw from urban centers in Iraq by June 30 should actually remain in the diverse metropolis -- populated by Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Christians and others. Perkins said al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) militants ""are transitioning and becoming more and more concentrated ... mainly in Mosul and in Baghdad."" ""What we have always said with regards to al Qaeda is that strategically for AQI to win they have to win Baghdad and for them to survive they have to hold on to Mosul and you can see that by how they are conducting their attacks."" In the last couple of weeks, he said, militants have focused their activity on Baghdad, and attacks in Mosul have dropped somewhat. ""But there is still a lot activity. This is probably the main area we are looking at that could possibly result in U.S. forces being there,"" he said of Mosul. ""Probably more so than any other place."" ""Of all the places in Iraq, it is the area that you would most likely possibly see a very similar U.S. presence to what you see now. But only if Iraqis want that."" U.S. troop fatalities in Iraq last month reached 18, the highest of the year. However, the number of monthly Iraqi troop deaths have plummeted since earlier in the war. Also on Saturday, Iranian forces targeting Kurdish rebels shelled a village in Iraq, an official from Iraq's Kurdish region said. Forces used helicopters to attack the village and shelled it with artillery. The village is just over the Iranian border in Iraq's Sulaimaniya province -- a Kurdish region. No casualties were reported. Iran and Turkey long have targeted Kurdish separatist rebels operating in northern Iraq. Meanwhile in Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, three civilians were killed and three others were wounded when a roadside bomb struck their vehicle on Saturday, police said. It is not known who the bomb might have been targeting, but the incident reflects the hostilities in the oil-rich and ethnically diverse city.","NEW: U.S. military: Gunman who killed 2 U.S. troops, wounded 3 was Iraqi soldier .

"CNN -- The number of cholera deaths in Zimbabwe is now approaching 3,000, the World Health Organization says. Two men rest in a cholera rehydration tent on the South Africa-Zimbabwe border in December. Latest, WHO statistics show 2,971 deaths since the outbreak began in August, with 56,123 cases reported. The epidemic has swept through a country wracked with political and economic crises. Cholera is an intestinal disease caused by bacteria in contaminated water. The epidemic has been aggravated by erratic water supplies, shortages of water purification chemicals, broken water and sewer pipes and uncollected garbage. On top of that, the waste-disposing system has collapsed. Children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in Zimbabwe. Last month, the government led by President Robert Mugabe declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency. The country already was wracked by an enormous economic crisis, with a hyperinflationary economy and shortages of all essentials including food, fuel, cash, foreign currency and electricity. Zimbabwe's rainy season peaks in January or February and ends in late March, and Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned the epidemic could get worse during the rainy season.","WHO figures show 56,123 reported cholera cases in Zimbabwe .

"(CNN) -- Chris Rock is best known for two things: being funny and being crass. ""If you're the president you only have two jobs: peace and money,"" Chris Rock said. ""This is what people come to see. I'm just doing my show,"" the comedian said with a laugh. He's also known for his political commentary, but there's one person he's having a lot of trouble making fun of -- president-elect Barack Obama. This is apparent in his new DVD ""Kill the Messenger,"" which combines three shows from his international tour: New York; London, England; and Johannesburg, South Africa. ""It was a tour nobody wanted to do... because the general perception is that comedy doesn't translate,"" Rock said. But thanks to the Internet, the world is a lot smaller than it was even 10 years ago. And people are digging the same jokes, he said, including ones about John McCain and Sarah Palin. As the DVD readies for release on January 20, CNN talked with Rock about his lack of Obama jokes, Inauguration Day and why racism will never die. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: I watched the special last night, and I noticed that you did a lot of jokes about John McCain -- his age, his war hero story -- but not so many about Barack Obama. Is it harder to make fun of Obama? Chris Rock: He's just one of those guys, you know, like Will Smith. There's no Will Smith jokes. There's no Brad Pitt jokes. You know, what are you going to say? ""Ooh, you used to have sex with Jennifer Anniston. Now you have sex with Angelina Jolie. You're such a loser."" What do you say? ""Ooh, your movies are big. You make $20 million."" There's nothing to say about Brad Pitt. CNN: Why is Obama like that? Rock: It's like ""Ooh, you're young and virile and you've got a beautiful wife and kids. You're the first African-American president."" You know, what do you say? CNN: As time goes on do you think it will get easier? Rock: Of course, as time goes on. At some point he's going to -- there's always slip-ups. No one can survive that level of scrutiny without occasionally making it easy for a comedian. CNN: Let's talk about the inauguration. Are you going? Rock: No, I have to go to Sundance [Film Festival]. I've got a movie premiering at Sundance. So I have to go to the whitest place in America -- Utah. CNN: What's it going to be like for you on Inauguration Day? Rock: It'll be a cool day. It's weird. I've never watched an inauguration. I've never watched anyone get sworn in. You know, it's like Election Day and then you look up and somebody else is the president two months later. It was never like, ""I can't wait till tomorrow. Oh my god! They're going to swear in Jimmy Carter!"" CNN: Are you going to watch this one, though? Rock: I'll put it this way -- like any business is going to be getting done while this guy is getting sworn in. Like I'm going to be in a meeting. Everything is going to stop for however long it takes. Hope they get to it -- hope it's not like I gotta listen to three different versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" or something. I hope it's not like Rosa Parks' funeral, where everybody f***ing speaks. CNN: What are you hoping Barack Obama does for this country? What do you think is his most important task? Rock: You know, if you're the president you only have two jobs: peace and money. That's it. I mean, it's like, what did Clinton do? We were at peace and we had a budget surplus. That's it. That's the gig. The closer you get us to those two goals, you know, that's pretty much the gig. Is that too much to ask for? CNN: At one point in your act, you said, ""Racism will never die. It will only multiply."" Why do you believe that? Rock: Well, it's never going to die. Maybe it won't multiply. Is racism going to end? No. It's not even race. People are always going to, you know, find something wrong with people who are not the exact same as them. That's just what it is. Black, white, short, tall, religions, whatever. People are bad, man. CNN: How was it different playing for an audience in Africa? Rock: You know it's weird -- it really wasn't that different. I mean, that's why I love this special. People are the same wherever you go. And if they weren't, they wouldn't laugh at the same s**t. If they were so different they wouldn't know what I was talking about. CNN: Stand-up comics I've talked to in the past say they like their shows to appear spontaneous. But your new DVD stitches together three shows, illustrating to the audience how scripted comedy can be. Why did you decide on that format? Rock: You know, I don't believe in that ""come up with stuff on the spot."" I mean, honestly, that's why I think comedy, stand-up comedy, always plays such a back seat to music. Like, would you go see a singer if you thought he just came up with the songs? They wouldn't give out Grammys for songs that they just came up with. You're going to go see someone at Radio City or Madison Square Garden, I think you'd like to know that they have an act before you spend $75. So yeah, when you say ""came up with it right there,"" that's really cute when you paid $8 to get in and two-drink minimum. When the ticket's $75, that's a whole other mindset.","Comedian Chris Rock to release ""Kill the Messenger"" DVD January 20 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- One of two doctors charged with conspiring to furnish drugs to Anna Nicole Smith before her fatal overdose in 2007 surrendered to authorities and was jailed Monday, authorities said. Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend Howard K. Stern was among those charged last week. Dr. Khristine Eroshevich surrendered at the Van Nuys, California, jail, said police and jail officials. Bail was set at $20,000, but Eroshevich had not posted bail as of Monday afternoon. Eroshevich was charged last week along with Howard K. Stern, Smith's longtime partner and attorney; and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor. Stern and Kapoor were arrested and released from a Los Angeles County jail Thursday night after each posted a $20,000 bond. All three are charged with eight felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007, only weeks before Smith's death. Kapoor and Eroshevich were also charged with obtaining a prescription for opiates by ""fraud, deceit or misrepresentation."" And each was charged with one count of obtaining a prescription for opiates by giving a false name or address, prosecutors said. ""Anna was the center of a cruel tabloid feeding frenzy,"" Eroshevich's attorney, Adam Braun, told CNN in a statement Monday. ""In the face of this, Dr. Eroshevich did her best to help the patient while protecting what little privacy Anna had left. Any actions were done with the patient's well-being in mind and were certainly not criminal."" California Attorney General Jerry Brown said the doctors and Stern devised a plan to use fake names so Smith could be prescribed ""thousands of pills."" The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star was drugged ""almost to the point of stupefaction,"" Brown said. ""The quantity of the drugs, the variety of the drugs, the combination at any given point, and her continuing to use that -- that, to a professional, is clear evidence of addiction,"" Brown said Friday. ""These cocktails of methadone and antidepressants and sleeping pills and Xanax, you put all that into a cocktail, it explodes and can cause death, injury and permanent morbidity and disability."" Brown said Stern was the ""principal enabler"" in a conspiracy with two doctors for giving the ""known addict"" thousands of prescription pills. Stern's attorney Krista Barth said on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Friday night that she thought Brown's comments were prejudicial. ""I don't think that this was something that should have been stated in a public forum,"" Barth said. ""I think it's contrary to the rules of professional conduct regarding trial publicity. And you have to wonder why such a statement was made."" Smith, 39, was pronounced dead February 8, 2007, after being found unconscious in her hotel room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino near Hollywood, Florida. A coroner said she died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. Officials said that both prescription and over-the-counter drugs were found in Smith's system, including three antidepressant or anti-anxiety drugs. Human growth hormone and chloral hydrate, a sleep medication, were also found in toxicology tests, officials said. CNN's Marc Balinsky contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawyer: Doctor had ""patient's well-being in mind,"" actions ""not criminal""

"(OPRAH.com) -- It's the story that has brought dating violence into the national spotlight. Police responded to a 911 call alleging domestic violence between singers Chris Brown and Rihanna last month. Tyra Banks tells Oprah Winfrey about how abuse affected her. Later that day, both pulled out of planned appearances at the Grammy Awards, and Brown turned himself into police. He was arrested on the suspicion of making criminal threats and was released on bail. Weeks later, rumors of their reconciliation were reported. On March 5, 2009, Brown appeared in court, charged with two counts of felony assault. His arraignment has been postponed until April 2009 while he remains free on bail. Statistics say about one in three high school students have been -- or will be -- involved in an abusive relationship. ""The message this story sends to teen girls and boys everywhere is disturbing, and it is also dangerous,"" Oprah Winfrey says. ""We need to try to evolve from this moment ... use this as a moment to allow our society to begin to grow."" Oprah believes this story can be a teaching moment for every teen and parent. ""Love doesn't hurt,"" she says. ""And if a man hits you once, he will hit you again."" Oprah.com: 10 questions to ask your teens . Over the past few years, talk show host Tyra Banks has interviewed both Brown and Rihanna. ""Rihanna told me her parents used to argue so intensely, she used to get these headaches, these migraines that were almost not even treatable with medicine,"" Banks says. ""The moment her parents separated, her migraines went away."" In his appearance on The Tyra Banks Show, Brown said he watched his mother suffer abuse from the time he was 7 years old until he was 13. The abuser was not his biological father. ""I treat [women] differently because I know I never want to go through the same thing or put a woman through the same thing that the person put my mom through,"" Brown told Banks. When Banks first heard about the alleged incident, she says she didn't believe it -- until the police report was released. ""I went back to that interview and I said, 'Oh my God, he's repeating [the cycle of abuse].'"" Tyra cautions against judging Rihanna for going back to Brown. ""Sometimes we hold these celebrities up to a higher standard, but we have to look at her as a human being and understand that she is no better or no different than any other girl,"" Banks says. ""She is just as easily pulled into the cycle of abuse of going back."" ""I think we need to send love to both of them,"" Oprah says. ""For him to be healed, and for her to be healed also."" Oprah.com: 4 ways to heal after a tragedy . Banks says she knows the cycle of abuse all too well. While in her 20s, Banks says she was emotionally abused. ""He never hit me, but I would say there were blows to my spirit, blows to my emotional well-being every day,"" she says. On the outside, Banks says no one could see the signs. But behind closed doors, she says he was jealous and blamed her for his bad moods. ""He was a master at being able to be happy and nice to everybody else but whispering these negative things to me,"" she says. ""I'd start complaining to my friends, and they're like: 'Well, he's fine, girl. He's fine with us. Everything's fine.'"" Although she was one of the top 10 models in the world at the time, she says her self-esteem sunk lower and lower. ""I stayed because I felt like if I left and he didn't change and didn't treat me how I felt I deserved to be treated, I was a failure,"" she says. One day, Banks says she finally confronted herself. ""I walked to the mirror in his bathroom. He wasn't there,"" she says. ""Out loud I looked in that mirror and I said: 'Tyra, who are you? What the hell are you doing? Get out of here.'"" Although Banks says she tried to leave her boyfriend many times, she managed to get sucked back into the relationship. At one point, she says she turned to her mother for help. ""I said: 'Mama, please, just take me. Pull me out of this relationship. Tell me to leave him. Hole me up in your house. Unplug the phones. Protect me from him.'"" Her mother refused. ""[She said:] 'You have to do this on your own. I will be here as somebody to support you in this. But I will not tell you to leave, and I will not cut you off from him, because you'll just run out in the middle of the night and go straight back.'"" Oprah.com: How to make an exit plan .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- He is the international superstar responsible for breathing life into the iconic comic book hero Wolverine. Her movies have earned more than $2 billion worldwide, including the entire ""X-Men"" franchise. Hugh Jackman emerges as Wolverine in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which opened Friday. Actor Hugh Jackman and film producer Lauren Shuler Donner recently sat down for a candid conversation about their new film, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" Specifically, the pair talked about the scene in which Jackman's character is transformed from a simple mutant with bony claws that periodically protrude from the back of his hands to an invincible mutant filled with an indestructible metal called adamantium. This scene represents the ultimate birth of a comic legend as the character is transformed from Logan to Wolverine.  Watch the scene in which Wolverine is unleashed » . Hugh Jackman: I knew this was the birth of the character; this is where we see him in full flight. It's called in the comic book ""berserker rage."" It's not really in the English language, but it may be now! But, this idea that this complete animal [has been] unleashed, which is obviously the entire story -- this battle between the animal and human is something we all relate to. Lauren Shuler Donner: There were many things he had to do in the tank, you know. One of them was he had to be lowered, and then the needles had to come towards him. Now, most of those were CGI, so he had to look in certain places where the needles were. But, he couldn't hear [director] Gavin [Hood]. So they ... tried all kinds of sounds, speakers, everything. ... They finally devised this toe method where, if Gavin pulled on Hugh's big toe, it meant the things are coming, the second toe is this, the last toe is rise up, very sophisticated. (laughter) Jackman: I had in my head that I've got to be in much better shape -- not better shape, different shape, kind of ridiculous shape because I wanted it to be uncomfortable. I wanted it to feel like I felt when I saw Robert De Niro in ""Cape Fear,"" that -- whoa, this guy is dangerous, he's powerful, he's dangerous, and he can snap at any point. Donner: There's an iconic drawing of Wolverine coming out of the tank in the comics with the things popping out of him and his hair all over him in a rage, and we wanted to be that image. That's the image we wanted for the fans. Jackman: I was a little frightened when I watched it, like, ""Is that me?"" [My wife] Deb was like, ""Hugh, this is ridiculous.

"(CNN) -- The fiberglass head weighed 600 pounds and resembled Clarabell the Clown from the 1950s ""Howdy Doody Show."" Bill Ziegler, owner of the Wild Bill's nostalgia store, stumbled across it on an artist's Web site and wondered if it would work for a project he had in mind. Salem Sue stands watch in New Salem, North Dakota. She measures 38 feet tall and 50 feet long. Ziegler recruited the artist to help him attach the giant head to his 33-foot farm silo. By October 2008, the pair had built the world's largest jack-in-the-box. The jack-in-the-box extends 50 feet in the air, moving up and down approximately once a minute. ""They love it,"" Ziegler said of the tourists who come to his store. He's had visitors from as far away as England -- one couple who saw the story of the jack-in-the-box in a British newspaper decided to stop by. All across the country, roadside attractions like this one bring surprise and delight to travelers who just have to get a closer look. ""In many parts of the country, you can plan an entire road trip where you visit nothing but 'world's largest' attractions,"" said Doug Kirby, the publisher of RoadsideAmerica.com. Kirby's Web site pays homage to odd attractions -- from Ziegler's jack-in-the-box in Middletown, Connecticut, to the world's largest ketchup bottle in Collinsville, Illinois, to the world's largest sundial in Carefree, Arizona. ""Travelers enjoy the noncorporate, somewhat ragged nature of these eclectic attractions,"" Kirby said. ""They're often free, and you can take a great 'wish you were here' photo.""  See photos of some ""world's largest"" attractions » . Kirby picked five world's largest attractions from his Web site. In addition to Ziegler's jack-in-the-box, here are his top recommendations for adventurous road trippers: . Ball of twine . Visitors do more than snap a picture at the world's largest ball of twine in Cawker City, Kansas. Linda Clover, self-described keeper of the ball, gives tourists twine to add it to the attraction. ""People like to be a part of it,"" Clover said. ""It shows that with lots of patience and a lot of people helping out, you can end up with something very big."" Clover ended up in charge of the ball in a roundabout way. Farmer Frank Stoeber started the ball of twine in 1953. When he died, his cousin took over. And when his cousin died, Clover stepped up. ""I know that people like to come and see it. And someone had to take care of it,"" she said. ""My husband used to say that people asked me to do something and I couldn't say no."" Clover keeps twine with her in case an interested tourist gives her a call. The ball measures more than 40 feet across. It contains 7.9 million feet of twine and weighs approximately 19,000 pounds. And every year in August, Cawker City hosts a twine-a-thon event to hold on to the world's largest ball of twine record. Salem Sue . Salem Sue, dubbed the world's largest cow, is in New Salem, North Dakota. She measures 38 feet tall, 50 feet long and is made up of 12,000 pounds of fiberglass. Scott Schauer, producer of The Real North Dakota project, features Salem Sue on his Web site, which is dedicated to showing tourists the best of North Dakota. As a kid, Schauer used to drive by the cow with his family. He thinks many people pass similar road trip traditions on to their kids, hence their appeal. ""I remember being mesmerized by their monstrous size. No matter how many times I saw them, I always looked forward to seeing them again and again,"" Schauer said. ""As an adult, I still look forward to seeing them. I guess some things don't change with time."" Horseshoe crab . The world's largest horseshoe crab resides in a parking lot at the Freedom Worship Baptist Church in Blanchester, Ohio. Last year, the church's pastor, Jim Rankin, hired Evel Knievel's former bodyguard to jump over the crab on his motorcycle. The publicity stunt attracted nearly 8,000 visitors to the church. The crab is 68 feet long from its head to its long, spiky tail. ""It can have up to 65 people inside,"" Rankin said. Peanut . In the 1970s, Ashburn, Georgia, built a monument to the state's No. 1 cash crop. Standing atop a brick tower along Interstate 75, the world's largest peanut can be seen for miles. The peanut is 33 feet tall with a 10-foot circumference. The peanut was featured on a Go-Gurt portable yogurt packet as a trivia question, said Shelley Zorn, Ashburn's chamber of commerce president. It also showed up on a Food Network show. ""Hilarious, isn't it?"" Zorn said of the public's love affair with the peanut. ""I can meet people on a cruise ... and I ask them if they've seen it. Nine out of 10 people have seen that peanut, no matter where they're from."" A legacy . Recognition is the main reason people build the world's largest attractions, Kirby said. His site rates places higher if they surprise his staff or make them laugh. iReport.com: See the ""world's largest rocking chair"" ""Towns build giant statues to promote themselves and take pride in local heroes, historic figures or industries,"" Kirby said. ""Businesses commission creation of giants so they stand out from their competition. For individuals, a 'world's largest' something may be a hobby gone out of control. ... Creators fret about their legacy. This 'world's largest' may be how the world remembers them.""

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's Maoist government took the president to task Monday for ordering the country's army chief of staff to stay in office after they had fired him, calling the decision ""unconstitutional."" General Rookmangud Katawal gestures after inspecting a guard of honor in New Delhi on December 12, 2007. ""Neither the constitution nor the Military Act gives the President the right to do anything besides supporting the government's decision,"" said Krishna Bahadur Mahara, the minister for information and communication. Late Sunday night, President Ram Baran Yadav ordered Gen. Rookmangud Katawal, who was sacked by the government Sunday morning, to continue in office. Nepal's interim constitution gives the president powers as supreme commander of the army and guardian of the constitution. ""The president took the step after 18 parties in parliament requested the President to intervene,"" presidential spokesman Rajendra Dahal told CNN Sunday night. The decision to fire Katawal touched off protests. Supporters of both sides in the dispute took to the streets for demonstrations Sunday. Despite sporadic clashes between the two factions, there were no serious injuries reported. The coalition government led by the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) -- better known as Maoist -- leads a minority government for which its largest coalition partner, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist), has withdrawn support. It is unclear if the government will fall, since Madhesi Janadhikar (People's Rights) Forum, another coalition partner and the fourth largest party in parliament, is undecided about staying in the government. Nepal's Cabinet voted to dismiss Katawal after the military refused the government's order to stop recruiting about 3,000 new soldiers to fill vacant positions when it has yet to take in former Maoist rebels, as a 2006 peace deal required. The Maoists laid down their arms and won power in 2008 elections after an agreement that ended a decade-long insurgency. Under the deal, more than 19,000 former insurgents were to be integrated into the country's security forces.","Government calls president's order to keep army chief in office ""unconstitutional""

"(AOL Autos) -- Have you ever heard of someone having their car ""totaled""? While the word might conjure images of a massive car accident, replete with broken glass and the Jaws of Life, the reality is sometimes far removed. Ford's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck. In fact, there are many accidents that produce structural damage such that the vehicle's frame is bent, even though the exterior of the car might even look drivable. Typically these cars are ""totaled,"" which might give buyers the peace of mind knowing they will get a replacement vehicle. But, overall this produces much higher insurance rates for all drivers. Car companies and insurers are working hard to try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers and some of the development is breathtaking in its innovation . This effort has already led to many new developments in the design of various auto parts and components -- which have indeed led to a reduction in repair costs for various auto parts, components and structures. And more advances are on the way: some carmakers have recently ramped up their operations in this area, which should result in greater cost savings in coming years. One recent development in this area is the Ford Motor Company's new $650,000 Paint and Body Technology Center in Inkster, Michigan, about 20 minutes from the company's Dearborn world headquarters. The new center was created by merging operations with the company's Safety Crash Test Analysis department. Other car companies have their own versions of this kind of operation, including Ford's crosstown rivals, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC. The new Ford center represents an advancement over its previous paint and body tech operation in that it's larger, closer to the company's HQ, and now works more closely with design engineers and auto insurers -- and gets insurers involved earlier in the design process. AOL Autos: Cut your insurance in half . The goal is to identify potential repair issues and then use that info to refine designs -- which in turn helps cut the cost of repairs at dealerships and independent repair shops. Plus, this effort allows repair techs to more effectively restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition. To that end, engineers gather data earlier in the vehicle development process so it can be then analyzed during crash and durability testing. AOL Autos: How to choose a repair shop . For Ford, the closer integration of these functions began when the carmaker's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck. During the vehicle's early development period, these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer, but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision. AOL Autos: Minor damages, major repair costs . ""The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,"" said Gerry Bonanni, Ford's collision repair senior engineer. So, Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash, instead of having to replace the entire frame. ""Partial-frame repairs cost at least $2,000 less than full-frame replacements,"" says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being ""totaled,"" which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states. The success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center. A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang. ""Previously, we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails,"" says Bonanni. ""But, by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies, we developed a procedure, which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers. ""That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails, instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system -- which also translates into lower repair costs, and lower insurance rates, for the owner."" General Motors' Collision Repair Test Center has had also had recent success on this front, says Jim Doherty, GM's manager of the service-engineering team for aftersales body structures. ""We coordinate with the product engineers, so as soon as a new vehicle starts development, about four years before it's introduced, we engage with their team,"" says Doherty. ""Some of our people work on the structure, and some on the exterior, and we collaborate with the design engineers to work out whatever improvements might need to be made over the previous version of a component or assembly."" AOL Autos: Best & worst auto designs . As with Ford, ""the goal is to make sure that the vehicle has the most cost-effective repair strategy,"" adds Dave Bakos, GM's director of global after-sales mechanical engineering. ""Our liaisons with people in the insurance industries are definitely useful -- they call us if they have concerns, and when we develop a new technology, we contact them to make sure they understand it."" The development of lighter-weight steel for auto frames also presents challenges to GM's center. ""They're very high-strength, but their repairability is more difficult when compared with the old cold-rolled steels -- so, that has forced us to come up with new welding, sectioning and attachment strategies as the vehicle is being designed and developed,"" says Doherty. AOL Autos: Take the guesswork out of buying a used car . Doherty and Bakos cite a couple of examples of how the Collision Repair Test Center -- and the collaboration between design and repair engineers and insurance companies -- have been parlayed into cost savings for car owners. Prior to the current model year, the cost of repairing the frame-rail assembly on a Pontiac Solstice included $936 for the part itself, plus 13 ½ hours worth of labor costs to install, says Doherty. But by working with design engineers and insurers, the Collision Repair Test Center was able to develop and create a ""service-only"" partial assembly. That means that, on the '09 Solstice, a collision technician can replace the damaged section of the front rail only, rather than the entire front rail section. The parts for the partial assembly cost far less and require just three and a half hours of labor to install,"" says Doherty. ""Because of these changes, the total cost savings for this repair could be as high as $1,500."" The current Saturn Aura presented a challenge / opportunity along the same lines. For the '09 Aura, GM engineers at the Collision Repair Test Center created ""zone-specific"" replacement parts. ""Rather than replacing the entire body-side assembly as a single piece, engineers developed sectioning procedures for the front, center and rear quarter sections of the vehicle,"" explains Doherty. ""This allows the technician multiple repair options when repairing the side of a damaged vehicle. Even though the cost of parts remained similar, labor cost savings created were substantial, ranging from about $600 to as high as $1,200."" One current focus for these operations at Ford, GM and other carmakers relates to side-impact crashes. ""We don't want every vehicle to have to end up in the salvage yard just because a side pillar is damaged,"" says Bakos. ""So we're working on some combination of welding or welding and adhesives, or maybe mechanical fasteners, in order make those sections more repairable, so that the vehicle isn't totaled."" New challenges continue to present themselves, says Ford's Bonanni. ""New technologies are developing pretty rapidly,"" he says. ""And each time a new one comes along, it's our job to develop new ways of repairing the various structures, components and parts that incorporate those new technologies -- and do it in a way that maintains the vehicle's after-crash structural integrity, and keeps costs down for the vehicle owner.""","Companies and insurers sections cars to be crash (and repair) friendly .

"LONDON, England -- Two kisses on the cheek or three? The age-old dilemma may become moot as worries of infectious disease hang in the air. A couple kisses at a swine flu virus prevention and detection medical mobile unit in Mexico City. Common forms of greeting, such as handshakes and kisses on the cheek, are coming under scrutiny as the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu, steadily spreads around the world. In Mexico, which has had the largest outbreak of the virus, the Ministry of Health is advising people to avoid shaking hands and kissing people as a greeting. Some couples are donning surgical masks when they kiss to avoid contagion. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent who has been covering the epidemic from Mexico, is advocating the ""el-bump,"" or bumping of elbows, as a greeting. ""It's not as cool as the fist bump, but safer,"" he wrote on micro-blog site Twitter. Follow Dr. Gupta's 'tweets' Dr. Richard Dawood, medical director of the Fleet Street Travel Clinic in London, refers to the shift in etiquette as ""social distancing."" ""People don't want to get too close. There is going to be a move towards less handshaking, less greeting people with a kiss. There may well end up being fewer meetings,"" he told CNN. The World Health Organization is advising people to practice preventive measures like avoiding close contact with people who appear unwell and those who are coughing and have a fever. The global health agency is also directing people who live in areas where flu cases have surfaced to follow additional precautions set out by their national and local health authorities. Even countries where the virus hasn't been confirmed are taking precautionary measures. At a news conference earlier this week, Lebanon's health minister recommended that people stop using the conventional greeting of three kisses to the cheek.  See where cases have been confirmed » . ""We're heading toward a world where everyone is going to be suddenly much more conscious of those who are coughing and sneezing,"" Dawood said. People will have to be much more conscious of hygiene and stay out of close proximity with others when they aren't feeling well, he said. Are you changing your etiquette because of the swine flu epidemic? Tell us in the SoundOff below . The H1N1 virus is a hybrid of swine, avian and human flu strains. It is a respiratory disease that is contagious, and believed to be spread through coughing, sneezing and close contact.  Learn more about the virus » . Since the outbreak surfaced in Mexico, it has spread to at least 11 countries.

"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana, to look at recovery from Hurricane Katrina in the Lower Ninth Ward compared to the rest of the city. The Lower Ninth Ward Health Clinic was clinic director Patricia Berryhill's home before Hurricane Katrina. NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Patricia Berryhill sits behind a desk in what not too long ago was her living room, cheerfully greeting those who walk in and reaching for the phone as it rings yet again. ""Lower Ninth Ward Health Clinic, Patricia Berryhill, may I help you?"" Sometimes the questions are routine -- this time more anxious. ""As for the HIV testing, if you come in on Tuesdays from 11 to 1, there is no charge,"" Berryhill tells the caller. ""As for the Herpes virus, you are going to have to see a physician and make an appointment for that."" The patient files in the cabinets behind her now number more than 1,300, and 95 percent of those who walk through the door have no health insurance. The clinic asks for a $25 ""co-payment"" but no one is turned away if they cannot afford it. A half dozen patients are waiting as executive director Alice Craft-Kerney takes a visitor on a tour. In the reception area, there are health awareness brochures, hurricane preparedness brochures, and a bookshelf about half-filled with children's books. Craft-Kerney tries every day to give some away.  Watch John King preview this Sunday's show » . ""Because we have such a low literacy rate here in Louisiana,"" she says. ""So they come by, browse, and take whatever books they want free of charge."" The staff is cheery; the clinic neat and clean. A sign in the window making clear there are no narcotic drugs inside is a sign of the clinic's rough surroundings. And within a few steps of the door is a reminder that 43 months after Katrina changed everything, the Lower Ninth Ward is still a mess. During a helicopter pass over the neighborhood, we saw concrete slabs and weedy spaces where houses once stood. Yes, there is a fair amount of new home construction, and renovations under way at some homes gutted by Katrina. But while the debris is mostly gone, much of the neighborhood remains an abandoned wasteland. Overall, Tulane University geographer Richard Campanella says, the population of New Orleans stands at about 330,000 -- roughly 75 percent of its pre-Katrina level. Before the storm, it was about 70 percent African-American; now it's about 60 percent. And it is a more affluent city. Campanella says median household income is up to $40,000 from $27,000 before Katrina, ""and it is not because the city is doing better economically."" Significantly, Campanella says the ""curves"" suggesting major changes during the post-Katrina period are ""flattening."" ""My sense is the post-Katrina city we all wondered about 3½ years ago what would it look like -- that we are there now,"" Campanella said in an interview on the Tulane campus. ""The patterns are stabilizing and we are in a 'new normal' period."" A new normal in which the Lower Ninth Ward trails significantly behind. Only about 19 percent of its pre-Katrina population has returned; roughly 3,600 people live there today, compared to some 19,000 when Katrina hit. There are new twists on the resentments and suspicions that dominated community discussions in the horrible days just after Katrina and Rita. In the place of resident complaints that their neighborhood was slow to get help in the hours and days after the storm are accusations their rebuilding hopes are being deliberately ignored or set on the back burner. Craft-Kerney says a commitment to add a second school in the Lower Ninth, or enticements to bring in a supermarket or a major pharmacy, would help bring more people back, or attract new residents. ""Much of it has been the lack of political will on the part of our government entities,"" she said. City officials say there are myriad reasons the rebuilding is slow. One part of this divisive debate is the threshold question of whether it makes sense at all to have people living so close to where the levee breach was most destructive. But Craft-Kerney and many other community activists see this debate in black and white, or rich and poor. ""As my teacher used to say, 'Them that got, gets,' "" she said. The Bush administration's response to Katrina was one of the turning points in American public opinion toward that administration. But Craft-Kerney says the clinic would not be in operation had it not been for the help of Mike Leavitt, the Bush secretary of health and human services. It sits in what was Berryhill's home. After Katrina, she decided to move elsewhere in the city, but agreed to donate her former home as a clinic. It was gutted, rebuilt, and Berryhill now serves as its clinical director. It survives mostly because of a Bush administration grant that runs through 2010. Whether the clinic gets additional federal funding will be one of the tests of the area's priority for the federal government. Craft-Kerney will soon face the new administration. While she speaks highly of President Obama, she says she worries New Orleans and the Lower Ninth will be forgotten in the long list of major challenges facing his administration. ""I don't know exactly what his game plan is,"" Craft-Kerney told us during the clinic interview. ""But I do believe in my heart that he is going to eventually do some things to help New Orleans.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Hundreds of people converged on New York's Union Square Friday for the May Day Immigration Rally, calling for workers' rights and a path to citizenship for the country's nearly 12 million undocumented immigrants. New Yorker's support the rights of undocumented workers on Friday at a May Day rally. The annual event, which began in 2006, was organized by the May 1st Coalition for Workers and Immigrants Rights. Similar rallies were scheduled across the nation in Boston, Massachusetts; Detroit, Michigan; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco in California, and San Antonio, Texas, according to the group's Web site. Following rally cries from speakers in both English and Spanish, demonstrators braved a rainstorm and marched approximately two miles to New York's Federal Plaza. Among the participants was Saul Linares, who emigrated from El Salvador six years ago and works at a Long Island factory making equipment for the U.S. Army. Linares is particularly concerned about children who are American citizens, yet whose illegal immigrant parents have been deported. ""The children are living alone, sometimes with relatives, at churches or with neighbors,"" he said. Teresa Gutierrez, a co-coordinator of the event, blames current government policy for the United States' immigration woes. She said she believes the Clinton administration's landmark 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA -- which was meant to promote cross-border growth between the United States and Mexico -- actually had exploitive effects on the Mexican population. ""Immigrants came because of NAFTA. They don't risk their lives crossing the border because they want to, but because they have to,"" she said. A smaller anti-illegal immigration rally assembled across the street, organized by the New Yorkers for Immigration Control and Enforcement. Charles Maron, a New York firefighter and husband of a first generation Pakistani, believes illegal immigrants who commit crimes should be deported. ""Someone who comes, teaches their kids the American way, I support that."" Participants in the May Day rally included people from Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. According to Gregory Jesus Luc, who is producing a documentary about the plight of Haitian immigrants, ""It's about awareness, letting media and America know that we are immigrants and we are the backbone of this country.""","May Day rally seeks path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A 16 year-old Australian schoolgirl is hoping to achieve a sailing feat that is so tough it has brought many experienced men and women to the brink of death. Sixteen-year-old Jessica Watson of Australia plans to sail solo around the world . Jessica Watson, of Mooloolaba, Queensland, plans to set out on a solo round-the-world sailing mission in November -- and hopes to become the youngest person to ever sail non-stop around the world alone. But with the impending weeks of solitary confinement, freeze-dried foods, changing conditions and threat of injury, illness or death -- why would she want to do it? Watson told CNN her inspiration had come from fellow Australian Kay Cottee, who became the first woman to sail the globe alone, without stopping; and German-born Australian Jesse Martin, who still holds the record as the youngest person to do it. Martin achieved his feat in 1999 aged 18 (at the finish), and subsequently wrote a book titled ""Lionheart: A Journey of the Human Spirit."" ""I read Jesse's book and that was inspiring. If you had to put it down to one thing that encouraged me to do this that would be a good one,"" Watson said. Since deciding she wanted to take on what she describes as the ""Everest of the ocean"" about four years ago, Watson has been doing all she can to gain the best preparation for the adventure. She has already sailed ""mock solo"" across the Tasman Sea, which flows between Australia and New Zealand, at 15 and has been sailing since she was 8 years-old. ""I've been talking to people [who have done it] about it all, and I'll get in some good solo miles before I go,"" she said. Despite the experience she has gained, Watson admits there are some aspects of the journey that remain unknown. ""There are definitely things I'm nervous about -- like the big waves and gear failure. But, it's amazing the detail of preparation we can get and what you can do with technology. ""Though, there's no telling how you'll handle yourself when you're out there for eight months until you're actually out there."" Watson's journey around the globe is part of what seems to be an increasingly popular trend among young sailors. Seventeen year-old Briton, Mike Perham is currently part-way through his attempt to sail the world solo for charity. Perham is at present stuck in Tasmania, Australia, with gear problems and faces the daunting task of sailing around Cape Horn during the winter season. Still, he has come a long way when many people had raised concerns about the voyage before he departed. On his daily blog, Perham writes about the challenges of being at sea alone, ""The first few days at sea are always the worst -- the lack of sleep leaves me feeling drained all the time but I know I just need to keep pushing on, knowing that I'll soon acclimatize and that things are going to get better and better."" Another teenager -- 16 year-old Zac Sunderland, who is from California -- is also on a mission to become the youngest sailor to achieve the feat. Sunderland has also progressed from his departure point in California, through the Panama Canal, and into the Atlantic Ocean. For Perham, Sunderland and Watson it was the high level of communications technology at the teenagers disposal as they sail that has convinced their parents to allow them to attempt their journeys. Would you allow your teenage daughter or son to sail solo around the world? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . On Sunderland's Web site his father, Laurence, said, ""Although Zac is alone as he sails, he really has so much help. There will always be people who will disagree with our decision to let Zac go on this trip. It was his idea and it is his desire to continue."" Watson said her parents had also been supportive from the outset. For the young sailor, the next big challenge is preparing the boat for departure and securing a final sponsor to help fund the journey. She said her life is primarily geared towards the challenge this year. ""It might take a little bit longer to finish school ... this puts everything else on hold.""","Sixteen-year-old Jessica Watson plans to sail solo around the world .

"(CNN) -- ""Global declines in press freedom"" persisted last year, with setbacks highlighted in Israel, Italy, Taiwan, Hong Kong and elsewhere across the world, an annual survey said Friday. Media freedom campaigners don gags during a news conference in Hong Kong in April 2008. Freedom House, a nongovernmental organization that supports democracy and freedom of the media, said in its annual press freedom survey that ""negative trends"" outweighed ""positive movements in every region, particularly in the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and North Africa."" ""This marked the seventh straight year of overall deterioration. Improvements in a small number of countries -- including bright spots in parts of South Asia and Africa -- were overshadowed by a continued, relentless assault on independent news media by a wide range of actions, in both authoritarian states and countries with very open media environments."" Israel -- once the only country to be consistently rated free by the group in the Middle East and North Africa -- was ranked as ""partly free"" because of the Gaza conflict. The report cited ""increased travel restrictions on both Israeli and foreign reporters; official attempts to influence media coverage of the conflict within Israel; and greater self-censorship and biased reporting, particularly during the outbreak of open war in late December."" Elsewhere in the Middle East, there are concerns about harassment of journalists and bloggers in Libya, Iran, Syria, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. The drop in violence in war-torn Iraq helped journalists move around the country, and a new law in the Kurdish region gave journalists ""unprecedented freedoms."" Hong Kong, which is part of China, also dropped in rankings from free to partly free, a reflection of ""the growing influence of Beijing over media and free expression in the territory."" ""Of particular concern were the appointment of 10 owners of Hong Kong media outlets to a mainland Chinese political advisory body, increased restrictions on film releases in the period surrounding the Olympics, and reports that critics of Beijing encountered growing difficulty in gaining access to Hong Kong media platforms."" The report cited deterioration of of freedoms in Taiwan, which has been characterized as East Asia's freest media environment. That's because of ""legal pressures and attempts to control broadcast media outlets."" Italy dropped from free to partly free because of the ""increased use of courts and libel laws to limit free speech, heightened physical and extralegal intimidation by both organized crime and far-right groups, and concerns over media ownership and influence,"" the report said. It cited fears about media magnate Silvio Berlusconi becoming prime minister again. There are concerns about ""the concentration of state-owned and private outlets under a single leader."" In the former Soviet Union, ""legal pressure and attempts to control broadcast media outlets"" were cited in Russia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The report noted other problems in Russia, saying ""reporters suffer from a high level of personal insecurity, and impunity for past murders or physical attacks against journalists is the norm."" Across Africa, there were ""some improvements,"" citing developments in Comoros, Sierra Leone, Angola, and Liberia. But there were continued problems in places like Zimbabwe and Eritrea. ""Senegal took a significant step backward due to a dramatic increase in both legal and extralegal action against journalists and media houses, accompanied by overtly hostile rhetoric from the president and other officials,"" the report said. The report cited strides in South Asian nations, ranking the once ""not free"" Maldives to ""partly free."" It mentioned a ""new constitution protecting freedom of expression, the opening of additional private radio and television stations, the release of a prominent journalist from life imprisonment, and a general loosening of restrictions after the country's first democratic presidential election in October."" It said Bangladesh and Pakistan reversed declines in freedom of the media. But there were setbacks in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, two countries racked by warfare. In some countries in the Americas, such as Mexico, Bolivia and Ecuador, ""attacks and official rhetoric against the media escalated."" Venezuela and Cuba were ranked as not free, and there were ""high levels of intimidation and self-censorship"" in Colombia and Guatemala. Positive developments were noted in Guyana, Haiti and Uruguay. The worst-rated countries in the world are Myanmar, Cuba, Eritrea, Libya, North Korea and Turkmenistan. ""Given the current economic climate, which is certain to place a further strain on media sustainability and diversity in rich and poor countries alike, pressures on media freedom are now looming from all angles and are increasingly threatening the considerable gains of the past quarter-century,"" the report said.","Annual survey says ""negative trends"" outweighed ""positive movements"" in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Police are examining grainy hotel surveillance video and following up on new leads, including a reported sighting, in the case of a 17-year-old girl who traveled to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for spring break last week and then disappeared. Brittanee Marie Drexel's mother says she thought her daughter was at a beach in New York, not South Carolina. The possible sighting of Brittanee Drexel was on a bus Wednesday morning in the Myrtle Beach area, according to police, who later showed photos of her to passengers. As investigators try to build a timeline of the events leading to Brittanee's disappearance Saturday night, they are also scrutinizing hotel security video for signs of a young woman in distress, or other clues. Brittanee's mother, Dawn Drexel, told HLN's Nancy Grace that she had forbidden the Rochester, New York, high school junior from going to Myrtle Beach, a popular destination for high school and college students on spring break. Although they stayed in touch by phone and spoke on Saturday, Drexel said she believed the girl was in Rochester when she actually was in Myrtle Beach. ""I didn't have any idea that she was going to do this,"" Drexel said. ""I do trust my daughter, and she needed to cool down a little bit because she was upset that I wasn't going to let her go."" Drexel said her daughter rode there in a car with several friends. She thinks Brittanee used money she had earned and borrowed to finance her trip.","Police show girl's photo to bus passengers after reported sighting .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The swine flu virus that has sparked fear and precautions worldwide appears to be no more dangerous than the regular flu virus that makes its rounds each year, U.S. officials said Monday. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said swine flu is no more danerous than the regular flu virus. ""What the epidemiologists are seeing now with this particular strain of U.N. is that the severity of the disease, the severity of the flu -- how sick you get -- is not stronger than regular seasonal flu,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Monday as the worldwide number of confirmed cases of swine flu -- technically known as 2009 H1N1 virus -- topped 1,080. The flu has been blamed for 26 deaths: 25 in Mexico and one in the United States, according to the World Health Organization. Still, Napolitano noted, the seasonal flu results in ""hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations"" and roughly 35,000 fatalities each year in the United States. There are still concerns that the virus could return in the fall, in the typical flu season, as a stronger strain. ""We are cautiously optimistic that this particular strain will not be more severe than a normal seasonal flu outbreak,"" Napolitano said.  Watch Napolitano assess the swine flu risk » . Napolitano acknowledged claims by health officials in Mexico, the epicenter of the H1N1 outbreak, who believe their cases have peaked and said, ""I have no reason to think that is inaccurate."" The WHO said there were no immediate plans to raise its alert to the highest level, Phase 6. That designation would mean ""that we are seeing continued spread of the virus to countries outside of one region,"" Assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda said. ""If you are seeing community outbreaks occur in multiple regions of the world, it really tells us if the virus has established itself and that we can expect to see disease in most countries in the world."" In the United States, the CDC on Monday reported confirmed 279 cases across 36 states -- 60 more than were confirmed the day before. Several states, including New York and Massachusetts, confirmed dozens more cases Monday that were not immediately added to the CDC tally.  See where the H1N1 virus has spread across the world » . Earlier, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the CDC ""erroneously"" doubled the cases in his state. Jindal confirmed his state's total is seven, and the CDC dropped its nationwide count from 286 to 279. Many of the cases are among children; the median age is 16, said Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the CDC. The youngest confirmed case is a 3-month-old, he said. There are also more than 700 probable cases across 44 states, Besser said. ""This likely represents an underestimation of the total number of cases across the country,"" he said, because not everyone with flu-like symptoms goes to the doctor and gets tested. The numbers are expected to increase. Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's interim deputy director for public health, said Sunday, ""We believe we're just on the upswing here."" But in Mexico, where the first cases were reported, illnesses may have peaked for now. Mexico City will reopen government offices and restaurants Wednesday, and museums, libraries and churches Thursday as officials cited improvements in the battle against swine flu. Officials said university and secondary students can return to class Thursday while younger students will wait until May 11. In another sign of improving conditions with the H1N1 virus, federal officials lowered the nation's health alert level Monday from red, or ""high,"" to orange, or ""elevated."" ""The measures we have taken, and above all the public's reaction, have led to an improvement,"" Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said at a news conference. ""But I insist that the virus is still present, that we need to remain on alert, and the resumption of activities will be little by little, not all at once."" The Mexican and Chinese government sent chartered flights to each other's countries Tuesday to pick up their respective nationals stranded or quarantined because of the global swine flu outbreak. An Aeromexico flight was making several stops throughout China to collect nearly 70 citizens who were being held in quarantine across the communist nation as part of its strict swine flu-control measures. The flight will make stops in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern city of Guangzhou. Meanwhile, a U.S. Embassy official said four Americans are or were quarantined in China: two in Beijing; two in the southern Guangdong province. The official could not say whether the two in Guangdong had been released, nor did she provide additional details. In the U.S., residents gripped by concerns about the swine flu, also had a hopeful sign Monday. The St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens, New York -- which had the first confirmed U.S. cases of swine flu -- reopened Monday. More than 100 St. Francis students had come down with flu symptoms two weeks ago. Some were tested and found to have the H1N1 virus.  Learn more about the H1N1 influenza virus » . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was on hand to welcome them back  to a school that had undergone an intense scrub-down. ""The school has been completely sanitized,"" St. Francis Principal Leonard Conway said in a letter to students and their parents. The U.S. Department of Education said that 533 schools were shut Monday, about 100 more than Friday and about half of 1 percent of all schools in the United States. The closures affect about 330,000 students in 24 states. New cases of swine flu were leaving soldiers isolated in California. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marine Base at Twentynine Palms, north of Palm Springs, California, said two new cases of the flu were confirmed by the CDC. The two Marines show no symptoms but are being kept in isolation, spokeswoman Jennie Haskamp said. Previously, one other case was confirmed at the base. The U.S. Defense Department also reported that a crew member stationed aboard the USS Dubuque in San Diego, California, was confirmed to have swine flu and is currently ashore. The department said there were 13 other ""probable"" cases among Dubuque personnel. And California officials were looking into a suspected case at Centinela State Prison in Imperial County. Authorities suspended visitation and other ""non-essential activities"" at the prison pending confirmation. Even as health officials worldwide worked to battle the outbreak, intense efforts were under way to develop a vaccine -- with lessons from history in mind. ""In 1918, the Spanish flu showed a surge in the spring and then disappeared in the summer months, only to return in the autumn of 1918 with a vengeance,"" WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said Sunday. ""And we know that that eventually killed 40 million to 50 million people."" Health officials are not making such dire predictions in this case. And they can't know for certain whether the swine flu will make a big return later in the year. Still, they're taking no chances. In that effort, health officials have a tool unlike anything they've had before. ""This is the best surveillance we've ever had,"" Fukuda said Monday. ""You know, we're really monitoring and able to see a situation unfold in a way we have never been able to do in history before."" In Hong Kong, about 200 hotel guests and 100 staff members at the Metropark Hotel remain under quarantine until Friday after health officials determined that a guest there had contracted the H1N1 virus.  Watch how a British citizen has been quarantined in Hong Kong » . ""We go down to the lobby for food and then back to the room to eat your food,"" said Leslie Carr, a British man who is one of the 300 stuck at the hotel. ""Not many people are downstairs hanging around to talk or discuss anything."" Hong Kong, in particular, is extra careful after a SARS outbreak in 2003 killed almost 300 people. ""In view of the lack of data ... we have to be very cautious,"" said Yuen Kwok-Yung of Hong Kong University. ""I believe that as time goes by, we can change our strategy.""

"DHAKA, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Army convoys are combing areas around the Bangladeshi border guard headquarters, vowing to punish participants in this week's bloody mutiny, which killed nearly 100 army officers and civilians, according to The New Nation newspaper. Bangladeshi firefighters continued to uncover bodies Friday of Bangladesh Rifles officers from a mass grave. More than 160 army officers were inside the headquarters of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) when the mutiny broke out on Wednesday morning, local reports said. So far, 88 bodies have been recovered from mass graves in the outskirts of Dhaka, the newspaper reported. At least 22 bodies have also been recovered from the Buriganga River after the rebelling troops dumped them down a sewer during the standoff, authorities said. The 88 found dead were among those 169 officers, the newspaper reported. Another 27 emerged from their captivity in the headquarters of the BDR, a 65,000-strong paramilitary outfit primarily responsible for guarding the country's borders. About 200 BDR soldiers have been arrested. The mutiny began Wednesday when BDR members took dozens of their superiors hostage. It was the second day of BDR Week, when army officers and troop members from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. The New Nation reported that the mutinous border guards surrendered their weapons on Thursday after the government declared an amnesty. The rebellion was spurred by years of discontent among the ranks of the BDR troops. Recruits complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and opportunities to participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Bangladesh and its South Asian neighbors contribute the most troops to U.N. operations and the pay is far greater than the meager salary the jawans -- as the BDR troops are called -- make.","Bangladeshi army vows to punish participants in this week's bloody mutiny .

It recommended that the Obama administration designate them as ""countries of particular concern"" or CPC. The group has issued a watch list that includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, Egypt, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela, countries that don't rise to the level of a CPC but need to be monitored. ""Unfolding events in Pakistan make clear the relevance of this theme to the 2009 Annual Report. At the time of writing, emboldened Taliban-associated extremists had advanced to within 60 miles of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad,"" the report said. ""In the areas they already control, these groups are imposing draconian restrictions on human rights and religious freedom and engaging in brutal acts against individuals, particularly women and local police, who refused to accede to their repressive policies."" The federal commission is bipartisan, and its commissioners are appointed by the president and members of Congress.

"CLARENCE CENTER, New York (CNN)  -- Recovering all the bodies from Thursday's deadly passenger plane crash may take four days as investigators work through freezing temperatures and piles of wreckage, a federal transportation official said Saturday. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. ""The medical examiner believes that three to four days are going to be required to recover the victims of this crash, and they're in the process of doing that,"" Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board said. ""They've already pulled some of the folks out of there, but they've got a long way to go."" All 49 passengers aboard Continental Connection Flight 3407 died when the 74-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, on Thursday night. A 61-year-old man in the house died also, but his wife and daughter survived. Fifteen bodies have been recovered, and efforts to identify the victims and conduct autopsies are under way, Erie County Health Commission Anthony Billittier said Saturday evening. A federal disaster mortuary team was called to assist local forensic officials. Despite reports from local authorities who said the plane hurtled toward the house from a sharp nosedive, Chealander said the current orientation of the plane indicates that it fell flat on its belly. The Continental flight from Newark, New Jersey, operated by Colgan Air, crashed about 10:17 p.m. Thursday northeast of Buffalo Niagara International Airport.  Follow the plane's path » . Chealander said the recovery effort and the investigation have been hampered by freezing temperatures as authorities try to sift through the wreckage of the flight and the home it struck. Some parts of the plane have fallen as deep as the basement, he said. ""Keep in mind, there's an airplane that fell on top of a house,"" he told reporters. ""The house and the airplane are together."" Authorities said it would probably take weeks to identify remains of the victims, with DNA testing required in many cases because of the intensity of the crash and subsequent fire. A 2-square-mile area around the crash site, about 6 miles from the Buffalo airport where the plane was headed, remained sealed off Saturday as investigators sought to determine the cause of the crash. But the extent of the restricted area belied the concentrated force of the impact into the one house.  Watch what investigators are saying » . Karen Wielinski was watching television inside the house when she heard a plane making an unusually loud noise. ""I thought to myself, 'If that's a plane, it's going to hit something,' "" she told Buffalo radio station WBEN. ""And next thing I knew, the ceiling was on me,"" she said. Wielinski and her daughter Jill, 22, were in the front of the home, and they escaped the house with minor injuries. Wielinski's husband, Doug, who was in the dining room, was killed. On Friday, federal investigators released information from the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, indicating that icing may have been a major factor in the crash. The plane's pilot and co-pilot discussed ""significant ice buildup"" on the plane's windshield and wings as it descended toward the Buffalo airport. The plane underwent ""severe"" pitching and rolling motions after the landing gear was lowered and wing flaps were set for the approach, Chealander said. There was a mix of sleet and snow in the area, but other planes landed safely at the airport about the time the flight went down. Chealander said the flight crew reported that visibility was about 3 miles and there was snow and mist as they descended. The voice and data recorders indicated that the plane's internal de-icing was on during the landing approach, he said. ""A significant ice buildup is an aerodynamic impediment,"" he added.  Find out why » . Keith Burtis was driving about a mile from the crash site when he heard the impact. ""It was a high-pitched sound,"" Burtis said. ""It felt like a mini-earthquake.""

"JIANGYOU, China (CNN) -- A Chinese police officer is being hailed as a hero after taking it upon herself to breast-feed several infants who were separated from their mothers or orphaned by China's devastating earthquake. Police officer Jiang Xiaojuan, 29, was feeding nine babies at one point. Officer Jiang Xiaojuan, 29, the mother of a 6-month-old boy, responded to the call of duty and the instincts of motherhood when the magnitude-7.9 quake struck on May 12. ""I am breast-feeding, so I can feed babies. I didn't think of it much,"" she said. ""It is a mother's reaction and a basic duty as a police officer to help."" The death toll in the earthquake jumped Thursday to more than 51,000, and more than 29,000 are missing, according to government figures. Thousands of children have been orphaned; many others have mothers who simply can't feed them. At one point, Jiang was feeding nine babies. ""Some of the moms were injured; their fathers were dead ... five of them were orphans. They've gone away to an orphanage now,"" she said.  Watch the officer care for babies » . She still feeds two babies, including Zhao Lyuyang, son of a woman who survived the quake but whose breast milk stopped flowing because of the traumatic conditions. ""We walked out of the mountains for a long time. I hadn't eaten in days when I got here, and my milk was not enough,"" said that mother, Zhao Zong Jun. ""She saved my baby. I thank her so much. I can't express how I feel."" Liu Rong, another mother whose breast milk stopped in the trauma, was awed by Jiang's kindness. ""I am so touched because she has her own baby, but she fed the disaster babies first,"" Liu said. ""If she hadn't fed my son, he wouldn't have had enough to eat."" Jiang has became a celebrity, followed by local media and proclaimed on a newspaper front page as ""China's Mother No. 1."" She's embarrassed by the fuss. ""I think what I did was normal,"" she said.

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN)  -- A pregnant British woman facing possible execution in Laos will go on trial this week, the country's foreign affairs ministry said Monday. Samantha Orobator became pregnant in prison, according to a spokeswoman for rights group Reprieve. Samantha Orobator ""is facing death by firing squad for drug trafficking,"" said Clare Algar, executive director of Reprieve, a London-based human rights group. Orobator, 20, was arrested on August 5, said Khenthong Nuanthasing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman. She was alleged to have been carrying just over half a kilogram (1.1 pounds) of heroin, Reprieve lawyer Anna Morris told CNN by phone from Vientiane, the Laotian capital. ""For that amount of heroin the sentence is normally the death penalty,"" she said. Orobator's mother Jane found out in January her daughter was pregnant -- more than four months after she was arrested, her mother said. Jane Orobator heard the news from the British Foreign Office, which has been monitoring the case, the mother told CNN by phone from Dublin, where she lives. She cannot believe her daughter was involved in drug trafficking, and was surprised to learn she was in Laos, she said. ""I don't know"" what she was doing there, she said. ""The last time she spoke with me, she said she was on holiday in London and she would come to see us in Dublin before returning to the U.K. in July. ""She is not the type of person who would be involved in drugs,"" she added. Reprieve is worried about her health, especially given her pregnancy, Anna Morris said. ""She became pregnant in prison. We are concerned that it may not have been consensual and we are concerned that someone who finds herself in prison at 20 is subject to exploitation,"" she said. She is due to give birth in September, the lawyer added. Reprieve sent Morris from London to Laos to try to help Orobator, Algar said. The lawyer arrived there on Sunday and is hoping to visit Orobator on Tuesday, her boss at Reprieve said. A British consul has also arrived in the country. ""Reprieve heard about her case two weeks ago. We had thought yesterday the trial was going to start today,"" Algar said Monday. ""We have now heard from Anna that it is not going to."" ""I am the first British lawyer who has asked for access to her,"" Morris said. ""She needs to have a local lawyer appointed to her. We are pressing very hard for the local authorities to appoint one."" She said it was normal in the Laotian justice system for a defendant to get a lawyer only days before a trial. The last execution in Laos was in 1990, the foreign affairs spokesman said. British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell issued a statement about Orobator on Saturday. ""The British Government is opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. We have made the Laos authorities aware of this at the highest levels in Samantha's case,"" he said. ""We are paying close attention to her welfare and are in regular contact with the Laotian authorities about her case. British Embassy officials, including the Ambassador, have visited her six times since her arrest,"" he said. ""In addition, Britain's consular representatives in Laos, the Australian Embassy, including the Australian Embassy doctor, have visited Samantha 10 times on our behalf,"" he said. There is no British Embassy in Laos. A British vice-consul arrived in the country this weekend, the Foreign Office said Monday. Rammell plans to raise the Orobator case with the Laotian deputy prime minister this week, he said. Samantha Orobator was born in Nigeria and moved to London with her family when she was 8, her mother said.

"STUART, Florida (CNN)  -- The most expensive item on Florida's list of economic stimulus projects is drawing fire from some residents and at least one public official, all questioning whether it's needed at all. Some residents say it's wasteful to spend money on a new bridge when there's one less than three miles away. The proposed $128 million Indian Street Bridge across the St. Lucie River has been debated in Martin County, Florida, for more than 20 years. But now that it has been cleared to receive money from the federal government's nearly $800 billion economic stimulus effort, the debate may be over. Critics say the span, which will connect the communities of Palm City and Stuart, is wasteful because there is already a bridge that connects the two communities less than three miles away. ""The president should know that this is a boondoggle, and he is getting swindled,"" said Odias Smith, who has been fighting the bridge for decades and is suing the state Department of Transportation to try to stop it. Mike Mortell, chairman of the Martin Metropolitan Planning Organization, said the existing Palm City bridge ""is in fine shape,"" but a bigger bridge is needed. ""It just simply doesn't have the capacity to move more cars over it,"" Mortell told CNN. ""It is at capacity. Every day, as many cars that can go over it during the rush hour times go over it."" Supporters say the new bridge will ease traffic congestion, aid hurricane evacuations and create about 3,500 jobs. ""Those of us in favor of the bridge can't believe that we became so fortuitous that in a time of a recession when jobs are down that we actually found the money and have the opportunity to build this bridge that we've been planning now for literally over 20 years and now it's a reality,"" Mortell said. Martin County Commissioner Sarah Heard, one of the few county officials who oppose the bridge, said traffic does back up at the existing bridge. But she said the congestion can be resolved without spending money on a new bridge. ""There are some impediments at either end of the bridge,"" Heard said. ""There are stoplights there that are timed so that travelers get stuck at the lights. They don't get stuck on the bridge."" And Smith said he uses the Palm City Bridge regularly and never has a problem with traffic. ""My house faces that bridge. You can see the cars go over it. I go over at 50, 55, all the time,"" he said. Another source of contention between Martin County residents is whether the proposed project is ""shovel-ready"" -- a major test for stimulus projects, which are aimed at getting people back to work quickly. But Heard said the state has yet to buy all the property it needs for the right-of-way leading to the bridge, and that challenges from the current owners of those parcels could delay construction. ""I'm flabbergasted, to tell you the truth, because my understanding of the stimulus money was it was supposed to be for shovel-ready projects that could be completed in three years. This is not shovel-ready,"" she said. ""We haven't acquired the land necessary for right of way. We don't have plans for it."" The Florida DOT says it has purchased 33 of the 63 pieces of property it will need to complete the bridge, and it expects to have all of them acquired by February 2011. But Smith said some people might refuse to sell. ""There's people there who want to stay. It's either their dream house and they're going to retire there or they're of modest means and they know they can afford it, but if they go someplace else, they can't afford it,"" he said. One homeowner whose land will be affected by the project, who did not want to be identified, said she had hoped her home ""would be a final investment for me."" ""I think about starting over when I hadn't planned on it,"" she said. If homeowners refuse to sell, the parcels may go into eminent domain disputes that can take years to resolve. But Mortell said the state can acquire the remaining properties quickly using a fast-track settlement, purchasing the properties at their appraised value and negotiating with the homeowner about a buyout price at a later date. Heard ""probably misinterpreted what shovel-ready means,"" Mortell said. He said the bridge has already been designed and all federally required studies have been completed, so work on some parts of the project can begin right away. ""Shovel-ready means that the project can move forward within 120 days, and that was a primary criteria in the stimulus plan,"" he said. Florida lawmakers approved the project for stimulus funding in April. Once the check arrives, construction will begin. But Heard said local communities should have had more of a say in the decision. ""I don't think that's fair,"" Heard said. ""I think we could actually have gotten federal stimulus dollars for projects that we all support and are necessary here.""","Proposed $128 million Indian Street Bridge has been debated for 20 years .

"(CNN) -- A Maryland woman involved with a group described as a religious cult pleaded guilty in the starvation death of her son, but insisted that the charges be dropped when he is resurrected. Under terms of her plea agreement, Ria Ramkissoon's charges will be dropped if her son rises from the dead. The condition was made a part of Ria Ramkissoon's plea agreement, officials said. She entered the plea Monday in Baltimore, Maryland, to a first-degree felony count of child abuse resulting in death, her attorney, Steven Silverman, said Tuesday. Ramkissoon, a member of a group called One Mind Ministries, believes Javon Thompson, her year-old son, will rise again, and as part of her plea agreement, authorities agreed to the clause. ""She certainly recognizes that her omissions caused the death of her son,"" Silverman said. ""To this day, she believes it was God's will and he will be resurrected and this will all take care of itself. She realizes if she's wrong, then everyone has to take responsibility ... and if she's wrong, then she's a failure as a mother and the worst thing imaginable has happened. I don't think that, mentally, she's ready to accept that."" Under the plea agreement, Ramkissoon, 22, must testify against four other One Mind Ministries members who are also facing charges, including first-degree murder, in Javon's death. At her sentencing, set for August, she will receive a 20-year sentence, which will be suspended except for the time she has already served behind bars, Silverman said. She must also undergo deprogramming and psychiatric counseling. In court Monday, it was clarified that the ""resurrection clause"" would apply only in the case of Javon's actual resurrection -- not a perceived reincarnation, Silverman said. ""This has never come up in the history of American law, as far as I've seen,"" Silverman said, adding that the clause was ""very important to her."" ""On one level, she certainly is competent to stand trial, because she does recognize that as far as her legal entanglements are concerned, this is a grand-slam resolution for her,"" Silverman said. ""On the other hand, she's still brainwashed, she's still delusional as far as the teachings and influence of this cult, and she certainly is going to benefit with professional help and deprogramming."" Ramkissoon and the others are accused of denying Javon food after the group's leader, a 40-year-old woman who goes by the name Queen Antoinette, decreed the boy was a demon since he refused to say ""amen"" after meals, Silverman said. ""Ria would cling to him every day and try to get him to say 'amen,' "" Silverman said. Eventually, Queen Antoinette ordered that Ramkissoon be separated from the child, he said. Javon is believed to have died in December 2006, court documents allege. Following his death, the group members put the boy's body in a back room, and ""everyone was directed to come in and pray,"" according to the documents. ""The Queen told everyone that 'God was going to raise Javon from the dead.' Javon remained in the room for an extended period of time (in excess of one week). The resurrection never took place."" Authorities believe the boy's body was then placed into a wheeled suitcase along with mothballs and fabric-softener sheets, documents said. Prosecutors allege Antoinette opened the suitcase periodically and sprayed its interior with Lysol to mask the decomposition odor. The group then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and befriended a man who agreed to take care of their luggage before they left, documents said. The body was found in April 2008, still inside the suitcase, in the man's storage shed. All five One Mind Ministries members were set to stand trial Monday. The case against the others has been postponed, Silverman said, as Antoinette and another woman lack attorneys and must either obtain one or waive their right to counsel. Silverman added that Antoinette has suggested, though not said outright, that God is representing her. Court documents say Ramkissoon joined One Mind Ministries after Javon's birth in 2005. Silverman described her as a petite, soft-spoken woman who rejected her family's Hindu religion, became a devout Christian and wanted to raise her son in that religion. ""She didn't want to have to work or go to school. She just wanted to take care of her son, and they offered her all this,"" he said. The group insisted she wear a uniform the colors of royalty: white, tan and blue; give up her cell phone; stop referring to her family members by name; and not leave her home on her own, among other things, he said. ""They really isolated her, brainwashed her, and you see what happened."" Ramkissoon's mother, Seeta Khadan Newton, notified various agencies that her grandson was missing after she traveled to New York City in February 2008 to find her daughter, court documents said. Newton told authorities that when she spoke to Ramkissoon and asked about Javon, her daughter replied, ""He's gone. He's lost,"" but gave no further information. Silverman said he realized right away after consulting with Ramkissoon that he needed to communicate her story to the public and to prosecutors. ""Once you get to understanding the story, understanding what Ria went through, and her intentions ... it becomes quite clear that Ria, although many may not think her hands are clean, a reasonable, rational person would have some sympathy.""","Javon Thompson is believed to have died in December 2006 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- He is the international superstar responsible for breathing life into the iconic comic book hero Wolverine. Her movies have earned more than $2 billion worldwide, including the entire ""X-Men"" franchise. Hugh Jackman emerges as Wolverine in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which opened Friday. Actor Hugh Jackman and film producer Lauren Shuler Donner recently sat down for a candid conversation about their new film, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" Specifically, the pair talked about the scene in which Jackman's character is transformed from a simple mutant with bony claws that periodically protrude from the back of his hands to an invincible mutant filled with an indestructible metal called adamantium. This scene represents the ultimate birth of a comic legend as the character is transformed from Logan to Wolverine.  Watch the scene in which Wolverine is unleashed » . Hugh Jackman: I knew this was the birth of the character; this is where we see him in full flight. It's called in the comic book ""berserker rage."" It's not really in the English language, but it may be now! But, this idea that this complete animal [has been] unleashed, which is obviously the entire story -- this battle between the animal and human is something we all relate to. Lauren Shuler Donner: There were many things he had to do in the tank, you know. One of them was he had to be lowered, and then the needles had to come towards him. Now, most of those were CGI, so he had to look in certain places where the needles were. But, he couldn't hear [director] Gavin [Hood]. So they ... tried all kinds of sounds, speakers, everything. ... They finally devised this toe method where, if Gavin pulled on Hugh's big toe, it meant the things are coming, the second toe is this, the last toe is rise up, very sophisticated. (laughter) Jackman: I had in my head that I've got to be in much better shape -- not better shape, different shape, kind of ridiculous shape because I wanted it to be uncomfortable. I wanted it to feel like I felt when I saw Robert De Niro in ""Cape Fear,"" that -- whoa, this guy is dangerous, he's powerful, he's dangerous, and he can snap at any point. Donner: There's an iconic drawing of Wolverine coming out of the tank in the comics with the things popping out of him and his hair all over him in a rage, and we wanted to be that image. That's the image we wanted for the fans. Jackman: I was a little frightened when I watched it, like, ""Is that me?"" [My wife] Deb was like, ""Hugh, this is ridiculous.

"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao has told CNN even he was surprised at how quickly his fight against Great Britain's Ricky Hatton came to an end. Manny Pacquiao throws a left hand on his way to a devastating victory over Ricky Hatton. Pacquiao, often considered the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world, cemented his reputation Saturday night when he knocked out Hatton in the second round. ""That was two of the most exciting rounds I have seen in my career,"" said Chris Mannix, a writer for Sports Illustrated. ""You saw, from the opening bell, Pacquiao was really dominant."" In an interview with CNN's Kristie LuStout after the fight, Pacquiao acknowledged the fight ended sooner than he expected.  Watch Pacquiao talk about his post-fight plans » . With the win at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas, Nevada, Pacquiao added the light-welterweight crown to his past world titles: lightweight, super-featherweight, light-featherweight, featherweight and flyweight. The Filipino's career record now stands at 49-3-2 with 37 knockouts. The fight, for which Pacquiao reportedly earned $12 million, was brief. Pacquiao knocked Hatton down in the first round from a series of lightning-fast right hooks. The British boxer managed to get to his feet and finish the round, but the outcome was evident once the second round began. Hatton, the International Boxing Organization's light-welterweight champion, tried the classic brawling style that has fueled his career. But Pacquiao's technique and speed quickly outclassed Hatton. The Filipino's right hooks set up a devastating left hook that flattened Hatton with a second remaining in the second round. The referee quickly ended the match. ""It turned out he (Hatton) just wasn't very good at boxing,"" Mannix said. ""You saw the difference between a great fighter and very good fighter."" The 30-year-old Pacquiao is a national hero in the Philippines, where his bouts bring the country to a standstill. He came into the fight on Saturday as a narrow favorite after sending one of the biggest names in the sport, Oscar de la Hoya, into retirement with a stoppage victory in December. Nicknamed ""Pacman,"" he grew up poor in General Santos City in the southern Philippines. He found boxing as a way to lift himself to fame and riches, yet he remains self-deprecating outside of the ring. It is this combination of a fierce fighter in the ring and a smiling deferential one outside that has helped turn him into an idol.
