"(CNN) -- When asked if I miss being in government, I usually try to lighten the moment by responding that I awake most days, read the paper, and then observe that, ""It's yet another great day to be the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency."" Of course, this casual answer is designed to limit comment on the things I miss (largely the mission and the people) and especially the things I don't (a longer list). But lately my half-flippant answer seems a little more true than I ever wanted it to be. And its somber implications apply not just to the director of CIA but to other senior intelligence officials as well. These jobs have always been hard. While I was at Langley, a prominent American (not in government, but very accustomed to calculating risk) once asked me, ""On a scale of zero to 10, how would you rate CIA analysis?"" I began my answer on CIA analysis--and by extension on the entire American intelligence enterprise--by noting that ""eight, nine and 10 are not on our scale. If you can get to those numbers, nobody is asking us those questions."" Using a baseball metaphor, I concluded that ""all the pitches we see seem to be hard sliders on the outside corner at the knees."" That's hard enough, but today the intelligence community seems unduly burdened with questions beyond this permanent, almost existential, dilemma. Take Benghazi, for example. Some have described what happened before the attack in which a U. S. ambassador and three other Americans died as an intelligence failure. Really? If someone needed more information to know that security there had deteriorated beyond the point of safety, they weren't waiting for warning -- they were waiting for someone to die. Good people made bad decisions, but it wasn't because they were unaware of the situation on the ground. Then there is the aftermath of Benghazi: What did we know, when did we know it and how did the administration choose to express it? The intelligence community is still living with the consequences of what could be described as a public debate badly crossing the wires of political speech with those of analytic thought. An intelligence analyst may attribute an attack to al Qaeda, whereas a policy maker could opt for the more general ""extremist."" It's still not clear what happened in this case (or why) and both speakers could technically be correct, but it is never a good thing for the analyst to be drawn into a debate to explain or justify the word choices of the politician. Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper's office seemed forced to do just that in late September. Surely what happened before and after those fateful hours in Benghazi is of national importance and our political processes need to adjudicate these questions. But at their heart these are now more political and policy debates than intelligence issues. Then there's this movie, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Some have complained that too many ""secrets"" were dished out by the intelligence and special operations communities to director Kathryn Bigelow, screenwriter Mark Boal and their crew, part of a broader pattern of using intelligence for political effect. There are now reports that one of the intelligence community's stars, Under Secretary of Defense Mike Vickers, may have leaned too far forward in talking to the film's creators. I doubt it. But I am glad that someone took the trouble to chronicle an American intelligence success. But even that narrative is controversial. So controversial in fact that acting CIA Director Michael Morell felt compelled to issue a note to his workforce last week reminding them that the movie was a work of fiction, not a documentary. And three members of the Senate are on record demanding that Sony Pictures issue a disclaimer on the role of CIA enhanced interrogations in the hunt for bin Laden. Here's what I know about the film's controversial aspects: The scenes of CIA interrogation are overwrought and inaccurate; more than detainee-derived data was key in getting to Abbottabad; and the film's star, ""Maya"", was not alone in urging the agency to move. But as often happens in art, each of these story lines has a thread of truth. CIA interrogations of more than 30 detainees were tough; the agency did derive significant intelligence from them; and ""Maya"" was a real heroine. At the end of the day, though, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a movie. Made by Hollywood. To be dramatic. That this is being debated and that intelligence leaders are being drawn into that debate is as revealing as it should be troubling. When I was at CIA I asked my civilian advisory board to tackle some tough questions. Among the toughest: In a political culture that every day demands more transparency and more public accountability from every aspect of national life, could American intelligence continue to survive and succeed? That jury is still out. One hopes that in the new year our intelligence professionals--from seniors like Clapper, Morell and Vickers to the newest arriving analyst--can disentangle themselves from these public disputes and focus on their core responsibilities. Responsibilities like gauging the spread of al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa, helping decision makers judge whether the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is a bridge or a barrier to Islamist fanaticism, identifying what part (if any) of the Syrian opposition can be trusted, or giving all of us confidence that we can detect an Iranian nuclear breakout before it is too late. Working on that stuff actually constitutes the definition of a ""great day."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael V. Hayden.","Hayden: Controversy unfairly surrounds intelligence officials' roles in two Washington issues .

"(CNN) -- He provided the sense of dread to Martin Sheen's journey upriver in ""Apocalypse Now,"" but for musician and ""soundscape ecologist"" Bernie Krause the authentic sound of the wild can be more disturbing than any synthesized film score. ""I'm not a very religious person but the living world is speaking to us in very profound ways and it's telling us we'd better pay some attention,"" he said, speaking from his home in California. For 44 years Krause has traveled across the globe recording the sounds of the natural world and has amassed an archive of more the 4,500 hours and over 15,000 individual creatures. But perhaps the most remarkable part of Krause's back catalog of nature's orchestra is that that around 50% comes from now silent or extinct habitats. ""I believe that we're in danger of losing this important part of our lives very quickly,"" he said. Crouching in a pitch-black jungle while a jaguar growls nearby or recording the sound of ants ""singing"" is a long way from Krause's early career as a musician. Part of the 1960s folk quartet ""The Weavers,"" he then became one of the first musicians to use a Moog and experiment with synthesizers. It was when recording natural sound with his musical partner Paul Beaver for 1970 album ""In a Wild Sanctuary"" that he had his acoustic epiphany. ""My parents hated nature, they considered a bonefish dangerous. We had no animals in the house when I was growing up and I really missed that. Going out in the field (to record 'In a Wild Sanctuary') I realized at 30 years old how much I had missed,"" he said. ""I decided right then and there it would be a life-changing event. Little by little I spent more time in the field recording."" While continuing other work, including writing books and the film scores for ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Performance,"" and Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic, Krause ventured into pristine landscapes across the world. Yet it was not until a 1983 trip to Kenya that he developed a theory to match his endeavors. ""I discovered that the voices coming from only animals was very much like music. I realized that when all of these critter found these niches, a bandwidth so that all their voices can be heard -- just like instruments in an orchestra -- that a habitat was healthy,"" he said. 100 most endangered animals named in report . This ""biophony,"" as Krause calls it, can be studied as a marker of an eco-system's health. While some in the scientific community remain skeptical of Krause's ideas, they have been adopted by university courses in the U.S., and aided the study of ecology. Now in his 70s, Krause is resolved to keep up his field work, if need be by capturing soundscapes with digital recorders tucked into his pockets or tiny mics attached to his shoulders to avoid arousing unwanted attention. From noises that inspire primal fear to fascination, what he hears never fails to surprise and intrigue him. ""The most remarkable thing is the smaller critters, like sea anemones making noise, even viruses have a sound. Every living organism creates an acoustic signature that makes it unique and special,"" he said. ""A coral reef that is alive has many different sounds, each fish species has their own signature, some gnaw on coral, others make noise with their swim bladders. A living reef is filled with all kinds of racket going on, whereas a reef under stress, dying or dead has almost no sound apart from the lapping of the waves above."" Pacific nations create largest marine park . This quieting of nature is not only alarming for the natural world but unhealthy for humans, too, believes Krause. ""The (loss of forests) on people (who live there) is profound. There's an element of stress that has been introduced into their lives, because they can no longer hear the voices that are narrative of place, part of their spiritual and cultural roots. When these place disappear it's like they lose part of their home. ""The further we (as the human race) grow away from the natural world, the quieter the natural world becomes and the more pathological we become as a culture.""","Krause has recorded more than 4,500 hours of the sounds of the natural world .
More than 50% of his archive comes from places that no longer exist in the same form .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration is urging anyone who has used any product by the New England Compounding Center to be vigilant for signs of meningitis, such as a headache or stiff neck. At least 233 people have become ill after receiving steroid injections made by the compounding center for back, neck and joint pain. Fifteen of those sickened have died. On Monday, the FDA announced that two more patients were sickened after other products made at the compounding center were used in heart and eye surgery. But there's one problem for patients trying to take a proactive role in their health: The New England Compounding Center was making more than 2,400 drugs and other products, and many patients would never know whether they received them. The list of New England Compounding Center products (PDF) takes up more than 70 pages and includes many hospital staples, such as morphine and saline, which are often used in surgery when the patient would have been asleep. ""It would be very difficult for a patient to sort this out,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a consultant to the Tennessee Department of Health. Even doctors would have a hard time knowing whether they used a New England Compounding Center product on patients without doing an extensive search through patient records. The FDA warning applies to products made at the compounding center after May 21. The FDA doesn't know how many people have received such products since that date, said FDA spokeswoman Sarah Clark-Lynn. ""We understand that this is scary,"" Clark-Lynn said. Meningitis blamed for judge's death . The FDA has not released a list of hospitals and doctors who've received New England Compounding Center products. Without that information, Schaffner said, it's impossible for doctors to warn patients who might have been infected. ""It's puzzling the FDA hasn't done that,"" he said. He said it would be especially important to have a distribution list for the second steroid and the heart surgery drug, since those might be linked to new infections. ""We want to get information out to patients and alert them,"" he said. ""But without more specific information and lot numbers, this FDA announcement isn't operationable."" Clark-Lynn said the FDA is working on it. ""This is an ongoing investigation, and we're moving very quickly,"" she said. ""We just don't have all the answers yet.""

"(CNN) -- Since leaving government almost a decade ago, my analysis of matters Middle Eastern has been, well, annoyingly negative. And the reason? Best summed up in a line often attributed to Groucho Marx but actually uttered by Chico: ""Well, who are you gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"" What I see is an angry, broken, dysfunctional region that wants to transcend itself and resolve the conflicts that hold it back, but just can't. And I'm not at all sure there's a whole lot America -- that indispensable nation -- can do about it. Here are my predictions for 2013 on some of the key issues. This year's theme is muddle through --neither breakthroughs nor breakdowns. Iran: . 2013 -- The so-called year of decision -- war with the mullahs who rule Iran or the grand bargain -- will produce neither. President Obama will go to extreme lengths to avoid a military strike aimed at Iran's nuclear program and will not greenlight an Israeli one. Without that go-ahead, the Israelis will continue to agonize but not act. And the mullahs will be smart enough not to brazenly give either Jerusalem or Washington an easy excuse to strike. Bottom line -- 2013 will be a year of diplomacy, not war. To borrow a conceit from my friend New York Times reporter Elaine Sciolino, 2013 will witness the Tom and Jerry game in which cat and mouse in the old cartoon continue a never-ending game of almost gotcha. Who knows? If the Americans and Iranians try hard enough they might actually bump into one another and reach a limited deal to keep Iran a few more years away from getting enough uranium to make weapons. But if you're looking for final closure on this one, go talk to Dr. Phil. Arab-Israeli peace: . The sun, moon, and stars really aren't aligned on this one for a big breakthrough. Where should I start? The January 22 elections in Israel will likely produce another Netanyahu government that has no incentive to destroy itself politically by tackling the big issues like Jerusalem and refugees, certainly not with the Iranian nuclear issue still open. And the Islamists -- Hamas and Egypt's Mohamed Morsy (who can barely bring himself to talk about a two-state solution) aren't in the giving mood either. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is too weak to initiate much. Bottom line -- The Americans will try and may succeed in getting the Israelis and Palestinians into a process to talk about borders and security. But the two-state solution is likely to remain too hard to achieve but too important to abandon. Persident Obama will probably not be earning his Nobel peace prize -- yet. Arab spring/winter: . This is going to be a long movie. After all, it took the United States a century and half and bloody civil war to even begin to reconcile the promise of equality contained wiithin the Declaration of Independence with the legitimization of slavery contained in the Constitution, and we're still not there yet. Still, nowhere in the Arab world do the trend lines look that hopeful. Neither in Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya, let alone Syria, do the Arabs have the three elements required to set their experiment with democratization and pluralism in the right direction: leaders who put the nation before their own political and religious parties' interests, institutions that are seen as inclusive and legitimate, and a mechanism to ensure that polarization doesn't spill out into the streets in violence. Bottom line -- Buckle your seatbelts. No immediate convulsions and catastrophes. But in the new Arab world with Islamists rising, the political space for the United States is going to get a whole lot smaller and the dangers to our diplomats much greater. The key question is at what point the bell will begin to toll for the kings and emirs in Jordan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, too. The good news: . But all isn't totally gloomy. We're out of or getting out of the two longest wars in our history, we're reducing our dependence on Arab oil, al Qaeda has been weakened, and while we're not safe we're certainly safer here at home -- at least from foreign terrorists. Bottom line -- With the notable exception of killing Osama bin Laden, President Obama hasn't had any spectacular successes in foreign policy, but more important, he has avoided spectacular failures. If he can continue to keep us out of trouble, particularly at a time when we need to be focused on repairing America's broken house rather than chasing around the lands of Araby trying to fix everybody else's, he'll have done pretty well. And who knows, if he's patient, maybe he'll even be able to turn one of those Middle Eastern migraines and root canals into an opportunity or two.

"(CNN) -- In Saudi Arabia today perhaps the biggest factor fuelling inflation is the influx of money from oil. The kingdom is the world's top oil producer -- making an estimated $2 billion from oil exports last year. Abdulkarim Abu Al Nasr CEO of NCB, the region's biggest bank . John Defterios (JD) sits down with Abdulkarim Abu Al Nasr (AN), CEO of NCB, the region's biggest bank and begins by asking him how Saudi Arabia can help the lowest levels of society to benefit from the record oil prices. (AN): I think the government has to change its role from a business owner to a business enabler by privatizing, by putting a foundation of the legal infrastructure, the encouragement and incentives. The business community has to step up to the challenge and I think that private business has to act in different capacities. In the role of a full partner, in the role of entrepreneur and job creator because this time around the private sector has to play the role hand in hand with the government rather than depending on the government to be the only solution to economic and development needs. (JD): From your vantage point how is this economic undertaking different to what it was thirty years ago? (AN): I think there are a couple of faults that come from this point. First of all, in the first boom the government was the engine of growth for the economy. There was very little of the private sector. This time around the private sector is alive and well and is participating very much. I think this time around the boom is also accompanied by a strong reform agenda. Last time, it wasn't. It was just merely a spending on infrastructure and projects. (JD): Do you see, in the near future, outright sales to the major international banks, like HSBC or Citigroup or Barclays who have a lot of experience in emerging markets? (AN): I think that the regulators are going to look for quality players to come to the market. I think that is very much welcomed and sought after because they bring with them capabilities and expertise. I think the issue of selling the banks to these players is a matter of valuations and a matter of desire from the owners. Let's keep in mind that a lot of these banks are still owned by families and by certain groups. Its not easy to go out and buy a large chunk of financial services out of the stock market. (JD): What does this mean for the future, a mini form of protectionism? (AN): I don't think protectionism is the real word because we already are seeing the transformation and already the liberalization of the sector. I think it's just the identification of acquisition targets and then the desire of the owners, to actually surrender control and take advantage of the valuations. (JD): Within the emergence now in the region, you see not one financial centre but four or five of them. Saudi Arabia has its own designs, Bahrain, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and, of course, Dubai. Is this going to lead to an acute shortage of trained people to fill the jobs and how much of an urgency is that today? (AN): I think it's going to be a challenge. I think the idea of having regional financial centers is not absurd. I think the level of wealth building that is taking place in the region encourages the creation of financial centers to effectively and efficiently mediate and allow players to come together to do that. I think also there are different players for example the financial centre in Saudi Arabia is predominantly bringing financial intermediaries together in a compound. Not necessarily to create a different regulatory environment. It is a different play than for example the one in Dubai or in Qatar. I think the challenge on human capital is real and we are competing against the best resources around the world with everybody else.

"Cupertino, California (CNN) -- Apple on Tuesday unveiled the iPhone 4S, a faster version of its best-selling smartphone that includes a virtual ""personal assistant"" you can talk to. ""When you think about it, only Apple could make such amazing software, hardware and services and bring them together into such a powerful yet integrated experience,"" the company's new CEO Tim Cook said at a press conference Tuesday at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California. The next-generation iPhone also will be available on Sprint's wireless network for the first time, in addition to AT&T and Verizon. A model with 16 GB of storage starts at $200 with a two-year wireless contract; the 64 GB model costs $400. An online presale for the phone begins on Friday, and the phone will become available in stores on October 14. Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who recently resigned as CEO amid health concerns, did not take the stage at the press conference and was not seen by CNN reporters at the event. The iPhone 4S looks identical to a previous model, but it contains an A5 processor that the company says is up to seven times faster at rendering graphics and twice as fast at processing data. It has a personal assistant called ""Siri,"" which takes voice commands and can translate speech into text. Siri also talks back, answering questions and reading calendar events and updates. ""I've been in the AI (artificial intelligence) field a long time. This blows me away,"" Apple's Scott Forstall, a senior vice president for iPhone software, said after he announced the new service, which only works on the iPhone 4S, not on previous models. In a demo, Forstall asked the phone to ""find me a Greek restaurant in Palo Alto."" The phone pulled up restaurants from the app Yelp and said: ""I have found 14 Greek restaurants; five of them are in Palo Alto. I have listed them according to ranking."" Some people who followed the event online joked that Siri reminded them of the computer HAL from the movie, ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" ""We are clearly headed to Terminator/HAL territory here. Humans are doomed. Deal with it,"" wrote Sam Grobart on the New York Times' live blog of the press conference. The voice feature also pulls data from Wikipedia and search engine WolframAlpha, among other information services. The iPhone 4S is also a ""world phone,"" meaning it will be able to place calls more easily on wireless networks all over the world, not just in the United States. Among the other updates: . -- The phone also has ""fantastic battery life,"" allowing people to talk for eight hours before needing to charge it again, said Phil Schiller, Apple's vice-president for product marketing. -- It features an 8-megapixel camera with a better light sensor, making it as good or better than many point-and-shoot devices. -- It will shoot high-definition video, and it has a new image stabilization feature to make YouTube videos less shaky. Despite some new features, however, some market analysts were disappointed that Apple did not release a more radically designed version of its smartphone, as CNNMoney reports. Apple's shares sagged slightly for the day on news of the phone's update. At the event on Tuesday, Apple also announced updates to its mobile operating system, called iOS5, which will be available for free on October 12. The new version of the operating system works on the iPhone 4 and 3GS, as well as both versions of the iPad and the iPod Touch. The iOS 5 system includes several new features, including a cloud service that will sync some photos and files from the iPhone onto Internet servers. A product called iTunes Match will sync music from the iPhone with a database in the cloud, making it possible to play your music on any device or computer instead of just on the one where you purchased it. The iTunes Match product will be available later this month, the company said, and costs $25 per year. A new app called Cards will let iPhone owners send paper greeting cards to people for a fee that includes postage. And, finally, a new social networking app called Find My Friends lets users share their current location with close contacts. In all, Apple says it has sold 250 million gadgets that run on its mobile operating system. The company finds itself as the top mobile gadget maker. The iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS were the best-selling smartphone models in the United States in the second quarter of this fiscal year, according to data from the NPD Group. Apple says it sold more than 20 million iPhones in the last financial quarter alone, up 142% from that same period of time in 2010. Cook on Tuesday said the iPhone is the bestselling phone in the world. We'll have to wait a few weeks to see how well the iPhone 4S continues that success.","Apple iPhone 4S is faster than previous versions .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military could provide logistical and intelligence support in the French effort against Islamist rebels in Mali, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday. Conflict explained: What's behind the instability in Mali? The U.S. will ""provide whatever assistance it can"" as part of what Panetta said was the U.S. global efforts against al Qaeda. ""We have a responsibility to go after al Qaeda wherever they are. And we've gone after them in the FATA (Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas). We're going after them in Yemen and Somalia. And we have a responsibility to make sure that al Qaeda does not establish a base for operations in North Africa and Mali,"" Panetta told reporters traveling with him to Europe. The State Department said Monday the United States is in consultation with the French now on a number of requests that they have made for support. French defense minister: Islamist rebels gaining ground in Mali . ""We are reviewing the requests that they have made,"" spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Monday.

In addition, the Pentagon is considering sending refueling tankers so that French jets can fly longer, more sustained combat mission, according to the officials. Drones ""are under consideration,"" according to defense officials, though the military's stash of unmanned aerial vehicles are in heavy demand. ""That's one of the things we're working through now, is how many and from where we'd be able to provide those assets,"" said one of the officials, noting that drones are being used in other conflict areas such as Afghanistan and Yemen. Although both caveat that these would be surveillance drones and said there are no plans yet to deploy armed unmanned aerial vehicles. Read more: France determined to 'eradicate' terrorism in Mali . The officials also say another intelligence-gathering assets under consideration are piloted planes. ""There's no real air defenses to speak of in Mali, outside of AQIM firing guns in the air.

The US also considering giving ""airlift capacity"" to the effort, similar to what the British have provided in two cargo planes, according to the officials. This ""would help the French with moving equipment, vehicles and people"" to where they're needed in Mali, the officials said. Panetta said al Qaeda's Mali affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, is not an immediate threat to the U.S. homeland but does pose a risk if it gains a foothold. U.S. officials have said the group was tied to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. ""While they might not have any immediate plans for attacks in the United States and in Europe, that ultimately still remains their objective and it's for that reason that we have to take steps now to ensure that AQIM does not get that kind of traction,"" Panetta said, according to a transcript of Panetta's remarks to reporters.

"New York (CNN) -- Did the Chinese government announce earlier this week that it would end its notorious detention system known as Re-Education Through Labor (RTL)? On January 7, Meng Jianzhu, the head of the powerful Political and Legal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, reportedly announced that the government would ""stop using"" the system, in which roughly 160,000 people are detained for up to four years without trial for ""crimes that are not severe enough to warrant a criminal sentence,"" by the end of 2013. After media outlets confirmed the news with officials who attended the meeting Meng spoke at, the original articles reporting the decision vanished from the Internet. A subsequent Xinhua news story watered down Meng's statement, committing the government only to ""advancing reforms"" of RTL -- which is old news -- a long-stated but never-implemented goal. This episode highlights three realities of China's human rights situation: 1) the news is often not what it initially appears to be, especially if a key government decision is at stake; 2) the new leadership is struggling to reply adequately to growing popular demand for reform; and 3) changes to RTL, like other long-mooted reforms, might only be a cosmetic gesture, leaving intact laws and practices that violate domestic and international human rights standards. China's new leaders have come to power during a serious legitimacy crisis, with a nation eager for political reforms. Indeed, party chief Xi Jinping has repeatedly vowed to ""deepen reform."" At the same time, there has been rising public discontent over local officials' abuse of RTL to muzzle ordinary people seeking justice or criticizing the government. The system was further discredited by the recent detentions of Tang Hui, a mother seeking redress for the rape of her young daughter, and Ren Jianyu, a village official who posted negative comments online about the government. Meanwhile, the main obstacle to abolishing RTL, the Ministry of Public Security, which holds the unchecked power to detain individuals in these facilities, has seen its political clout diminished under the new leadership arrangement. The time for abolition of RTL appears ripe, but it's unclear whether Xi is ready to move from talking about reforms to delivering them. As a type of arbitrary detention, RTL should not be reformed: it should be abolished outright. The tepid Xinhua announcement promising to ""reform"" RTL suggests that instead of abolition, the government will merely tinker at the margins of the existing system. Fears this might be the case derive from the August 2012 announcement of a pilot scheme in four cities. Few details are available, except that the name of the system was revised from Re-education to ""Education and Correction,"" and minor constraints on the police's ability to impose these punishments were established. The debate in and outside of China this week echoes the 2003 debate about the abolition of ""Custody and Repatriation."" This system of administrative detention was designed to detain individuals found outside of their official location of residence (hukou). It was similarly discredited and abolished after a series of abuses, the last straw being the beating and death of a young man in a Custody and Repatriation center in Guangzhou in March 2003. The decision to get rid of the system was made at the beginning of the then-new leadership of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, and was perceived as a signal of reform. Yet the failure to match the end of Custody and Repatriation with a wholesale prohibition on arbitrary detention mitigated the benefits of its abolition. Migrant workers who had been prey for the system benefited from its abolition, but local governments soon found new ways to deal with the other category of people detained in Custody and Repatriation centers -- petitioners. Illegal and ad hoc ""black jails"" were set up to prevent them from trying to reach higher authorities to denounce local official misconduct. The central government tolerates the existence of these patently unlawful black jails, demonstrating that it continues to lack commitment to ending arbitrary detention. Swapping one system of arbitrary detention for another would be a missed opportunity for the new leadership. Real change requires that the government abolish RTL, and establish in its place a new system to punish minor crimes that is consistent with the Chinese Constitution as well as its international human rights obligations, and pass the necessary legislation during the next National People's Congress in March. The judiciary -- not the police -- should be responsible for considering charges, determining guilt, and assigning appropriate punishment. People who are accused must have the ability to confront and question their accusers, the right to counsel, and all fair trial guarantees. Anything short of this will not quench the public's thirst for the ""deepening reform."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maya Wang.","Chinese media recently said infamous 'Re-Education Through Labor' system would be reformed .

"(EW.com) -- No one knows how to make white men squirm quite like Samuel L. Jackson. A post on Reddit last night has unearthed a prime example. Two weeks ago, the ""Django Unchained"" cast sat down with Jake Hamilton, host of Houston's Emmy-winning film show Jake's Takes, at a press junket. Things went smoothly enough until Hamilton approached Jackson with a question about the movie's controversial use of the ""n-word."" Jackson insisted that Hamilton, who is white, say the word out loud; after Hamilton repeatedly refused, they moved on. It was uncomfortable. ""The most awkward moment was just seeing everyone in the room freeze, and waiting to see what my reaction was going to be,"" Hamilton says today. The internet reaction has been mixed. Many commenters claim that Hamilton should have simply said the word, while others applaud the reporter for not caving to Jackson's demand.

While it'd be easy to harbor some resentment for the provocation, Hamilton says that ultimately there's no hard feelings between him and Jackson.

"(CNN) -- A Tibetan man protesting China's rule of the region set himself on fire Saturday, his death believed to be the first case of self-immolation this year -- but one that adds to a grim, growing toll. The death took place in Gansu province in northwestern China. It was reported by Free Tibet, a London-based organization that campaigns for self-determination for Tibetans, and by the U.S.-based Radio Free Asia. Free Tibet said the man was 22, while Radio Free Asia put his age at 19. Details of the death -- as has been the case with other such incidents -- are sketchy and difficult to verify. Internet content controlled by local authorities makes reliable information almost impossible to come by. Self-immolation is a common form of protest for Tibetans, who want genuine autonomy from China and accuse Beijing of repression. China began a gradual occupation of Tibet in the 1950s. Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled for India in 1959 after a failed uprising, and many ethnic Tibetans followed him. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. It makes centuries-old historical claims on the region. Self-immolation as a form of protest by Tibetans began in February 2009, when a young monk set himself ablaze. In March 2011, another young monk followed in his footsteps, becoming the first to die. By December 2012, 95 Tibetans had carried out the act, with 28 self-immolations in November alone when China's political elite ushered in its next generation of leaders during its Communist Party Congress. At least 81 of them died, according to the International Tibet Network, a coalition of some 150 pro-Tibet groups.. In his first speech as Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping stressed the need for unity in a country where the Party was becoming too distant from the people. This followed predecessor Hu Jintao's comments to Congress delegates in November that the Party ""should consolidate and develop socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance and harmony so that all ethnic groups in China will live and develop together in harmony."" But activists warn that if the Chinese government continues to tighten its grip on the Tibetan people in the name of stability, it will only create more resentment. They point to the growing list of young victims prepared to take such extreme action, which they say reflects a desperate and painful state of mind for many.","Details of the death are sketchy .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- After eight days inspecting the Japanese company that makes the lithium ion batteries linked to problems that have led to the grounding of Boeing 787 Dreamliners around the world, aviation authorities have found no serious problems with the devices. Read more: What's wrong with the Dreamliner? U.S. and Japanese officials carried out a joint inspection at the facility in the city of Kyoto where GS Yuasa makes the batteries. While investigators found several issues in quality control at the company, they didn't uncover any serious problems that can be linked to recent incidents involving Dreamliners, Yasuo Ishii, director of air worthiness standards at the Japanese transport ministry, said Tuesday. Two recent incidents -- a fire aboard the Japan Airlines aircraft in Boston's Logan International Airport on January 7, and a smoke alarm aboard a plane flying over Japan on January 16 -- prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground all Dreamliners in the United States, and other nations quickly followed suit. Read more: Boeing keeps building Dreamliners it can't fly . The investigation has now shifted from the battery maker to the manufacturer of the system that monitors the battery's voltage and temperature, Ishii said. Officials from the FAA and the Japanese transport ministry on Monday began checking the quality control at Kanto Aircraft Instrument Co., in Kanagawa prefecture, according to Ishii. They haven't found any serious problems so far, he said. Kanto Aircraft Instrument declined to comment on the matter. Questions remain . The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last week it had determined that the lithium ion battery on the Boston aircraft experienced a ""thermal runaway"" and a ""short circuit."" Read more: Federal watchdog opens probe of Boeing Dreamliner woes . But safety investigators have not determined which event occurred first, or whether they were the cause or the effect of the incident. In a thermal runaway, a battery releases energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the battery and causing further damage. In an electrical short, electricity follows an unintended path. Neither event should have occurred on the Dreamliner, Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the NTSB, said last week. ""There are multiple systems to protect against a battery event like this,"" she said. ""Those systems did not work as intended, we need to understand why."" Experts: Quick fix for Dreamliner looks less likely . The FAA allowed Boeing to use lithium ion batteries, instead of more traditional battery chemistries, under a series of ""special conditions"" intended to address concerns about the batteries. Boeing has said its technical experts are working ""around the clock"" and are focused on ""resolving the issue"" and returning the 787 to service. Currently, there are 50 wide body Dreamliners in service globally, and several hundred on order. The 787 is highly touted because of its mostly lightweight carbon fiber construction, which airlines expect will help them save billions in fuel costs on long-haul routes. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki in Tokyo contributed to this report.","Inspectors find no serious problems at GS Yuasa, the battery maker .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- First it was the start of winter vacation. Then Christmas Eve and Christmas passed, as had Henry Cleary's eighth birthday. But finally -- after 10 days away from home, with his mother and the rest of their family unaware of where they were most of that time -- Henry and his older brother, Ben, should soon be heading back to Georgia. The two boys were found Saturday evening in Austin, Texas -- about 950 miles west of their hometown of Roswell, an Atlanta suburb -- Austin Police Lt. James Nisula told CNN. The brothers are safe. And the man who is suspected of taking them, their father Daniel Cleary, is in police custody, according to Nisula. He will be charged with interstate interference with custody, a felony, and extradited back to Georgia, according to Roswell Police Lt. James H. McGee. ""I'm ecstatic, I'm in shock,"" Theresa Nash, soon after hearing the news and getting off the phone with her boys. Her joy was a far cry from what she was feeling a few hours earlier. Nash said she didn't know why her estranged husband did not bring the boys home as planned Wednesday from a trip to Tennessee that began December 19. She told CNN affiliate WSB-TV that she had not heard from Daniel Cleary since December 22. In an emotional plea on CNN Saturday, she asked for the boys to be brought home safely. ""He's trying to take care of them,"" she said of her estranged husband. ""But I think it's a scary situation for everybody at this point."" Police first issued an Amber Alert for the suspect and his two sons on Thursday, eight days after they were last seen in Georgia. ""Suspect & children are believed to be traveling in a 2002 silver Jeep Grand Cherokee ... traveling on west side of Nashville, TN, on Interstate 40,"" the alert stated. The next day, authorities released pictures of the father and his two boys taken from surveillance cameras December 23 and December 24 at a Walmart in Jackson, Tennessee. Still, they didn't know exactly where they were. That changed Saturday, soon after Theresa Nash went on CNN, clutching Ben's beloved teddy bear and Henry's stuffed hippo as she sat beside a picture of the two boys. ""This vacation has been overdue. It's time to come home, and we welcome you home ... safely,"" she said, addressing Daniel Cleary. ""Your whole family is behind this, as is my whole family. We are working together, and we really want you to come home."" A person at the Crossland Austin West hotel in Texas had been watching CNN, recognized the Cleary brothers and called 911, said Austin police Lt. Wuthipong Tantaksinanukij. After getting that tip around 5:11 p.m. CT, officers went to the hotel and, as ""they started setting up, saw the suspect coming out of one of the rooms with the two children,"" Tantaksinanukij said. ""He was taken into custody without further incident,"" said the police spokesman, noting Daniel Cleary is now at the Williamson County Jail. Authorities looking into the case subsequently found ""a handgun -- a pistol -- and a large sum of money."" Tantaksinanukij said he didn't know why the boys and their father ended up in Austin, or how long they'd been there. But he said the case might not have been solved Saturday night without the alert citizen, as well as the Amber Alert system that publicizes news of missing and endangered children on highways, in police stations and around the United States. ""The law enforcement community nationwide, we take these Amber Alerts seriously when it deals with kids,"" Tantaksinanukij said. ""This was one of the cases where it was activated and it worked."" Around the time her estranged husband was being taken into custody, Nash said she got a call from a man who said, ""I'm sitting here with your two sons."" He then handed the phone to the boys. Unaware of the commotion, the boys said Daniel Cleary had told them their mother was in the hospital, Nash said. They talked about other things as well -- like the birthday boy Henry bragging about how he'd been kicking Ben's butt on iPad games, and Nash telling them she'd gotten the brothers an Xbox for Christmas. ""They were all joy,"" she said. For now, her boys are healthy and with police, ""doing what kids should be doing right now -- they're playing,"" said Tantaksinanukij. Nash said Saturday night that she was flying first thing to Dallas, then renting a car and driving to Austin. She doesn't know where or when she'll pick her sons up, ""but we have plenty of time to figure it out."" She thanked the media for showcasing her family's story, and was taken aback by how much things changed for her and her family in a moment's notice. ""It is amazing,"" Nash said. ""I had lost hope."" CNN's Jason Morrell and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","NEW: A person alerted police after recognizing the missing boys on CNN, police say .

"(CNN) -- A smoky fire broke out aboard an empty Japan Airlines 787 Dreamliner in Boston on Monday in the latest glitch for the much-heralded Boeing model. The Japan Airlines plane, which had arrived at Logan Airport from Tokyo at 10 a.m., was being prepared for a noon departure at a gate when a maintenance worker noticed smoke and called emergency crews. ""Upon arrival, we observed a heavy smoke condition in the entire cabin,"" said Bob Donahue, chief of the Massport Fire Rescue Department. ""We found a fire condition about midship in the avionics compartment underneath. We advanced an aggressive, offensive fire attack."" Batteries used to start the auxiliary power unit, which provides electricity for ground operations, are located in the small area in the belly of the plane. ""We did have a flare-up. There was a small explosion -- one of the batteries -- and we again went in with a secondary attack and were again able to knock it down,"" Donahue said. Japan Airlines confirmed the cause of the fire in a news release. It said 172 passengers and 11 crew members had been on the plane. Everyone had disembarked when the fire was discovered, the airline said. One firefighter had a skin irritation from the material used to put the fire out, but no one else was injured. Donahue says it's not likely this could have happened during flight when the auxiliary power unit was not in use. ""This is an extremely serious situation,"" Kevin Hiatt, a former pilot and vice president with the Flight Safety Foundation, told CNN. ""If there is any problem I think you will see something come out very shortly."" Monday's incident is not the first mechanical problem for the 787 series, which was delivered to airlines starting in 2011 after years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns. The JAL plane was delivered in December. In 2010, fire caused a 787 test flight to lose primary electrical power while flying from Yuma, Arizona, to Laredo, Texas. It landed safely using backup systems and the 42 people aboard evacuated using emergency slides. An engine failed during tests on the ground in South Carolina in July 2012 and inspectors found a similar problem on another aircraft in September. In December, another relatively new 787 operated by United Airlines diverted safely to New Orleans after experiencing mechanical problems. ""The 787, being a new airplane, does have teething problems,"" John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN. Goglia, a former airline mechanic, said it is common for new planes to have ""these kinds of problems."" While serious, Hiatt did not think these issues are a sign of larger concerns with the 787 program. ""There does not appear to be a common thread in the problems the planes have seen,"" he told CNN. ""If they had another situation, a fire, that was in that same locality you'd start to say yes, we've got something else that is going on."" Boeing said it was investigating the incident and noted it was too early to draw any parallels. ""We need to give our technical teams time to really understand the event,"" Lori Gunter, spokeswoman for the 787 program, said in a statement. ""Anything offered now would be speculation and likely incorrect. It's just too early to make comparisons to other events or to draw conclusions."" The NTSB sent a team to investigate the incident. ""It's one of our 'most wanted list' issues, fire in transportation,"" Eric Weiss, a board spokesman, said. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","Firefighters battle smoke in cabin of Japan Airlines jet in Boston .

"(CNN) -- The release of the first half of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit elicited waves of joy Tuesday from relatives of the prisoners. In Israel, where the soldier's homecoming was greeted with celebration, the deal enjoys widespread support. But many Israelis are asking why so many prisoners, many with violent pasts, should be freed. One minister who voted against the agreement called it ""a great victory for terrorism,"" and there are fears among Israelis that the release of convicted murderers will lead to further attacks on Israeli civilians. So who are the most controversial prisoners being freed? Yihia Al-Sinwar: Was serving four life sentences for his role in the kidnapping and murder of Sgt. Nachshon Wachsman in 1994. Al-Sinwar's brother Mohammed was reportedly involved in the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit, and was a founding member of Hamas's military structure in Gaza. Muhammad al-Sharatha: Was serving three life sentences for his involvement in the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers, Sgt. Avi Sasportas and Cpl. Ilan Saadon. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Sasportas was kidnapped on Feb. 16, 1989 and shot dead. His body was found in May 1989. Saadon was abducted on May 3, 1989, his body was discovered in 1996. Both cases were also associated with senior Hamas militant Mahmoud al-Mabhouh assassinated in Dubai in May last year. Ahlam Tamimi: Was serving life terms for being an accomplice in the 2001 bombing of the Sbarro pizzeria restaurant, killing 15 Israelis. Amneh Muna: Plotted the killing of a 16-year-old Israeli boy Ofir Rahum in 2001 by luring him into the West Bank over the internet, was serving life in prison. Nasser Yataima: Was convicted of planning the 2002 Passover Seder suicide-bomb attack on the Park Hotel in Netanya, killing 30 civilians and wounding 140. Husam Badran: Reported to be involved in the planning of the 2001 bombing of a Tel Aviv nightclub in which 21 youths were murdered, the Park Hotel bombing, and the 2002 bombing of a restaurant in Haifa, in which 14 civilians lost their lives. The most notable name not on the list is that of jailed Palestinian lawmaker Marwan Barghouti, who is serving five life sentences for murder and other charges related to his role in planning attacks on Israelis during the second Intifada. He had been considered by many Palestinians the most important prisoner who might have been released in exchange for Shalit.","Release of Palestinian prisoners in swap for Israeli soldier elicits joy from relatives .

"(InStyle.com) -- Here are some simple and easy tips to turn back the clock. 1. Brighten up with concealer . Why stop at undereye circles? Dab it on the inner and outer corners of eyes, the outer sides of nostrils, and either end of the lips and -- bam! --everything will suddenly lift up. Says New York makeup artist Mally Roncal, ""People will start asking who your surgeon is."" 2. Be careful with color . Leave the hair extremes to Lady Gaga. ""If you over-highlight your blond hair, you lose the golden tones that keep it looking youthful and pretty,"" says New York colorist Louis Licari. ""And hair that is dyed too dark is unnatural."" 3. Perk up a saggy butt . The hollows of our cheeks aren't the only places that succumb to gravity as we age: Our bottoms tend to be less buoyant too. To give them a lift, Susie Crippen of J Brand recommends checking the label of every pair of jeans before buying. ""Make sure they have at least 2 percent stretch, like Lycra,"" she says. ""Pants with more than 98 percent cotton can stretch out as soon as you wear them and give no support."" 4. Shine on . Years of blow-drying and styling take a toll on hair, leaving it lackluster. Restore the healthy shine with a clear, conditioning gloss (you can do it at home with Fekkai's). For everyday sparkle, apply a shine serum (try Redken Color Extend Shine Enrich serum). 5. Find the perfect bra . Get a professional bra fitting, and don't get hung up on the numbers (or letters). ""A good bra elevates your chest to a higher altitude, giving you a longer, slimmer-looking waist, both of which read younger,"" says New York stylist Annabel Tollman. 6. Give some lip service . It's undeniable: Even the juiciest lips lose volume as we get older. Dark, matte lipsticks only accentuate that fact. Switch to pink gloss the brighter color makes your kisser appear fuller, younger and smoother. 7. Fake an eye lift . To correct a droopy upper eyelid, New York makeup artist Paula Dorf recommends artful contouring. Use a light-colored shadow near the lash line and a deeper shade in an arc above the crease where the lid is dropping. ""The lighter shade makes the bottom of the lid more visible, while the darker shade makes the puffy top part recede,"" says Dorf. The result? A more wide-eyed, youthful look. 8. Get a little cheeky . ""As we age the fat pads in our cheeks fall,"" explains Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Gabriel Chiu. But you can defy nature: Prevelle Silk, a new hyaluronic acid dermal filler ($250--$400 per syringe) ""lasts for three months, and you can see the skin-plumping effects right away."" Searching for something subtler? A bright pink blush has a similar payoff, illuminating the cheekbone and drawing the eye upward. 9. Lose the powder makeup . Dry makeup makes skin look crêpey and old, says Dorf. As you get older and your skin produces less oil, dewy makeup is more flattering. Consider switching to a lightweight tinted moisturizer with luminizing effects (we love By Terry's new formula) and cream versions of blush and bronzer. And don't forget highlighter: A few drops of well-placed shimmer on cheekbones are the makeup equivalent of good lighting. 10. Mix things up . Matchy-matchy style isn't modern -- at any age. ""Always throw in something unexpected, like messy hair, a casual jacket, or flats with a fancy dress,"" says Annabel Tollman. ""It will energize your look by a decade.""

"(CNN) -- A bored U.S. marshal using Google connected an alleged scam artist arrested this year under an alias to a lawyer who disappeared decades ago before he was indicted on federal fraud charges. The suspect in a fake charity scam that stole millions in donations intended for Navy veterans is also wanted by the FBI for questioning in a spy case, federal officials said. When U.S. marshals arrested ""Bobby Thompson"" five months ago, they said they knew he was using a fake name. He's been held in the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, jail since then. ""We always knew there was a reason that 'Thompson' signed his name as 'Mr. X' and did not want to be identified,"" U.S. Marshal Pete Elliott said Monday. ""We now know why."" His real name John Donald Cody, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1972, served as a captain in the U.S. Army's military intelligence unit, worked as a lawyer in Arizona and speaks ""many, many different foreign languages,"" Elliott said. Cody, now 65, disappeared in 1984 as IRS agents were investigating him in a case that led to his indictment in 1987 on four counts, including making false statements to an investment brokerage firm, taking stolen funds across state lines and lying on a loan application, according to court documents. But time and technology caught up with Cody when Elliott opened his web browser and began a series of Google searches. ""I happened to be a little bored that Friday afternoon,"" Elliott said Monday. ""Thank goodness for Google."" He searched for cold-case fraud fugitives with ties to military, he said. Google images yielded a 1969 photo of a man with a pompadour hairstyle in a military uniform and several later photos of the same man with a similar haircut, he said. Both Cody and Thompson favored the pompadour, he said. ""In our profession, one and one always equals two, and I believe man is always a creature of habit, no matter what identity he takes,"" Elliott said. He also found an FBI wanted flyer for a cold-case fraud fugitive wanted since 1987. It was from 1987 when the FBI began searching for Cody. Since Cody fled before he was arrested, the FBI had no fingerprints to compare to Thompson. But the military did, and they matched, Elliott said. The ""Thompson"" case drew a lot of attention in May when ""Thompson"" was arrested in Oregon after a two-year nationwide manhunt during which he was placed on the list of ""America's Most Wanted"" fugitives. Investigators found almost $1 million in a storage unit the arrest. Cody allegedly founded a fake charity -- the U.S. Navy Veterans Association -- through which he collected nearly $2 million from donors in 41 states in a telemarketing scam between 2005 and 2010, authorities said. While the government acknowledged a possible connection between Cody and a FBI espionage investigation, no other details have been disclosed.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Palestinian inmates began leaving Israeli jails early Tuesday, setting in motion the historic swap that will trade more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for one captured Israeli soldier. A total of 477 prisoners were being moved to meeting points with the Red Cross, according to a spokeswoman at Israel's Prison Authority. Israeli radio reported that more than 1,000 police officers were deployed to ensure public order and the safety of the convoys, which headed to the Egyptian border. Late Monday, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected appeals against the release of prisoners in exchange for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Israel and Hamas approved the deal last week, agreeing to release in two stages 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis. The second stage is scheduled to happen later this year. Shalit has been held incommunicado by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza, since his seizure. The Israeli public overwhelmingly supports the swap for Shalit, an Israeli army sergeant who was abducted in a raid in 2006, when he was 19 years old. Israelis are equally split on whether ""the release of terrorists"" will harm Israeli security, with 50% saying ""Yes"" and 48% saying ""No"" -- a statistical tie given the number of people polled. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote to the families of terror victims to say he understood their pain. ""You were in my thoughts during the many uncertainties that have accompanied me in the negotiations,"" he said in the letter, which was released by his office. ""The decision regarding the release of Gilad Shalit is one of the hardest I have taken ... I understand the difficulty in digesting that these villains who committed these crimes against your loved ones will not be paying the full price that they deserve to,"" Netanyahu wrote. But, he said: ""The state of Israel does not abandon its soldiers and its citizens."" Nearly eight out of 10 Israelis favor the deal, according to the poll of 500 people conducted by the Dahaf Polling Institute for the daily Yedioth Aharonoth. The families of some Palestinian prisoners being released had mixed feelings about the swap, they told CNN. Mohamad Abu Khalil, whose son Ayman got three life sentences plus 90 years in jail, is glad his son is being freed -- but said he won't be coming home. ""It's better that Ayman is going to be released from Israeli jails, but sad that he won't be around his family here. It's better to be transferred to another country than being in Israeli jails,"" his father said. The official Israeli list of prisoner releases lists him as being sent ""abroad,"" rather than to Gaza or the West Bank, without specifying where. The Israel Defense Forces declared a number of sites connected to the prisoner transfer and Shalit release to be closed military zones as of Monday. The prisoners list released by Israel features 477 names, including those of Ahlam Tamimi, serving life terms for being an accomplice in the 2001 bombing of a Sbarro pizza restaurant, and Amneh Muna, who plotted the killing of a 16-year-old Israeli boy in 2001 and received a life sentence. The most notable name not on the list is that of jailed Palestinian lawmaker Marwan Barghouti, who is serving five life sentences. He was convicted in an Israeli court on murder and other charges related to his role in planning attacks on Israelis during the second Intifada. Israel's Prisons Authority said the Palestinians slated for release are being taken to two facilities -- one for the 27 female prisoners on the list, the rest for the men -- from which they will be released together. Once freed, they will be under various restrictions on a case-by-case basis: Some will not be allowed to leave the country, while others will have other restrictions on their movement or be required to report their whereabouts to local police, Justice Ministry spokesman Moshe Cohen told CNN. Shalit, meanwhile, will be transferred back into Israeli territory via the Kerem Shalom border crossing and will undergo medical tests and debriefing at an air force base, the Israeli military said. Once that is complete, he will be flown to his home at Mitzpe Hila, north of Haifa.

"Rome (CNN) -- The brother of an Italian girl missing for nearly 30 years urged the Vatican to investigate her case as several hundred demonstrators carrying pictures of her marched to St. Peter's Square on Sunday. The march came a day after Italian prosecutor Giancarlo Capaldo told CNN that a priest who used to run a church in Rome is under investigation on suspicion of complicity in the abduction of Emanuela Orlandi. Msgr. Piero Vergari, the former rector of Sant'Apollinare, is being investigated along with four members of a criminal gang, Capaldo said Saturday. Missing children, perception vs. reality . Vergari, who left the position in 1991, did not reply to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. ""We want the Vatican to open a serious investigation into the case,"" said Piero Orlandi, the missing girl's brother. Sunday's march is the latest attempt to get to the bottom of one of Rome's most enduring mysteries, the disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi, the daughter of a Vatican employee. Orlandi, then aged 15, was last seen at her flute lesson at a music school on the grounds of Sant'Apollinaire late on the afternoon of June 22, 1983. The case has spawned conspiracy theories pointing the finger at everything from the Mafia to the Vatican itself. We recommend: Body of missing Harvard student found . A top Vatican exorcist, the Rev. Gabriele Amorth, told CNN he suspected the girl had been abducted for sexual reasons, saying ""The investigation should be carried out inside the Vatican and not outside."" Two weeks ago, police acting on an anonymous tip opened the crypt of a mob boss in the Church of Sant'Apollinaire in search of the girl's remains. The Vatican had given investigators special permission to open the tomb of Enrico ''Renatino'' De Pedis following a 2005 phone call to a television program saying the truth would be found there. Investigators found dozens metal boxes, all containing bones, inside the crypt that contained the remains of De Pedis. Most are probably hundreds of years old but a source close to the investigation said some are much more recent. Is this what Baby Gabriel looks like now? Testing them will be ""a long job, weeks or months,"" the source said, asking not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. ""It's like a puzzle of bones."" Supporters of the Orlandi family chanted ""Truth, truth"" in St. Peter's Square outside the Vatican on Sunday. Some wore headbands like the one Orlandi wore in one of the most reproduced pictures of her, while others held white balloons and banners. Rome's Palazzo del Campidoglio displayed a giant poster of the missing girl on Sunday. A former mayor of Rome expressed hope Sunday that the Vatican would do more to help with the investigation. ""The Vatican attitude has changed, they are more cooperative,"" said ex-mayor Walter Veltroni, who is close to the Orlandi family. Veltroni made an appeal for anyone who knows the truth to come forward. ""I'm sure there are many people in Rome that know and that could help to discover the truth,"" he said. ""It's time for them to talk.""","Emanuela Orlandi vanished from Rome at the age of 15 nearly 30 years ago .

"New York (CNN) -- The details of the prisoner-exchange deal announced between Israel and Hamas -- a swap of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas since 2006, for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners -- are not yet fully known. But after five years of failed negotiations, it is clear that both sides have made concessions. And that is a sign of hope. The unrest in the Middle East, and especially in Syria, has been a powerful catalyst for Hamas to capitalize while it can on Israel's desire to bring Shalit home. The unrest in Damascus is forcing the external political leadership of Hamas, led by Khaled Meshaal, to relocate to the Gulf -- further away from the front lines with Israel and a political environment less sympathetic to its radical policies. The huge upsurge of popularity for Hamas's rival, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, following last month's push for UN recognition of Palestine as a member state, would also have been a catalyst for Hamas to conclude an agreement by being more flexible. The return home of 1,000 prisoners, including some (but not all) of the most hardcore terrorists with the blood of hundreds of Israelis on their hands, will do wonders for Hamas' popularity -- not only in Gaza but in the West Bank and the Palestinian diaspora as well. From the Hamas point of view, the time for a deal had clearly arrived. For Israel, the growing instability in Egypt was a factor making a deal imperative now, or a risk that it would never happen. The Egyptians have played a major role as intermediaries, allowing both sides to negotiate without actually having to deal directly. (In the last stage of the bargaining, held in Cairo since July, Israel's negotiators sat in one room and Hamas in another, and the Egyptians acted as go-between.) The Egyptians will play a role in the actual physical exchange of the prisoners as well. Given that Cairo mobs sacked Israel's embassy there just a month ago and that the military rulers of Egypt had to be forced (by the US) to intervene, Israel has good reason to fear that Egypt's ability to facilitate the deal with Hamas might not last forever. Another consideration was the determination by the Israel Defense Forces' new Chief of Staff, Benny Gantz, that there were no realistic military options for freeing Shalit. He was joined by the recently appointed heads of Israel's other security services -- the Mossad and the Shabak (internal security) -- who withdrew their opposition to the release of so many convicted terrorists. No Israeli Prime Minister would have overridden the unanimous recommendations of the security establishment, and the green light for the agreement from this sector was vital. Similarly, no Israeli politician would have overridden public sentiment on this issue, but here the vast majority of Israel's public has been clearly in favor of the swap agreement for the past few years. This sentiment was skillfully articulated through a public campaign conducted by the Shalit family, their friends and associates. Shalit's family have been camping outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem for well over a year, and as they return home to prepare for the return of their son, the Israeli public cheers their dedication. Concern over the possible renewal of Palestinian terror following the release of so many skilled and determined terrorists is, for the moment at least, overshadowed by widespread enthusiasm at the return of the kidnapped soldier. There will be celebrations in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. But what are the long-term implications of this deal? Pessimists will point to the dangers of rewarding terror -- both the terror of those released from jail and the act of kidnapping Israelis to have future terrorists released. Cynics will ask if Israel's willingness to conclude the deal was not an attempt to punish Abbas for pushing ahead with his policies in the UN, despite Israeli and American opposition. But there are other considerations which give grounds for optimism. Any movement in the stalled peace process might be enough to get the wheels of this heavy cart out of the rut in which it is trapped. It appears that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had a role in the final deal, perhaps indicating a return of Turkey to constructive dealing with Israel. And the fact that Israel and Hamas have talked -- albeit indirectly -- is a welcome development. Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza might have had more positive long-term effect had this channel of communication been used then. Even more significant, the release of these prisoners removes a major obstacle from any future peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. An agreement will almost certainly address the issue of the thousands of Palestinians remaining in Israeli jails. Their numbers have dropped dramatically over the past few years, as the level of violence in the occupied territories has declined -- from 11,000 in 2008 to just over 4,000 after the current prisoner swap is completed. But freeing almost all of the most dangerous prisoners now, in circumstances that will be endorsed by Israeli public opinion, means there is one less impediment to be dealt with in the final settlement. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ronald W. Zweig.","Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas since 2006, is being freed .

"Long Beach, California (CNN) -- It was after the robotic hummingbird flew around the auditorium -- and after a speaker talked about the hypersonic plane that could fly from New York to the West Coast in 11 minutes -- that things got really edgy. Vijay Kumar, an engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, showed the more than 1,300 attendees at last week's TED conference several videos in which fleets of tiny flying robots performed a series of intricate manuevers, working together on tasks without colliding or interfering with each others' flightworthiness. It seemed that, at least for some in the audience, a bridge had been crossed into a new era of technology, one that could change the way we think about robots and their application to such fields as construction, shipping and responding to emergencies. Kumar's devices (he calls them ""Autonomous Agile Aerial Robots"") cooperated on building simple structures and showed they were capable of entering a building for the first time and quickly constructing a map that would allow for assessment and response to a structural collapse or fire. He held up one robot, designed by his students Daniel Mellinger and Alex Kushleyev, which weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound and is about 8 inches in diameter. The device has four rotors; when they spin at the same speed, the robot hovers. If you increase the speed, Kumar explained, the robot flies up. Spinning one rotor faster than the one opposite it causes the robot to tilt. It also can flip over multiple times without losing its ability to fly and can recover its stability when thrown into the air. The robots are capable of learning trajectories and manueuvers that can enable them to literally fly through hoops -- and other confined spaces. When the robots are formed into a flotilla, they calculate (a hundred times a second) and maintain a safe distance between them. He showed a video of 20 robots flying in a variety of formations -- and moving through obstacles -- inches from each other without interfering with the stability of their neighbors. To cap his presentation, he showed a video, created by his students in three days, of nine flying robots playing the James Bond theme on musical instruments. TED began in the 1980s with the intention of focusing on ""Technology, entertainment and design,"" and its conferences typically are sold out, attracting an audience of high achievers willing to pay $7,500 to attend. TED, a nonprofit, makes many of the talks freely available on its site. (CNN has a partnership with TED in which it regularly publishes selected TED Talks). TED aims to feature cutting-edge technology at its conferences, and this year's event, labeled ""Full Spectrum,"" was no exception. Yet the uneasy balance between technology and the social issues it spawns seemed to be highlighted more than ever as speakers took the stage to give their talks (and be filmed by eight high-def cameras for eventual viewing on the web). In the first session Tuesday, a sharp contrast was drawn between the unbounding optimism that a technological solution could be found for every one of the Earth's problems and a vision of a planet headed for doom due to mankind's inability to control its inventions and its consumption. Paul Gilding, former head of Greenpeace, declared ""the Earth is full, full of us, full of our stuff, full of our waste and full of our demands,"" and warned of harsh and potentially violent disruption ahead as the reckoning comes for a planet living beyond its means. The idea that the planet can sustain 9 billion people without making disruptive changes is wrong, he said. Peter Diamandis, founder of the X Prize, countered with a catalogue of the ways technology has radically improved our lives -- it has lengthened the human lifespan, conquered many killer diseases, expanded economic opportunity and made possible a worldwide web of communication, already connecting 2 billion people, with 3 billion more on the way to logging in this decade. ""Technology is a resource-liberating force,"" he said, maintaining that a planet bathed in solar energy and covered with water won't lack the ingredients for a productive life. For every tech evangelist, though, there was a cautionary note sounded by other speakers. NASA scientist James Hansen, one of the leading voices warning of global climate change due to carbon emissions, presented an urgent case for taking action to deal with the effects of economic activity before ice caps melt and cities get inundated by dramatic rises in sea level. But an MIT professor, Donald Sadoway, offered reason to hope that the use of non-carbon-emitting solar and wind power could become much more widespread through a new battery technology he and his students are developing to store power for use at times when the wind stops and the sun sets. Sadoway, whose work has attracted an investment from Bill Gates, said successful use of his ""liquid metal battery"" could reduce the need for new fossil-fuel burning power plants. Regina Dugan, who demonstrated the robotic hummingbird and directs the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, talked of research on a prosthetic arm controlled by thoughts alone, of sturdy cars built with metals lighter than Styrofoam and of a robot that can run like a cheetah. TED.com: Susan Cain on the power of introverts . And yet technology didn't seem to have a solution for the problems highlighted by Bryan Stevenson, director of the Equal Justice Initiative. He talked of the rise in the number of imprisoned Americans from 300,000 40 years ago to 2.3 million today, the large number of black Americans who have been permanently deprived of their ability to vote due to prosecution on low-level drug offenses and the question he said is posed by the death penalty -- not whether criminals deserve to die, but whether America as a society, deserves to kill. Stevenson's talk drew a standing ovation -- and the following day, after TED curator Chris Anderson appealed for funds, Anderson said $1.12 million had been raised for Stevenson's nonprofit on the spot. A longtime enthusiast for digital technology, MIT professor Sherry Turkle, spoke of being on the cover of Wired magazine when her book ""Life on the Screen"" was published in the 1990s. In her new and darker book, ""Alone Together,"" she writes of everyday family and social relationships put at risk by the compulsion to interact constantly with mobile devices as a substitute for face-to-face interaction. People text during board meetings, shop and text during class, and even text during funerals, she said. Technology gives us the illusion of being constantly in touch with people, yet we shirk the real demands of friendship. And Turkle pointed out that Japanese researchers are developing robots to provide care to the elderly and to children. As if to emphasize her point, a day after her talk, Danish scientist Henrik Scharfe demo'ed Geminoid-DK, a shockingly realistic robot version of himself. While its movement and speech is limited, the robot's technology is likely to evolve quickly. And so it seemed that it wasn't only in jest that Scharfe said, ""Ten years from now, I'll be at home having a beer in Denmark and the robot will come to TED to give a talk."" Scharfe said after his talk that he recognized the dangers Turkle talked about, but he thought developing the robot was well worth doing. ""This can never be about replacing the human being,"" he said in his talk, ""but about using technology to understand the full spectrum of being human.""","Vijay Kumar demonstrated fleets of flying robots that could revolutionize industries .

"(CNN) -- Tito Joseph ""TJ"" Jackson, who on Wednesday was named temporary guardian of Michael Jackson's three children, was inspired by his famous uncle to form a singing group with his brothers. TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children . A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: ""My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff."" They were close to their Uncle Michael. ""He's like a third parent to us,"" Taj told People in 1995. Eventually the brothers went along on one of his tours and decided to form a singing group and were recording their first album in 1994 at the time of their mother's death. Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her. Three years later, Donald Bohana was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, according to People magazine. The last 3T album came out in 2005, according to Billboard.com, but the brothers performed together at a tribute concert for their late uncle in October 2011.

"(CNN) -- After hours of debate and forceful arguments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli cabinet this week approved a deal to exchange more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, many linked to some of the deadliest terror attacks on Israeli civilians in recent years, for the release of an Israeli solider captured by militants more than five years ago. Sgt. Gilad Shalit has been held captive by Hamas without any contact with the outside world since the summer of 2006, and efforts to end his captivity have become a rallying cry for thousands of Israelis who have actively supported efforts by his family to put pressure on the government to bring about his release. While the deal to free Shalit was backed by a commanding Cabinet majority of 26-3 and enjoys wide support from the Israeli public, there is growing debate about the price Israel is willing to pay in order to free a single soldier. Families of victims of terror, as well as some members of the Israeli government, have expressed fierce opposition to the deal. One minister who voted against the agreement called it ""a great victory for terrorism,"" and there are fears that the release of convicted murderers will lead to further attacks on Israeli civilians -- a fear that, critics say, is borne out by statistics. According to Israeli association of terror victims Almagor, 180 Israelis have lost their lives to terrorists freed in previous deals since 2000. Difficult decisions about prisoner releases are not new to the Israeli government. Israel has a long history of freeing large numbers of prisoners in exchange for its soldiers and citizens. The most notable of all was the Jibril Deal of 1985. The Israeli government headed by then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres (the current president) agreed to release 1,150 prisoners in exchange for three Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon by the Palestinian Militant Front led by Ahmed Jibril. The deal aroused immense controversy due to the stark asymmetry. Yitzhak Navon, the only minister who voted against the agreement, said then, ""I thought this was a terrible example, for us to show all our enemies that for them the best deal is to kidnap soldiers and citizens. We must have the strength to tell the families of the captive soldiers -- there is a line that the nation cannot cross."" And pushing this latest deal is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has built a reputation as a strong opponent to deals with terrorists. Three years after the Jibril Deal, Netanyahu explained his philosophy about negotiating with terrorists to CNN's Larry King. ""On one case I did not swallow it. When my government did something that I simply could not live with, which was the release of jailed terrorists for three of our POWs. We wanted to get our POWs back, and the government, in my judgment, made a big mistake and traded terrorists. And here I was confronted with a situation that everything I believe in, in fact agitated for and tried to use an example of Israel for, to encourage other countries, especially the United States, to adopt a tough no-concessions policy against terrorists."" In his 1995 book ""A Place in the Sun"" Netanyahu called the Jibril Deal ""a fatal blow to Israel's efforts to form an international front against terrorism"" and warned of the hazardous consequences of such moves. ""The release of a thousand terrorists...will inevitably lead to a terrible escalation of violence, because these terrorists will be accepted as heroes,"" Netanyahu wrote. In making those arguments, it is likely Netanyahu was aware of the aftermath of the Jibril Deal. Almagor says that ""out of 238 terrorists freed in the Jibril Deal who reached the West Bank, 48 percent returned to terrorism and were recaptured by Israeli forces."" In order to better understand the special status of Shalit in the Israeli public eye, one needs to go back 25 years to the crash of an Israeli warplane in Lebanon. On board the plane was Israeli air force Navigator Ron Arad, who was captured alive by local Shiite group Amal and later handed over to Hezbollah. Despite reports of several attempts to negotiate his return, Israel failed to free Arad, and as the years passed traces of his whereabouts had been lost. In June of 2008 Hezbollah announced that Arad was no longer alive. Arad has become a symbol of the failure of Israeli governments over the years to strike a deal that would bring him back alive to his family. Shalit supporters have expressed fears that if a deal was not reached soon, the young soldier's fate could be similar to that of Arad. Speaking to his cabinet this week, Netanyahu said that with so much change sweeping the region, he did not know whether a better deal for Shalit was possible, and warned that if the window of opportunity was not taken it could close indefinitely. It represented a vast change in outlook and rhetoric for the combative prime minister, who seems to have calculated that a softer approach was the more politically expedient road to follow. Whether it was the prospect of going down in history as the Israeli leader who missed the chance to free Shalit, the calculation of larger geopolitical changes in the region, or a mere reflection of public sentiment, Netanyahu has chosen a path that has taken him away from much of what he has spent decades preaching.","Gilad Shalit has been held captive by Hamas since the summer of 2006 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The paparazzi pursuit of Justin Bieber along Los Angeles freeways is a ""tragedy waiting to happen,"" a Los Angeles city councilman warned. Dennis Zine, who has sponsored tougher punishment for photographers who break the law while stalking celebrities, witnessed an example Friday of why the practice is so dangerous. ""I expected to see a crash,"" said Zine, a 33-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and still a reserve officer. ""The danger is of someone getting killed."" Bieber's Fisker Karma -- a $100,000 electric sports car -- looked like a silver bullet as it zoomed past Zine at 100 mph on U.S. 101 Friday morning, he said. ""He was coming up behind me, making abrupt lane changes, not giving signals, cutting off cars."" Four or five other cars followed close behind, apparently carrying photographers stalking Bieber, he said. ""They were close by, at a rapid speed, all of them."" DA considers battery charge against Justin Bieber . ""It's like a miracle that nothing happened,"" Zine said. ""It was mere luck that no one got involved in a collision."" The high-speed chase, which Zine estimated went for 15 miles, ended when a California Highway Patrol officer, alerted by Zine's call, stopped Bieber and cited him for speeding. Not only were the photographers not ticketed, but the officer allowed them to snap photos as Bieber was cited. ""He let all the paparazzi just around my vehicle while he was doing the whole citation,"" Bieber said in his own 911 call a few minutes later. Bieber, sounding frustrated, called 911 for help after he resumed his drive toward downtown Los Angeles, complaining that the same cars were chasing him again. The highway patrol won't release the recording of Bieber's call until its investigation of the paparazzi's pursuit is concluded, Officer Mike Harris said. But a copy was leaked to radio host DJ Laz, who aired it on his syndicated morning show Monday. ""They're being very dangerous, swerving around other cars trying to get to me,"" Bieber told the dispatcher. ""And when I get to a stop they pull up next to me and just be, like, just harass me."" But unlike earlier, Bieber said he was just driving 50 mph. ""They're driving really reckless,"" he told the dispatcher. ""They just will not stop following me."" Zine, who heard the call, criticized Bieber for initially giving the dispatcher a fake name, Justin Johnson, and ""hem-hawing"" without explaining he was a celebrity being chased by photographers. ""When you give information to a dispatcher, you want to be accurate."" But the dispatcher soon realized she was talking to Bieber, who she knew had been stopped minutes earlier. ""I was trying to go fast so that I could lose these people and I got pulled over. And then the police told me if they kept following me to call again,"" Bieber told her. Justin Bieber's 'Believe' year's biggest debut . When she asked him if he wanted a highway patrol unit to intervene and stop the cars from following him, he said, ""I would love that."" When a patrol car caught up with Bieber in downtown Los Angeles 15 minutes later, he filed a complaint which prompted a police investigation to see if any photographers will be charged with breaking California's paparazzi law, Harris said. A conviction under the law passed two years ago, and pushed by Zine, could bring up to a year in prison and a $5,000 fine for each count of breaking traffic laws while pursuing a celebrity. Avoiding tragedy is up to the celebrity, since ""he's not going to get a police escort everywhere he goes,"" Zine said. In Bieber's case, his choice of a very visible, exotic sports car is not recommended, he said. ""You're waving the big flag that says 'Here I am,'"" Zine said. ""Put that car in the garage for a while and get something that's not as recognizable."" Bieber officially graduates . Most celebrities realize this and drive less conspicuous vehicles, he said. Zine, who served much of his law enforcement career as a motorcycle officer, suggested that whenever Bieber or other celebs are pursued by paparazzi they should ""slow down, get off the freeway and call 911."" ""The faster you go, the faster they're going to go,"" he said. No lives should be placed at risk, he said. ""It's not like they were trying to mug him, trying to kill him. They're trying to take a picture,"" Zine said. Zine compared Friday's scene to the paparazzi chase in Paris that ended with the crash that killed Britain's Princess Diana 15 years ago. ""This is a tragedy waiting to happen,"" he said ""It will happen unless he is somehow restricted in his driving habits.""

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Juana Reyes didn't think that selling chicken, pork and chili cheese tamales would buy her a one-way ticket out of the country. But it just might. Reyes is a Sacramento, California, woman who the media is calling ""the tamale lady."" A 46-year-old single mother of two and illegal immigrant, Reyes faces deportation by the Obama administration. So what's the problem? Aren't illegal immigrants supposed to be deported? Sure. But there are rules to the game, and the administration keeps breaking them. This case undermines the claim that the immigration crackdown is targeting hardened criminals. Reyes' trouble started on June 28 when she was arrested outside a Walmart by Sacramento County Sheriff's deputies and charged with trespassing and interfering with a business. What exactly was the interference? Reyes is unemployed. She was selling tamales so she could buy food and clothes for her two children -- 10-year-old Cesar and 7-year-old Montserrat, both of whom were born in the United States. News: Young immigrants prepare for new U.S. deportation policy . Think about it. This woman wasn't holding a handmade sign that read: ""Will work for food."" She was working by making food and selling it. Reyes says that she was a familiar presence in the parking lot, and that her customers included Walmart employees. On this day, she was asked to leave, by a security guard and a sheriff's deputy. She did leave, but she returned when she saw other vendors outside the store. She was arrested. Suspecting Reyes was in the country illegally, the sheriff's deputies handcuffed the mother and placed her children in a squad car and drove them to the sheriff's station. Then they called Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which put a ""hold"" on her that resulted in her being locked up in the county jail for nearly two weeks without a lawyer. When ICE agents finally visited the jail, they determined she was in fact in the country illegally and took her into custody and put her children in foster care while she was being detained. Now Reyes is awaiting deportation. Really? Handcuffing her for trespassing? Holding a woman for nearly two weeks without a lawyer? What were these people thinking? News: Breaking down the Supreme Court decision on Arizona's immigration law . All for selling tamales. Some will insist that Reyes is actually being punished for coming into the United States illegally. But this woman only came to the attention of federal authorities because local law enforcement officers arrested her for an infraction that would have normally resulted in a slap on the wrist. And the reason that she was arrested was because she was selling tamales. Judging from media reports, some people in Sacramento agree that the feds are overdoing it, and say that local cops ought not be accomplices. But, for many others, the conversation stopped when they heard Reyes was living in the country illegally -- perhaps for as long as 20 years. They think she got what she deserved. What kind of immigration policy does America deserve? The presidential candidates offer a choice: Hands off, or all thumbs. Democrats mock Mitt Romney's claim that, if jobs dry up, illegal immigrants will ""self deport"" and take their children with them. The Obama administration likes to give the impression that it has a more humane approach. Instead of illegal immigrants voluntarily taking their children to their home countries with them, the kids are seized by authorities and given to other people through the foster care system. When it comes to immigration, Obama is a bully. He's trying to build support with conservatives and organized labor by deporting as many illegal immigrants as possible, nearly 1.5 million since taking office. The administration accomplished this feat by arm-twisting localities and states into participating in a dreadful program called Secure Communities. It requires that local law enforcement submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of people they arrest who they suspect are in the country illegally. Navarrette: 'Illegal immigrant' is the uncomfortable truth . Guess whom those local cops, many of whom have no training in the enforcement of immigration law, often suspect? Latinos. That's ethnic profiling. In fact, last year, a report by U.C. Berkeley's Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Law and Social Policy confirmed that Secure Communities disproportionately targets Latinos. The law enforcement partnership was initially marketed as voluntary -- until states like New York and Massachusetts tried to opt out, and then suddenly it became mandatory. It was also supposed to concentrate only on violent criminals -- until we learned that it also ensnared scores of folks without criminal records such as gardeners, housekeepers, nannies, traffic violators -- and yes, tamale vendors. Recently, a group of three national immigration advocacy groups claimed to have found evidence that, in California, Secure Communities isn't just reserved for violent criminals. Under the Freedom of Information Act, the groups obtained e-mails between the FBI and the state of California that allegedly show that the program has resulted in the deportation of people who have never been arrested. Navarrette: How Arizona law hurts Hispanic citizens . This being an election year, President Obama is trying to downplay the deportations and convince Latino voters that his administration has become more lenient. In June, Obama himself announced what was billed as a major policy change at the Department of Homeland Security where so-called DREAM'ers who met certain qualifications would be spared deportation and issued work permits. To qualify, candidates had to be under age 31, have come to the United States before age 16, have lived here for at least five years, have no criminal record, and either be in school, a high school graduate, or a military veteran. Reyes doesn't meet all those qualifications. Obama's Latino defenders buy the line that this is a kinder and gentler administration. They'll buy anything to keep from admitting that they made a mistake in 2008 and helped put in office the most anti-immigrant president in a half century. Navarrette: For immigrants and opponents, court's ruling hits their real lives . But on the ground, in immigrant communities, they know better. They know that it is business as usual. And they can point to the miscarriages of justice that prove it. Just ask the tamale lady.

Now in its 19th year, the index is a guide to your investment decisions -- specifically how the benchmark Hong Kong Hang Seng Index will perform -- over the next 12 months, based on the ancient Chinese art (or science, if you prefer) of feng shui. If you are wondering what that entails, this report consults the experts on bazi (fortune charts), wu-xing (five-element theory) and xuan kong (flying stars). CLSA itself describes the report as a light-hearted exercise. But before anyone dismisses this as a mere marketing ploy or mystical mumbo-jumbo, take a look at last year's forecast. It is a pretty close match to how the Hang Seng actually performed. The brokerage has a team of about six people plus feng shui masters -- they won't say who they are -- working on the report for several months leading up to the publication. What do the geomancers say? First the good news. It will be a good year for the Hang Seng, particularly in the first half and March is flagged as a standout month. It's interesting that March is also the month that the U.S. Congress has to deal with the debt-ceiling. After June the ride gets much rougher and more volatile. A trading opportunity perhaps? The CLSA index also looks at health, relationships and work for the year to come. If you were born in the year of the Rooster, Dog or Ox (Cow), it is going to be a great year, says the report. If you are a Pig, Goat (Sheep), Tiger or Snake, it's best to fast forward to 2014. Interestingly, those with the same birth sign as the year sign invariably have bad years. There's something else to keep in mind. The Snake sheds its skin, which in the Chinese horoscope signals new ideas or developments, both good and bad. The Depression year of 1929 was a Snake year, as was 1989 (Tiananmen Square) and 2001 (the 9/11 attacks). In fact the past five Snake years have not been very encouraging, says the report. But this time around it will be different because all five elements -- earth, metal, wood, water and fire -- are present. In the first half of the year, fire is strong and fire drives markets higher, according to the report. In the second half, the fire influence wanes and water starts rising, a bad sign for the markets. The good news is that the year ends with the index higher than the start of the year. The bad news is, if you are actually born a Snake, the year will be, in CLSA's own words, a bit of a ""hisser.""","Hong Kong group CLSA has released its Feng Shui Index for 2013 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than 100 retired U.S. military leaders -- including the former head of the Naval Academy -- have signed a statement calling for an end to the military's ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy, according to a California-based think tank that supports the movement. The ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy should go, says a statement signed by 104 retired U.S. military leaders. Retired Adm. Charles Larson, the former Naval Academy superintendent, tops the list of 104 retired general and admirals who want the government to repeal the policy, the Palm Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, announced Monday. ""Don't ask-don't tell"" was made law in 1993 after opposition ballooned to newly elected President Bill Clinton's plan to lift the military's complete ban on gay service members. The new policy stopped the practice of asking potential service members if they are gay but still required the dismissal of openly gay service members. The Palm Center, which circulated the statement calling for the repeal of the ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy, is looking to President-elect Barack Obama to address the controversial issue of gays in the military. The center points out that Larson, a four-star admiral who supported the measure in 1993, has changed his view on the policy. ""There were a lot of witch hunts and a lot of people were turned out on that basis,"" he is quoted as saying in a Palm Center release. In July, a House panel weighed overturning the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy -- the first time Congress had considered the rule since it was implemented 15 years ago. During the hearing, two gay former service members -- former Navy Capt. Joan Dorrah and former Marine Sgt. Eric Alva -- testified against the current law, arguing that unit cohesion would not be hurt if homosexuals served openly.  But Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness said allowing gays to serve openly in the military would be disruptive. ""Such a policy would impose new, unneeded burdens of sexual tension on men and women serving in high pressure working conditions, far from home, that are unlike any occupation in the civilian world,"" Donnelly said. Brian Jones, a retired sergeant major in the Army, also argued that allowing gays to serve publicly could hurt recruiting. ""Allowing homosexuality in the military would cause unnecessary sexual tension and disruptions to good order, morale, discipline and unit cohesion,"" Jones said. ""This would erode the very qualities of military service that presently appeal to potential recruits."" Obama has said that as president, he would seek to repeal ""don't ask-don't tell,"" but not by signing an executive order, as President Harry Truman did when he abolished segregation the armed services in 1948. ""I would not do it that way,"" he said in a September 16 interview with Philadelphia Gay News. ""The reason is because I want to make sure that when we reverse 'don't ask-don't tell,' it's gone through a process and we've built a consensus or at least a clarity of ... what my expectations are, so that it works."" ""I believe that the way to do it is make sure that we are working through a process, getting the Joint Chiefs of Staff clear in terms of what our priorities are going to be. That's how we were able to integrate the armed services to get women more actively involved in the armed services. ""At some point, you've got to make a decision that that's the right thing to do, but you always want to make sure that you are doing it in a way that maintains our core mission in our military."" The Palm Center's release comes just four months after a study conducted by a group of senior retired military officers recommended ditching the military's ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy. The group reported they found no evidence that the primary rationale for imposing the policy -- that openly gay or lesbian service members pose ""an unacceptable risk"" to morale and unit cohesion -- remains valid. ""While this may have been true in 1993, there are indications that this may no longer be the case,"" the report said. ""In 1993, the finding of 'unacceptable risk' was based on the views of currently serving service members and military leaders, and on the experiences of foreign militaries."" The report also noted the policy has forced out of the military some very talented personnel and put commanders in the position of breaking the law or damaging the unit's cohesion by forcing out ""qualified, meritorious"" service members. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 75 percent of respondents supported allowing gays to serve openly in the military, up from 62 percent in 2001 and 44 percent in 1993. To meet its goals of increasing numbers, the military has recruited thousands of convicted felons and illegal drug users under its ""moral waivers"" program, the report noted, while dismissing hundreds more for being gay. The statement signed by Larson and other top brass reads: . ""We -- the undersigned -- respectfully call for the repeal of the 'don't ask-don't tell' policy. Those of us endorsing this letter have dedicated our lives to defending the rights of our citizens to believe whatever they wish. Scholarly data shows there are approximately 1 million gay and lesbian veterans in the United States today as well as 65,000 gays and lesbians currently serving in our armed forces. They have served our nation honorably. We support the recent comments of former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. John Shalikashvili, who has concluded that repealing the 'don't ask-don't tell' policy would not harm and would indeed help our armed forces. As is the case with Great Britain, Israel and other nations that allow gays and lesbians to serve openly, our service members are professionals who are able to work together effectively despite differences in race, gender, religion and sexuality. Such collaboration reflects the strength and the best traditions of our democracy.""","104 retired general and admirals want the government to repeal the policy .

"(CNN) -- Penn State University has paid out $5.76 million to the estate of Joe Paterno, its heralded head football coach who lost his job as part of a spiraling sex abuse scandal involving one of his former assistants, a school athletic official said Thursday. Jeff Nelson, an assistant athletic director and spokesman for the university, said via e-mail that more than half of the payout -- $3 million -- was in the form of a retirement bonus. The school gave Paterno's estate the balance of his employment contract because his exit as head of the Nittany Lions' football program was officially considered a retirement, not a termination, according to Nelson. More details will be posted on http://openness.psu.edu, a website set up by the school to provide information about the case. The university's board of trustees fired Paterno last November because its members thought he failed to take his knowledge of a scandal at the school to the appropriate authorities, the board said in a report posted last month. The controversy revolves around Jerry Sandusky, 68, a longtime defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions. He faces 52 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys dating back to 1994, with prosecutors alleging that some of this illicit behavior occurred in Penn State athletic facilities. Paterno testified to a grand jury that a graduate assistant told him in 2002 that he had seen Sandusky in the showers ""fondling or doing something of a sexual nature to a young boy."" ""While Coach Paterno did his legal duty by reporting that information the next day ... to his immediate superior, the then Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley, the board reasonably inferred that he did not call police,"" said the report explaining Paterno's firing. ""We determined that his decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership by Coach Paterno."" Curley and Gary Schultz, a senior vice president at the university, are charged with perjury and failure to report a crime in relation to the investigation -- specifically, the account passed on to them by Paterno. Paterno himself was never charged with a crime. His ouster as coach, hours after he issued a statement saying he'd retire at the end of the 2011 season, spurred riots by his supporters on the Penn State campus. In his final interview in January, he told the Washington Post that he'd felt inadequate to deal with the initial allegation of abuse -- saying he ""didn't know exactly how to handle it and ... was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was."" Paterno, 85, died January 22 at a hospital in State College after battling lung cancer. Just before the scandal erupted, he'd become the winningest coach in major college football history by leading his teams to 409 victories. In 46 years under his leadership, the Nittany Lions won two national championships, went undefeated five times and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times, according to his official Penn State biography. CNN's Andy Rose contributed to this report.","Penn State trustees ousted Joe Paterno as head football coach last November .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russia's security service has foiled a plot to attack the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Black Sea city of Sochi, state media reported Thursday. Authorities arrested three men this week in Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia on charges of plotting the attack in a joint operation with Abkhazian security services, the Russian National Anti-Terrorism Committee said, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. The three are suspected of being ringleaders of a regional cell of the North Caucasus-based terrorist group Caucasus Emirate. Police seized weapons, including three portable surface-to-air missiles, two anti-tank guided missiles, a mortar and a flamethrower, the news agency said. The militants planned to move the arms to the nearby resort city of Sochi and use them to carry out terrorist attacks during the Games, it quoted the National Anti-Terrorism Committee as saying. The U.S. State Department added the Caucasus Emirate, a Chechen group based in the North Caucasus, to its list of foreign terrorist groups, and has authorized a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of its leader, Doku Umarov. The State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. His group also claimed responsibility for last year's bombing of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow that killed 36 people, the 2010 bombings of the Moscow subway that killed 40 and the 2009 bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died.

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- Paul Ryan's journey from congressman to vice-presidential candidate was cloaked in secrecy worthy of a big-screen thriller. In the culminating scene, Ryan -- policy wonk, statistics nerd, father of three -- crept through the woods behind his Wisconsin home for a clandestine pickup by a top aide Friday afternoon. For Ryan, who days earlier had agreed to become the running mate of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, it was only the latest episode in an elaborate campaign undertaking designed to escape detection before the candidate's formal announcement in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday. Bold VP pick could woo key voters . Longtime Romney aide Beth Myers ran the former Massachussetts governor's four-month vice-presidential search and played a key role in the cloak-and-dagger aspect of those final days. She briefed reporters on the entire process Saturday afternoon. The search began in early April with a large group of potential picks. Throughout the process, Myers and Romney were compulsively careful to prevent any information from leaking to the press. As the months progressed and the research documents on each possible name grew -- including ""several years"" of tax returns that each potential candidate submitted, Myers said -- all the paperwork was stored overnight in a safe in a secure room at the campaign headquarters in Boston. No copies were made of the material, and all work on the vice-presidential effort was done in that room. Four months later, after consulting with ""a lot"" of other people and a final ""gut check"" with his top advisers, Romney decided Paul Ryan was his choice, Myers said. That day, August 1, the presumptive GOP nominee placed a call to Ryan from Myers' office in the campaign headquarters requesting a meeting. The next day, Romney called a man many considered to be at the top of his vice-presidential list, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, to inform his former rival he had not been chosen. Romney called the others on his short list the day before his announcement. On Sunday, August 5, the campaign initiated an array of evasive maneuvers. ""We gave a lot of thought on how to make this work undetected,"" Myers told reporters in a briefing at Dulles Airport in Washington on Saturday. Romney's choice of Ryan changes the race . A major figure in the effort: Myers' 19-year-old son Curt, who was designated to chauffeur Ryan to and from the airport for his meeting with Romney. Ryan caught a flight from Chicago to Hartford, Connecticut, on Sunday. The campaign asked him to dress casually, Myers said. ""Paul was wearing jeans, a casual shirt, baseball hat and sunglasses and passed unnoticed through both airports,"" she said. Curt Myers drove Ryan to his family's home in Brookline, Massachusetts. Romney came down from his New Hampshire summer home, and the two men met for about an hour in the Myerses' dining room. How Ryan could help Romney . ""It was a little longer than an hour, actually,"" Romney said. ""Oh, we talked about the campaign and how it would be run and talked about how we'd work together if we get the White House -- what the relations would be, how we'd interact and be involved in important decisions. But we talked about our families -- what this meant for them, what kind of challenge it meant -- those are the topics we discussed."" When the two left the dining room, ""it was all set,"" Myers said. Then, after Romney had left, Ryan received word of the deadly rampage at a Sikh temple in his Wisconsin district. He spoke with his aides about the crisis while at Myers' home, and returned home to Wisconsin unnoticed. Later in the week, a memorial service for the victims of the shooting prompted the campaign to change its planned announcement. Myers said the vice-presidential event was originally slated for Friday in New Hampshire, but that date conflicted with the service. So the campaign settled on Norfolk, the first city Romney would visit on his upcoming bus tour. Paul Ryan through the years . Which brings the saga back to the wooded area behind Ryan's home. After he returned from the memorial service on Friday, Ryan walked in his front door, through the house and out the back, through the woods, and ended up at the driveway of the house where, coincidentally, he had grown up. ""It wasn't that far of a walk,"" Ryan laughed in a conversation with reporters on a campaign charter from Washington to North Carolina on Saturday. ""I just went out my back door, went through the gully in the woods I grew up playing in. I walked past the fort I built back there."" The Ryan aide who had dropped him off in front of his home then picked Ryan up at the driveway of the other home and drove an hour to a small plane chartered by the campaign at the airport in Waukegan, Illinois, where Ryan met his family. They flew to another tiny airport, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where Curt Myers was again waiting to play a role in the drama. He drove the family to the Fairfield Inn in Elizabeth City, where Beth Myers and several other Romney advisers huddled with Ryan. Curt Myers picked up food from Applebee's for the group, and Beth Myers said: ""Everyone was pretty tired so we did a little speech prep and went to bed."" The next morning a member of the Secret Service met the two-vehicle caravan, and Ryan was driven to the Romney announcement event in Norfolk. At the end of that day, Ryan was still reeling to take in the life-changing experience. ""It's gone from the surreal to the real, I guess,"" he said . Paul Ryan economics: 5 things to know .

"(CNN) -- Global unemployment is rising, with youth feeling the brunt, and companies need to find solutions to set jobseekers on ""a clearer path to success,"" according to Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent. ""It's a matter for government, it's a matter for business, it's a matter for civil society,"" Kent told CNN's Richard Quest recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""It's a matter for all of us. You cannot have a major part of society unhappy because they don't have anywhere to go to work. That cannot continue."" The International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency which oversees global labor standards, reported in January that 5.1 million people will be unable to find a job in 2013. The ILO forecasts a total of 202 million people around the world will be unemployed this year -- a number equal to nearly two thirds of the entire population of the United States. ""We have to not go into a corner and wait for the storm to pass,"" said Kent, who stressed that companies must continue to invest in their businesses. ""Without investment there will not be growth, and without growth there will not be employment."" Despite the 2008 global financial crisis, the eurozone's sovereign debt challenges and China's slower-growing economy, Kent says investment can still be justified and points to Coca-Cola's own recent practices. In June 2012, Coke announced plans to return to Myanmar after a six decade absence. ""We certainly in the last four, five years have continued to invest in our business... have seen opportunities for growth all around the world despite all the difficulties in 2008 and 2009,"" he said. ""And I think we look at the future in the next two, three years and we still see opportunities and we still will invest and create more jobs.""

"(CNN) -- The newly independent Republic of South Sudan has announced the death of a prominent renegade rebel leader. Lt. Gen. George Athor and one of his soldiers were killed in a clash with the country's military, Vice President Riek Machar told reporters Tuesday. He said they had infiltrated South Sudan on their way out of Rwanda via the eastern border area of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. The claim has not been verified by an independent body. A dissident commander of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, or SPLA, Athor rebelled after losing a gubernatorial election in the spring of 2010. He called for numerous orchestrated clashes after the announcement of his defeat. ""Under the banner of his South Sudan Democratic Movement (SSDM) and its military wing, the South Sudan Army, Gen. Athor was considered the most powerful post-election insurrectionist"" the Geneva-based independent research project said in its 2011 report on what was then southern Sudan. The Small Arms Survey says that although both the government of South Sudan and the SPLA have alleged that Athor received support from the Sudan government in Khartoum, there is no independent evidence to support these claims. The death of Athor was not part of a government plan, because the government had declared general amnesty to all rebel groups in South Sudan, the vice president told reporters. The government is appealing to all of Athor's followers to heed the amnesty, which was declared on July 9 when the country celebrated its independence from Sudan. John Prendergast, co-founder of the Enough Project, said the reported death of Athor ""highlights the urgency with which the South Sudan government, with international support, must address inter-communal divisions within the South. Another Athor will emerge tomorrow unless real progress is made in providing political and economic opportunities that feel marginalized in the process of independence.""

"(CNN) -- The president's pick for CIA director -- John Brennan -- is one of a handful of U.S. officials who understands America's covert drone campaign inside and out. Nearly everyone else is in the dark about the whos, wheres and whys of the program, including most members of Congress. But Brennan is also one of the few U.S. officials who's stood in front of a public audience and tried to explain the targeting of terrorists outside recognized battlefields. And while overseeing a massive use of lethal force, Brennan is also known inside the administration as a moderating voice in the fight against terrorism. The fact is, Brennan's personal views are as opaque as the drone campaign itself. He may assume leadership of the CIA and decide a clandestine agency should not conduct what is an obvious military operation (a stance I and many others would fully support); after all, a veteran of the CIA may believe the agency should get back to gritty intelligence gathering. CNN Explains: U.S. drones . Or, maybe Brennan believes that when it comes to the fight against al Qaeda, the public and its Congress should trust the executive office to protect the American people by whatever means it sees fit. One way or the other, this week's Senate confirmation hearings should be an opportunity to bring Brennan's views out of the shadows, along with the basic attributes and justifications of the covert drone campaign. The man, the machine and the policy are inextricably linked. Bergen: John Brennan, America's drone warrior . U.S. officials have consistently claimed that offering too many details about the covert drone program could threaten national security. Fair enough; some classification for national security is understandable. But the secrecy surrounding covert drone use is unduly excessive and not in keeping with the transparent government President Barack Obama promised. Since the bulk of Brennan's hearing will be behind closed doors, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has no reason to shy away from asking tough questions about the drone program. It matters that Congress is there to represent the American people. On their behalf, Congress has a duty to ensure the use of lethal force beyond our borders is being considered and carried out responsibly, with due consideration for the harm it may inflict on civilian populations. Talk Back: Should U.S. be able to kill American terrorist suspects without trial? Senators might ask a very basic question to Brennan, one that is seldom clearly answered by the administration: ""What impact is the drone campaign against al Qaeda and its associates having?"" This is a fundamental question of accountability any U.S. official involved in setting or carrying out counterterrorism policy should be able to answer. That answer may describe a dwindling kill list, but it must also put forward facts about what impact drones are having on civilians living under them. U.S. armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq learned that the positive or negative impacts of an operation on the local population are an important metric of mission effectiveness. Commanders worked hard to reverse anti-American sentiment caused by a seemingly callous U.S. attitude toward civilian deaths and injuries. In the case of counterterrorism operations, palpable anger toward America would be antithetical to the goal of decreasing the number of terrorists and those who support their cause. As it stands, it's unclear whether anyone, including Brennan, knows what negative consequences are emerging on the ground because of remote drones. Rather, claims of low civilian casualties and drone precision capabilities paint a picture of extreme effectiveness in taking out terrorists while sparing civilians. It's true that a drone is precise, meaning it will hit what it is aimed at -- a building, a bunker or a person. But there are valid concerns about whether the target hit is the right one. Opinion: When are drone killings illegal? Remote drones likely rely on sources that may be questionable such as video and cell phone intercepts to identify a target. Civilians may be mistakenly targeted as combatants and counted as such because there are no ground troops to conduct a battle damage assessment, interview witnesses or properly identify bodies. Civilians may also get caught up in so-called ""signature strikes"" in which operators target individuals based on behavior, not on known identity. This is legally questionable but also has real ramifications for civilians living under drones. If a civilian in Pakistan doesn't know what behavior makes him a target for U.S. drones, he cannot fully protect himself and his family. If a drone harms his family, even mistakenly, our research shows they won't receive an apology, explanation or any help from the United States. Certainly there will be no love lost for America. Any deaths and injuries are compounded by psychological trauma, displacement and fear and suspicion among neighbors. One Pakistani told us, ""We fear that the drones will strike us again. ... My aged parents are often in a state of fear. We are depressed, anxious and constantly remembering our deceased family members."" Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the former commander of international forces in Afghanistan, recently noted, ""What scares me about drone strikes is how they are perceived around the world. ... (T)he resentment created by American use of unmanned strikes ... is much greater than the average American appreciates. They are hated on a visceral level, even by people who've never seen one or seen the effects of one."" The drone program needs to come out of the shadows, with explanations about who is a civilian, who is a target, and how drone operators distinguish between the two. The CIA should get out of the drone operation business, handing it over to the Defense Department, which has a culture of learning lessons, accountability to Congress and a new openness about civilian protection after 10 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Drone operators should be trained in civilian protection best practices, and any civilian harmed should receive recognition and help for their losses, in accordance with the values American policymakers have espoused about humanity even during times of war. The Senate may confirm Brennan as head of the CIA. It should also confirm where he stands on government accountability for lethal force and the CIA's role in the remote drone program. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sarah Holewinski.","John Brennan's confirmation hearing is a chance to ask about drone program, author says .

"(CNN) -- It moved half its production to China to keep costs down, but eight years later one company is bringing production back to Britain. It's another example of the backshoring trend that has seen many European manufacturers relocate their business back home. Caldeira is a cushion-making business headquartered in Merseyside, Northern England. Since 2004 it has also had a factory operating in Zhejiang province, China. ""At the time China was about to be admitted to the WTO and our Chinese competitors were actually selling products cheaper than we could make them"", said CEO Tony Caldeira. Read more: Chanel's exclusivity keeps it a cut above . According to Caldeira it was an obvious decision for the company at the time. ""It was a good exchange rate, the salaries were only a tenth of their UK colleagues, a huge labor cost differential between China and the UK."" That has now changed; last year manufacturing wages increased by 20 percent according to the Chinese National Statistics Bureau. Since setting up his Chinese factory, Tony Caldeira said his Chinese employees have had wages increase 400 percent. Add to that the increasing costs in shipping, packaging, duty rates and fabric costs, and it's not surprising Chinese production has become less attractive. Read more: Will Greek crisis leave banks stronger? Last year it was cost-effective to make velvet striped cushions in Caldeira's Chinese factory, it cost 90 cents less in production per cushion. However, this year that saving shrank to 13 cents and next year the company predicts it'll cost the same to make the cushion in China and the UK. ""There are quite a few differences between my Chinese and UK workforces -- the UK employees are more productive, they can make more cushions an hour, however, they work less hours a week. ""The Chinese want to work more hours, many of them live on site and they just want to earn as much money as possible to send home to their families."" Read more: Why Europe needs a banking union . The company faces difficulties finding staff both in Britain and China, but for different reasons. ""We have been very lucky in the UK as most of our staff have been here for more than 10 years"", said Caldeira. However, this workforce is much older than the Chinese employees due to a skills shortage. ""Most of the staff here in the UK are in their 50s or 60s, although they won't like me saying that! They were taught in apprenticeships in the 1970s and 1980s, but those skills aren't being taught now."" And while the Chinese workers are younger with manufacturing and sewing machinery skills in abundance, Tony Caldeira said they don't have the same loyalty and there is a high turnover of staff. ""What you tend to find is people aren't as afraid to move jobs in the Chinese culture, a lot of workers move every year after Chinese New Year, the contracts are only 12 months, so at the end of the year they look for the best contract on the market."" Despite the rising costs in Chinese wages, the company won't be looking for another low-cost manufacturing base, for example in Vietnam or Bangladesh. ""The raw materials are manufactured in China so we'd end up shipping it over, incurring extra costs and complications."" As far as Caldeira is concerned, Britain appears to be winning this round of the great pillow fight with China. CNN's Anna Stewart contributed to this report.","Cushion maker brings production back to Britain following a steep rise in Chinese wages .

""Even for us, it's hard to understand the sudden transition from relative anonymity to worldwide attention -- both raves and ridicules, in a matter of days,"" their statement said. The filmmaker ""has a long way to go, but we are confident that he will make a full recovery,"" his family said. ""He is, and will remain, under hospital care for a number of weeks; and after that, the recovery process could take months before he is fully able to step back into his role with Invisible Children,"" it said. ""During that time, we will focus not on a speedy recovery, but a thorough one."" Russell is one of the founders of the San Diego-based nonprofit group Invisible Children, which produced the half-hour film about warlord Joseph Kony. ""Kony 2012"" skyrocketed to popularity on YouTube, propelled by thousands of posts on Twitter and Facebook, garnering nearly 85 million views since its March 5 release. The popularity of the film led to a flurry of media appearances for Russell and his fellow Invisible Children co-founders and prompted scrutiny from some who argued that the social media frenzy was too little, too late. The group has said it hopes the film and other efforts will make Kony a household name and drum up international support to halt the killings, rapes, abuses and abductions committed by his group, the Lord's Resistance Army, in central Africa. Kony, who has operated in central Africa for two decades, is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. In October, the United States sent 100 combat-equipped troops on a mission to kill or capture Kony. ""We thought a few thousand people would see the film, but in less than a week, millions of people around the world saw it. While that attention was great for raising awareness about Joseph Kony, it also brought a lot of attention to Jason -- and, because of how personal the film is, many of the attacks against it were also very personal, and Jason took them very hard,"" the statement said. Ben Keesey, the group's chief executive, issued a statement Friday confirming that Russell was hospitalized for ""exhaustion, dehydration and malnutrition."" ""The past two weeks have taken a severe emotional toll on all of us, Jason especially, and that toll manifested itself in an unfortunate incident yesterday,"" Keesey said.

"Jersey City, New Jersey (CNN) -- It all began simply: A hand-scrawled sign on a lamp post that read, ""Want to volunteer? Meet at City Hall at noon."" Then there was the Facebook page, which cobbled together 19 like-minded friends interested in helping victims of a unique weather system that meteorologists later dubbed Superstorm Sandy. ""Our initial idea was that people would find each other on this page and solve each other's problems,"" said Tiby Kantrowitz, a Jersey City resident who helped organize the effort. And then it grew. ""From 19 people it turned into 50 in about an hour-and-a-half,"" she said. Now, hundreds buzz in and out of a historic downtown mansion in Jersey City, where a neighboring church donated the building to be used as the group's improvised headquarters. First Irene now Sandy . Born out of what many described as a scarcity of local information and services in the storm's immediate aftermath, the Barrow Mansion is now a hive of volunteer activity that federal agencies like FEMA have looked to for partners. ""We all came together and joined our efforts,"" said Candice Osborne, a local resident who helped organize relief after Sandy's October 29 landfall. Coordinated virtually all by social media, the once fledgling effort has burgeoned into a full-scale relief operation that delivers more than 250 meals per day, as well as clothing and cleaning supplies to storm-battered residents. The group also cleans out flood-soaked apartments, while dispatching scout teams to check on the elderly and disabled. ""It's been pretty incredible,"" said Osborne. Finding joy among the wreckage: Family photos returned post-Sandy . Pulling an iPhone from her pocket, she then thumbed across its cracked screen and opened a Facebook app to give a sense of how the delivery process works. A request flashed on screen. Holed up in his stormed-battered home, a Facebook user had asked for dog food and towels ""from the volunteer network you are coordinating, if that is possible."" ""On it!"" Osborne replied, dispatching volunteers to the man's address, while tallying the appeal and recording her volunteers' names in the group's growing database. Moments later, he wrote again. ""I don't know how to thank you. 10 minutes after my request, I had what I need. An almost magical effort."" General Honore on Sandy recovery . With government agencies stretched thin to reach those still reeling in Sandy's aftermath, a patchwork of volunteer efforts like those in Jersey City have cropped up in storm-affected communities across the Tri-State area. Forged quickly and often with little formal structure, neighborhood groups -- like the Barrow Mansion volunteers -- often prove especially effective by way of their numbers, energy and local knowledge. And at times, they offer victims their only reprieve in disaster-stricken communities. ""It's just one those beautiful heartbreaks,"" said nurse Katie Vacante, referring to how neighbors help each other in the wake of the crisis. Map: Images of destruction, recovery on the East Coast . Bounding up stairs to deliver food in local apartment buildings, Irene Barnaby shares that very sentiment. Power outages hobbled elevators across Jersey City, stranding the elderly and disabled as utility companies scrambled to restore power, making volunteer deliveries of food, water and blankets critical in those first days. ""Our first delivery was on the 17th floor,"" said the 31-year-old real estate agent. Nine floors down, a wheelchair-bound woman named Vincencia Geiss braved the cold in her powerless apartment for about a week . ""No heat. No hot water. Nothing,"" she said. ""If I had to go down (the stairs), they'd have to carry me down. And I wasn't about to be carried."" Risks of rebuilding after Sandy . The Barrow Mansion volunteers sent a nurse the following day. Though food supplies are a recurring concern. ""When we run out (of food), we go on Facebook and say 'We have an immediate need,' and within an hour we get food,"" said volunteer Yren Berry. Last week, the group received a star-powered dose of support when members of the U.S. Women's Olympic Gymnastics team swung by to pitch in and donate supplies. ""Until you're actually here helping people find sweaters and pants ... you don't realize how big of a deal it is,"" said Nastia Liukin, a gold medalist in the 2008 Olympics. Liukin -- who has more than 190,000 followers on Twitter -- then took to the micro-blogging site, asking people to send ""canned food, bread and non perishable foods to 83 Wayne St"" in Jersey City to support the relief effort. ""Hopefully if at least one of those followers came and donated that would do something,"" she said. Larger organizations like FEMA and the Red Cross have also taken note. Trying to keep the family business afloat after Sandy . ""We are working closely with these volunteer agencies,"" said Alberto Pillot, a FEMA spokesman who encouraged residents to register online for disaster assistance and contact their insurance providers. ""But housing issues are going to be the problem in the long run,"" he said. Faced with a lack of physical space for FEMA trailers and limited access to available rental apartments and hotels, the agency says it's now bent on making flood-soaked homes inhabitable as the winter weather moves in. That ""keep-'em-in-their-homes"" strategy likely means that the man-power behind volunteer efforts will continue to be needed as temperatures drop. Yet as national interest wanes and volunteers return to their own jobs and families, the resolve of relief efforts in places like Jersey City will likely be tested. As of Tuesday, more than 18,000 homes were still in the dark across the region.

"(CNN) -- ""We are not animals, we are on a whole different level to that."" So claims Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who describes himself as ""many things,"" including a writer, doctor, a nuclear physicist, and a theoretical philosopher, but also assumes the more presumptuous role of guru and spiritual teacher, even prophet. If you've heard anything about ""The Master,"" Paul Thomas Anderson's long-awaited follow up to the magnificent ""There Will Be Blood,"" you will know that Dodd is reportedly based on sci-fi novelist and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Hoffman suggests someone more professorial than preacher: an Old World sophisticate with a New World faith in scientific methodology; charismatic, kindly, even utopian, but a charlatan whether he admits it to himself or not. He steadfastly believes in a better world, a higher calling, just so long as it gravitates around him (and always has). Ironically, ""The Master"" doesn't. Dodd is by some stretch the secondary role in the film. The protagonist is one Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), an Everyman of an especially disheveled, even wretched sort, a lost soul and a drifter who serves in the Navy during World War II and can't get his act together once the war is over. Phoenix looks skinnier and more gaunt than in his last film, when he played a grotesque, creatively exhausted version of himself in the faux-documentary ""I'm Still Here."" That was two years ago, and one reason to celebrate ""The Master"" is simply because it gives us another chance to marvel at this superb actor. His hair flecked with gray, sneery and sinewy, Phoenix resembles Montgomery Clift and John Garfield: postwar stars who embodied the anxieties and alienation of the returning GIs in male melodramas tinged in varying shades of noir. Freddie is a ball of nervous energy, agitated and intense, so bottled up with sexual frustration he's ready to pop. He funnels his aggravation into the manufacture of hooch, lovingly concocted from diesel fuel, or paint thinner, or photo chemicals, and imbibed at your own risk. A stowaway on Dodd's borrowed pleasure steamer, Freddie intrigues the older man: he's the savage beast, a test case for his theories of psychological and spiritual advancement. But there's more to it than that. Lancaster shares Quell's taste for raw alcohol. They are drinking buddies as well as doctor and patient, master and servant, messiah and acolyte ... perhaps even soul mates. Their relationship disturbs and perplexes Dodd's loyal disciples, including his formidable wife (Amy Adams), who considers Freddie beyond saving but fears that her husband could go the other way. Over the course of several years each man will disappoint the other, yet they struggle to sever whatever it is that binds them. The most classically minded of America's young filmmakers, and the most prodigious, Anderson draws on John Huston and Elia Kazan, Fred Zinnemann's ""From Here to Eternity"" and George Stevens' ""A Place in the Sun."" Even more than in ""There Will Be Blood,"" ""The Master"" demonstrates a remarkable lucidity and assurance. Who knows? It may prove to be one of the last movies ever shot and shown on 70mm, but Anderson doesn't go in for epic vistas or the proverbial cast of thousands. The camerawork is artfully composed -- each frame designed with intelligence and care -- but also fluid and self-effacing. It's a long movie, but one that feels cut to the bone. Anderson makes his points so succinctly, and with such subtlety, not a few viewers at the Toronto International Film Festival admitted they felt it would require a second viewing to catch up with it. Fans of this director -- who has previously gone in for more flamboyant gestures -- may even feel a little disappointed. There's nothing quite so grandstanding as Daniel Day Lewis's infamous milkshake scene, no oil rigs bursting into flame and frogs don't fall from the sky. But still, this film examines a not dissimilar dynamic to the ""There Will Be Blood"" love-hate between the priest and the killer, and imbues it with greater sensitivity and depth. Where Day Lewis's Daniel Plainview thirsted for black gold, Freddie Quell has a far different and more reasonable hunger: for love, and peace, just enough to get through this world straight. Far and away the best American movie unveiled at TIFF, ""The Master"" also has Weinstein muscle in its marketing. It's still five months to Oscar night, but it will be a surprise if this doesn't earn nominations across the board, with Phoenix a front-runner for best actor and Hoffman just a step behind him. In the end it may not have the emotional uplift the Academy or a popular mainstream audience craves, but make no mistake, this is an enthralling drama about a peculiarly American restlessness, and the striving for insight and grace.","Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix play characters with a complex relationship .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Billionaire Warren Buffett has been thinking about the inequities in the U.S. tax system at least since June 2007. I know this because, during PBS' Democratic presidential debate in which I served on a panel of journalists, I asked the eight Democrats, including Barack Obama, what they thought of comments Buffett had made about the unfairness of a tax system where his secretary paid a higher percentage of her income in taxes than he did. I asked Obama if he agreed with Buffett that the rich weren't paying their fair share, and what he would do about it. ""There's no doubt that the tax system has been skewed, "" Obama answered. ""But I think this goes to a broader question, and that is, are we willing to make the investments in genuine equal opportunity in this country? ""People aren't looking for charity, and one of the distressing things sometimes when we have a conversation about race in America is that we talk about welfare and we talk about poverty, but what people really want is fairness,"" he said. ""They want people paying their fair share of taxes."" I'll co-sign the last part. People should pay their fair share, and that clearly isn't happening. It's true that, at the macro level, the wealthiest people collectively pay most of the taxes in this country. But it's also true that, at the micro level, individual taxpayers in the upper income brackets often take advantage of tax laws that allow them to pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than everyday Americans. This doesn't make the wealthy bad people. But it does make for a bad system. It's no wonder that public opinion polls consistently show that Americans want the rich to pay more. This week, a Gallup Poll found that 70% of respondents favor raising taxes on some corporations by eliminating certain tax deductions and 66% favor increasing income taxes on individuals earning at least $200,000 a year and families earning at least $250,000. Now, under what it is being called the Buffett Rule, the White House wants to give people what they want. Framing it as an attempt at deficit reduction, the administration is proposing a new minimum rate for people earning more than $1 million a year, all to help make sure they pay at least the same percentage of their income as middle-class Americans. Predictably, conservatives reacted with howls of protest and accused Obama of engaging in class warfare. Obama responded, ""This is not class warfare. It's math."" Actually, it's neither. It's election year gimmickry that stands no chance of going anywhere with a Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Obama knows that, and that's why he considers it safe to propose such a plan now rather than in the first half of his administration when the House was in the hands of Democrats. Why didn't he propose it then? I think it's because it might actually have become law, and then the Democrats would have owned this new tax policy and have had to answer to voters in future elections. This way, Obama gets to excite the base in time for his re-election campaign with a proposal that won't go anywhere, without having to pay a political price. As for the Buffett Rule itself, it isn't a bad idea. But it isn't a particularly good one either. The current system, the one Buffett complains about, is inequitable. But the Obama plan would just flip the inequity so the wealthy pay more. We would go from overburdening the middle class to putting the burden on the rich. That would preserve the progressive tax rates, but it wouldn't be progress. The answer lies in a third way: a fairer, flatter tax that lets all Americans pay the same percentage of their income in taxes. Maybe it would be 15%. Or 17%. Or 20%. The specifics aren't as important as the concept. About 15 or 20 years ago, you could hear support for that idea from conservative Republicans like the late Jack Kemp, the former congressman and 1996 GOP vice presidential nominee, and billionaire Steve Forbes, who ran for president in 1996 and 2000. Fiscal conservatives liked a flat tax because they thought it was wrong to punish overachievers who earn a lot of money with confiscatory tax rates, and they saw it as a way of making the tax system more equitable. Conservatives were right back then. Yet, they're wrong now to defend the current system. The White House doesn't have the right solution. But there is no point in denying the problem. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: Gallup Poll finds majority favor raising taxes on corporations and the rich .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The latest photos of notorious killer Charles Manson have been released by the California Department of Corrections, one week before his next parole hearing. At the request of CNN, the department provided two photographs of Manson taken in June at the state prison in Corcoran, California. They show Manson, 77, with long, flowing gray hair, long beard and mustache. Photos are taken of prisoners when they are transferred to other prisons or medical facilities or, in the case of Manson, when an inmate's appearance changes. ""He looks a lot different,"" department of corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton said. The last prison photo of Manson was released three years ago and showed Manson with the top of his head shaved. One distinguishing mark remains in the recent photos, a swastika tattoo on Manson's forehead. A parole hearing is scheduled April 11 for Manson, who was initially sentenced to death for the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and six others by a group of his followers as part of what prosecutors said was an attempt to incite a race war. His death sentence was changed to life in prison after California's death penalty was overturned for a period during the 1970s. Manson may choose not to attend the hearing. The last time he appeared at his parole hearing was 15 years ago. He has been denied parole 11 times. Manson has not been a model inmate. A prosecutor who handled Manson's parole hearings told CNN in 2009 that Manson had a ""laundry list of violations in prison."" In the past five years, Manson was punished for threatening a peace officer and for possession of a weapon, the latter happening in October when Manson was found with a sharpened pen, Thornton said. Manson received notoriety when he was found to be in possession of a contraband cell phone â€” twice â€” the latest in January 2011. That incident is still under investigation. Prison officials said they tracked phone numbers in California, Oregon and Maine.","Manson was sentenced in 1969 killing of Sharon Tate, others .

"(CNN) -- It is the world's rarest whale and one of its rarest mammals. Almost a thing of legend, scientists have never seen a spade-toothed beaked whale alive and, until recently, only had limited skeletal evidence they existed. So rare is the species that when a pair of dead whales washed up on a New Zealand beach in late 2010, scientists didn't even know what they had. But now they do ... and they're a bit giddy. ""It was a bit like finding the holy grail,"" said Anton van Helden, the collection manager of marine mammals at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. He's one of the co-authors of a paper published this week in the journal ""Current Biology"" documenting the discovery. Another co-author, Rochelle Constantine with the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Auckland, made the discovery in 2011 while testing tissue samples from the whales with colleague Kirsten Thompson. ""When she showed me the result we were both a bit stunned,"" Constantine said. ""We re-ran the sample again to make sure, even though the DNA clearly showed it was a spade-toothed beaked whale."" The results were stunning because only three partial specimens of the species were known to exist -- two collected in New Zealand in 1872 and in the 1950s and a third found on Robinson Crusoe Island off the coast of Chile in 1986. The spade-toothed beaked whale looks similar to a large black, white and gray dolphin with its long pointed snout. Scientists believe they grow to be about 17 feet long. Adult males have large exposed teeth as the name suggests. Mistaken for a Gray's beaked whale after their discovery, the adult female and juvenile male were buried near where they were found on Opape Beach. Scientists were anxious to recover the remains and did in early 2012. ""We now have collected the only complete specimen in the world of this rarest of whales,"" van Helden said. ""Sadly the head of the adult female had washed away through beach erosion."" Still, the recovery of the remains is a bonanza for scientists who study cetaceans. ""Yes, the discovery is indeed most exciting,"" said geology professor Ewan Fordyce, who studies the evolution of whales and dolphins at University of Otago but who was not involved in the research. ""Now we have an idea of the appearance and size of the species."" Its lifestyle and habits are another story -- not surprising for a species researchers have never seen alive. Scientists can only guess based on what they know about other beaked whales, which are often boat-shy, spend little time at the surface and dive to depths of 6,600 feet (about 2,000 meters), according to van Helden. They probably dine on squid. Yet, scientists are excited by the challenge. ""This is the species of whale that we know the least about in the world,"" Constantine said. ""It has never been seen before, as far as we know, and for the first time we have an idea of what it looks like.""","The spade-toothed beaked whale is rarest of whales .

"(CNN) -- To those of my fellow evangelicals who are on the religious right, please, stop your fake trumpeting of biblical values if you're going to run roughshod over your biblical convictions and let your partisan views take center stage. When Mitt Romney was running for the GOP presidential nomination, many on the religious right were highly critical of his faith. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association characterized Mormonism as a cult. But Billy Graham's association scrubbed that view from its website in the wake of the Rev. Graham meeting with Romney. And at least one prominent Southern Baptist leader who called Mormonism a cult has put that aside in order to endorse the Republican nominee. Billy Graham's group removes Mormon cult reference from website after Romney . Graham, ""America's pastor,"" has run full-page ads in national newspapers like the Washington Post and USA Today that are thinly veiled endorsements of Romney. In them, he shows he has forgotten big portions of biblical teaching. The ads read: ""I believe it is vitally important that we cast our ballots for candidates who base their decisions on biblical principles and support the nation of Israel. I urge you to vote for those who protect the sanctity of life and support the biblical definition of marriage between a man and a woman."" In a similar full-page ad that ran in Ohio's Columbus Dispatch on Sunday, Graham said: ""We are at a crossroads and there are profound moral issues at stake. ... Please join me in praying for America, that we will turn out hearts back toward God."" Graham is urging Americans to vote for candidates who base their decisions on ""biblical principles,"" ""support the nation of Israel,"" ""protect the sanctity of life,"" and ""support the biblical definition of marriage between a man and a woman."" That's it. Nothing else. The teachings of Jesus Christ are filled with examples of him helping the needy, feeding the hungry, healing the sick and wounded, and taking the haves to task for ignoring the have-nots. The Bible talks about Jesus spending his time with social outcasts and not basking in the glow of the 1%. So, Rev. Graham, why no mention of the poor, sick or needy in your newspaper ads? Graham, and so many others on the religious right, apparently want to narrow the Bible's teachings down to only abortion and same-sex marriage. Does the rest of the Bible matter, or are we to tell Bible believers that one or two issues matter more than any other? I know the history of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, as well as Graham's son Franklin, helping the needy through Samaritan's Purse. But isn't it worth mentioning and advocating these issues to our presidential candidates? I wonder how Catholic bishops and nuns feel about Graham not advocating that Bible believers cast their ballots on the issue of health care? Should Bible believers not be concerned with Rep. Paul Ryan's proposals to massively cut programs that help the poor? CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories . Should Bible believers know about the fatherhood initiative launched by President Obama to shore up families and to confront the crisis of fatherless homes? Should Bible believers be concerned about the candidates' stance on guns and gun violence? Is that not a biblical issue, Rev. Graham? Should Bible believers be concerned about who prefers to end wars across the globe? Should Bible believers vote on who is best able to tear down the `-industrial complex that is destroying this country fiscally? Should Bible believers know who is more concerned about the rich getting richer? Seriously, Rev. Graham, are these not moral issues that should be considered? What has happened over the last 30 years is the religious right has perverted the Bible to fit its narrow view of what Christians should pay attention to. Abortion and homosexuality. Nothing else matters. Well, my Bible is bigger than that. My faith is bigger than that. And my Jesus Christ cares about more than abortion and homosexuality. Please, make your case about those two issues. But don't talk to me, Rev. Graham, Franklin Graham, or any other right-wing evangelical, about the sanctity of life when you are silent about such things as Trayvon Martin being gunned down or police brutality taking the lives of innocent Americans. I refuse to think the biblical and social justice issues touted by the Revs. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Fred Shuttlesworth, Ralph Abernathy, C.T. Vivian, and countless other pastors during the civil rights movement aren't worth considering today. Support who you want, Rev. Graham, but don't dare limit the biblical values to what I can count on one hand. The Gospel according to Obama .

"(CNN) -- Tech giants Apple and Google may get an unofficial A grade when it comes to stock price, but they can only manage a D grade when it comes to sustainability. The U.S. technology companies both received the grade that would make most students wince in a new survey, published this week, that rated the sustainability performance of 2,063 global companies. The report evaluated companies according to their social, environmental and governance risks and impacts, taking into consideration human rights and supply chain labor standards among other issues . Top of the class in the Sustainability Report published by EIRIS, the British based corporate research company, is German sportswear company, Puma. Lesser known companies like Danish pharmaceutical company, Novo Nordisk, and two British rail and bus companies make it into the top ten. Puma CEO explains his company's business model . ""Despite operating in a sector at high risk for human-rights abuses, Puma has a strong environment record and demonstrates improvements in supply chain labor standards,"" the report said. The worst performers were graded E, with over 60% of mining and oil and gas producing companies including ExxonMobil and Chevron Corporation given the lowest rating. By definition fossil fuel focused companies are not able get the highest grade, but the report's authors say their grades can improve if they show greater commitment to developing cleaner alternative energy sources. The sector with the most A grades was in health care, because of the ""positive social benefits of healthcare"" and lower environmental impact, with four pharmaceutical companies in the top ten. Carlota Garcia-Manas, Head of Research at EIRIS, said environmental and ethical concerns are becoming a greater priority among many of the companies rated. ""There are signs that companies are making sustainability a priority and acknowledging its importance, not only in terms of acting as good 'corporate citizens' but also in terms of ensuring their own long-term success,"" she said. The report revealed some notable differences between companies from different regions. One fifth of UK companies scored A, followed by 12% of mainland European ones, but only 2% of U.S. companies and 1% of Asian ones received the top mark. One in five of the Asian companies surveyed received an E grade. According to EIRIS, Apple's poor grade was because of its links to suppliers in countries with human rights and labor issues, while another of titan of the corporate world, Toyota, received a C because of its leadership in developing cleaner technology vehicles.

The report found that smaller companies were generally lagging behind on sustainability -- only 24% of the 50 biggest companies surveyed had D or E grades compared to 40% across the wider sample.

They were sold to thousands of customers in 28 states and 60 foreign countries. The software covered a wide range of applications used in manufacturing, engineering, space exploration, storm water management, explosives simulation and manufacturing plant design. One of their largest customers was a former electronics engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, who pleaded guilty to copyright infringement last April.

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI has pardoned his former butler, Paolo Gabriele, weeks after he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for leaking the pope's private papers, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said. The pope visited Gabriele in prison ""in order to confirm his forgiveness and communicate in person his decision to grant Mr. Gabriele's request for pardon, thereby remitting the sentence passed against the latter,"" said a Vatican statement. ""This constitutes a paternal gesture toward a person with whom the Pope shared a relationship of daily familiarity for many years."" Gabriele was immediately released and has returned home, the statement said. ""Since he cannot resume his previous occupation or continue to live in Vatican City, the Holy See, trusting in his sincere repentance, wishes to offer him the possibility of returning to a serene family life,"" it said. Gabriele, one of the pope's closest personal assistants, was convicted in October of aggravated theft for leaking secret papers from the pontiff's personal apartment to an author who included them in a best-selling book. During the high-profile trial, Gabriele declared himself not guilty, but said he had abused the pope's trust. He asked forgiveness of the pontiff for his actions, which he said were intended to expose wrongdoing. The Holy See media office had previously indicated that Gabriele could be pardoned. He has been held in a cell in Vatican City since October. Gabriele was arrested in May, following a Vatican investigation into how the pope's private documents appeared in the book ""Sua Santita"" (""His Holiness""), by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi. The book, based on the papers, revealed claims of corruption in the church's hierarchy. At his trial, police told how they found more than 1,000 important documents among a stash of hundreds of thousands of papers in Gabriele's apartments in Vatican City and Castel Gondolfo, a town near Rome. Among them were original papers signed by Pope Benedict XVI, some of them stamped with an order for destruction, according to the journalists allowed to attend the trial. Also found in his possession were a gold nugget belonging to the pope, a signed check made out to Pope Benedict XVI for 100,000 euros and an original version of Virgil's Aeneid from 1581.

"(CNN) -- CNN iReporters documented some of the biggest global weather stories of the year, and captured some amazing photos in the process. Click through the gallery above to see some of their most compelling photographs of 2012. And if you're wondering how you might be able to capture images like this, it just so happens that CNN meteorologists Brandon Miller and Judson Jones recently joined the CNN iReport community on Facebook for a discussion on that very topic. Read their top 13 weather photography tips: . 1. Timing is everything. When it comes to weather photography on iReport, timing is everything, according to Miller. Oftentimes people will submit great weather images, ""but it's a day or two after the event. By then we have moved on to new stories,"" he said. 2. Give lightning photos visual context. Lightning photos tend to be a common subject in weather photographs, and Miller says at times they start to look similar. ""What makes a lightning photo unique is what else is in the picture. [Like] an iconic building for instance, or a harbor in Hong Kong,"" he said. But why does a building matter in a weather photo anyway? Miller says things like a building or a harbor add to the overall context of the photograph. ""It makes it easier to tell the story on TV, and relates it to the viewer."" 3. Capture drought through texture. The Midwest suffered a prolonged drought that not only stunted the growth of crops like corn and wheat, but dried out essential bodies of water, bringing parts of the Mississippi River to extremely low levels. Despite the visible signs of drought, it can be one of the hardest things to capture through photography, Jones said. The best way to convey drought is by capturing the texture, like photographing a dried up lakebed. ""Most people never see the bottom of a lake,"" he said. ""[It] puts the whole drought into perspective."" 4. Use wide angle shots. When it comes to capturing weather, it is important to see the whole picture. Miller suggests using wide angle shots to help put the photograph in context. ""Show more of the sky and not necessarily focus on what you think is important, like zooming in on a funnel cloud and ignoring the rest of the storm,"" he said. 5. Take multiple photographs. That epic weather moment can happen literally in a flash. If you want to increase your likelihood of capturing a great weather shot, you have to shoot multiple photographs, according to Jones. ""You never want to shoot only one photo,"" he said. 6. Move around. As quickly as weather changes, it also moves. Standing in one location may not be the best method when it comes to capturing a weather photograph. ""Move around and get a little bit of a different perspective,"" Jones said. Adding more perspective gives your photographs more depth and context, he explains. 7. No filters, ever. A slight change in saturation, a little color boost or Instagram-type filter on a weather photograph can totally change its meaning. Miller says to avoid adding filters when capturing weather photographs. 8. Edit with darkroom tricks only. Here is Jones' rule of thumb for editing weather photographs: ""Only do in post-production what you could have done in a darkroom,"" he said. ""Simple contrast, exposure, cropping and white balance are all you really should ever do, unless you are working on something for an art exhibit."" 9. Patience is key. Weather is dynamic, but sometimes the shot you are looking for might not happen right away. Patience is fundamental, according to Jones, who also suggests using a remote camera set-up prior to a weather event. After setting up your camera, Jones says it's all about waiting. ""Be patient. It may take awhile, but eventually you will get the strike you are looking for."" 10. Monitor storm events. If you want to capture weather photographs, Miller suggests monitoring the National Weather Service and Storm Prediction Center. ""They will provide accurate forecasts one to three days out for tornadoes, wind, hail, etc.,"" he said. 11. Don't just hold hail. Hail is a big weather event, and happens in many parts of the world. It's common for people to photograph images of themselves holding up pieces of hail, but those images don't place the storm in context. Jones says hail is great to photograph when it is in perspective of the people it is affecting. He suggests photographing hail if it damages crops or breaks windshields, for example. 12. Time-lapse away. Time-lapses are a bit trickier to create, but they are a great way of capturing the whole storm, according to Miller. ""We love time-lapses,"" he said. ""It allows us to show an entire storm unfold in a few seconds."" He says the best events in which to use time-lapse photography are snowstorms or a hurricane's passage. 13. Stay safe. Weather is dangerous, and when it comes to photographing it, Jones says it's important to be cognizant of general weather safety. ""Know your surroundings and the safest place to be,"" he said. Sometimes you don't even need to be out in the storm to capture that perfect shot. Jones suggests using a camera with a remote timer. ""I put my camera -- with a manual setting -- on a tripod... set the aperture... and focus on infinity or an object I want to be the center of [my] story,"" he said. Now get out there and put those tips to work! You can share your images in our severe weather or winter weather assignment.","CNN iReporters documented some of the biggest global weather stories of the year .

"(CNN) -- Since 1995 the Italian shoe manufacturer Geox has worked hard to ensure consumers are spared the inconvenience and embarrassment of sweaty feet. Its patented ""breathable shoe"" technology -- a combination of a membrane insole that absorbs sweat and lets it out through an outer sole filled with holes -- has turned the company into a multi-million dollar shoe empire. The idea of a sole filled with holes came to the company's founder, Mario Moretti Polegato, when he was on a business trip to Reno, Nevada, to promote his family's wine products. After the meeting Polegato decided to go for a wander in the hot Nevada Desert, and necessity turned out to be the mother of invention. As his feat quickly began to overheat Polegato decided to make holes in the bottom of his shoes. ""With my pocket knife I cut holes in the right and left part of the soles and I realized the ventilation in my shoes,"" he said. When Polegato returned to Italy he started to develop a shoe with holes in the sole that let air in and perspiration out. The design was patented and in 1995 Geox was founded with five employees; today it employs 30,000 people around the world. Scientific and technological innovation has been key to Geox's success, and the company has patented numerous new materials in rubber, leather and fabric. Each prototype is designed in Italy but to shorten delivery times the company outsources much of its manufacturing to Asia. ""We invest a lot in quality control. In every factory where we produce there is an Italian technician, a shoemaker, that controls shoe by shoe,"" said Polegato. Despite being Italy's number one shoe brand, the economic crisis has affected sales in Geox's core market. The company's distribution network is clogged up with last year's stock and orders for next season are down. Read more: Unlocking China's business potential . Polegato says the solution is to look further afield than Italy and its neighboring countries: ""Our strategy now is to invest more in some countries with economic growth, like the Asia Pacific area, Eastern Europe, India and Turkey,"" he said. Nearly seven years after Geox opened a megastore on Madison Avenue in New York City, the company is looking east to expand its empire. ""Our program now is to open 300 Geox stores in China,"" he added.","Italian shoemaker Geox specializes in creating ""breathable"" shoes and fabrics .

"Rome (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI presided over Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, delivering a homily that focused on the ""essence"" of the holiday rather than the ""commercial celebration"" it has become. ""Today Christmas has become a commercial celebration, whose bright lights hide the mystery of God's humility, which in turn calls us to humility and simplicity,"" the pope said after recalling the story of Christmas. ""Let us ask the Lord to help us see through the superficial glitter of this season, and to discover behind it the child in the stable in Bethlehem, so as to find true joy and true light."" The 84-year-old pope, presiding over his seventh mass as pontiff, also conjured up an image of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, explaining that visitors must bend down to enter its low opening, drawing a tie to what followers of Christ must do to find their faith. ""If we want to find the God who appeared as a child, then we must dismount from the high horse of our 'enlightened' reason,"" he said. ""... In this spirit let us celebrate the liturgy of the holy night, let us strip away our fixation on what is material, on what can be measured and grasped."" The pope started off Saturday's celebrations by lighting a peace candle in the window of his study during the unveiling of a larger-than-life nativity scene in St. Peter's Square. The scene, at 23 feet high and 82 feet wide, is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, according to the Vatican's news agency. Thousands poured into the square and St. Peter's Basilica ahead of the Midnight Mass, which was actually held at 10 p.m. this year. Before his homily, the aging pontiff rode down St. Peter's long aisle on a wheeled platform, waving to worshipers. Benedict will follow the Christmas Eve celebrations with his annual Christmas message ""To the City and To the World"" -- Urbi et Orbi in Latin -- on Sunday.","Benedict deplores the ""superficial glitter of this season""

"(CNN) -- Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced just days before leaving office that the Pentagon is extending some benefits to the same-sex partners of service members. Same-sex partners who sign a military ""Declaration of Domestic Partnership"" form will be eligible for several benefits, including military identification cards as dependents. This would allow them unescorted status on bases, access to commissaries, and the right to visit their partners in military hospitals. They will also be able to receive many survivor benefits, including life insurance payments. The Pentagon believes there may be 5,600 troops on active duty seeking such benefits, as well as 3,400 National Guard troops and 8,000 retirees. Marine Corps to spouse clubs: Allow same-sex members or you don't operate on base . The changes are expected to go into affect no later than October 1, 2013. The move had been expected for weeks and is widely seen as part of Panetta's effort to finish as much as he can in extending benefits to gays and lesbians before leaving the Pentagon. Facing legal limitations around the Defense of Marriage Act, some benefits will not be extended. This includes health care coverage, Pentagon officials said. ""One of the legal limitations to providing all benefits at this time is the Defense of Marriage Act, which is still the law of the land. There are certain benefits that can only be provided to spouses as defined by that law, which is now being reviewed by the United States Supreme Court,"" Panetta said in a statement. Out -- but not in . The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage as that between a man and a woman. Federal courts have ruled it unconstitutional and the Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal. Pentagon officials briefing reporters on the change also said the agency did not extend housing benefits to same sex-couples. This was due in part to feedback from troops who felt they might have problems getting military housing, which is in short supply at times. But there may also be legal issues to be resolved before such housing can be granted.

"(Mashable) -- How is new CEO Marissa Mayer going to revitalize Yahoo? By making it more like Google, the company she just left. According to AllThingsD's Kara Swisher, Mayer has instituted a few changes already at Yahoo's Sunnyvale, CA, headquarters. Among them: establishing a weekly all-hands meeting on Friday afternoons, and making all the food in its URLs Cafe, which previously priced egg white muffin sandwiches at $3.65 and teriyaki chicken paninis at $5.31, free. Of course, it's easy to say that all of this has been borrowed directly from Google, but these kinds of offerings have become standard at many Silicon Valley offices â€” the fact that Yahoo has, until now, lacked them has likely been a sore point for some of its engineers. Both Facebook and Twitter, for instance, serve up free snacks and daily catered meals to employees. They're small changes, yes, but they're likely to improve the morale of a company whose public image and internal image has deteriorated over the last seven years. In addition to the new meeting and food policy, Swisher reports that Mayer is also planning ""major changes"" to workspaces ""to make [them] more collaborative and cool,"" and improving the swag offered in its stores. She's also pushing to improve Yahoo's core products, including e-mail, Flickr and search. Several of Swisher's sources said that ""big splash tech or product deals... perhaps via an acquisition"" may be announced ""in the days ahead.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Adele thanked her doctors ""who brought my voice back"" as she accepted one of six Grammy awards Sunday night, and she later proved their work was true with a strong vocal performance. The 23-year-old British songstress was crying by the time she accepted her sixth award -- for the most prized album of the year Grammy. ""I just first want to say 'Mom, girl did good,'"" Adele said. ""It's been the most life-changing year,"" she said. Adele, who underwent surgery for ""recurrent vocal cord hemorrhage"" in November, sang ""Rolling In The Deep,"" ending speculation about her recovery. Adele enjoyed a loud and long standing ovation from the packed Staples Centers audience after her strong delivery.

She also won Grammys for record of the year, best pop solo performance, best short form music video and best pop vocal album for ""21."" Chris Brown's career rehabilitation from his arrest for the beating of his then-girlfriend Rihanna just before the 2009 Grammys took another step forward with a Grammy win and two performances Sunday. ""We got one!"" the 22-year-old Brown said during a short acceptance speech after winning a Grammy for best R&B album. Rihanna was given her turn to perform during the same hour, collaborating with Coldplay on stage. The Beach Boys, celebrating their 50th anniversary as a group, performed together publicly for the first time in two decades, joined on stage by Foster The People and Maroon 5.

One-time Beach Boy Glen Campbell watched from near the stage, and later performed in his own Grammys tribute. Campbell, 75, launched his ""Goodbye Tour"" last year after revealing he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Campbell was joined by current Grammy nominees Blake Shelton and The Band Perry for a live performance as part of a tribute to Campbell, a five-time Grammy winner. ""Thank y'all so much,"" Campbell said, after a rousing rendition of ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" during which he showed no sign of disability.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's admiration for Myanmar democracy activist and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi was hard to miss during her visit to Suu Kyi's home in Yangon. They stood together, hands clasped and all smiles -- and even shared a hug -- at a news conference Friday on Suu Kyi's porch before international journalists. ""I felt like I had known her for years,"" Clinton told CNN's Jill Dougherty on her second day of meeting with Suu Kyi, ""because of all of the information I had about her and the interactions that friends of mine had about her that carried messages back and forth."" But Clinton's enthusiasm on the last day of her historic visit to Myanmar seemed to extend beyond her personal admiration for the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who, until her release in November 2010, spent nearly 20 years under house arrest imposed by the country's regime -- one that now appears to be taking steps in the direction of democracy. Clinton sees signs that the country, ruled by a military junta for almost 50 years and which in the past cooperated with North Korea in missile technology, may genuinely be opening up -- via its economy. ""They asked that I personally follow through with a request for the World Bank to send an assessment team, that we offer technical advice about how they can and should reform their economy,"" Clinton told CNN. But the military ties with North Korea have to go if Myanmar -- called Burma by opponents of the regime and by U.S. officials -- wants deeper political and economic cooperation with Washington and with nearby democracies, such as ""South Korea, which has a great deal to offer in terms of development assistance,"" Clinton said. ""Burma"" was the name the country used decades ago, before the military junta took control and changed it to ""Myanmar."" As North Korea still looms in the background, the Obama administration is not ending sanctions and is not making any abrupt changes in policy. ""We've made it clear that it would be difficult for us to pursue our engagement unless that relationship was once and for all ended."" The message ""had a receptive audience,"" Clinton said. That receptiveness may partly be the result of intense diplomatic contact between the two countries preceding Clinton's visit. ""We've had about 20 or more high-level visits from our assistant secretary, our special representative and others. They have fanned out across the country, meeting with all kinds of people,"" Clinton said. Suu Kyi, the country's leading activist for democratic reform, was instrumental in helping to gauge the U.S. diplomatic approach, Clinton said. ""She is someone who we talk to and rely on about policy advice, and certainly we were very gratified that she encouraged us to engage, encouraged my trip."" Suu Kyi, who plans to run for parliament, expressed her hopes for more solid democratic reforms thanks to U.S. efforts. ""Because of this engagement, I think our way ahead will be clearer and we will be able to trust that the process of democratization will go forward,"" she told journalists. The junta has ruled Burma since 1962. Thein Sein became president in March after a controversial election, and the new government freed dozens of political prisoners in October. The new government has shown encouraging signs of reform and has released some political prisoners, but Suu Kyi said that all such prisoners must be released and that no one should be arrested for their beliefs. ""All hostilities must cease in this country,"" she said. The road to democracy in Myanmar is closer than before, but there is still a ways to go, she added. ""We are not on that road yet, but we hope to get there as soon as possible with the help and understanding of our friends,"" she said. Clinton became the first U.S. secretary of state to visit the country in 50 years, and her visit was made possible by the nation's unexpected steps toward democratic reform. The trip, the White House said, indicates that the time could be right for the two nations to forge a new relationship. Still, Myanmar is far from a democracy, and skepticism exists on both sides. Journalists in the country enjoy new freedoms, but their work remains heavily regulated. Ethnic violence still occurs against Myanmar's minorities, and human rights groups estimate that more than 1,500 political prisoners are still detained. For its part, Myanmar offered a cordial welcome to Clinton, but the visit with officials was low-key. ""We are at the very beginning,"" Clinton told CNN. ""Where we will be in one year, five years or 10, I can't really predict."" The secretary of state ended her visit to Myanmar on Friday and is on her way back to the United States.","NEW: Myanmar must end North Korea military ties to get U.S. cooperation, she says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The administration's top counterterrorism adviser said Thursday he was aware of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques that critics describe as torture while serving as a top official at the agency but did nothing to stop them because he had no oversight role. ""I did not take steps to stop the CIA use of those techniques,"" John Brennan told his Senate confirmation hearing. Brennan was nominated by President Barack Obama to lead the spy agency after Gen. David Petraeus resigned from the job over an extramarital affair. The issue was controversial in the administration of former President George W. Bush in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In answering questions about the techniques, Brennan acknowledged that he knew another part of the agency was carrying out a directive from the Bush administration. Five things we learned from John Brennan's confirmation hearing . ""I had awareness that the agency was being asked to do it; I was aware that the agency was moving ahead on it,"" he told the Senate Intelligence Committee, adding that he was not involved in managing it. At the time, Brennan was the CIA's deputy executive director. On the same issue, Brennan said a committee report on the interrogation techniques contained ""disturbing"" information that raised questions about whether he knew what really happened. The 6,000-page report took six years to compile, and Brennan said he read the 300-page executive summary before Thursday's hearing. ""Now I have to determine what the truth is,"" he said. ""I do not know what the truth is."" Under persistent questioning by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, Brennan pledged that waterboarding would never be used under his direction, but he refused to label it torture. On the issue of drone strikes on terrorist targets abroad, Brennan defended the 2011 killing of Yemeni-American Anwar al-Awlaki as part of the war against al Qaeda. Brennan said al-Awlaki's involvement in efforts to kill Americans made him a legitimate military target. Under prodding from committee Chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, Brennan confirmed a connection between al-Awlaki and Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who failed in his attempt to detonate an explosive in his underwear as his Northwest Airlines flight approached Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009. However, Brennan offered no details of the connection, and noted al-Awlaki's role as a propagandist for al-Qaeda who fomented anti-American sentiments via the Internet. The hearing was temporarily halted at the start when protesters repeatedly interrupted Brennan's opening statement. Some waved signs accusing him of war crimes because of the drone attacks. Feinstein ordered the room cleared of spectators and told security officers to prevent the re-entry of protesters from Code Pink, which describes itself as a women-initiated group for peace and social justice. Brennan is considered to be behind the administration's dramatic rise in the use of drones against terrorist suspects. Several strikes have killed Americans, notably al-Awlaki. Opinion: Bring drones out of the shadows . Brennan defended the drone program, saying that Obama ""insisted that any actions we take will be legally grounded, will be thoroughly anchored in intelligence, will have the appropriate review process, approval process before any action is contemplated, including those actions that might involve the use of lethal force."" ""My role as the president's counterterrorism adviser was to help to orchestrate this effort over the past four years to ensure, again, that any actions we take fully comport with our law and meet the standards that I think this committee and the American people expect of us as far as taking actions we need to protect the American people, but at the same time ensuring that we do everything possible before we need to resort to lethal force,"" he said. An unclassified outline of the administration's policy given last summer to Congress indicated that the government could use lethal force against an American overseas if the person was a senior operational leader of al Qaeda or one of its affiliates and an attack was imminent. The Senate Intelligence Committee received a classified document on Thursday that seeks to justify the administration's policy of targeting Americans overseas via drone attacks, a congressional aide told CNN. The document was demanded by lawmakers, mainly Democrats concerned about secrecy in national security decision making, before Brennan's hearing. It outlines the Justice Department's legal rationale for the policy of using lethal force against U.S. citizens fighting on behalf of terrorist groups. CNN Explains: U.S. drones . According to an official who spoke on the condition of not being identified, Obama decided to turn over the legal opinion because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy. On Thursday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, sent a letter to Obama calling on him to share with the committee any legal memos on the targeted killings of Americans abroad. ""The deliberate killing of a United States citizen pursuant to a targeted operation authorized or aided by our Government raises significant constitutional and legal concerns that fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the Committee,"" they wrote. One of the questions the committee submitted to Brennan in advance of the hearing asked how it was determined that an individual was associated with al Qaeda and that a threat was imminent. Brennan responded in writing that such decisions were made on a ""case-by-case basis"" in a process involving other agencies. The White House said this week that questions on the matter have been weighed against legal concerns and discussed publicly. The Supreme Court has held that the military may use force against an American who is part of enemy forces. Still civil liberties and other groups want more answers. Amnesty International said Congress should grill Brennan on his claim that the Obama administration's drone strikes are ""conducted in full compliance with the law."" Opinion: John Brennan, Obama's counterterrorist . Other controversies at hand . Brennan's chances to lead the CIA at the start of Obama's first term were scuttled by questions about the enhanced interrogations of terrorist suspects. At Thursday's hearing, Brennan said he had raised objections with colleagues to the enhanced interrogation techniques, but denied any role in managing or enabling their use. Asked if the techniques had yielded intelligence that saved lives, Brennan did not answer directly. Instead, he repeated his insistence that such techniques would never be used under his watch. Senate lawmakers also asked about Brennan's role in administration leaks about covert operations, including a foiled al Qaeda bomb plot in Yemen involving a mole. He denied any wrongdoing, saying that he had gotten involved only after the leaks became public and that he tried to stem a ""hemorrhaging"" of leaked information in the matter. Brennan acknowledged in his written responses to committee questions that he voluntarily was interviewed by prosecutors about two investigations. He said in both cases his counsel told him he was being interviewed as a witness, not a target. Report: Numerous countries involved in CIA interrogation programs . A powerful figure at White House . As CIA director, Brennan would report to James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. But he would also have a direct path to the president, talking to him on the phone or briefing him personally.

"(EW.com) -- Fox is pulling ""Ben and Kate"" from its schedule. Yes, both of them! The move comes after ABC blinked first, yesterday yanking its lowest-rated Tuesday comedy, ""Don't Trust the Bâ€”- in Apt. 23.,"" and doubling down on ""Happy Endings."" Now Fox is shuffling its Tuesday comedy block, removing Ben and Kate and instead airing two episodes of ""Raising Hope"" starting next week. Fox says the remaining ""Ben and Kate"" episodes will air at some point (there are six left). Given ""Ben and Kate's"" ratings, the move wasn't a surprise (if anything, some were shocked the show received an order for additional episodes last fall). This isn't one of those decisions where you say, ""The network didn't give it a chance."" 'Mad Men' season 6 premiere: April 7 . Doubling up on ""Hope"" through February will make room for the return of Hell's Kitchen, which will now launch March 12 at 8 p.m. and lead into ""New Girl"" and ""The Mindy Project."" The network emphasized these changes should not be taken as a bad sign for Hope, noting they plan to give the comedy a one-hour season finale following American Idol on Thursday, March 28. 'New Girl' react: Murder, he wrote? Even when including seven days of DVR playback, ""Ben and Kate"" averages only 3.1 million viewers and a 1.5 rating this season.

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress went beyond the edge of the fiscal cliff to get a deal done in back-to-back, late-night sessions to avert a financial crisis, or at least to put it off for a couple months. Here are winners and losers in the deal: . Winners . Vice President Joe Biden: This might not have been the ""Big f***ing deal"" that he proclaimed the passage of Obamacare to be, but it was a pretty big deal. Biden used his years of experience cutting deals in the Senate to work out a compromise with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He used the same playbook in the first extension of the Bush-era tax cuts in 2010 and the debt ceiling fight in 2011, walking through the proposal with progressives in the Senate and then the House to bring them in line. Then he went and got a sandwich. Biden hasn't ruled out a run for the White House when Obama's second term is up and his role in this deal makes a President Biden believable. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: He found the ""dance partner"" he was looking for in Biden and skillfully worked behind the scenes with the vice president to broker a deal that got overwhelming Republican support in the Senate. It's too early to tell whether McConnell will pay the price with hard-line conservatives at home in Kentucky who have already shown that they can oust Senate incumbents who anger them by working with Democrats. No real Republican opponent has emerged in his re-election race in 2014 but they mobilized two years ago to elect Rand Paul to the Senate over McConnell's hand-picked candidate. Inside the deal . President Barack Obama: White House insiders say he learned lessons in his first term and would be a tougher negotiator in his second. He didn't get the big deal that he set out for and some progressives think that he gave too much away, but getting Republican votes to raise taxes on the wealthy is significant. And he did pick Biden to be his vice president. The wealthy: Despite higher taxes, it could have been a lot worse. The unemployed: Another year of benefits for those actively looking for work. Five things to know about the fiscal cliff . Losers . The employed: The two-year payroll tax holiday is over, so take-home pay will go down -- around $2,000 less a year for the average wage earner as the rate went from 4.2% to 6.2%. But ending the tax holiday will add about $120 billion to federal coffers. House Speaker John Boehner: He had to pull his ""Plan B"" back from the floor when it became clear that he didn't have the Republican votes for passage and then had to sit back and watch McConnell make a deal with Biden. On Tuesday, he was reduced to dodging microphones and listening to conservative members vent about the deal that was forced on them. While weakened, Boehner's standing appears safe, though. Really, who would want this job? House Republicans: Could their reputation get any worse? First, they publicly threaten the deal passed by the Senate to up the anxiety for the nation on New Year's Day. And then they cave when the votes to add spending cuts to that proposal never materialized. Finally, they tell Superstorm Sandy victims waiting for more help from Washington to wait longer -- pushing back a vote on an aid package. A grand bargain: Have you seen anything that makes you think these guys get a long-term deal done to address the real crisis on the debt ceiling a few more weeks down the road? The can: That poor sucker gets a couple more dents and a few more scuffs as it gets kicked down the road again. iReport: What's your message for Washington?","Biden and McConnell lauded for their ability to work together on deal .

"(CNN) -- European Union leaders for the first time in the bloc's history agreed to a cut in spending as they thrashed out a seven-year budget Friday in marathon talks in Brussels, Belgium. The deal, which covers the period from 2014 to 2020, will limit actual EU spending to â‚¬908 billion ($1.2 trillion), with a spending ceiling of 959 billion euros. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, had initially proposed a 5% increase to its budget for the seven-year period, to about â‚¬1 trillion ($1.4 trillion). European Council President Herman Van Rompuy hailed the deal reached Friday -- after talks he said were the longest of his presidency -- as balanced and oriented toward future competitiveness and growth. ""It was no easy task,"" he said, ""but it was worth working for."" The Multiannual Financial Framework, as the seven-year budget is known, must still be approved by the European Parliament. The compromise agreement is not the perfect deal for all 27 EU member states, Van Rompuy said, but it is realistic and shows that European leaders are facing up to their responsibilities at a time of economic difficulties across the region. The focus of the budget is on growth and jobs, he said, with funding directed toward such areas as education, research and development, tackling youth unemployment and improving transport networks. It also maintains development aid for the poorest nations of the world, Van Rompuy said, and will allow the EU to remain engaged with vital global issues such as climate change and nuclear safety. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the body would have preferred an outcome closer to the original proposal it put forward. But, he said, ""It must recognize that the political deal made now was the highest possible that heads of government could reach."" After difficult negotiations, the budget is ""not perfect but offers a basis for negotiations with the European Parliament,"" he said. ""It was a marathon but it was a marathon for very important results."" A previous summit in November collapsed without a deal amid deep divisions over EU spending at a time of wide austerity. The budget wrangling comes as the continent struggles with serious economic challenges that have reverberated globally. The European Union's yearly spending amounts to about 1% of the region's annual economic output. Most funding comes from member-state contributions. Germany is the largest contributor, providing about 20% of the total budget. Other net contributors include Britain, France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. Britain was among the nations pushing for cuts to spending, with Prime Minister David Cameron insisting that the EU ""should not be immune from the sorts of pressures that we have had to reduce spending, find efficiencies and make sure that we spend money wisely."" France was keen to protect the budget for agriculture, which was spared further cuts in the new deal. CNN's Kendra Wates contributed to this report.","EU leaders agree to limit spending to â‚¬908 billion ($1.2 trillion) in a 7-year budget deal .

"(CNN) -- Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch showed just why she's the Olympic champion by claiming victory at the women's super-combined event at the World Ski Championships in Austria Friday. The 28-year-old, who started in fourth position after the opening downhill run, made up the 0.20 second deficit before clocking a fastest time of two minutes 39.92 seconds. Hoefl-Riesch edged out Slovenia's Tina Maze with home favorite Nicole Hosp pulling off the fastest slalom run to claim bronze, despite finishing a second off the leader. Vonn faces races against time . ""I arrived here hoping for a medal, no matter what color,"" Hoefl-Riesch told reporters. ""I've been lacking confidence this winter. I wasn't favorite coming here and I didn't really feel comfortable in today's slalom. ""Knowing Tina's form, I said to myself, 'Okay, second place is already a very good result'. Now I am extremely happy."" The home support at Schladming had hoped defending world champion Anna Fenninger would shine on the big stage, but the 23-year-old failed to make one gate high up the course. ""I wanted to take risks but it can happen that you straddle a gate,"" Fenninger told reporters. ""It can also happen if I don't take any risks. Straddling is just a timing problem, it's hard to navigate, and even more so if you don't train slalom often."" Ski champ Lindsey Vonn injures knee . Slovenia's Maze, who clinched her second medal and 20th podium of the season following her gold in the Super G, was left frustrated with her performance.

"FLORES, Guatemala (CNN) -- In the rain forests of Central America grows the nutrient-rich Maya nut. The marble-sized seed can be prepared to taste like mashed potatoes, chocolate or coffee. To those who stumble upon the nuts on the ground, they're free for the taking. Erika Vohman's Equilibrium Fund teaches women how to reap the benefits of the Maya nut. The problem, however, is that many people living in areas where the Maya nut grows abundantly don't know about it. Erika Vohman is trying to change that -- and improve rain forest conservation and women's status in the process. ""People are living right there, in extreme poverty, not even eating more than one meal a day and there's Maya nut lying all around,"" Vohman said. ""They don't eat it because they don't know."" Vohman has traveled to Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador, conducting workshops that teach women how to harvest, prepare and cook or dry the prolific seeds into tasty, hearty foods. The 45-year-old biologist first encountered the Maya nut while visiting rural Guatemala a decade ago for an animal rescue effort. An indigenous colleague told her of the native resource, once an essential food staple of his Mayan ancestors; the civilization had widely cultivated the large tropical rain forest tree, the Brosimum alicastrum, that produces the Maya nut. That colleague prepared a Maya nut soup for Vohman and she found it delicious. Having watched impoverished Guatemalan communities clear rain forests to plant food, it struck Vohman that the key for uplifting Central American communities was to help them return to their roots. She subsequently attended graduate school and learned how she could help these populations make the most of Maya nut -- a resource that didn't require forest destruction for planting. In 2001, Vohman created The Equilibrium Fund to help alleviate poverty, malnutrition and deforestation by teaching communities about their native Maya nut forests. Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes . Far-reaching benefits of the Maya nut . With one tree able to produce as much as 400 pounds of food a year, using the Maya nut prevents rain forest clear-cutting to harvest other foods and increases populations' food supplies. Dried, the Maya nut can be stored for up to five years -- a lifeline for regions with frequent drought. The Maya nut has high levels of nutrients including protein, calcium, fiber, iron and vitamins A, E, C and B. ""For some reason, people have stopped eating this food, which is one of the most nutritious foods you can get,"" Vohman said. It is also less susceptible to climate changes than the crops that had been brought in to replace it. In the rural village of Versalles, Nicaragua, women gather and cook the Maya nuts into pancakes, cookies, salads, soup and shakes that feed their community year-round. It is one of 700 communities so far where ""The Maya Nut Revolution,"" as it has come to be known, has taken hold.  Watch how the Maya nut is transforming communities in Central America » . ""These women are responsible for raising the next generation,"" Vohman said. ""If a woman's not educated and doesn't have access to any job opportunities, it makes it really hard. Our workshops [help them] acquire the skills and knowledge to feed their families and better their lives."" Training rural women about the Maya nut has made them champions of rain forest conservation and reforestation, as well as entrepreneurs who turn Maya nut products into income. Training empowers women to educate others in neighboring communities, subsequently spreading the wealth.  Watch women use the Maya nut in their workshops with Vohman » . The Equilibrium Fund has taught more than 10,000 women across five countries about Maya nut for food and income. More than 800,000 Maya nut trees have been planted for rain forest conservation. The group has found that where the Maya nut tree disappears, 50 to 80 percent of local species are wiped out in six months to a year. Seeing the widespread effect of her group's endeavors keeps Vohman going. ""It's impacting gender equality. That's a huge paradigm shift,"" she said. ""We're having an impact on the environment, an economic impact and also motivating reforestation. It's really amazing."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- New Jersey, one of the bluest states and where President Barack Obama won 58.3% of the vote in November's presidential election, is poised to re-elect Chris Christie, the state's incumbent Republican governor, this fall. Having been deeply engaged in New Jersey politics since his youth, Christie seems to relish his role as one of the nation's most powerful and prominent governors. Yet many are wondering whether Christie's popularity in the Garden State has come at the expense of his presidential prospects. Mitt Romney, for example, decided not to run for re-election as governor of Massachusetts in the 2006 race, sensing that the steps he'd need to take to achieve political success in his left-leaning state might doom his prospects with the more conservative national Republican primary electorate in 2008. Christie, in contrast, has spent a great deal of time and energy winning over New Jersey voters who had once dismissed him as a loudmouth ideologue. Has Christie made a serious miscalculation that could doom his prospects for national office? Or is he savvier than his critics understand? A year ago, conservative activists were enthralled with Christie, who had gained a national following for his quick wit and his combativeness in taking on his state's powerful public employee unions. Even after the Republican primaries were underway, a number of GOP stalwarts hoped that Christie would jump into the presidential race, despite that he was still in his first term as governor. Part of Christie's appeal was that as the hard-charging Republican chief executive of an overwhelmingly Democratic Northeastern state, he had the potential to scramble the electoral map. While the GOP fares well in rural areas and in the suburbs of the South and the Mountain West, the party has taken a beating in the big cities and suburbs of the coasts ever since the rise of Bill Clinton. Christie's common-sense conservatism, however, had managed to win over skeptical voters in one of the country's densest and most diverse states. But in recent months, Christie has lost some of his luster on the right. His keynote address at the Republican National Convention was widely viewed as a disappointment, with many suggesting that it had focused too much on Christie's biography and accomplishments rather than the virtues of the Romney-Ryan ticket. And in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, which devastated large stretches of New Jersey's coastline, the governor was fulsome in his praise of Obama's response, giving the embattled incumbent a crucial boost in the days before the election. Most recently, Christie excoriated House Speaker John Boehner and congressional Republicans for having failed to vote on a Sandy relief bill that promised tens of billions of dollars in aid to his beleaguered constituents. Christie's crossing of party lines has struck at least some of his erstwhile conservative admirers as disloyal in the extreme. Avlon: Chris Christie drops bomb on GOP leaders . At the same time, Christie's decisions to distance himself from the House GOP and to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Obama have greatly strengthened his reputation in New Jersey, where his approval rating hit 77% late last year according to a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind survey. After having been one of the state's most polarizing political figures, Christie has been embraced by a growing number of Democrats, many of whom have come to see him as a bipartisan problem-solver. Indeed, Christie's political standing reportedly helped convince Cory Booker, the popular mayor of Newark, New Jersey's most populous city, to abandon his plans of running for governor in 2013. Louis: GOP civil war over Sandy disaster relief . Assuming Christie wins re-election this year, which is far from a foregone conclusion, he has one powerful asset going forward in national politics: The Republican brand has suffered a great deal in recent years. In a survey conducted by the firm Edelman Berland, voters were asked to compare Democrats and Republicans across a number of brand attributes. An overwhelming majority of respondents chose the Democrats as the party that ""cares about people like me,"" ""offers a hopeful vision"" and ""focuses on issues that matter to me."" If a Republican presidential candidate is going to win in 2016, she or he will have to overcome this deficit. Leading Republicans such as Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana have made an effort to talk about issues of interest to middle-income voters, an area in which Republicans have been sorely lacking. Yet Christie's willingness to distance himself from congressional Republicans gives him added credibility in selling himself as ""a different kind of Republican,"" and it is reminiscent of the strategy pursued by then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who was sharply critical of congressional Republicans for their willingness to cut anti-poverty programs. It is not obvious that a ""kinder, gentler"" Republicanism will fare well in the primary process come 2016, but it is a shrewd way to differentiate oneself from a primary field in which most challengers will be competing to demonstrate their conservative bona fides. And more to the point, a Republican nominee who manages to convey a softer, most centrist image will have a much easier time winning the next general election. That could be Christie's long game. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reihan Salam.","Chris Christie has been taking steps that could offend conservatives in GOP .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected U.S. drone attack killed five people early Wednesday in Pakistan's tribal region that borders Afghanistan, two Pakistani intelligence officials said. It was the first drone strike since demonstrators marched to the border of Pakistan's tribal region over the weekend to protest the attacks. Activists from the United States and Britain participated in the march, which was led by the cricket star turned politician Imran Khan. Opinion: Why U.S. will live to regret drone strikes .

Four missiles were fired Wednesday at a suspected militant hideout in the area of Mir Ali of North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of the volatile tribal region, the two intelligence officials said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the matter to the news media. The protest march against U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan came to a halt on Sunday when authorities used steel shipping containers and security forces to block access to the demonstration's final destination in the tribal region. When confronted with the roadblock, Khan directed protesters to turn back, saying the march had achieved its goal of drawing attention to the controversial U.S. drone strikes.

"(CNN) -- Wednesday marks Losar, or the Tibetan New Year, but there will be no music, chanting, spectacular costumes or pageantry this year. Instead, Tibetans across the world plan to observe Losar with the solemnity their government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India, has proclaimed it deserves. Lobsang Sangay, the Tibetan prime minister-in-exile, issued a statement asking Tibetans to refrain from celebration. ""But do observe traditional and spiritual rituals by going to the monastery, making offerings and lighting butter lamps for all those who have sacrificed and suffered under the repressive policies of Chinese government,"" Sangay said. Sangay asked for a somber New Year because of the ""grim news"" that continues to stream out of Tibet, he said. China pushing Nepal to crack down on Tibetans? In the past year, 22 monks, nuns and other Tibetans set themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule, according to the Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet. The latest incident occurred Saturday when an 18-year-old monk self-immolated in front of a monastery in the village of Barma village in China's Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, according to a statement from the government-in-exile. He apparently died shouting, ""May His Holiness the Dalai Lama live 10,000 years!"" and ""Freedom for Tibet,"" the International Campaign for Tibet said. The government-in-exile also said it has had news of arrests of Tibetan writers and intellectuals. China accuses Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for inciting unrest and trying to divide China. But monks who spoke secretly to CNN said they want China to allow the Dalai Lama to return to a free Tibet. In their pouch, they carry a sacred keepsake of their leader. In 1950, Chinese troops occupied Tibet, enforcing what Beijing says is a centuries-old claim over the region. Nine years later, the Dalai Lama fled to India after a failed uprising in Lhasa left 85,000 people dead. Pro-Tibetan groups say Chinese persecution and torture has killed hundreds of thousands of Tibetans over the years. They also say Han Chinese, China's main ethnic group, have migrated to the region and turned Tibetans into a minority in their homeland. Sangay urged Tibetans to protest non-violently and legally, especially on March 10, the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising. ""We once again fervently urge the Chinese government to give serious consideration to our legitimate demands and appeals we have made so far,"" the government statement said. Sangay said he wanted to make sure Tibetan voices were heard loud and clear in Beijing. Tibetans all over the world began posting Sangay's message on websites. In the United States, several Tibetan associations canceled Losar celebrations, one of the biggest annual festivities for Tibetans. ""It means much more than Losar,"" said Tsepak Rigzin, program director at the Drepung Loseling center in Atlanta. This year, he said, Losar would truly signify unity, solidarity, compassion. ""It's a symbol of our integrity,"" said Rigzin, 51, who has lived in the United States since 2005. ""It means sharing the suffering and pain of our brothers and sisters of Tibet."" He, like Tibetans everywhere, will begin the year 2139 with quiet contemplation -- and dreams of a homeland.

Austin Reed Sigg, a student at Arapahoe Community College, was also charged with attempting to kidnap, sexually assault and murder a female jogger last May. The charges were outlined in a 17-count accusation filed by Jefferson County, Colorado, District Attorney Pam Russell Tuesday. Sigg, who lived about one mile from Ridgeway's home in Westminster, was charged as an adult, a decision that could be challenged by his lawyers.

"(CNN) -- Ghanaian authorities detained an American couple on suspicion of trying to adopt four children illegally in the African nation, U.S. officials said. Sol and Christine Moghadam from Irvine, California, traveled to Ghana with their two biological children to adopt four siblings there. They adopted the children on June 14, but officials in the nation questioned the legality of their adoption, leading to their detention over the weekend, according to Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the State Department. ""Ghana was concerned that some of the documents they had weren't filled out properly or were forged,"" said Hank Fortener, founder of AdoptTogether, an advocacy group that provides a platform for prospective parents to raise funds. The couple used the group's website to raise funds. African adoption should be discouraged 'at all costs,' group says . Though they are still in the nation, Ghanaian officials have since determined their documents are legitimate, according to Fortener. A bond has been posted for their release and they were reunited with their biological children Monday, Nuland said this week. ""We are emotionally exhausted and traumatized from the entire incident but we are thankful to have support and prayers from friends and family worldwide,"" the Moghadams said on their blog, Our adoption journey to Africa. ""Our case is not complete yet, but our chief officer from the Ghana police department has apologized for their overreaction and stated that our detainment was a mistake on their part. "" CNN's repeated attempts to reach the couple and Ghanaian officials were unsuccessful. The Moghadams initially planned to adopt a child in Ethiopia in 2010, but decided on Ghana after they saw the four siblings on the waiting list of an adoption agency. Africa has seen a surge of adoptions in the past eight years, according to adoption expert Peter Selman from Newcastle University in Britain. A new report from The African Child Policy Forum entitled ""Africa: The New Frontier for Intercountry Adoption"" says prospective adoptive parents are turning ""en masse"" to the continent as other countries toughen their laws. Most children adopted from Africa go to the United States or France, two of the world's biggest receiving countries, Selman said.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal made a successful return to the tennis court on Tuesday, ending a seven-month injury absence with victory in a doubles match in Chile. The former world No. 1 teamed up with Argentina's Juan Monaco for his first competitive outing since losing in the second round at Wimbledon in late June 2012. They enjoyed a 6-3 6-2 victory over the second-seeded Czech pairing of Frantisek Cermak and Lukas Dlouhy in the first round of the Vina del Mar Open. It set up Nadal for his opening singles match on Wednesday, having been given a first-round bye as top seed. ""First win with Pico, we felt a great ambiance on court! Thanks to the crowd and you all for the support!"" Nadal tweeted. The 11-time grand slam champion, who is now ranked fifth in the world as he continues his recovery from knee surgery, will play 128th-ranked Federico Del Bonis. Del Bonis came from behind to beat fellow Argentine Guido Pella 2-6 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-1) on Tuesday. Nadal said before the claycourt tournament that he would have to be patient in his long-awaited comeback, having missed the season's opening grand slam in Australia due to an illness which delayed his preparations.

"(CNN) -- Neymar plays football like he tackles life -- with flair, excitement and a sense of fun. At 20, he is potentially the best young player on the planet, and is tipped to follow in the illustrious footsteps of Brazilian icons such as Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and perhaps even the legendary Pele. The Santos forward's flamboyant tricks and flicks have captured the attention of scouts around the world, with his exceptional solo strike against Flamengo earning him FIFA's 2011 Ferenc Puskas award for the year's best goal. And his flair on the pitch is more than matched off it. Neymar was pictured several times lapping up the party atmosphere during the recent carnival season in his homeland. Can Qatari cash make PSG a football force? ""I'm 20 years old, I have to take advantage of being young,"" he told CNN. ""It's hard, especially for me. I want to do this and that, but I have to follow a line. I'm a professional player and a professional athlete. I have to resist some things to get ahead in the future. That's my life."" Despite his appetite for the sights and sounds of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Neymar is still working hard to improve all aspects of his game. ""I'm always trying to perfect everything -- dribbling, shooting, headers and control. You can always improve,"" said the striker, who last year helped Santos win South America's top club tournament, the Copa Libertadores. Neymar is also becoming an increasingly important part of the Mano Manezes' Brazil national team, scoring eight goals in his first 16 games for his country. ""Being on the Brazilian team is a privilege,"" he said. ""There are some marvelous players and I'm very happy to be among them."" In 2014, the World Cup will arrive in Brazil, and the country's football fans expect their ""Samba Kings"" to claim a record sixth crown on home soil. But Neymar is not letting himself get distracted by dreams of glory. ""It's two years away, it's a long time. But in football, time passes quickly. So I have to constantly be playing a good game, constantly working so that I'm in every line up,"" he said. Whether Neymar will still be plying his trade in Brazil when the four-yearly tournament comes around is unclear. He has been heavily linked with a move to Spanish and European champions Barcelona, Real Madrid and English side Chelsea. ""I don't know about the future,"" he said. ""It is two years, a lot can happen. I don't know if I'll leave or if I'll stay, there are a lot of things ahead ... Barcelona is an excellent team. If not the best team of all time, then they are among the best."" Joining the Catalan club would give Neymar the chance to team up with a player who he has been drawing favorable comparisons with, Argentina's three-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi. ""The best player currently is Messi. I think he is a great player at an excellent time on a great team. So for me, he is the best,"" he said. Earning a move to one of Europe's leading teams would depend on Neymar keeping on the straight and narrow. If he does stray too far from his sporting duties, his father is there to get him back on track. ""My father has been by my side since I was little,"" he said. ""He takes care of things, my finances and my family. ""He is the one who is in charge. He's the boss. There's always somebody nearby, keeping an eye on me more than watching me.""","Brazil star Neymar says he has to enjoy being young while he has the chance .

"(CNN) -- Spotting the ""next big thing"" in sport is an expensive business. Millions of dollars and countless hours are spent on talent identification, but it's an unpredictable science. Except perhaps in horse racing, where major strides are being made in picking out potential winners in an industry where huge rewards are at stake. Thoroughbred stallion Fusaichi Pegasus, for example, became the most expensive horse in history in 2000 after being sold to Ireland's Coolmore Stud for $60 million, having been bought as a yearling for $4 million. So just imagine what it would mean to breeders if they could determine how successful a horse would be before buying or selling them as a foal? A company involved in thoroughbred research, Equinome, has been analyzing a particular strand of DNA within a horse -- dubbed the ""speed gene"" -- which can determine just how well equipped it will be for racing. Such chromosome information can also be a powerful tool for breeders as it helps them determine just what type of horse will be produced by different types of coupling. The mating game: Will Frankel and Black Caviar breed superhorses? ""At first we had a positive response, and now over the last 18 months things have really taken off,"" Equinome's managing director Donal Ryan told CNN. ""Every region is interested -- New Zealand, Singapore, the United States -- and breeders have already used our test thousands of times."" Equinome maintains a strict policy of confidentiality with its clients, but Ryan did reveal that the first horses bred following speed-gene testing are already racing professionally. Breeders are also offered the $1,500 ""elite performance test,"" which analyzes 54,000 genetic factors. While its results may not provide the meticulous levels of accuracy the ""speed gene"" test delivers, it categorizes how likely a horse is -- genetically speaking -- to win. ""Horses are placed within one of four class bands; a class one would be 11 times better than a class four,"" said Ryan. ""The criteria obviously differ from subject to subject. With a sprint horse we would be looking at traits such as lactate metabolism and vascularization, whereas a horse with stamina we might analyze heart physiology and respiration."" Robin Oakley, turf columnist for ""The Spectator"" magazine and author of three books on the world of racing, dubbed the research as ""almost the holy grail for breeders and trainers."" ""For years they have searched for a way to remove the gamble inherent within breeding -- imagine, not having to fly mares all over the world, mating with all those different studs just trying to get the right results,"" he said. Another milestone for fantastic Frankel at Glorious Goodwood . In Australia, Widden Stud farm in New South Wales has produced six former Australian champion sires since its foundation in 1867. It is the first breeder to include Equinome's ""speed gene"" results in its stud brochures. ""The test is certainly very interesting to us,"" says Widden Stud's general manager Derek Field. ""Breeders have been searching for years for ways to do their job more efficiently, and there are a lot of pieces to the puzzle but this is certainly a key to unlocking it. ""People have looked in-depth at hearts and other organs but have come and gone. These speed gene tests can help develop studies in the right direction. It's worth keeping a close eye on."" However, Ryan stresses that genetic research is only one piece of the puzzle of breeding winners. ""Genetics is only 35-55% of the battle. The rest is down to the way the horse is raised, from insemination through to foaling to its upbringing and race training; the aspects that will always be most important are not genetic,"" he said. ""We aim to guide the trainers and breeders, so they can correctly focus their efforts."" Ryan insists Equinome's work will not detract from the competitive spirit of the sport. ""It is simply a tool to be utilized. It is ineffectual if not applied properly,"" he said. ""I cannot see it taking away from the 'fun' of the sport, as some have put it."" Field agrees: ""The idea of mating horses more efficiently has been around since the sport began. This discovery does nothing to detract from the competition."" Twitter: From the horse's mouth . Australia's OTI Racing and Bloodstock Management has also utilized Equinome's tests. But rather than breed its own horses it instead buys them as ""tried"" yearlings, often imported from all over the world. These horses are then raced internationally, predominantly in Great Britain and France as well as Australia. As OTI's reputation, not to mention profits, rely on the performance of its yearlings, it needs to buy the right horses and send them to the correct trainer. ""We were approached by a representative from their marketing team,"" OTI co-owner and director Terry Henderson said of its relationship with Equinome. ""I was fascinated by the science -- the sound logic and good research which they applied appealed to me. We made sure to do our own research to put their methods to the test. ""We took 12 blood samples from 12 different horses and sent them for a blind testing at Equinome -- this way they would have no idea if the blood was from a broken-down old mare or a champion sprinter. The correlations produced by their results gave us great confidence."" Fame and fillies: Meet the celebrity racehorse owners . Henderson says the professional racing community has reacted cautiously to Equinome's research. ""I was skeptical too at first. So much rubbish science is presented to the horse racing industry. So many ideas and tools claim to be unique but fail to deliver that professionals are gun-shy -- rarely is anything supported by the depth of research that Equinome offer,"" he said. OTI has not fully embraced the testing yet, but the company is at an ""advanced testing"" stage working towards a more complete relationship. ""It's very encouraging, but it'll still be two to three years before our confidence is at 90%-plus,"" Henderson said. ""Right now we're testing half of our purchases. Sometimes, what with the rate at which we complete transactions or because of contractual obligations, we do not have time to take the test. We do aim to test all of our domestic purchases, though."" The British Horse Racing Authority says such testing is ""a commercial issue and it would not be appropriate for a regulatory body to comment."" Henderson believes it poses no threat to the industry's competitive balance. ""This is no different to the developments made in breeding 100 years ago. Innovations will always divide opinion -- it will be gospel to some and rubbish to others,"" he said. ""It's the most significant development we've seen in a while but it won't unbalance the playing field, that's for sure.""","Scientists discover ""speed gene"" within horse DNA which governs physical ability .

"(CNN) -- It's not often that a golfer shoots an 11-under-par 60 but finishes his round with a tinge of disappointment. But that fate befell Phil Mickelson, who saw his perfectly struck 25-foot birdie putt curl around the cup but not drop on the par-four ninth at the TPC at Scottsdale in Arizona. It was his final hole of the first round of the Phoenix Open and had it gone down, the American superstar would have joined the elite club of five players who have broken 60 on the PGA Tour. ""To see that last putt lip out the way it did and not go in, it's crushing because you don't get that chance very often to shoot 59,"" he told the official PGA Tour website. ""He could not have hit a better putt,"" said his long-time caddie Jim Mackay. ""Disappointing for everyone to not see that one go in on the last,"" said one of Mickelson's playing partner's Rickie Fowler. Mickelson, who achieved the same 11-under 60 score at the tournament in 2005, joins fellow Masters winner Zach Johnson in being the only two PGA Tour players to shot 60 or better more than once in their careers. ""I was ecstatic (in 2005), and I'm ecstatic to shoot 60 (today),"" Mickelson said. ""But there's a big difference between 60 and 59. Not that big between 60 and 61, there really isn't. But there's a big barrier, a Berlin Wall barrier, between 59 and 60."" In another twist, fellow American Bo Van Pelt had shot a 59 in the pro-am Wednesday, but it does not count for the record books, while Mickelson himself carded a 59 at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in 2004, a four-man invitational tournament which does not count towards the official money list. The five golfers to have carded official 59s on the PGA Tour date back to Al Geiberger in 1977. Paul Goydos, Chip Beck, David Duval and Australian Stuart Appleby, the latest in the 2010 Greenbrier Classic, have also achieved the feat. The world record is a 12-under 58 by young Japanese golfer Ryo Ishikawa at a tournament in his home country in 2010. Mickelson's heroics left him four shots clear of the field heading into Friday's second round -- a big improvement on his two previous lackluster displays in earlier events in the 2013 season. The four-time major winner has also attracted controversy off the course over remarks he made about tax rates in his home state of California, but on it he remains an flamboyant performer who regularly thrills the galleries. Meanwhile, Richard Sterne of South Africa has a slender one-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour. He followed his opening 62 -- one shy of compatriot Ernie Els' superb course record -- with a two-under 70 in tougher conditions on the second day on the Majilis Course at the Emirates Golf Club. Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, England's Tommy Fleetwood and Stephen Gallacher of Scotland were tied for second on 133. Spanish star Sergio Garcia was on 135, while world number eight Lee Westwood of England trailed by six shots after a one-under 71 in his first tournament of the year.","Phil Mickelson shoots an 11-under 60 to lead Phoenix Open .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Novak Djokovic shrugged off an injury scare to beat fifth seed David Ferrer in the Australian Open quarterfinals on Wednesday, setting up a last-four rematch with 2011 runner-up Andy Murray. The world No. 1 pulled up and clutched his leg while leading 2-1 in the second set, but recovered to secure a 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 win over the Spaniard despite moving uncomfortably between points. ""Luckily for me it wasn't something that stayed there for long time,"" the four-time grand slam winner told reporters after reaching his seventh straight grand slam semifinal. ""It was just a sudden pain ... David makes you run, makes you play an extra shot, makes you earn your points."" Kvitova faces Sharapova in semifinal rematch . However, the Serbian revealed that he has been struggling with his breathing in the Melbourne heat. ""I found it very difficult after a long time to breathe because I felt the whole day my nose was closed a little bit. I just wasn't able to get enough oxygen,"" he said. ""At this stage of the tournament, when you're playing somebody like David who has great shots from both sides from the baseline, makes you always play over five to 10 shots in the rally, your physical strength and endurance comes into question. ""I think actually I'm not concerned. I'm really fit and I have no concerns of recovering for the next match. It's just a matter of breathing better through the nose."" Fourth seed Murray is searching for a first major title, having been beaten in the last two Melbourne finals by Roger Federer in 2010 and then Djokovic last year. The Scot, also beaten by Federer in the 2008 U.S. Open title match, ended the hopes of Japanese 24th seed Kei Nishikori with a 6-3 6-3 6-1 success in their quarterfinal. ""He's definitely very motivated to win his first grand slam,"" said Djokovic of Murray after reaching his fifth successive grand slam semifinal. ""He's been proving to himself and to the rest of the people that the Australian Open is probably his best grand slam. ""But on the other hand I have been playing quite well here in last couple years ... it's definitely going to take a lot of effort to be a winner from that match."" World No. 26 Nishikori was Japan's first Australian Open quarterfinalist since 1932 and the first male player from the country to reach the last eight of a major since Shuzo Matsuoka at Wimbledon in 1995. Next week he will move into the top-20 for the first time in his career. Djokovic holds the edge in the head-to-head record against Murray, having won six and lost four of their 10 matches -- including victory in their only clash at a grand slam. That 2011 final defeat sent Murray into a minor form slump, but he bounced back to reach the last four at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows. ""I've always liked playing against him. After the year that he had, the loss didn't look so bad six months later,"" Murray said of Djokovic, who won three of 2011's four grand slam titles. ""I'll need to serve better. I had a sore neck today when I woke up and I wasn't feeling all my serve. But I was returning good, hitting the ball clean from the back of the court, moved forward well. So it was good."" Thursday's first semifinal will see second seed and 10-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal take on Switzerland's No. 4 Federer -- a winner of a record 16 major titles. Djokovic, Murray, Nadal and Federer have dominated men's tennis in recent years, filling the final four spots at three of the last five grand slams. At least three of the four top-ranked players have advanced to the semifinals in each of the last seven majors.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic survives injury scare at the Australian Open .

"Washington (CNN) -- Drivers of commercial trucks and buses are prohibited from texting under federal guidelines that U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced Tuesday. ""We want the drivers of big rigs and buses and those who share the roads with them to be safe,"" LaHood said in a statement. ""This is an important safety step, and we will be taking more to eliminate the threat of distracted driving."" The prohibition is effective immediately. Truck and bus drivers who text while driving commercial vehicles may be subject to civil or criminal penalties of up to $2,750, the Department of Transportation said in a news release. The release did not offer specifics on how the prohibition will be enforced. One of the nation's largest groups representing professional truck drivers -- the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association -- expressed support for the goal but dismay at its implementation. ""We support where they are going, but not how they got there,"" said Todd Spencer, the group's executive vice president. ""Making their action effective immediately bypasses normal regulatory rulemaking processes. Those processes allow actions to be vetted for unintended consequences as well as potential implementation and enforcement problems. ""We very much share in their goal, but their legal justification for taking immediate action raises many concerns."" Cracking down on distracted drivers has been a focus of LaHood's since he took office last year. In September, he convened a two-day summit on the issue in Washington. The Transportation Department recently launched the Web site distraction.gov to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted driving. And this month, LaHood and National Safety Council President Janet Froetscher announced the creation of the advocacy group FocusDriven, a nonprofit that supports the families of distracted driving victims, modeled after Mothers Against Drunk Driving. According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, drivers take their eyes off the road for an average of 4.6 seconds out of every six seconds while texting. This research shows drivers who text are more than 20 times more likely to get in an accident than nondistracted drivers. Nineteen states, plus the District of Columbia and Guam, have passed laws banning texting while driving. Six states, plus the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, ban the use of handheld devices while driving. President Obama also signed an executive order requiring federal employees not to text while driving government-owned vehicles or with government-owned equipment, and were ordered to comply with the move December 30. Nearly 6,000 people died in 2008 in crashes involving a distracted or inattentive driver, and more than 500,000 were injured, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Eighty percent of crashes are related to driver inattention, according to a Virginia Tech study, and drivers who use handheld devices are four times as likely to get into crashes serious enough to injure themselves, the National Safety Council reports. The focus on texting while driving comes after a few high-profile accidents. In September 2008, a California commuter train engineer missed a stop signal while trading text messages with a friend, leading to a collision with a freight train that killed 25 people, according to federal investigators. A mass-transit accident in Boston, Massachusetts, injured 62 people in May. The operator of a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority trolley later was charged with gross negligence after admitting he had been texting seconds before the collision with another trolley, according to the Suffolk County district attorney and a National Transportation Safety Board official.","NEW: Truckers' group expresses concern about rule taking effect immediately .

"(CNN) -- A coiffed pooch mistaken for a lion's cub is causing quite an uproar in Virginia. Charles the dog was frolicking down the streets in Norfolk, minding his own business, when panicked passers-by started calling 911. With a dyed tail and a fluffy coat groomed to resemble a lion's mane, the pup's appearance was a little unusual. ""I'd like to report a lion sighting,"" a man said in the 911 call. ""Say that again?"" a dispatcher responded. A few minutes later, another call came in. ""I just saw an animal that looked like a small lion,"" a man said. ""Had the mane and everything ... I don't know if it got away from the zoo, or what."" And the flurry continued, including a resident who told the dispatcher that the ""baby lion"" is the size of a Labrador retriever. As soon as the calls trickled in, the Norfolk Police Department contacted the local zoo to ensure its two lions were caged and accounted for. ""We all looked at each other like, 'Could it be?'"" Greg Bockheim, the Virginia Zoo executive director, told CNN affiliate WAVY. Zoo workers scuttled to the lions' cages, he said, but the big cats were fast asleep. Police moved on to more pressing matters when they realized this wasn't a runaway baby Simba from ""The Lion King."" Nor was it on the lam from the zoo. It was a Labrador-poodle mix -- full name Charles the Monarch -- strolling down the streets after a recent visit to the groomers. His owner, Daniel Painter, told the affiliate that the dog's shave represents the lion mascot at the Old Dominion University'. Charles has turned into a celebrity since his sighting Tuesday, and is making rounds on national morning shows. He also has a Facebook page that chronicles his life as a ""party animal."" And the cuddly 3-year-old is not shy about his new role as the ""mane"" attraction.

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. military supply ship fired at a small boat in the Persian Gulf on Monday after it came too close, killing one person onboard and wounding three, Defense Department officials said. The USNS Rappahannock, a fuel resupply ship, fired on what two U.S. officials called a ""small, white pleasure craft"" 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Dubai port of Jebel Ali. The casualties were Indian fishermen, according to the United Arab Emirates' news agency WAM. U.S. officials expressed their condolences and said the incident is under investigation. The small boat appeared to be headed for that port, the Defense Department officials said, adding that their information was preliminary. The U.S. ship verbally warned the smaller boat when it was 1,200 yards (1,100 meters) away and fired at least one warning shot before the decision was made to fire shots to disable the boat, the officials said. ""In accordance with Navy force protection procedures, the sailors on the USNS Rappahannock ... used a series of nonlethal, preplanned responses to warn the vessel before resorting to lethal force,"" the Navy said in a statement. ""The U.S. crew repeatedly attempted to warn the vessel's operators to turn away from their deliberate approach. When those efforts failed to deter the approaching vessel, the security team on the Rappahannock fired rounds from a .50-caliber machine gun."" Officials described the course of events as standard procedures when a small boat gets too close to a U.S. Navy ship. The officials, who would not be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation, also described the small boat as having made a series of maneuvers, but emphasized they were waiting for more details about what exactly happened. UAE authorities are investigating the incident, WAM quoted Tariq Ahmed Al Haidan, a Foreign Ministry official, as saying. And a UAE source said the Emirates' government would follow up after a review. Jebel Ali is 22 miles (35 kilometers) southwest of Dubai and 37 miles (60 kilometers) north of Abu Dhabi. With 67 berths and extensive dry-dock facilities, it is the largest man-made port in the world and the largest port in the Gulf region and in the Middle East.","NEW: The UAE says the dead and wounded were Indian fishermen .

"(CNN) -- The rising country duo Florida Georgia Line -- Tyler Hubbard, 25, of Monroe, Georgia, and Brian Kelley, 27, of Ormond Beach, Florida -- are already topping the country charts, and they haven't even released their debut album yet. ""Here's To The Good Times,"" which includes the hit tune, ""Cruise,"" will hit stores December 4. Not only do they have the support of fans, they've been generating Twitter buzz from big time country acts: . ""Can't stop playing cruise by @FLAGALine! Crazy cool toon!!!!!"" Keith Urban tweeted in September. Meanwhile, Taylor Swift posted, ""Doing interviews w/ a song stuck in my head=""Focus. Answer the question. BABY YOU A SONG, YOU MAKE ME WANNA ROLL MY WINDOWS DOWN AND CRUISE."" Around the same time, Jennifer Nettles wrote, ""Confession: Fave new guilty pleasure on country radio: @FLAGALine ""Cruise"". I dance. Big, ole belly and all. If u like country, check it out."" The attention from country music's heavy hitters has been quite the shout-out for Kelley. ""I think that's probably the biggest compliment, when you look up and you see your peers you look to, love and respect ... Keith Urban, Jennifer Nettles, Taylor Swift. That's one of those moments where you hit yourself and say -- are we dreaming?"" said Kelley. Despite making their name in country music, the duo cite hip-hop and rap as their biggest influences. ""Everybody in the high school parking lot was either blaring some country music or blaring rap -- and I guess over the years it just kind of comes together somewhere in the middle,"" Hubbard said. ""There's not really a genre for what we do,"" he continued. ""We're believers that music evolves, and we like to be on the cutting edge of music."" Hubbard and Kelley admit they dream of collaborating with Lil Wayne or Wiz Khalifa -- but they also have strong roots in country songwriting, having co-written many tracks from their debut album with veteran country songwriter Rodney Clawson. Clawson has written hit songs for George Strait, Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton and more. The duo weren't intimidated. ""We just walked in ... get to know each other and sip on some coffee, start trying to write a song -- you know, see what happens. It was really smooth and quick. Everything just kind of came out,"" Hubbard said. ""The hardest part is getting Rodney off the lake to write a song,"" joked Kelley. ""He loves some fishing."" The success of Florida Georgia Line's debut single ""Cruise"" landed them on tour with headliners Jake Owen and Love and Theft. ""So far, it's probably been the best tour we've been on. It's been just great. We're great friends with Eric, Steve in Love and Theft, and Jake. ... Memories are being made,"" Kelley said. The duo are wrapping up their current tour in December, but will be joining fellow country artist Luke Bryan on tour in 2013. Hubbard and Kelley started their current tour in a Chevy Tahoe. One of the things they're looking forward to is upgrading vehicles. ""I'm most excited about getting out there and experiencing a long tour in a tour bus and getting to hang out with Luke,"" Kelley said. ""Every tour we go on, you always make really good friends with everybody out there. And by the end of the tour you feel like a family.""","Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley are the rising country duo Florida Georgia Line .

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts is appealing a federal judge's ruling that the state must pay for the sex-change surgery of a transsexual prison inmate. ""Following a thorough review of the decision, we believe the court failed to give due deference to the fact that the Department (of Correction) has and continues to provide adequate medical treatment to address inmate Kosilek's gender identity disorder,"" said Diane Wiffin, public affairs director for the Massachusetts Department of Correction, in a statement Wednesday. In an unprecedented court order earlier this month, U. S. District Court Chief Judge Mark L. Wolf determined that sex-reassignment surgery was the ""only adequate treatment"" for Michelle Kosilek, who was previously known as Robert. Kosilek has been incarcerated in an all-male prison, serving a life sentence without parole for murdering his wife in 1990. Wolf ruled ""that there is no less intrusive means to correct the prolonged violation of Kosilek's Eighth Amendment right to adequate medical care."" Kosilek's attorney's office declined to comment Thursday, citing the pending appeal. The ruling September 6 sparked some heated reaction. U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, said the court's decision was ""an outrageous abuse of taxpayer dollars."" State Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr commended the Department of Correction in a statement Wednesday ""for standing up and opposing this outrageous request and for taking the necessary action to prevent it from being legitimized by a legal decision."" There was no immediate reaction from the office of Gov. Deval Patrick. Many from the transgender community say the ruling should stand. ""Prisoners have a right to necessary medical care, and this is indisputably medical care, as the very strong district court decision established. There really is no legal ground for this appeal,"" Jennifer Levi, the director of the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders' transgender rights project, said in a statement released Wednesday with the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition. ""Care that is medically necessary for prisoners cannot be denied based on public opinion,"" said Gunner Scott, executive director of the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition. It wasn't until 1999, when Kosilek first filed suit after repeatedly asking the prison for treatment for her disorder, that the court recognized her medical needs, according to Frances Cohen, one of Kosilek's lawyers. In 2002, the court found that the Department of Correction had refused to provide Kosilek with the proper medical treatment she needed, as had been prescribed by the department's doctors. That year, Kosilek began to receive psychotherapy and hormone treatments. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, with all operations, therapy, hormone injections and electrolysis, the cost of sex reassignment surgery can range from $30,000 to $80,000. Court documents show Kosilek attempted to castrate herself and tried to commit suicide twice while incarcerated in an all-male prison in Norfolk. The court ruling left it up to the Department of Correction to decide where Kosilek will be incarcerated after the surgery.

"(CNN) -- Racing legend Frankie Dettori will work as a freelance jockey in 2013, ending an 18-year spell with the Dubai-owned Godolphin stable. The Italian will not be directly employed by Godolphin, owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, but will continue to race for the stable. ""We have had a tremendous association with Frankie over many years,"" Godolphin's racing manager Simon Crisford said in a statement. ""He has achieved so much on behalf of Godolphin and has made the difference between winning and losing on so many occasions in the world's biggest races. ""However, Frankie is looking for a fresh challenge and we felt that the retainer was not really working so this is the best way forward. We have had many great days together and we look forward to working with Frankie in the future and hopefully enjoying more success together. ""He remains a great friend -- the difference next year will be that he will not be our retained jockey and will operate as a freelance instead."" Dettori has ridden 110 Group or Grade One winners for Godolphin since claiming the stable's first Classic on Balanchine in 1994. ""I have had 18 wonderful years,"" said the 41-year-old Dettori as he looked back on his time in the royal blue silks. ""Godolphin has been a major part of everything I have achieved in racing and I have loved every minute of it. ""I feel the time has come for a change. My position in the stable has changed a little bit and I need a new challenge. ""Sheikh Mohammed has been an unbelievable boss to me. He had the confidence to take me on board when I was young and we smashed every record together. I will be forever grateful to him for everything he has done for me and for my family."" Arguably Dettori is most famous for riding seven different winners in one day at British racecourse Ascot in September 1996. Godolphin will retain French jockey Mickael Barzalona and Brazil's Silvestre de Sousa for next year.","Jockey Frankie Dettori leaves Goldolphin stable after 18 years .

"(CNN) -- A Lance Armstrong representative tried to make a donation of about $250,000 to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency before the agency launched the investigation that led to the cyclist being stripped of his Tour de France titles, the chief of the USADA said. ""I was stunned,"" Travis Tygart, the head of the anti-doping agency told ""60 Minutes Sports'' about the alleged 2004 offer. ''It was a clear conflict of interest for USADA. We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.'' Armstrong attorney Tim Herman said there's no truth to the story. ""He never made any such contribution or suggestion,"" Herman said in a statement e-mailed to CNN Wednesday. Annie Skinner, a spokeswoman for the USADA, told CNN that Tygart's quotes, released by ""60 Minutes Sports,'' were accurate. The new accusation is another chapter in the twisting tale of Armstrong, a one-time hero to many who has now fallen in disgrace. Armstrong will give his first television interview since being stripped of his Tour de France titles to Oprah Winfrey, her network announced Tuesday. A news release from the Oprah Winfrey Network said the 90-minute ""no-holds-barred"" interview will air at 9 p.m. ET January 17 and will be simulcast on Oprah.com. Winfrey will ask the cyclist to address the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's report, which said there was overwhelming evidence Armstrong was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program, the statement said. The International Cycling Union, which chose not to appeal the USADA's lifetime ban, stripped Armstrong of his record seven Tour victories in October. Armstrong's lawyer: No talks with anti-doping agencies . The World Anti-Doping Agency also agreed with the sanctions, which means Armstrong may not compete in sports governed by WADA code. Before the ban, he was competing in Ironman triathlons and had won two of the five events he had entered. Since the ban he has entered two non-sanctioned events. According to his Twitter feed, Armstrong has been biking, running and swimming in Hawaii. The Winfrey interview will take place at Armstrong's home in Austin, Texas. The New York Times reported last week that Armstrong, 41, was contemplating publicly admitting he used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Such an admission might lead toward Armstrong regaining his eligibility. One of his attorneys denied Armstrong was in discussion with the two anti-doping agencies. Dan Wuori, a writer at cycling publication Velo Magazine, said Armstrong may reveal a lot during the Oprah interview. ""I think what we are seeing here is the beginning of Lance's effort at redemption,"" Wuori said. ""More and more continues to come out about Armstrong. This seems like an effort of Armstrong to get ahead of the story and control the narrative."" The gain game: Why do sports stars cheat? Armstrong has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs as well as illegal blood transfusions during his cycling career. Armstrong has been an icon for his cycling feats and celebrity, bringing more status to a sport wildly popular in some nations but lacking big-name recognition, big money and mass appeal in the United States. He fought back from testicular cancer to win the Tour from 1999 to 2005. He raised millions via his Lance Armstrong Foundation to help cancer victims and survivors, an effort illustrated by trendy yellow ""LiveSTRONG"" wristbands that helped bring in the money. But Armstrong has long been dogged by doping allegations, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test -- making a series of claims in 2011. Armstrong sued the USADA last year to stop its investigation of him, arguing it did not have the right to prosecute him. But after a federal judge dismissed the case, Armstrong said he would no longer participate in the investigation. In October 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his titles and banned from cycling. Weeks later, he stepped down from the board of his foundation, Livestrong. It is unclear whether Armstrong would face criminal prosecution for perjury should he confess. Armstrong was involved in several cases where he gave sworn testimony that he never used banned drugs.

"(CNN) -- It is that time of the year, again. Come January, as soon as the Christmas trees are taken down and the winter sales flood the shops, the world of business starts thinking about the World Economic Forum -- better known as Davos. For the past three years Davos has been consumed by the eurozone sovereign debt crises. As it worsened the speculation became ever more frantic. The questions were endless: Will Greece leave the euro? Will the eurozone even survive? Was this all just a big German trick to run Europe? The speculation became more extreme, more dramatic, more nonsensical. And so questions were asked of other economies: Can China be the biggest engine of growth for the global economy? Round and round in circles we have gone on these subjects. Frankly, I was starting to wonder if there was anything else to say short of ""it's a horrible mess!"" This year there is a new bogey man. The U.S., and in particular the sorry state of the country's political and budgetary process, will, I have little doubt, be the center of attention. Read more: More 'cliffs' to come in new Congress . Not just because Congress fluffed its big test on the fiscal cliff, but because in doing so it created many more deadlines, any one of which could be deeply unsettling to global markets. There are the $100 billion budget cutbacks postponed for two months by the recent agreement; delayed to the end of February. At exactly the same time, we have the U.S. Treasury's ability to rob Peter to pay Paul on the debt ceiling crisis coming to a head. Read more: Both Obama, GOP set for tough talks ahead . The Treasury's ""debt suspension period"" is an extraordinary piece of financial chicanery. If we tried it with our credit cards, we'd get locked up. Then there is the expiration of the latest continuing resolution, the authority by which Congress is spending money. There is the terrifying prospect that all these budget woes will conflate into one big political fistfight as the U.S. faces cutbacks, default or shutdown. I am being alarmist. Most rational people believe that the worst sting will be taken out of this tail. But not before we have all been to the edge, and back. And that is what the attendees of Davos will have on their minds. People will be speculating about how dysfunctional the U.S. political process has become and whether it is broken beyond repair (if they are not asking that then they should be). They will be pondering which is more serious for risk; the U.S. budget and debt crises or the eurozone sovereign debt debacle. A classic case of being between the devil and the deep blue sea. The official topic this year is Resilient Dynamism. I have absolutely no idea what this means. None whatsoever. It is another of WEF's ersatz themes dreamt up to stimulate debate in what Martin Sorrell has beautifully termed ""Davosian language."" In short, everyone interprets it as they will. What I will enjoy, as I do every year, is the chance to hear the global players speak, and the brightest and best thinkers give us their take on global problems. The atmosphere becomes febrile as the rock-stars of finance and economics give speeches, talk on panels and give insight. Of course nothing comes of these musings, it never does at Davos. That's not the point. This is a chance to take stock and see where the political and economic landmines are in 2013. I like to think of Davos as the equivalent of Control/Alt/Delete. It allows us to reboot. We leave, at least, with an idea of where people stand on the big issues -- provided you can see through the panegyrics of self congratulatory backslapping that always takes place whenever you get like minded people in one place. And this year, I predict the big issue being discussed in coffee bars, salons and fondue houses will be the U.S. and its budgetary woes.","Quest: Davos is a chance to see where the political and economic landmines are in 2013 .

"New York (CNN) -- Jean S. Harris, the headmistress whose trial for the murder of the ""Scarsdale Diet"" doctor captured the attention of a nation with its details of sex and infidelity, has died, her son said Friday. She was 89. Harris died in her sleep Sunday at a retirement community in New Haven, Connecticut, her son James said. When she was arrested for the March 10, 1980, shooting death of longtime lover Herman Tarnower, the celebrity doctor behind the best-selling book ""The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet,"" the case ignited a national debate about whether she was a woman scorned or a victim of abuse. Harris claimed she had driven to Tarnower's house to see him one last time and then kill herself, but accidentally shot him four times during a struggle for the gun. Feminists rallied to her defense, painting the case as that of an aging woman being pushed aside by her lover in favor of a younger woman. The prosecution and her critics said it was a case of jealousy. More than a hundred journalists reportedly turned out to cover the trial, which lasted 14 weeks. Harris met Tarnower in 1966, shortly after she divorced her husband. She was 43. Tarnower was 55. At the time of the killing, she was the headmistress of Madeira School, a private, exclusive all-girls school. During the trial, it was revealed that Tarnower once asked Harris to marry him and then changed his mind because he could not stop seeing other women. Harris accepted Tarnower's position and stayed with him for nearly 14 years. It was during their time together that Tarnower, a cardiologist with a practice in the New York City suburb of Scarsdale, wrote a book touting the benefits of a high-protein, low-fat diet. The book became a bestseller and earned Tarnower millions. During the trial, Harris testified for more than a week about her relationship with Tarnower and the events that led up to the shooting. On the night of the shooting, she said she drove to his house and found him asleep. Then she saw a woman's nightgown and hair curlers and grew enraged after realizing they belonged to Tarnower's 37-year-old nurse, who he had begun taking to parties and other events in Harris' place. According to transcripts, Harris said she pulled her gun out to shoot herself in front on him. When he tried to stop her, she testified, the gun went off. Tarnower was shot four times. The case generated a number of books and two television movies: ""The People Vs. Jean Harris"" in 1981 and ""Mrs. Harris"" in 2006. Harris was convicted by a jury in 1981 of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 15 years to life. She served nearly 12 years before being granted clemency in 1992 by then-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo because of health problems. At her sentencing, she denied murdering Tarnower, saying she loved him. After her release, she established a foundation that raised money for the children of women in prison in New York. In addition to James, she is survived by another son, David. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Jean S. Harris was convicted in 1981 of killing her longtime lover, Dr. Herman Tarnower .

"(CNN) -- Feted as the most talented English player of his generation, whose tears after their semifinal exit of the 1990 World Cup touched a global audience, Paul ""Gazza"" Gascoigne had it all. His working class background and precocious talent drew comparisons with George Best, but like the former Manchester United legend, who died in 2005, the demons of alcohol addiction have taken an ominous toll. ""Alcoholic Paul Gascoigne has been experiencing a tough time of late,"" said his management agency GamePlan Solutions in a statement released to CNN on Tuesday. ""He has been asking for help and has willingly been admitted to a treatment center in America. He has complex issues that are currently being dealt with by professionals. ""Paul has been extremely touched and overwhelmed by the generous offers of help and support over the past few days. He is motivated to fully understand and control his addiction problem under guidance."" Since his playing career ended in 2004, Gascoigne's life has been on a downward spiral as he has battled both the bottle and compulsive disorders. The 45-year-old has been sectioned three times under Britain's Mental Health Act and made regular trips to rehabilitation clinics. Barely coherent . Each time has come promises of a new start, but the grip of addiction manifested itself again last week at a charity event in the Midlands town of Northampton. Barely coherent as he answered questions on stage, he broke down in tears in an appearance lasting less than 10 minutes. Not for the first time, fears for Gascoigne's well being were raised by friends and supporters, including Gary Lineker, a teammate for both England and Tottenham Hotspur. It was Lineker, who famously signaled to the England bench in the semifinal against Germany at Italia 90 after Gascoigne had been yellow carded, meaning the heartbreak of missing the final should the team have made it. Gascoigne's tears of frustration that day formed the basis of Lineker's concern -- now nearly 23 years later, his fears are over a more serious matter. Reacting to the latest sorry incident, Lineker, a respected television presenter, tweeted: ""Lots of you asking for my thoughts on Gazza's plight. I can only hope he finds peace somehow, but fear those hopes may be forlorn."" From outside the game, CNN's Piers Morgan was quick to lend his support to the fallen star. Great support . ""Anyone who knows Paul Gascoigne knows how desperate he is, and has been, to sort himself out. He deserves our sympathy, not ridicule. #Gazza,"" he wrote on his Twitter feed. Lineker and Morgan were reported to have assisted to get Gascoigne admitted to the specialist clinic in Phoenix, Arizona to deal with his alcohol and related problems. Another close friend, former England Test cricketer Ronnie Irani, helped to get Gascoigne on a plane to the United States, as he confirmed in an interview on national radio. ""I had a chat with (BBC radio DJ) Chris Evans and he just asked how we could help him,"" Irani told TalkSport. ""We knew we just had to get him on this flight, out to Phoenix, we just had to get him on the plane. ""I called British Airways and explained the situation, that we had to get him out to Phoenix to get him some help. He needs it, and if not, who knows what's going to happen?"" Irani added: ""It's tough. Mental health issues are a serious, serious subject. ""But sadly he's not been able to help himself. ""So many people rang up yesterday to help Paul Gascoigne, like you could never believe, but the truth is he hasn't been able to help himself."" Gascoigne's precocious talent was first recognized by his local club Newcastle, though his troubled upbringing in an area of the north-east city noted for social deprivation, may well have been the basis for his troubled life. Top talent . But the midfielder's talent on the pitch was undoubted, once taunting opponents by sitting on the ball in the middle of a hotly contested English top division match. Turning down an offer from Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, Gascoigne signed for Tottenham and made his first of his 57 appearances for England shortly afterwards. Then national manager Bobby Robson famously labeled him as ""daft as as brush"" because of his unpredictable and compulsive behavior, but had no complaints as Gascoigne proved central to England's 1990 World Cup success. Robson's predecessor Graham Taylor first flagged up a wider problem, referring to Gascoigne's ""refuelling"" problems -- a clear reference to his liking for alcohol. When Terry Venables, Gascoigne's club manager at Tottenham, took over the England team, he had to cope with the infamous ""Dentist's Chair"" incident in Hong Kong. Supposedly preparing there for Euro 96, Gascoigne and teammates were pictured in a bar sitting in a chair and having alcoholic drinks poured down their throats. After scoring a brilliant individual goal against Scotland in the tournament, Gascoigne lay prone on the Wembley turf and allowed teammates to spray water in his mouth, mimicking the controversy. But eventually the jokes turned sour and off field problems and lack of fitness were cited when Glenn Hoddle left him out of England's squad for the 1998 World Cup. Gascoigne reportedly smashed up his hotel room in response and at the same time was going through a very public divorce from his wife of two years Sheryl. In two subsequent ""bare it all"" autobiographies, Gascoigne admitted to once striking his wife during an argument, asking for forgiveness. Fading career . After spells at Lazio in Serie A and Scotland's Glasgow Rangers, Gascoigne saw out his career with Middlesbrough, Everton, Burnley, a Chinese club Gansu Tianma and lowly Boston United. Since retiring, Gascoigne has tried a career as a TV pundit, briefly coached a non-league side and played in a number of charity matches, still displaying his formidable skills. Interspersed have been appearances in British courts for drunken driving and a drugs offense, but he has narrowly avoided serving a custodial sentence. His fall from grace mirrors that of Best, who battled alcohol problems after his glittering career came to an early end. Northern Ireland's Best died of complications arising from an earlier liver transplant eight years ago and Gordon Taylor, the chief of the Professional Footballers Association (PFA), is worried the same fate could befall Gascoigne. ""We just don't want this to be another George Best tragedy,"" Taylor told BBC national radio. ""He does need a big support system, and he's got it from lots of friends. But there is a frustration that when things look to be improving, it all goes off wire."" Taylor also refuted suggestions that the PFA had not done enough to help Gascoigne.","Former England star Paul Gascoigne in rehab facility in Arizona .

"(CNN) -- The order was to be followed immediately. The entire school was to be put on lockdown. Students, teachers and even administrators were to stay inside; no excuses, no exceptions. The year was 1988. The place; a small mining town in northern Mexico called Cananea. Inside the classrooms, dozens of puzzled high school students were quietly wondering, if they were in danger. I was one of those students. Cananea, in the state of Sonora, just south of Arizona, was back then a quiet town where one could leave doors unlocked without fear. As class president, I felt it was my obligation and duty to my fellow students to find out what was happening. Leading a group of about a half dozen of my classmates, we ventured out, with the acquiescence of our history teacher. Nobody stopped us. As we approached the school's front gate, we heard what sounded like a sizable group of people chanting. The gate was padlocked, so we did what rambunctious children would do in that kind of situation: We jumped over the fence. We walked slowly towards the crowd surrounding a man who appeared to be their leader. He was a balding, chubby man in his 50s with white hair and beard. ""Thanks for coming out to welcome me,"" he told me as he shook my hand. ""You're welcome,"" I replied, probably with a blank stare. I had no idea who the man was. I later learned that his name was Manuel Clouthier. In that presidential election year, the then-53-year-old businessman was running for the highest office in the country as the opposition candidate with the PAN, the National Action Party. Until then, the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) had ruled Mexico with an iron fist for nearly 60 years and it would remain in power for another 12. The party, formed in the wake of the bloody Mexican revolution that ended in 1917, had forged allegiances with unions, business sectors and power brokers so effectively that virtually no one in the country could move a finger without the PRI's blessing. Indeed, the outgoing president selected his successor through a practice known as ""el dedazo,"" roughly meaning ""the finger point."" For all practical purposes, the Mexican media was back then the government's propaganda arm. Clouthier had to leave my town only a few hours after his arrival. No hotel would allow him to stay there. No restaurant would serve him and his people. No business wanted anything to do with him or any opposition party. Doing so would have meant financial ruin or banishment. Fear in those days was highly contagious. That year in July, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the PRI's candidate, won the presidency in one of the most controversial elections in Mexican history. Some Mexican historians still claim that another opposition candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas from the PRD (the Party of the Democratic Revolution), was the real winner of those elections. Manuel Clouthier died a year later in a car crash in his home state of Sinaloa. I've been thinking a lot about that time in my life growing up in Mexico, especially as the country is getting ready to inaugurate a new president Saturday. Much has changed since then. Electoral reforms brought about during the 1990s opened up democracy in Mexico. Clouthier's party, the PAN, finally came to power in 2000 when Vicente Fox won the elections. It was the first time in 71 years that Mexico was going to be governed by a party that was not the PRI. Fox was succeeded by the PAN's Felipe Calderon, who finished his six-year term Saturday. I was in Mexico this July as a CNN correspondent covering this year's presidential elections and, as far as I could see, the process was fair and transparent. I went to multiple polling places around Mexico City. Mexicans were voting openly and without fear. The ghosts of the past, including manipulation, coercion, threats and ""pregnant"" ballot boxes (those already filled with votes), seemed missing. And so Enrique Pena Nieto, a charismatic attorney and former governor of Mexico state, the most populous state in the country and adjacent to Mexico City, won the election this year. He only garnered 38% of the vote, less than the combined total of his three opponents, but that's the way elections work sometimes. As far as I and an army of international observers and journalists could see, he's the legitimate winner. His victory is historically significant because for the first time in 12 years the PRI is back in power. Many in Mexico wonder if Pena Nieto is the new face of an old party. Will he try to forge the same alliances of the past? Will he use unions as coercion arms as the PRI's political machine did in the past? The good news is that, as I said before, much has changed in Mexico. There was no social media in 1988. Today's media, as irresponsible and sensationalist as it can be sometimes, is not driven by the government's agenda. Hope, rather than fear, was the driving factor as Mexicans went to the polls this year. The bad news is that much in Mexico hasn't changed since 1988. Corrupt union leaders remain as powerful as they were back then, if not more. Inequality is painfully omnipresent. Abject poverty makes millions of young people vulnerable to organized crime. And national industries that used to be controlled by the federal government, i.e., the PRI, are now crippling monopolies that inhibit competition and keep prices artificially inflated. Enrique Pena Nieto's six-year presidency is an opportunity for him and a second chance for his party to take Mexico to the next level. Will Mexico remain the country of untapped potential, being almost there, but never quite joining the First World? Or will Pena Nieto and his party capitalize on this historic opportunity to break with old habits of the past for the benefit of the country? Only manana will tell.","Enrique Pena Nieto presidential victory in Mexico is a return to an old, once-corrupt party .
The PRI says it has changed even though its old tools of corruption remain .
As Pena Nieto is inaugurated many are asking: Is he a new man or just a new face?
Success may be measured in his ability to tap Mexico's potential ."
"(CNN) -- The sports insurance company that paid Lance Armstrong more than $10 million in bonuses plans to file a lawsuit to recover its money, an attorney for SCA Promotions told CNN on Wednesday. Jeffrey Tillotson said SCA has already asked the disgraced former cycling champ for the money back. An attorney for Armstrong said the claim has no merit. ""We made our demand for the return of the money we paid him for winning the Tour de France races where the titles were stripped,"" Tillotson told CNN's Ashleigh Banfield. ""Mr. Armstrong and his legal team have not complied with that demand."" Tillotson said the suit, which has not been filed yet, will ask for the return of $12 million in bonus money paid for wins from 2002 to 2005 and for millions in legal costs and interest. Armstrong sued SCA after it delayed his 2005 bonus payment and raised questions about allegations involving his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong testified under oath in that case that he had never doped. SCA settled with Armstrong a year later. ""But both he and his lawyers almost taunted us and said if we are ever stripped of those titles, we will give you the money back,"" Tillotson said Wednesday. ""We will simply ask him to finally live up to his word and give that money back."" Armstrong's attorney, Mark Fabiani, argues the insurance company has no right to the money because of the 2006 settlement agreement, which reads in part, ""no party may challenge, appeal or attempt to set aside the arbitration award."" Fabiani says, ""It is clear as day the insurance company has zero right to reopen the matter."" Tillotson said that Armstrong lied throughout his testimony, not just about whether he had blood doped or taken steroids. ""He lied about virtually everything. And we are going to ask the arbitration panel that heard that testimony to punish him and hold him accountable for it,"" the attorney said. A year ago, federal prosecutors told Armstrong that the two-year investigation into his use of performance enhancing drugs was over. No charges would be filed. ""We made a decision on that case a little over a year ago. Obviously, we've been well aware of the statements that have been made by Mr. Armstrong in other media reports. That has not changed my view at this time,"" United States Attorney Andre Birotte said this week. Now it appears that federal investigators may not be ready to give up just yet. Citing high-level sources, ABC News reported that agents are looking into charges of obstruction, intimidation and witness tampering. A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration, which has been investigating Armstrong, told CNN it's ""an ongoing matter."" Armstrong first admitted the use of performance enhancing drugs and blood doping during a January television interview with Oprah Winfrey, ending years of denial that he cheated during the prime years of his cycling career. He was stripped of his Tour de France titles by international cycling's governing body in October after a damning report by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency accused him and his team of ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program"" in cycling history. The agency said Wednesday that it has been in talks with Armstrong about having him help clean up the sport. Chief executive officer Travis Tygart said Armstrong was granted a two-week extension to Wednesday's deadline to tell the USADA whether he will help or not. USADA has banned Armstrong, 41, for life but did say the ban could be reduced to eight years if he cooperated under oath with investigators. Armstrong's cycling career is long over, but he competed in and won several triathlons in 2012. Armstrong told Cycling News in late January that he thought a truth and reconciliation commission, run by the World Anti-Doping Agency, was the ""only way forward."" At the time he said WADA should run the probe, not the USADA, ""This is a global sport, not an American one. One thing I'd add, the (International Cycling Union) has no place at the table."" Since Lance Armstrong's interview with Winfrey, the disgraced cyclist has disappeared from public view. Once prolific on Twitter, he hasn't tweeted in nearly a month, and his profile page now ends with these words of wisdom: ""Met patience in 1996 but only now am I getting to know and appreciate her."" CNN's Ed Lavandera reported from Dallas. Steve Almasy reported and wrote this story in Atlanta. CNN's Jason Morris and Joe Sutton also contributed to this story.","NEW: U.S. Anti-Doping Agency gives Armstrong more time to consider request to testify .

"(CNN) -- Bob Costas and Piers Morgan couldn't agree more on one thing: Something has to be done about the pervasive gun culture in the United States. And that problem, Costas said, becomes even more of an issue when you pair it with the culture of the National Football League, which has seen its share of tragic events, including the recent Jovan Belcher murder-suicide. NBC sportscaster Costas sat down with CNN's Piers Morgan on Monday night to discuss the growing debate over gun control. Both have faced criticism after taking on the issue -- Costas during a recent halftime show of a ""Sunday Night Football"" game and Morgan on Twitter. Costas said the issue is a growing one, especially for NFL players, many of whom reportedly say they carry a weapon for security or some of whom have been arrested. So does Costas think that Belcher's suicide after killing the mother of his child means the league is at a breaking point? ""I don't know if it approaches crisis; perhaps it does, but it's at a crossroads because there's an issue about the fundamental nature of the game. It's so popular and so profitable, but it takes a tremendous toll on many of those who play it. Not just body, but as we're now learning, mind and emotions,"" Costas said on ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""And it's a legitimate question to ask whether, for some players at least, the toll that the game takes, brain trauma, medications that they may take, enhance performance or deal with pain, all those things. The culture of the league increases the likelihood of abhorrent behavior. It's possible."" Costas said regardless of what side of the gun debate you fall on, there is a simple rule that cannot be debated. ""It is infinitely more likely that something bad will happen if you're armed than something good will happen,"" he told Morgan. Shortly before the taping of the Costas-Morgan interview, a shooting occurred not far from the CNN headquarters in New York. It's an example, Morgan said, of how pervasive guns are and also how numb Americans have become to a dangerous issue. Costas said the real problem is the way guns have of escalating a situation. His case in point: George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin. Putting aside the facts of the case or race concerns, Costas asked one simple question. ""What does common sense tell you about the likelihood of that confrontation ever taking place in the first place if George Zimmerman was not carrying a gun? It is a comment you might not have expected months ago from Costas. He said he never intended to create a pulpit of any kind but he felt he had to say something following Belcher's suicide. Should Bob Costas have spoken out on Belcher suicide? And while critics argued a halftime show wasn't the time or the place for the debate, Costas said he couldn't remain quiet. The comments that followed mostly trashed Costas for speaking out. ""It wasn't my intent to become a spokesperson in any way for this issue,"" Costas told Morgan. ""But if no matter how imperfectly I may have done it a week ago Sunday, if this has sparked a conversation and in some small way influenced people's behavior, so much the better."" It was not lost on him that many people took him to task for only speaking out about guns. And on Monday night, Costas addressed those critics. ""Jovan Belcher had eight guns. And for those who, by the way, say what if (his girlfriend) Kasandra Perkins had a gun; there were guns in that house,"" he said. ""She'd have to have it holstered like she's Wild Bill Hickok in the old West to have it at the ready when Jovan Belcher came barging through the door."" But comments on Twitter kept flying: What if it were a stabbing? What if it were drunken driving? Or what about the situation with the Dallas Cowboys, with Josh Brent being arrested on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter after being in a crash that killed teammate Jerry Brown Jr. ""It's tough to tangentially link it to what happened with Jovan Belcher, but obviously it's a case of bad judgment,"" Costas said. Costas recalled a story of former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy asking 80 players at training camp how many had guns and 65 raising their hands. ""Even if those guns were legally obtained, what do you think over time would be the ratio between unintended and tragic consequences, including accidents, but also including times when people just snapped and impulse got in the way, anger got in the way?"" Costas said. ""The ratio of that as against the times that the gun would be used for a good outcome for legitimate self-defense. It's common sense to see where that's going to wind up."" Morgan said during his debates on Twitter he had constantly been asked about the times that guns were helpful. But Morgan said he found the pro-gun lobbyist debate to be harmful for the country. ""A certain type of pro-gun lobbyist twists, I believe, this debate, in a very unhealthy way,"" Morgan said. ""They always say it's never the gun, it's always the person, with a clear indication that the people are evil and they perpetrate evil with guns."" Opinion: Give gun owners what they want . Morgan rattled off three tragic stories in a four-day period: . ""December 5, a 4-year-old boy accidentally shot and killed his younger brother in Minneapolis with his father's handgun in the home. December 6, a 7-year-old finds his grandfather's gun -- this is in Philadelphia -- and shoots his sister,"" Morgan said. ""December 9, a 7-year-old boy (is) shot dead when his father's handgun went off in a parking lot of a Western Pennsylvania gun store."" Costas said those are exactly the circumstances he thinks we need to try and avoid. He noted there are many instances of legitimate self-defense. But in his opinion, they don't outweigh ""how many bad things happen because of an attitude toward guns in this country."" ""That's what I was trying to get at on that Sunday night. And my mistake was, and I've acknowledged this, normally, we have about 2Â½ minutes. That's tight enough. Here we had only 90 seconds,"" Costas said. ""I alluded in a general way to the culture of football but didn't have time to enumerate it. But those who think that I was reluctant to hold the NFL to account are not familiar with my work. Because almost alone among network sports broadcasters, I have made many points about the culture of the NFL, asked many questions of (NFL Commissioner) Roger Goodell and NFL officials, and continue to -- plan to do so in the future. ""Are drugs involved, alcohol involved? Yes, all those things. But guns are among them. It seems that some people want it to be about everything and anything but guns. I don't think it's only about guns, but I think that guns, even if legally obtained, people's attitudes toward guns are definitely a part of this problem."" Opinion: Manhood, football and suicide . Costas said he understands why many people feel the need to have a gun, whether it is for safety in their home or elsewhere. ""Over the course of a year, how often do you think that would lead to tragedy and how often do you think it would lead to safety? That's my question.""

"(CNN) -- Despite what his past and current on-screen personas might suggest, in person, actor Michael Kenneth Williams is extremely cordial and not at all criminal-minded. Williams is probably best known for his role as gay stick-up boy Omar Little on HBO's ""The Wire"" and currently plays bootlegger Chalky White on ""Boardwalk Empire."" And while the actor is set to play Wu-Tang Clan member Ol' Dirty Bastard in a forthcoming film about the rapper, Williams is most excited about his new role as an executive producer. ""When I saw this on YouTube, I had no idea what I was watching. I was like, are the feds going to run up in here and ask me what I know?! It was that eerie,"" the Brooklyn-born Williams said of his latest project, the independent film ""Snow on tha Bluff,"" which will be released on DVD June 19. In what Williams calls "" 'The Blair Witch Project' meets the hood,"" ""Snow on tha Bluff"" documents real-life stick-up boy Curtis Snow. Snow's robberies of rival dealers, gunfights and life in the West Atlanta neighborhood known as ""tha Bluff"" are all documented via handheld camera footage, leaving viewers to guess what is and isn't real. Williams caught wind of the film via a trailer that leaked on Twitter. From there, Williams reached out the director, asked to be an executive producer and offered to do what he could to promote the film and tell Snow's story, which he got to know more of when they met in tha Bluff. The film is being released via Williams' new production company, Freedome Productions. While Snow was quick to get caught up in the hype of Williams' characters, the latter made clear it's not his fictional accounts that deserve credit; it's the real-life people who inspire them. ""I said, 'I commend you. I get paid to be you, what you really are,' "" Williams said. ""He didn't make excuses for who and what he was, and it kind of reminded me in a weird sense of Omar."" Among fans (counted among that group is President Barack Obama), Omar Little has been dubbed the best character on ""The Wire"" and is the role Williams is probably best known for. Williams also said playing the fearless, drug-dealer-robbing and seemingly invincible Omar actually put him in a dark place. ""Everybody loved Omar. Everybody respected him. I didn't have that growing up. I had issues,"" Williams admitted. ""When I got this unconditional love from everybody and people perceived me as not caring what you thought about me, that felt good even though it was not real. It cost me."" Williams said he also dealt with his own ""racism"" with ""The Wire,"" especially when the first season with a predominantly black cast was followed with a second season with more white characters. He took his concerns to the show's creator, David Simon. ""I got real bitter and angry,"" he said of his initial response. ""I was like, 'Yo, what's up with that? That's kind of corny.' He was like, 'Trust me, if we would have went right back into the hood in season two, it would have made your world seem so small.' "" After his chat with Simon, Williams said, he realized the show was more of a portrait of America's social breakdown, not just black America. From there, Williams knew he wanted to tell more stories like those in and around West Baltimore, where the ""The Wire"" was filmed. Williams does believe race may have played into why neither he nor the show ever won a Primetime Emmy during his five successful seasons. ""I don't think Hollywood was ready to have that many young black actors running around with statues in the town,"" he said, noting that the lack of a statue can't come close to the career opportunities he's been provided, thanks to the show's success. With that success has been the ability to help bring awareness to the real people behind ""Snow on tha Bluff"" and the chance to bring a real human element to the story of Ol' Dirty Bastard in film ""Dirty White Boy."" One of the most successful and notorious personalities of the legendary hip-hop collective the Wu-Tang Clan, Ol' Dirty Bastard lived a story of music, drugs and violence, which came to a sad conclusion with the rapper's death from an accidental drug overdose in November 2004. In his first leading role in a major film, Williams is set to play the iconic artist in the last two years of his life, as seen through the eyes of his manager, Jarred Weisfeld, a former VH1 intern. Like the man himself, the movie about Ol' Dirty Bastard's life has been fodder for debate over everything from the title to the subject matter. Williams' focus is portraying the truth about the man behind the music. ""He wasn't held up in no crack house. He wasn't on no bender. He died in a recording studio. It was just a very unfortunate accident how he lost his life,"" said Williams, who did most of his research for the role by spending time with the late rapper's mother. ""She didn't make any excuses for 'Rusty,' as she calls him. But she let you know, when he died, he wasn't on a suicide mission. He was very excited about his future. The things he struggled with personally -- outside of the business -- that could've been anybody. I want people to walk away with an identity to his story."" From Snow to Omar to Ol' Dirty Bastard, Williams believes he has found his calling. ""I feel like I've been given an opportunity to paint people that society would deem as 'the gangster,' 'the thug,' as a human being with raw emotions,"" he said. ""I'm being given chance to be a voice for a people that don't get a voice.""","Michael Kenneth Williams is stepping behind the camera as producer of a new film .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The president of Tokyo Electric Power Company, the business at the heart of Japan's nuclear crisis, apologized again Wednesday, a day after the situation there was designated a Chernobyl-level nuclear accident. Masataka Shimizu, the president of the power company, also said he is working with the government to create a plan to privide short-term compensation to the many affected by the nuclear crisis. ""I regret the fact we are inconveniencing all these people, I want to take this opportunity to apologize,"" Shimizu said. His speech comes after Japan's prime minister vowed to wind down the month-long crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant ""at all costs."" Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he wants Tokyo Electric Power Company, to produce a timetable for bringing the disaster to an end, ""and they will be doing that soon."" Shimizu did not provide a detailed timetable during his speech Wednesday but said his company is working to stop harmful materials from going into the atmosphere ""as soon as possible."" Japan declared the Fukushima Daiichi crisis a Level 7 event on the international system for rating nuclear accidents Tuesday, putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. The top-scale designation was based on the massive release of radioactivity since the accident began, particularly in its early days, and classifies Fukushima Daiichi a ""major accident"" requiring long-term countermeasures. ""At all costs, all the reactors and the spent nuclear fuel pools must be brought under control so that we can prevent a further expansion of the damage,"" Kan said. Tetsunari Iida, a former nuclear engineer-turned-industry critic, told CNN the declaration has no immediate practical impact on the crisis. But it's a sign that Japanese regulators have rethought their earlier assessments of the disaster, said Iida, who now runs an alternative energy think-tank in Tokyo. Shimizu already issued an apology Tuesday for the disaster and the ""enormous anxiety"" it has caused after the Level 7 designation. ""We would like to stabilize the situation as soon as possible, and we are working on the measures and steps to cool the reactors and prevent the spread of nuclear substances,"" he said. ""While continuing to ask for the support and cooperation of the government, the ministries, and the municipalities, we would like to maintain close communication with them, and we will make the utmost effort to bring the situation to an end."" Scientists believe the amount of radiation released is only a tenth of what was released at Chernobyl, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, the chief spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. But the levels for radioactive iodine and cesium that have been spewed into the air, water and soil around the plant are in the thousands of trillions of bequerels -- 15 times higher than the threshold for a top-scale event, according to figures released by the safety agency Tuesday morning. The crisis began with the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Japan. The tsunami knocked out the plant's cooling systems, leaving operators with no way to keep the three operational reactors from overheating after they shut down. Engineers are now pumping hundreds of tons of water a day into the damaged reactors to keep them cool, but Tokyo Electric said long-term solutions must wait until it can get the highly contaminated water out of the basements of the units' turbine plants. In addition, more water is being poured into pools housing spent but still-potent fuel rods in units 1-3 as well as unit 4, which had no fuel in the reactor at the time of the quake. The work has been complicated over the past five days by a series of powerful aftershocks that have forced workers to clear out of the units and seek shelter. Evacuation orders have so far covered about 85,000 people inside the 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) zone, while another 62,000 within 30 kilometers have been told to stay inside, Fukushima prefecture officials told CNN. Japan's government said it had no estimate of the number of people who would be covered by the new directives. Yukio Edano, the country's chief cabinet secretary, added outdoor-grown shiitake mushrooms from 16 towns and villages neighboring the Daiichi plant to the country's banned food list Wednesday. CNN's Kyung Lah, Whitney Hurst, Junko Ogura, Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Tokyo Electric's president says he is creating a plan for short-term payments for victims .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- French-led forces battling Islamist rebels seized the town of Tessalit in northern Mali on Friday, France's defense ministry said. Following air strikes, special forces parachuted in to secure the airport, while an armored infantry regiment moved in on the ground, the ministry said. Chadian forces participated in the operation, which came the same day that a suicide bomber blew himself up at a checkpoint, the first known attack of its kind since the launch of the French-led offensive. The attack by a teenager occurred in the city of Gao, authorities said. One Malian soldier was killed. ""The man approached the soldiers at the checkpoint on a motorbike. As soon as he got close, he set off the bomb,"" said Capt. Oumar Maiga, a spokesman for the Mali army. French-led troops launched the effort to flush out militants in the north last month. They now control Timbuktu and Gao, along with a swath in between the two that was an Islamist stronghold for almost a year. The ground and air campaign has sent Islamist fighters who had seized the northern region fleeing into the desert and rugged terrain nearby. What's behind the instability in Mali? However, some militants lingered, hiding among residents in the villages. ""Unfortunately, we expected the Islamists to return to these type of attacks as they were driven out of the city,"" said Lt. Col. Philippe at the French army base in Gao. The attack is the latest setback for Malian forces. Three weeks ago, three soldiers were killed when they hit a mine near Douentza in the central region. The monthlong French offensive has killed ""hundreds"" of Islamist fighters in Mali, the French defense minister said this week, as his troops prepared to start withdrawing. France, Mali's former colonizer, has said it expects to begin pulling out its troops in March and leave African forces in control. Mali: The long, troubled desert road ahead . Despite the withdrawal, troops will continue operations to flush out militants in ""some terrorist havens"" in northern Mali, French officials said. Islamic extremists carved out a large portion of the north last year after a chaotic military coup. They banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and they destroyed historic tombs and shrines in the region. World leaders feared that the al Qaeda-linked militants would turn the area into a terrorist haven. Six reasons events in Mali matter .

"Washington (CNN) -- Spirit Airlines says a pilot who clipped the tail of another aircraft on New Year's Eve was not warned about the presence of the other plane. The accident happened after Spirit Flight 403 arrived at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida with 167 passengers onboard. The wingtip of the Airbus A320 hit the tail of a US Airways plane, also an A320, parked in a remote stand away from the gate; no one was onboard that plane. ""Spirit was not advised by air traffic control of the presence of the other aircraft,"" the company said in a press release issued Wednesday night said. ""Spirit has been informed by officials that the control tower had also not been advised that the other A320 was parked in such close proximity to an active taxiway."" ""We are continuing to investigate,"" US Airways spokesman Andrew Christie told CNN Wednesday. The day before, he said the ""A320 was parked in an approved parking spot when it was struck in the tail by another aircraft."" The accident happened in an area which is not under air traffic control, a FAA official who did not want to be identified discussing the details of the accident told CNN. Controllers generally guide planes on runways and active taxiways, but it would be unusual for them to discuss aircraft that are in parking areas with pilots who are taxiing past them. Radio calls captured by the website LiveATC.net show the Spirit pilot warned ground control about limited space to maneuver. ""You might want to send guys around the other way, it's really tight here in Cactus Park,"" he said using ""Cactus"" the US Airways radio call sign. No one was injured in the collision and the passengers onboard the Spirit flight deplaned at the gate. The airline says because of the minor nature of the damage the National Transportation Safety Board will not be investigating. In September, the NTSB recommended the FAA require large planes and other aircraft on which the wingtips are not easily visible from the cockpit to have cameras or other devices to monitor the wings. The safety board said at the time that 12 accidents since 1993 had involved a large aircraft's wingtip hitting another airplane or object on the taxiway. Most recently, a Boeing 747 hit a regional jet at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in May, a 767 hit a regional jet in Boston in July 2011 and an A380 hit a regional jet in April of 2011 at New York's JFK Airport. No one was injured in any of those incidents.","Spirit says pilot not advised about presence of other aircraft .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the fiscal challenges facing our country, Republicans always insist on taking the hard road. They nearly set off a recession by waiting until just after New Year's Eve to agree to keep taxes from rising for millions of middle-class families. They caused the first credit downgrade in our country's history by threatening a catastrophic default. And now they seem ready -- even eager -- to let painful automatic spending cuts take effect, which would result in the loss of at least a million jobs. The good news is there's an easier path. Obama calls for short-term fix to imminent spending cuts . We can stop this self-inflicted wound to our economy -- and we must -- but we have to act fast. There are many common sense ways to reduce our deficit and avert the sequester, which would hit defense and domestic programs with $1.2 trillion in indiscriminate cuts over 10 years. While we have started discussing some of these ideas at the Senate Democratic retreat this week, here are few of mine: . -- We should begin by applying the nearly $700 billion in savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward reducing the deficit and avoiding these automatic cuts. -- We should let Medicare negotiate drug prices, which would save as much as $200 billion over 10 years and lower drug costs for seniors. -- And we should crack down on tax fraud and corporate tax evasion, which could help save more than $100 billion a year. These three proposals alone could help us save nearly $2 trillion over 10 years. They are popular with the public and would help us address our long-term fiscal challenges. These savings would build on the almost $1.5 trillion in spending cuts that we have already approved since President Barack Obama took office, which are helping to reduce our deficits to the lowest level in five years. House Republicans have offered their alternative to avoiding the sequester, known as ""Plan C."" The plan would spare the Pentagon any pain, but it would slash investments that benefit the middle class, seniors, children and the poor -- from child lunches to cancer research to meals on wheels programs. That's not a solution -- it's a recipe for disaster. We can do better. Americans got a wake-up call last week when the GDP figures were released, showing that our economy shrank by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012. A massive dose of austerity is exactly the wrong prescription for our country right now. The president was right when he said on Tuesday that our economy is heading in the right direction and will continue to do so as long as Congress does not inflict more damage. Our top priority should be strengthening the economy, and that includes preserving critical investments in things such as education, transportation and medical research that create jobs. When it comes to reducing our debt, let's take the easy path. That means a balanced approach of new revenues and sensible spending cuts that will keep our economy growing and protect American families. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barbara Boxer.","Barbara Boxer: There are many ways to reduce our deficit and avert the sequester .

"(CNN) -- Justice was done Friday as Burkina Faso star Jonathan Pitroipa was cleared to play his part in the nation's quest for Africa Cup of Nations glory. Pitroipa, who was wrongly sent off by referee Slim Jdidi during the semifinal win against Ghana, was left devastated after being shown a red card in the 117th minute. But after Thursday's decision to suspend the Tunisian official, which followed an error-strewn performance, the Confederation of African Football has given its permission for Pitroipa to play. AFCON referee suspended . ""The red card is withdrawn,"" CAF secretary general Hicham El Amrani told journalists after the disciplinary commission's decision.

But to know that I will take to the pitch with my teammates makes me very happy."" What can we expect from the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations? And CAF president Issa Haytaou confirmed that the Rennes man will be allowed to play following an admission of error by Jdidi in his match report. ""Everyone realised that this referee did not officiate well,"" Issa Hayatou told reporters. ""They have told me the referee has sent a letter saying he got it wrong.

""It is good news for Burkina Faso, for the team and especially for Jonathan because he is a player who did not deserve to be suspended,"" Burkina Faso coach Paul Put told AFP.

Last year, Burkina Faso lost all three matches and was fortunate to make the finals after fielding an ineligible player in a qualifier against Namibia.

"on board the California Zephyr (CNN) -- Woooooh... Wooooh. The very sound of the Amtrak train horn is among the most evocative bits of Americana. It conjures up images of giant locomotives, ploughing their way across the country. With romantic names like ""The Texas Eagle,"" ""The Silver Meteor,"" ""The City of New Orleans,"" and my home for the next week, ""The California Zephyr."" The train is America. Because while the horse and covered wagon gave rise to the frontier spirit, it was the country's railroad that propelled this vast nation into becoming an economic powerhouse. The West may have been won on horseback, but it was the train that carried the swathes of victors to those newly claimed lands. The railroads became the backbone of the country. Transporting labor from one side to the other and the goods they produced to the entire country. Obama country: The start of CNN's American Quest . In tough times the railways that criss-crossed the nascent country served to bind the federation together after the trauma of civil war; they enabled the breadbasket of America's Great Plains to send the crops they grew to feed the rest of the country. As the industrial revolution took hold the new giant steel mills, coal mines and factories of the Mid-West took advantage of the opportunities rail created to reach growing cities, and docks to export overseas. Put simply, America's railroads built the nation that exists today. But having built the country, by the 20th century the railroads found themselves in an impossible place. They fell victim to the individualism inherent in the new motor car and then the speed inherent in air travel. Rail was in a distant third place. By the 1970s, rail travel was in deep decline, and Amtrak was founded in an attempt to arrest its fall. In a major development, Congress legislated control of the passenger railways and gave it to Amtrak. It began service on May 1, 1971, with 21 routes spanning 43 states. Amtrak was a patchwork of stations, routes and services, which frequently failed to make much sense. Throughout its life Amtrak has made the argument, repeatedly, that rail is the most cost-effective and environmentally sound form of travel. Far from being sidelined, it has pleaded for greater investment to open up new high-speed routes and encourage more ridership. In some parts of the country it has enjoyed spectacular success in its battle with air travel. Between New York and Washington the train dominates, with 75% of the market, including via its high speed Acela service. For the north east corridor from Boston to Washington, Amtrak carried 11 million passengers last year, 36% of Amtrak's total number of riders. The north-east remains fortress Amtrak; but in parts of the country where you'd think it would be the preferred way to travel, such as Chicago to Detroit, or St. Louis, it is still has a long way to go in increasing its market share. To hear Amtrak's critics, including Mitt Romney, you would think the train company was swimming in public cash. But while last year the entire network received a total of $1.4 billion in operating and capital subsidies, in this year's presidential election the Republicans have threatened to do away with the subsidy. But away from these current hostilities, politics and the railways have actually long been brothers. No election campaign during the 1800s would be complete without a ""whistle-stop tour"" - when candidates would charter trains and speak to the voters from the caboose. An iconic picture in American political history is a victorious Harry Truman standing on the back of a train, holding an early edition newspaper reporting his defeat. The 1996 election saw Bill Clinton campaigning his way across America by rail. Amtrak's annual report from that year says, ""When the presidential candidates wanted to travel across the country with speed, they flew; but when they wanted to make a statement, to see the countryside and to create a symbol of being in touch with America's roots, they took Amtrak."" To help increase its appeal today Amtrak runs magnificent trains across America appealing to the tourist and those wanting a more relaxed form of travel. Double deck carriages and panoramic windows offer interstate travel for those seeking a more leisurely journey. And that is where you find me today -- on board the California Zephyr. It is one of Amtrak's most famous services, taking 48 hours from Chicago to San Francisco, making 34 stops on the way, across seven states. On the first sector of the journey, my accommodations include a ""roomette"" with a couchette for sleeping. Later on I will have a family-sized cabin to stretch out in as we cross Nebraska. In the days ahead I will tell you much more about life on the Amtrak train -- for now, let me just leave you with the thought that there remain few better ways of discovering the many faces of the real America than to visit by rail, especially in an election year.","Railroad propelled United States into becoming economic powerhouse .

The joint forces faced little resistance, the African Union Mission for Somalia said in a press release, adding that Jowhar had been a major base for Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia. Abdi Isac, a local resident, said by phone from Jowhar that the allied troops peacefully entered the city after the Islamist militants pulled out without a fight or firing a single shot. Government forces and AU tanks were visible encircling the town and moving cautiously into the police stations and administrative offices in Jowhar to secure the city, residents said. The Al-Shabaab fighters headed toward the nearby rural area that is their stronghold, reports said. Jowhar, 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, lies at a strategic crossroads of routes to the north and south of the country. The capture of the town ""will go a long way towards improving security for the civilian population"" in the region, the AU commander said, according to the press release. The rebels continue to hold small rural areas in central and southern Somalia but are being squeezed out of some parts by Kenyan and Ethiopian troops, which launched incursions inside Somalia in October 2011 in support of the beleaguered Western-backed Somali government.","Somali National Army and African Union troops take control of town of Jowhar, AU says .

"London (CNN) -- Disgraced TV star Jimmy Savile lobbied former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for government money to help fund a hospital unit, newly released archive documents reveal. UK TV host Savile died last year aged 84 but police are now investigating claims of sexual abuse during his long broadcasting career, saying they are dealing with about 300 apparent victims -- mostly girls who were in their mid-teens at the time. Who was Jimmy Savile? The papers released Friday include a hand-written note thanking the then prime minster for a lunch invitation and shows Savile's familiarity with, and admiration for Margaret Thatcher. ""My girl patients pretended to be madly jealous and wanted to know what you wore and what you ate,"" Savile writes, adding: ""They all love you. Me too!!"" In 1980 Savile was trying to raise Â£10 million ($16 million) for Stoke Mandeville Hospital and asked Thatcher's advice about tax deductions for charity. She wrote back to express her own interest in the subject and later to inform him that the rules for charity donations had been changed in the budget, explaining that ""the period for which covenants to charity must be capable of running is being reduced from seven years to four so that people will no longer have to commit themselves to such a long time."" Documents released by the UK's National Archives further reveal that they met on several occasions. A note from a prime minister's aide shows that in 1981 Savile asked her if the government would consider a grant for the hospital as a ""goodwill gesture"" to all the people who had donated. Subsequent memos demonstrate that government advisers were sensitive about a financial commitment and pressed the prime minister to let them know if she had made Savile a promise about offering money for Stoke Mandeville or agreed to appear on his TV show ""Jim'll fix it."" Read more: Inquiry slams BBC managers over Savile probe response . The government eventually agreed to give Â£500,000 ($800,000) to help rebuild the hospital's spinal injuries unit. Other documents released Friday under the UK's 30-year rule detail the handling of the conflict in the southern Atlantic in 1982 after Argentina invaded the Falklands Islands. Testimony in the archive reveals Thatcher's surprise at the invasion, describing it as ""the worst... moment of my life."" In evidence given to the Falkland Islands Review Committee in October 1982, and some months after the war ended, Thatcher said there were no warning signs from Argentina since its 1977 statement saying there would be talks. ""I never, never expected the Argentines to invade the Falklands head-on,"" she told the committee. ""It was such a stupid thing to do, as events happened, such a stupid thing even to contemplate doing. ""I saw on March 3 that we must make contingency plans. Even then I did not think it would happen. The first time that I actually realized was on the Wednesday before... but I never believed that they would invade,"" the released papers quote her as saying. Read more: Scandal-hit BBC appoints new director general . The files also show that Thatcher's cabinet was trying to pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis through the help of then U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, whilst also preparing a military response. Thatcher made clear that the UK government would negotiate with Argentina but that ""the immediate requirement was for Argentine troops to leave the Falkland Islands and for British administration to be restored. The prime minister added that she would be ""guided by the wishes of the islanders."" Documents show the UK government also refused to give an undertaking that the military task force (at that time on its way to the south Atlantic) would be halted ""much less turned back"" during a period of any Argentine military withdrawal.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Elizabeth and Mary Profit will not be taking center court at the U.S. Open women's doubles final to face Venus and Serena Williams, but they share many of the athletic qualities that have made Venus and Serena the most dominant sisters in tennis history. Elizabeth Profit plays tennis while wearing an insulin monitor at her waist in this family photo. Elizabeth is 13 years old and holds a top ten ranking among 14-year-olds in Southern California. She is already defeating top-ranked players in the 18-year-old division. Her sister Mary, at 11, is also a top-ranked player and dominating her age group. Mary won her first tournament at the age of 6. Both girls started playing tennis as infants by hitting balls of socks across their living room. Their mother, Yvonne Profit, recognized their talent and saw it as an opportunity to develop sportsmanship and character and help them earn athletic scholarships at top national universities. So far, they have exceeded her expectations. In a sport that more often tends to develop players from affluent backgrounds, Elizabeth and Mary have already beaten overwhelming odds and endured the kind of adversity that too often ends in defeat.  Watch how the sisters hope to achieve their tennis dreams » . The Profit sisters grew up in a single-parent household and trained with less than stellar coaches. They developed an exemplary work ethic to compensate for a lack of resources, Elizabeth said. Yvonne, who earned a degree at the University of Michigan, decided to give up her full-time job and move her daughters into an RV to keep up with the rigorous demands of traveling for tournaments. Elizabeth sleeps on a couch. There is a portable stove and shower. But the girls view living in an RV as an inconvenience rather than a hardship. The Profit sisters may be on a path toward a professional tennis career, but Elizabeth's story off the court is just as compelling. She has juvenile diabetes and has been living with the disease since the age of 2, when her body stopped producing insulin. Elizabeth learned how to test her blood sugar levels before the age of 3 and two years later, she began administering insulin injections on her own. ""My mom said I'm not going use my diabetes as a disability,"" said Elizabeth. ""I've got it for the rest of my life. And if they miraculously find a cure for it then that's great, but I have to live with it. I can't make excuses."" Until she learned how to manage diabetes, Elizabeth found herself collapsing at times. ""In this one particular tournament Elizabeth played in, her blood sugar was totally out of control and I kept hollering out to her, 'Quit! Retire, you don't have to do this,' "" said Yvonne. ""She stopped and she turned around and said, 'I can do this. I can do this, Mom.' "" Elizabeth went on to win the match and the tournament. ""By the time we got home, she had collapsed on the floor. And I said, 'Sweetie pie, why didn't you quit?' "" Yvonne remembered. ""Because you didn't raise me to be a quitter,"" Elizabeth told her mother. In spite of her diabetes, Elizabeth reached the No. 1 ranking in her age group in Southern California at 10 years old. Her sister Mary knows that diabetes can be debilitating and a matter of life and death, so she constantly watches over her older sister. ""Sometimes when I wake up to go to the bathroom, I check her blood sugar, when my mom's sleeping,"" said Mary. ""Sometimes I wake up and give her something if her blood sugar is low."" For the past ten years, Yvonne said, she has been unable to obtain private health insurance on the open market for her daughter because diabetes is considered a pre-existing medical condition. Elizabeth used to rely on a large insulin pump to make it through the day, but now she wears a small patch that releases insulin. Despite the inconvenience of checking her blood sugar level a dozen times a day, Elizabeth has not let diabetes deter her from achieving her goals. ""At 17, I hope to see myself in the quarters of the U.S. Open like Melanie Oudin,"" she said. ""I hope to win some grand slams and get that No. 1 ranking."" Elizabeth's advice to anyone with diabetes is universal. ""I'd say if you give up, you're going to have to look back on your life and say, 'Oh I could have done this, I could have done that,' "" she said. ""You don't want to let life pass you by. You're going to have so many years to live, so you might as well have fun while you do it. And once you die, you're going to have a legacy behind, so make your life as fun as you can."" Next year, Yvonne is planning to enter Elizabeth on the women's professional tour, at the same age that Serena and Venus Williams turned pro.","Tennis player Elizabeth Profit, 13, ranks high in her age group; to turn pro next year .

"Waco, Texas (CNN) -- A strong wind blows across the Spirit Wild Ranch. A tornado is on its way and the American flag on the great lawn waves fiercely. I am sitting in an enormous tree with Ted Nugent on one of the many hunting perches scattered around his Texas ranch. This is Shemane's Grove, named after his wife of more than 20 years. Oryx, deer, wild turkey and blackbuck antelope roam the 300-acre property. During hunting season they are all fair game. Nugent sits up there for hours, he says, sometimes with a gun but often with a bow and arrow, waiting for the right moment when he can kill his prey with a single shot through the heart and lungs. As we sit, he draws back an imaginary bow, speaking slowly and rhythmically, describing ""the mystical flight of the arrow."" Then he lets the imaginary arrow fly. To him hunting is ""Zen meditation in its definitive form, plus you get meat out of it,"" he says, laughing. Nugent is spiritually connected to this land. ""Can you feel it? Can you feel it?"" he asks excitedly. At home with the Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent . The platinum-selling rocker and National Rifle Association board member has invited us to his ranch to understand hunting, self-defense and the Second Amendment right to bear arms from the perspective of law-abiding gun-owners. After setting up targets on a makeshift shooting range, he hands me a semi-automatic rifle, similar to the one used by the gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary to kill 26 people. AR stands for ArmaLite rifle not assault rifle, Nugent explains, blaming the shooter, not the gun itself. ""It's not the weapons. The weapons had nothing to do with it. These weapons are in every pickup in Texas. People have to get past the hardware,"" says Nugent, pointing out that a pheasant shotgun in the wrong hands can be as deadly. Talk Back: Should Ted Nugent attend SOTU? He can't seem to understand why people who disagree with him won't or can't see it that way. He sticks to his message with a rocker's flair for hyperbole and provocation. ""There is no gun violence,"" he says. ""There is only criminal violence and they use an assortment of tools."" He rattles off statistics to support his argument: more people killed by drunken drivers, more people drowned. When I point out that a deranged 20-year-old like the Sandy Hook shooter is unlikely to round up first-graders and drown them, he quiets down. ""Understood,"" he nods. Then without missing a beat, Nugent picks up the thread of his argument. ""The gun owners of America are causing no problem. Leave us alone. Let's go after the mentally deranged who are doing all these vicious crimes. Let's go after the recidivistic maggots that judges and prosecutors unleash into our neighborhoods."" Opinion: Obama, stop trying to appease unfair critics . As we drive around his ranch in an all-terrain vehicle, Nugent stops at various points to restock his feeders as a supplement for the animals that he says breed year-round. I ask whether his opinion on guns would change if someone in his family were killed. Not surprisingly, he says ""No,"" calling guns a ""wonderful tool"" for self-defense, competition and sport. Nugent is among the harshest critics of President Barack Obama (""not a hunting buddy""), Attorney General Eric Holder and any lawmaker who would restrict his or any citizen's access to guns. He laughs off as naÃ¯ve and ridiculous the notion that no one wants to take Americans' guns away. He supports background checks for new guns and for licensed gun show dealers but rejects gun registration, gun licensing, private sale background checks and limiting access to any existing firearms, saying people who want to ban access to certain types of weapons know almost nothing about guns. Though Nugent understands the nation's desire to stop another gun massacre, he says focusing on criminals and those with mental illnesses will have a bigger impact than trying to ban the more than 310 million guns or billions of high capacity magazines that currently exist in North America. As for high capacity magazines, Nugent says limiting bullets is counter to the Second Amendment right to self-defense, ""When I'm being assaulted at my home, I and I alone, by any consideration whatsoever, will determine how many bullets I need to protect my family.""

"(CNN) -- At the sentencing of Jared Loughner, Mark Kelly, speaking on behalf of his wife, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, called out politicians for their ""feckless leadership"" when it comes to addressing gun violence in America. ""We have a political class that is afraid to do something as simple as have a meaningful debate about our gun laws and how they are being enforced,"" Kelly said. ""We have representatives who look at gun violence not as a problem to solve, but as the white elephant in the room to ignore."" Giffords was shot at close range in the head by Loughner at a constituency event outside a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011. Her survival and recovery are indeed miraculous, yet after many months of physical therapy, she struggles with her speech and walking. There were 18 other victims in the mass shooting, six of whom died. Despite being rejected by the military because of a history of illicit drug use and being kicked out of a community college for repeated incidents of threatening and bizarre behavior, Loughner legally purchased a semi-automatic pistol with a magazine capable of holding 30 rounds of ammunition. The politicians called out by Kelly and Giffords let the National Rifle Association bully them into thinking that gun owners don't want key flaws in our current gun laws fixed and that you can't win elections without the backing of the NRA. The millions of dollars the NRA spent in unsuccessful attempts to win close Senate races in swing states with high gun ownership rates -- Florida, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin -- suggests that candidates can and do win despite strong NRA opposition. The NRA portrays itself as an organization that speaks for and advocates for gun owners. The reality is that they speak for gun owners with the most extreme views and for the gun industry. A case in point is their opposition to requiring background checks for all firearm sales. Under federal law and most states' law, only individuals who attempt to purchase firearms from licensed gun dealers must present a government-issued ID, sign a form stating that they do not fit any of the firearm prohibition categories and pass a criminal background check. But criminals and gun traffickers are given an easy alternative. They can simply purchase firearms from private sellers who do not require any of these checks. 5 things gun owners want you to know . Closing this absurd loophole would not be political suicide for politicians who fear losing the support of gun owners. A recent survey found that more than 80% of gun owners and 74% of NRA members want this loophole fixed. It seems likely that Giffords and Kelly, both gun owners, would be among this large majority favoring this reform. Gun owners don't want dangerous people to have guns. So it seems doubtful that most gun owners think gun dealers should continue to be offered the special protections that Congress has bestowed on them, which reduce accountability and make it easier for criminals to get guns. When states require background checks for all handgun sales and have strong regulation and oversight of licensed gun dealers, far fewer guns are diverted to criminals. Politicians could also strengthen our gun laws so that, for example, individuals convicted of misdemeanor crimes of violence (often pleaded down from felony charges) or those who have been convicted of multiple alcohol-related crimes are prohibited from possessing firearms. Studies have shown that these groups commit violent crimes at rates many times higher than population averages. Keeping guns from criminals and alcoholics isn't anti-gun -- it's pro-safety. While nonfatal crime rates in the U.S. are comparable to other high-income countries, our homicide rate in the U.S. is seven times higher than that of other high-income countries, due in part to greater availability of handguns. We can reduce the homicide rate by restricting high-risk individuals from owning guns and eliminating legal protections that shady gun sellers and criminals exploit. Science and public opinion are in alignment. It's time for elected officials to listen to the common sense reforms supported by the majority of gun owners and gun violence survivors such as Giffords. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel W. Webster.","At the sentencing of Jared Loughner, issue of gun violence came up .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was left raging after claiming Robin van Persie ""could have been killed"" following an altercation with Swansea's Ashley Williams. Ferguson, whose side moved four points clear at the top of the English Premier League table following Sunday's 1-1 draw, accused Williams of deliberately kicking the ball at the striker's head while he lay on the ground. Van Persie and Williams squared up to each other following the incident as both sets of players tried to break up the confrontation. Blog: Has Ferguson gone too far? Referee Michael Oliver booked both men, but Ferguson wants the Football Association to take action against the Wales defender. ""The Van Persie situation you can clearly see that he could have been killed,"" Ferguson said on Sky Sports News. ""The FA has got to look into it regardless that he has been given a yellow card. ""He should be banned for a long time because that was the most dangerous thing I've seen on a football field for many years. ""It was absolutely deliberate. The whistle has gone, the game has stopped and he has done that right in front of the referee -- he could have killed the lad. ""It was a disgraceful act by the player, he should banned for a long time."" Real Madrid to face Manchester United in European Champions League . Williams was quick to play down the incident after the game. ""I tried to clear the ball it hit him on the head,"" he said. ""I was trying to clear the ball. ""He was obviously a bit angry about that. It was much ado about nothing."" Patrice Evra's 16th-minute header from a Van Persie corner had given United the lead before Michu equalized with his 13th Premier League goal of the season -- which put the Spaniard one clear of Van Persie as the leading scorer. Can revived Torres rescue Chelsea's season for Benitez? Meanwhile, Chelsea went goal crazy by crushing Aston Villa 8-0 at Stamford Bridge to move up into third position. Striker Fernando Torres headed the home side ahead after just three minutes -- his 14th in all competitions this season, and seventh in the league -- before converted midfielder David Luiz curled home an exquisite free-kick. Defender Branislav Ivanovic headed a third before the break as Chelsea ran riot against a team that had been unbeaten for five matches following a poor start to the season. Any thoughts of Rafa Benitez's men easing up after the interval were soon extinguished when veteran midfielder Frank Lampard grabbed a fourth. That strike established him as the club's leading goalscorer in the top flight as he marked his 500th Premier League start with his 130th goal. Benitez takes over Chelsea . Substitute Ramires added another two and both Eden Hazard and Oscar also got on the scoresheet. It could have been worse for Villa, who were indebted to several impressive stops by U.S. keeper Brad Guzan, including a penalty save from Lucas Piazon. ""Everything (impressed me) the performance of the team,"" Benitez said. ""We have been talking before about the mentality of the team; attacking, creating chances we had good movement, we were good in defense. As a team we had the balance we are looking for."" The defeat was Villa's worst in the top flight in its entire history and left manager Paul Lambert's team three points off the relegation zone. ""We were second best. We have to hold our hands hold our hand up, we never turned up at this level we can't play like that,"" Lambert said. ""We always learn, it will certainly be a wake-up call. It's been going fine for us and it is only Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs that have turned us over. We will bounce back."" Meanwhile, Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has signed a new two-year deal with Bundesliga side Schalke. The 29-year-old, whose contract was set to expire at the end of the season, will now remain in Germany until 2015. ""I have thought long and hard over this decision and I am very grateful that the bosses at Schalke gave me this time,"" he said on the club's official website. In France, Marseille moved level on points with Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain and second-placed Lyon following a 1-0 win over Saint Etienne. Andre Ayew scored the only goal of the game to put Marseille third in the table on 38 points but with an inferior goal difference at the halfway stage going into the winter break. Elsewhere, Valenciennes moved up to sixth with a 2-1 win over Evian, while Toulouse earned a 2-0 victory over Sochaux.","Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson believes Robin van Persie ""could have been killed""

"(CNN) -- As Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton steps down from her job Friday, many are assuming she will run for president. And she may. In fact, five of the first eight presidents first served their predecessors as secretary of state. It hasn't happened in more than a century, though that may change should Clinton decide to run. After all, she has been a game changer her entire life. But before we look ahead, I think we should appreciate what she's done as secretary of state; it's a high profile, high pressure job. You have to deal with the routine as if it is critical and with crisis as if it's routine. You have to manage egos, protocols, customs and Congress. You have to be rhetorical and blunt, diplomatic and direct. As secretary of state you are dealing with heads of state and with we the people. And the president of the United States has to trust you -- implicitly. On the road with Hillary Clinton . Of all Clinton's accomplishments -- and I will mention just a few -- this may be the most underappreciated. During the election, pundits were puzzled and amazed not only at how much energy former President Bill Clinton poured into Obama's campaign, but even more at how genuine and close the friendship was. Obama was given a lot of well-deserved credit for reaching out to the Clintons by appointing then-Sen. Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state in the first place. But trust is a two-way street and has to be earned. We should not underestimate or forget how much Clinton did and how hard she worked. She deserved that trust, as she deserved to be in the war room when Osama bin Laden was killed. By the way, is there any other leader in the last 50 years whom we routinely refer to by a first name, and do so more out of respect than familiarity? The last person I can think of was Ike -- the elder family member who we revere with affection. Hillary is Hillary. It's not surprising that we feel we know her. She has been part of our public life for more than 20 years. She's been a model of dignity, diplomacy, empathy and toughness. She also has done something no other secretary of state has done -- including the two women who preceded her in the Cabinet post. Rothkopf: President Hillary Clinton? If she wants it . Hillary has transformed our understanding -- no, our definition -- of foreign affairs. Diplomacy is no longer just the skill of managing relations with other countries. The big issues -- war and peace, terror, economic stability, etc. -- remain, and she has handled them with firmness and authority, with poise and confidence, and with good will, when appropriate. But it is not the praise of diplomats or dictators that will be her legacy. She dealt with plenipotentiaries, but her focus was on people. Foreign affairs isn't just about treaties, she taught us, it's about the suffering and aspirations of those affected by the treaties, made or unmade. Most of all, diplomacy should refocus attention on the powerless. Of course, Hillary wasn't the first secretary of state to advocate for human rights or use the post to raise awareness of abuses or negotiate humanitarian relief or pressure oppressors. But she was the first to focus on empowerment, particularly of women and girls. She created the first Office of Global Women's Issues. That office fought to highlight the plight of women around the world. Rape of women has been a weapon of war for centuries. Though civilized countries condemn it, the fight against it has in a sense only really begun. Ghitis: Hillary Clinton's global legacy on gay rights . The office has worked to hold governments accountable for the systematic oppression of girls and women and fought for their education in emerging countries. As Hillary said when the office was established: ""When the Security Council passed Resolution 1325, we tried to make a very clear statement, that women are still largely shut out of the negotiations that seek to end conflicts, even though women and children are the primary victims of 21st century conflict."" Hillary also included the United States in the Trafficking in Person report. Human Trafficking, a form of modern, mainly sexual, slavery, victimizes mostly women and girls. The annual report reviews the state of global efforts to eliminate the practice. ""We believe it is important to keep the spotlight on ourselves,"" she said. ""Human trafficking is not someone else's problem. Involuntary servitude is not something we can ignore or hope doesn't exist in our own communities."" She also created the office of Global Partnerships. And there is much more. She has held her own in palaces and held the hands of hungry children in mud-hut villages, pursuing an agenda that empowers women, children, the poor and helpless. We shouldn't have been surprised. Her book ""It Takes a Village"" focused on the impact that those outside the family have, for better or worse, on a child's well-being. As secretary of state, she did all she could to make sure our impact as a nation would be for the better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Clinton stepping down as Secretary of State. Maybe she'll run for president .

"(CNN) -- Ai Weiwei's official probation period may have ended, but the internationally-renowned artist and political dissident is pessimistic about his pending tax evasion case and the rule of law in China. ""I feel very sad, very miserable, actually,"" he said in an interview Friday with CNN at his studio in Beijing. Despite the relative freedom of having his travel ban reduced to leaving the country instead of the Chinese capital, Ai was not ready to celebrate. ""You always feel vulnerable and you are not protected by law,"" he said, adding that he has ""no illusion ... any sort of change could be made."" Ai, 54, was denied access on Wednesday to the first court hearing in his tax evasion case, which he contends is baseless and politically-motivated. He said more than forty police cars and hundreds of officers surrounded his home. ""You just cannot go, if you try, you cannot make it,"" he claimed the police told him. Public buses were also prevented from stopping in the area of the court,"" he added. ""They use the tax case to crush me but they don't want me to show up because...all facts can be revealed."" Ai likened the court proceedings to a ""very bad play"" and said he was feeling ""very discouraged"" and ""powerless."" ""The outcome is very clear. The court works for the police; the tax bureau also works for the police; the police is becoming a superpower in China...And they decide everything because we have a policy: it's called 'maintain stability'...But what is stability?

He was released on probation the following June and subjected to severe restrictions on his movements. Ai was forbidden to speak to the media or post on his Twitter account about his detainment. His phone was tapped, his e-mails were checked, and he had to report his appointments with other people to the police. ""I'm always followed by two or three cars and have police around,"" he said.

"(EW.com) -- The biggest production on TV of one of the biggest stories in fantasy is about to get a little, well, bigger. The ""Game of Thrones"" team is creating a ""super-sized"" third season of the hit series. With showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss tackling content from the first half (roughly) of author George R.R. Martin's largest ""Song of Ice and Fire"" novel (the 973-page fan-favorite ""A Storm of Swords""), the writer-producer duo are delivering slightly longer episodes to the network. There's still 10, but you'll get a little more each week than previous seasons. EW.com: 'Game of Thrones' casts 'Rome' actor as Mance Rayder . ""There's almost another full episode's worth of extra minutes spread across the season,"" Weiss says. ""One of the great liberties with HBO is we're not forced to come in at a specific time. We can't be under 50 minutes or over 60, but that gives us a lot of flexibility."" It will be ""a super-sized season, as befitting 'Storm of Swords,'"" Benioff adds. ""Last year we had a lot of 52-minute episodes. This year is a lot of 56, 57."" In fact, the third season finale is expected to run more than an hour â€” a move that requires special permission from the network (previously, the show's pilot and its second season finale exceeded an hour). Episodes are still being calibrated so exact times could change, but HBO and producers are confident the season will deliver more ""Thrones"" than ever before. EW.com: 'Game of Thrones' season 3 teaser poster released . HBO says in a statement: ""All 10 episodes gained a minute or two from past seasons with the finale very possibly exceeding 60 minutes.""

"(CNN) -- Once called the ""mad dog of the Middle East,"" Libya's often flamboyantly dressed ruler, Moammar Gadhafi, has ruled the north African nation for 42 years. But Libya's 679,362 square miles and 6.4 million people have rarely seemed enough for Gadhafi, who in 2008 gathered a group of African tribal leaders and had them grant him the lofty title, ""King of Kings."" It was part of his campaign for a unified Africa -- a single federation with a million-man army at its disposal -- a nation that he, naturally, would serve as president, said Ronald Bruce St. John, the author of seven books on Libya. ""The Libyan stage is not enough of a playhouse for Gadhafi. It never has been,"" St. John said. Gadhafi's ""King of Kings"" ploy was only another in a string of efforts by the mercurial leader to secure a larger-than-life place for himself on the world stage, efforts that have frequently landed him and his citizens in the harsh glare of an angry international community, according to St. John. Gadhafi's growing anger over the rejection of Arab and African leaders and his own growing anti-Western sentiment led him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, said Dirk J. Vandewalle, a Libya expert at Darmouth University. It led to the infamous bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people died. ""Terrorism was a cheap way to get even with the West,"" Vandewalle said. Gadhafi, who will turn 69 in March, seized control of Libya in the very place where the current tumult seems strongest, the city of Benghazi. As an Army captain, he led a bloodless coup against King Idris on September 1, 1969, establishing the Libyan Arab Republic in just two hours, according to GlobalSecurity.org, an independent provider of security information. He established a putative system of direct democracy called Jamahiriya that supposedly allowed the nation's citizens direct input into their government, St. John said. In reality, the country was sliding into a dictatorship led by Gadhafi, he said. In taking control of the country, he became one of a number of young revolutionaries in the region carrying a strong message of Arab nationalism in the mold of Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser, Vandewalle said. Although U.S. leaders initially tried working with Gadhafi, it quickly became clear he was an Arab nationalist and relations with the West quickly deteriorated, St. John said. By 1972, he was urging Muslims to fight Western powers, including the United States and Great Britain, and backing black militants in the United States as he pursued a leadership position in the Arab world, seeking to succeed his political idol, Nasser, who had died in 1972. But Arab leaders shunned his responses, Vandewalle said, seeing him more as a ""buffoon"" and a ""clown"" than a potential pan-Arab leader. That rejection, his own growing anti-Western sentiment and a lack of criticism within the tightly controlled Libyan political environment led Gadhafi to turn to terrorism, Vandewalle said. ""I think it was frustration more than anything else,"" he said. In 1986, Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that left one American service member dead, prompting U.S. President Ronald Reagan to dub the Libyan leader the ""mad dog of the Middle East."" The United States bombed targets in Libya in response and imposed economic sanctions. Two years later, Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. In 1999, seeking rapprochement with the West, Gadhafi succumbed to Western demands to turn over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. The moves helped the country regain diplomatic relations with the United States in 2006, but that wasn't the end of Gadhafi's touchy relations with foreign nations. In 2008, Swiss officials jailed one of Gadhafi's sons, prompting the furious leader to cut off the country's oil supplies, withdraw the country's money from Swiss banks and threaten to cut off diplomatic relations. And in 2009, Libya and Gadhafi again became the subject of international ire in 2009 when the government granted a hero's welcome to Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, who had been convicted in the Lockerbie bombing but was released by Scottish authorities for health reasons. While his politics have brought the attention of international leaders, it may be Gadhafi's personal style that has brought him the most awareness around the world. Gadhafi is known for appearing in public in outrageous, sometimes outlandish, garb, St. John said. Images of the Libyan leaders available on the Internet show him dressed in everything from lavishly decorated military uniforms to animal prints. Gadhafi famously travels with a traditional Bedouin tent, whose appearance in 2009 frustrated officials in Bedford, New York, when he came to New York to address the United Nations. He also travels with a retinue of female bodyguards, St. John noted. While Gadhafi has a substantial number of enemies within Libya, his use of the county's enormous oil revenues to provide subsidized health care, education and housing to citizens, as well as his willingness to stand up to the West, granted him a reserve of good will that he still draws on today, said Vandewalle. ""This was a young nationalist who stood up to the West, who nationalized the oil companies, who stood up to Great Britain and the United States,"" Vandewalle said. ""It was highly symbolic and there are a number of people there who still grudgingly respect him for that."" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report .","Moammar Gadhafi has ruled Libya for 42 years .

"Coleraine, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Two members of Jordan's paralympic team who use wheelchairs and a trainer accused of sexual assault won't be competing in the London 2012 Paralympic Games. The three members of the Jordanian team were arrested after two girls and two women in Northern Ireland filed complaints alleging sexual assault by the men, police said. The three have been released on bail in Northern Ireland after an embassy official promised they would be returned to face sexual assault charges. The two athletes and the trainer, meanwhile, were withdrawn from competition and have returned to Jordan, according to a statement released by the International Paralympic Committee. The Jordanian Paralympic Committee's president and board said it ""would be inappropriate"" for the athletes to compete in the games, which begin next week. ""We have a zero tolerance on any misconduct and will continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland authorities to assist in their investigation. However, our focus is now preparing the remaining members of the team for competition, and we look forward to taking part in what promises to be a truly magnificent sporting event."" The men, who were training at a sports complex in Antrim, 35 kilometers (22 miles) northwest of Belfast, are accused of assaulting the women and girls over a four-day period, beginning on August 16, police said. The men have denied the charges. Powerlifter Omar Sami Qaradhi, 31, has been charged with two counts of sexual activity with a child, one count of sexual assault against a woman and one count of voyeurism, according to charges read during a hearing in Coleraine, County Londonderry. Powerlifter Motaz al-Juneidi, 45, was charged with sexual assault against a woman. Trainer Faisal Hammash, 35, was charged with two counts of causing a child to engage in sexual activity. A Jordanian embassy official said during the hearing that King Abdullah had been inquiring about the matter. She promised the men would return to Northern Ireland for future court appearances. A senior Jordanian government official denied reports that the King had personally intervened in the case, although the official said the monarch was ""concerned"" by the allegations.","NEW: Jordan's Paralympic Committee says it has ""zero tolerance on any misconduct""

"London (CNN) -- A bobsled guided by mind power, guns fired by blowing into a headset, desert waves created by nanobots -- the world of disabled athletes could be very different in the near future. A new exhibition of prototypes aimed at making sport more accessible has opened in the British capital, featuring innovative ideas from young designers. Taking this year's London Paralympic games as their inspiration, students from Imperial College, London and the Royal College of Art have come up with 11 ingenious ideas that dream up new equipment and, in some cases, entirely new sports. The goal was to create a much more even playing field for athletes of different levels of ability, says David Keech, a tutor on the Innovation Design Engineering postgraduate course . ""When we started the project we said to the students: 'It can't be Marvel (comics), it can't be Quidditch (a game in the Harry Potter films), but it has to have something of that in there.' It's all about imagination, and for the students here, that is their currency,"" Keech, a course tutor at Imperial College, told CNN. ""Headshot"" -- a new take on clay-pigeon shooting for both the able-bodied and disabled -- is a good example. Competitors don a special headset which translates head movements (up, down and side to side) into movements on a powered platform below. Firing the gun is activated by blowing into a sensor on the headset. ""It maintains the physicality of the sport and the man/machine connection,"" says co-designer Jeff Gough. ""There is a strong sense of thrill as the gun is mounted on the body. We played with a few different ideas but we wanted to mimic the fine motor skills involved in shooting."" Another prototype, ""Brainsled,"" utilizes existing gaming headgear to let athletes steer a bobsled by the power of thought, allowing able-bodied and disabled athletes to pit their reflexes and powers of concentration against each other. The challenge has been sponsored by Rio Tinto (provider of the metal for medals at London Olympics and Paralympics) which awarded a Â£5,000 ($8,000) development prize to the most promising design. That honor went to ""Ghost,"" a haptic device mounted on the wrist and elbow which uses sounds and vibrations to tell the wearer when they are performing a particular motion correctly. The students imagine it helping to hone a swimming stroke, and Keech thinks it has ""wonderful possibilities."" Iain Dawson, a visually-impaired parathlete who advised the students on the four-week project, was impressed with their efforts. ""It's not an easy thing to make work in such a short space of time, but it has a wide application and it's exactly what we talked about,"" he said. Dawson, a former world and European paratriathlon champion who suffers from X-rated retinoschisis, also praised ""Rainbow Touch"" -- an idea which uses panels of color and textures on sports clothing to help visually-impaired athletes identify teammates. Other stars of disabled sports were also on hand during the task including British Paralympians Tanni Grey-Thompson (winner of 11 gold medals) and javelin thrower Scott Moorhouse, who helped out with a new adjustable knee socket for a prosthetic leg. ""It was really a meeting of minds,"" Keech said. ""The best design students in the world meeting the best athletes in the world."" Other designs peered a little further into the future. ""Mind Surfer"" imagines waves created by ""self-replicating nanobots"" and ""Sky Ball"" imagines athletes wearing prosthetic wings, while ""Cannonball"" is the name given to ""a fast and furious wheelchair team sport.""","New design exhibition imagines new sports for future Paralympics .

"Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- James Holmes sat in the interrogation room in his T-shirt, white socks and boxers. Gone was the body armor that police found him wearing when they encountered him outside a movie theater where scores of people had been shot. Police had cut it off. Craig Appel -- the lead detective in the investigation into the 12 killings at the Century Aurora 16 Multiplex Theater in Aurora, Colorado -- testified Tuesday that paper bags had been placed over Holmes' hands to potentially preserve evidence. As Holmes was being interviewed, he used the paper bags as puppets. He played with his polystyrene drinking cup as if it were a piece in a game, Appel said. He removed a staple from the table and tried to stick it in an electrical outlet, the detective testified. Asked by a defense attorney whether he had ordered a blood test for Holmes, Appel said he had not. ""There were no indications that he was under the influence of anything,"" he said. Appel testified that investigators found 76 shell casings at the auditorium where Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 more on July 20, at a midnight movie showing. Most of the spent rounds -- 65 -- were .223 caliber, while six were shotgun shells and five were .40 caliber. Aurora police Sgt. Matthew Fyles testified the .223 cartridges were steel-core rounds, which are more likely to pass through a body intact and can cause multiple wounds. The details came on the second day of Holmes' preliminary hearing, which could last all week. It is meant to prove to Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester that prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed to trial. Attorneys for Holmes, a 25-year-old former neuroscience graduate student at a nearby university, are expected to seek a ""diminished capacity"" defense that could prevent the case from getting that far. Some of their questions during cross-examination have also suggested they are trying to make it appear Holmes might have been under the influence of something the night be was arrested. The term ""diminished capacity,"" according to the Colorado Bar Association, relates to a person's ability or inability ""to make adequately considered decisions"" regarding his or her legal representation because of ""mental impairment or for some other reason."" The day wrapped up with Fyles, who detailed what happened to each of the victims, including a dozen people who were injured as people tried to flee. Fyles will testify again Wednesday morning as the last prosecution witness. The defense is allowed to call two witnesses. Chilling 911 calls played . Also Tuesday, prosecutors played the first 911 calls from the movie theater shooting as they continued building their case at a preliminary hearing. The recording was loud, chaotic and difficult to understand. There was too much sound to make out what the caller was saying. Just one thing is unmistakable: the sound of gunshots. At least 30 of them. In 27 seconds. Detective Randy Hansen testified that the first call to authorities came 18 minutes after the film started. More trickled in until the torrent was complete: 41 calls in all, he said. Because the movie was still playing and, in at least one, the gunman was still stalking the theater, the calls are difficult to make out. In one, a 13-year-old girl called to say her cousins had been shot. A 911 operator tried to lead the sobbing girl through performing CPR on one who was still breathing. Family members of victims attending the hearing held each other and choked back tears as the calls were played. Police describe elaborate setup in apartment . After detailing the calls, prosecutors turned to the intricate explosive web authorities say Holmes left in his apartment, including jars of homemade napalm with bullets suspended inside and topped with thermite, a material that burns so hot it is nearly impossible to put out. In photos displayed in court, the mixture looked like amber-colored gelatin. Elsewhere in the sparsely decorated apartment, a container of glycerin hung connected to a tripwire, ready to tip into a frying pan that held a homemade substance that would have sent sparks flying onto carpets soaked in oil and gas, setting them aflame, FBI bomb technician Garrett Gumbinner testified. A robot sent inside discovered the tripwire. He said Holmes also told him that he had left a boombox by a trash container outside his apartment rigged to start playing loud music 40 minutes after he turned it on. Next to it, Holmes said, he left a remote-control toy car and a control device that would set off the explosives inside his apartment, Gumbinner testified. Appel said someone took the boombox into an apartment where police recovered it and found Holmes' prints on it. They never located the toy car, he said. Also, Steve Beggs, a supervisory agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified that Holmes had purchased 6,295 rounds of ammunition and four firearms beginning in May. Ten weeks before the attack, on May 10, he bought two canisters of tear gas over the Internet, Beggs said. He was still buying materials into July, Beggs said, testifying that authorities have video of Holmes buying an accessory at a Colorado gun store on July 1. In the video, he said, Holmes' hair is bright orange. Court room packed with family, spectators . In Monday's first day of testimony, police officers recounted arriving at the movie theater to find a detached, sweaty Holmes outside and a horrific scene inside the theater, where the floor had become slippery with blood and cell phones rang unanswered. Aurora survivors: How they're doing . Holmes was a doctoral student in Aurora, in the neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus of the University of Colorado, Denver, until he withdrew a month before being arrested outside the bullet-riddled movie theater. He had been a patient of a University of Colorado psychiatrist, according to a court document filed by his lawyers. Holmes did not speak during Monday's hearing. His bushy hair and long beard contrasted with the bright red hair and close-cropped facial hair he sported during previous appearances. During portions of the hearing, family members of victims held one another, sobbing. Security was tight. Spectators had to pass through a metal detector and then were searched again before entering the courtroom. At least nine armed officers stood guard inside, some of them scanning the audience packed with reporters and victims' family members. University releases e-mails related to Holmes . CNN's Casey Wian and Jim Spellman reported from Colorado; Michael Pearson wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Michael Cary and Greg Botelho also contributed to this report.","NEW: Shooter used steel-core rounds in attack, police officer says .

"Placerville, California (CNN) -- A man accused of kidnapping then-11-year-old Jaycee Dugard and holding her captive for nearly two decades is competent to stand trial, a California judge ruled Thursday. The decision clears the way for the trial of Phillip Garrido on charges of kidnapping, rape and false imprisonment to begin late this year, El Dorado County Superior Court Judge Douglas Phimister said. Garrido's lawyers reached an agreement with prosecutors before Thursday's hearing and the defense waived the right to a jury trial on the issue of Garrido's competency. Dugard was snatched from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California in 1991. Garrido and his wife, Nancy, are accused of holding Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years. Dugard was 29 when she was found in August 2009 at the Garridos' home in Antioch, about 120 miles from her house. Nancy Garrido pleaded not guilty late last year to charges in connection with the case, and proceedings against her husband were suspended until a determination about his competency could be made. The next court date in the case is February 28, when Phillip Garrido will be arraigned on the indictment returned by a grand jury last year. The arraignment had been delayed until the competency issue could be decided. Nancy Garrido's case is set for a hearing on the same day, February 28. She has already been arraigned on the indictment against her. In Session's Beth Karas contributed to this report.","The competency ruling clears the way for Garrido's arraignment .

"(CNN) -- January can be a grueling month. Christmas is but a distant memory, with the only reminder of the festive period the credit card bills which keep tumbling through the letter box. It is often a time for cutting ones cloth as once profligate football clubs are finding out, though the likes of English Premier League club Queen Park Rangers have gone on a spending spree in a desperate bid to avoid relegation. English Premier League clubs splashed out a combined £120 million ($190 million) on new players during the January transfer window -- double the £60m spent during the same period in 2012 -- but those figures can be deceptive, with QPR, Liverpool and Newcastle United accounting for over half of the money spent in England's top flight. But, in truth, the increase in spending contradicts the mood of austerity which is blowing like tumbleweed through European soccer. ""There were relatively few active spenders in the winter window, with over half of this January's total transfer spending coming from three clubs,"" said Dan Jones, partner in the sports business group at Deloitte, as he analyzed spending trends in the English Premier League. ""Winter window activity tends to be driven by the on-pitch competition at the upper and lower ends of the Premier League table."" The elephant in every club boardroom is the need to factor in European governing body UEFA's new financial rules that are designed to prevent big spending clubs spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses. ""Clubs are now in a reporting period that will count towards the first assessment of UEFA's financial fair play break-even requirement for international competition and Premier League clubs are also considering the implementation of additional cost control regulation at a domestic level,"" added Jones. ""Their apparent relative restraint in this transfer window may reflect an increasing focus on clubs achieving more sustainable levels of expenditure relative to revenues."" Like QPR, the motivation for Newcastle, currently 15th in the table, to bring in reinforcements was to ensure Premier League survival. And the arrival of the cavalry at both clubs is already starting to have an effect. France striker Loic Remy scored on his debut for QPR in a 1-1 draw with West Ham United, while Newcastle's new French midfielder Moussa Sissoko dominated the game during Tuesday's 2-0 win at relegation rivals Aston Villa, who preferred a strategy of financial prudence, which may yet backfire. Premier League survival is more important than ever this term, with a record-breaking television deal set to offer clubs and unprecedented bounty next season. ""Premier League clubs have been relatively restrained in their player transfer fee spending, in spite of the upcoming uplift in their broadcasting revenues of between £20m and £30m each from next season,"" added Jones. ""Whilst the clubs' total spending was £120m, after taking into account transfer income, the Premier League clubs' net transfer spend was £70m."" The transfer window system has been in place across European since 2003. In 11 January windows, English clubs have traditionally outspent their continental rivals, and the trend continued in 2013. The second highest spending league this January was Italy's Serie A, which spent roughly 70% of the EPL's total. The most high-profile of those transfers was that of controversial striker Mario Balotelli, who joined AC Milan from English champions Manchester City. Spending in France and Germany was dwarfed by that in England and Italy. The total amount spent in both countries was between 30 and 45% of that recorded in England, with an exodus of players across the English Channel the trend during France's transfer window. One Englishman who bucked the trend was soccer icon David Beckham, who joined Paris Saint-Germain on a deal which will see his wages donated to a local childrens' charity.","English clubs topped spend during the January transfer window .

"(CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted a northern California couple accused of holding Jaycee Dugard captive for nearly two decades, authorities said Friday. Phillip and Nancy Garrido face 18 counts, including kidnapping, rape and false imprisonment. They are also accused of possessing child pornography. Both had previously pleaded not guilty to 29 felony counts in the case. Dugard was 11 years old when she was snatched in 1991 from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California. Authorities say the Garridos held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years. She was 29 when she was found in August 2009 at the Garridos' home in Antioch, about 120 miles from her house. Nancy Garrido's lawyers on Friday entered a plea of not guilty on her behalf to the revised charges. Proceedings against her husband have been suspended to determine whether he is mentally competent to stand trial. The indictment, filed September 21 in El Dorado Superior Court, allows the prosecution to circumvent a preliminary hearing, at which Dugard might have testified in open court. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for November 4. The indictment came to light during a scheduled hearing Friday, at which the Garridos were present. They sat just a few chairs apart and showed little emotion as they spoke to their lawyers and listened to the judge. ""There's a number of reasons why we might use a grand jury,"" El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson later told reporters outside the courthouse. ""One obvious reason is that sometimes given the publicity in a case, it's a better way to get the case to a final conclusion and move it along to trial."" Stephen Tapson, Nancy Garrido's attorney, said he did not imagine a trial would start before the end of next year. He also said he believed that Dugard testified before the grand jury. Garrido, a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest, is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. Dugard now lives in seclusion with her mother, Terry Probyn, and Dugard's two daughters. Officials have said Dugard does not want to speak to Garrido or his attorneys, and authorities have tried to keep her location a secret.","NEW: The husband and wife showed little emotion in court .

The woman -- whose name has not been released -- was treated for injuries at Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. The details of her condition are not clear. Authorities charged Hopkins with rape, assault, forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment, arresting him at his Brooklyn apartment on Saturday. He is currently being held on $350,000 bail. The woman claims that she was looking for work in New York and found an advertisement that Hopkins posted on Craigslist, listing a room for rent, according to the complaint. The pair agreed that the woman could stay rent free if she cooked and cleaned for Hopkins, who then paid for her airfare to New York on February 4, 2011. Upon arriving at his apartment, Hopkins allegedly told the woman that she was going to be his slave, the complaint said. The woman claims she was repeatedly raped between February 4 and February 12, and was also tied with a rope, gagged and handcuffed to a radiator, it said. On the ninth day, she said she managed to call her mother and alert her of the alleged abuse. Police found the woman bruised and bound in Hopkins' apartment, according to the district attorney statement. Authorities said the victim was shaking and had marks on her body, according to the complaint. Hopkins is expected to appear in court Friday for a preliminary hearing. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison.","A woman who agreed to cook and clean for free rent allegedly ended up a sex slave .

"(CNN)  -- Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old unemployed college graduate from Tunisia, began a fruit and vegetable stand to earn a living. But he did not have a permit. In December, the local police came after him. ""The police not only confiscated his stand, but they also beat him up,"" said Khadija Cherif of the Federation of Human Rights Leagues, a Paris-based group. In protest, Bouazizi set himself on fire. He died almost three weeks later. His death helped spark a revolution that led to the ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who'd ruled Tunisia for 23 years. Since then, unrest has engulfed North Africa and the Middle East, with protesters taking to the streets in Algeria and Egypt, Jordan and Yemen. From a lack of economic opportunities for vast segments of society to governments that provide little say for citizens, there are many factors behind the current demonstrations. But a significant one is the frustration of a generation of young people in the region struggling to support themselves and their families. The region is now home to more than 100 million young people between the ages of 15 to 29, according to ""Generation in Waiting,"" a book edited by Navtej Dhillon and Tarik Yousef that explores the challenges facing this age group. They are educated. Most countries in the region have high rates of school enrollment at the primary level. And many have high achievement at the secondary level, according to data collected and analyzed by Samantha Constant and Mary Kraetsch of the Middle East Youth Initiative at the Brookings Institution. But the data can be deceptive. ""They're getting the schooling, but it's very poor quality schooling,"" said Ragui Assaad, an expert in the politics and economics of the Middle East and North Africa at the University of Minnesota. He is also affiliated with the Brookings Institution. ""You have tremendous expansion in schooling, more than any other parts of the world in terms of rates of growth of enrollment. But (it is) very low quality schooling that doesn't provide you with any skills that are useful in the labor market.""  Rany Ibrahim, 32, who left Cairo, Egypt, in 2003 to study in Canada, told CNN iReport that the public university system there was ""really bad.""   ""I didn't feel I got the education I deserved,"" he said. ""You get the degree, but you feel like you don't know much."" Ibrahim said the class sizes were large, and there was little personal time with professors.   ""The professors don't have the power to teach freely, (and) the technology is very old,"" Ibrahim said. ""Instead of having a few entrusted qualified graduates, you have many, many graduates but with really poor education."" For previous generations in these countries, there were two job options after schooling: the private sector or the public sector. However, because of the poor quality of education, it's difficult for many of this generation to get a quality job in the private sector, Assaad said. Meanwhile, jobs in the public sector -- essentially those provided by the government -- are shrinking as economies transition from a state-led to market-led mode of development and the number of people grows. ""Employers know a government degree is worth nothing, that they don't really learn much,"" said Ibrahim, the Egyptian expatriate . The oil-rich countries in the Gulf -- Oman or the United Arab Emirates, for example -- are an exception, Assaad said. They can still deliver on the bargain because of oil revenue. Expats of the Arab world: Share your story  Across the region, unemployment rates are about 11 percent, according to ""Generation in Waiting."" Unemployment rates for those between the ages of 15 to 29 are much higher, ranging from 20 to 30 percent in most countries. In Algeria, it is nearly 46 percent and about 45 percent in Iraq. Many wait two to three years to get their first job, the book says. And there is a gender gap, with young women often having the most difficulty finding a job. Many of the region's young people are having difficulties finding housing and are delaying marriage because of the bleak economic prospects, the book says.  ""It was very hard to get a job. I got a couple of jobs, but you have to show connections,"" Ibrahim said. ""My family helped me get jobs, but I always had a hard time to get a job that fit or made me feel fulfilled.""   He eventually won a scholarship and moved to Canada, leaving his family behind, to pursue a graduate degree in information technology. Imagine a generation the size of the baby boomers in the United States trying to find a job in the U.S. economy of the late 1970s or the early 1980s, and you'll have a rough equivalent of what's happening across the region, Assaad said. ""There's going to be a lost generation, in some sense,"" he said. It is a generation whose aspirations and expectations have been stifled, with little outlet for their grievances and frustrations other than to take to the streets.","Experts: More than 100 million young people live in North Africa and the Middle East .
The generation is educated, but the quality of schooling is poor, experts say .
A considerable number of young people in the region are unemployed .
This leaves them with stifled aspirations, little outlet for grievances ."
"(CNN) -- The number of women competing in the Paralympic Games has doubled in the last two decades, according to figures released by the International Paralympic Committee. While at the 1992 Barcelona Games only 700 female athletes were involved in events, London will see a record-breaking 1,513 female paralympians take the stage across 18 sports. Tine Teilman, Chairperson of the IPC Women in Sport Committee which helps to raise the profile and involvement of women in Paralympic Sport, said: ""It is very encouraging that the number of female participants in the Paralympic Games has doubled during the last 20 years. ""I am sure we will see many sportswomen through inspiring and exiting performances become strong role models for others."" CNN has put together a list of eight inspirational women competing in the London 2012 Paralympics. Tatyana McFadden @TatyanaMcFadden . Country: United States . Event: Athletics . McFadden, 23, an eight-time world champion and Paralympics multi-medal winner, . She was born with spina bifida, which left her paralyzed from the waist down. She spent the first six years of her life in a St Petersburg orphanage -- where she walked her hands because she didn't have a wheelchair -- before being adopted a visiting American. At 15, she qualified for the Athens games in wheelchair racing as the youngest member of the track and field team. It was her first international competition and she shocked everyone by winning a silver and a bronze. Four years later in Beijing, she picked up three silvers and a bronze. McFadden races in category T54 events, which are among those for athletes who race or throw from a seated position. Paralympic athletics classifications group competitors into classes that allow them to compete against those with similar impairments. This time she'll be competing in five T54 racing events: 100m, 400m, 800m, 1,500m and the women's marathon. Finally after three Paralympics Games attempts, McFadden won her first gold on day five in London in the 400m T54 race. Sarah Storey @MrsSarahStorey . Country: Great Britain . Event: Cycling . The 33-year-old Briton, who was born without fingers on her left hand after her arm was caught in her umbilical cord in the womb, has already picked up two gold medals in track cycling at these games. Storey began her distinguished Olympic career as a swimmer, picking up two golds, three silvers and a bronze in Barcelona in 1992. She swam at the Paralympics in Atlanta, Sydney and Athens adding 10 more medals to her tally. She switched to cycling in time for the Beijing games, following a serious ear infection in Athens. She could bag two more medals before the games are over in road cycling, but her success has already been immortalized on a postage stamp issued by the UK's Royal Mail. Jessica Long @JessicaLong . Country: United States . Event: Swimming . At just 20 years old, Long is already a veteran paralympian. Long, who was born without any fibulas, ankles or heels and had both legs amputated below the knee at 18 months, began training in her grandparents' pool at the age of 10. She began her professional career aged 12 at the Athens games in 2004. The youngest member of the team, she wowed the crowds by taking home three gold medals. Four years later in Beijing, the gold rush continued: She won four golds, a silver and a bronze. Long is continuing her extraordinary run this games, winning gold in all three events she has so far competed in, with six more to go. Esther Vergeer @EstherVergeer . Country: Netherlands . Event: Wheelchair Tennis . There is little doubt about who the hot seed is in women's wheelchair tennis. World number one, Esther Vergeer, 31, has dominated the sport for the last three games. Not to mention her remarkable streak of 465 unbeaten singles matches, which spans almost a decade. Vergeer developed paraplegia when she was eight years old, following spinal surgery. During rehabilitation, she learned to play wheelchair tennis. In 2000, two years after she made her international debut, Vergeer won a place on the Dutch paralympic team for the Sydney games and went on to win two gold medals. She repeated her impressive accomplishment at Athens in 2004 and in Beijing in 2008, she won gold in the singles event and silver in the doubles. Last year she told Athlete magazine: ""If you don't try, it will never happen."" A motto she appears to have taken to heart. Alexandra Rickham @ARickham . Country: Great Britain . Event: Sailing . Rickham was left paralysed after a diving accident in Jamaica. Ten years later, while studying in London, she tried her hand at sailing and fell in love with the sport. In 2007, she joined forces with fellow GB sailor Niki Birrell and the duo have gone on to win four world titles in a row in the two-person keelboat discipline. They placed a disappointing 5th at the Beijing games and this time round they are determined to bag a medal in the waters off Weymouth. April Holmes @aprilholmes . Country: United States . Event: Athletics . A Beijing gold medal-winner, Holmes has already picked up a bronze in London. Holmes' left leg was amputated below the knee following a train accident, and she mainly competes in T44 sprint events, for athletes who have an impairment that affects their arms or legs. Now 39, Holmes won a bronze medal in the long jump in Athens and winning her Beijing gold in the T44 100 meters race. She will be hoping for a gold in the T44 200 meters, after all, she once said: ""Someone has to be great. Why not me?"" Sarai Gascon @saraigascon . Country: Spain . Event: Swimming . The Spanish 19-year-old is a hot contender to take the place of celebrated South African paralympic swimmer, Natalie du Toit -- who will retire following London 2012. Gascon was born without a left hand or forearm, but took delight in getting in the water from the age of three. By nine, she had started competing internationally and took silver at the Beijing Paralympics when she was 15 years old. Last year at the European Championships, she won seven medals, but du Toit was not competing at the event and has already taken a gold from Gascon at these games -- in the Women's 100m Butterfly S9 class, for swimmers with physical impairments. A recent tweet from Gascon shows the elation a paralympian feels after winning a medal. She writes: ""So happy! Silver medal with European record! :D Very happy for my ""xico?"" @josemari88 for 4th place medal!!"" Gascon will have plenty more opportunities to take gold -- she's competing in six more races. Jessica Gallagher @JessGallagher86 . Country: Australia . Event: Long Jump, Javelin Throw . An impressive sporting all-rounder, Jess Gallagher set herself some even more impressive goals for London 2012. She is the first and only Australian woman to win a medal After winning Australia's first Paralympic Winter Games gold medal in 2010 in Vancouver, where she won the vision-impaired slalom, she is aiming to be the first Australian to win medals in both the Paralympic Summer and Winter Games. Gallagher, who was told at 17 that she was losing her sight, has so far come 6th in the javelin and so will setting her sights firmly on success in the long jump.

"New York (CNN) -- A woman suspected of snatching an infant from a New York hospital in 1987 has been indicted on federal kidnapping charges, according to court papers released Thursday. Ann Pettway was charged with one count of kidnapping in the abduction of Carlina Renae White, now 23, who was reunited with her biological mother in January. According to court documents filed in the case last month, Pettway admitted to taking the girl from a Harlem hospital after suffering several miscarriages. The grand jury said Pettway ""willfully and knowingly"" seized the baby, according to a copy of the indictment from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Pettway turned herself in last month at the FBI office in Bridgeport, Connecticut, FBI spokesman William Reiner said. She faces up to 20 years to life in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 if convicted. White tracked down her birth family in early January, saying she had had a nagging feeling all her life that she was brought up by a family to which she didn't belong. Ernie Allen, president and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said White's suspicions grew after the woman who raised her could not produce a birth certificate for her. White's mother, Joy White, told the New York Post last month that she last saw her daughter when she was 19 days old. She took her to a Harlem hospital on August 4, 1987, because the baby had a high fever, a New York police official said. Carlina was admitted to the hospital, and her mother went home to rest. When she returned, the baby was gone. ""That was a big part of my heart that was just ripped apart,"" Carlina White's biological father, Carl Tyson, told the Post regarding her disappearance. Pettway is scheduled for a hearing on February 24.","The grand jury said the defendant ""willfully and knowingly"" seized the baby .

"(CNN) -- There were blood relatives in Houston who wanted to adopt. There was a guardian ad litem volunteer who had concerns about the adoptive parents. Child investigators were called on more than one occasion to the home. Yet early Monday along a Florida interstate, a road ranger pulled up behind a parked truck only to find an exterminator and his 10-year-old son unconscious, soaked in chemicals, and the boy's twin sister dead. Jorge Barahona -- a 53-year-old father of four children adopted from the state's foster care system -- told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire -- but didn't go through with it. The family had been at the center of multiple complaints to Florida's Department of Children and Families, with callers reporting the twins being locked in bathrooms for long periods of time or bound with tape, according to court testimony. Even so, the children were allowed to remain in the house. This story appears to magnify everything that could go wrong with a child protective system. In 2004, the siblings were placed with a foster family, according to Sonia Ferrer, circuit director of the guardian ad litem program. That family was Jorge and Carmen Barahona, she says. As often is the case when children are in the Florida foster system, a volunteer from the guardian ad litem program was assigned to look out for their best interests. ""The guardian was with the children for four years,"" Ferrer said. ""He had concerns about the placement."" Those concerns were brought to the court's attention and investigated before the children were officially adopted by the Barahonas in 2009, Ferrer said. ""We did everything we could at the time. A full evidentiary hearing."" The judge on the case sided with the experts who found no problem with the children living with the Barahonas. Ferrer recently spoke to that guardian ad litem, who she says is devastated over what happened to the children. He is not the only one. The biological father's sister and her husband wanted to adopt the twins, according to their attorney Steven Grossbard. ""Unfortunately, the expert opinion suggested that there was a significant bond and the courts are inclined to go with experts' opinion,"" Grossbard said. The bond he refers to is the five years the twins lived with the Barahonas as their foster children before being adopted by them in 2009. Over the years problems in the Barahona home were brought to officials' attention. ""Several times we've been out to the home,"" Florida Department of Children and Families spokesman Mark Riordan said. He would not elaborate on the nature of the complaints. The most recent was a call to a child abuse hotline received just days before the twins were found in the truck, according to testimony Wednesday. The testimony came during a Miami placement hearing for the Barahonas' three surviving adopted children. According to testimony by a Department of Children and Families official, the information in the anonymous hotline call came from the 7-year-old daughter of Carmen Barahona's biological daughter. ""When she would go to this home, where these children were being locked in the bathroom, they were being tied, but they were being untied to eat,"" a DCF official testified. The granddaughter was told by her mother and grandmother that she was to keep ""family secrets"" quiet. This information was corroborated when the granddaughter and the two other adopted children were interviewed, according to testimony. All alleged abuses discussed in the hearing were directed toward the twins, not the two other children. Jorge Barahona has been charged with aggravated child abuse, the West Palm Beach Police Department said and will likely face other charges. His wife, Carmen, has not been charged. She tried to hide her face at Wednesday's hearing, where the allegations of abuse were denied by her attorney. The hotline call was on Thursday, according to court testimony. The DCF investigator, Andrea Fleary, said she went to the house on Friday night but Carmen Barahona would not let her speak to the children. Fleary testified that she left the house with the intention of following up on Monday.","Biological aunt wanted to take them in .

"(CNN) -- California authorities extended their condolences Tuesday to the family of Juliani Cardenas, 4, after a body was found that they say matches his physical description. Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson said he believes the remains of Jose Esteban Rodriguez, the man accused of abducting the boy, are also in the canal. A homicide warrant will be issued for Rodriguez, the former boyfriend of the boy's mother, as they continue searching for him, he said. ""We want to offer our deepest condolences to the Cardenas family,"" the sheriff said. ""This is a very difficult time for them."" The clothing on the body matches what the child was wearing when he was abducted two weeks ago, Christianson said. Formal identification of the boy's body will take two to three weeks, he said. Christianson told HLN's Nancy Grace that the family will be able to proceed with funeral plans. The discovery was made near Santa Nella, about 31 miles south of the area being searched for Juliani, who has been missing since he was taken from his grandmother January 18 in Patterson, Stanislaus Deputy Royjindar Singh told CNN. Juliani's mother, Tabitha Cardenas, said last week that Rodriguez -- with whom she broke up about five months ago and who is the father of her unborn child -- would not purposely drive her son into the water. A person who answered at the Cardenas home Tuesday said there would be no comment on the developments. As the family mourned in private, the community held an outside evening prayer service in Patterson. A water authority employee found the body at 7:38 a.m. Tuesday, said Merced County Sheriff's Deputy Tom MacKenzie. ""It's very difficult to find the body of a child,"" Christianson said. ""It's been a very emotional case for everybody."" Authorities on Saturday had called off their lengthy search for Juliani in one part of the 117-mile Delta-Mendota Canal, but said the search would continue elsewhere. Friday night, divers in the canal located the vehicle belonging to Rodriguez, but there was no sign of him or the child. A witness had reported seeing the 2003 silver Toyota Corolla going into the water January 19 with a man and youngster inside, Christianson said last week. ""From the very beginning, we wanted to find little Juliani alive,"" the sheriff said Tuesday. ""Everything led us to that canal."" The car had been trapped in 50 feet of water and was intertwined with two other vehicles, Christianson said Friday. The windows of the car were found opened and it was badly damaged, he said. Cardenas had said Rodriguez either wanted to have her son for himself or wanted revenge for their breakup. She said she never thought he'd harm Juliani. Rodriguez ""wanted to be with my son,"" Cardenas said on January 20. ""He wanted to be with my son so bad that he took it to the extreme."" Cardenas said Rodriguez came to her house early January 18, but she told him to leave because Juliani was asleep and had a cold. The boy's school later called her after Rodriguez had gone there asking to spend time with the boy. Later that afternoon, Cardenas got a call from her frantic mother, who said Rodriguez had again come by and, despite her struggle, had snatched the boy from her arms. Christianson said last week there has been ""no electronic signature of any kind"" from Rodriguez since the boy's abduction, meaning no evidence of cell phone, credit card or debit card use. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report .","NEW: Outside prayer service held in Patterson .

"(CNN) -- The debate over teacher evaluations that's taken center stage in the Chicago schools strike could have major effects on the issue in the future, an education expert says. ""Chicago absolutely matters,"" said Elena Silva, senior associate for public policy engagement at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. ""I think what happens here will substantially matter for what we see happen with teacher evaluations nationwide,"" she said. In the last three years, 21 states have passed have legislation or implemented new regulations designed to highlight teacher accountability, according to a report by Bellwether Education Partners, a consulting firm. The changes came often by way of the kind of standardized testing that one Chicago Teachers Union board member referred to as ""data-driven madness."" My View: A parent's take on the CPS teachers strike . In many -- but not all -- cases, the reforms were hotly contested, with teachers unions saying the changes put jobs at risk without enough evidence they would work in the way both sides say reforms should work -- helping students learn, said Sara Mead, a Bellwether analyst who tracks teacher effectiveness policy nationwide. ""In a lot of places, this has been fairly controversial, but that has not been universal,"" she said. For instance, in New York, teachers unions sued over a 2010 law implementing teacher effectiveness standards in return for funding under President Barack Obama's Race to the Top initiative. But in Colorado, unions and state officials worked together on a law that calls for incentive pay based on performance, according to Mead. Similar issues have arisen elsewhere. In Boston, negotiations on a new contract stalled for a while, in part over differences in teacher evaluations. In 2009, then-Washington schools Superintendent Michelle Rhee ignited a firestorm with a teacher evaluation model that put heavy emphasis on standardized test scores. At the time, the president of the Washington Teachers Union called the evaluation standard a ""flawed instrument with many loopholes."" Many of the state changes were part of what Mead's Bellwether report referred to as an ""unprecedented wave of legislation,"" much of which could be traced back to the $4.25 billion Race to the Top program. The 2009 initiative offers states money under a competitive grant program in return for adopting teacher effectiveness standards and a host of other reforms. It's been an attractive proposition to reform advocates and to many cash-strapped state governors and legislatures -- do something to make teachers more accountable, among other things, and we'll give you more money, Silva said. And unions have moved on the issue of accepting updated evaluation standards, dropping wholesale opposition for nuanced support. Voices of the strike . Last year in Chicago, for instance, delegates to the National Education Association's annual conference approved a new policy statement that calls for ""robust evaluations by highly qualified evaluators using multiple indicators, not a single narrow metric."" But those same unions have hotly contested such changes, arguing that making high-stakes decisions about teaching jobs shouldn't flow from the results of standardized test scores alone. ""Unions don't want teachers being evaluated on student achievement because, the strongest argument or the most common one is, there are too many factors outside control of teachers,"" Silva said. In Boston, where the teachers union has been fighting with city officials over evaluations, union officials wrote on their website that the Race to the Top money ""will dry up shortly, leaving bad policy in its wake. We cannot afford to give up our fight to restore some common sense to what have been mislabeled reforms."" Key issues in the strike . But the drumbeat for change is unlikely to abate, Silva said. ""There is a clear sign that teacher evaluation is changing and will change,"" she said. ""Where it will go and what it will look like is still up for grabs."" Teachers: Why do you teach?","After Race to the Top initiative, fights over teacher responsibility have become more common .
The initiative provides funding to states in exchange for reforms .
The Chicago schools strike could influence the outcome of the debate, expert says ."
"(CNN) -- As the horsemeat scandal continued to spread across the continent, European Union officials scheduled a Wednesday meeting to discuss the issue, an Irish official said Monday. Simon Coveney, Ireland's agriculture minister, called for the informal session in Brussels, Belgium, inviting the EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg and ministers from other European Union nations. Coveney said officials need to take ""whatever steps may be necessary at EU level to comprehensively address this matter."" French officials said Monday they will take measures to ensure that no suspicious products remain for sale. Officials said customers of the food supplier at the center of the uproar, French-based Comigel, will be inventoried. ""We will look (starting Monday) at who their clients are and, as a consequence, we will see what products will have to be taken off the market because there is a reasonable suspicion that these products are composed of horsemeat and not beef,"" said France's junior minister for the social economy, Benoit Hamon. Horsemeat has been discovered in products that are supposed to be 100% beef sold in Sweden, the United Kingdom and France. As many as 16 European nations may be involved in the supply chain, officials say. French officials said that they should know by Wednesday whether fraud or negligence is to blame for the scandal. Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll said regulators weren't at fault. ""This is not a regulation failure,"" he said. ""We have to stop saying that just because there is a fraud. That's like saying that just because there are police officers around and that an accident happens, there is a failure on the part of the police officers."" Tesco, which operates grocery stores in 14 countries worldwide, said Monday it discovered horsemeat in spaghetti bolognese products made by Comigel. Most of the samples showed small amounts of horsemeat, but three contained more than 60%, Tesco said in news release. ""The level of contamination suggests that Comigel was not following the appropriate production process for our Tesco product, and we will not take food from their facility again,"" said Tim Smith, a Tesco executive. Battle over blame after horsemeat found in beef products . Also Monday, Romania denied any responsibility in the scandal. Prime Minister Victor Ponta said the two Romanian slaughterhouses initially suspected to have links to the horsemeat scandal never had direct contact with Comigel and haven't done anything illegal. ""This tendency to throw the responsibility as far away as possible, eventually to the new members (of the European Union), to countries that might have a weaker PR policy, is something that bothers me,"" he said. Minister of Agriculture Daniel Constantin said there is no evidence false horsemeat labeling occurred in Romania. The news conference came in response to food supplier Findus France saying it will file a legal complaint against a Romanian business that is part of the supply chain. It did not name the business publicly, nor did the Romanian officials. Authorities in Europe have said there is no immediate cause for health concerns, but government officials in the UK and Sweden are testing the meat to be sure there is no danger to public health. The blame chain and legal action . Swedish food producer Findus announced Thursday that it had withdrawn its lasagna from stores as a precaution. The products were pulled Monday after Comigel raised concerns about the type of meat that was used, Findus Sweden said. Findus said a letter from Comigel dated February 2 informed Findus that the contamination may date back to August. Horsemeat found in hamburgers in Britain and Ireland . Findus is only one of several companies that receives products from Comigel, headquartered in Metz, France. Others in Sweden and Britain have pulled products from shelves. Six big French retailers said Sunday that they were recalling lasagna and other products. Findus Nordic, which oversees Findus throughout the Nordic region, said it has begun legal action against Comigel and its subsuppliers. ""Comigel is the villain,"" Findus Nordic CEO Jari Latvanen told CNN on Sunday. Comigel has not responded to CNN's requests for comment. The company did not answer its phones when CNN called repeatedly. Neither the company nor CEO Erick Lehagre responded to an e-mail request for comment. But Lehagre told French news agency Agence France-Presse on Sunday that his company had been ""fooled"" by a French supplier. ""We were victims,"" he said, according to AFP. Latvanen credits his company with uncovering ""a serious case of fraud."" ""What has happened with Comigel is a crime, a scandal,"" he said. While Findus has begun legal action in Sweden, the British arm of Findus said it is considering legal action against suppliers as well. Burger King finds horsemeat at European supplier . Tests showed up to 100% horsemeat . One food supplier in Britain, Aldi, said tests on random samples demonstrated that the withdrawn products contained between 30% and 100% horsemeat. Samples of the affected Findus lasagna contained between 60% and 100% horsemeat, according to UK and Irish food safety inspectors. In January, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse DNA, while 23 of them -- or 85% -- tested positive for pig DNA. Of the 10 burger samples, nine were found to have very low levels of horse DNA, the inspectors said. But in one sample from Tesco, Britain's largest retailer, the horsemeat accounted for about 29% of the burger. Tesco apologized and vowed to make sure it never happens again. Irish officials blamed ingredients from Poland. Concerns about a veterinary drug . While horsemeat is not itself a food safety hazard, food inspectors are concerned it may contain the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, or ""bute,"" commonly used to treat horses. Meat from animals treated with phenylbutazone may pose a risk to human health and is not allowed to enter the food chain. Tesco said it tested for the chemical in the tainted spaghetti bolognese products but found no trace. Horse: Coming soon to a meat case near you?

"(CNN) -- Some 220 miles above the Earth's surface, the shuttle Discovery docked Saturday afternoon with the International Space Station for the last time. Due to problems lining up with each other, the shuttle's ""hard-mating"" with the permanent orbiter threatened to push the six-man crew off schedule. The hook-up was finished around 3 p.m., yet NASA's Mission Control noted a possibility that the installation of an express logistics carrier would not be completed until Sunday, one day later than planned. Instead, the crew took a little longer to tackle the job -- getting permission from the space agency's mission control to sleep in an extra 30 minutes in return for the long day's work, according to NASA's Twitter feed. Having been removed from the shuttle's cargo bay and attached to the station's truss, or backbone, the 8,235-pound logistics carrier will be used to stow spare parts, including an extra radiator that was brought up by Discovery's crew. Overall, there were no major problems on the third day of the shuttle's 11-day mission, during which the crew is set to deliver a storage module, a science rig and spare parts to the space station and its six occupants. Hatches to and from the shuttle and space station opened at 4:16 p.m. Saturday, followed by a brief welcome ceremony and safety briefing. Discovery started its 39th and final flight with a launch late Thursday afternoon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Originally scheduled for November, the shuttle's launch had been delayed to make repairs to the external tank's support beams. And NASA halted its countdown on Thursday, at five minutes, because of a computer problem related to safety on the ""eastern range."" But after a confirmation that all was good to go, the countdown resumed, and the shuttle lifted off about three minutes behind its planned 4:50 p.m. ET launch. At least four pieces of foam were seen flying off Discovery about four minutes into the launch. NASA officials said they didn't foresee a problem -- explaining that, at that altitude, the flying foam was unlikely to do any damage to the spacecraft. That said, on Saturday two astronauts shot numerous pictures of the shuttle's thermal protection system, which will be sent down for analysis to make sure there is no significant damage. Astronauts on Sunday will continue moving items brought up on Discovery over to the space station. Final preparations will also be made for a spacewalk Monday, when astronauts Alvin Drew and Steve Bowen will install a power extension cable, move a failed ammonia pump and perform other operations outside the shuttle. On day six of the mission, astronauts will work to attach a permanent module -- known as Leonardo -- to the station. The module will be home for experiments in fluid physics, materials science, biology, biotechnology and other subjects. The Discovery crew is headed by Steve Lindsey. Bowen, a late addition, became the first ever astronaut to fly consecutive missions after he was assigned to take the place of Tim Kopra when Kopra was injured last month in a bicycle accident, according to NASA. Prior to Thursday's launch, Discovery had spent 352 days in orbit, circling the Earth 5,628 times. It has also carried 246 crew members, more than any space vehicle in history. ""In a way, it's ... sad to see the last flight,"" astronaut Steven Swanson said Thursday. ""It's such a wonderful vehicle."" The last scheduled launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour is set for April 19. It will be commanded by Mark Kelly, the husband of U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from being shot last month in Tucson, Arizona. The last ever shuttle mission will be Atlantis, tentatively scheduled to launch during the summer. Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock with a space station of any kind when it met up on June 4, 1998, with Russia's now defunct Mir space station. The craft also was the first to hook up with the International Space Station, doing so on May 29, 1999, according to NASA. Saturday's event marked the 13th such docking for the Discovery.","NEW: Astronauts take extra time to install logistics carrier, then get OK to sleep in .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen opened fire on two U.S. immigration agents in Mexico on Tuesday, killing one and injuring the other, officials said. The two agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were attacked Tuesday afternoon while driving between Mexico City and Monterrey. One of the agents was gravely wounded and died later Tuesday. The other was in stable condition after being shot in the arm and leg, according to a statement released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The shooting took place about 23 miles north of downtown Mexico City at approximately 3 p.m. ET, an ICE official said. The official spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity because the case is still under investigation. The agents, according to the official, were doing ""routine work,"" traveling on a well-traveled highway in an armored car with diplomatic plates. They were forced off the road in Ojo de Aqua and surrounded by a group of more than 10 people. Prior to the shootings the agents apparently identified themselves as diplomats, the official said. The shooting provoked a swift condemnation from the U.S. government. DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano said, ""Let me be clear: Any act of violence against our ICE personnel -- or any DHS personnel -- is an attack against all those who serve our nation and put their lives at risk for our safety. ""The full resources of our department are at the disposal of our Mexican partners in this investigation,"" Napolitano said. ""I am deeply saddened by the news,"" Napolitano said. Senator Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, who chairs the chamber's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, called the shootings ""the latest reminder of the grievous violence south of our border that must be stopped."" One official said the victims, whose identities have not been released, were the first ICE agents to be gunned down in Mexico. According to ICE, the agency has about 30 officers assigned to its office in Mexico City. They work a range of issues including drugs, weapons, currency and immigration. ""ICE is working with the U.S. State Department, Mexican authorities and other U.S. law enforcement partners to investigate the shooting,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with our colleagues."" ICE Director John Morton said the ""tragedy is a stark reminder of the risks cofronted and the sacrifices made by our men and women every day. Mexican officials also released a statement on the shootings. ""Mexico's government vigorously condemns this serious act of violence, and expresses its solidarity with the United States Government and the families of those attacked,"" the statement read. ""Federal authorities, in coordination with state cooperation, have an ongoing investigation to clarify what happened and bring to justice those responsible.""

"(CNN) -- Steven Marx wasn't that mad. And with only 17 Twitter followers, the 48-year-old certainly wasn't popular when he reportedly created the #NBCFail hashtag. But that online conversation would become one of the dominant storylines of the London Olympics, particularly among people who like to mock NBC's sportscasters and in the United States where viewers were upset with the network for delaying its broadcasts of the games to show them in prime time. Marx, a Web designer in Peoria, Illinois, is credited by the blog Mashable with creating that conversation in reference to the London Games. ""Interesting how NBC never mentions you need a cable/satellite subscription w/MSNBC/CNBC to view any coverage online. We're screwed. #NBCFail,"" Marx wrote on his Twitter account on July 26, the day before the Opening Ceremonies in London. He was surprised by the heated and hilarious conversation that followed. ""I don't know to what extent I can take credit,"" he told CNN by phone on Tuesday. ""I don't know how it works, if people saw my hashtag and used it or if other people came up with it on their own and added to it. ""It's kind of fun for me. I've been working in the field of technology for 20 years now and it's finally fun for me to get my 15 minutes of Internet fame."" Welcome to the Twitter Olympics . Marx was on vacation in New Mexico when someone sent him a message on Twitter telling him that bloggers were crediting him with starting the #NBCFail topic. He found it amusing in part because he wasn't all that mad at NBC, just annoyed that he couldn't watch Olympic programming live and online for free. It sounds as though he almost feels bad about playing a small role in unleashing the fury of the Internet on the U.S. broadcast network. ""In some ways it's showing some of the worst sides of what this instant media can do,"" he said, adding: ""It's sort of that mob mentality that Twitter encourages. I think in this sense it's showing the bad. But in the Occupy (Wall Street) movement, it showed the good that Twitter can do for organizing. Even though it's made me slightly famous, I'm not necessarily thrilled with what's happened. I'm not terribly impressed with NBC, but that's not new this year."" Some online writers have said that watching the #NBCFail hashtag has become more fun than watching the actual Olympics. And plenty of others have taken up the torch of teasing NBC, too. A feed called @NBCDelayed posts constant ""breaking"" updates about old news, making fun of the fact that the Olympics are shown on a several-hour delay in the United States. ""BREAKING: Underdog Jamaican bobsleigh team loses control and crashes,"" that feed wrote on Tuesday night in reference to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta.","Steven Marx, 48, is credited with starting the #NBCFail meme .

"London, England (CNN) -- When I think back on this past week and the rollercoaster of emotions I have experienced at the Paralympics, I realize that everything happens for a reason. Hours before the London 2012 opening ceremonies I learned that my appeal to overturn my reclassification had been denied. In that moment I felt defeat. I felt as though everything I had worked for the past four and a half years had been stripped from me, but it was then that I realized that the journey to get to this point wasn't about the medals. The reason why I got back in the water in April 2008 nearly four months after being paralyzed, the reason that I devoted my life to swimming for the past four years, the sacrifices I made, and the person I became, wasn't about the medals. I think it was easy for me to get lost in the numbers -- the number of how many golds I could win -- but when this happened it forced me to reflect on my journey and what got me to this point. I realized I did all of that to become the best possible swimmer, athlete and person I could be for this very moment, medals or no medals. Read more: Follow CNN's live Paralympics blog . I poured my heart, soul, sweat and tears into these past four and a half years to challenge myself, to see just how far I can push my body, to move forward with life, and most importantly because I absolutely love to swim. No matter what happens and what has happened, that is something that can't be taken away from me. That is something that no-one can strip from me. The work that I have put into this, the passion that backs it, and who I have become throughout this journey all remains the same no matter what classification I am. As I went into Sunday's 50 meters freestyle, I knew what I had to do and I knew what I wanted. I had dreamed of that very moment for years and I wanted nothing more than to see our flag raised and hear the national anthem play. Join the conversation on Twitter using the hashtag #cnnparalympics . I went into that race with some stiff competition. Competition I had never raced before. I sat in the ready room as a T10 complete paraplegic, no function from my belly button down, and I was up against girls who are single-arm amputees. I sat there and watched them stretch their legs as I stretched my arms and I knew that it would be an uphill battle, but I also knew that nothing is impossible. As I got out to the blocks, everything from that point on became a blur up until the point when I hit the wall and turned to see my face on the big screen. Read more: Paralympics classification controversy explained . I had done it, I had won my first Paralympic gold medal and I had done it despite my reclassification and everything that had happened.

"(CNN) -- When I was 10, the school that hosted my Cub Scout pack told us we needed to find a new home. The Boy Scouts of America's policy of prohibiting gay Scouts and Scoutmasters -- which the Supreme Court had recently affirmed -- violated the school's nondiscrimination policy. I was confused, because my den mother, Jackie -- who is my actual mother -- was a lesbian, and nobody in our unit had any issue with that. The school district in Iowa City, Iowa, was adamant. We had to go. It would not host an organization that discriminated against gay people. We managed to find an alternative sponsor, a church not too far away. My mother continued to be den mother. But some parents pulled their kids from the pack, uncomfortable with entrusting their sons to an organization they believed engaged in discrimination. Unfortunately, because of the Boy Scouts of America's shortsighted policy, many of the boys who left my pack missed out on learning the lifelong principles, values and skills that Scouting offers. Those enlightened Iowa parents I remember so clearly were one of the reasons that, a decade later, I founded Scouts for Equality, the national campaign to end the Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay members. After meeting den mother Jennifer Tyrrell, a lesbian who had been kicked out of Scouting, it was clear that what I had learned in Scouting demanded action. Opinion: Time for Scouts to ban discrimination . Our organization trained Scouts in grass-roots organizing, led petition drives that gathered 1.4 million signatures, and provided emotional support to advocates as they dealt with character assassination and homophobic vandalism. Less than a month after we launched, the Boy Scouts of America doubled down on its anti-gay membership policy. But last week, in an unexpected move, it announced that its national board is considering a policy change to end the organization's high-profile national ban on gay members and leaders. It would leave the decision to include gays up to local units. Although the move would only shift the ability to discriminate from the national level to the local, it would be an important step in the right direction. There should be no doubt that this move will open the Scouting program to more youth, and that's something we should all be celebrating. First of all, more school districts such as the one I grew up in will be able to resume their sponsorship of Scouting units, offering space for Scouts to meet, develop skills and enjoy one another's friendship. Meeting in local elementary schools always made the most sense for the Boy Scouts anyway: They're in the neighborhood, centrally located and have more than adequate resources to host Scouting programs. Watch Zach Wahls address the Iowa House of Representatives on same-sex marriage . And second, even though some sponsor organizations might continue to bar gay Scouts and leaders and just as we lost Scouts when parents objected to the ban, we may lose some when the ban is lifted. But I believe the overwhelming majority of Scouting units and sponsors will eventually move in the right direction. Opposition to same-sex marriage is very different from opposition to the development of the skills and minds young men need, regardless of their sexual orientation. Finally, when local units are able to set their own membership standards, those organizations that withdrew funding -- most prominently, chapters of the United Way -- will be able to return that funding to Scouting units that embrace inclusion. Without a blanket policy of nondiscrimination, corporate or foundation giving to the Boy Scouts of America at the national level is a veritable landmine. The Boy Scouts of America should move as quickly as its members will allow in implementing a single national policy of nondiscrimination to streamline and assure these funding sources. I have no doubt that some folks truly believe homosexuality is inconsistent with their understanding of morality and we should include their voices in the broader conversation. But those beliefs should not overrule the opinions of others. Nobody is saying that people who are against homosexuality should be excluded. There's still much work to do. Should the Boy Scouts of America's national board adopt the proposed policy change as expected, Scouts for Equality will continue to urge local units across the nation to embrace inclusion. A house divided cannot stand. And speaking as a straight Eagle Scout, discrimination -- whether it's at the national or local level -- sends a harmful message to all young people. It has no place in Scouting. I hope that with the end of this policy, some of those parents who had reservations about the Boy Scouts might re-enroll their sons in the program. Scouting, like the community that once hosted my former pack and may have the chance to do so again, should be a home to all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zach Wahls.","Zach Wahls says his mother, a lesbian, ran his Scout den without any one objecting .

"(CNN) -- Two years ago, the signs were clear. My mother, with Alzheimer's, heart failure, and kidney failure, was not going to live long. My brothers and I took time off work for medical appointments and hospice care. I worried about her comfort, about how my dad would cope and how the grandkids would feel. But I never had to worry about one thing: my job. I knew I could take family leave without being fired. My workplace has generous leave policies. And thanks to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) -- enacted 20 years ago this week -- I had a legal right to job-protected leave. The FMLA has been used more than 100 million times by women and men to care for parents, children and spouses with serious illnesses, to bond with new children and to manage their own serious health conditions. But millions of other workers are not so lucky. The FMLA, which grants job protection for up to three months of leave, applies only to enterprises with 50 or more employees. Eligibility requirements exclude many workers. In other words, close to half of the American workforce has no FMLA protection. Even among eligible workers, many cannot afford to take family or medical leave. This law guarantees only unpaid leave. Only about 12% of the work force has access to paid family leave through employers. As a result, many workers have to choose between a paycheck and their family's well being. Beyond that, work-family policies have not kept up with the dramatic changes that the U.S. work force has experienced over the past few decades, particularly with regard to women. The labor force participation rate for mothers of young children stood at 70.6% in 2011, compared with 47% in 1975. Men, though still doing less family caregiving than women, are taking greater responsibility for it than before. The proportion of men caring for relatives with Alzheimer's or dementia, for example, doubled -- from 19% to 40% -- from 1996 to 2009. As the FMLA turns 20, it is time to bring it up to date for today's work force. This includes expanding coverage and establishing family and medical leave insurance to make leave affordable. Studies from other countries have found that paid family and medical leave programs boost productivity. One study of 19 developed countries found that paid parental leave had a significantly greater positive effect on productivity than unpaid leave. The study also said that instituting paid leave in countries (such as the U.S.) without it could increase productivity. Paid leave helps retain employees and avoid turnover costs. One study found that 94% of leave-takers who received full pay returned to the same employer, compared with 76% of those with no pay. Paid family leave is associated with better health and lower health care costs. A 2010 study found that the United States could prevent nearly 900 infant deaths and save $13 billion per year if 90% of mothers breastfed exclusively for six months. But only 47% of U.S. babies are breastfed at all at 6 months, and only 16 percent exclusively. Paid family leave has been shown to dramatically increase breastfeeding, such as in California, where the introduction of paid family leave doubled the median duration of breastfeeding for new mothers who used it. The bottom line is that paid family and medical leave pays off. It increases productivity, reduces turnover costs, and results in health care savings. The only two states with family leave insurance programs -- California and New Jersey -- are showing positive outcomes, and proving that such insurance programs are affordable. The vast majority of California businesses included in a 2011 survey said that the program had a positive effect or no noticeable effect on productivity, profitability, turnover, and employee morale. Both New Jersey and California finance their programs exclusively through small payroll deductions for workers (with no employer contribution), and offer six weeks of partially paid leave. In New Jersey, workers pay .001% of the taxable wage base (maxing out at $30.90 for 2013), and can get up to $584 per week during leave. The days before my mother's death were peaceful and positive. I had the privilege of being with my family for this graceful end, and peace of mind from knowing my job was secure. Enhancing U.S. law to give all workers this kind of security would benefit not just workers, but businesses and the economy as a whole. The opinions expressed by this commentary are solely those of Janet Walsh .","Family and Medical Leave Act let Janet Walsh keep job while taking time off to care for mom .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected in a series of stabbings and carjackings in New York was charged Sunday night with the murders of four people, authorities said. Maksim Gelman was arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court on four counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of assault, two counts of robbery and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, Brooklyn District Attorney's office spokesman Jonah Bruno said. He will be back in court Monday, at which point he'll have a lawyer appointed for him, according to Bruno. As he was led away from Brooklyn's 61st precinct to an awaiting police cruiser earlier Sunday, Gelman was deluged with questions from gathered media and hostile shouts from the crowd. After uttering an expletive, he said, ""This was a set-up, man."" Authorities said Saturday that Gelman allegedly stabbed three people to death, hit and killed a man with a car, slashed at least five other people and carjacked two vehicles before he was wrestled to the ground early Saturday while attempting to break into the cab of a subway car. Gelman, 23, who is unemployed and known to authorities mostly as a graffiti artist, was arrested about 9 a.m. Saturday, about 28 hours after he allegedly began the spree spanning three New York boroughs, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. ""It's so horrendous and bizarre,"" Kelly told reporters Saturday. ""We have no reason that we can give you as to why he did this."" Police said Gelman got into a dispute with his mother at her Brooklyn home about 5 a.m. Friday after she refused to let him take her 2004 gray Lexus. The suspect's stepfather, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, intervened and was stabbed 11 times. Kuznetsov, 54, died, while Gelman's mother -- who survived unscathed -- alerted authorities. Investigators believe Gelman then took the Lexus, drove about a mile away to the home of his ex-girlfriend and allegedly stabbed her mother, 56-year-old Anna Bulchenko, 11 times, at about 10:30 a.m. Gelman's former girlfriend found her mother dead on the floor when she returned home at about 4:15 p.m., police said. She called police. But in the short period before they arrived, authorities believe Gelman -- who presumably was still in the apartment -- allegedly attacked the former girlfriend, 20-year-old Yelena Bulchenko, with a knife. He chased her into the street and killed her, also slashing the jacket sleeve of a passerby trying to stop him, authorities said. He then left the scene in the Lexus and rear-ended another car, a Pontiac Bonneville, allegedly stabbing its 60-year-old driver in the shoulder and neck in a confrontation and then leaving the scene in that car, police said. Authorities said they later found four kitchen knives in the Lexus. The Pontiac driver was in stable condition as of Saturday, recovering from three stab wounds, Kelly said. About 4:25 p.m., Gelman allegedly struck a pedestrian about two miles away, Kelly said. Steve Tannenbaum, 60, died of his injuries. Police believe the suspect eventually abandoned the Pontiac, which was later found near a Brooklyn railroad line he was known to frequent as a graffiti artist. Shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday, Gelman allegedly got into a cab in Brooklyn and stabbed the driver. As of Saturday, that driver was in stable condition. Kelly said Gelman then got out of the car and confronted a couple, allegedly stabbing a man in the hands and taking his car keys. That man was treated and released at a hospital, Kelly said. The car, a Nissan, was later found in Queens. Shelton Pottinger told reporters he was that victim. ""He looked crazy,"" he said of the suspect. ""He looked like a crazy guy."" He said the suspect pulled a knife and a gun and told him to get out of the car or he would kill him. ""I was shocked,"" he said. ""I didn't know what to do."" But he said he decided to fight, and moved over into the passenger seat. ""I was trying to kick him to get him out."" But he said the man forced his way in and hit the gas. Pottinger said he was holding on to the man's hands as he tried to stab him. Police received a tip Saturday morning that Gelman might have been riding a southbound subway train in Manhattan. A woman approached police at a subway stop and said Gelman knocked a newspaper featuring his picture from her hands and said to her, ""Do you believe what they're writing about me?"" before crossing the tracks and jumping onto a train. The suspect stabbed another passenger -- a 40-year-old man, whom Gelman didn't appear to know -- in the head and neck sometime during his time onboard, Kelly said. That male subway passenger was in stable condition Sunday. Eventually, the suspect worked his way to the front cab of the train. The commissioner said Gelman pounded on the cab's door, yelling ""Police"" -- apparently trying to get in, by claiming he was a police officer. He did not appear to know two transit police officers, later identified as Terrance Howell and Tamara Taylor, were inside the cab with the train's operator. Soon after, the officers -- with aid from off-duty New York police Det. Marcelo Razzo and an unnamed civilian nearby -- wrestled Gelman to the ground. No one was hurt in that scuffle, during which a knife fell to the ground. Police also found Gelman had another, smaller, knife when they detained him. He also had what Kelly described as a ""significant amount of money."" Kelly said the suspect was mostly ""incoherent"" after being arrested, besides a statement that ""she had to die."" The commissioner said he did not know if ""she"" referred to ex-girlfriend Yelena Bulchenko, her mother or someone else. Kelly said Gelman had 10 previous arrests, mostly for drug charges and graffiti, plus one robbery charge. His most recent arrest was January 26, when he was accused of possessing crack cocaine. For roughly the past seven years, Gelman has been a naturalized U.S. citizen. He arrived in this country with his father and mother in 1992 from his native Ukraine.

"(CNN) -- Armed with big grins and risque humor, South African standup comedians Nik Rabinowitz and Tats Nkonzo take to the stage at Cape Town's Baxter Theater. ""We would like to dedicate this song to all the black people in the audience -- I can only see one,"" says Rabinowitz. ""I see three of us tonight,"" quickly adds Nkonzo, with the audience bursting into laughter. Over the next hour, the two South African comedians -- one white, one black -- will deliver their own brand of comedy, using an arsenal of jokes to stir up stigmas and stereotypes in a nation striving to come to terms with its racist past. ""In this country a lot of us do use comedy to confront various things and challenge certain ideas and it is just the tip of the iceberg,"" award-winning Rabinowitz said before the show. ""We do need to poke our fingers in certain places and say, 'well, this is still going on,' and I think particularly around Africa we need to do that -- and we do,"" he added. See also: Master storyteller brings folk tales to life . From race and religion jokes to polygamy gags and political spoofs, Rabinowitz and Nkonzo are using satire to help South Africans accept uncomfortable truths -- and the jokes go a long way. ""I have a polygamy gag where I talk about, I wonder what love songs a polygamist sings to their wives, because there are no love songs that cater to polygamists,"" said Nkonzo, a rising star in South Africa's comedy circuit, who often incorporates music and singing to his performance. ""I had to sit down and go how do I say what I want to say, so then that's how the music thing came and then I go on the whole spiel about they don't have any love songs to sing to their wives and then people laugh -- I win, they win. ""You know this song; you're like a dream come true, just want to be with you, you know it's plain to see, that you're the one for me ... four... five, if ever your work is done, then I'll get another one."" See also: South African ballet dancer confounds racial stereotypes . Having a similar approach to comedy makes Rabinowitz and Nkonzo work well together, but the two artists found their calling in different ways. A much-loved impersonator, Rabinowitz has a loyal fan base from all around South Africa. Besides taking to the stage, he also has a regular slot on local radio with his own political satire show. His comedy career started after he joined a theater company traveling around Africa in his post-university years. Rabinowitz says visiting different countries across Africa helped him enrich his understanding of the continent, as well as pick up different cultural elements that he still uses in his act. ""I spent time in Kenya as well -- they do an interesting thing there where they mix up their 'L's' and their 'R's' in Kenya, so they would say things like, 'we know all about Mr Zuma, your plesident' and we'd say, 'What do you know about him?' 'And they'd say, 'We know he's got a big erection coming up this year,' and we say, 'Yes, that's true,'"" said Rabinowitz, reciting one of the jokes in his act. In his latest show, he shares the stage with up-and-coming Nkonzo, who started his career three years ago after taking part in a reality TV show for comics. See also: Comedy, mystery and post-apartheid fallout: The best of African film . Nkonzo, who often appears on stage with a guitar, said that all of his comedy comes after serious thinking. The challenge, he explains, is to communicate whatever he wants to say but also be funny. ""Comedy is very much hiding hilarity in the humor -- I'm saying what I want to say and you're accepting it and we kind of both win. I feel like I haven't cheated myself, I've told you what I need to say, I've given you your laughs and yet I've left you with something. That's the tension for me."" Rabinowitz and Nkonzo see themselves as the watchdogs of society in South Africa, pointing fingers and exposing the absurdity of the rigid mindset. ""And we have to do it in the light way,"" said Nkonzo. ""If there's an army, that's our post -- there are the president and the law makers and you know, whatevers, we are the comedy wing.""

We are working very closely with Japanese officials on the matter."" McCormack suggested an American delegation soon might meet with the family of the alleged victim or local officials, he said. ""I would expect there would be some senior-level U.S. visitors, not from the U.S. but from inside Japan, who might make a trip down there to Okinawa,"" he said. He wouldn't give any details other than to say such a visit might include the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Thomas Schieffer, and a top U.S. military officer. The episode echoes a similar incident more than a decade ago that strained relations between the United States and Japan.  Watch as the new case strikes a raw nerve in Okinawa » . In 1995, anti-U.S. sentiments boiled over when three American servicemen gang-raped a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl. Two years ago, a U.S. civilian military employee was jailed for nine years for raping two women. ""There have been incidents like this in the past, and it is a problem that it has occurred again,"" Fukuda told a parliamentary panel Tuesday. ""We take this very seriously."" Also Tuesday, the deputy police chief of Okinawa City released more details of the case, saying Hadnott offered to take the girl home on his motorcycle. The schoolgirl, he said, was walking with her friends and accepted Hadnott's offer. According to police, Hadnott took the girl to a house and later to his car. They drove to a park where he allegedly attacked her, police said. The girl used her cell phone to call friends, who notified police. Hadnott reportedly told authorities he only tried to push the girl down and kiss her. The girl disputed his claims, and police said they intend to file rape charges. Under Japanese law, a person can be held up to 10 days without charges. The assault was reported Sunday night in the Chatan entertainment district on Okinawa, a major hub for U.S. forces in the Pacific. Hadnott is based at Camp Courtney there. More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them in Okinawa. They were placed there under a security alliance after Japan was defeated in World War II and forced to renounce its right to a military. The servicemen's presence has at times bred resentment among local residents who have long complained about crime, noise and accidents. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A man who claims he is the father of a baby found in a South Carolina toilet said he doubts the explanations about why the recently arrested mother left the newborn in a commode. Jessica Blackham was arrested and charged in connection with the discovery of her newborn son in the toilet of a South Carolina arena, Greenville Police Chief Terri Wilfong said. In a recent court hearing, Blackham's parents said they did not know that she was pregnant and it was implied that Blackham may not have known that she was pregnant. Blackham told police that she cannot remember what happened after she went into the bathroom at the arena when she was attending a circus. Jason Jones, who said he dated Blackham, told HLN's Nancy Grace that he doubted that story. ""As far as being her not knowing she was pregnant, that's a bunch of bull crap,"" Jones told Grace Wednesday. ""She wrote on her Facebook that she was at one time having morning sickness and a bunch of headaches, and I commented and asked her was she pregnant, and she told me not to worry about it. That she would take care of it."" A custodian discovered the infant, thought then just to be around an hour old, late Friday at Greenville's BI-LO Center. The baby was rushed to the hospital and police searched for the mother for days making public appeals and sifting through videotape taken in and around the restroom. Wilfong said Wednesday that the baby was making progress at the hospital. ""He's doing well. He's in stable condition, and we're very thankful for that. And each day, he's getting better,"" Wilfong said. Blackham was charged with felony child abuse and unlawful neglect, CNN affiliate WYFF reported. She was released on bond after the court hearing, the affiliate reported. No one has been named as the father of the child, but Jones said he has contacted police and wants to take a DNA test.","A newborn baby is in a South Carolina hospital after being left at an arena .

"(CNN) -- While state TV bounced between scenes of serene concert footage and orderly rallies in support of leader Moammar Gadhafi, eyewitnesses describe a far different, far more chaotic Libya -- one with arms-toting mercenaries, demonstrators ramming stolen tanks into a military base and masked men firing guns and blasting pro-government tunes from their sport utility vehicles. Sporadic gunfire continued to ring out early Monday in parts of the North African nation, albeit a far cry from the tumult seen at other times since demonstrations and clashes began Tuesday night in Benghazi. Obtaining independent confirmation on events in Libya is very difficult. The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country. CNN has, however, interviewed numerous witnesses by phone. Several people noted that major unrest came to Gadhafi's doorstep in the capital Tripoli for the first time on Sunday, where crowds of anti-government protesters loudly decried Libya's current government, set fires to cars and braved gunfire by uniformed and self-styled security forces. Gunfire rang out in the capital's streets, some of it coming from the barrel of masked men driving through the streets, said one witness -- who, like many others, isn't identified for safety reasons. A woman said she saw demonstrators running down a Tripoli street outside her window, chased by apparent mercenaries in pickup trucks. The men were firing at the demonstrators and throwing tear gas at them, according to the witness. Many families have closed their windows and turned off their lights out of fear, she said. Demonstrations, clashes and damage were especially evident around Green Square and the presidential palace, individuals on the ground told CNN. According to one person, the heavy guard detail normally positioned outside Gadhafi's residence disappeared Sunday night. Protesters who set fire to cars in the middle of the street soon thereafter bolted after hearing gunfire, a Libyan man said. ""Someone came and said that Gadhafi's people are in the next street,"" he said. ""We could hear the gunshots were very close."" By early Monday, Tripoli's streets had calmed down, though frequent gunshots could still be heard. ""Now we hear gun shots mostly -- a lot of them,"" said one man, adding that he also heard people protesting in the distance. A relative calm had also descended by then in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and a hotbed of anti-Gadhafi sentiment. But it was a far cry from the violence there on Sunday. The central government lost control of Benghazi, with multiple witnesses reporting that protesters took over Libya's second-largest city with support from some military who dropped their allegiance to Gadhafi. However, his son Saif Gadhafi -- in a speech on state television early Monday -- continued to insist the military remained loyal to the ruling government and would be taking an increasingly active role in suppressing unrest in the coming days. The reported power shift followed fresh clashes that left 25 dead earlier in the day, a doctor at Benghazi's Al Jalla Hospital said. A source at Benghazi Medical Center, the city's other major hospital, said there were 10 people dead there Sunday. One man told CNN that uniformed troops opened fire on thousands of mourners as they passed through the streets during a funeral procession honoring those killed the previous day. Protesters later Sunday packed at least one car with explosives and sent it crashing into a compound wall at a military camp in the eastern city, eyewitnesses said. Security forces then fired on the protesters as they attempted to breach the camp. On the camp's southern side, meanwhile, protesters drove a tank from a nearby army base in another attempt to break in, witnesses said. They have also obtained other weapons, the protester said. Libyan state television reported the camp has been defended, and that protesters were being warned on loudspeakers not to attack the compound. The network called it an act of sabotage. The protester said that the military camp is significant because it houses Gadhafi's eastern palace. ""It's a symbol of his dominance here,"" he said. ""And it's the last symbol, basically."" A protester said some fellow anti-government demonstrators had other weapons. Saif Gadhafi accused criminal elements of stealing arms and firing them in an attempt to cast blame on military and security forces. Medical sources and other sources have said that at least 219 had died nationwide in the violence. But Saif Gadhafi said that international media had overstated the death toll. He also claimed foreign nationals and ""illegal immigrants"" had stirred the uprising, with some dissenters attacking government installations as well as stealing caches of weapons. CNN's Brian Walker, Ben Brumfield and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","Witnesses in Tripoli and Benghazi report on tumult; CNN can't confirm their accounts .

"(CNN) -- Before memories begin fading of the funny, feisty, combative former mayor of New York City, America would do well to pause one last time, and remember the greatest achievement of the late Ed Koch: his extraordinary, multi-billion-dollar program of building low-cost, affordable housing. It's easy to lose perspective on the legacy of this larger-than-life character. As host of New York's only nightly political show, I got to sit and talk with Ed Koch every Tuesday night for the last two years, when he appeared on our ""NY1 Wiseguys"" segment, a weekly forum for retired politicians to weigh in on the issues of the day. Koch's final appearance came less than three weeks before he died -- and to the very end, he was a dazzling showman, always ready with a quip, a quarrel or a crusade. All of us will miss him terribly. But we shouldn't miss the main lesson of his mayoralty: Investing in low-cost housing helped families, preserved neighborhoods, and saved a city. And it might be used to do the same for the rest of the country. In 1977, the year Koch was elected mayor, New York had been devastated by waves of arson, abandonment and economic decline, leaving entire neighborhoods strewn with rubble and vacant shells where apartments once stood. A front-page story in the New York Times captured the scene when President Jimmy Carter made a dramatic, unannounced trip to Charlotte Street in the South Bronx to see ""block after block of burned-out and abandoned buildings, rubble-strewn lots and open fire hydrants."" Opinion: Koch, a friend and force to the end . Koch, who was elected a month after Carter's ""sobering"" visit, scrambled to organize a response to the blight but encountered a roadblock a few years later, when the Reagan administration effectively ended federal support for low-income housing, replacing a longstanding program with rent vouchers for the poor. As the federal government got out of the housing business, Koch decided that New York would get in -- and get in big. In 1985, he announced a $4.4 billion plan to create 100,000 units of subsidized housing over a 10-year period, a number that later expanded to 252,000 units that eventually cost $5.1 billion. The plan was audacious. It required massive rezoning of the city and coordination between multiple agencies. More importantly, it deployed New York's capital budget, normally used to pay for sidewalks, roads, bridges and government buildings. Koch put the full faith and credit of the city on the line, borrowing the billions needed for rebuilding and trusting that a general economic recovery would provide the funds to repay bondholders. It was a gutsy move, coming barely a decade after New York's near-bankruptcy. Tweeters loved Koch's 'New York-iness' But the plan was a spectacular success. A veritable army of nonprofit, community-based housing developers worked in partnership with the city to reclaim and rebuild apartments, and neighborhoods like the South Bronx, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem slowly reversed pernicious patterns of decline. Some who had been homeless left the streets and got their lives back on track, while middle-class families moved back in and began paying taxes, raising families and supporting local businesses. Ironically, it was the very neighborhoods Koch saved that provided the votes that speeded his political downfall, with the election of David Dinkins as New York's first black mayor in 1989. But Dinkins and every other mayor since Koch has sworn allegiance to the housing plan, using the capital budget and alliances with community organizations to build and subsidize workforce housing. Eulogists remember Koch . It's surprising that more cities haven't followed Koch's example. Year after year, for decades, New York has produced or rehabilitated 15,000 units of affordable housing. In some years, it has spent more on housing than the next 50 cities combined. Compare modern Harlem or Bed-Stuy to the most troubled sections of cities like Newark, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Detroit, and you see what a difference a massive housing program can make. We'll all miss Ed Koch terribly. It would be a shame to miss a chance to spread his greatest triumph to other cities around the nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","Errol Louis: Building affordable housing in NYC was a Koch feat; other cities should follow .
He says Koch made major investment in housing to raise up families, neighborhoods .
He says Koch did this at a blighted time in NY when fed housing support dried up .
Louis: New York continues to lead in spending on rehabs, new housing, a Koch legacy ."
"(CNN) -- Serbia's Novak Djokovic quickly found his feet on a court he had deemed ""dangerous"" to brush aside Olivier Rochus of Belgium in a Davis Cup tie in Charleroi Friday. It was the world number one's first match since winning the Australian Open last Sunday and his victory has given his country a 2-0 lead as they bid for a quarterfinal place in the World Group. The red clay surface laid in the Spiroudome de Charleroi had been the main talking point in the build up to the tie, with Djokovic, who has had little time to rest since his Melbourne triumph, tweeting: ""Being extra careful here. The conditions are quite dangerous 4 all players. I know organisers did their best, but still.....worried."" In the end, Djokovic's fears proved unfounded as he took just one hour 39 minutes to beat Rochus 6-3 6-2 6-2, returning to Davis Cup action after missing the 2012 edition. His teammate Viktor Troicki had a much tougher task in the opening rubber and he had to come from two sets down to beat David Goffin 1-6 3-6 7-6 6-4 6-4 in thrilling match. Read: Djokovic sets sights on Paris after Australia win . Goffin, who had been unbeaten in his three Davis Cup appearances in singles, served for the match at two sets to the good and 5-4, but allowed Troicki to break back after a series of unforced errors. The Serbian took the set on a tight tiebreak and a single break of service in each of the next two sets was enough to give him victory in just under four hours. Match referee Remy Azemar had ruled the court fit before the start of the two singles rubbers after some last-minute remedial work. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) issued a statement after Djokovic's remarks and complaints from the Serbian captain Bojan Obradovic. ""Under Davis Cup regulations, it is the responsibility of the home nation to ensure a playable court surface is available for each tie. There has been some speculation that laying the temporary clay court surface on wood was a source of the problem,"" it read. ""The ITF would like to thank the Federation Royale Belge de Tennis for their response to our requests and their efforts over the last 24 hours to ensure that the court is fit for play and we look forward to a weekend of exciting Davis Cup tennis."" Holders Czech Republic ended the first day of their rubber with Switzerland in Geneva tied at 1-1. Stanislas Wawrinka, who pushed Djokovic all the way in a five-set epic in Australia, gave the home side the lead with a straight sets win over Lukas Rosol. Wawrinka, leading the Swiss in the absence of Roger Federer, beat Rafael Nadal's conqueror at Wimbledon last year 6-4 6-3 6-4.

"(CNN) -- Switzerland and the Czech Republic broke new ground in Davis Cup tennis on Saturday playing out the longest match in the tournament's history in Geneva. Lasting seven hours and two minutes, the doubles match between Swiss pair Stanislas Wawrinka and Marco Chiudinelli and Tomas Berdych and Lukas Rosol comfortably beat the previous record of six hours 20 minutes set in 1982 when John McEnroe beat Mats Wilander (9-7 6-2 15-17 3-6 8-6) in the tie between the United States and Sweden. The epic match eventually went the Czech pair's way 6-4 5-7 6-4 6-7(5-7) 24-22 to hand them a 2-1 lead heading into Sunday's reverse singles. Wawrinka, who toiled for five hours against Novak Djokovic in Melbourne two weeks ago, tweeted after the match: ""Ice bath done! Now massage and food... Lets be ready for tomorrow!!!!???? ... And congrats to Berdich and Rosol!"" The Swiss no.2 must win the first singles match against Berdych on Sunday to keep the tie alive. The U.S.'s tie with Brazil in Florida is also well poised after the Bryan brothers suffered a shock five-set defeat (6-7 7-6 4-6 6-3 3-6) to Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares on Saturday. John Isner will play Thomaz Bellucci in the first reverse singles match on Sunday. Should he win, the U.S. will play Serbia in the quarterfinals in April. The 2010 champions reached the last eight on Saturday when Viktor Troicki and Nenad Zimonjic defeated Belgian pair Steve Darcis and Ruben Bemelmans in four sets 6-4 6-4 5-7 6-4.

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sarath Fonseka, the former head of the armed forces in Sri Lanka, was released from prison Monday. A military court-martial in 2010 sentenced him to 30 months in jail for irregular procurements during his time in charge of the army. A previous court-martial had stripped him of his title of general and deprived him of his pension for ""dabbling in politics."" Television footage showed Fonseka walking out of prison Monday after Justice Secretary Kamalini de Silva sent paperwork to prison authorities ordering his release. Under the Sri Lankan constitution, the president is empowered to pardon ""any offender convicted of any offense in any court of Sri Lanka."" President Mahinda Rajapaksa had signed an order and placed it with the Justice Ministry before he flew to Doha to attend the Qatar Forum, according to his spokesperson Bandula Jayasekera. ""I can't believe it. This was quite unexpected,"" said Fonseka's wife, Anoma. ""My two daughters have arrived from the U.S. and we are very pleased with the release of my husband and their father."" Fonseka, who led troops to victory over Tamil Tiger rebels exactly three years ago this week, had fallen out of favor with Rajapaksa and his powerful brother, Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. That split came after Fonseka unsuccessfully challenged Rajapaksa in early 2010 presidential elections. Last year, Fonseka was found guilty of ""inciting violence"" for alleging in a newspaper interview that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had ordered the shooting of rebel leaders who were surrendering with white flags during the final stages of the civil war in May 2009. The United States labeled Fonseka a ""political prisoner"" in its annual Human Rights Report last year. Both Washington and the European Union have repeatedly called for his release. The formalities necessary to clear the way for Rajapaksa's pardon were addressed Monday when the Supreme Court allowed an application by Fonseka's counsel to withdraw two different appeals against his previous convictions. Fonseka was driven from the private Nawaloka Hospital to the court by an armed group of prison guards. He had been in hospital for a lung ailment for the past 25 days, according to hospital officials. Large crowds carrying the national flag, portraits of Fonseka gathered outside the hospital. Asked whether her husband would reenter politics, Anoma Fonseka enigmatically replied, ""It depends.""","NEW: Television footage shows Sarath Fonseka walking out of prison .

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal was back in singles action for the first time in seven months Wednesday, making a winning return on the clay courts he has dominated so emphatically in recent years. Having not played a singles match since his shock defeat to Lukas Rosol in the second round of Wimbledon last year due to a left knee injury, a little rustiness was perhaps to be expected. But, after losing the first two games of his match with Argentine Federico Delbonis, the 11-time grand slam champion recovered to record a morale-boosting 6-3 6-2 victory in the second round of the Chile Open in Vina del Mar. ""I'm happy to play a singles match after so long,"" the 26-year-old told the ATP World Tour's website. ""I need days and time to get my game back, but so far the feeling on court is great."" The Spaniard, who has dropped to fifth in the world rankings during his long absence, made his much-anticipated return in a doubles match Tuesday. Nadal partnered up with Argentina's Juan Monaco to beat the Czech pairing of Frantisek Cermak and Lukas Dlouhy. ""For now the most important thing is to spend as much time as possible on court,"" added Nadal. ""This victory allows me to play at least two more matches, singles and doubles. ""To practice is one thing but to play is totally different. In a real match you can't control your body as you do in practice."" Nadal's focus will be firmly on the French Open, the year's second grand slam which begins in May in Paris. The Mallorca native has ruled the Roland Garros event in recent years, winning seven of the last eight events. His hopes of marking his comeback by claiming the title in Chile were boosted by the defeat of World No.15 Monaco. The defending champion and second seed was shocked 7-6 6-4 by the 93rd ranked Guillaume Rufin of France, who recorded just his second career win over a top 20 player.","Rafael Nadal wins on his return to singles action .

"(CNN) -- On the surface, it doesn't make sense. Still hurting from the economic crash, Americans are driving less and buying more fuel-efficient cars. The United States is producing more of its own oil and natural gas than it has in a long time. Yet the price we pay to fill up our gas tanks keeps going higher. It's close to $4 a gallon in many parts of the country and climbing. Should we blame the speculators, those big investors who snap up oil contracts today on a bet that they will be worth more tomorrow? It's easy to work up a lather of outrage about these guys: The same reckless hedge funds and banks that plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s are now prolonging it by greedily inflating the price of the one commodity that we can't live without! But it's not that simple. In fact, probably no fact of our daily economic life is as universally felt and poorly understood as gas prices. That's why we at CNN have decided to devote our latest series of In Depth reports to sorting out what's behind the sticker shock at the pump and how it could become a factor in this year's presidential election. On Tuesday, chief business correspondent Ali Velshi will appear on ""Starting Point With Soledad O'Brien"" and other shows throughout the day to assess the role of speculators. We'll be examining critical questions: . How much does the recent bidding for oil reflect a rational fear that escalating tension over Iran's nuclear ambitions could cause Tehran to block the Strait of Hormuz, choking off access to much of the world's oil supply? How much of it is a cynical wager on bubble psychology? And how much of a difference do speculators really make, once you cut through the fog of easy indignation? On ""The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer,"" our new aviation and regulation reporter Lizzie O'Leary will explain what's actually involved in buying and selling a barrel of oil -- and whether it's a rigged game that only big conglomerates and investors can play. And on her prime-time ""OutFront"" show, Erin Burnett will step back and look at the global market for oil, examining where all the demand is coming from and how a global thirst for oil as far away as China for can affect the price you pay at your station around the corner. On ""CNN Newsroom"" throughout the week, we will also drill down, so to speak, on aspects of the problem that you rarely see explained on television: How oil refineries work, how the availability of ""surplus gas"" from independent oil companies can play havoc with pump prices, and what effect the squeeze on oil will have on the market for alternative energy. On CNN.com and CNNMoney.com, you'll be able to compare gas prices on a state-by-state map. CNNMoney: Will oil prices kill the stock market rally? Through iReport, you can send us your own videos documenting the pain at your local pump and tell us how your own driving habits have changed. Writers on our Opinion page will debate the causes and the fallout, and in our latest of our Explain It To Me video tutorials, Velshi offers a 101 primer on why gas prices go up and down. And because this is another big week in Election 2012, our political reporters and analysts will weigh in on the implications for the presidential race. Just as President Barack Obama is nurturing a narrative of a slowly healing economy, the GOP is looking at the price of gas as Exhibit A that his administration remains a failure. But before they get to make that case in the fall, the Republicans will have to settle on a candidate, a ride that so far has been much wilder than anyone predicted. Will they be any closer after the Michigan and Arizona primaries?

"(CNN) -- ""This is a man without a core, a man without substance, a man that will say anything to become president of the United States."" Rudy Giuliani uttered these harsh words when describing Mitt Romney eight months ago. But then, four months later, Giuliani endorsed Romney. Is Giuliani correct? Is Romney truly a man ""without a core""? The simple answer: No. Romney has a distinct core -- not that of a politician, but of a CEO. What do I mean? We have become accustomed in these highly partisan times to politicians who adhere rigidly to their ideological positions. They don't change their views to attract supporters. Rather, they want voters to agree with the positions they advocate. In contrast, a CEO is not shackled by ideology. A CEO's success is measured by the bottom line, not by how many principles he or she sticks to. To the CEO, if a product is not selling, you don't stick with it until the product destroys your business. Instead, you tweak it. You rebrand it. You try a new slogan or new packaging. And if people are still not buying it, like New Coke, you drop it. You regroup, come up with a new product and then start selling again. Romney is first and foremost a businessman. In fact, Romney has repeatedly made this very point to us with statements like: ""I spent my life in the private sector, not in government. I only spent four years as a governor. I didn't inhale. I'm a business guy."" I'm not defending Romney's acrobatic flips on issues. In fact, if Romney loses this election, he would make a great circus performer. I can see the ads: ""The Amazing Romney -- he can change positions in midair."" At times, I truly wonder if Mitt realizes we have Google and can look up his record on issues. But Romney's ""evolution"" on certain key issues does not technically constitute a ""flip-flop,"" which is defined by Dictionary.com as, ""A sudden or unexpected reversal as of direction, belief, attitude or policy."" Romney's changing views are neither sudden nor unexpected. Rather, they are astutely calculated by Romney the businessman to appeal to the customers he's targeting at that very moment. This is a man clearly driven by the adage: ""The customer is always right."" For example, this week Romney declared that the individual mandate imposed by Obamacare is a tax. Yet when Romney was the governor of Massachusetts, he implemented an identical individual mandate but consistently denied it was a tax. Romney has simply modified his ""product line"" to attract the most customers based on the current marketplace conditions. Even ""Mad Men's"" Don Draper would have to be in awe of Romney's business acumen. This strategy is even more apparent when you contrast Romney's views from when he ran for office in Massachusetts with those he espoused when seeking the Republican presidential nomination. In Massachusetts, Romney fashioned a product that appealed to the left-leaning consumers who populate the state. But when seeking to sell his wares to the more conservative Republican primary market, he customized it accordingly. For example, on abortion, Romney was unequivocally pro-choice in his run for the Senate in 1994 and for governor in 2002. In fact, during a 2002 gubernatorial debate, Romney stated, ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard."" But when Romney sought the Republican nomination, he tweaked his goods to appeal to these right-leaning buyers by saying, ""I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade."" On gun control, Romney admitted during his 1994 Senate race that his views were, ""... not going to make me the hero of the NRA."" Indeed, as governor, Romney signed into law a ban on assault weapons, dubbing them ""instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people."" Flash forward to 2012. During the Republican primaries, Romney again fine-tuned his merchandise to attract the more conservative gun owners. In April, he even addressed the NRA's national convention, explaining, ""We need a president who will enforce current laws, not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners."" Romney not only revamped his product line, he also repackaged himself. During his 1994 Senate campaign, Romney told Massachusetts voters, ""I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush."" But when running for the Republican presidential nomination, he shrewdly rebranded himself as a self-described ""Reagan Republican."" For many, a CEO-style president could be a good fit. Romney's track record indicates he will likely be a pragmatic leader, not rigidly beholden to ideology. But for others like myself, Romney's CEO core and ever evolving product line lead to doubt about every word he says. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Is Mitt Romney truly a man ""without a core""? No.

"(CNN) -- To watch Whitney Houston's powerful ""home going"" service on Saturday was to be reminded that she was a one-of-a-kind talent, with a divine instrument that even in death soared above all the other famous voices that gathered at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, to celebrate her. But sadly, Houston was a dime a dozen in another aspect of her life: her dependence on drugs and alcohol. As anyone who has struggled with it or had a loved one who did can tell you, addiction does not discriminate based on talent or fame or wealth or race. It's an equal-opportunity curse and killer. I know, because I saw my father, another groundbreaking black talent of his time, brought low by it, a tragic story of brilliance and decline and the pain it can inflict on children and family that took me decades to find the strength to tell. Read more about addiction . In the media, celebrity and addiction is all too often served up only as a tabloid cocktail of scandal and gossip. But in the wake of Houston's death, we at CNN have decided to pay one last tribute to her by devoting this week to a series of In Depth stories and discussions about what can be done to fight the scourge of addiction. We start with Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. In appearances on ""Starting Point"" with Soledad O'Brien and our daytime ""CNN Newsroom"" shows, he will examine the latest breakthroughs in the brain science and biology of addiction and how they have given rise to promising new anti-substance abuse drugs. Throughout the week, Dr. Drew Pinsky will share his wisdom about the keys to beating addiction and the lessons of Whitney Houston's fall on his own prime-time show on our sister network, HLN. Celebrities and prescription drug addiction . We will hear from former addicts about how they turned their lives around, including TV sports anchor Pat O'Brien, who is sitting down with Piers Morgan, and ex-NBA great Chris Herren, who is talking to Brooke Baldwin. We will also air a series of stories about the fastest growing form of addiction in America: prescription drugs, from ""gateway pills"" like Adderall to heavy duty painkillers like Vicodin and Oxycontin. As Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr reports, the U.S. military this month announced it would start testing troops for hydrocodone (the base of Vicodin) and benzodiazepine, the key ingredient in Valium. When the military, usually the institutional gold standard in dealing with medical and psychological issues, goes that far, you know we have an epidemic on our hands. Abuse of legal drugs is also an increasing source of accidental deaths, a subject that our medical team plans to follow up on in the coming months. None of us needs to wait for Whitney Houston's toxicology reports to know that more needs to be done to combat the evils that took her from us so soon, or that we all have a responsibility to join the fight.","In an in depth series of reports this week, CNN looks at addiction .

"(CNN) -- Emergency officials in seven Mississippi counties were dealing Monday with widespread damage after a swarm of storms swept through the area Sunday evening, injuring scores of people. No deaths have been reported. Two people in Lamar County were critically hurt, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said. A tornado struck Hattiesburg, a southern Mississippi city that straddles Lamar and Forrest counties. The Weather Service described the storm as packing 170 mph winds -- an EF-4 on the service's tornadic scale. The scale ranges from EF0 to EF5. Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree reported major damage to a number of buildings. ""If there is a good thing about this, it happened on a Sunday when most of these structures were vacant,"" he said. Tornado sirens were activated 20 to 30 minutes before the twister touched down, DuPree said. ""I think that was enough for people to find shelter, to go to a place in their house that was safe,"" he added. Several homes were destroyed in Marion County, and numerous structures -- including businesses and public buildings -- sustained ""significant damage,"" the state emergency management agency said. As of Monday morning, 4,000 power customers were without electricity, down from the approximately 14,000 who had lost power, Mississippi Power spokesman Mark Davis said. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency for the affected counties. The declaration means state resources and assets can be used to support local response efforts. Some 63 people were treated at area hospitals, most of them for minor injuries, he said. Some 200 mobile homes were damaged or destroyed, and 100 apartments were damaged and uninhabitable, he said. Bryant tweeted photos of the storm damage. iReporter shopping at Target captures video of tornado . In Hattiesburg, the University of Southern Mississippi suffered damage to several buildings, but there were no reports of injuries there. The campus was already closed because of Mardi Gras and was to remain closed through Tuesday; classes were canceled through Wednesday. ""We never lost power,"" said Joe Paul, vice president for student affairs, in a statement on the school's website. ""The cafeteria is up and running, and everyone is fine."" University police declared a state of emergency and urged those not on campus to stay away until further notice. Nearby Oak Grove High School also suffered damage. Randy Wright posted photographs to his Twitter account, showing debris strewn on what appeared to be a parking lot and a truck upside down in a baseball diamond. The Hattiesburg Public School District canceled classes Monday. ""There's quite a few homes without power at this point,"" Forrest County Sheriff Billy McGee said. ""Quite a few trees on houses, on cars, that type of thing."" Ten to 15 people were hospitalized, but none suffered serious injuries, he said. It was not clear how those people were hurt. Sarah Lawrence, a Hattiesburg resident, said the storm sounded like ""stuff being thrown."" ""Within seconds, everything changed,"" she said. ""I didn't feel like there was much notice.

"(CNN) -- A railroad station crush left 36 people dead Sunday among tens of millions of Hindu pilgrims flocking to the banks of the Ganges River for the world's largest religious gathering, authorities reported. The stampede occurred about 7 p.m. after someone fell from a platform bridge in Allahabad, the scene of this year's Kumbh Mela festival, North-Central Railway spokesman Sandeep Mathur said. He said the station was overcrowded with pilgrims, but denied reports that the bridge had collapsed. In addition to the 36 killed, more than 30 people were injured in the stampede, according to Mathur. Earlier, 10 people were reported dead. An estimated 40 million people came to Allahabad, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, on Sunday to bathe at the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges rivers and the mythical Saraswati River. It's the most significant Hindu pilgrimage, occurring every 12 years, Indian cultural and political observer K. G. Suresh said. ""The Hindus believe that a dip in the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and the Saraswati on this occasion helps get rid of all worldly sins,"" Suresh said. Sunday was the main day for bathing of the 55-day Kumbh Mela. In Hindu mythology, Allahabad is one of the four places where drops of the ""nectar of immortality"" contained in a pitcher fell to earth as gods and demons fought for it. The holy bathing began on Saturday afternoon and peaked after midnight, festival official Satish Kumar Sharma said. More than 12,000 police officers were guarding the nearly 20-square-kilometer (7.7-square-mile) site, India's government said. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the deaths and promised to extend ""all possible help"" to state authorities. ""I send my heartfelt condolences to the members of the bereaved families and wish those injured a speedy recovery,"" Singh said in a statement issued by his office. He pledged that those injured and the families of those killed would receive compensation.","NEW: In addition to the dead, over 30 were hurt in Allahabad, a railway spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Marion Rolland had never won a major race before, but she fulfilled a lifelong dream on Sunday when she claimed the prestigious women's downhill title at the Alpine Skiing World Championships in Austria. With 2011 silver medalist and Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn ruled out for the season after crashing on the opening day in Schladming, the gold was up for grabs -- but no-one expected Rolland to take it. Ranked 10th in the World Cup downhill standings this season, and 29th overall, the 30-year-old made a late surge to glory as she headed off Nadia Fanchini by just 0.16 seconds to earn France's third gold of the championships.

"(CNN) -- A 5-year-old Croatian girl with leukemia will be receiving treatment in America, thanks to her home country's generosity. When Nora Situm's mother contacted Croatian media to help raise the $575,000 needed for her daughter's treatment, they made sure that goal was met. ""It was very expensive, but Croatian people have great hearts,"" said Djurdja Aleksic, a family friend and a member of Hrabro dijete (brave child), an organization that helps sick children. Nora is known in her home country as brave heart, according to Aleksic. ""She is a very sick little girl, but very strong,"" she said. Within weeks of her mother's request, people from all over Croatia donated to Nora's cause, according to Aleksic. Nora was due to arrive late Thursday or early Friday for treatment at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The effort was impressive, given Croatia's feeble economy. Between 2000 and 2007, the country's economy improved slowly, according to the CIA World Factbook. But Croatia has yet to recover from an abrupt slowdown in 2008, the CIA said. A flap arose when people heard that an additional $262,000 may be needed for long-term follow-up care for Nora. People took to the hospital's Facebook page, upset about the charge, but a person who identified herself as a part of Nora's family said there was a misunderstanding in correspondence with the hospital and asked people to stop posting negative comments. Children's Hospital, in a statment sent to CNN Wednesday, said ""we try to ensure that all international families understand the difference between the initial costs of treatment charged by CHOP, which does not change, and the potential future costs which will depend on future clinical treatments."" The hospital does not charge for follow-up treatment at the time of initial treatment and will not ask for it if the child does not receive further treatment, it said. Fortunately, according to Aleksic, the public and the Croatian government donated money to cover the additional amount, if it proves necessary.","Nora Situm, 5, has leukemia and will receive treatment at Philadelphia hospital .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans and Democrats in the Senate agreed Thursday that they would prefer a new education bill to the current use of waivers by the Obama administration that bypass the No Child Left Behind Act, which is more than five years overdue for an overhaul. ""The bottom line is that it expired in 2007 except for a provision that says if Congress didn't act, it would continue; and Congress didn't act, so it's continuing,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. ""That's our fault. That's on us,"" Alexander added. Education Secretary Arne Duncan appeared before the committee to give an update on his use of waivers for states who are unable to meet the criteria set out in the No Child Act so the state can still receive federal education funding until Congress reauthorizes the program. ""Providing waivers was always, always our plan B. But I was not willing to stand idly by and do nothing while students and educators continue to suffer under No Child Left Behind,"" the secretary said. The waivers have been controversial among Republicans who object to the stipulations that the Obama administration puts onto many states before they are awarded. ""This simple waiver authority has turned into a conditional waiver with the secretary basically having more authority to make decisions that in my view should be made locally by state and local governments,"" Alexander said. If Congress comes up with a deal to reauthorize NCLB, which is the current version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), Duncan said his understanding is that the waivers would become obsolete. According to the education secretary, 34 states and the District of Columbia have been granted the waivers while nine states, Puerto Rico and the Bureau of Indian Education have requests under consideration. The deadline to apply for the waivers is at the end of February. During the last Congress a bill out of the Senate committee to reauthorize ESEA, That bill died at the end of the session without ever making it to the Senate floor for debate. A series of smaller bills were passed out of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce that dealt with ESEA topics last year. One of those bills that dealt with Charter Schools made it to the House floor for debate and was passed, but died at the end of the last session with no action from the Senate. ""It's no secret that for many years Congress has been dysfunctional,"" Duncan said. ""My team and I put in hundreds and hundreds of hours in what proved to be a fruitless effort over the past two years. In all candor, I would like to have gone to waivers earlier.""","Inaction by Congress has left No Child Left Behind Act in effect despite 2007 sunset .

"Big Bear Lake, California (CNN) -- The Los Angeles Police Department will reopen its investigation into the firing of an officer that prompted alleged revenge attacks as the hunt for the man accused of killing three people widened in Southern California's San Bernardino Mountains. Christopher Jordan Dorner declared war on police in a manifesto after being fired by the LAPD and losing appeals to be reinstated, claiming that racism in the police department was behind him losing his job. ""I feel we need to publicly address Dorner's allegations regarding his termination,"" LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said in a statement released Saturday. ""...I do this not to appease a murderer. I do it to reassure the public that their police department is transparent and fair in all things we do."" Beck ordered a re-examination of all evidence and new interviews with all witnesses connected to Dorner's 2009 firing after the LAPD ruled that he lied two years earlier in a complaint he filed against his training officer. ""I am aware of the ghosts of the LAPD's past, and one of my biggest concerns is that they will be resurrected by Dorner's allegations of racism within the department,"" Beck said. 'Last resort' In the manifesto posted online, 33-year-old Dorner promised to bring ""unconventional and asymmetrical warfare"" to officers and their families, calling it the ""last resort"" to clear his name and strike back at a department he says mistreated him. According to authorities, Dorner began making good on his threats a week ago when he allegedly killed Monica Quan and her fiance, Keith Lawrence, in a parking lot in Irvine, south of Los Angeles. Quan was the daughter of a now-retired Los Angeles police officer who represented Dorner in a disciplinary hearing that led resulted in his termination. Timeline in hunt for Dorner . Days later, early Thursday morning, Dorner allegedly opened fire on two LAPD police officers, wounding one, in the suburban city of Corona. Roughly 20 minutes later, Dorner allegedly fired on two police officers, killing one and wounding another, in the nearby city of Riverside. Widening manhunt . Since then, much of the manhunt for Dorner has focused in and around the San Bernardino County mountaintop resort of Big Bear Lake after Dorner's pickup was found burning in the area. As the dragnet entered its fourth day Sunday, the manhunt widened with the creation of a joint task force that brought together state and local law enforcement officials along with the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service. ""We will look under every rock. We will look around every corner. We will search every mountaintop,"" Riverside Asst. Police Chief Chris Vicino told reporters Saturday. In the snow-packed San Bernardino Mountains, officers trudged through fresh snow as they searched homes, knocking on doors and peeking in windows, for Dorner. But as the search continued with no sign of Dorner, questions were raised about whether he escaped the dragnet -- possibly days earlier. Arrest warrant . A federal arrest warrant affidavit said Dorner's burned-out truck was found on the property of a known associate in the Big Bear Lake area Thursday afternoon. There has been no sign of Dorner since Thursday, and there has been speculation, based in part on the affidavit, that he has possibly crossed state lines into Nevada or made his way into Mexico. Authorities say Dorner spent at least two days in the San Diego area following the shooting of Quan and her fiance. Dorner's ID and some of his personal belongings were found Thursday at the San Ysidro Point of Entry at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the affidavit. Border patrol agents have been searching cars crossing into Mexico for signs of Dorner, while authorities have searched a home Dorner owned in Las Vegas and one owned by his mother in La Palma, California. Two sailors also reported Dorner, a former Navy lieutenant, approached them at the San Diego-area Point Loma Naval Base, and local police allege he attempted to steal a boat. Even so, the focus of the manhunt remains on the San Bernardino Mountains where the search has been slowed by heavy snowfall. Search teams were aided by helicopters, snowcats and armored personnel carriers with snow chains. On alert . Los Angeles-area police and a number of military installations have been on alert since the shootings, while authorities chase down a number of unconfirmed sightings of the 270-pound, 6-foot Dorner. In the manifesto and on a Facebook page, Dorner allegedly singled out as targets a number of officers and their families, who have been under guard since the shootings. The LAPD chief on Saturday described the police shooting of two women who were driving a pickup similar to the one Dorner owned as a ""tragic, horrific incident."" In an interview with CNN affiliate KCBS, Beck said the shootings of Margie Carranza, 47, and her mother, 71-year-old Emma Hernandez, occurred a day after the manhunt for Dorner began. He said the officers were under enormous pressure. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton and Irving Last contributed to this report. Paul Vercammen and Stan Wilson reported from Big Bear Lake. Chelsea J.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Duke University official is accused of offering his 5-year-old adopted son for sex on the Internet, according to the FBI and court documents in the case. Frank M. Lombard is the associate director of Duke University's Center for Health Policy. Frank M. Lombard, 42, was arrested last week at his home in Durham, North Carolina. During an Internet chat, Lombard allegedly offered the child to the person he was chatting with, who was a task force officer from Washington's Metropolitan Police, the FBI said in a statement. The chat was initiated after a confidential source facing child pornography charges told authorities they had witnessed a man, allegedly Lombard, performing sex acts on a child over the Internet. During the chat, according to the complaint filed against Lombard, he told the officer that he had performed multiple sex acts on the boy and that the officer could do the same if he came to Durham. According to a transcript of the chat, reprinted in the complaint, Lombard allegedly told the officer that he had to hide the abuse from his partner and that he drugged the child with allergy medication. Lombard was arrested June 24, and two children at the home, including the 5-year-old, were removed from the home by the North Carolina Department of Social Services, the FBI said. Lombard is the associate director of Duke University's Center for Health Policy, but was placed on unpaid administrative leave, effective immediately, last week, university spokesman Keith Lawrence said. The center is described on its Web site as a joint venture among the university's law, business and arts-and-sciences schools and ""an instigator and facilitator of a broad range of research related to public health and the policies that address it."" Lombard faces federal child sex abuse charges, which carry a prison sentence of up to 20 years upon conviction, authorities said. He made an initial appearance in federal court in North Carolina but was transferred to Washington to face the charges there, court documents show. Attempts to contact the Durham attorney who appeared in court with Lombard were unsuccessful Tuesday. Federal agents seized Lombard's computer, thumb drives, Web cams and other items when executing a search warrant upon Lombard's arrest, according to court documents.","Man allegedly offered 5-year-old during Internet chat with undercover police officer .

"(CNN) -- Anyone who has complained that today's movie industry lacks imagination, ambition and originality (and who hasn't?) had better take a look at ""Cloud Atlas."" The new film from ""The Matrix"" siblings Andy and Lana Wachowski, and their co-conspirator Tom Tykwer (""Run Lola Run""), spans centuries and continents, tells six separate stories and casts a dozen actors in three or more roles apiece. There is enough ambition and audacity here to fill an entire multiplex, astonishing spectacle and philosophical heft to match. It's a bravura, rogue movie, the kind that has no business getting made. Does it work? No, not really -- not for me -- but there is something truly wondrous about a folly on this scale. I'll take it over another efficient cookie-cutter flick any day of the week. David Mitchell's 2004 Booker-nominated novel begins midstream, well into what purports to be the diary of an innocent 19th century lawyer traveling the South Pacific in the company of unscrupulous mariners and brigands. In a kind of literary relay, this manuscript is devoured by a young apprentice composer in the 1930s, who comments on it in his letters to his male lover. Letters that turn up 40 years later when the lover -- a nuclear scientist -- is embroiled in a deadly corruption cover-up, which is the basis in turn for a pulp suspense novel read by a cranky British publisher, and so on and so forth -- all the way into the 23rd century and beyond. 'Cloud Atlas' draws mixed reviews from TIFF . By most lights this would qualify as ""unfilmable"" (it's also brilliant - do read it), but apparently not. The movie adaptation is actually quite faithful, an honest and somewhat successful attempt to visualize Mitchell's shifting epochs and recurring themes. It is more fragmented, though. Where Mitchell explores his stories in large, discreet chunks, the filmmakers have sliced and diced them into far shorter sequences, so that it's not always clear which century we're in or what's going on, or why. The tactic is disorienting, but also distracts from how thin some of these stories actually are, once they have been boiled down to narrative essentials. Six tales in just under three hours -- that's less than 30 minutes each, not long enough to delve beneath the surface. The novel plays with literary form and adopts a different authorial voice for each tale. The movie switches between costume drama to comedy to paranoia thriller to sci-fi fantasy, but seems flat in comparison. There's not much momentum or suspense to keep the ship afloat, just a prevailing curiosity about how on earth everything connects. We're invited to pick out correspondences and motifs across the years, from the comet-shaped birthmark that crops up several times to a haunting melody that outlives its composer, as well as wider patterns of prejudice, repression, resistance and rebellion. The movie's politics are strikingly progressive and sophisticated. But the filmmakers' reach often exceeds their grasp. Tom Hanks talks 'Cloud Atlas' and more . What is exhilarating and impressive in the design is often undone in the detail. It makes some conceptual sense to cast the same actors in numerous roles -- it implies something about the human struggle and what one character calls ""perpetual recurrence"" -- but disguised and coated in layers of makeup, the stars (they include Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw) repeatedly default to crass caricature. The dramaturgy is frequently jarringly crude and ham-fisted; frenzied comic relief fails to hit the mark (Mitchell's very dry, English sense of humor eludes them). There are fleeting moments of inspiration -- the Wachowskis are clearly in their element in the corporatized neo-Seoul of the not-so distant future -- but a post-apocalyptic episode where everyone speaks an incomprehensible invented pidgin cries out for cutting, and the earliest seafaring tale is also a very long haul.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Three Chinese ships entered into waters near small islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries on Friday morning and were staying despite a warning from a Japanese Coast Guard ship, the coast guard said. The move continues a dispute over the islands -- which Japan calls Senkaku and China calls Diaoyu -- that stretches back decades. Last week, Japan scrambled fighter jets near the small islands in the East China Sea after a Chinese plane was seen there. Chinese government ships have repeatedly entered the waters around the remote, rocky islands since the Japanese government announced in September it was buying several of the islands from private owners. Japanese Coast Guard vessels have engaged in games of cat and mouse with the Chinese ships, with both sides broadcasting messages to one another insisting they have territorial sovereignty over the area. Analysts say that by sending its own patrols into the area, China is challenging Japan's de facto control of the islands, which has been the status quo for the past 40 years.","3 Chinese ships entered Japanese territorial waters, coast guard says .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal is on course for a comeback double as he bids for two titles at the VTR Open in Chile on Sunday. The 11-time grand slam champion will seek his 37th clay-court crown and 51st overall when he takes on 73rd-ranked Argentine Horacio Zeballos in the singles final at Vina del Mar. He will then team up with another Argentine, last year's tournament winner Juan Monaco, in the doubles final against Italy's Paolo Lorenzi and Potito Starace. ""I'm really happy with what I've been doing this week,"" said the Spaniard, who has dropped to fifth in the rankings after being sidelined for over seven months due to knee problems. ""I have a good feeling on the court, so I cannot ask for anything more. I will try to play better and better every day."" ""I won't compare myself to seven months ago, it's just the first week of competition. It's a great feeling to be in a final match after so much time without playing."" Nadal's first real test of the week came in Saturday's semifinal against 26th-ranked French third seed Jeremy Chardy, but he had no problems in cruising to a 6-2 6-2 victory. ""I played well today, better than the days before, which is important,"" he said. Zeballos, meanwhile, reached the second ATP World Tour final of his career -- the other being in St. Petersburg in 2009 -- by beating eighth-seeded compatriot Carlos Berlocq 6-3 7-6 (7-4). Richard Gasquet became the first player to win twice on the ATP Tour this year as he beat compatriot Benoit Paire 6-2 6-3 in Sunday's final of the Open Sud de France in Montpellier. The 10th-ranked Frenchman has a 14-1 record in 2013, having won the Qatar title in January before losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open. In other men's news, Nadal's great rival Roger Federer will return to action in Rotterdam this week as he defends his World Tennis Tournament title. The world No. 2, who lost to Andy Murray in the Melbourne semifinals last month, will play 60th-ranked Slovenian Grega Zemlja in his opening match. In women's action, Petra Kvitova put the Czech Republic into the semifinals of Fed Cup on Sunday, as her 2-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 win over Samantha Stosur gave the two-time defending champions an unbeatable 3-0 lead against Australia in Prague. The 2011 Wimbledon champion saved a match-point at 5-4 down in the second set against that year's U.S. Open victor Stosur. Kvitova's teammates Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka then beat Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua 6-0 7-6 (7-1). The Czechs will next face Italy, who edged the United States 3-2 in Rimini. Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci beat Liezel Huber and Varvara Lepchenko 6-2 6-2 in the decisive doubles rubber. Russia also went to a decider against Japan before sealing a semifinal clash with Slovakia. Japan leveled at 2-2 in Moscow as home No. 1 Maria Kirilenko was unable to play due to illness, as Ayumi Morita triumphed 6-4 6-1 against stand-in Elena Vesnina, but Ekatarina Makarova bounced back from her Saturday defeat to beat Kimiko Date-Krumm 6-1 6-1. She then teamed up with Vesnina in a 6-2 6-2 doubles victory over Morita and Misaki Doi. Slovakia took an unbeatable 3-1 lead against last year's finalists Serbia as Daniela Hantuchova won 6-3 6-2 against Vesna Dolonc.","Former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal reaches singles final in Chile comeback tournament .

"(LonelyPlanet.com) -- Have you ever visited a building that gave you the creeps? These 10 buildings around the world are guaranteed to send a shiver down your spine. 1. Wat Rong Khun, Chang Rai, Thailand . Still under construction, Chiang Rai's controversial modern temple is part traditional Buddhist temple, part white-frosted wedding cake, and part avant-garde art with a disturbing penchant for pointiness. Visitors must cross a bridge to the temple over a field of fangs and hundreds of pleading white arms and suffering faces of statues reaching up from hell. While stark whiteness predominates, the inside and other parts of the temple compound (including the toilets) are sparkling gold. Wat Rong Khun is open daily; the White Temple is a short drive from Chiang Rai. 2. Sedlec Ossuary, Kutná Hora, Czech Republic . By the mid-1800s, the crypt at the Sedlec monastery had been a popular burial site for centuries, with plague outbreaks and Hussite Wars contributing thousands of remains. In the 1870s a local woodcarver was hired to make creative use of the bones that had been piling up in the crypt. This was no minor task: the ossuary contains the remains of over 40,000 people, many of which were used to decorate the chapel. The effect is as beautiful as it is macabre: elaborate light fixtures, arrays of bells, furnishings, splashy wall treatments and coats of arms are all loving recreated from skulls and bones of all sizes. Is that chandelier staring back at you? To reach the monastery, drag your bones 800m south from Kutná Hora's main train station. More gory details at www.kostnice.cz. Lonely Planet: How to travel like a kid . 3. Ryugyong Hotel, Pyongyang, North Korea . Under construction since 1987, the massive and still unfinished 105-story Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang looks like a luxury hotel designed for Mordor. Nicknamed the 'Hotel of Doom' and described as 'the worst building in the history of mankind' by Esquire, construction halted due to lack of funding, and the partially completed building stood windowless and looming ominously over the city for 16 years before work resumed in 2008. Strikingly modern when first designed, time has not been kind to the building, which now looks simultaneously menacing, dated, and unconscionably extravagant relative to the impoverished populace. Once granted a visa, visitors to North Korea have little choice in where they are allowed to visit or photograph, but at 105 stories, the Ryugyong Hotel is hard to miss from anywhere in the capital. 4. Dongyue Temple, Běijīng, China . Běijīng's most morbid shrine, the operating Taoist shrine of Dongyue Temple is an unsettling but fascinating place to visit. Stepping through the entrance you find yourself in Taoist Hades, where tormented spirits reflect on their wrongdoings. The 'Life and Death Department' is a spiritual place to ponder your eventual demise, the 'Department for Wandering Ghosts' and the 'Department for Implementing 15 Kinds of Violent Death' have slightly less inviting names, while the ill might seek out the 'Deep-Rooted Disease Department'. Other halls are less morbid, but no less interesting. Visit during the Chinese New Year or the Mid-Autumn Festival to see the temple at its most vibrant. Paying the extra Yuan for a guide can be helpful for interpreting the aspects of the temple that might otherwise defy explanation. 5. Lemp Mansion, St Louis, USA . Reputed to be one of the USA's most haunted houses (if there are degrees of hauntedness), St Louis' Lemp Mansion has a long history of odd occurrences. Charles Lemp committed suicide in the house in 1949 and, ever since, strange things have taken place at the house, including doors that swing open spontaneously, glasses that leap off tables and break, and a tragically short-lived reality TV show. Today, the mansion operates as a restaurant and inn that capitalizes on the morbid fame through murder mystery dinner theatre, Halloween parties and weekly tours by a noted 'paranormal investigator'. Stay the night if you dare. The mansion can be found just off I-55, south of the Anheuser-Busch Brewery. Find more information on spooky events and reservations at www.lempmansion.com. 6. Scott Monument, Edinburgh, Scotland . A spiky Gothic fantasy with more than a passing resemblance to a Thai temple, the monument to Sir Walter Scott is a beloved fixture of the Edinburgh skyline. Just 61m high, the climb to the top doesn't sound daunting until you find yourself wedged into the preposterously tiny spiral staircase. The final curve is so notoriously tight that squeezing yourself out the final doorway requires the flexibility of a spelunker. Edinburgh mystery writer Ian Rankin once set the scene of the crime at the top of the Scott Monument, with much of the story focusing on the physics of getting a stiff cadaver down the twisty staircase. Not a claustrophobe? This might make you think otherwise. For history and seasonal visiting hours, see www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk. Lonely Planet: Hotels where famous people have died . 7. Catacombe dei Cappuccini, Palermo, Italy . All of the inhabitants of the catacombs below Palermo's Capuchin Monastery are decked out in their Sunday best. Unfortunately, that Sunday was several hundred years ago, and the outfits have fared significantly better that the wearers. The mummified bodies and skeletons of some 8000 Palermitans from the 1600s through to the 1800s are kept in the catacombs for all to see, some so well preserved that they look eerily lifelike. Men and women occupy separate corridors, and within the women's area there's a special virgin-only section. Spooky for adults, probably terrifying for the kiddies - be warned. The catacombs are a 15-minute walk from Palermo's Piazza Independenza along Via Cappuccini or a short bus ride. 8. Chernobyl Reactor #4, Ukraine . Famously the site of the world's biggest nuclear disaster in 1986, the 30km-radius exclusion zone is mostly uninhabited today, but limited tours have been available since 2002 for travelers who are curious enough to get a glimpse of the industrial ghost town and aren't put off by the ominous click of a Geiger counter. Factories, homes, schools, and a particularly creepy abandoned amusement park stand decaying and choked with weeds, but remain much as they looked at the time of disaster. The Ukrainian government has indicated that the exclusion zone will be increasingly open to travelers in the coming years. Just don't step on the radioactive moss. The best way to visit Chernobyl is to use one of the several Kiev-based agencies such as Solo East or New Logic. 9. Ottawa Jail Hostel, Canada . Want to spend the night in the slammer? Why not make it a jail haunted by the spirits of former inmates and deemed unsuitable for prisoners in the early1970s due to appalling conditions? Opened in 1862, the Carleton County Gaol was in operation for over a century, but it was hardly a hit with the prisoners who complained of cramped conditions and sanitation problems. It might not have been suitable for prisoners at the time, but if you're a traveler on a tight budget and don't mind that your room happens to be a prison cell and your bunkmate might be spectral, it's perfect. As a 'prisoner' today, your punishment includes parking, wifi, and a games lounge. To get yourself locked up for the night in the Canadian capital, search availability here. 10. White Alice, Alaska, USA . A gold-rush town a century ago and the finishing line for the Iditarod dog-sled race today, Nome is the perfect example of a honky-tonk, almost-at-the-Arctic-Circle frontier town. Overlooking the town and the Bering Straits from the top of Anvil Mountain is White Alice, a weird Cold War relic. From down in the town it looks like a bizarre space-age Stonehenge, closer up it could be a film set for a shoot of the Victorian-era War of the Worlds. The four strange corrugated-iron sound reflector structures were intended for listening to suspicious Soviet activity. For a real Alaskan experience visit White Alice during the midnight sun: Nome and the Bering Straits at your feet, the Arctic Circle just to the north and Siberia not far west.

"(CNN) -- Law enforcement officials seized 300 kilograms of cocaine from a yacht in a coastal town off of Queensland, the Australian Federal Police said. The cocaine, with a street value of up to $79 million, was found stashed in the hull of the yacht by police this past Friday. Police arrested four Spanish nationals in connection with the raid. The bust is believed to be the fifth largest cocaine seizure in Australian history, police said on Monday in a news release. The yacht, named Friday Freedom, was under close investigation by the Australian Federal Police for its links to an organized crime syndicate and was tracked as it headed from Vanuatu to Australia on October 14. Two of the Spanish nationals arrested were living aboard the yacht and another two were arrested after they were discovered allegedly meeting the yacht in the northeastern coastal town of Bundaberg. Police also seized an additional $3 million in cash in searches related to the seizure. The four arrested appeared in a Bundaberg court on Monday to face charges related to importing cocaine. Australia Associated Press reports they remain in custody and another hearing is set for January 12. If convicted, they could face life in prison. Authorities said this is the second significant cocaine seizure on a yacht in just over 12 months.","Australia law enforcement officials seize 300 kilograms of cocaine from yacht .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A veteran Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy and his younger partner sat tensely in their car Thursday in the same patrol district where a former LAPD cop -- now on the run, accused in three killings -- used to work. The two deputies were ""on the edge,"" they said, monitoring the police radio and the latest news about the rogue ex-cop who has pledged to kill officers in and out of uniform. Their marked cruiser was ensconced beneath soaring concrete columns supporting the light-rail Expo Line. In an off-limits parking spot by a ""Do Not Enter"" sign, their car faced passing traffic, and the two officers stood watch, wondering whether Christopher Jordan Dorner would pass their way. ""Everyone is a lot more on edge,"" said one of the deputies, a 24-year veteran, who was in uniform with a bulletproof vest and his sidearm. ""We're just doing a lot more careful observation. ""We're listening to the news like you. Everyone has got their eyes open,"" said the deputy, who asked that his name not be published due to security concerns. ""He's a scary guy."" His partner, sitting behind the wheel, let the senior deputy do much of the talking, but when he paused to listen to the radio, the six-year deputy chimed in. Timeline in manhunt for former L.A. cop . ""We're just being more observant,"" he said, frequently looking toward the morning traffic speeding by the La Cienega Boulevard station. Normally, the two officers would be riding the Expo Line, checking passengers for proof of fare payment. The officers are common fixtures on the new rail line, which opened last year, and walk through the train cars, issuing tickets for passengers who haven't paid their fare. That rail line runs through the heart of the southwest division of the Los Angeles Police Department, the district where Dorner, a former LAPD officer, had been assigned for patrol duty while on the force. Dorner has allegedly written a manifesto pledging ""asymmetrical warfare"" on officers in and out of uniform, particularly LAPD officers, but the sheriff's deputies were taking the threat to include them, too. All 10,000 officers in the LAPD were on ""tac alert"" Thursday, including Officers Ryan Lee and John Negrete, who were patrolling the same division where Dorner had worked. Under a tactical alert, all officers are in uniform or available for duty. Also, all motorcycle officers were taken off the street and put in patrol cars Thursday for their own protection, Los Angeles Police said. Suspect's grudge dates back to 2007 complaint . Lee and Negrete didn't mind giving their names to a CNN reporter because they expressed confidence in their department's numbers. ""We're maxed deployed,"" Lee said, behind the wheel, idling the parked black-and-white. ""I don't think he'll bring the fight into L.A. I think he has a better chance with a smaller department. We have so many resources."" It was clear from their manner of speech that all officers were at the ready. ""These types of events band officers and departments together, and I guess his trying to bring the fight to officers, well, he knows better,"" added Lee, a 10-year veteran. ""His manifesto to exonerate himself doesn't make sense."" Negrete, who's been on the force for 13 years, expressed hope for a peaceful capture of Dorner. ""I just read bits and pieces of his manifesto and I just hope he's taken into custody so nobody and no officer gets hurt,"" said Negrete. Lee and Negrete didn't have a news radio in the car, so the only way they can get news updates is through Twitter on their cell phones, they said. ""The department holds this stuff close to their vest. I know there's a lot going on,"" Lee said about the manhunt for Dorner. The officers were given some information about Dorner during roll call, and some fellow cops remarked they knew of Dorner but didn't offer much more, Lee and Negrete said. ""For us patrol guys, it's just get in your car and we'll call if we need you,"" Lee said of the chain of command. The partners were assigned to watch for potential problems at an anti-homophobia campaign in the African-American neighborhood of Leimert Park, at Crenshaw Boulevard and 46th Street. In The Meantime Men's Group was conducting free HIV testing and passing out condoms on Thursday, which was National Black HIV Awareness Day. Opponents had earlier covered up a billboard sign sponsored by the group that said ""Homophobia, Racism and HIV Can't Stop Me,"" and the two officers were watching for any trouble. There was none, said the group's executive director, Jeffrey King. Alleged cop-killer details threats to LAPD, why he was driven to violence . Dorner's alleged rampage was portrayed by authorities as revenge killings for his termination from the LAPD. Dorner was an LAPD officer from 2005 to 2008, when he was terminated, according to authorities. The former officer claimed in a manifesto attributed to him that he was unfairly fired after reporting excessive force by a fellow officer, and he vowed to avenge his termination. He also served as a former U.S. Navy Reserve lieutenant who worked with river warfare units and a mobile inshore undersea warfare unit, according to Pentagon records obtained by CNN. His last day with the Navy was February 1. Dorner is a suspect in a double murder Sunday in Irvine, California, authorities said. One victim was the daughter of retired Los Angeles Police Officer Randal Quan, who handled the appeal of Dorner's termination and, according to the manifesto, bungled it. Dorner appealed the case to a Los Angeles court, where a judge ruled against him in 2011, according to court records. Multiple law enforcement agencies have linked Dorner, 33, to the shooting of two Riverside police officers in an ambush at an intersection around 1:30 a.m. Thursday. One officer, 34, died. About 20 minutes earlier, police believe Dorner shot at two LAPD officers assigned to protect off-duty officers named in Dorner's manifesto, police said. A bullet grazed one of the officers, and the wound was not life-threatening. Damage to the squad car prevented the officers from pursuing Dorner, police said. That shooting took place in Corona, also located in Riverside County, at 1:25 a.m. Thursday, said Los Angeles police. For a former officer to be a suspected cop killer is beyond imagination for many law enforcement officers, whose culture bonds them so tightly that many can spot another officer out of uniform just by their demeanor and a nod of the head. The two sheriff's deputies acknowledged this subculture. When asked how alarming it must be for a former officer to be at war with police, the younger deputy expressed acceptance. ""I guess it shows we're people too,"" he said.","Two LAPD cops patrol in the ex-cop's old beat, saying they ""don't think he'll bring the fight into L.A.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Christina Aguilera tumbled, Bob Dylan strained to be heard and Lady Gaga turned up in an egg costume -- just one of the many memorable moments from the 53rd annual Grammy Awards. Aguilera, who fumbled recently while singing the national anthem at the Super Bowl, slipped and nearly fell at the end of a tribute to Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin. The ceremony Sunday night included other highlights as well. Millions of television screens reverted to black and white for a few minutes during a performance by Bruno Mars. Full list of winners . It was a section of the show that emphasized the connections current popular music has to the past, on a night where several music legends teamed with new stars, including Barbra Streisand, Mick Jagger and Dylan. But it was an independent rock band from Canada, Arcade Fire, that took the night's biggest prize, the album of the year Grammy. The band seemed surprised when it won the award -- one member's first words on stage were ""What the hell?"" Mars sang his hit ""Grenade,"" a performance that echoed back to the 1950s and Sam Cooke, or the 1960s and Otis Redding. Janelle Monae followed with a futuristic soul performance of her song ""Cold War,"" which brought the Staples Center crowd to its feet for a long standing ovation. Rihanna made a triumphant return to the Grammys, two years after she canceled her performance hours after she was beaten by then-boyfriend Chris Brown. Rihanna teamed with rapper Eminem to perform their ""Love the Way You Lie,"" a record of the year contender. Joining the duo on stage were Skylar Grey and Dr. Dre.It was Dre's first live television performance in more than a decade. Eminem was later handed a Grammy for best rap album for ""Recovery,"" the best selling CD of 2010. It was his second Grammy for the day, counting one awarded during the pre-telecast show for best rap solo. Rihanna, who appeared to have recovered from her bout with the flu, also delivered a steamy rendition of her hit ""What's My Name"" with best new artist nominee Drake. Lady Antebellum took home five Grammys, including for song of the year, record of the year and best country album for ""Need You Now."" The group also got two Grammys in the pre-telecast show. Jazz bassist and singer Esperanza Spalding beat out Drake and Justin Bieber to win the best new artist award. The show opened with a ""get-well card"" to Franklin, who is recovering from an undisclosed illness. Yolanda Adams, Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride and best new artist nominee Florence Welch sang a soulful montage of Franklin's hits, including ""A Natural Woman,"" ""Ain't No Way,"" ""Knock On Your Door,"" ""Think,"" ""Baby I Love You"" and ""Respect."" Franklin did not attend, but instead a video message was played. ""I especially want to thank all of you who took the time to send me get well cards and flowers, beautiful flowers, and most importantly your prayers during my time of hospitalization,"" Franklin said. ""I wish I could have been with you tonight,"" Franklin said. ""But next year, OK?"" The star power from the past included Streisand, who sang her 1976 Grammy and Oscar winning song, ""Evergreen."" It was the theme song for ""A Star Is Born,"" the film in which she starred with Kris Kristofferson, who introduced Streisand. Mick Jagger paid tribute to songwriter Solomon Burke, who died last October, by singing Burke's ""Everybody Needs Somebody to Love."" The Rolling Stones covered the song on a 1965 album. Dylan sang and played his harmonica with best new artist nominee Mumford and Sons, and rising roots rockers, the Avett Brothers, in a salute to the comeback of acoustic music. A musical tribute to country legend Dolly Parton featured Norah Jones, Keith Urban and John Mayer singing her song ""Jolene."" Lady Gaga popped out of a giant egg on stage at the start of her performance of ""Born This Way,"" a song with a message about gay and lesbian rights. Gaga, who wore a raw meat dress on another red carpet last year, arrived inside the egg for the Grammys. Gaga was ""incubating,"" her creative director Lauri Ann Gibson said. ""It was necessary to incubate her for a certain time, because tonight she is actually birthing a new race,"" Gibson said. ""A new race that doesn't have the ability to judge or hate in their DNA, so she is incubating right now so she goes through that process."" Gaga, whose ""Bad Romance"" won her two Grammys during the pre-telecast show, was given the best pop vocal album Grammy during the telecast for ""The Fame Monster."" British alternative rock band Muse won the best rock album Grammy for ""The Resistance."" Miranda Lambert won her first Grammy, taking home the best female country vocal award for her song ""The House That Built Me."" ""Thank you, and I love country music,"" Lambert said. Train won the first Grammy handed out on the telecast. It was for best pop duo or group performance with vocals. ""Thanks, Justin Bieber, for not being in a duo or a group,"" Train lead singer Patrick Monahan said. A mini-tribute to the four-year career of the 16-year-old pop sensation included video of an even younger Bieber auditioning for his eventual mentor, Usher. Bieber sang a montage of three songs with Usher and actor Jaden Smith, the 12-year-old son of actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. Cee Lo revamped his hit ""F-k You"" into ""Forget You"" so he could perform the record of the year contender on the broadcast. He was accompanied by Jim Henson's Muppets and Gwyneth Paltrow. It was a colorful performance, strikingly reminiscent of Elton John's guest appearance on the Muppets. With 98 of the 109 awards presented pre-telecast, producers had plenty of time for entertainment during the 3 1/2-hour live show on CBS. Jeff Beck, Legend and Jay-Z each won three Grammys in the pre-telecast presentations, while BeBe & CeCe Winans, the ""Crazy Heart"" soundtrack and Usher gained two trophies. Jazz legend Herbie Hancock added two Grammys to his extensive collection, one for improvised jazz solo and one for best pop collaboration with vocals. With 14 of the trophies on his shelf, Hancock said winning them never gets old. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report .","Arcade Fire takes album of the year .

"(EW.com) -- Identity Thief (CinemaScore: B) fared even better than expected, bringing in $36.6 million over the weekend across 3,141 theaters. For comparison, Melissa McCarthy's last major film Bridesmaids (though it was in a supporting role) opened at $26.2 million, in 2,918 theaters. With an opening like this, big things are surely expected from Seth Gordon's R-rated comedy which has already surpassed its $35 million production budget. Though Bateman and Gordon had a successful run with Horrible Bosses after a $28.3 million opening weekend in July 2011, Bateman hasn't had this kind of luck with most of his starring roles. Universal's The Change-Up (with Ryan Reynolds) opened at $13.5 million in August 2011 and went on to gross only $37.1 million domestically, on a $52 million production budget. Jonathan Levine's Warm Bodies took second place for its second weekend with $11.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $36.7 million. This breaks Levine's record, beating the lifetime domestic gross of his last feature, the cancer dramedy 50/50 with Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which brought in $35 million. The R-rated Hitchcock-style, prescription-drug thriller Side Effects (CinemaScore: B) ended up beating director Steven Soderbergh's January 2012 weekend opening of Haywire, earning $10 million weekend this weekend and averaging $3,845 per theater. We talked a little bit about stars Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum's box office history yesterday. Another star of Side Effects is Jude Law, and he's got a varied track record at the box office. He generally participates in ensemble casts -- Anna Karenina, the Sherlock Holmes franchise, Soderbergh's Contagion, The Holiday -- making his singular box office appeal somewhat more elusive. Side Effects has Soderbergh's name and another strong ensemble, and could go on to a respectable run, even though it won't reach Contagion heights (the epidemic thriller eventually grossed $76 million). EW reviews: 'Identity Thief' Rounding out the top five are Silver Linings Playbook and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. The Academy Award-nominated Silver Linings Playbook is now at a cool $90 million domestically. The Weinstein Company's $21 million David O. Russell feature is steadily on its way to becoming a $100 million movie. This would be a first for Russell whose The Fighter came close with $93.6 million in domestic grosses. The $83 million Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters came in fifth place this weekend with $5.8 million, bumping its domestic total to $43.8 million. Notably, the Jeremy Renner vehicle is doing quite well overseas with $84 million. 1. Identity Thief -- $36.6 million . 2. Warm Bodies -- $11.5 million . 3. Side Effects -- $10 million . 4. Silver Linings Playbook -- $6.9 million . 5. Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters -- $5.8 million .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- In the end, the Braves are keeping with tradition - as in the signature 'A' that is the team's logo. MLB.com posted a photo of the new navy blue batting practice caps with a red and white scripted 'A.' The team will wear those hats at spring training, which starts Tuesday. The Braves said a decision on the batting caps had not been made yet when a potential design was leaked several weeks ago. That design drew ire for its ""screaming Indian"" logo. ""I like the selection we made this year,"" Braves President John Schuerholz said in a statement Monday. ""We had a variety of choices that we looked at, some more thoroughly than others. But at the end, we liked this one."" But writer Paul Lukas of ESPN's Uni Watch blog, who broke the news of the cap design in December, wasn't buying the Braves' statement. He suggested the Braves withdrew the design because of the furor it caused. ""In other words, the Braves are claiming that they were never committed to the Indian head cap to begin with,"" Lukas wrote. ""But that doesn't ring true. ""The Indian head cap has been shown for months in the official MLB Style Guide and is still shown there right now,"" Lukas wrote. ""It's also shown in the new New Era catalog. All signs indicate that the Braves fully intended to go with the Indian design until the recent controversy caused them to have second thoughts. Whew. That was certainly the reaction for some Americans, especially Native American groups that were highly critical of the screaming Indian logo. Kevin Gover, director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian, said in December that the use of the screaming Indian logo would be going backward. ""What this does is contribute to the casual racism native people are subjected to in our society,"" said Gover, a member of the Pawnee Nation. The screaming Indian is an image of an imaginary Indian, Gover said. It and other stereotypical sports mascots, he said, do not portray Native Americans for who they truly are. The Indian was part of the Braves logo when the team moved to Atlanta from Milwaukee in 1966. It was retired in 1989. The team also had a mascot, Chief Noc-a-Homa (knock a homer), who wore Native American dress and war paint. But not everyone agreed with the Braves' decision. @ADeVoll17 posted this: ""So disappointed the @Braves aren't wearing the Screaming Indian hats for spring training. You damn Indians won this time."" @MrBrohannon said: ""Sick and tired of this PC culture we live in where everybody is afraid to hurt anybody's feelings. The ""Screaming Indian"" logo isn't racist..."" Others just wanted a piece of the controversy: . @mattplanet said: ""Okay, so we all know some prototypes of that screaming indian Braves BP cap were made...somebody got to get us one..."" Debate over sports mascots is, of course, not new. U.S. professional and collegiate sports teams have used Native American logos and names for years. Baseball's Cleveland Indians, for instance, continue to feature a smiling Indian dubbed Chief Wahoo, criticized as a racist caricature. Sometimes this happens with the blessing of Native American tribes, and other times -- like with the NFL's Washington Redskins, a term that many feel advances a demeaning stereotype -- they have been denounced as racial slurs.","The Braves had reportedly considered using a 'screaming Indian' logo on batting practice caps .
The logo drew ire from Native Americans as being offensive .
The Braves are now using a navy blue cap with the scripted 'A' logo ."
"(Health.com) -- Intrauterine devices (IUDs) prevent unwanted pregnancies, and as an added benefit they may also help protect against cervical cancer, according to a new study in the Lancet Oncology, a British medical journal. Women who use IUDs are roughly half as likely to develop cervical cancer as women who have never used one, the study found. Nor does IUD use appear to increase the risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a known cause of cervical cancer. European researchers combined and analyzed data from nearly 20,000 women around the world who participated in various studies and surveys between 1985 and 2007. The new analysis does not prove that IUDs directly prevent cervical cancer; it simply suggests that the devices are associated with a lower risk of cancer for reasons that aren't fully understood. Health.com: Which birth control method is best for you? ""This study does not show cause and effect,"" says Mehdi Moslemi-Kebria, M.D., a gynecologic oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved in the new research. ""For that you would need a prospective, randomized study. But this does tell us with pretty good accuracy that an IUD is not a risk factor for cervical cancer."" Compared to women who had never used an IUD, the study participants who had used the devices had 44% lower odds of developing squamous cell carcinoma, by far the most common type of cervical cancer. They also had 54% lower odds of developing adenocarcinoma cancers and a mixed type of cancer known as adenosquamous carcinoma. Roughly 12,000 women in the U.S. -- the majority of them over 30 -- receive a cervical cancer diagnosis each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most cases are caused by a persistent infection with HPV, a common sexually transmitted virus that is usually defeated by the body's immune system. (Pap smears can tell if HPV is damaging the cervix.) Health.com: Top 10 myths about safe sex . In the study, which was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and several other government and philanthropic organizations, IUD use neither increased nor decreased the risk of HPV infection. The rates of infection were the same among women who had used an IUD as among those who hadn't, even after researchers took into account various risk factors for HPV, such as a woman's number of sexual partners, the number of Pap smears she'd had in her life, and her menopausal status. Although they have no firm evidence, the researchers speculate that the contraceptive devices may disrupt HPV's cancer-causing mechanism. The devices may cause a low-level immune-system response that fights cancer cells, for instance, or their insertion and withdrawal may physically remove precancerous lesions, the study notes. Health.com: 7 common birth control side effects . ""More research is definitely needed to study the biological mechanisms by which IUDs may induce this risk reduction,"" says the lead author of the study, Xavier CastellsaguÃ©, M.D., a cancer epidemiology researcher at the Institut CatalÃ  d'Oncologia, in Barcelona, Spain. Whatever the mechanism, it seems to work quickly. Women who used an IUD for less than a year were no more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer than women who'd had an IUD implanted for several years. There are two kinds of IUD available in the U.S., both of which are T-shaped and made from molded plastic. One uses copper as a contraceptive, and the other prevents pregnancy by releasing the hormone progestin into the uterus. Both are extremely effective forms of birth control, but because the study did not include data on the type of IUD used, the authors were unable to assess whether one type of IUD is more likely than another to lower the risk of cervical cancer. Health.com: Amazing moments in birth control . The new findings do not mean that women worried about cervical cancer should be fitted for an IUD, says Karl Ulrich Petry, M.D., a gynecologic oncologist at the Klinikum Wolfsburg, in Germany. Petry, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, points out that HPV testing and Pap smears already reduce the risk of cervical cancer by 80% to 90%. ""Women in countries with screening programs are well protected,"" he says. ""Cervical cancer is a preventable disease -- we have more tools to prevent this cancer than any other malignancy in humans. Women should really use [HPV] vaccine and screening to protect themselves from this cancer."" Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","Intrauterine devices (IUDs) prevent unwanted pregnancies .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Even the most banal question is met with an amusing and thought-provoking response from Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie, the two quipsters behind ""Flight of the Conchords."" Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie are a struggling musical duo in ""Flight of the Conchords."" ""What's your favorite color?"" went an innocuous query. ""Transparent,"" replied  Clement. ""Umm ... bluish-red,"" said McKenzie. Wait, isn't that ... purple? No matter. Absurd comedy comes as easily to the duo as useless advice flows from Murray, their always-dressed-in-brown band manager (played by Rhys Darby) on their hit HBO program. Five minutes in an elevator, a hallway, or an interview room with Clement and McKenzie, and a scene worthy of inclusion on the show effortlessly unfolds.  Watch the group talk about the price of fame » . Of course the native New Zealanders possess more smarts than their on-screen personas, two scrappy, clueless musicians trying -- and failing miserably -- to break into the music business in New York City. But the resemblance is as clear as the giant, idolizing blue eyes of their lone fan, Mel (Kristen Schaal). ""Most of the stories are based on things that happened to us,"" says McKenzie. ""We take one element, and then we kind of exaggerate it or twist it."" Consider the series' second episode of the new season (which started earlier this month), where Bret and Jemaine squabbled over Bret's ""extravagant"" purchase of a new coffee mug (it cost $2.79). Could a similar scenario have played out when the pair lived together as university students in their homeland more than 10 years ago? ""We were very poor,"" recalls Clement. ""Sometimes in our flat we would have so little money that we were trying to think of schemes, like how can we make some money today so that we can have some dinner."" With the economy taking a turn for the worst in recent months, ""Flight of the Conchords"" now seems more relevant. ""We basically never set out to have the show be a credit crunch show,"" says co-executive producer and co-creator James Bobin. ""But it seems the world has caught up with us."" And CNN caught up with Clement and McKenzie (Bobin, too) to talk about writing silly songs, the sweet tooth of success and to find out why Aussies -- such as CNN's interviewer -- are always in the cross hairs. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: The show is a big hit around the world. Do you consider yourselves worthy cultural ambassadors for New Zealand? Jemaine Clement: I think in some ways our characters are typical of New Zealanders. New Zealand has a reputation as being one of the most boring peoples of the world. You don't know of that? CNN: I wouldn't agree with that. Bret McKenzie: Friendly. I think they're famous for being friendly. Clement: Well, I've heard boring. CNN: As an Australian, I would like to know why you make fun of Australians so much. McKenzie: Because we find them funny. Clement: We've toured in Australia and ... it always struck me when we went out to lunch with people how many times we would be made fun of because of our accents. So we stored up all that resentment and we waited years ... McKenzie: And unleashed it. Clement: We're giving it back to the Australians who made fun of us. CNN: James, what is it like to work with these two? James Bobin: It's a pleasure, obviously. We've been friends for years now. ... The show's incredibly hard work because obviously we do music and comedy at the same time and that's quite a challenge. But they're both very hardworking so it makes it easy. CNN: What's it like on set? I imagine when the cameras start rolling that a lot of what happens is improvised. Bobin: To a certain degree, yeah. We have a script that we like ... so we obviously try to nail that first. And from that position we just play with it a little bit and see where we go. Especially with Rhys, because Rhys is such a brilliant improviser and these guys and Rhys do so well together in those scenes in the band meetings. Often they go way off script. Clement: Yeah, we try and write the script with parts that we know we can improvise off. So we leave some things open-ended. McKenzie: It's between 17 and 18 percent improvised. Clement: But this interview is a hundred percent. CNN: A lot of the musical numbers from the first season you had in stock before you even made the TV show ... Clement: The songs in the second season are not worse than the songs in the first season. CNN: That wasn't going to be my question! How challenging was it to come up with a whole new set of songs? Clement: Well, I think that was the fun part of the show because playing music is fun. Bobin: Also, we had some stories in mind so this time round we could write songs to fit with the stories -- which was kind of nice because last year it was a bit harder to squeeze the songs into a storyline. It just made for very strange situations. Clement: Yeah, and having the songs in the beginning sometimes leads to boring storylines because all the songs are about girls. So when we have a whole lot of storylines about girls our episodes have to be about girls. So we could go off that a bit this time. CNN: How confident are you both in your abilities as musicians? McKenzie: 24 to 27 percent. Clement: I'm 24. He's 27. McKenzie: Combined we're mediocre. CNN: How are you enjoying the fame that's come from the success? McKenzie: Oh it's lovely. You get free desserts. CNN: Just free desserts? McKenzie: Free drinks. Sometimes some free shoes. Clement: Sometimes people invade your privacy. McKenzie: Strangers talk to you. Clement: But balanced against the free desserts, it evens out. CNN: Have you encountered any Mel-like fans? McKenzie: A lot of fans like to come up and say they're the real Mel. Or ""you've actually got two fans."" CNN: Did you know someone who was like Murray? Is he based on a friend or a stereotype? Clement: In some ways, our real manager in New Zealand. McKenzie: She's very maternal. I think Murray's quite a maternal figure. Clement: She gives us lists that are overly detailed. And when we were going to a new country she'd be very worried for our safety. Not that long ago Tenacious D [Jack Black's band] came to New Zealand and we were asked to open for them, and she didn't know who they were, even though they're the biggest musical comedy act ever. And that carries through to Murray. CNN: How surprised were you by the success of the show? McKenzie: I'm surprised by the diversity of the fans. Like there are people who are our age, which makes sense, and then there are people in their 70s who love the show. And then there are children who love the show. There's a scene in the show where I watch television in a box. I get a box sent over from New Zealand. And my friend's son, he watches TV sitting in a box. And he's 9. It's great.

"(CNN) -- Luiz Felipe Scolari's mission to lead Brazil to World Cup glory on home soil suffered an inauspicious start as his team suffered its first defeat by England for 23 years. Scolari, who replaced Mano Menezes at the helm in November for a second spell in charge, looked on from the touchline as goals from Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard gave England a 2-1 victory Wednesday. Ronaldinho's return to the team after a one year absence ended in disappointment after his penalty was saved by England goalkeeper Joe Hart. Scolari ""obliged"" to win World Cup . The 32-year-old lasted just 45 minutes, but former Chelsea manager Scolari says the playmaker will be given another chance to prove his worth following an unimpressive showing. ""He has played 90 minutes for the first time this year last week, so it's to be expected that he is not fully in the conditions that he wants,"" Scolari told reporters. ""It was established that Neymar would take the penalties but he was changing his shin pad, or something like that. ""Ronaldinho took the ball and nobody is going to ask a player of that experience and with that caliber to back down and let somebody else take it."" England had taken the lead just minutes after Ronaldinho's failure from the spot when Rooney lashed home following good work from Theo Walcott. Brazil drew level after the interval when a mistake by Chelsea's Gary Cahill allowed substitute Fred to rifle home an equalizer from just inside the penalty area. But Lampard, who came on at half-time, fired home the winner when his effort flew off Julio Cesar's post and into the net. England manager Roy Hodgson told BBC radio: ""It's my first crack at Brazil as a manager and I'm delighted to have been able to oversee a victory. ""It was an all-round performance from the team, there were some very, very good moments and I thought we were good value for two goals to one."" Top five signings of the transfer window? Elsewhere, World and European champions Spain extended its unbeaten run to 17 games with a 3-1 win over Uruguay in Qatar. Barcelona's Pedro Rodriguez scored twice and Cesc Fabregas was also on target for Spain with Cristian Rodgriuez netting for Uruguay. The contest also saw Barcelona's Carles Puyol captain the side on the occasion his 100th international appearance. ""Pedro is a dynamic player,"" Spain coach Vicente del Bosque told reporters. ""He knows exactly what he has to do and he has the touch of speed needed in modern football. ""We had periods of good football in the first-half but we lacked a bit of directness and Pedro provided this with his speed."" Spain make compelling case as best team ever . Italy needed a last gasp strike from Marco Verratti to secure a 1-1 draw in Holland. The home side looked set for victory thanks to Jeremain Lens' 33rd minute strike, but Italy hit back to salvage a draw. Germany came from behind to defeat France 2-1 in Paris thanks to goals from Thomas Muller and Sami Khedira. It was the first time since 1987 that the Germans have beaten France, which had taken a first half lead through Mathieu Valbuena. ""We played some good stuff going forward, but were punished for our mistakes, especially at their equalizer,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told reporters. ""We kept pushing right to the end, but unfortunately it wasn't to be."" Ronaldo admits Real's Champions League 'anxiety' Cristiano Ronaldo was on target for Portugal, but the Real Madrid star couldn't prevent his side from losing 3-2 at home to Ecuador. Portugal had led 2-1 after Ronaldo and Helder Postiga had overturned Antonio Valencia's second minute strike. But an own-goal from Joao Pereira and a Felipe Caicedo effort sealed a surprise win for the South Americans. Messi and Balotelli spot on . Leo Messi failed to score as Argentina claimed a 3-2 win over Sweden in Stockholm. An own-goal by Mikael Lustig gave Argentina the lead before Jonas Olsson equalized in the 18th minute. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero restored his side's lead 60 seconds later with Gonazlo Higuain adding a third soon after. Rasmus Elm's 90th minute strike proved a mere consolation for the home side. Elsewhere, Belgium defeated Slovakia 2-1, Russia won 2-0 in Iceland, Croatia defeated South Korea 4-0 and Romania overcame Australia 3-2.","England defeats Brazil 2-1 in Luiz Felipe Scolari's first game back in charge .

"(CNN) -- Gov. Chris Christie, we watched as you lashed out at former White House physician Dr. Connie Mariano this week for calling you out about your weight during a recent CNN report. It's none of her business, you proclaimed. She's just a ""hack,"" you offered. She needs to just ""shut up,"" you said. Governor, you might not want to dismiss her so quickly. Yes, she has never examined you and maybe it's not her job to be pointing out the obvious: that morbidly obese men have a significantly higher chance of dying early than the population at large. But, still, she was probably doing you a favor. How do I know? Seven years ago, governor, I was you. Sure, I wasn't the popular chief executive of a major state and a leading Republican possibility for president. But, back then, I was busy, with a pretty full life in my own right. In 2006, I was a corporate executive of a major media company. I had just helped lead the team in Biloxi, Mississippi, covering Hurricane Katrina, an effort that led to The Sun Herald winning the Pulitzer Prize for public service. I was the president of the National Association of Black Journalists, the largest journalism organization of people of color in America. And, at 6 feet 4 inches tall and 441 pounds, I was morbidly obese. I'm not going to get into your specific health situation -- you said your numbers are ""great"" and you were the ""healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life"" -- and no lay person can speak confidently about the state of another person's health. All I can say is that I and thousands of other morbidly obese men in their 30s and 40s have uttered exactly the same words. Almost verbatim. We feel great. We have plenty of energy. Low cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure. Blah, blah, blah. Then, I ended up in intensive care, on the edge of a coma. Nearly a decade ago, after having received a pretty decent physical a few months earlier, I was in Washington for a conference. One morning, I was unusually thirsty, lethargic and tired, and ended up being rushed to the emergency room at the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington. Ketoacidosis, the doctors said. Significantly elevated blood sugar levels, too much for the body to process. Not good. Bryan, they told me, you were in serious trouble. And that got my attention. Governor, like you, I have kids whom I cherish -- they were 5 and 4 at the time. They are my life. But the doctors told me if I kept going down the path I was headed, I would likely not be around to watch them graduate from high school. I certainly did not like hearing that -- thought they were being rude and overly blunt -- but I knew the doctors were right. Opinion: What you thought you knew about obesity is wrong . So, in 2006, I made a pretty major decision to have gastric bypass surgery. And I believe it saved my life. Since then, I have lost more than 170 pounds. Now, I'm not Barack Obama-skinny -- I still need to drop another 30 or 40 more to hit my goal -- but I am much happier and healthier. And I can now hang with my 11-year-old son on the basketball court. My decision, like yours, was deeply personal. But I'm also a reporter. I did my research. I knew that obesity was the single biggest health risk in this country, and that more than one of every three Americans are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For African Americans, obesity is the largest contributor to deadly complications -- hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, amputation, blindness -- that our community has ever known. I knew that the most morbidly obese men who were successful enough to lose 100 pounds or more tended to gain all of it back -- plus another 20% more -- within five years. It wasn't that they were lazy or bad or undisciplined. It was just plain, biological facts. So, at seven years out, I feel lucky. Now, I am not about to proselytize about such a dramatic move. While techniques have improved considerably in the past 20 years, the bariatric option is still a major procedure in which as many as two out of every 100 patients die on the operating table or soon after the surgery. It's still a big deal. If I could have been successful with more traditional means, I would have been happy. I had tried everything -- the South Beach diet, the all-juice diet -- and spent more money on gyms, trainers and treadmills than my accountant would approve. But, after a lifetime of fooling myself about this plan or that diet -- I could easily lose 30-40 pounds at a time, only to have it creep back -- I had to make a tough choice. At the end of the day, each obese person needs to choose his or her own path to get down to a more reasonable and healthier weight. But the alternative, doing nothing, is a recipe for disaster. (How many morbidly obese people in their 80s have you seen lately?) For me, it wasn't a cosmetic or vanity thing. It was a choice I made so I'd be around to walk my daughter down the aisle or see my son win the Heisman trophy. Gov. Christie, you talked about being angry that your kids were watching TV when the doctor said she was concerned you'd die in office. Let me tell you something: It's much better that they hear that and then have you around to explain it to them than have to experience the scary alternative. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bryan Monroe.","Gov. Chris Christie says a doctor who commented on his weight should ""shut up""

"(Travel + Leisure) -- The English call them bolt-holes: intimate, personalized spaces to escape the madding crowd, filled with thought-provoking art and stylish accessories. A place to put your feet up and feel at home, plan the next foray to galleries and greenswards, or merely contemplate the approach of cocktail hour. Europeans, of course, have always had a way with chic, small-scale hotels. Here are 10 of the top newcomers, all with fewer than 15 rooms -- and many under $250 a night. Tenbosch House, Belgium . The two attached town houses that make up Tenbosch House (doubles from $310) contain seven uncluttered suites in the heart of Brussels's of-the-moment Ixelles neighborhood. The hotel showcases contemporary furnishings -- such as Tom Dixon's copper bubble lamps -- and a rotating collection of art curated by top local galleries. 40 Winks, England . Near hip Shoreditch, 40 Winks (doubles from $200) is a darling of the theater and fashion crowd, including actress Kristin Scott Thomas; Dolce & Gabbana often uses the 18th-century town house turned design studio as a set for photo shoots. Above the public salons and a postage-stamp garden, the two bedrooms are filled with vintage discoveries from Portobello Road and Paris's Clignancourt market.

The Lake District has always been inspiration for painters and poets, so pack watercolors and journals for a stay at the Boathouse at Knotts End (doubles from $463), a 19th-century stone cottage on the water's edge in scenic Cumbria. It has slate-and-oak interiors, with a single cozy bedroom, a lounge with a leather sofa, and a kitchen for preparing tea and biscuits. In the slip below, a boat awaits for rowing on the private lake. Hôtel Ville d'Hiver, France . Hôtel Ville d'Hiver (doubles from $244), in a quiet seaside town southwest of Bordeaux, takes liquid refreshment seriously. This former bottling plant has a classic bistro with an extensive wine list from the region's best vineyards -- including 30 organic vintages. The 12 guest rooms are furnished with Napoleon-era antiques and modern steel-and-bamboo campaign beds. Babuino 181, Italy . Sepia-toned photographic murals of iconic Roman monuments set the tone in the 14 rooms at Babuino 181 (doubles from $417). This palazzo near the Spanish Steps retains original details -- a cast-iron railing and Italian marble staircase -- and, come this spring, will have a marvelous rooftop bar for aperitivos. Babuino is also a block from Via Margutta, a cul-de-sac lined with some of the Eternal City's best galleries and design shops. Travel + Leisure: Europe's best Christmas markets . Aranjaya, Italy .

Suspended in the trees of a forest in northern Sweden, 37 miles from the Arctic Circle, the five conceptual retreats resemble, respectively, a cubic cabin, a flying saucer, a bird's nest, a Modernist pinecone, and a mirrored box. Footbridges and viewing platforms above the Lule River valley allow guests to commune with nature. Even the birch sauna seems to float in midair. Vorstadt 14, Switzerland . Part of the RoughLuxe collection, Vorstadt 14 (doubles from $490) is an art experiment from top to bottom. The ground floor of this updated 15th-century house near Zurich is occupied by Face, a postmodern gallery, while the remaining three floors -- called Brain and Soul -- contain a suite and a private apartment with an open fireplace and platform bed.

"(CNN) -- Dee Stewart's birthday is Friday, and she'll be wearing red to celebrate. It's not her favorite color, but it is for her favorite cause. Friday is National Wear Red Day, part of the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women movement to raise awareness about women's heart health. Stewart is a survivor of heart failure. Stewart's life changed in 2000 when she remained hospitalized for fatigue, nausea and other unexplained symptoms after her daughter's birth. ""They couldn't figure out what was wrong with me,"" said Stewart of Covington, Georgia. ""By the time they figured it out, my heart function had gone to 5%, and I was on the heart transplant list."" Stewart was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy, a rare heart disorder that affects women from the final month of pregnancy to five months after childbirth. She had never heard of the condition before and had no history of heart disease in her family, or so she thought. ""Once I became sick, we had to dig into our family history to find out was it hereditary,"" Stewart said. ""I've had relatives that have died from it."" After her diagnosis, volunteers from the American Heart Association helped teach Stewart about her illness and how to manage its symptoms. Her heart function has improved to around 40%, and by making lifestyle changes, she is able to lead a mostly normal life. During her recovery, Stewart realized how important it was to educate herself and other women about the risk factors and warning signs of heart disease. ""We like to take care of the family and everyone else first. We have to go to the doctor first. The family cannot boil water if you're sick,"" she said. ""The more education we know about these things the better we can react for our families."" For 10 years, Stewart has dedicated her birthday to teaching other women about heart health and raising money for Go Red for Women. ""Every year that I'm alive I want to remember. I want to educate women on the Go Red campaign and American Heart (Association) because they really did save me,"" Stewart said. According to the association, cardiovascular disease claims the lives of 500,000 women each, yet like Stewart initially, a large percentage of women are unaware of its dangers. ""I think that women commonly think of heart disease as a man's disease, which it is not. Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women,"" said Dr. Mary Ann Bauman, medical director for women's health and community relations at INTEGRIS Health in Oklahoma City and also a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women movement. ""This grass-roots movement has made a difference,"" Bauman said. ""Research shows that women (who) have visited (the Go Red for Women) website, more than a third of them have lost weight; 40% have checked their cholesterol; a third of them have talked to their doctors."" Go Red for Women is trying to raise $100,000 by the end of February in honor of National Heart Month to fund additional research and education programs on women's heart health. This year Stewart will don her red and gather with friends, family and other women at a suburban Atlanta restaurant to celebrate her 39th birthday, raise money for the association and teach women to take charge of their health. ""It can happen to anybody. I don't want women to wait,"" Stewart said. ""You only get this heart once. Be forceful about your health."" She plans to pass out small red dress pins, a symbol of Go Red for Women's fight for awareness. ""For me it symbolizes that there is an importance placed on women's health. It also seems like a sisterhood when I see people with the red pins on,"" Stewart said. She said hopes the pins are a reminder that heart disease can be treated and even prevented, but first you have to be informed. For information on the American Heart Association, visit its website.

"(CNN) -- At least 10 people drowned in the Mediterranean when a ship sank between Libya and the Italian island of Lampedusa Sunday, according to Italy's official news agency. Seventy people, including 62 men and eight women, were rescued, ANSA reported. One of the women is pregnant, it said. The search by Italy's Navy and Coast Guard is underway for any other survivors, but the report did not say how many people were still missing. The report referred to the ship's passengers as migrants, suggesting they are from North Africa. A boat carrying about 100 migrants from Tunisia ran into trouble in the same area two months ago, triggering a rescue effort by the Italians and NATO ships. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter European Union countries. Boats carrying migrants often are in peril at sea. Amnesty International reported at least 1,500 deaths last year of people attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea. The human rights monitoring group said some of the deaths could have been prevented. ""The desire of some European countries to prevent irregular migration (people who do not have permission to live and work in these countries) has undermined safe and timely rescue at sea,"" Amnesty International said.","Seventy people, including 62 men and eight women, were rescued, ANSA reports .

"Washington (CNN) -- On Tuesday, President Barack Obama will present his fourth State of the Union address, the 224th in the nation's history. However, this will be only the 80th time a president has delivered the speech before Congress -- earlier presidents routinely delivered a written message to be read to Congress. Here are some firsts from past State of the Union addresses: . First African-American: Obama is the only African-American to have addressed a joint session or joint meeting of Congress. Over the years, several black speakers from other countries have addressed a joint meeting of Congress. Notable examples are Nelson Mandela in 1990 and 1994 and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in 2006. By the Numbers: State of the Union . Records: Although Woodrow Wilson holds the record for most speeches delivered before Congress with 26, Franklin Roosevelt holds the record for the most State of the Union/annual message addresses with 12. Ten were in person, and two were in writing -- one of those he read over the radio from the White House as a ""fireside chat."" Speechless: Two presidents never prepared any type of State of the Union or annual message: William Henry Harrison and James Garfield. Harrison died after only 32 days in office; Garfield after only 199 days. On the radio: The first of the annual messages broadcast nationally on radio was Calvin Coolidge's speech on December 6, 1923. A year earlier, Warren Harding's annual message was broadcast on radio to a very limited audience, including the first lady, who listened from the White House while recovering from an illness. John King: Why State of the Union might do little to fix divided Washington . On TV: The first televised State of the Union was delivered by Harry Truman on January 6, 1947. Prime time: The first prime-time State of the Union was delivered on January 4, 1965, when Lyndon Johnson moved the speech from its traditional midday time slot to the evening to attract a larger television audience. Online: The first State of the Union to be webcast live on the Internet was George W. Bush's 2002 address. High-def: The first high-definition TV State of the Union broadcast was Bush's 2004 address. 8 memorable State of the Union moments . Postponed: The first and only postponement of a State of the Union occurred in 1986. Ronald Reagan was scheduled to deliver his address on January 28, 1986 -- the same day the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded. Reagan instead addressed the nation from the Oval Office that night on the tragedy and the State of the Union was delayed a week. The longest: Bill Clinton's 2000 address, which clocked in at 1 hour, 28 minutes and 49 seconds, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Written annual messages were usually very long, with Jimmy Carter, William Howard Taft and Truman submitting the longest. The shortest: George Washington's 1790 address was only 833 words and is believed to have lasted less than 10 minutes. Highlights from past addresses .","Obama is only African-American to address joint session or joint meeting of Congress .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will deliver his fourth State of the Union address on Tuesday, marking his seventh address to a joint session of Congress. Here are some highlights from past State of the Union addresses: . 2012: Obama calls for lower corporate taxes and incentives to U.S. manufacturers to bring overseas jobs back to the U.S. He challenges Congress to act on comprehensive immigration reform and passage of the DREAM Act. He announces he would open up 75% of potential offshore oil and gas resources. He repeated his longstanding call for the wealthy to pay more in taxes, including a specific proposal for millionaires to have a tax rate of 30%. The speech was attended by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was recovering from a gunshot wound. 2011: Obama calls for unity in his first State of the Union after Democrats lost control of the House in the previous year's midterm elections. Although Rep. Paul Ryan gives the official Republican response, Rep. Michele Bachmann delivers a tea party response. 2010: Obama criticizes the Supreme Court for a recent campaign finance ruling that he said ""will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections."" Justice Samuel Alito is seen on camera shaking his head at the comment and saying, ""Not true."" By the numbers: State of the Union . 2009: Obama says he aims to halve the deficit by the end of his first term. He focuses on energy, health care and education. In a lighter moment, Obama announces that Vice President Joe Biden would head a ""tough, unprecedented oversight effort"" over the fiscal stimulus plan, ""because nobody messes with Joe."" 2008: President George W. Bush uses his final State of the Union address to call for a quick shot in the arm for the economy in ""a period of uncertainty"" and touts progress in the war in Iraq. The speech is in large part overshadowed by the presidential race, coming just eight days before the Super Tuesday primaries. Democratic presidential hopefuls Obama and Hillary Clinton attend the speech; Republican candidate John McCain does not. Bush's approval rating is in the low 30s. 2007: Bush addresses a joint session of Congress for the first time in which Democrats control both chambers, having won them in the previous year's midterm elections. Bush begins his speech by congratulating the first ""Madam Speaker"" of the House, Nancy Pelosi. He calls on Congress to ""work together"" on a variety of fronts -- including balancing the budget and reforming Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. He also appeals for patience with his recently announced plan to increase troop levels in Iraq, despite opposition from many Democrats and some members of his own party. Bush also puts forth a wish list to extend health insurance coverage, reduce gasoline consumption by 20% over 10 years, limit greenhouse gas emissions and create a temporary worker program to address illegal immigration. The president addresses Iraq largely in the framework of a ""broader struggle"" against terrorism, evoking the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks several times. 8 memorable State of the Union moments . 2006: Bush declares that ""America is addicted to oil"" and proposes increased funding and research for alternative energy sources. On the Iraq War, he says that the U.S. is ""on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory"" and rejects calls for withdrawing troops. He also renews his call for a guest worker program for immigrants, defends the NSA warrantless surveillance program, urges Congress to make his first-term tax cut laws permanent and asks for line-item veto power. Bush also pays tribute to Coretta Scott King, who had died the night before. Two women are ejected from the chamber before the speech begins. Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan is removed -- and subsequently arrested -- for wearing a T-shirt that reads ""2,245 Dead. How many more?"" The wife of Rep. Bill Young, R-Florida, is ejected for wearing a shirt that reads, ""Support the Troops."" The Capitol Police later say the two women should not have been removed from the chamber and issues apologies to both. 2005: Bush lays out his second-term agenda and calls for the creation of ""voluntary personal retirement accounts"" as part of his Social Security plan. He ticks through a number of proposals including some proposed by Democrats, saying ""all these ideas are on the table."" He also hails the successful Iraqi elections. Many members of Congress have their fingers dipped in ink in support of Iraqi voters who went to the polls despite the threat of violence. The president also introduces Safia Taleb al-Suhail, an Iraqi human rights advocate who had voted in the recent Iraqi elections. As lawmakers stand and cheer, al-Suhail, holding back tears, flashes a victory sign and shows her voting finger. Bush later introduces Janet and Bill Norwood, whose son Byron, a Marine sergeant, was killed in Iraq. Janet Norwood and al-Suhail embrace, an emotional scene that draws a long round of applause from the audience. 2004: Bush makes what many call a veiled reference to the 2004 presidential race the day after Democratic Sen. John Kerry's victory in the Iowa caucuses: ""We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face a choice: We can go forward with confidence and resolve, or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us. We can press on with economic growth, and reforms in education and Medicare, or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions."" 2003: Bush utters the so-called ""16 words"" to help justify military action against Iraq: ""The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa."" The White House eventually admits that the claim was based on faulty data but maintains that the president was unaware of this at the time the speech is delivered. Who was invited: Past presidential guests at State of the Union . 2002: Bush calls Iran, Iraq and North Korea the ""axis of evil."" 1999: President Bill Clinton delivers his penultimate State of the Union shortly after having been impeached by the House of Representatives and while on trial in the Senate over the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 1998: Clinton delivers the State of the Union days after the Lewinsky scandal breaks. After wide speculation, Clinton chooses not to address the matter. 1997: The O.J. Simpson civil trial verdict is announced the same night as the State of the Union. Many broadcasts use a split screen to show both the announcement of the verdicts and the Republican response by Rep. J.C. Watts. 1996: Clinton declares that ""the era of big government is over."" 1992: By the time of the January State of the Union, President George H. W. Bush's approval rating has fallen to 46% from its Gulf War high of 89%, the lowest approval rating of his presidency at that point. It would eventually dip into the low 30s before his term ends. 1991: Bush delivers his State of the Union just 13 days after attacks on Iraq begin on January 16. Security is especially tight as Bush lays out the rationale for military action. He says Americans had a ""unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom."" He goes on to say, ""What is at stake is more than one small country; it is a big idea: a new world order. Our cause is just. Our cause is moral. Our cause is right."" He draws the longest standing ovation when he says of U.S. service men and women in the Persian Gulf, ""There is no one more devoted, more committed to the hard work of freedom."" A Gallup poll taken shortly after the speech has Bush's approval rating at 82%. 1988: President Ronald Reagan criticizes Congress for passing last-minute, catch-all spending bills, and as a visual aid, hoists 3,296 pages of budget legislation documents weighing 43 pounds onto his podium. 1986: Reagan had planned to mention teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe during his address, but the speech is postponed when the Space Shuttle Challenger explodes after launch that morning, killing McAuliffe and six others. State of the Union firsts . 1974: President Richard Nixon calls for an end to the Watergate investigation, saying, ""One year of Watergate is enough."" He also declares he will not resign from office, saying, ""I have no intention whatever of ever walking away from the job that the people elected me to do."" He resigns six months later. 1965: President Lyndon Johnson announces his Great Society programs. He also calls for a Voting Rights Act as well as air and water purification. The audience applauds 80 times during the address. This is the first State of the Union address to be broadcast on prime-time TV. 1964: Johnson pledges to continue much of the work begun by President John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated two months before. Johnson warns the Soviet Union that the U.S. remains a worthy adversary. ""We intend to bury no one, and we do not intend to be buried,"" he says, referring to a statement by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. Although Johnson's speech is relatively brief (3,059 words), it took 24 writers six weeks and 10 to 16 major revisions to craft the final version. 1944: Ill after an overseas trip, President Franklin Roosevelt delivers his State of the Union as a ""fireside chat"" on the radio instead of before a joint session of Congress. 1941: Roosevelt speaks about the ""Four Freedoms"": Freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. He warns of a ""foreign peril"" in Europe and urges support for England against Germany. 1862: With the Civil War not yet a year old, President Abraham Lincoln calls for the emancipation of the slaves. 1823: President James Monroe discusses the centerpiece of his foreign policy, now known as the Monroe Doctrine, which calls on European countries to end Western colonization.","Obama called for unity in 2011 after Democrats lost the House the year before .

"(CNN) -- The waves up to 30 feet high that climbed over houses thankfully are now a memory, as are related floodwaters that covered one quarter of one seaside Massachusetts town. Some streets that had been littered with trees and about 2 feet of snow are finally passable. And by late Monday morning, temperatures should rise well above freezing, perhaps accompanied by rain. That's the good news. But it's still hard for scores of people still in shelters, and for many more huddling for heat overnight, to celebrate. ""It looked like a war zone,"" said Jim Cantwell, a state representative for the Bay State towns of Marshfield and Scituate, where about 90% of customers remained without power late Sunday. ""The devastation we have seen here would lead one to believe that it'll be days before we get power back."" The blizzard that struck the Northeast starting Friday was historic by many measures -- most of all, by the amount of snow that fell. Hamden, Connecticut, for instance received a whopping 40 inches, making it difficult for even plows to get out on the roads -- with CNN iReporter Mia Orsatti saying streets there had transformed into ""white, wide, soft blanket(s) of snow."" Tornado strikes in the Deep South . The tally in Hamden was the most recorded by the National Weather Service in any community, but even lesser amounts led to major headaches, especially when combined with, at times, hurricane-force wind gusts, powerful storm surges and snow drifts that buried cars and most everything else. ""There's a ton of snow, and there's nowhere to put it,"" said Lena Berc of Boston, where 24.9 inches fell. ""So it's really frustrating to find nooks and crannies."" Nine people were killed in accidents related to the storm, including five in Connecticut, two in Ontario, Canada, one in New York and one in Massachusetts. A 14-year-old Boston boy who hopped in a snowed-in family car to get a break from shoveling ended up suffering carbon monoxide poisoning. About 270,000 utility customers remained in the dark late Sunday afternoon, a significant improvement from the 635,000 without electricity about 24 hours earlier. These outages were the result of a combination of whipping winds and power poles and lines sagging, and sometimes snapped, under the weight of especially heavy, wet snow and ice. The storm by the numbers . ""There was a phenomenal amount of trees that went down,"" Cantwell said, noting that 100% of Scituate residents had no power Sunday morning and estimating it may be Thursday before all the lights are back on. About 200 people were in shelters Sunday in southeastern Connecticut, Gov. Dannel Malloy said. And more than that number found refuge at schools-turned-shelters on the South Shore of Massachusetts, where dozens of National Guardsmen were on the ground to help local authorities and residents deal with flooding and storm damage there. The forecast for the days ahead in the hardest-hit areas seems mostly a blessing, though there's a chance of a curse. Daytime temperatures should climb into the 40s Monday in much of southern Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where rain may fall as well. That may help melt some snow, though it could make what's there even heavier and increase the risk of roof collapses and more. Malloy said Sunday that there are reports of a barn, sports facility, commercial building and more caving in. The mix of snow and rain will also contribute to a messy Monday morning commute into cities like Boston, though schools will remain closed there and many other locales as the snow clean-up effort continues. There have been notable signs of progress, at least. Flights resumed at Boston's Logan Airport on Sunday, for instance, and Amtrak resumed limited service as part of its general ramp-up. ""We're working as hard as we can,"" Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee said of efforts in his state, a sentiment echoed elsewhere. ""We're seeing efforts every hour."" Snow woes were hardly confined to the Northeast. Troubles is also brewing for northern Midwest states, where a major winter storm will bring heavy snow and strong winds from northeast Colorado to central Minnesota from Sunday into Monday, the National Weather Service said. Eastern South Dakota could see more than a foot of snow and 50 mph winds, ""creating whiteout conditions,"" the weather agency said. For all the headaches in New England, meanwhile, there was also many enjoying the wintry conditions. iReporter Filipe Pereira said students Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston, who were set to return to class Monday, had enjoyed the weekend storm, engaging in massive snowball fights and building snowmen everywhere. People were even skiing down one street, he said, where students earlier took a series of photographs tracking the storm over 26 hours. The streets around the small school were still a mess, but they were no longer closed. ""People have been going all over the roads with no problem,"" he said. Map, time line of the storm . CNN's Holly Yan, Mary Snow, Chris Welch, Brian Rokus, Jill Martin, AnneClaire Stapleton, Pauline Kim, Erinn Cawthon, Chris Boyette and Christi Wolf contributed to this report.","NEW: 90% of two Massachusetts towns still don't have power, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Why did Eric Hobsbawm, one of the greatest historians of modern times, remain a Marxist after the end of the Soviet Union, and defend communism into the 21st century? To be a man of Hobsbawm's generation was to have experienced the collapse of capitalism in the Great Depression, to be a Jew of Hobsbawm's generation was to have seen the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany. In those years of the 1930s, the years when Hobsbawm was a brilliant youth, was to face what seemed to be a binary choice, to be with the Nazis or against them. And no one seemed to be more against the Nazis than the communists. Hobsbawm joined the Communist Party as a very young man, and was loyal, in his way, to the end. Communism also offered, as perhaps no non-religious ideas do today, a sense of community. To belong to the Communist Party was to have a sense of conspiracy, a loyalty to friends who had suffered and would suffer more, and a collective sense that the struggle was not in vain, for a more glorious world could and would come. Like religion for Americans, who repeat that ""things happen for a reason,"" communism offered a logic of pain and progress. Every arrest, every sentence to a concentration camp, every execution was not just a moment of horror, but further proof of capitalism's decadence and weakness. The story was that communism could consolidate a generation because it transcended any generation. The motor of history was changes in means of production. As the basic structure of the economy changed, the traditional feudal order in the countryside gave way to capitalism in the cities. Once industry was built and working classes become massive, the people would claim the fruits of their own labor, and the factories and the cities would be shared by all. Private property took the place of original sin: with the revolution, that stain would be removed, and we would return to our original nature, and we would be good and peaceful as well as prosperous. The story had a logic, but it also required an element of faith. The faith and the logic had to work together, and in a mind such as Hobsbawm's, one of the great minds of the 20th century, logic could keep faith in the shadows. But it was always present, and perhaps in the end it was dominant. Communists could be great historians (fascists could not), because communism provides history with a plot. But because communism in the 20th century was not just an idea but a political reality, its story slowly transformed from one of prophecy to one of retrospective editing. The Soviet Union, to borrow Brezhnev's term, ""really existed,"" and its policies of mass killing were widely known: the deliberate starvation of millions of Ukrainians in 1933, the mass shootings of peasants and ethnic minorities in 1937 and 1938, the alliance with Nazi Germany in 1939, the executions of Polish prisoners of war in 1940, the postwar domination of eastern Europe, the crushing of reform movements in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and all the rest. In Hobsbawm's extraordinary history of the modern world, the last part is the weakest, in part because he must face this problem of a Soviet Union that itself poses a problem for a communist scheme of history. It did not bring what communism promised, and then it came to an end. But the idea that history is a grand story with a wonderful conclusion did not. Over the course of the Cold War, we in the West, and especially in America, came to think of history as having a plot, just one which happened to be the reverse of the communist one. Private property must stay, not be abolished. The state must shrink, not grow. The rich are not villains, but heroes. Capitalism does not bring its own collapse, but expanding stability. If we followed these simple prescriptions, then a utopia would await us as well. The end of the Soviet Union was understood by many of us not as an end to ideology, but as proof that our ideology was the better one. Just why Eric Hobsbawm thought as he did, wrote as he did, and lived as he did is a matter that is beyond the judgement of any one of his colleagues, and there are people far better equipped than I to judge. But I would like to advance one simple thought. Eric was certainly loyal to the memory of old comrades, and he was certainly sentimental about his own youthful past. In his old age, I suppose without any kind of certainty, he found himself in a historical moment, our own, which still seemed like an age of ideology, with his own ideology in the weaker position. And he was a fighter. As he edited the past according to his own ideology, warping history in a way that can only be troubling, he was defending a Soviet state that no longer existed, and ideas which seemed dead. But wrong as it was, it did embody certain virtues. There is something to be said, after all, for defending the weak, even today, especially today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Snyder.","Historian Eric Hobsbawm stayed loyal to Marxism until his death at 95 .

"(CNN) -- Aksel Lund Svindal thanked his injured teammate after reclaiming his downhill title and making history at the Alpine Skiing World Championships in Austria on Saturday. Svindal is the only Norwegian male still competing at Schladming after Kjetil Jansrud was ruled out for the rest of this season when he suffered a serious knee injury in Wednesday's super-G event. Svindal was disappointed to finish with bronze in that race, won by American Ted Ligety, but bounced back to become the first man to take golds in four consecutive world championships as he won back the title he claimed in 2007. ""Crossing the finish line, looking up to see your name at the top of the leaderboard in a finish area with 40,000 spectators. What a day!"" the 30-year-old wrote on his blog afterwards. ""The course was super tough. Pushing my limits the whole way down. I was more mentally than physically tired at the end. Thanks for all the support. I felt like the whole crowd was cheering for me, and there is no way they were all Norwegian. ""So thanks to Austrian fans for making everybody feel welcome. And thanks to my injured buddy Kjetil Jansrud for being a good travel partner on the road and a great training partner. Get that knee fixed and come back!"" Svindal won the fifth gold of his career and his eighth medal overall as he headed off Italy's World Cup downhill standings leader Dominik Paris by almost half a second, with third-placed Frenchman David Poisson adrift by double that margin. ""For the super-G I was the big favorite everyone was talking about, but in skiing you can't just turn up and get your medal. The margins between ultimate success and ultimate failure are too small,"" Svindal told reporters. ""I definitely wanted to win the super-G and I didn't."" Boisson, who has never finished on the podium at a World Cup event, claimed France's first medal in the sport's premier discipline since Luc Alphand also took bronze in 1996. Home fans had to make do with fourth place as Klaus Kroll was the top Austrian finisher, with 2011 super-G runnerup Hannes Reichelt skiing out in the first of the two runs. ""I wanted to have a very good result but already did a mistake in the very beginning,"" Kroll said.

"New York (CNN) -- A man who called New York City's 911 center twice early Sunday, threatening to ""kill some cops,"" was later shot and killed by police when he charged at responding officers with a knife. Officers first used a Taser gun on Emmanuel Paulino, 24, then shot him when he continued to lunge at them, according to the New York police department. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Transcripts of the calls showed someone ready to pick a fight. 911 Operator:   ""911 Operator, where is your emergency?""

"(CNN) -- One person died and one person was wounded when an apparent altercation led to a shooting at a Seattle-area bar, police said Monday. The shooting occurred just a few hours after the Seattle Seahawks won their way into the NFL playoffs. Several players and other celebrities were among hundreds of people gathered at Munchbar, a popular nightspot in Bellevue, Washington. No players were injured in the incident, which occurred just after 1 a.m. PT Monday. Bellevue police said a 30-year-old man from Seattle was killed but did not identify him. Another man suffered a gunshot wound, police said. Investigators are trying to determine how many suspects were involved in the incident. ""We have to talk to quite a few witnesses, so we're working with some of the witnesses who were closest to the situation,"" police spokeswoman Carla Iafrate told reporters. Seahawks defensive end Greg Scruggs tweeted ""I'm OK"" and ""Everybody else is good too! .. Ignorance at its best right there"" after the shooting. CNN affiliate KING reported that the players were in a VIP lounge and were escorted to a safe place after the incident. The station also reported that Aubrey O'Day, who has appeared in several TV reality shows, tweeted that everyone in the players' group hit the floor when the gunfire erupted. In other tweets, she described how she saw a body and how people had to crawl out through the kitchen. ""I saw the guy laying on the floor and blood everywhere...

"(CNN) -- Two Southwest Airlines flights from Orange County, California, to Phoenix were the subject of security scares Tuesday night, and authorities are investigating whether the incidents are linked. Both planes were eventually cleared after officials determined a threat did not exist. Southwest Airlines flight 811 was headed to Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport from John Wayne Airport when officials removed passengers and brought in a bomb squad and canine units to search the plane, said Laura Eimiller, FBI spokeswoman in the agency's Los Angeles office said. ""No threats of any kind"" were found, said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Joe Balicki. In the second incident, Southwest flight 1184 was taken to an isolated area at Sky Harbor after it flew in from John Wayne Airport after authorities received a ""non-specific threat,"" said Ashley Dillon, the spokeswoman for the airline in Dallas. Passengers and their bags were re-screened. and authorities did not find anything, Dillon said. ""We take any kind of threat seriously,"" she said.","Both planes are eventually cleared .

"(CNN) -- Amid talk of a possible nuclear bomb test, North Korea vowed Tuesday to carry out a ""high-intensity, all-out action."" The promise emerged from a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party and was reported by the state-run news agency KCNA. ""It emphasized the necessity to continue on with launching artificial satellites ... and long-range rockets,"" the agency reported. It also said that the party leadership promised to ""stage a high-intensity, all-out action, and maximize its preparation ... so that just after an order is issued, we can destroy and sweep America and the South Korean puppet army, and achieve the historic achievement of reunified Korea."" Last month, the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on Pyongyang, after the North launched a satellite aboard a long-range rocket in December. The North Koreans responded by announcing they planned another nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. Since then, U.S. officials have told CNN they believe a nuclear test could come at any time. ""I don't think there's anything special to it, except that it comes in context of renewed trash-talking from Pyongyang. But on whole it's part and parcel of their threats to engage in more provocations,"" a senior U.S. administration official said about Tuesday's announcement. North Korea has conducted two previous nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, and proclaimed itself a ""nuclear state"" in 2012. U.S. analysts believe the 2006 test had a yield of about 1 kiloton -- comparable to the explosive power of about 1,000 tons of TNT -- while the second was roughly 2 kilotons, National Intelligence Director James Clapper told a Senate committee in 2012. By comparison, the bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was roughly 15 kilotons. CNN's Elise Labott and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's part and parcel of their threats to engage in more provocations,"" says U.S. official .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A huge mural greets visitors to the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston. It's a memorial to the building's namesake, who died unexpectedly in 1993. Hundreds of tiles are used to create the ""magic"" mural at the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston. A young Reggie Lewis, wearing his  No. 35 Boston Celtics jersey, dominates the middle of the 11-foot-by-14-foot artwork. At the bottom left is a picture of him and his wife. To his right, the face of legendary Celtic Larry Bird. But as young men in sweats and sneakers make their way into the gym, something strange happens. The mural comes alive. The photo of a beaming Lewis in formal attire transforms into Lewis the basketball player, streaking down the court. Larry Bird's picture morphs into that of another famous player, Robert Parrish. With each step, the mural transforms, representing the many scenes in one man's life. Artist Rufus B. Seder calls these ""movies for a wall"" Lifetiles. The Massachusetts artist invented the Lifetiles medium and is the only artist in the world using it. He has more than 30 Lifetiles installations around the globe.  Watch a magic mural in action » . At the Taiwan Aquarium, dolphins swim on the wall alongside awestruck children. Bucking broncos line the halls of the the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas. Dancers spin and twirl along with passengers on luxury cruise ships in the south of France. And Seder calls the the South San Francisco, California, BART station his ""own personal gallery,"" with more than 16 installations. Lifetiles don't use electricity, moving parts or tricky lighting -- just an elaborate and painstaking process done out of Seder's Eye Think Inc. studio near Boston. ""What I'm after is trying to create an experience which totally takes you by surprise,"" he said. Scanimation on the shelf . If the technology you see in Lifetiles looks familiar, you might have caught something similar at a local bookstore. The popular children's books ""Gallop!"" and ""Swing!"" were also written and illustrated by Seder. With a technique he calls scanimation, pictures in the books come alive as you flip the page. It's a kids' favorite that quite a few parents enjoy, too, based on sales numbers. ""Swing!"" and ""Gallop!"" are currently on The New York Times bestseller list. Seder originally used scanimation in greeting cards he sold at trade shows around the country. Then Workman Publishing came calling, asking Seder to develop a book based on the eye-catching technique. That's when Seder caught lightning in a bottle. After several decades as a somewhat unknown artist, he found himself flying to China to teach the scanimation technique to book makers. Just a few years later, there are over 2 million copies of ""Gallop!"" in print in more than 13 languages. Still awed by their popularity, Seder said, ""I would've been satisfied if a limited edition sold well. It totally blew my mind what happened."" Although his books' success have gained Seder some newfound publicity, the Lifetiles are truly his life's work. The relatively unknown and seemingly modern form of art isn't new at all. Seder's been working on Lifetiles for more than 20 years, inspired by toys from the 1850s called zoetropes and an active imagination as a youngster. ""I started making movies when I was 12 years old,"" he said, ""so I was always into motion pictures and especially into optical tricks and techniques that trick the eye."" How does it work? As a viewer, you don't have to learn how to see a Lifetile. It's intuitive, and one immediately understands the concept. As you walk past the mural, it begins to move along with you. But the question that immediately comes to mind -- and the one Seder gets the most -- is, ""How does it work?"" ""The short answer is, it's magic,"" Seder said. ""The longer answer is, it's like a flipbook. I've taken all the pages from a flipbook and scrambled them all together, and I've put them up on the wall and made them animate."" The lengthy process also requires attention to detail. Much like an animator, he creates a series of drawings on his computer. He then strips down each image into what becomes an indistinguishable picture made up of a series of vertical lines. This squiggly-lined image becomes the equivalent of a photo negative. The negative gets sandblasted onto a hand-cast glass tile made in Seder's studio. The heavy, 8-inch-square glass tiles get painted, scraped, fired in a kiln and finally added piece by piece to a Lifetiles mural. Hundreds of these tiles work in harmony to create a huge moving image when displayed on a wall. Seder patented the painstaking technique but thinks most other artists wouldn't have his patience, even if they had his know-how. ""It's not that I've been playing my cards close to my vest,"" he said. ""It's just very difficult to do."" A Lifetiles installation, from conception to completion, can take up to a year to complete. It's a labor of love he shares with others who walk by his ""magic"" walls. ""I love to watch people react to the work. They don't expect a wall to move,"" he said. ""They'll be walking down the hallway in a museum and walking outdoors through a zoo ... and suddenly they realize, 'Those dolphins are starting to move next to me! How is that possible?' ""","Lifetiles are murals, created without electricity or moving parts, that appear to move .

"(CNN) -- Spring is the season for new beginnings and budding romances. There are couples canoodling as they dine alfresco outside restaurants everywhere. You can practically smell the sizzling steaks as you stroll down the street. And you can't walk in the park without stumbling on a romantic picnic. Spring is all about dining in the great outdoors. It's about love and it's about barbecue sauce. As someone who has dated any number of men who make Al Bundy look like Mario Batali, I should know. My dyspeptic dating disasters inspired me to conduct a study of the male species via their stomachs. I interviewed more than 200 men and women about the connection between a man's wining and dining style and his mating style. I discovered you can divine a man's essence from his culinary style. But before you fall head-over-Manolos for a likely hunk, consider whether he is likely to give you heartburn. Now, there is no prescription for love. We each have to find our flavor. Some of us love Budweiser and burgers and others amongst us enjoy being serenaded with fragrant, freshly cooked pasta and piquant pinots. Whatever our tastes are we should heed what his dining style says about him and consider whether it dovetails to ours. Otherwise, in the long term the relationship may end up being hard to stomach. Consider if you really want to end up dating someone with the lifestyle habits of Homer Simpson or, for that matter, Charlie ""seven-ounce"" Sheen. While we often wear rosé-tinted lenses on dates that obscure us from seeing the real man, food doesn't lie. What he puts on his plate -- and yours for that matter -- creates a very telling portrait of what he will dish up as a partner. And there is no spicier season when it comes to matters of the heart and the hotplate. Here is a rundown of some of the three most popular spring dining dates and what to watch out for to get an idea if he is the perfect male dish or a recipe for romantic salmonella. The Picnic . There is nothing that typifies the spring date more than a picnic. It's sunny out, the birds are chirruping and the flowers are budding. The season practically beckons for an outdoor buffet. If a guy suggests a picnic, then I would already give him major points for having romantic inclinations. But there is a vast difference between consuming McDonald's on a park bench than sharing a carefully prepared picnic basket. If he invited you out for a picnic but forgets the blanket, substitutes beer for bubbly and instead of a restaurant-worthy repast provides a McMeal, then this guy is obviously not going to rate as any sort of gourmet Sir Galahad. He is your typical Homer Simpson type. No doubt you will find that he hasn't forgotten the cold brew: this type's solution to everything, including global warming. If you want to spend your life fetching his beers and vacuuming under his feet then he may suit you but if you want a guy who isn't domestically challenged then I would keep on shopping for a man with a well-packed lunchbox. Conversely, if your date packs a romantic meal for two: think shared nibblies, cold chicken, bubbly and even a salad, then this speaks volumes. This guy is someone who will invest in romance -- not just now but in the future. It also reveals that he has enough logistical skill to orchestrate dinner and enough motivation that you won't have to sandblast him off the couch to attend to culinary matters. This guy understands the power of food to forge moments. This goes double if he brought dessert. Barbecue Man . The barbecue is where the culinary world and unbridled masculinity meet. I don't think there is a stronger symbol of sexiness than a man at the helm of a bristling hot grill, especially when said man knows what he's doing. I could easily flip for a guy who can flip a filet mignon. If this man can also hustle up some grilled veggies, a salad and a bottle of good wine then the date is in the bag, or at least in my book. The guy who can't wait to show you his skills behind a hot griddle, is your Steak and Two Veg type. A dining traditionalist who might have varying degrees of gourmet sophistication but he is generally a provider and a protector. There is something incredibly primal that bespeaks to our origins as hunter-gatherers about the barbecue. And there is nothing like the open flame to get some sparks flying. If a guy shows competency at the hot coals, then no doubt he will be a keeper. On the converse, if you can't coax your guy away from his remote control to tend to the burning coals, then he may not only suffer the risk of vitamin D deficiency, but will likely not be much of a handyman or a helper around the house, and not to mention he will probably not even have a license to drive a hot plate. Alfresco or at Home . You would have to be Boo Radley or an agoraphobe to want to dine at home all spring. If a guy only wants to stay indoors then it means one of two things: either he has silverfish in his wallet (as he uses it so infrequently) or he is allergic to sunlight. Neither are attractive options. This guy may be a Gourmet Gigolo who wants to eat you out of house and home, waiting like a Venus Flytrap for you to feed him. Even if a guy is a superstar chef, if he gives a kebab about courtship he will try and serenade you with at least a couple of alfresco restaurant meals. If a man tells you it is just as romantic staying home and eating take out while watching the television, then you know that he is just feeding you a bunch of baloney. If a guy does take you out, his restaurant and menu choice will reveal realms about him. It is possible to tell if he's adventurous or conservative or somewhere in between. Notice if he is a sharer or covetous and if he is controlling or carefree from his culinary conduct. More than that, what about his dining deportment? Some guys wouldn't pour your wine first if both your arms were in a sling. It's easy to tell how solicitous he is or if he's completely oblivious and wouldn't notice if you fell down a manhole. If you really listen and look with all your senses you can tell a guy's key characteristics from his culinary style. Most importantly, you can tell if he makes you salivate. If a guy doesn't whet your appetite early on when he's putting his best fork forward, it is unlikely he will later on. If you seek the delicious on a date, it is likely you will find a savory suitor.","Babe Scott says you can tell a guy's key characteristics from his culinary style .

"(CNN) -- The scenes were shocking. Hooliganism is supposed to be a thing of the past, but the fighting in the streets of Warsaw during the opening week of Euro 2012 was a stark reminder that football's ""disease"" has not been cured. The first major tournament to be held in Eastern Europe has already provided a cocktail of color and a wealth of excitement on the pitch, but the violence between Russia and Poland fans has cast a shadow over the continent's showcase event. Despite being on a small scale so far, the problems have turned the spotlight towards 2018 -- when Russia will host the planet's biggest soccer spectacle, the World Cup. ""The Russian press are obviously very, very upset about what has happened,"" Russian football expert James Appell told CNN. ""How this will affect attitudes towards 2018 won't come from inside Russia, it'll be a baton that is picked up by the international press and by UEFA and international footballing authorities. ""I think Russia will only react to criticism if it comes from outside. I don't think Russian authorities have really taken the kind of steps that have been needed through pressure on a domestic front. ""I'd expect in the aftermath of what has happened that the European footballing authorities and perhaps even FIFA will step in and mandate some kind of changes that need to be made in Russian football in order for 2018 to go ahead peacefully."" Geoff Pearson, an expert on football hooliganism at England's University of Liverpool, believes Russian authorities need to take an initiative ahead of the World Cup. ""They need to be able to identify who these groups are in each city because it is almost certain these groups will look to attack certain groups of fans that travel to Russia for the World Cup in the same way the Polish hooligan groups have attacked Russian fans in Warsaw,"" Pearson told CNN. ""The important thing is that the police, between now and 2018, are able to identify who these groups are and that they are closely monitored so they don't cause trouble."" Trouble also erupted at Russia's first match as the tournament kicked off last Friday, when a black Czech Republic player was allegedly subject to racist chants and four Polish stewards attacked in the stands. It is not the first time violence has tainted the European Championship. In 1980, when Italy hosted the tournament, England's clash with Belgium had to be halted due to fighting in the stands. In 1988, police arrested English, Dutch and German fans due to violence. And at Euro 2000, nearly 1,000 England fans were arrested after riots in the Belgian cities of Charleroi and Brussels. European soccer's ruling body UEFA has often been accused of failing to properly punish such problems, but this week it fined the Russian Football Union $149,000 and threatened its national team with a six-point deduction for the Euro 2016 qualifiers if there is any repeat. It may act again over Tuesday's street brawls, where police arrested 184 people -- 157 Polish and 24 Russian -- after a Russian national day march through Poland's capital sparked confrontations. Appell believes Friday's events should have proved a forewarning. ""The violence was 100% predictable,"" he said. ""You can talk about the immediate short-term context, which was thousands of Russian fans coming over to Poland and causing trouble in the stadium in Wroclaw on Friday in the match with the Czech Republic. ""Reaction to that in Poland has been pretty unequivocal; a number of fan ultra groups vowed revenge immediately after Friday and there was some anticipation that would be carried out before the Poland-Russia fixture. ""The longer term context you can go back probably about a millennium and look at the relations between Poland and Russia, and it wouldn't be difficult to guess this is the sort of fixture that would bring those tensions to the boil."" Given the complex historical context between the two nations, it was hardly surprising that their Group A clash was preceded by violence. Their relationship has been punctuated by conflict, stretching back as far as the 11th century. Most recently, Poland was occupied by Russia under Stalin during World War Two, in a brutal chapter that saw the Red Army commit multiple numbers of atrocities. Tuesday's march, which marked the establishment of Russian sovereignty in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, was sanctioned by the Polish authorities. Inside the stadium just before kickoff in Tuesday's game, Russian fans unfurled a huge banner that read ""This is Russia"" -- which some commentators claimed carried Neo-Nazi symbols on it. It depicted Dmitry Pozharsky, a Russian prince who led resistance to Polish-Lithuanian rule in the 17th century. It provoked another familiar question when it comes to the issue of football in Russia: how easy is it to separate the soccer from the politics? ""It's very hard and I'd say that goes not just for international fixtures but also for Russian domestic football fan culture,"" Appell said. ""At your average Russian Premier League game the kind of slogans, iconography and symbolism such as flags, banners and chant that wouldn't have looked entirely out of place at a nationalist march outside football territory. ""It's very difficult sometimes to separate what you're seeing as an expression of football culture and an expression of nationalistic culture."" But just as the authorities have done, Appell is keen to stress that the pockets of trouble witnessed in the tournament's first week do not mean UEFA was wrong to award the tournament to Poland and Ukraine. ""I actually think on whole, if you leave aside Group A fixtures, the experiences the vast majority fans have had in Poland and Ukraine have been extremely positive. This is about the behavior of the football fan and not the location in which they are behaving."" Polish police said their swift intervention when Tuesday's violence escalated prevented further casualties, and claimed fans carrying knuckledusters and batons were not interested in the football. The police also reiterated that over half a million people have so far attended matches, or fan zone areas, highlighting the small number of incidents leading to arrest. Poland's sports minister Joanna Mucha said she was both ""disgusted"" and ""ashamed"" -- and vowed not to let a small minority spoil an atmosphere at the tournament she described as ""fantastic."" Despite the outrage, Pearson agreed that the chaos in Warsaw was preventable. ""I can't be 100% sure as I wasn't there but what happened in Warsaw seemed to be a complete mess,"" he told CNN. ""Historical tensions make it a high risk event. The bottom line is, we wouldn't have seen trouble had there not been between 10,000 and 20,000 Russian fans in Warsaw. There were obviously things that went wrong on the day. ""There was a situation where hooligans of both teams mixed in with other crowds, that meant normal fans got attacked and were subject to quite aggressive policing. That's when we move from these small criminal groups fighting to wider disorder. ""No doubt there were groups of both Polish and Russian supporters who attended that match with a view to confrontation. We're talking relatively small numbers here and it should be possible to police those groups and, if possible, exclude them from the stadium.""","Soccer violence at Euro 2012 sparks fears for 2018 World Cup in Russia .

"Mumbai (CNN) -- In India, gold is gifted at weddings, when a baby is born, during festivals, to mark a promotion -- at any celebratory occasion. Walk into any gold shop, at any time of the year, and you are bound to find customers choosing a gold bracelet or biscuit. It's part and parcel of Indian culture. In the heart of Mumbai's Jhaveri Bazaar, which translates into jewellery market, 24 year old Alfiya Bhombal shops for her wedding. She's come with her parents. The family will gift Alfiya and her groom gold at their wedding. Between trying on various necklaces and earrings, Bhombhal says ""no bride will look the part without it."" Buying gold is a cultural habit in India -- one that's also driven by economics. More than half of India's population is unbanked. People who live in its villages are illiterate. Investing in a bank or a financial instrument is almost out of the question of this section of society. The easiest way to make an investment is to buy a piece of gold - a hard asset that can be stored at home. It gives good returns -- domestic gold prices rose around 13% last year. There's one big problem with India's greed for gold. India doesn't produce any of the precious metal domestically. Everything that's consumed here, is imported. Just last year, that cost India $56 billion dollars -- and is one of the main reasons behind India's fiscal deficit ballooning. It touched a record high of 5.4% of India's gross domestic product in the July to September quarter last year. That data had India's Finance Minister worried. In January, P Chidambaram said, ""we may be left with no choice but to make it a little bit more expensive to import gold."" He then raised the import duty on gold and platinum from 4 to 6% in an effort to curb demand. Mohit Kamboj, President of the Bombay Bullion Association says he does not think this hike in gold import duty will affect a consumers appetite for gold, even if it means a gold bracelet may cost a little bit more. He said property prices have been hit by recession, the stock market hasn't given good returns. ""No one has got much return on investment besides gold."" Investing in gold has been good for the retailer but according to Shubhada Rao, Chief Economist of Yes Bank, it's been a drag on the Indian economy. ""Because savings have gone into gold, the financial savings have begun to deplete and that has caused structural liquidity in the banks to get lower,"" she said. Across stores in India, it doesn't change much. Jewellery shops remain bustling and Bhombhal, unbothered by the government's decision to raise the import duty on gold. Buying gold is a centuries old tradition in India, one that few -- including Bhombhal -- are willing to give up.","India bought $56 billion in gold in 2012 -- all imported .

"(CNN) -- 1977 -- Penn State football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky founds the Second Mile, a charity to help troubled youths. 1994-97 -- According to the grand jury report, Sandusky allegedly engages in inappropriate conduct with three different boys he met separately through the Second Mile program. One boy was 7 or 8, another was 10, and the third was 12 or 13 at the time. According to the grand jury report, the now-adult men said Sandusky engaged in inappropriate conduct ranging from touching to outright sexual encounters, including several incidents during the nights before Penn State football home games, when the team, staff and boys Sandusky had allegedly invited were staying at a hotel. 1998 -- Penn State police and the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare investigate an incident in which the mother of an 11-year-old boy reported that Sandusky had showered with her son and may have had inappropriate conduct with him. In a June 1, 1998, interview with investigators from both agencies, Sandusky admits showering naked with the boy, admitting that it was wrong and promising not to do it again, according to the grand jury report. The district attorney advises investigators that no charges will be filed and the university police chief instructs that the case be closed, according to the testimony included in the grand jury report from the police detective who investigated the incident. 1999 -- Sandusky retires from Penn State after coaching there for 32 years but stays on as a volunteer and retains full access to the campus and football facilities. 2000 -- Sandusky allegedly showers with a young boy and tries to touch his genitals during overnight stays at the coach's house, according to the now 24-year-old man's testimony included in the grand jury report. 2000 -- Jim Calhoun, a janitor at the Lasch Football Building on the Penn State campus, tells his supervisor and another janitor that he saw Sandusky performing oral sex on a young boy, according to the grand jury report. A second janitor reports that he saw Sandusky and a boy leave a shower room and walk out of the building hand in hand. No one reports the alleged incidents to university officials or law enforcement, according to the grand jury report. March 2, 2002 -- According to the grand jury report, a graduate assistant allegedly tells Head Coach Joe Paterno that he saw Sandusky in the locker room shower the night before, performing anal sex on a young boy he estimated to be 10 years old. March 3, 2002 -- Paterno reports the incident to Athletic Director Tim Curley, saying the graduate assistant had seen Sandusky ""fondling or doing something of a sexual nature to a young boy,"" according to the grand jury. Later, the assistant is summoned to a meeting with Curley and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz.. While the assistant later insisted to the grand jury that he told Curley and Schultz that he saw Sandusky and the boy engaged in anal sex, Curley and Schultz told the grand jury they had not been told of such an allegation. Instead, Curley said he had the impression the conduct amounted to nonsexual ""horsing around."" Schultz said he couldn't remember details but seemed to recall that ""Sandusky might have inappropriately grabbed the young boy's genitals while wrestling,"" according to the grand jury. Sandusky's locker-room keys are confiscated, he is told not to bring his Second Mile participants to campus, and the incident is reported to the charity, but no law enforcement investigation is launched, according to the grand jury. 2002 -- The Second Mile learns of the alleged shower incident. Curley tells the charity that ""the information had been internally reviewed and that there was no finding of wrongdoing,"" the group said in a statement Monday. 2005 or 2006 -- Sandusky allegedly befriends another Second Mile participant, whose allegations would form the foundation of the multiyear grand jury investigation. 2006 or 2007 -- A wrestling coach at the high school where Sandusky is volunteering allegedly surprises Sandusky and a boy ""lying on their sides, in physical contact, face to face on a mat"" in a cramped weight room. Sandusky jumps to his feet and tells the coach the two were just working on wrestling moves, the coach later recalls in grand jury testimony. As time goes on, Sandusky allegedly begins to spend more time with the boy, taking him to sporting events and giving him gifts, including golf clubs, a computer, cash and clothes. During this period, according to the grand jury report, Sandusky allegedly performs oral sex on the boy more than 20 times, and the boy performs oral sex on him once. 2008 -- The boy breaks off contact with Sandusky. Later, his mother calls the high school to report her son had been sexually assaulted, and the principal bars Sandusky from campus and reports the incident to police. In grand jury testimony, the principal, Steven Turchetta, recalls Sandusky's behavior as suspicious and says Sandusky was often ""clingy"" and ""needy"" when a student no longer wanted to spend time with him. The ensuing investigation reveals 118 calls from Sandusky's home and cell phone numbers to the boy's home. November 2008 -- Sandusky informs the Second Mile that he is under investigation, and he is removed from all program activities involving children, according to the group. September 2010 -- Sandusky retires from the Second Mile, according to the grand jury. November 4, 2011 -- The grand jury report is released. November 5 -- Authorities arrest Sandusky on seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and numerous other charges, including aggravated indecent assault, corruption of minors and endangering the welfare of a child. He is freed on $100,000 unsecured bail. Curley, 57, and Schultz, 62, are each charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations. November 6 -- Curley asks for and is granted administrative leave to deal with the charges, while Schultz steps down from his post to retire. November 7 -- Penn State students rally outside Paterno's home. November 9 -- Paterno issues a statement saying he will retire at the end of the 2011 football season, adding, ""I wish I had done more."" The U.S. Department of Education says it will launch an investigation into whether Penn State failed to comply with an act requiring colleges and universities to disclose the number of reported criminal incidents on campus each year. University trustees announce that night that Paterno and University President Graham Spanier have been removed, effective immediately. Angry students riot in State College, Pennsylvania. November 10 -- Sandusky's attorney, Joseph Amendola, tells CNN his client disputes the grand jury report and is ""destroyed"" over what happened to Paterno. Penn State says Mike McQueary, the graduate assistant who saw the alleged 2002 incident involving Sandusky and a young boy, will not be at Saturday's football game because of ""multiple threats."" November 11 -- Penn State officials say they will create a special panel to investigate the allegations. The university announces McQueary has been placed on ""indefinite"" leave. Students hold a candlelight vigil to honor the alleged victims. Authorities in San Antonio say they are investigating the possibility that Sandusky might have committed sex crimes there in 1999 when Penn State played in the Alamo Bowl, CNN affiliates report. Victim 4 in the Pennsylvania grand jury report had been listed as a member of Sandusky's family party for the bowl game. November 12 -- Fans hold a moment of silence before Penn State's football team plays Nebraska. The Nittany Lions lose, 17-13.

Tom Corbett says on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" November 14 -- Questions arise regarding Judge Leslie Dutchcot, who released Sandusky on $100,000 bail. The judge's former law firm listed her as a volunteer for The Second Mile. The Second Mile's CEO, Jack Raykovitz, resigns. November 14 -- In an interview with NBC's Bob Costas, Sandusky maintains he is innocent and denies he is a pedophile. Sandusky admits he has ""horsed around"" and ""done some of the things"" in the grand jury report, but says the only thing he did wrong was having ""showered with kids."" Amendola calls Sandusky ""a big, overgrown kid."" November 15 -- The Morning Call newspaper of Allentown, Pennsylvania, reports that McQueary wrote in an e-mail to a former classmate that he helped stop the 2002 assault and talked with police about it. ""I did stop it, not physically, but made sure it was stopped when I left that locker room,"" McQueary wrote.","Penn State's football coach and president have lost their jobs .

"London (CNN) -- The streets of London are paved with Olympic gold.

McDonald's and BT branded telephone boxes stand on street corners, lit by lamp posts emblazoned with the LOCOG sign of the organizing committee. The business Olympics are well underway. Blog: Olympics: Money spinner or dud? There are eleven global ""top-tier"" sponsors of the games, each paying around $100 million for a contract, and 44 other sponsors. These companies are the only ones that can display the London 2012 logo -- or any Olympic branding. The brand police, made up of 280 enforcement officers from the Olympic Delivery Authority, along with a LOCOG brand protection team, will be clamping down on businesses that use pictures of the Olympic rings and words that include ""Olympics,"" ""2012,"" ""medals,"" ""gold,"" and even ""London."" Read also: Is the Olympics worth more than Google? The $100 million price tag to official Olympic sponsorship is well protected, but what will these companies get in return? According to Luc Bardin, group chief sales and marketing officer of top-tier sponsor BP, the biggest benefit is the association with such a powerful brand. ""Selling petrol is one way in which we express and serve society, but it is by a long distance not the only one,"" he said. ""[What's] incredibly important is the way in which we are part of this country, in other countries' lives, and in many villages and communities."" Cadbury is the official ""treat provider"" with a sponsorship covering the UK. Norman Brodie, general manager of the Cadbury London 2012 program, agrees with Bardin. ""It makes fantastic business sense if you can use this to excite people,"" he said. ""It's the catalytic property, the transformational property of being a part of the Olympics -- that's the gold dust, the magic dust and what we have done is sprayed it around."" The Olympics is the second most valuable brand in the world, after Apple, according to a report by Brand Finance. They calculate the Olympic brand is worth more than all of its other major sponsors -- including Samsung, GE and Coca-Cola -- put together. They have valued the Olympics brand at $47.6 billion, an 87% increase since the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Comment: Olympic sponsorship: Must it be so unhealthy? David Haigh, chief executive of Brand Finance said, ""Companies will cough up large amounts of money to sponsor sports, events, teams and individuals if they believe they are going to get the money back."" According to Haigh, it is now mainstream for companies to use high level analysis to determine how much of a return they can expect to get from sponsorship of events. ""The Olympics seem to work,"" he said, ""and [those companies] are getting bigger and bigger budgets.""

"(CNN) -- Barcelona defender Eric Abidal is to undergo surgery to replace his liver, according to a statement released on the Spanish club's website on Thursday. ""During the next few weeks, the player will undergo a liver transplant as a result of the progress of his liver disease,"" the statement said. ""A transplant was considered an option from the start of his treatment a year ago. At the express wishes of the player, the Club asks that the maximum respect for the player's privacy be observed."" The 32-year-old Frenchman underwent surgery to remove a tumor on his liver last March, but recovered in time to appear in the Champions League final against Manchester United two months later. Barcelona club captain Carles Puyol described the news of Abibal's impending surgery as ""a heavy blow"" at a press conference Thursday. ""It was an unpleasant surprise. Eric was there with us and afterwards we spoke with him, but what we said will be staying amongst ourselves,"" Puyol said, FCBarcelona.com reported. ""It's really him who has lifted us -- he's so strong as he showed last season and I'm sure he'll show that again now...things like this bring us all closer together."" Dr Stuart Knechtle, a liver transplant specialist from Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, says Abidal has a good chance of returning to top-level football in the future. ""Assuming it all goes well, he should be able to compete. There are other examples of athletes that have competed at international level after liver transplantation,"" Knechtle told CNN's World Sport. Knechtle highlighted the cases of Chris Klug, a U.S. Olympic snowboarder who competed after his liver transplant in 2000 and former NBA star Alonzo Mourning who also returned to action after a kidney transplant in 2003. The transplant is a highly complex procedure which will require intensive medical care, says Knechtle, but after an initial recovery period Abidal should be able to recover his strength. ""He will need to take medication twice a day for the rest of his life. He will, especially in the early period, require multiple doctor's visits, but that should gradually taper off over time.""","Barcelona defender Eric Abidal to have surgery to replace liver in coming weeks .

"(CNN) -- Two years ago, Egyptians toppled a longtime dictator and reveled in the hope of a new future. But frustration over the new leadership and controversial court verdicts have ignited clashes regularly. Here's what's behind the most recent unrest, which flared up on the two-year anniversary of the revolution. What sparked this latest rash of violence? Two seemingly unrelated developments. Friday was the two-year anniversary of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Protesters who have been angry with the slow pace of change and with some of the steps President Mohamed Morsy has taken clashed with his supporters and police in the cities such as Suez and Ismailia. At least seven people were killed in those clashes, including several by gunfire. It was not immediately clear who was responsible. Then on Saturday, a judge issued death sentences for 21 people from Port Said for their roles in a football game riot last year. The court rulings sparked deadly clashes between security forces and relatives of the convicted. Over the course of two days, at least 38 people -- including civilians and soldiers -- were killed in Port Said. ` Dubbed the ""massacre at Port Said"" by Egyptian media, the riot broke out on February 1, 2012, after Port Said-based Al-Masry defeated Cairo's Al-Ahly, 3-1. The riot left 74 people dead and 1,000 injured. Fans from both sides bashed each other with rocks and chairs. It was unclear whether intense sports rivalries or political strife sparked the melee. What's the back story of tensions between Port Said and Cairo? Port Said residents say they have grievances that date back six decades. Over the past 60 years, residents of Port Said have felt betrayed by Egyptian security forces during a series of wars with Israel. Thousands of residents were displaced several times because of the Suez War, the Six-Day War of 1967, the War of Attrition with Israel, and the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. Residents of Port Said, in northeastern Egypt, believed security forces did not adequately defend their city. In addition, some say Cairo has not invested enough in Port Said's infrastructure, and that their city doesn't reap enough tax benefits from trade with international ships that pass though Port Said via the critical Suez Canal. Some also say Port Said is still getting the cold shoulder from Cairo after a 1999 assassination attempt of then-President Hosni Mubarak, who was visiting the city. Why are some Egyptians angry with Morsy? Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, came to power last June following Mubarak's ouster a year earlier. But accusations of power hoarding soon followed. Morsy issued a sweeping presidential decree in November, which prevented any court from overturning his decisions until a new, post-Mubarak constitution was passed. The ruling essentially gave him unchecked power, protecting from judicial review any decisions he has made since assuming office. Protesters decried the ""birth of a new pharaoh"" and ""Morsy the dictator."" But Morsy defended his move, saying it was only temporary until a new constitution is put in place. He said it was intended to safeguard the revolution, in part by preventing courts from interfering with the work of Egypt's Constituent Assembly, the body charged with drafting a new constitution. The judges, many of whom were holdover loyalists from the government of Mubarak, are widely viewed as hostile to the Islamists who now dominate the assembly that has been charged with framing a new constitution. The constitution eventually passed with a nearly two-thirds majority. What happens now? During a speech Sunday night, Morsy declared a limited state of emergency for violent hot spots and announced a 30-day nighttime curfew for the provinces of Port Said, Ismailia and Suez. Morsy said some protesters' violent behavior ""does not have anything to do with the Egyptian revolution. ... In fact, it is against the revolution."" But he acknowledged the legitimate dissent in Egypt, saying ""dialogue is the only way to bring about stability and security."" To this end, he invited representatives from 11 political parties to a meeting Monday. The meeting ""is meant to address problems in Egypt, as opposed to express anger,"" Morsy's spokesman told state-run TV. But for a country that has seen rounds of change, dissent, celebration and violence, it's unclear what the next chapter will be. CNN's Reza Sayah and Tim Hume contributed to this report.","Protests on the two-year anniversary of the revolution left seven people dead Friday .

"(CNN) -- The Texas town of Groesbeck is on the verge of running dry. ""We have about two weeks of water left,"" Groesbeck Mayor Jackie Levingston said. Her central Texas town, population 4,300, is one of the latest victim's of the state's ongoing drought. A lack of rain and the summer's intense heat -- more than 90 days of triple-digit temperatures -- combined to dry out the Groesbeck water supply. ""We lost more water to evaporation than we were using this summer,"" Levingston said in a telephone interview. Fort Parker Lake is the city's primary source of water. Heat evaporation took roughly 731 million gallons of water from the lake. The city used only 54 million. Groesbeck residents spent Monday waiting on the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife to approve an emergency three-mile pipeline to divert water off the Navasota River, using a public creek as a stop-gap to shorten the distance. ""Our water comes from a river, that goes into a lake, then comes down a river. We came up with a plan to go around the lake,"" said the mayor. The city already has approval from another agency, the Texas Quality Commission on Environmental Quality, for seven miles of alternative pipeline, but with the clock ticking, Levington said residents can't afford the two weeks to lay the piping in the approved plan. The new plan will take the city four days to construct. ""I might as well be optimistic,"" the mayor said, laughing. There is a bit to be optimistic this week -- Thanksgiving week. Outside of the local federal prison, the school district is the biggest water user. Some 1,600 children -- many from outside the city limits in surrounding Limestone County -- draw on Groesbeck's water supply on school days. But schools are out for the holiday this week. ""We are counting on this to extend our usage,"" said Levingston. She speculates it may buy the town an extra week. The pipeline, when it happens, is a temporary fix. It will cost $200,000 in construction, and $35,000 per month on pipe rental. The city is calculating using it for six months even though officials have drought-forecast beyond that. The city also is contracting with a well driller out of Austin to search for ground water.","Like much of Texas, the town of Groesbeck suffered through a summer of intense heat .

"(CNN) -- This is starting to sound like a broken record, but once again, 2011 was an incredibly safe year for commercial air travel. In fact, there were only 373 fatalities on 18 scheduled passenger flights worldwide. Considering that there are roughly 10 million flights per year in the U.S. alone, this is a remarkable feat. Looking at the Aviation Safety Network's database, we see that there were 106 ""occurrences"" of all kinds during the year worldwide. This number includes military and cargo aircraft accidents as well as airplanes on test flights. One of the accidents last year was actually with an illegal crop-dusting operation in Russia. So this is pretty detailed. Including all those various occurrences, 50 in total had fatalities; many of the rest were things like edging over the end of the runway. But once we narrow that number down again to just scheduled passenger flights, we get 18. Now, 18 fatal accidents still sounds like a lot. After all, could you imagine hearing about one or two major accidents every month? Most of these, however, probably never made the news here in America. In the U.S., not a single passenger was killed in an accident on a scheduled passenger flight the entire year. There was one tiny scheduled flight that crashed in Alaska, killing the pilot, but both passengers survived. A couple of bush flying accidents in Northern Canada claimed three lives as well, but that was it for this immediate part of the world. But wait, weren't there some newsmakers in the U.S. this year? Sure, you heard about the Southwest 737 that had the fuselage tear open at cruising altitude, but everyone walked away in good shape. (OK, maybe nerves were rattled.) The rest of the accidents happened in primarily developing areas. The worst offender over the past year has been Russia, where three accidents killed 56 people. This was in addition to several landing accidents that were not fatal and one major crash of a charter flight that killed an entire professional hockey team. Though this does not make flying in Russia unsafe, it certainly was one of the hotspots that should cause alarm for Russian aviation officials. There were two accidents in Indonesia as well as one in Congo. These were on airlines that have been put on the banned list by the European Union for being unsafe, so many people wouldn't even consider flying them in the first place. There was an accident on a domestic flight in Iran, one on a tourist flight in Nepal, one on a prop in Papua New Guinea and five on turboprops in Latin America. In Europe, there was only one, a turboprop that crashed in Ireland in bad weather. You're probably wondering what caused these accidents. As usual, none of these was caused by a single issue, but most of them were operating in challenging weather conditions at the time. In some of the more remote places in the world, they don't have the same kind of weather detection systems or the conservative procedures that we have here in the U.S., and that can make a difference in the accident rate. Looking through all this data, one thing is clear. Flying remains an incredibly safe mode of transport. Although there will always be an effort to get to zero accidents, that simply won't happen with something as complex as aircraft operations. But each year, more aircraft take to the skies, and the chances of something going wrong continue to drop.","In the U.S., not a single passenger was killed in an accident on a passenger flight .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A Congolese rebel group advanced within four kilometers (2.4 miles) of Goma in the violence-riddled eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday evening, according to eyewitnesses, threatening to take the strategic capital of the region. Heavy fighting has been reported in recent days as rebel groups battled the Congolese army and U.N. soldiers. A relative calm on Sunday morning in Goma was broken by fighting close to the town and airport. ""Some government officials and diplomats have fled to Bukavu (in eastern Congo) and across the border to Rwanda,"" said a journalist in Goma who did not want to be named for his own security. U.N. Forces in the region of North Kivu said that they deployed attack helicopters and ground troops to respond to the M23 advances on Goma. The eastern part of Congo has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border fearing reprisals following the genocide in neighboring Rwanda. In 1998 the vast nation -- previously known as Zaire -- became a battleground for eight African countries. More than 5 million people died in the war and its aftermath, making it the deadliest conflict since World War II. Despite the signing of peace accords in 2003, fighting continues in the eastern part of Congo between various rebel groups and the Congolese army, which is back by U.N. peacekeepers. Early on Saturday, rebel soldiers launched attacks on several key towns north of Goma using heavy weapons, said the U.N. Congo mission in a press release. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency session on Saturday, condemning the latest attacks by the M23 rebel group. ""The members of the Security Council strongly condemn the resumption of attacks by the M23 and demand their immediate cessation,"" said Ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri of India, which holds the Council's rotating presidency. Soldiers from the M23 group had been part of the national army as part of peace negotiations brokered in 2009. They broke away from the Congolese army in April of this year, complaining about a lack of pay and poor conditions. One of their commanders, Bosco Ntaganda, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, including recruiting child soldiers. The U.N. and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebel group by providing it arms, support and even soldiers. It is a allegation that Paul Kagame, Rwanda's president, has repeatedly denied. But security analysts say the rebellion in eastern Congo has dangerous regional implications, and the international community has expressed alarm at the latest M23 advancement. ""I call on the M23 to immediately stop the military offensive against the city of Goma. Any support to the M23 in violation of the sanctions ... and the arms embargo must stop,"" said Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign affairs chief. Residents of Goma were close to panic on Sunday, but no one had fled across the border to Rwanda yet. ""But who knows what will happen overnight,"" said one resident.","The eastern part of Congo has been embroiled in violence since 1994 .

"(CNN) -- The suicide bombing in Ankara Friday is a reminder to counterterrorism agencies that it's not just jihadist groups who threaten Western governments and their interests overseas. Pockets of the extreme left and extreme right still consider political violence legitimate -- among them the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party in Turkey. Turkish authorities have blamed the U.S. Embassy attack on the group, better known as DHKP-C, and are in the process of identifying the bomber. Analysts say it is likely the attack had two aims -- to embarrass the Turkish government and to demonstrate the group's hostility to the deployment of Patriot anti-missile batteries on Turkish soil. Several members of the group are thought to be close to the Syrian regime. Leftist terror group claims responsibility for U.S. Embassy bombing . DHKP-C has a relationship with the Turkish Kurdish separatist group PKK, which is also close to the Syrian government. About one-third of the PKK's fighters are said to be Syrian, according to regional analysts. DHKP-C is viscerally hostile to the Turkish state, the United States and NATO, and has had links with the far-left in Europe. In recent days, Turkish police have arrested several dozen people suspected of links with DHKP-C, among them a number of lawyers. However, Human Rights Watch called the arrests an ""arbitrary and abusive use of anti-terrorism laws in Turkey."" Turkish authorities believe the suicide bomber Friday was Ecevit Sanli, a longtime member of the group. DNA tests are being conducted to confirm his identity. Sanli received bomb-making training somewhere in Europe in the mid-1990s, according to Hasa Selim Ozertem, a security expert at the International Strategic Research Organization in Ankara. Turkish officials say that as a result of counterterrorism operations on Turkish soil, DHKP-C became increasingly active among the Turkish diaspora in Europe. Sanli returned to Turkey in 1997 and was subsequently involved in attacks on the Istanbul police headquarters and senior military officials using anti-tank weapons. After being arrested, Sanli went on a lengthy hunger strike and was released from jail in 2002 because of a neurological disorder. A Cold War dynamic in Turkish attack . DHKP-C has been active for more than 30 years and espouses a Marxist-Leninist philosophy reminiscent of the Cold War. It grew out of another far-left group, Devrimci Sol (Revolutionary Left), formed when Turkey was in political turmoil, with clashes between militant left- and right-wing groups undermining a weak political system. Devrimci Sol claimed responsibility for gun attacks that killed two Americans, including a U.S. military employee, and an attack that wounded a U.S. military officer in early 1991 in protest of the Gulf War. Among other attacks attributed to the DHKP-C was the assassination of a former justice minister, Mehmet Topac, in 1994, as well as the murders of a number of senior police and military officials and, 1996, a prominent businessman, Ozdemir Sabanci. Among its more recent operations was an attempt to kill another former justice minister, Hikmet Sami Turk, in 2009. The female suicide bomber's main explosive charge did not go off. Security analysts say the latest attack is very similar to one launched on an Istanbul police station last year. Again, a former hunger striker who was critically sick with cancer arrived at the police station wearing a belt stuffed with explosives and triggered the bomb just before passing through an X-ray machine. Ozertem told CNN he is unaware of any links between DHKP-C and al Qaeda-type actors, but the possibility can't be entirely dismissed because al Qaeda sympathizers have become increasingly active in the region. The Turkish National Police assessment of the group says, ""American, European and Israeli companies and enterprises are also among the targets of DHKP-C since they are considered by the terrorist organization as assets of global imperialism."" It says the group is also involved in drug trafficking to finance its operations. Analysts consulted by CNN do not believe the organization has the capacity to launch a sustained terrorist campaign, nor penetrate security at well-guarded installations. Its last known attack aimed at a U.S. target in Turkey was in 1999, when two men tried to fire a rocket at the U.S. Consulate General building in Istanbul. Both were killed in a subsequent firefight.","Friday's bombing in Ankara harkens back to Cold War political violence .

"(CNN) -- I recently watched images of President Obama and Gov. Christie of New Jersey pledging to work together to get emergency aid to Hurricane Sandy's victims as quickly as possible. Gov. Christie, you'll recall, gave the keynote address at the Republican National Convention and spent a fair amount of time lambasting Obama during the campaign. But as they toured the damaged coastline together, I thought that many women watching across the country would be moved by the leadership of these two men and their willingness to transcend their partisan differences. A Washington Post Tracking Poll seemed to confirm this: 26% of women nationally -- more than men, at 18% -- reported that Obama's handling of the hurricane response would be a major factor in determining their vote for president. Politicians take note: Women are often motivated by different things than men. Opinion: Women gain wider access to power . And with their votes in Tuesday's election, women sent important messages to President Obama and to leaders of both parties. A majority of women voted to re-elect the president, while a slightly smaller majority of men voted for Romney, according to exit polls. Obama also won a majority of women's votes, with Romney winning a majority of men's, in critical battleground states such as Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire. Why did women and men vote this way? The answer lies in part in their different views about government and the role it should play in our lives. First, women were voting for a more affirmative role on the part of the federal government. Men, more than women, have long said they favor dramatic cutbacks in the size of government. Women, more than men, worry that cutbacks will go too far; they are concerned with preserving America's social safety net for those in needâ€”programs such as Medicaid, school lunches and child nutrition programs, and Supplemental Security Income for elderly and disabled individuals. This will be particularly important as President Obama and Congress work on a deal to save the country from falling off the fiscal cliff. Women will be watching to make sure that the basic social infrastructure is not threatened. Second, women care about their own health and welfare, and that of their families and other Americans. Consequently, they denied their votes to candidates that showed extremism on issues such as abortion and contraception and backed those who supported women's right to control their reproductive decisions. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the Senate contests in Missouri and Indiana, two conservative states where voters strongly preferred Romney in the presidential race. But in the Senate race the majority of women voted for Democrat Claire McCaskill, while only about a third voted for Republican Todd Akin, who in a discussion of his no-exceptions policy on abortion, said in a televised interview in August that ""if it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."" Similarly, in Indiana, a majority of women voted for Democrat Joe Donnelly, helping him defeat Republican Richard Mourdock, who said in a U.S. Senate debate that ""even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that is something that God intended to happen."" Women's personal views on abortion may vary, but few are not offended by extreme statements like these. Women voters, in general, would prefer that lawmakers devote their energy to solving the nation's economic problems rather than regulating and restricting women's access to contraception and their ability to make reproductive choices. Finally, women want strong leaders who can work across party lines to solve problems -- which brings us back to Christie and Obama. Women who were moved by Obama's actions along the Jersey Shore would likely be pleased if he showed the same kind of unifying leadership in Washington. That may in part be why they helped reelect him. And they would be equally pleased to see Congress set aside its petty bickering and partisan gamesmanship and work with the president to solve the very grave problems our country confronts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Susan Carroll.","Susan Carroll: Obama, Christie working together after Sandy resonated for women voters .
She says it's because women motivated by different things -- like cooperation -- than men .
She says women voters sent message. First, they want strong social safety net .

"(CNN) -- Scientific evidence shows that the health benefits of circumcising baby boys outweigh the risks, America's top pediatrics group said Monday. But the ""benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision,"" the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a policy statement, and the decision to circumcise should be up to the parents in consultation with the child's doctor. ""Scientific research shows clearer health benefits to the procedure than had previously been demonstrated,"" said the group, which represents 60,000 pediatricians in the United States and Canada. It also said the health benefits are great enough for insurance coverage. A debate has emerged over the practice. Circumcision, the removal of the foreskin from the penis, is a religious rite commonly practiced by Jews and Muslims and is a widely accepted and common medical practice. But staunch critics of the procedure say it is not medically necessary and carries the risk of complications and pain. Why I didn't circumcise my sons . ""Scientific research shows clearer health benefits to the procedure than had previously been demonstrated. According to a systematic and critical review of the scientific literature, the health benefits of circumcision include lower risks of acquiring HIV, genital herpes, human papilloma virus and syphilis. Circumcision also lowers the risk of penile cancer over a lifetime; reduces the risk of cervical cancer in sexual partners, and lowers the risk of urinary tract infections in the first year of life,"" the group said. Johns Hopkins University researchers recently concluded that the rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases are likely to climb as American parents increasingly leave their baby boys uncircumcised. ""The medical benefits of male circumcision are quite clear,"" said Dr. Aaron Tobian, an assistant professor of pathology at Johns Hopkins and lead author of the study published in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. ""But while the medical evidence has been increasingly more positive, male circumcision rates in the U.S. have been decreasing."" Mom: Why I chose circumcision for my boys . But such benefits may not trump ""other considerations for individual families."" The study also says the procedure poses rare risks such as ""bleeding and swelling."" ""Although the evidence also is clear that infants experience pain, there are several safe and effective ways to reduce the pain. If the baby is born prematurely, has an illness at birth, or has congenital abnormalities or blood problems, he should not be circumcised immediately,"" the AAP said. ""For example, if a condition called hypospadias is present, in which the infant's urinary opening has not formed normally, your doctor will probably recommend that your baby boy not be circumcised at birth. In fact, circumcision should be performed only on stable, healthy infants."" And the procedure, the AAP said, ""is safest and offers the most health benefits if performed during the newborn period,"" it said. Newborn circumcision ""should be performed by trained and competent providers, using sterile techniques and effective pain management,"" it said. Dr. Susan Blank, chairwoman of the task force that produced the AAP policy statement and technical report, said it's ultimately up to the parents. ""Parents are entitled to medically accurate and non-biased information about circumcision, and they should weigh this medical information in the context of their own religious, ethical and cultural beliefs,"" Blank said. AAP: Health benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks . She said parents should speak to a doctor about benefits and risks and ""discuss who will perform the circumcision."" ""It's a good idea to have this conversation during pregnancy, and to learn whether your insurance will cover the procedure, so you have time to make the decision,"" Blank said. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has endorsed the policy as well. ""This information will be helpful for obstetricians who are often the medical providers who counsel parents about circumcision,"" said Dr. Sabrina Craigo, MD, the college's liaison to the AAP task force on circumcision. ""We support the idea that parents choosing circumcision should have access to the procedure.""

"(Health.com) -- The million-plus U.S. adults who take medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) do not appear to be increasing their risk of heart attack or stroke, as some experts have feared, according to a new study published today on the website of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Stimulant medications -- a class that includes Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta, and their generic versions -- and the non-stimulant drug Strattera have all been shown to slightly raise blood pressure and heart rate, which can contribute to heart problems. Researchers haven't conclusively linked these side effects to heart attacks, strokes, or sudden death from heart-related causes, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received numerous reports of these and other heart problems in people taking stimulants for ADHD. In 2006, the FDA ordered stimulant manufacturers to add warnings about potential heart risks to their product labels, although the agency stopped short of requiring the so-called black box warning an advisory panel had recommended. Health.com: 15 signs you may have adult ADHD . The new study, which was funded and partly overseen by the FDA and other federal health agencies, is the largest of its kind to date and seems to bear out the FDA's decision to opt for a milder label warning. Researchers at several large health insurers across the nation analyzed the medical and pharmacy records of 443,198 people between the ages of 25 and 64, roughly one-third of whom had filled prescriptions for stimulants or Strattera. After controlling for other factors that can increase cardiovascular risk (such as smoking), the authors found no increase in heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac death rates among people who were currently using an ADHD drug. Nor did they find any differences in cardiovascular risk among people who had taken ADHD medications in the past and those taking them currently. Health.com: The worst habits for your heart . Although the findings should allay the fears of people taking these medications, the study doesn't entirely rule out the possibility of small increases in heart risk, says lead author Laurel Habel, Ph.D., a research scientist with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, in Oakland, Calif. ""Our study suggests that these drugs are not associated with a markedly elevated risk, but we can't say that they're completely safe,"" Habel says. ""It makes sense for patients and doctors to talk about the potential risks."" The study had several limitations that prevent firmer conclusions about the drugs' safety. The researchers couldn't confirm that the participants actually consumed the prescriptions they filled, for instance, and they followed the participants for an average of just 16 months. ""That's not a very long time for looking at cardiovascular risk, because cardiovascular risk extends over many years,"" says Robert Myerburg, M.D., a professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

And despite being very large, the study may not have been big enough to detect small increases in risk, since heart attacks and other serious cardiovascular problems are relatively rare, says Philip Shaw, M.D., an ADHD researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. Indeed, only 2,228 of the study participants -- one-half of 1% -- experienced a heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac death. More than 1.5 million adults in the United States take stimulants, according to the study. Most take the drugs for ADHD, although doctors sometimes prescribe stimulants off-label for depression-related fatigue, narcolepsy, and other conditions. Health.com: Adult ADHD? Tips for increasing your focus . Although children with ADHD have received the lion's share of attention from researchers and public-health officials, adults accounted for one-third of all prescriptions for ADHD medications in 2005. A previous study by the same group of researchers found no link between ADHD drugs and serious cardiovascular events in children and young adults, Shaw notes in his editorial. People who take ADHD medications should continue to be aware of less serious side effects, such as insomnia and loss of appetite, Shaw says. But, he says, the study is ""very reassuring"" regarding cardiovascular risk.

"(CNN) -- The Arab television network Al Jazeera said Wednesday it has acquired Current TV, the U.S. network started by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The buy will give the network -- headquartered in Doha, Qatar -- greater access to the U.S. market. ""By acquiring Current TV, Al Jazeera will significantly expand our existing distribution footprint in the U.S., as well as increase our newsgathering and reporting efforts in America,"" Al Jazeera Director General Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani said in a news release. ""We look forward to working together with our new cable and satellite partners to serve our new audiences across the U.S."" The new channel, which will provide domestic and international news for a U.S. audience, will be based in New York, with plans to open up new bureaus across the United States and double the network's staff there to more than 300 employees, the network said. Current TV, co-founded by Gore and businessman Joel Hyatt in 2005, attracted more media attention than ratings in the U.S. with the hiring -- and subsequent firing -- of former MSNBC anchor Keith Olbermann and also the 2009 detention in North Korea of two Current TV journalists. Laura Ling and Euna Lee were arrested and tried in North Korea for illegal entry into the country but were pardoned after former U.S. President Bill Clinton intervened, traveling to North Korea to meet with former leader Kim Jong Il. ""We are proud and pleased that Al Jazeera, the award-winning international news organization, has bought Current TV,"" said Gore and Hyatt in a press release. ""Since its founding in 2005, Current has grown into a national network available in nearly 60 million homes, offering thought-provoking commentary and Emmy and Peabody award-winning programming. Current Media was built based on a few key goals: To give voice to those who are not typically heard; to speak truth to power; to provide independent and diverse points of view; and to tell the stories that no one else is telling. Al Jazeera, like Current, believes that facts and truth lead to a better understanding of the world around us."" But Current TV never found strong ratings in the U.S. cable market. For Al Jazeera, the deal will help give it stronger distribution in the U.S. Current is now available via cable and satellite TV through distribution partners Comcast, DirecTV and others. However, Time Warner Cable -- which runs Current TV in New York and Los Angeles -- has terminated its agreement with Current TV in the wake of the Al Jazeera deal.

"(CNN) -- Blanche Danick may be 86 years old, but she's pretty hip. She keeps up with all the latest health news, and a while back, she called her daughter wanting to know whether she should start taking the herb ginkgo biloba. She'd heard it might stave off Alzheimer's disease. ""I told her not to bother, that it wouldn't make much of a difference,"" says her daughter, Edythe London, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""On the basis of what I've read, I don't think it staves off dementia."" London's advice makes a lot of sense, according to a study out this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Ginkgo is a top-selling herb and has been hailed by some as a memory-booster, but the new University of Pittsburgh study found it didn't help prevent Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia in more than 3,000 elderly study subjects. Ginkgo manufacturers say this isn't the first -- or the last -- word on the herb. ""There is a significant body of scientific and clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of ginkgo extract for both cognitive function and improved circulation,"" said Mark Blumenthal, executive director of the American Botanical Council. London's still skeptical. ""But I do tell my mother there are other things she can do,"" says London, who's studied the brain and aging. ""I tell her to go out and do things and see people every day and be active."" Studies have shown that physical exercise, the kind that keeps the heart healthy, also keeps the brain healthy, according to the National Institutes of Health's Cognitive and Emotional Health Project. People are like rats, London says. ""If you put a rat in a cage by itself, it won't do well on cognitive tests. But if you give it toys and put other rats in its cage, they're going to be smarter rats."" In addition to playing with toys and hanging out with your fellow rats, here are five other tips for keeping your memory sharp. London says they help work on memory centers of the brain, including the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, identified in the diagram above. 1. Antioxidants . London makes sure her mother takes vitamins A, C, and E. They're antioxidants, which prevent cell damage and are believed by some to slow down diseases of aging. ""There are studies that suggest antioxidants might prevent dementia,"" she says. 2. Fish oil supplements . Dr. Gary Small, director of the UCLA Center on Aging, says aging brains show signs of inflammation, and fish oil has anti-inflammatory properties. 3. Phosphatidylserine supplements . Phosphatidylserine is a lipid found naturally in the body. Small says he's not 100 percent convinced these supplements will help stave off dementia, but they're worth a try. ""If I start having memory problems when I get older, I'll give them a trial run and see if they help,"" says Small, author of the new book ""iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind."" 4. Curry . Small, who's 57, says that as he gets older, he might also try eating more foods with curry in them. ""Some studies in Singapore show that those who ate curry once a week had better memory scores,"" he said. 5. Cross-training your brain . ""Our brains can be made stronger through exercise,"" says Andrew Carle, assistant professor of in the department of health administration and policy at George Mason University. ""In the same way physical exercise can delay many of the effects of aging on the body, there's some evidence cognitive exercise can at least delay the onset of Alzheimer's."" But Carle says it's not enough to do just one kind of brain exercise. ""Doing a crossword puzzle every day is good, but it's the equivalent of doing only pushups -- your arms will get strong, but not the rest of your body."" He recommends doing other activities in addition, such as computing numbers in your head instead of using a calculator, or using one of the ""brain gym"" computer games designed to enhance brain function. As for London, who's 60, she thinks her best bet at staving off dementia doesn't come in a bottle, or on a dinner plate, or in a computer game. ""I'm going to keep working on my research, and surround myself with young people, and do a lot of exercise,"" she says. ""I'm going to be a happy old lady. That in and of itself is going to do a lot of good for my brain.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Backers of a comprehensive new farm bill held a campaign-style rally Wednesday on Capitol Hill, cranking up the political heat on House Republican leaders struggling to balance competing election year and ideological pressures. ""All of us gathered here today ... share one common and resounding message,"" said Bob Stallman, head of the American Farm Bureau Federation. ""Congress, for our farm and ranch families, their communities and for our nation, pass the farm bill now."" Stallman was cheered by a boisterous crowd at the Capitol Reflecting Pool. ""We are out here to let our congressmen know it is important that they pass the farm bill,"" Julie Taylor, an independent voter from Indiana, told CNN. ""It is frustrating. ... Knowing that we don't know what to do or what to plan for is very difficult."" The driest season: Global drought causes major worries . House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN the House Republican leadership is still ""working with the Senate to see what can be done."" He conceded, however, that the ""timing is definitely short."" Kevin Smith, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he hopes the Senate will pass a livestock disaster aid bill previously approved by the House. He stressed that ""we are still discussing options on a farm bill extension."" The current five-year law establishing various levels of federal support for drought-stricken farmers and ranchers expires September 30. While the Democratic-run Senate passed a $969 billion replacement bill in June through a rare bipartisan 64-35 vote, numerous conservatives in the Republican-controlled House have balked at the overall price tag and spiraling cost of food stamps included in the measure. ""For conservatives like myself ... the real concern (is) that what is now a farm bill is really not that. It's a food stamp bill,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas. Farm Belt Republicans in tight political races this fall, however, are pushing hard for quick legislative action on a more traditional comprehensive deal. North Dakota Rep. Rick Berg, a freshman House Republican seeking to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad, said Wednesday his message to the House Republican leadership is simple: Get it done. ""We've got to get this done,"" Berg told CNN. ""This is what's wrong with Washington."" Berg refused to speculate about possible repercussions for his campaign if the House fails to act. Cafferty: Why is Congress so good at kicking the can down the road? ""This is about the farmers and ranchers in North Dakota,"" he said. ""The last thing we need to do is create this cloud of uncertainty that will happen if we don't get a long-term farm bill done."" The congressman expressed optimism that the House will be able to act over the next few weeks. ""In the legislative process they work best under deadline, and so I just think we need to keep pushing right now,"" he said. South Dakota Rep. Kristi Noem, a first-term Republican, told reporters at the rally she is ""disappointed"" that House GOP leaders haven't scheduled a floor vote on another five-year bill approved by the House Agriculture Committee. The committee's bill is broadly similar to the Senate plan. ""That has been a big disappointment for me,"" she said. Noem and Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, sent a letter to Cantor on Wednesday requesting a meeting to discuss the possibility of bringing a bill to the House floor for a vote by the full chamber. ""Whether members support or oppose the farm bill, we believe the House should be allowed to vote so that we can be held accountable to those we represent,"" the letter said. While the full House has supported short-term drought disaster relief, several prominent Democrats and Republicans have expressed concern about the economic fallout that may accompany a failure to enact a new long-term deal. ""If the farm bill is allowed to expire and things begin to unwind, we turn back the clock in rural America,"" said Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, head of the Senate Agriculture Committee and primary author of the Senate plan. Agricultural markets, Stabenow declared at the rally, would be in ""disarray"" without a comprehensive new law. ""It's absolutely crazy to even get close to something"" like that scenario, she said. Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, told the crowd more grassroots pressure will be needed in order to force the GOP leadership's hand before the end of the current Congress. So far ""the groundswell is not out there,"" he warned. ""This rally is a good starting point but what we need, what is going to change this, we need 100 or 200 calls from people in their districts to these members. That's what is going to change this."" ""If you don't do that, we're not going to get a farm bill,"" he said. ""It's that simple."" A number of conservative leaders want to wait until after the November election, at which point they hope full Republican control of Congress and the White House will allow them to draft a bill more in line with their ideological preferences. Farmer: 'It was the system that failed us' Rep. Tom McClintock, R-California, argued Wednesday that Congress ""shouldn't be subsidizing any product."" ""It has nothing to do with how much they're making or not making,"" he said at the panel discussion with Huelskamp. ""Prices convey an enormous wealth of information that is absolutely essential to consumers to make rational decisions in the marketplace."" For their part, top Senate Republicans have indicated support for a short-term extension if the Senate's five-year bill can't get through the House. ""I represent a state in which agriculture is important,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Tuesday. ""I don't believe that we ought to let the current farm bill expire if we're unable to at this point to pass a replacement."" The head of the House Agriculture Committee, Oklahoma GOP Rep. Frank Lucas, told CNN on Wednesday ""there's a growing probability"" that a one-year extension is ""the most practical thing."" ""I believe some kind of action will happen before we go home (for the campaign), and it's my intent to help to make it happen,"" he said. ""Something has to happen.""

"(CNN) -- One of the world's oldest sports may have lost its grip in the Olympic Games. The Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee announced Tuesday that it has recommended dropping wrestling from the Summer Games beginning in 2020. ""Wrestling will now join the seven shortlisted sports -- baseball/softball, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, wakeboarding and wushu -- vying for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program as an additional sport,"" the IOC said in a statement. The governing body for the sport in the United States was so appalled at the decision, it started a Facebook page, ""Keep Wrestling in the Olympics."" In a statement, USA Wrestling Chief Executive Officer Scott Blackmun said, ""It is important to remember that today's action is a recommendation, and we hope that there will be a meaningful opportunity to discuss the important role that wrestling plays in the sports landscape both in the United States and around the world."" At a meeting in Russia in May, representatives from the eight sports will make presentations for inclusion in the 2020 Games. The Executive Board will recommend one. The final word will come in a vote at the IOC's general session in Argentina in September. Whichever sport is chosen will join the 25 sports the IOC listed Tuesday as core sports for 2020: athletics (track and field), rowing, badminton, basketball, boxing, canoeing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, football (soccer), gymnastics, weightlifting, handball, field hockey, judo, swimming, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, tennis, table tennis, shooting, archery, triathlon, sailing and volleyball. Wrestling will be included in the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. Opponents of the decision also took to Twitter, posting to the hashtag #SaveOlympicWrestling. ""The IOC has found a way, besides alien invasion, to unite Americans, Russians and Iranians. Fight begins anew,"" tweeted K.J. Pilcher, a multimedia journalist in Iowa, a hotbed for the sport. Kurt Angle, who won an Olympic gold medal before becoming a professional wrestler, wrote, ""Show Your Love for the Sport. IOC Must Reverse Decision. Trend It Worldwide."" Others wondered how sports like equestrian and disciplines like race walking and rhythmic gymnastics survived. And as people are wont to do these days, they turned to the White House petition site, creating two asking the president to put pressure on the IOC to overturn its decision and one to boycott the Games if wrestling is not included. They each had fewer than 5,000 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon. Wrestling has been a part of all but one of the modern Olympic Games since their inception in 1896, missing only the 1900 Games in Paris. Indeed, the website for Rio 2016 cites wrestling as ""one of the longest practiced sports -- perhaps only losing to athletics."" ""There are records of fights dating back to 3000 BC, and the sport was part of the Olympic Games of Antiquity,"" the website says. The sport has been contested in two styles, Greco-Roman and freestyle, since the 1920 Games in Belgium. Seventy-two wrestling medals were awarded at the London Olympics last year. So why, with such a rich history, is wrestling fighting with wakeboarding and wushu for survival? ""In an effort to ensure the Olympic Games remain relevant to sports fans of all generations, the Olympic Programme Commission systematically reviews every sport following each edition of the Games,"" the IOC said in its statement Tuesday. ""Nonsense,"" said the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles, headquartered in Switzerland. The group says it represents wrestlers from 180 countries, including many where wrestling is the national sport and the only sport that gives athletes a route to participation in the Games. Federation officials will meet this week in Thailand to discuss the IOC's decision and how to make a case for wrestling at the May IOC Executive Board meeting. Meanwhile, on the message boards of TheMat.com, the official website of USA Wrestling, posters were calling the IOC decision the death of the sport in the U.S. ""You know what this means it is dead. What reasons do universities now have to keep programs that are not revenue sports that are not Olympic Sports,"" wrote one. ""The day of reckoning has arrived for our beautiful sport. What a sad, sad course of events,"" wrote another. But at least one poster saw some logic in the IOC's popularity reasoning and pointed at mixed martial arts, the combination of boxing, wrestling and martial arts that is drawing legions of new fans. ""It's time to join forces with mma, because of its growing world wide popularity, and secure our growth and future as an essential part of its makeup. If we do not make this connection, we present ourselves as a single, fringe sport on the outside of popular"" culture, one poster wrote. The host city for the 2020 Summer Games will be chosen in September. Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid are the finalists.

"(CNN) -- Forensic evidence found on property belonging to a missing California teenager led authorities to a man suspected of kidnapping and killing her, authorities said Tuesday. Sierra LaMar, 15, of Morgan Hill has been missing since March 16, when she left her mother's home to walk to her school bus stop. Monday night, police arrested Antolin Garcia-Torres, 21, also of Morgan Hill. He faces charges of murder and kidnapping in LaMar's disappearance. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told reporters Tuesday that investigators believe LaMar is dead, although they have not located her body. ""We continue to pray until she's found,"" LaMar's mother, Marlene, said Tuesday. ""Our search still is not going to end."" She implored Garcia-Torres to ""come forward and say where she is."" Smith said Garcia-Torres has not been forthcoming with authorities. ""We have gained some value from our interviews with him, but nothing substantive,"" she said. LaMar's purse and phone were found at different locations on the side of the road within two miles of the house. The purse had clothes neatly folded inside. Forensic evidence was found ""in multiple places"" on LaMar's possessions, Smith said. She would not divulge the nature of the evidence. Physical evidence also links LaMar to Garcia-Torres' vehicle, which was seized on April 7. Garcia-Torres was identified March 28 after forensic evidence was run through a law enforcement database, Smith said. Garcia-Torres was in the database because he had a prior felony arrest for an assault, although the case was not prosecuted, she said. Since then, authorities have had him until 24-hour surveillance, she said. ""We were hoping that he would lead us to where Sierra was."" The motive for the abduction is not known, she said, but ""it's my belief this was purely random. It was an absolute stranger abduction."" LaMar was ""a very social girl"" who was constantly in touch with her friends by telephone and through social media, she said. Since she was reported missing, she has contacted no one. In addition, some property found was items ""she would have taken with her, including medication,"" the sheriff said. Investigators believe Garcia-Torres acted alone, she said. ""These are very, very difficult cases, to prosecute a homicide when you have not found the victim, but it has been done and I think we have adequate facts, strong facts"" to show the teen is dead, Smith said. Authorities have not recovered a weapon and don't know how long LaMar might have been kept alive or how she died, she said. Forensic evidence has also linked Garcia-Torres to one of three unsolved assaults in Morgan Hill in March 2009, Smith said. In one assault, a stun gun was used on a victim who managed to escape; another victim had her own knife used against her; and in a third, a man tried to get into a woman's car but was unsuccessful when she locked it. Smith said she could not remember which of those three Garcia-Torres was linked to. In April, Marlene LaMar, described her daughter as a focused student who was a cheerleader. ""She was passionate,"" Marlene LaMar told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""She did dance, competitive dancing. And she also enjoyed cheerleading. She was driven. You know, she set the bar kind of high for herself as far as, you know, trying her best."" Morgan Hill is about 22 miles southeast of San Jose. ""We still need your support,"" the girl's father, Steve LaMar, told reporters Tuesday. ""We need to bring Sierra home. ... We want justice served. That's what we're looking for.""

"(CNN) -- Congolese rebels took control of the eastern city of Goma and part of the border with Rwanda on Tuesday after days of heavy clashes, a Congolese reporter there said. The rebels took control of the government radio station in Goma and were seen walking through town, entering government and police buildings, said the reporter, who could not be named for security reasons. The rebels are part of the M23 rebel group, which has been engaged in heavy fighting with Congolese army forces in the region since last Thursday. Though 1,500 United Nations peacekeeping troops are in Goma and have control of the airport there, a U.N. spokesman said the situation is at a ""critical stage."" ""Reports indicate that the M23 has wounded civilians, is continuing abductions of children and women, is destroying property and is intimidating journalists and those who have attempted to resist their control,"" said Eduardo del Buey, the deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general. A total of 6,000 troops from the U.N. mission in Congo, MONUSCO, are in the wider region of North and South Kivu, patrolling areas of particular insecurity, del Buey said. The United Nations, the African Union and countries in the region are demanding that M23 immediately stop its attacks, Buey said. France and Britain expressed their concerns Tuesday. The British Foreign Office said its minister for Africa, Mark Simmonds, was traveling to Rwanda, Congo, and Uganda to support efforts to end the crisis. ""I am deeply concerned by the current crisis and I urge the M23 to stop their offensive and for all external support to the M23 to cease,"" Simmonds said in a statement ahead of the visit. Read more: Rebel group advances in eastern Congo, nearing regional capital . The conflict spread over the border Tuesday when several shells hit Rwanda, killing two people and wounding several others, Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo told CNN. An M23 rebel spokesman, calling his group the Revolutionary Army of Congo, went on the radio Tuesday afternoon to address the people of Goma. Lt. Col. Vianey Kazarama said the group was there to protect the population and that people should return to work Wednesday. Any remaining pockets of the army should join the rebels or the M23 will fight against them, Kazarama said. He called on members of the police and army still in Goma to meet with the rebel leadership Wednesday morning to hand over their weapons and uniforms and join the rebels' cause. The group has already started recruiting new members at the police headquarters in Goma, according to the Congolese reporter on the scene. Several high-ranking government officials have fled Goma for nearby Bukavu, in South Kivu, U.N. officials and a senior NGO official said earlier Tuesday. The local Goma government could not be reached for comment. Nor could MONUSCO, which is mandated to protect civilians in Goma. Read more: Fighting worsens 'deteriorating' situation in eastern Congo . The eastern part of Congo, which includes Goma, has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals following the genocide. Soldiers from the M23 group were part of the national army as part of peace negotiations brokered in 2009. They broke away from the Congolese army in April, however, complaining of a lack of pay and poor conditions. One of its commanders, Bosco Ntaganda, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, including recruiting child soldiers. Security analysts say the rebellion in eastern Congo has dangerous regional implications, and the international community has expressed alarm at the M23 advances. British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned M23's advance into Goma and said anyone responsible for rights abuses would be held to account. ""The M23 must withdraw their forces immediately and allow legitimate government control to be restored. The cessation of hostilities and the protection of civilians is paramount,"" he said in a statement. The International Crisis Group, an independent anti-conflict non-profit group, warned that the fall of Goma could lead to serious human rights abuses against civilians. The settling of scores or even extrajudicial killing of members of the authorities and civil society activists who have opposed M23 could fuel further violence, it said. The unrest could also spread to neighboring communities and ""relaunch open warfare between the DRC and Rwanda,"" the group said on its website. The United Nations and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebel group by providing it with arms, support and even soldiers. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has repeatedly denied the allegation, and Mushikiwabo said Tuesday Rwanda has moved ""way past"" the accusations. Rwanda will not engage in any talks with M23, Mushikiwabo said. ""Our interlocutor is the government of the DRC,"" she said. Mushikiwabo said Rwanda would close the border crossing if asked to by the Congolese government, but that such a move could have humanitarian consequences. Tens of thousands of Congolese, already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region, have fled camps around the edges of Goma, according to UNICEF and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.

"(CNN) -- If the complexity of a country's tax structure has a direct correlation with non-payment, then Pakistan would win a gold medal. The South Asian country has no fewer than 37 government agencies levying more than 70 unique taxes on various goods and services -- the problem is only a fraction of the population ever pays it. At the latest count, just 800,000 of the country's 180 million people paid taxes, and its budget deficit stood at a massive $17 billion, according to government figures. Tactics designed to raise taxes have ranged from the standard - media campaigns aimed at getting shopkeepers to display their tax certificates, to the bizarre - groups of transvestites hired to 'shame' tax debtors into paying. Now Pakistan's National Data Base and Registration Authority (NADRA) has weighed into the problem of endemic non-payment with what it hopes will be a permanent solution. It aims to put every Pakistani adult into one of the world's largest multi-biometric databases. ""We have 452 static centers where people are coming and giving this data, we have 250 mobile vans, we have a motorcycle service, and we (even) have people up in the mountains -- skiers and mountaineers with man-pack units,"" says NADRA Chairman Tariq Malik whose mission it is to log every potential taxpayer in Pakistan. With half the population already registered under the scheme, it's a platform for paying out benefits, track ID fraud and to track down tax evaders. While the Pakistan tax system is riddled with exemptions -- for instance, only those who earn more than $3,500 a year, just 10 million people, are subject to income tax -- NADRA says there are plenty of avenues for raising revenue in a country where those who are eligible for taxes paid an average of just $130 a year. The department aims to start at the top, identifying people whose conspicuous consumption does not match their tax bill. ""He has two Mercedes Benzes, one Toyota SUV, 10 bank accounts. He travels frequently to the UK, to Abu Dhabi -- he has a lot of money, but he doesn't have a national tax number,"" says Malik, holding the file of one of 3.5 million people NADRA believes should be paying taxes. Pakistan's tax chief Ali Arshad Hakeem is calling for a tax amnesty with a difference -- a one-time payment with no questions asked about the past but a promise to file tax returns for the next four years. The aim is to bring people into the tax net for life. For those who still refuse, Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenues -- the main tax collection agency -- plans to get tough. ""We are going to block their ID cards, and we are going to block their bank accounts, and we are going to block their foreign travels until the either pay or file an appeal,"" says Hakeem. While the proposal has yet to become law, the hope is that the new measure will bring down the country's crippling deficit and its reliance on foreign loans. ""By not paying their taxes, developed Pakistanis are forcing poverty on the rest of the country,"" he said. Under the scheme, a one-off flat payment of 40,000 Pakistani rupees â€” just short of $420 â€” will wipe the slate clean for even lifelong tax evaders. ""We will issue notices to evaders after approval of the proposed law, and it will not be very difficult to hit them, as we have full data available about them, whether they are politicians, businessmen, cricketers or showbiz people,"" Hakeem told the Pakistani daily Dawn. Nevertheless, some senior analysts have criticized the scheme as a license to launder money, saying the government should simply crack down on evaders rather than give them breathing space. Pakistan's former chief economist, Ashfaque Hassan Khan, said the plan was unfair to those who did pay taxes and would encourage others to wait for similar amnesties in the future.","Pakistan has one of the highest rates of tax evasion in the world .

"(CNN) -- Life had not quite worked out the way Fuad Ibrahim had planned. A few years ago the whole world was laid out at the 21-year-old American striker's feet. Ibee, as he is known by his coaches and teammates, was considered one of the most naturally talented players ever to emerge in U.S. soccer. He was quickly brought into the national team set up, playing in every game at the Under-17 World Cup finals. At the age of 16 he was the second youngest player ever to be drafted into the MLS. Perhaps prophetically, the youngest was Freddy Adu, a name that has become a euphemism for talent unfulfilled. Luck, nerve, injury, temperament: no one could explain Ibee's decline after being called up to the U.S. Under-20 squad. But decline he did as he went from Dallas to Toronto and then to his hometown club, the Minnesota Stars in the NASL -- the second tier of U.S. soccer. The decline appeared terminal when he was released at the end of last season.. And then out of the blue an email arrived from the country of his birth -- Ethiopia. ""It said that Ethiopia would like to invite me to play for the national team,"" Ibee told CNN, speaking from his hotel room in the capital Addis Ababa. Africa calling . Ibee had left Ethiopia with his parents when he was eight. He only remembers blurry snippets from his life there, while he does not speak much of the language, just a few words and phrases. He still does not know quite what to make of how things have turned out. His entire life had been geared towards one day playing for the full U.S. men's national team. Now there was another potential future on the Horn of Africa. ""I didn't think they wanted me to go right away but then they kept emailing me,"" added Ibee. ""Eventually I replied back, thinking it might be something for the future. A couple of times we had contact over the phone. Then I realized they were serious."" Soon Ibee was flying to the high altitude of Addis Ababa and into Ethiopia's squad for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, a biennial tournament considered one of the toughest, and most entertaining in world soccer. The Story of Libya's Rebel Soccer Team . Ethiopia had once been champions of Africa. But a devastating series of famines and wars killed millions of people in the 1970s and 80s. Soccer took a back seat until last year when the Walya Antelopes came from nowhere to qualify for their first Africa Cup of Nations in 31 years. Coach Sewnet Bishaw has masterminded their shock qualification -- Ethiopia having somehow made it through after losing 5-3 against Sudan in their first match. But Bishaw knew that, in a continent that provides some of the best players to the best clubs in the world -- with top African players playing for the likes of Real Madrid, Chelsea and Barcelona -- experience in foreign leagues would be needed. Eventually that trawl led to the MLS and to Ibee, who was handed his first start in a warm-up match against Tanzania. He scored. ""It was a special moment to score,"" Ibee said of his first-half strike in a 2-1 victory. ""It will live with me for the rest of my life."" A Minnesota winter . After emigrating to the U.S. the Ibrahim family settled in the wintry climes of Minnesota. His father made a living at a driving school, while Ibee soon discovered that he had a talent at soccer. ""It was the United States, the land of opportunity, so it was a chance to be raised in a better environment to have that opportunity in life,"" he said of the family's reasons for emigrating. ""But for any kid growing up in Africa, soccer is the first sport they play. I was never really serious but I started playing club teams, I was doing good and realized I should stick with it ... everything for me then was all about playing for the States."" He tried his hand briefly at American football -- as a kicker his record for a field goal was 34 yards -- but soccer was always his first love. It was after Ibrahim had been called up to the MLS residency program at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida that Ibee started to dream of the world stage. ""I always wanted to play for the US national team,"" he said. ""I got an Under-15 invite to stay in Florida and from day one it was special, playing pre-season against MLS teams. I realized I could make it. We were already playing professional teams. I thought, I could be there one day. I wouldn't be where I was today if wasn't for U.S. soccer."" Ibee graduated seamlessly through U.S. soccer's national youth teams, playing at the Under-17 World Cup in South Korea before being called up to the Under-20 team, the last step before becoming a full international. ""Ibee was one of the most talented players to come through the U.S. Under-17 and 20 teams,"" said Thomas Rongen, the current youth academy director at Toronto, who was coach of the Under -20 U.S. national team at the time. ""But [he] was not able to make the step to the highest level. [Ibee] signed as one of the youngest players in the history of MLS, only Freddy Adu was younger. Technically very sound ... but [he] was not able to adapt to the professional game at the highest level."" The next big thing? What went wrong? ""I'll be honest, I didn't have any injury when I was at Toronto and I'm not someone to blame other people for things in the past,"" explained Ibee. ""I was doing good but as time goes, growing up with so many coaches -- Toronto FC has had eight coaches in five years -- it effected my playing time. ""When a new coach came in I'd get a rhythm, they'd get fired and then a new one came in. All of a sudden you have to rebuild trust. It kind of kept happening."" After Toronto Ibee tried to get his big break in Europe, but that did not work out either. ""I was here and there in Austria and Denmark. I didn't find a place where I really fitted in. It didn't go the way I wanted. But this is life. You have to live with it and learn."" Then came the call from Ethiopia. ""The weather was very difficult especially coming from the cold and suddenly I'm in high altitude,"" he said of his arrival in Adidis Ababa, whichat 2,355 meters above sea level is the fifth highest capital city in the world. ""It was tough in the first week. But I've got used to it. It was time to play for my country, the country I was born in."" Young Americans . Ibee is not the only American soccer player that has made the move to a different national team. During qualification for the 2014 World Cup, national teams from Haiti, Palestine and Afghanistan, among others, have scoured U.S. soccer's talent network looking for second and third generation immigrants to bolster their teams. An American Soccer Star Playing For Palestine . ""There are a growing number of Americans playing for other national teams but it's almost a second choice,"" said Brian Sciaretta, a New York Times blogger, who runs Yanks Abroad, a website detailing the foreign adventures of American soccer players. He has seen a huge number of players coming through the U.S. system before turning up in the most unlikely of places from Ethiopia to Tajikistan. As many as 400 play in Europe alone. ""There's so many different ethnically diverse people in the States. Soccer is new but we've always been athletic people. We have state-of-the-art fitness and dieting. It's quite attractive to foreign coaches,"" he said. ""If soccer can make it work in this country it could have revolutionary effect on global football."" Now Ibee has the chance to put his career back on track. Currently a free agent, a good Africa Cup of Nations could secure him a contract back in the U.S. or even in Europe. First there is the task of negotiating a tough group containing reigning champions Zambia, former champions Nigeria and Burkina Faso. ""Technically they are very, very talented,"" Ibee said of his teammates. Although he cannot speak Amharic, he communicates with Bisaw in English. ""They have a different style of playing. They can shock anybody. No one thought Zambia would win the Africa Cup of Nations last year but they shocked everybody."" Shop window . True life did not quite work out as expected for Fuad Ibrahim. But sometimes that is not necessarily a bad thing. Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger recently argued that the Africa Cup of Nations is the last tournament in world football where unknown players and teams can emerge to be stars. ""This time in South Africa you will have Ethiopia,"" he said. ""If I ask you to name five Ethiopian players, I am sure you will have a problem."" Wenger's quotes have been used by Bishaw to motivate his team further. But the chance to play against some of the best players in the world, and get his career back on track, is motivation enough for Ibee. ""It's a great opportunity for me,"" he said. ""Soccer can change the the way rest of the world view Ethiopia and Ethiopian soccer. After the goal I scored people recognize me in the street. I hope I do that on the big stage."" ""Only God knows. I'll leave it up to God.""","This weekend sees the start of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- The holiday shopping season might be over in the West, but in Asia, international brands are hoping to cash in on the Chinese New Year with products commemorating the year of the dragon. Luxe brands including Rolls Royce, Piaget, Versace and Michael Kors are tapping into the growing appetite for brand-name goods among China's upper middle class, which accounts for about 12% of the global luxury goods market, according to a 2011 McKinsey report. With that share expected to grow to 22% by 2015, the timing couldn't be better. Much of luxury's allure comes from the opportunity to share in the cultural heritage associated with a brand, the McKinsey report found. A revered symbol of good luck and prosperity, the dragon lends itself to bold imagery in jewelry, cars, even coffee makers. Watchmaker Piaget created more than 20 pieces exclusively for its Dragon and Phoenix line, which honors the dragon and its mythical mate. Items from the collection range from $25,000 to north of $100,000 for its Altiplano Double Jeu, a 43 mm watch in 18-carat white gold set with 78 cut diamonds, with an enamel dial and a white alligator strap. Shanghai Tang incorporates the dragon motif in its Nespresso Dragon Collection, which includes a shiny red coffee maker, a box to hold Nespresso coffee capsules and a cup-and-saucer set. Instead of starting from scratch, Rolls Royce's Bespoke Team incorporated imagery and colors of the year of the dragon to put a new spin on its classic Phantom automobile. While most of the lines are available only in Asia, dragon enthusiasts in the Western Hemisphere need not despair -- products including Burberry's red Dragon Collection and Tiffany's Chinese zodiac charms are available in the United States. There's even a market for those who don't have thousands of dollars to spare on a gimmick. Just $18 can get you a Hello Kitty 2012 Year of the Dragon gold compact from cosmetics dealer Sephora. Going a bit upmarket, Cartier has Happy New Year stationery in a dragon motif for $75.","International brands use year of the dragon to tap into China's growing market for luxury items .

"(CNN) -- Juventus took a giant step towards the quarterfinals of the European Champions League following a crushing 3-0 win over Celtic. Alesandro Matri's early strike and further goals from Claudio Marchisio and Mirko Vucinic completed a perfect night's work for the Italian champions. There was also success for Paris Saint-Germain, which claimed a 2-1 away win at Valencia, although it must do without star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the second leg after he was shown a straight red card. Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore had given the French club a two goal lead at the break, but Adil Rami's late strike and Ibrahimovic's dismissal means its all to play for in the French capital in three weeks time. Lisbon Lions . While PSG might still have to sweat, no such problems are expected for Serie A leaders and two-time European Cup winners Juventus. Dressed in all black and surrounded by the cauldron of Celtic Park, Juventus headed out to face one of the most intimidating atmospheres in European football. With the majority of the 57,917 crowd clad in green and white bellowing out their support for the Scottish champion, it was clear that this night was something special. Back in the knockout phase for the first time in five years, Celtic was dreaming of the glory days when it ruled the continent following its legendary cup final win of 1967. The victory over the might of Inter Milan in Lisbon, led to the team, which was to become known as the 'Lisbon Lions', becoming the first non-Latin side to win the trophy. Managed by the legendary Jock Stein, all of the players were born within a 30 mile radius of Glasgow. On May 24 1967, Lisbon was overrun with the green and white of Celtic and not that of local club Sporting. Goals from Tommy Gemmel and Stevie Chalmers secured victory over an Inter side which had won three of the four past editions of the competition. ""There is not a prouder man on God's Earth than me at this moment,"" said Stein following the triumph. ""Winning was important, but it was the way that we won that has filled me with satisfaction. ""We did it by playing football; pure, beautiful, inventive football. There was not a negative thought in our heads."" That night in Lisbon is never far from memory whenever the words 'Europe' and 'Celtic' are mentioned in the same breath. They are synonomous. The success of the past generation is a reminder of how Celtic became the first British club to win the competition, a fact which supporters are quick to point out at every opportunity. But while it has dominated domestically in recent years, helped by the downfall of fierce rival Glasgow Rangers, success in Europe has been more difficult to achieve. Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United: Which is the biggest club? Not since it lost to Porto in the 2003 UEFA Cup final had Celtic hit the European headlines, that was until this year and its shock victory over Barcelona. A 2-1 home win against the La Liga champions helped Neil Lennon's side qualify for the last-16 and a meeting with Juventus. While the visitor appeared favorite on paper, Celtic's home form in the Champions League has been nothing short of remarkable. In its 23 matches before welcoming Juventus, Celtic had suffered just two defeats, while winning 15 and drawing six. With the second leg in Turin on March 6 to come, the home side would have hoped to secure a result in a bid to keep the tie alive. The atmosphere suggested a gladiatorial arena, the bloodcurdling noise of Celtic Park rose as the players emerged. This was Celtic's time. Foreign owners in UK football: The good the bad and the ugly . Or perhaps not. Instead, it took Juventus just three minutes to silence one of European football's most intimidating arenas. On Sunday, Efe Ambrose was celebrating Nigeria's victory in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations -- but on a freezing February night in Glasgow he was left to rue a horrendous defensive error. It was his mistake which allowed Federico Peluso's long ball to release Alessandro Matri and the striker fired home, despite Kelvin Wilson trying to clear off the line. The shock and horror was etched across the faces of the Celtic players, but slowly and surely, those emblazoned with the green and white began to show its famous spirit. Kris Commons came agonizingly close to an equalizer when his overhead kick sailed just inches wide of the far post, while Ambrose should have netted with a free header just after the hour mark. That miss was to be severely punished as Juventus wrapped the game up with 13 minutes remaining when Matri released Marchisio, who turned Scott Brown and slotted the ball home. Worse was to come for Celtic with 83 minutes on the clock when Ambrose, who only returned from South Africa on Tuesday morning, gave away possession and Vucinic raced in to score. ""We need a miracle,"" Celtic manager Lennon told ITV. ""But it's the harsh reality of Champions League football and some of my young players will learn a huge lesson tonight. ""I thought for 70-odd minutes, until the second goal, we were by far the better side -- but you can't give away goals like we gave away, sloppy."" How Manchester United tried to drown the stars of Real Madrid in 1957 . On a day when wrestling was dropped from the Olympics, Lennon was frustrated with the way Juventus' defenders manhandled his players at set-pieces. Time and time again, defender Stephane Lichtsteiner was grappling with Gary Hooper and Scott Brown inside the penalty area, but nothing was forthcoming from referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco. ""I'd like to ask the referee, is the game different in Spain or Italy?"" Lennon said. ""Every time one of my players tried to move he was held. He should have given a penalty on at least two occasions."" Big spending masks age of austerity for top soccer clubs . While that win all but secures Juventus' place in the last eight, PSG faces a more difficult proposition following an infuriatingly frustrating second half performance. In front of a watching David Beckham, who is hoping to make his debut within the next few weeks, PSG showed why they should be feared in this year's competition. Leading 2-0 thanks to goals from Lavezzi and Pastore, Carlo Ancelotti's men missed several golden opportunities and could have easily scored four or five at the Mestalla. Lavezzi, who has now scored in each of his past three Champions League games, should have had a hat-trick only to miss two simple chances. Beckham to donate PSG wages to children's charity . That wastefulness was punished in the final minute when Rami bundled home from close range to give the home side hope. The tie then took another twist when Ibrahimovic was shown a straight red card for a controversial studs up challenge on Andres Guardado. ""Ibrahimovic did not deserve the red card. I don't understand the decision,"" Ancelotti told French Canal Plus television at full time. ""We played well and had chances to score more goals. It was a good team performance, but this was just the first leg. There is still the return to come.""","Juventus claims 3-0 win at Celtic in first leg of last-16 tie .
