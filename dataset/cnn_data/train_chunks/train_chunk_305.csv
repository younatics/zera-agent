"(CNN) -- The NYPD is investigating how two American flags that fly at the top of the Brooklyn Bridge were replaced by two white flags. The swapped-out flags were spotted by construction workers at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence John Miller said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. He said members of the Emergency Service Unit found two flags, one on each tower of the bridge, that appeared to be American flags that had been bleached white. The workers also found large aluminum pans affixed as covers over the lights and secured with zip ties, Miller added. The NYPD's Counter-Terror Bureau, the Intelligence Division and the Emergency Service Unit were on the bridge as the white flags were removed, according to an NYPD detective. ""At this time, it appears it has no particular nexus to terrorism or even politics,"" Miller said. ""This may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at making some kind of statement, but at this point it's not clear what that statement is."" NYPD Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called the incident a matter of concern and said that police are requesting the help of the public as they continue to look across social media for claims of responsibility. Miller said that the NYPD has video that shows a number of people crossing the bridge just after 3 a.m. Tuesday and within the hour, the light that normally illuminates the flag on the Brooklyn side of the bridge flickered and appeared to go out and a few minutes later the same thing occurred on the Manhattan tower. Miller added that he believes the bleached flags were made at home and that whoever did this might have had some climbing or construction experience. ""There is a standard level of security at the bridge; apparently that security failed this morning or last night. Perhaps more security is needed,"" a NYPD detective familiar with the investigation said. Miller said that there are two NYPD vehicles at each end of the bridge at all times, and after the news conference told reporters that the department is looking at putting NYPD cameras on the bridge. Should the incident just prove to be a stunt, some people don't find the humor. ""If flying a white flag atop the Brooklyn Bridge is someone's idea of a joke, I'm not laughing,"" Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said in a statement. ""The public safety of our city is of paramount importance, particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high-risk targets."" Adams announced at a news conference Tuesday that he is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to the arrest of the person or people responsible. New York City Councilman Mark Weprin tweeted a photo of the flags Tuesday morning. ""I drive over the Brooklyn Bridge often, I thought, what the heck is that about?"" Weprin told CNN. ""I'm curious and I'm also concerned if it was vandals."" The Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883 and at that time was the longest suspension bridge, according to the Department of Transportation. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service, and a New York City Landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. CNN's Sonia Moghe and David Shortell contributed to this report.","Mysterious white flags are spotted atop the Brooklyn Bridge rush hour Tuesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- With the architect of the September 11, 2001, attacks dead, U.S. commandos in Osama bin Laden's Pakistan compound quickly came upon another prize: A trove of hard drives, DVDs and thumb drives that might provide evidence of other al Qaeda operations. Those materials, seized after bin Laden and four others were killed, have provided the first specific alert to come out of Monday's raid. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a notice tied to rail security Thursday. The unclassified notice to ""federal, state, local and tribal partners"" says that, in February 2010, al Qaeda members discussed a plan to derail trains in the United States by placing obstructions on tracks, according to a law enforcement source who received the notice. Pakistan reacts angrily to tone of U.S. questions . The plan was to be executed this fall to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. But no specific city or rail system was identified in the notice, the source told CNN. Although a U.S. official cautioned that the information doesn't appear to suggest an imminent plot against U.S rail systems, the discovery may be the tip of the iceberg of potential plots. The haul included ""lots"" of paper documents, 10 hard drives, five computers and more than 100 storage devices, such as disks, DVDs and thumb drives, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday. Since Monday, intelligence experts and others have pored over the find. A task force was set up at the CIA to comb through the evidence seized in the raid, according to a senior intelligence official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. More details emerge about the raid . At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said of evidence taken from the residence, ""As we glean information from that material, we will make appropriate decisions with regard to who might we add to the terrorist watch list, the no-fly list, all those things."" The U.S. official who spoke Thursday of the data said, ""We take every possible threat seriously, so we are running all of this to ground."" When asked if there were any indications that bin Laden had signed off on the rail operation, the official said, ""There is no information to suggest that there was some kind of 'blessed operation' attached to U.S transportation systems."" The same U.S. official says the al Qaeda scheme, which included derailing trains over bridges and valleys, ""doesn't appear to be anything more than an idea on paper at this point."" Material also indicated that al Qaeda was particularly interested in targeting cities -- Washington, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, the official said. Authorities sifting through the material learned al Qaeda has considered striking on significant dates such as July 4, Christmas and the opening day of the United Nations, according to the official. Osama's wife: We lived there 5 years . Department of Homeland Security spokesman Matt Chandler echoed the belief that there was no imminent threat to the rail system. But officials ""wanted to make our partners aware of the alleged plotting,"" he said. ""We want to stress that this alleged al Qaeda plotting is based on initial reporting, which is often misleading or inaccurate and subject to change."" Since Sunday, Chandler said, the department and other agencies have reviewed potential terror targets and deployed additional officers to nonsecured areas at U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told federal lawmakers Wednesday a ""number of actions"" have been taken in response to the killing of bin Laden, among them ""surging some resources"" to U.S. ports, airports and borders. ""These include issuing advisories to fusion center directors, Homeland Security advisers, major city chief intelligence commanders, private sector critical infrastructure owners and operators and other law enforcement entities,"" she said at a Senate hearing. ""We are and have been reviewing all open cases of potential al Qaeda core, AQAP (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) and AQIM (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) operatives possibly in the U.S. in conjunction with the FBI,"" she added. Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut independent who is chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, asked Napolitano about the data removed by the Navy SEALs from the bin Laden compound. ""I assume that as this material is gone over, anything related to Homeland Security will be shared immediately with your department?"" he asked. Napolitano responded, ""It is being shared (already)."" Earlier this week, former CIA Director Michael Hayden told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that the ""diffuse"" nature of al Qaeda is among its strengths. ""Keep in mind this is a network, not a hierarchy,"" Hayden said. ""So you've got still very active, very talented cells around the world."" CNN Homeland Security Correspondent Jeanne Meserve and Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","Homeland Security releases notice over rail system .

"Washington (CNN) -- The nuclear talks with the P5+1 -- that's France, Britain, Russia, China, the United States and Germany -- this past week in Geneva left much to be desired for Iran in terms of final outcomes. The joint action plan calls on Iran to take steps to verify the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. In return, it receives limited sanctions relief until a comprehensive solution within the year takes shape. But a deal is better than no deal as far as Tehran is concerned, and here is why: . The move preempts other power centers in Iran. Although President Hassan Rouhani rejected the idea, in the joint plan Tehran admitted de facto that its nuclear program might be in non-compliance. The move preempts hardline factions in Iran from attempts to advance know-how to build a nuclear bomb. It wants a dignified solution. Despite frequent proclamations to the contrary, Tehran will commit to talks until a way out of the nuclear dilemma is found, even if a final deal takes a long while to make. Until then, it can showcase its praiseworthy diplomatic skills. It wants the military option permanently off table. If Iran needs nuclear energy and has the capacity to produce the fuel, then an agreement that allows it to enrich nuclear fuel is not only necessary, but also reduces the chance of a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. That is why it insists on enrichment. It wants to fortify the conservative power-base. Without a deal, that prospect is in jeopardy because rival political factions in Iran will undermine Rouhani's conservative camp. Already, the joint action plan has come under attack by hardline sources who told Raja News, linked to former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, that it degrades Iran's nuclear rights. It wants to re-define ""Death to America."" Tehran can't control those chants. They aim to sabotage talks but also bring tactical pressure on the P5+1 to deliver on its end of the bargain. Tehran wants talks to move forward regardless. That is why Interior Minister Abdul Reza Rahmani Fazli told Mehr news agency that the chant means Iran supports talks. While that surely confuses any American, the vast majority of Iranians rejoice in what is implied, that Tehran is ready for a deal with the enemy. It wants to keep hardliners happy. There is a national consensus to resolve the nuclear crisis, according to hardline papers Kayhan and Sobh-e Sadeqh. To reciprocate the favor, Tehran hasn't rejected their calls to exercise ""resistance diplomacy,"" a term branded to push Tehran to remain defiant in the nuclear talks. Tehran paid lip-service to the cause while it advanced the talks. That means it knows it must ""eat bread based on its daily currency,"" to be able to ""tie the devil's hand behind its back,"" as two Persian proverbs go. It wants sanctions lifted. A deal which revamps Iran's economy and generates hard cash is a good one, even if it happens slowly. The head of Iran's Foreign Policy and National Security Commission Alaadin Boroujerdi told ISNA news agency the country will stick with talks until all sanctions are lifted, which the joint plan promises to do through a later comprehensive solution. He also told Fars news agency that parliament will make the endorsement of decisions with the P5+1 conditional on removing sanctions. It wants its three-tier proposal to get a fair chance. The action plan reflects some of the language of the Iranian proposal which was presented and ignored early this month in Geneva. This includes recognizing a step-by-step process to end the nuclear dispute, and the reversibility of an agreement if all its provisions are not fully met. This proposal gives Tehran and other parties a chance to step back and weigh new options if progress in talks falls short of expectations. It wants a deal before the next U.S. presidential race. Tehran does not want to rush talks in order to maximize the advantages of a final deal. But it knows the best opportunity for a good deal is until next November when campaigning for the 2016 presidential election can knock other priorities down the list. Although it risks tying the fate of the nuclear talks to its relations with the U.S., Tehran is prepared to take that chance. That is why, in an interview with Tehran-based ISNA, its Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said he was ready for the next round of talks to begin right away. It wants to activate its regional diplomacy. Tehran de-linked the nuclear talks from other regional issues including Syria, but remained open to discussing them with the P5+1. It paid the price and ignored its neighbors in the process, including Saudi Arabia and Israel who have stakes in Syria, for a higher gain: to limit the impact of its conflicts in the region on its nuclear file. With an initial plan now in place, Tehran can revamp its regional diplomacy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Banafsheh Keynoush.","Banafsheh Keynoush: Iran has many things to gain .
She says it can help keep various sides in Iran happy .
It limits nuclear weapon development at home .

"(CNN) -- When White House press secretary Josh Earnest said this week that President Barack Obama had ""substantially improved the tranquillity of the global community,"" many observers reacted with disbelief. When the President refused to go to the U.S.-Mexico border last week to see the crisis of young people flooding into the United States because ""he's not interested in photo ops,"" lesser mortals noted he had played pool with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, dropped by a brewery to have a beer and shook hands with a man wearing a horse-head mask. When he went to Delaware on Thursday and opened with a few sentences about the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner in Ukraine before joking about Joe Biden and going back to his prepared text on infrastructure, many thought he had failed to take seriously an international disaster. They were even less impressed when he had lunch at the Charcoal Pit and ordered burgers and fries (not a photo op, of course). It was not until 24 hours later that he took to the podium to promise an aggressive investigation. With the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria causing the collapse of Iraq and continued violence in Syria, the Syrian dictatorship consolidating its power, the Iranians failing to take steps to end their nuclear weapons program and Hamas firing more than 1,000 rockets at Israel, the President and his team have moved decisively to brief The New York Times on his passion for late-night intellectual dinners exploring physics, architecture and questions far more profound than the fate of the Middle East. It is as though the more dangerous the world becomes the more Obama hides in a fantasy world of avoiding the responsibilities of the presidency. He uses the office to surround himself with court jesters who distract him in an enlightened and noble way from the growing failures of his policies and the rapidly expanding threats to the civilized world. Finally, as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to flex his muscles and expand his policies, there is a psychologically bizarre pattern of the President's staff referring to Obama as ""the Bear."" The President refers to himself when he asserts ""the Bear is loose."" Of course with a President who last week used ""I"", ""my"" or ""mine"" 207 times in one speech, the concept is beyond bizarre. The White House staff, thinking somehow that this was clever, promptly turned the phrase into a Twitter hashtag, #TheBearIsLoose. Obama's idea of a loose bear is an unplanned walk to a Starbucks near the White House. Putin's idea of a loose bear is stealing Crimea. Obama's idea of risk-taking is shooting pool with a Democratic governor. Putin's idea of risk-taking is handing out anti-aircraft missiles to rebels in Ukraine. Putin's actions remind us of a time when America was threatened by a real metaphorical bear, as a 1984 Reagan campaign ad referred to the Soviet Union. The self-image of Obama as a bear is so delusional that it brings into question the degree to which he is simply out of touch with reality. Which brings us back to Earnest's quote about tranquillity in the international community. What he's channeling is Obama's personal tranquillity. From his perch in the amazingly Obama-centric world in which our President lives, look again at what the rest of us think of as serious problems. Have any of the 1,000-plus Hamas rockets been aimed at Obama? No. That is why Obama is tranquil. Have any of the thousands who are crossing the border tried to move into the White House? No. That is why Obama is tranquil. Is ISIS an immediate threat to the United States that is likely to blow up the next golf course the President is playing at? No. That is why Obama is tranquil. If you can reduce your presidency to a Starbucks visit, a man with a horse-head mask, shooting pool and visiting Joe Biden's burger joint for lunch, you can have a successful presidency as you have defined it, even if the world is disintegrating. The President's detachment from reality is fast infecting the rest of his party. How else can we explain fellow Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stating this week that ""the border is secure""? This ""tranquillity"" line was a Freudian slip by the President's spokesman that reveals the deep gap between reality and the Obama White House. Obama is rapidly becoming the weakest president since James Buchanan failed to stop the drift toward Civil War. Self-delusion and a rich fantasy life are dangerous in a president. They often lead to disasters that are unimaginable until they happen. That is what we have to worry about for the next two years until he leaves public office for a private fantasyland.

"(CNN) -- ""Like the smell of a brand-new car"" were the words of International Space Station astronaut Don Pettit on Saturday after he carefully opened the hatch and entered the Dragon capsule for his first glimpse inside. Dragon connected with the station Friday, making history as the first private capsule to reach the orbiting spacecraft. Pettit opened the hatch at 5:53 a.m. ET with Russian cosmonaut and station commander Oleg Kononenko by his side. The two men, wearing T-shirts, khaki shorts, goggles and masks gave the thumbs up to the camera after they floated inside. The initial inspection went smoothly and ahead of schedule and the interior looked good, according to SpaceX, the private company that built and operates the Dragon. Pettit later told reporters in a briefing from space that the interior is roomier than the Russian Soyuz capsule that carried him to the space station. He said ""it looks like it carries about as much cargo as I could put in my pickup truck."" Ashes of 'Star Trek' actor on private rocket . Dragon delivered more than 1,000 pounds of cargo, including food, clothing, computer equipment and supplies for science experiments. After the crew unloads that cargo, they will reload the capsule with experiments and cargo for its return trip to Earth. Dragon is scheduled to splash into the Pacific Ocean several hundred miles west of California on May 31, according to NASA. Pettit said the crew has packed most of what its plan to send back to Earth, which includes everything from trash to scientific research and experimental samples. SpaceX Dragon triumph: Only the beginning . Dragon launched Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. NASA collaborated with SpaceX on every part of the mission and gave final authorization for the flight. Dragon reached the station Friday and was ""captured"" by the station's robotic arm just before 10 a.m. ET. Over the next two hours, the crew maneuvered the arm to bring the capsule in to berth and attach it to the station. The mission, hailed by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden as a step toward a new future of private innovation in the space industry, comes as government funding of the space program decreases. It also marked the culmination of six years of preparation to bring commercial flights to the space station after the retirement of NASA's space shuttle fleet last year, which leaves the United States with no means of independently sending humans into space. NASA relies on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit. Without the shuttle, the United States also has limited capabilities to send supplies to the station and bring them back. Dragon fills a need in taking significant payload back and forth, Pettit said. In December 2008, NASA announced it had chosen SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft to resupply the International Space Station after the shuttle's retirement. The $1.6 billion contract involves a minimum of 12 flights, with an option to order more missions for additional cost, according to SpaceX. SpaceX was created by PayPal founder Elon Musk and is one of a few of private companies receiving NASA funds to develop the commercial transport of astronauts into space. Musk has said the commercial program -- with fixed-price, pay-for-performance contracts -- makes fiscal sense for taxpayers and fosters competition among companies on reliability, capability and cost. Astronaut Joe Acaba, also aboard the space station, called the mission a great first step in the commercialization of spaceflight, and Pettit agreed. ""Commercial spaceflight will blossom due to its own merits, and doesn't really hinge on one mission,"" Pettit said. ""It will hinge on the viability of launching many missions over a long period of time and being able to provide useful commercial goods and services in the low-earth orbit arena."" SpaceX is now developing a heavy-lift rocket with twice the cargo capability of the space shuttle and hopes to build a spacecraft that could carry a crew to Mars.","NEW: Astronaut says the interior is roomier than the Soyuz .

"(CNN) -- Early data shows space shuttle Atlantis, poised for launch Friday, escaped damage from two lightning strikes Thursday afternoon, NASA said. One bolt emanating from a severe thunderstorm struck a water tower 515 feet from the pad; the second struck the beach nearby, the space agency said in a statement. Currently, the launch time of 11:26 a.m. Friday remains unchanged, despite only a 30% chance of favorable weather, according to NASA. Fueling was scheduled to start at 2:01 a.m. Friday. Ahead of that, engineers will determine whether the lightning affected systems, the external tank, main engines or other components. Atlantis is poised to perform the last mission of the 30-year-old shuttle program. On board will be a four-person, veteran crew of astronauts, headed to the international space station with a load of supplies.","NEW: NASA finds no damage after lightning strikes .

"(CNN) -- IMG, the behemoth sports management agency that represents three of tennis' biggest stars in Maria Sharapova, Novak Djokovic and Li Na, is no longer working with controversial Australian Bernard Tomic. IMG said in a tweet Wednesday that it ""mutually ended"" its relationship with the 21-year-old, days after the Sports Business Journal reported the sides were going their separate ways before their contract expired. When asked for confirmation that the contract was cut short, IMG didn't immediately respond and an interview request made to the ATP early morning Bogota time for Tomic wasn't immediately returned. Tomic is competing at a tournament in Bogota. CNN understands that the Tomic camp has approached his former agent, Lawrence Frankopan, who is now at StarWing Sports. StarWing Sports represents, among others, Chris Evert and 2014 Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka. Daniel Kaplan, a reporter with the SBJ, tweeted that IMG ""appears 2 have had enough"" with Tomic. Tomic had multiple hip surgery this year and his ranking has fallen almost 100 spots to 124th in two years but he -- and his father -- have repeatedly made headlines for their indiscretions. His father John was found guilty of assaulting Tomic's former hitting partner and last year handed a suspended eight-month sentence. The player himself was on the wrong end of the quickest loss -- not including retirements -- in recorded ATP history when he was pummeled by Jarkko Nieminen in 28 minutes in Miami in March; he has also been caught speeding more than once. He's been accused of tanking (or not trying in matches); was pictured topless receiving a lapdance in November; and booed when he retired against Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open in January. Police had to be called late in 2012 when Tomic and another man were fighting outdoors in an apartment complex. IMG and other agencies were attracted to Tomic while he was a junior, given his eye-catching results. And his stature grew when he in 2011 became the youngest man since Boris Becker 25 years earlier to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals. But Tomic isn't Australia's top hope now, replaced by the man who beat Nadal at Wimbledon, 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios.","Management agency IMG and Bernard Tomic mutually end their partnership .

"(CNN) -- A 4.2-magnitude earthquake struck near Guthrie, Oklahoma, at 7:41 a.m. CT (8:41 a.m. ET) Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Some posted on social media about being awakened by the temblor. ""I just went surfing in bed,"" tweeted Shelley Leveridge. Someone in a shop in Edmond posted: ""That was definitely the biggest one felt here at the store. #earthquake shook every bottle on the shelf."" It's highly unlikely there was damage from the quake, said Austin Holland, a research seismologist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey. Damage and injury are far more likely with quakes that register 4.0 and higher, the USGS reports. But the temblor stands out from others that have happened in the state because many people appear to have felt it, Holland said. The USGS received more than 500 responses to the ""Did you feel it?"" section on its site, and the state survey received at least 200 reports from Oklahomans, he said. In the past few years, earthquakes have become common in the state. In June, Oklahoma surpassed California in the number of temblors. An increase began in 2009, when 20 quakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher occurred, followed by 43 the next year and increasing every year except for 2012. Just last Sunday, nine earthquakes were recorded, including two that were 3.8 magnitude. ""When they first started happening they were a big deal,"" said Althea Peterson, a reporter with Tulsa World who has written about so many earthquakes, it's practically become a beat for her. ""People are starting to see foundational damage, cracking around door frames,"" she told CNN on Tuesday. In Tulsa, the quakes are felt, but barely, like a low rumble.

"(CNN) -- Utah officials for the time being do not have to formally recognize hundreds of same-sex marriages performed last December and earlier this year, after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday granted the state's request for a delay. Gov. Gary Herbert and Attorney General Sean Reyes had told the justices the issue of whether the state's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage is constitutional remains pending in the lower courts. Having to recognize those same sex marriages before the larger legal questions are fully decided, said the state, would be too disruptive. Once the constitutional issues are fully resolved --- likely by the Supreme Court in the next year or so -- both sides in the debate ""will know the status of the interim marriages. Until then, requiring [the state] to recognize plaintiffs' marriages and provide marital benefits is premature and unwarranted,"" said the appeal. In a one-paragraph order, the high court agreed. But that temporary action does not signal what the justices will ultimately think about the larger constitutional issues raised by gay and lesbian couples seeking a right to wed. A federal appeals court late last month affirmed Utah's voter-approved Amendment 3 violated the equal protection rights of same-sex couples. The law currently defines marriage only between one man and one woman. A group of plaintiffs then asked that court to order the state to recognize those marriage licenses already issued in late December and January. The judges did so, prompting the state's current stay request to the Supreme Court . About 1,300 same-sex couples obtained marriage licenses in the 17 days after a federal judge ruled on December 20 that Utah's ban was unconstitutional. Those marriages were stopped after a separate, temporary stay was put in place in January by the Supreme Court. That was the issue in the current litigation. The case is Herbert v. Evans (14A65). Same-sex marriages also were the subject of a ruling in Colorado on Friday. County clerks in the Denver area have been ordered by the state's highest court to cease issuing same-sex marriage licenses, until the issue is fully decided. The state attorney general had asked for the injunction, saying he plans to defend Colorado's voter-approved measure defining marriages as only between one man and one woman. John Suthers had argued allowing those marriages to go through while the issue is still being debated in the courts would be ""legal chaos."" After local judges in Colorado in recent weeks week also ruled the state's ban to be unconstitutional, several local clerks -- in Denver, Adams, Pueblo, and Boulder -- said they had to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples who requested them. But the state high court's action puts all that on hold for the time being. The same federal appeals court that acted in the Utah case on Friday also tossed out Oklahoma's ban. Both states plan to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to have the final say. Same-sex marriage: Fast Facts .","U.S. Supreme Court says marriage recognition not currently required .

"(CNN) -- As crew members of the last space shuttle flight hovered over Earth for the final time, they spoke with CNN Wednesday about the next frontier in space flight. ""I think that what we're going to see in the next few years is a very broadening horizon,"" shuttle commander Chris Ferguson told CNN's Ali Velshi hundreds of miles above Earth. ""What we'll do is we'll turn over the reins of that business to commercial partners."" Atlantis is scheduled to land at 5:56 a.m. ET Thursday, capping a 30-year shuttle program that has sent 355 astronauts into space. But Atlantis mission specialist Rex Walheim said he hopes the end of NASA's shuttle program marks the beginning of more flight opportunities. ""I think it's going to open up a new era of space flight,"" Walheim said. ""We want to take that next step -- get access to Earth orbit cheaper and more frequent. We can do that by partnering with our commercial partners, and that will allow NASA to really focus on the exploration,"" such as going beyond the Earth's orbit or to asteroids and Mars. ""I think it's going to be an extremely enjoyable and extremely exciting time for NASA,"" Walheim said. ""It's just that we have to get through this transition."" Atlantis lifted off July 8 on NASA's final space shuttle mission. The first shuttle, Columbia, blasted off in April 1981. Since then, space shuttle crews have fixed satellites, performed scientific studies, and ferried materials and people to International Space Station Alpha, a football field-sized construction project in orbit. NASA has sent five space shuttles on a total of 135 missions. When Atlantis lands, it will leave the United States with no way to lift humans into space for the first time in decades. NASA will rely on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit.","Astronauts say commercial partners will be in the future of space flight .

"(CNN) -- These young rappers today -- they use slang that no one in politics quite understands. Politics today -- jumping on every opportunity to slam an opponent. So in Maine on Thursday, when a video profile of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Michael Michaud was released by a blogger, neither the blogger nor the Democrat's campaign say they realized a song featured in the video included sexually graphic lyrics about a top Republican in the state. Oops. Here's what happened: . Blogger Alex Steed, who is co-founder of the production company Knack Factory, produced a day-in-the life video of Michaud, who is locked in a three-way race for governor. Under images of Michaud doing his work for the day are lyrics from the song ""King of Maine"" by Maine-based rapper Spose -- yes, Maine has rappers -- that includes a sexually explicit lyric about Republican Sen. Susan Collins. (Collins is not a candidate in the gubernatorial race.) The Maine Republican Party saw the video and understood the meaning of the lyric, ""I've got Susan Collins givin' everybody brain."" Brain is apparently a term for specific sexual acts. The Maine GOP called on the Michaud campaign to ""denounce, cease promoting, and take down"" the video. All of which the Michaud campaign did immediately once it learned the meaning of the lyric, spokesperson Lizzy Reinholt said. The Republican Party saved the video, however, and shared it with interested media. ""The Michaud campaign did not produce this video or have any control or advance knowledge of its contents. We do not condone the offensive song lyrics included in it,"" Reinholt said. Steed corroborated the account. He said the video was ""absolutely independently done. We received no payments from the campaign."" He also said he thought the term was meant to be ""an endorsement"" of Collins, who he described as a highly regarded Republican in the state. He saidhe learned of the meaning of the word when he woke up Friday morning with a press release from the Republican Party in his in-box. Collins, meanwhile will not weigh in. She has ""no comment,"" spokesman Kevin Kelley said. Spose, however, has relished the attention, tweeting, ""Shoutout to @mainegop for all the free press!!! ; )"" As for the future of the video, Steed says he's going to take out that lyric and republish the video. As for a political liability for Michaud? Probably not. But it's a headache for the campaign. By the way, Michaud, who is currently a congressman, did not vote for arming Syrian rebels to fight ISIS. He said the United States ""cannot afford to engage in another open-ended military conflict.""","Maine Republican Party jumps on video about Democratic candidate Michael Michaud .

"(CNN) -- It's like a chair that isn't there, but magically appears whenever you need it. It's called the Chairless Chair and you wear it on your legs like an exoskeleton: when it's not activated, you can walk normally or even run. And then, at the touch of a button, it locks into place and you can sit down on it. Like a chair that is now there. ""The idea came from wanting to sit anywhere and everywhere, and from working in a UK packaging factory when I was 17,"" says Keith Gunura, the 29-year old CEO and co-founder of noonee, the Zurich-based startup behind the device, ""standing for hours on end causes a lot of distress to lower limbs, but most workers get very few breaks and chairs are rarely provided, because they take up too much space. So I thought that the best idea was to strap an unobtrusive chair directly to myself."" The device never touches the ground, which makes it easier to wear: a belt secures it to the hips and it has straps that wrap around the thighs. A variable damper engages and supports the bodyweight, which is directed towards the heels of the shoes. These are specially designed and part of the mechanism, but an alternate version works with any footwear and touches the ground only when in a stationary position. The user just moves into the desired pose and then powers the device, which currently runs for about 24 hours on a single 6V battery. ""In addition to resting your leg muscles, it also provides optimal posture,"" adds noonee CTO and co-founder Bryan Anastisiades ""it keeps your back straight and can reduce the occurrence of bad postures for both healthy workers and those recovering from muscle related injuries."" Sammy Margo, a chartered physiotherapist, told CNN: ""As physiotherapists we actively encourage people to move throughout the day. This device looks like a great compromise in that it allows the wearer to move as well as sit intermittently. I wouldn't encourage its use for long term sitting, however it is suitable for people who need to vary their tasks."" The Chairless Chair is attracting interest and production line trials are set to start in Germany with BMW in September and with Audi later this year. While sitting down all day is so detrimental to health that it will shorten life expectancy, standing up in order to work is also a source of problems. Physical strain, repetitive movements and poor posture can lead to conditions called Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), which are now one of the leading causes of lost workday injury and illness. In 2011, MSDs accounted for 33 percent of all worker injuries and illnesses in the U.S. with over 378,000 cases, according to data from the United States Department of Labor. In Europe, over 40 million workers are affected by MSDs attributable to their job, according to a study entitled Fit For Work Europe and conducted across 23 European countries. The Chairless Chair represents an innovative approach to this problem, which is currently addressed mostly through ergonomics of the workplace. Although unique, it shares some similarities with the Swiss Milking Stool, a monopod used by farmers to milk cows, which dates back to the early 19th Century. It had straps that secured it to the wearer and required some practice to be used due to the single source of support. It was phased out by the rise of the milking parlor. An aluminium and carbon fibre frame keeps the overall weight of the Chairless Chair at just two kilograms, so it doesn't burden the wearer with too much excess weight and only marginally impairs movement. And in the future, it could be fitted with smart motors able to infer the user's intentions and offer the ideal posture without even the need to press a button. This could open up additional daily life applications, says Gunura: ""Imagine if you had one of these while you were riding on a crowded train: it would make for a much more comfortable commute. But we're also thinking about people behind the counter in retail, farmers picking fruit and even surgeons in the operating room. A chair would be impractical, but the Chairless Chair would fit in nicely."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: . British inventor claims world's first flying bicycle .

"Northern Gaza (CNN) -- Mohamed Al-Batsh recalls a premonition he had the first day Israeli airstrikes began in Gaza. He saw his father's face. ""He looked strange,"" Al-Batsh said. ""I went to my room, closed the door, and I knew he would die. I put my head on the pillow and cried for my father and the people who would die."" His father was a leader in Hamas' military wing. He was killed late Saturday in an Israeli airstrike, along with 17 others, in one of the bloodiest single strikes so far. One of the victims was just 10 years old. The attack in Shaja'ia, near Gaza City, highlights how residents of Gaza are trapped in war -- with no way out. By Monday, the death toll from nearly a week of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza had reached 186 -- all of them Palestinians -- with at least 1,390 wounded, according to Palestinian health authorities. Airstrikes have killed some militants; however, around 70% of the fatalities are civilians, according to the United Nations. Of the dead, more than 30 are children, the U.N. reported. Israel has said it will continue the offensive as long as the militant group Hamas keeps firing rockets into its territory. And Hamas shows no sign of letting up after launching almost 1,000 rockets at Israel. The scene of destruction is repeated in Jabalya, in northern Gaza. There, contents of a home are strewn in the road after another Israeli airstrike. No one was hurt. The house next door may have been the target, but half of the one beside it was destroyed. The Israeli military says its forces have struck 1,470 ""terror targets"" across Gaza, and that Hamas often hides missiles and other weapons in hospitals and private homes. ""My son isn't here,"" says Mohamed Abu Hassan, a neighbor. He says he who doesn't understand why he and his family are being punished. ""Is she fighting Israel?"" he asks about his wife. ""This is tyranny.""","The death toll from nearly a week of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza had reached 186 .

"(CNN) -- When was the last time you consulted an official government travel advisory before booking a trip? Wars (Syria), political protests (Brazil, Egypt, Turkey), floods (Germany, Manila) and disease outbreaks (China) are all enough to make us click headlines. But many travelers admit to not giving much credence to advisories from governments. In recent weeks, travel advisories for Egypt have hit high levels, with some governments evacuating their citizens. But a similar situation in December last year didn't stop Marielle Butters from traveling alone to Egypt. ""Three days after the president declared himself dictator and all was supposedly in chaos,"" recalls Butters about the timing of her trip. ""It was fine. I felt safe."" In July, protests in Brazil elicited travel alerts. But local journalist Felipe Araujo says the warnings were unnecessary. More: 10 things to know before visiting Colombia . ""The Brazilian government was siding with the protesters, publicly making an attempt to accommodate some of their wishes,"" says Araujo. ""Brazil was no less safe because of the protests."" Many travelers deliberately seek out reportedly dangerous locales, such as Kashmir, Afghanistan and Colombia, with few mishaps. What is a Travel Warning? Just how realistic are government travel alerts and warnings? And are they even worth looking at? Alerts and warnings are issued to provide an official source of trustworthy information. If an area were to be engaged in violent protests or war and a warning were not issued, that government would be subjected to serious criticism. The U.S. Department of State currently has 35 countries listed under a travel warning -- defined as a ""protracted condition that makes a country dangerous or unstable,"" such as war. A travel alert applies to temporary situations such as demonstrations. Three-quarters of Brits admitted they do not check official travel advice before traveling in a recent poll, and those that do said they often ignore it anyway. Countries currently listed by the U.S. Department of State with travel warnings include Egypt, Haiti, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, North Korea, the Philippines and Tunisia. A warning status means travelers should ""avoid or consider the risk of travel to that country. A Travel Warning is also issued when the U.S. government's ability to assist American citizens is constrained due to the closure of an embassy or consulate or because of a drawdown of its staff."" ""Our obligation is to provide information to the American citizens who are traveling and residing abroad to allow them to make informed decisions,"" says Michelle Bernier, managing director of overseas citizen services for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs. ""We want Americans to be vigilant and take security measures especially in an atmosphere of heightened concern."" The State Department website provides specific information on every country in the world. More: Women: Travel safely but keep traveling . Australia's entry includes a warning to ""be careful when consuming alcohol with unfamiliar people, as drink spiking can occur."" The UK's entry includes nearly 2,000 words on terrorist threats and crime, including details on pickpockets and ATM fraud. Do blanket warnings help or hinder? Not everyone finds official government warnings helpful. Like bad Yelp or TripAdvisor reviews, government travel warnings have the potential to negatively affect tourism revenue in a given country or area. ""The worst part is the blanket advisories,"" says traveler and photographer Jorge de Casanova. ""Just because one area of a country is having problems does not mean the whole country is unsafe."" Travel book author Lisa Egle travels primarily to developing countries. ""I check several travel advisories before any trip, not just the State Department, but the British and Australian equivalents for another perspective,"" says Egle. ""I take what they all say with a grain of salt. They tend to blow things out of proportion."" Before a trip to Indonesia last year, Egle recalls reading warnings about ""terrorist cells."" ""While these unfortunate incidents have occurred, they're not part of a widespread problem,"" she says. ""The country has 17,500 islands, so the number of these occurrences is disproportionate to the size of the country."" Sometimes there really is a wolf . Yet there are genuine risks associated with areas covered by alerts or warnings and ignoring them can occasionally result in problems. American student Andrew Pochter was killed in Alexandria during protests. Pochter was in Egypt teaching English for the summer. More: Should solo female travelers avoid India? The United States has had a travel warning in place for Mexico since April 2011. It states that ""crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country and can occur anywhere. U.S. citizens have fallen victim to TCO (Transnational Criminal Organizations) activity, including homicide, kidnapping, carjacking and highway robbery."" The warnings haven't stopped Americans from pouring into Mexico. In 2011, 20.1 million Americans visited Mexico. Less severe results of ignoring travel warnings . Ignoring travel advisories can affect a traveler's insurance. Some policies will not apply in places under a travel alert or warning. Depending on the circumstances, airlines may waive cancellation or rebooking fees in areas where official warnings are in place. US Airways acknowledges it doesn't distinguish between travel alerts and warnings and usually doesn't offer refunds on tickets when government travel advisories are issued. However it ""may"" waive the fees associated with rebooking. The U.S. government encourages travelers to visit its official travel website, register trip and contact information with the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (S.T.E.P.) and download an iPhone app. ""One thing I always try to do is register with S.T.E.P., so the government can track my whereabouts,"" says travel writer Lola Akinmade Ackerstrom. ""Having a laissez-faire attitude about travel advisories really isn't appropriate. The government has a lot more intelligence (than the general public), so take them seriously."" Rejecting warnings . Some governments refute travel warnings, especially when they're subject to warnings from other governments. Travel warnings advising against travel to Peru in February 2013 were strongly opposed by the local government, with ministers calling for U.S. warnings about kidnappings in the Cuzco region to be retracted. In 2010, the Jamaican government criticized a travel warning against the entire country, when riots erupted in a small Kingston area. Guidebook author Lebawit Girma was in Jamaica at the time. ""I was amazed at the travel advisories against the whole island,"" she says. ""For anyone who doesn't know Jamaica, it would be easy to cancel plans. ""Jamaica is a big island, so it didn't stop me from heading to my usual spots in Negril and Montego Bay."" More: 8 things travelers in Bangkok should look out for . Ashley Charmers and her husband canceled their travel plans for Turkey in June 2013 due to protests there. ""We had been debating canceling our 10-day trip through Turkey after receiving emails from our families and S.T.E.P. ""Days before our departure we decided to cancel because of concerns regarding serious travel delays and suspensions. Our decision cost us $500."" Even seasoned travelers, who are comfortable in the unfamiliar, can be taken off guard. In March 2013, travel blogger Oneika Raymond's wallet was taken from her backpack in Aswad, Egypt. She winces at the memory because she ""wasn't paying attention"" after making a few purchases. ""Did I feel safe in Egypt? No, not particularly,"" she says. ""After that I found myself very suspicious of everyone."" More: Chinese tourists targeted in Paris pickpocketing spate . Have you traveled to places under travel alerts or warnings?

"(CNN) -- Monday began on an optimistic note for many of the journalists who had campaigned for the release of three imprisoned Al Jazeera English journalists in Egypt. They expected that the journalists -- Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed -- would be freed after nearly six months behind bars. ""Make this freedom day,"" Al Jazeera correspondent Sue Turton wrote on Twitter. Alex Thomson, an anchor for Britain's Channel 4 News who'd carried masking tape with him for months and posted dozens of Twitter photos of his mouth duct-taped in a dramatic show of solidarity with the Al Jazeera journalists, had taken a picture of a full roll of tape and written hopefully Sunday, ""Goodbye to all this? Verdict is tomorrow."" But after the verdict was read, and the three journalists were sentenced to seven-plus years in prison, Thomson adorned the duct tape once again and posted a new photo. He captioned it, ""Depressing day for freedom of speech."" Thomson's point of view was shared by reporters, producers and editors the world over. Staffers at the BBC planned a minute of silence Tuesday morning to demonstrate support for their counterparts at Al Jazeera. CNN called the sentencing ""unjust"" and said in a statement, ""We stand alongside the journalistic community in calling for the immediate release of these journalists."" Officials in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and other countries criticized the sentencing, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged Egypt's President to consider ""all available remedies, including pardons."" However, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said Tuesday that he would not intervene in the case, Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram news website reported. ""I will not interfere in the verdicts of the justice system because the Egyptian judiciary is independent and proud,"" the President said, speaking at a graduation ceremony at the Military Academy in Cairo. He added that ""no one should comment or speak about the state's institutions, and we should adhere to the verdicts of the justice system even when others don't understand it."" The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also defended itself Monday amid the international condemnation, saying it ""strongly rejects any comment from a foreign party that casts doubt on the independence of the Egyptian judiciary and the justice of its verdicts."" An editorial in Tuesday's New York Times called the convictions ""the latest effort by the country's military-backed rulers to crush all dissent."" The Times noted that ""the defendants are allowed to appeal the verdicts, but the process could take years."" On Tuesday morning, one of Greste's brothers, Andrew, said he would be visiting him in prison. Peter Greste had previously worn white clothes during the trial, but now, in accordance with Egyptian standards for convicted prisoners, ""he'll be dressed in blue,"" Andrew wrote on Twitter. ""It's going to be tough."" Turton, who was at Al Jazeera's headquarters in Doha, Qatar, on Monday and sentenced in absentia to 10 years in an Egyptian prison, said in a televised interview that Monday's verdicts were ""heartbreaking."" ""We really thought we could trust the Egyptian judicial system to be fair,"" she said. Other Al Jazeera journalists spoke out with ferocity on Twitter and other social networking sites. Correspondent Anita McNaught reacted to the verdict by tweeting, ""Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Mad. Wrong. Peter, Baher and Mohamed did nothing to deserve this #Egypt."" Correspondent Alan Fisher wrote, ""Every journalist in the world should be concerned about the message this sends."" James Bays, the network's diplomatic correspondent, urged his colleagues to remember the ""sense of anger and injustice today, and campaign every day until we get them out."" That's what Al Anstey, the managing director of Al Jazeera English, promised to do. He said in a statement Monday that the Egyptian court's ruling ""defies logic, sense, and any semblance of justice."" Using the hashtag adopted by the network and its supporters, he wrote on Twitter, ""Thank you for your support to #freeajstaff. Keep it going. We will continue with resolve till Peter, Baher and Mohamed are free."" Lindsey Hilsum, the international editor for Channel 4 News, who was in Baghdad on Monday, posted a picture of herself there with her face gagged, like Thomson with his duct tape. ""Some say we campaign more about unjust imprisonment of journalists than others,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""But if we are silenced, how will you know about the rest?""

"London, England (CNN) -- British troops will get new camouflage uniforms for the first time in more than 40 years, based on computer modeling of Afghanistan's terrain, the Ministry of Defence announced Sunday. The ""multi-terrain pattern,"" as the military has dubbed the new design, is the first new pattern from the Ministry of Defence since 1968, it said. It is specifically designed with Afghanistan's Helmand province in mind, the ministry said in a statement. The British military have suffered heavy losses in the southern province this year. More than 100 British troops have died in Afghanistan in 2009, making it the deadliest for UK troops in many years. The new design was put together in six months, funded as an ""urgent operational requirement"" project worth £250,000 ($400,000). ""This new camouflage will help our troops blend into different environments in Helmand Province to stay hidden from the Taliban,"" Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth said in a statement. The project included aerial and scientific photography in Afghanistan ""to provide the right colors and their brightness,"" the ministry said. ""The colors were fed into a computer and computer modeling was used to represent the Green Zone, deserts and mixed environments in Afghanistan."" Uniforms in the new pattern will be issued to 4 Mechanised Brigade troops deploying to Afghanistan in March, the ministry said. It will then be introduced across all three services starting in 2011.","British troops will get new camouflage uniforms for the first time in more than 40 years .

"(CNN) -- A new era in space exploration dawned Tuesday as a slender rocket shot into the dark Florida sky before sunrise, carrying the first private spacecraft bound for the International Space Station. ""We're now back on the brink of a new future, a future that embraces the innovation the private sector brings to the table,"" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said. ""The significance of this day cannot be overstated."" The unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 3:44 a.m., carrying 1,300 pounds of food, clothing and scientific experiments on a demonstration mission to gauge the company's ability to safely and efficiently deliver supplies to astronauts staffing the orbiting station. Opinion: Private space travel -- A new era begins? If successful, the test could open the door to a wave of commercial exploitation of space. Tuesday's launch marks the culmination of six years of preparation to bring commercial flights to the space station following the retirement of NASA's space shuttle fleet last year. It's backed by entrepreneur Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal. Stellar week for SpaceX founder Elon Musk . ""Every bit of adrenaline in my body released at that moment,"" Musk said of the launch, in a statement released by NASA. ""People were really giving it their all. For us, it was like winning the Super Bowl."" The rocket launched without a hitch following a flawless countdown that came three days after a faulty valve on one of the rocket's engines forced a last-second postponement. Its solar array panels deployed later Tuesday. At 180 feet tall and 12 feet in diameter, the Falcon 9 rocket is tiny in comparison to the football-field-long Saturn V rockets that carried Apollo spacecraft into orbit. It carries the company's Dragon cargo capsule capable of carrying 13,228 pounds of supplies into orbit, the company said. The capsule is scheduled to perform a series of maneuvers that should bring it within reach of the space station's robotic arm on Friday. If NASA gives the go-ahead, the crew will use the arm to attach the capsule to the station and begin unloading supplies, according to SpaceX. It will remain attached to the station for two weeks before it plummets back into the atmosphere and splashes into the Pacific Ocean off the California coast, according to SpaceX. Read more about the launch on CNN's Light Years blog . The cargo manifest for the trip includes 674 pounds of food, clothing and miscellaneous supplies, 46 pounds of supplies for use in science experiments, 271 pounds of cargo bags for use in future flights and 22 pounds of computer equipment. It will return with science experiments, hardware and used gear. Cremated human remains were placed in the second stage of the Falcon and will orbit the Earth. Celestis Inc. charges families $2,995 to launch 1 gram of remains in this type of memorial spaceflight. NASA's Internet tool SkyWatch is providing information on viewing the Dragon from Earth. The cargo capsule will continue its orbit Wednesday as it travels toward the space station. The launch is an important step for NASA and the United States, which currently has no means of independently reaching space. NASA relies on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit. ""What's really important is not control, as much as it is the fact that the United States will once again be in the lead, will be providing our own vehicles to take our own astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station,"" Bolden said. ""It's fine to rely on partners, but that's not where the greatest nation in the world wants to be."" White House science adviser John P. Holdren also hailed the launch. ""Every launch into space is a thrilling event, but this one is especially exciting because it represents the potential of a new era in American spaceflight,"" he said. ""Partnering with U.S. companies such as SpaceX to provide cargo and eventually crew service to the International Space Station is a cornerstone of the president's plan for maintaining America's leadership in space."" SpaceX is conducting the flight as part of a contract that could be worth as much as $396 million, according to company spokeswoman Kirstin Brost Grantham. The company has completed 37 of the 40 milestones in the contract and has received $381 million so far, she said. Musk likened the significance of the launch to the growth of the commercial Internet -- from its underpinnings as a government initiative to the technological, economic and cultural engine it is today. ""I think we're at a similar inflection point for space,"" he said. ""I hope and I believe that this mission will be historic in marking that turning point towards a rapid advancement in space transportation technology."" The first attempt to launch the rocket was halted Saturday when a flight computer detected high pressure in an engine combustion chamber. Workers replaced the valve on Saturday, SpaceX said. The company plans 11 more flights to the space station. One of a handful of private companies receiving funds from NASA to develop a space taxi system, SpaceX hopes the experience with the cargo flights will help the company reach its goal of carrying astronauts aboard the Dragon. The company is developing a heavy-lift rocket with twice the cargo capability of the space shuttle, and also dreams of building a spacecraft that could carry a crew to Mars.

"San Diego, Calif. (CNN) -- Twenty years ago, an editor at the Los Angeles Times told me the newspaper had changed the way it reported on Mexico. ""Now we cover it as a local story,"" he said. Why not? There are more Mexicans living in Los Angeles than in any other city in the world except for Mexico City. From one end of the Golden State to another, Hispanics are a natural part of the cultural landscape. Mexican restaurants that are anything but exceptional don't stay open long because the competition is too stiff. Cities, counties, streets and subdivisions are named after Catholic saints. You hear Spanish in the air, and no longer question why that is. Most weekends, in many cities, there is a Mexican-style festival with food and music. Mariachis and margaritas are always on the menu. Supermarket clerks, bank tellers and restaurant cashiers greet me by rolling the ""r's"" in my last name: Navarrrrrette. Welcome to California, which will soon achieve a milestone of sorts. If state demographers are correct, in the nation's most populous state, which is home to more than 1 in 10 Americans, Hispanics will soon overtake whites to become the state's largest racial/ethnic group. Demographers predict that sometime this spring in California, Hispanics will make up 39% of the population while non-Hispanic whites will account for 38.8%. It's a nativist nightmare. For those Californians who worry about the phenomenon that sociologists call ""cultural displacement,"" those feelings of being marginalized and left behind will only intensify. So will the sense of irony. A state that was once controlled by Mexico, before Manifest Destiny came along and ordained that God wanted white folks from Kansas and Missouri to have it, is now heavily populated by the runaway children of Mexico and their offspring. An enormous swath of oceanfront property has been reclaimed without a formal declaration of war. Forget what you've heard about a reconquista: the fabled reconquering of the Southwest by Mexican-Americans on behalf of Mexico. That's loco. Most Mexican-Americans are barely on speaking terms with Mexico. We (I am among them) understand that our neighbor had no room in its economy for our dark-skinned, uneducated parents and grandparents, who were forced to go north. Now, most of us reciprocate and have little room in our hearts for Mexico. Our loyalty is to the United States. Even if we were speaking to our Mexican brethren, we'd be conversing in different languages. Most Mexicans speak Spanish, and about 80% of U.S. Latinos speak English. Americans need to study up on this group. The Census Bureau estimates that Hispanics, whose heritage can be traced to more than a dozen countries and who make up 17% of the U.S. population, will account for as much as 29% by 2050. And while some Americans might like to believe that these figures are artificially high due to undocumented immigrants, these are U.S. citizens and legal residents we're talking about. These are just, as comedian George Lopez likes to say, the people who answer the door when the bell rings. About 70% of this population will be Mexican or Mexican-American. And when we arrive at the point where nearly 3 in 10 Americans are Hispanic, Hispanics will see our imprint just about everywhere -- food, language, sports, fashion, entertainment, business, pop culture and beyond. So what does it mean that California has gone back to its roots and become what it was before 1850: a Hispanic state? On the one hand, there is always the chance that, in a state such as California, this could be a kind of psychological tipping point where even the densest folks in commerce, media, academia and other fields finally get the message that Hispanics are an essential and productive part of the state's economic engine. In the Golden State, whatever business you're in, and whatever goal you're pursuing, if you're not incorporating Hispanics into your vision and onto your team, then you're leaving money on the table for your competition. On the other hand, those folks who worry about change might become even more fearful and hostile--for it is fear that drives the immigration debate. Americans didn't just wake up one morning and discover the concept of ""rule of law"" and that the United States shared a border with Mexico. Those things have been around for quite a while. What's new is the demographics. As soon as many non-Hispanics began to see this writing on the wall, they started building more walls. So, if enough Americans deny and resist the new reality and try to -- as they say south of the border, cover the sun with their thumb -- things might get worse before they get better. There could be more conflict and hostility, as Hispanics become frustrated with efforts to thwart their ascendancy. Of course, Hispanics themselves have the greatest power to determine their destiny. We have to make better choices and stop being a cheap date for the political parties. We have to put the United States, and our community, before our allegiance to any political party. Most Hispanics are registered Democrats, but this goes for Hispanic Republicans, too. We have to elect better leaders and hold them accountable. We have to be as hard on our friends as we are on our enemies. We have to reflect now and then on what road we're on, and change course if necessary. And we have to stop squabbling with one another, and make our community safe for diverse opinions that stray from the established narrative. There is reason for optimism. There are better days ahead, and nothing to fear. Hispanics didn't just come to America. In California, and the rest of the Southwest, it was the other way around. America came to Hispanics. Now we are one and the same.","Ruben Navarrette: Hispanics part of California cultural landscape .

"(CNN) -- When Charity Agbameva went into labor last year there were complications. Realizing she needed medical attention, she traveled from Nigeria, where she was living, to a hospital in Keta, in the Volta Region of her native Ghana. Despite being one of just two hospitals serving the entire municipality, the hospital had only two doctors, each serving 29,000 people, and one nurse for every 1,500 patients. It had no special facilities for women and children. When Charity reached the hospital, medics realized she needed a blood transfusion, but the hospital had no blood bank, and no ventilator to give her oxygen. Charity died in hospital. Last month, her story was broadcast on GTV and TV3, Ghana's leading TV station, to an estimated 8 - 10 million people across the country. It provoked strong reactions in Keta and prompted a major debate on four radio stations lasting several days --- bringing attention to Ghana's staggering incidence of maternal deaths . Ghana has a reputation as a beacon of democracy in Africa. That reputation has been boosted by a rapidly growing economy, and the discovery of oil on our western coastline. So strong are the economic indicators that analysts at the World Bank have conferred upon us that most cherished of things -- Middle Income status. Read more: What Ghana can teach the rest of Africa about democracy . But within government and civil society we know that positive headlines don't tell the full story. One of the biggest challenges -- a real litmus test for Ghana -- is whether we can significantly reduce maternal deaths across the country. In Ghana, 4,000 women die every year and over 200,000 are disabled due to pregnancy related complications. These figures are among the highest in the world. If pregnancy is not a disease or death sentence, why are so many women dying or maimed in the process of giving birth? So how can a country that basks in so much international acclaim be failing its expectant mothers and their children so badly, and what can we do to improve the situation? For a start we have to better understand the social and cultural dimensions of maternal healthcare in Ghana and similarly under-developed countries. And we must respond to them. To make a real difference our awareness campaigns must be aimed at changing the mindsets of our people, especially those living in the rural areas. While doing my research I noticed that previous campaigns were predominantly urban centered and driven by ""professional"" imperatives. They failed to include the voices of women and the poor, marginalized communities -- those that actually bear the brunt of the maternal tragedy. As a result key concerns have not been addressed. For example, most pregnant women in rural communities rely on traditional birth attendants to deliver their babies. However, following a WHO directive, the Ghana Health Service discouraged this, urging pregnant mothers to give birth in the hospitals instead. But instead of getting skilled care these women have experienced overcrowded hospitals, poor facilities and an acute shortage of qualified staff. Read more: Too many mothers still dying . There is also the issue of infrastructure. Bad roads and poor transport links, exacerbated by the lack of ambulances also mean that pregnant women in emergencies cannot get to the hospital on time. Many are carried by motor bikes and local taxis over considerable distances and die en route. In 2009, I directed ""The Lights Have Gone out Again,"" a documentary that contributed powerful new testimonies to Ghana's maternal health debate. I was so moved by what I saw in the remote, isolated villages that I was determined to ""humanize"" the maternal death statistics and highlight concerns that are so often excluded from the regular health debate. The documentary was televised and screened across the country, receiving critical applause. It enabled us to start a fresh dialogue on maternal health and triggered our determination to find an inclusive way of mobilizing Ghanaians around the need to reduce maternal deaths and improve maternal healthcare, more generally. We decided to use television for this new campaign because of its widespread popularity as a news and entertainment medium in both urban and rural areas of Ghana. Many families and whole households usually gather round the box for most of the evening. We decided to complement television with a radio series in Ghanaian languages to further extend the educational reach of the project and to maximize its impact. Read more: The American secretary who became a Ghanaian king . With funding from the Embassy of the Netherlands, a long standing supporter of the Ghana health sector and advice from the Ghana Health Service, UNICEF, Marie Stopes International, Ghana Coalition of NGO's in Health and others, the Maternal Health Channel Television and Radio Series was born at an impressive launch in Accra in February 2013. The first two shows, telling the story of Charity Agbameva, provoked a huge response from viewers. Significantly, we also heard contributions from health leaders at the hospital where she died. When the phone lines were opened, callers broadly agreed that a new partnership was needed between government, the hospitals, and the community, and that it was important to complement behavioral change with new policies. Critically, the hospitals urgently need more skilled personnel and improved facilities. The media response has generally also been impressive with great coverage in the newspapers, on radio and television. These are exciting times for the Maternal Health Channel but it's still early days as more people join the renewed debate about lifting Ghana's maternal health burden. So, although we may miss the Millennium Development Goals to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by 75% by 2015, I firmly believe that by being more innovative in our campaigning we can start to turn the corner on this and so many other critical healthcare issues in the years ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Kwesi Owusu.","Every year in Ghana 4,000 women die and over 200,000 are disabled during pregnancy .

"LANSING, Michigan (CNN) -- Sherrill Freeborough has a disarming smile, an optimistic spirit and an uncertain future. GM's Grand River plant has gone from two shifts to one and the Delta Township plant has gone from three to one. She owns two Saturn dealerships in the Lansing area, but will lose her partnership with General Motors in three years because the automaker is discontinuing the Saturn and Pontiac brands as part of its restructuring plan. ""I am a small business owner,"" Freeborough told us during a visit to one of her showrooms. ""Everything I have I have put into the dealerships, my home -- everything is in the company. ... My husband still can't breathe. He still asks 'what are we doing? I thought you were just going to sell cars.' ""So, yeah, everything in my life,"" Freeborough said. ""I can't have a bad day and go home and tell him. I have to be happy when I go home because everything we have is wrapped up in this company."" Across town, Mike Huerta is another stakeholder in the debate over General Motors' future. The unionized autoworker will be out of a job in the next few weeks. The Delta Township assembly plant where Huerta works once had three shifts; it is now down to one. Across town at the Lansing Grand River assembly line, work is down from two shifts to one.

""We had some senators from down South in particular with a lot of Nissan and Honda and Toyota plants basically come up and say that we should go bankrupt. They are not talking about somebody that you can't see. That means me. That takes away my family's livelihood."" Huerta, who has a two-year-old, said he has sharply cut back expenses since receiving his layoff notice. He said he's not eating out or going to the movie theater. He's also packing lunches for work. He even decided not to exchange Christmas gifts with his wife this past year. Huerta is attending Lansing Community College in case GM doesn't call him back, ""to get a little leg up"" if he is forced into a horrible local job market. Freeborough said she is waiting for critical answers from GM and fellow Saturn dealers who are determined to find a new product line to sell once GM ends their relationship. Those cars could be from India or China, and Freeborough concedes that could pose a sales challenge in a town defined by its long American auto industry heritage.

"(CNN) -- On November 24, 1859, the first edition of a book that would shake the most deeply established beliefs about life was published in London. What would eventually be known as ""The Origin of Species"" was the opening shot in a debate that hasn't ended, even 150 years later. In a series of books starting in 1976 and in his 2002 TED Talk, biologist Richard Dawkins has explored the implications of Darwin's work. In ""The Selfish Gene,"" Dawkins wrote, ""Living organisms had existed on earth, without ever knowing why, for over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one of them. His name was Charles Darwin."" Watch the TED Talk by Richard Dawkins . Dawkins argues that there is no doubt that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is true and, unlike some other scholars of the subject, says belief in evolution is not compatible with faith in religion. In fact, he argues, science and religion undermine each other. ""I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith,"" Dawkins says in his TED Talk. There's no room for a God in the world as he sees it, and he believes atheists should be forceful in opposing religion. He acknowledges that it's an unpopular case to make, particularly in the United States. ""It's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub,"" he said. ""And that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird, way-out minority."" Watch an interview with Dawkins . According to Dawkins, life was not created by an intelligent designer. In ""The Selfish Gene,"" he wrote that science has established that, ""We are survival machines -- robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes."" Read why another writer believes evolution and faith can be compatible . Darwin himself was very slow to make his theory of evolution by natural selection public, taking 15 years from his early insights on the subject to the publication of the book -- and publishing it then only after naturalist Alfred Wallace had independently come up with the idea of evolution. Darwin struggled with the book, which he called ""my abominable volume"" and said that it ""has cost me so much labor that I almost hate it."" The book went through six editions with Darwin's input and sold many copies, but it was controversial from the start. Read the view of an advocate of ""intelligent design"" In an interview by e-mail last week, CNN asked Dawkins about Darwin and religion. CNN: How would you describe the book's importance compared to other classic books? Richard Dawkins: Dan Dennett described natural selection as the best idea anyone ever had, and that is an easily defensible talking-point. Wallace independently had the idea, and the main reason Darwin is remembered more than the admirable Wallace is that Darwin wrote the book that changed people's minds. Evolution by natural selection didn't trickle into public consciousness but was properly launched, fully fashioned, in a brilliant book. T.H. Huxley surely wasn't the only reader to close the book saying, ""How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that."" CNN: In your TED Talk, you described American biologists as being in a ""state of war"" when it comes to defending evolution against its critics. Do you think that's still the case, nearly eight years later? Dawkins: Yes. More so, if anything. CNN: You contrast the British 10 pound note, which displays a likeness of Darwin, to the ""In God We Trust"" on American currency. Why are attitudes in Britain so significantly different on this question? Dawkins: I think it stems from the far greater popularity of religion in America, but that only pushes the question back a stage. Why is America so much more religious than most other western countries? CNN: What's your sense of Darwin's influence around the world? Dawkins: Evolution is almost universally accepted among those who understand it, almost universally rejected by those who don't. CNN: You maintain that science is corrosive to religion and that religion undermines science. In what practical ways do you see the influence of religion today affecting what science can accomplish? Dawkins: Since we are talking about practical ways, the obvious example is stem cell research. But there is a more pernicious and pervasive influence, which is an active shutting down of the critical faculties. Religion teaches us to be satisfied with non-explanations, and this is viciously corrosive of science and of the life of the mind generally. CNN: In your 1986 book, ""the Blind Watchmaker,"" you wrote that, ""For reasons that are not entirely clear to me, Darwinism seems more in need of advocacy than similarly established truths in other branches of science."" Do you have any further thoughts on why that's the case? Dawkins: I think it is mostly because of biblical literalism. Then there's the added fact that, as the great molecular biologist Jacques Monod said, 'The trouble with natural selection is that everybody THINKS he understands it.' CNN: What's the greatest remaining mystery about evolution? Dawkins: How the evolution of the brain gave rise to the emergent property we call subjective consciousness. CNN: What question would you ask Darwin if he were alive today? Dawkins: Why did you wait so long before publishing your brilliant idea? CNN: You make the argument in the TED Talk for atheists to assert themselves boldly and overcome the cultural stigma against opposing religion. Do you see signs that such an attitude is taking hold? Dawkins: Yes, I am happy to say I do think so. I'd like to think that books such as those by Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens and me have initiated a turning of the tide.

"(CNN) -- We are only two games into a new English Premier League season, but with seven minutes to go in their match against Everton, some Arsenal fans may have been quietly writing off their team's title chances. They also may well have pondered what had changed from last season. In the corresponding fixture in April, Arsenal were thumped 3-0 by Roberto Martinez's side and as the clock ticked towards full time at Goodison Park on Saturday the same result looked on the cards. After being harried and hurried by Everton, the Gunners were trailing by two goals and staring down the barrel before the game was turned on its head with late strikes from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud. Everton had assumed control of the match with two first-half goals. Gareth Barry's cross was headed in at the far post by Seamus Coleman in the 19th minute and on the stroke of halftime Steven Naismith doubled the lead as the Toffees caught the visitors on the counterattack. Romelu Lukaku brushed off a challenge from Per Mertesacker to break down the right before laying on a pass for the advancing Naismith to slide home under goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Television replays showed that Naismith was marginally offside but while Arsene Wenger flapped his arms in protest the Goodison Park faithful celebrated. Everton's industrious midfield continued to thwart Arsenal's advances in the second half before the Gunners fired their late salvo. Ramsey toe-poked Santi Cazorla's low cross past Tim Howard in the 83rd minute to net his fourth goal in five matches before Olivier Giroud, who replaced new signing Alexis Sanchez at halftime, headed home to make it 2-2 in the final minute of normal time. In the four added minutes, Arsenal looked as though they might snatch all three points but it ended honors even. The draw maintains Arsenal's unbeaten start to the season and lifts them to third in the table with four points following a 2-1 win against Crystal Palace on the opening weekend. Everton have two points from two games and are 10th. Earlier in the day, Chelsea maintained their 100% start to the season with a 2-0 win against Premier League new boys, Leicester City. Second-half strikes from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard earned Jose Mourinho's side all three points to keep the West Londoners at the top of the table on goal difference. Swansea City and West Ham United were also winners on Saturday. After beating Loius van Gaal's Manchester United 2-1 at Old Trafford last weekend Garry Monk's side bagged another three points with a 1-0 win at home to Burnley. West Ham opened their account with a 3-1 win at Crystal Palace after losing to Tottenham Hotspur on the opening day of the season. The games between Aston Villa and Newcastle United and Southampton and West Bromwich Albion ended in goalless draws.

"Abbottabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden was not armed but did put up resistance when U.S. forces stormed a compound outside Islamabad and killed him, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. Carney, reading a narrative drawn up by the Defense Department, provided new details of the events that transpired early Monday when 25 U.S. Navy SEALs in two Black Hawk helicopters landed outside the compound in Abbottabad, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of Islamabad. ""They had to breach through walls,"" CIA Director Leon Panetta, who commanded the mission and was in contact with the 25 commandos as it unfolded, told PBS. Live blog: Bin Laden operation . There were no armed guards around the compound, said a U.S. official who asked not to be identified because the official was not authorized to speak on the record. In an operation that lasted nearly 40 minutes, the SEALs -- working in two groups -- methodically cleared the compound, where three families were living, Carney said. One group went to a separate building in the compound; the other to the three-story building housing a family on the first floor and bin Laden and his family on the second and third floors, Carney said. On the first floor of bin Laden's building, two al Qaeda couriers were killed, as was a woman who was caught in the crossfire, Carney said. Bin Laden killing caps decade-long manhunt . Continuing their ascent to the second and third floors, the commandos found bin Laden and his wife, both of whom were unarmed, in a room, Carney said. ""She rushed one of the U.S. assaulters and was shot in the leg but not killed,"" he said. ""Bin Laden was then shot and killed."" The U.S. official said bin Laden was shot when he made a threatening move. In all, said the U.S. official who sought anonymity, five of the approximately two dozen people in the compound were killed -- the two couriers, the woman, bin Laden and his son. Officials have not publicly identified everyone who was in the compound. Materials taken from the compound included 10 hard drives, five computers and more than 100 storage devices, such as disks, DVDs and thumb drives, a senior U.S. official told CNN Tuesday. Navy SEALs, ""the quiet professionals"" That material is being reviewed, said John Brennan, President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser. In his first public comments on the raid, Attorney General Eric Holder Tuesday declared the operation ""lawful, legitimate and appropriate in every way."" U.S. officials have said they might release a post-mortem photo taken of bin Laden. There are ""a lot to choose from,"" and most are ""very graphic,"" a senior government official said. What photos could show . The officials have said DNA matching shows bin Laden was killed. But the Taliban have questioned the assertion. ""Obama has not got any strong evidence that can prove his claim over killing of the Sheikh Osama bin Laden,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mojahed said. ""And secondly, the closest sources for Sheikh Osama bin Laden have not confirmed"" the death, he added. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, issued a statement Tuesday saying that members of bin Laden's family were ""in safe hands and being looked after in accordance with law. Some of them needing medical care are under treatment in the best possible facilities. As per policy, they will be handed over to their countries of origin."" The jubilation in many parts of the world over bin Laden's killing gave way Tuesday to increasing questions about how the world's most-wanted terrorist could have hidden in a populated area two miles from the prestigious Kakul military academy, the West Point of Pakistan. ""How did bin Laden stay at that compound for about six years or so and be undetected?"" Brennan asked. ""What type of support did he have outside of that compound in the Abbottabad area or more broadly within Pakistan? We're going to look carefully at this and get to the bottom of it all."" Raid sparks questions: Is Pakistan doing enough? The mission took place without Pakistani leadership being informed beforehand, U.S. officials said. ""It was decided that any effort to work with the Pakistanis could jeopardize the mission,"" Panetta told Time magazine. ""They might alert the targets."" However, Brennan insisted that ""Pakistan has been a strong partner in the effort to destroy al Qaeda."" In a Washington Post column, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari expressed satisfaction ""that the source of the greatest evil of the new millennium has been silenced, and his victims given justice"" and defended his country's actions. ""Some in the U.S. press have suggested that Pakistan lacked vitality in its pursuit of terrorism, or worse yet that we were disingenuous and actually protected the terrorists we claimed to be pursuing. Such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news, but it doesn't reflect fact,"" Zardari wrote. Time magazine: CIA chief on why Pakistan wasn't told . The foreign ministry called bin Laden's death ""an important milestone in the fight against terrorism,"" but also expressed ""deep concerns"" about the fact that U.S. officials failed to notify the government of Pakistan prior to the attack. ""This event of unauthorized unilateral action cannot be taken as a rule,"" the statement said. ""Such actions undermine cooperation and may also sometime constitute (a) threat to international peace and security."" The senior Pakistani intelligence official who spoke Tuesday to CNN said, ""Yes, we did fail to locate him. Yes, we are embarrassed. But that does not mean we are incompetent and straddling the fence."" U.S. anticipates al Qaeda threats . The compound where bin Laden was holed up was surrounded by walls 10 to 18 feet tall and topped by barbed wire. It sat far from a main road, secluded. How al Qaeda and its adherents will be affected remains an open question. ""Leadership in al Qaeda tends to be replaced,"" former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told CNN Tuesday. ""I expect there will be someone who will step up."" Rumsfeld, who was in office during the September 11 attacks, praised Bush administration policies that came under heated criticism. Noting that tracking one of bin Laden's trusted couriers led the United States to identify bin Laden's location, Rumsfeld defended the Bush administration's practice of detaining low-level people, a practice that critics derided as unwarranted. ""It is those individuals that know the habits and locations of the senior people,"" he said. No obvious successor to bin Laden . Rumsfeld also stood by the use of waterboarding, which the Obama administration has outlawed as torture. Rumsfeld said the information taken from three people who were waterboarded and passed on to then-CIA Director Michael Hayden proved to be ""enormously valuable."" However, White House spokesman Carney said Monday's events had not changed Obama's opposition to so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. Panetta said he too saw no need for a return to using such techniques. ""Obviously, there was some valuable information that was derived through those kinds of interrogations, but I guess the question that everybody will always debate is whether or not those approaches had to be used in order to get the same information,"" he told CBS News. ""And that, frankly, is an open question."" CNN's Nic Robertson, Ted Barrett, Nick Paton Walsh, Elise Labott, Mary Snow, Allan Chernoff, Jeanne Meserve, Pam Benson, Brian Todd, Barbara Starr, Suzanne Kelly, Jessica Yellin and John King contributed to this report.","Attorney general declares the operation ""lawful, legitimate and appropriate in every way""

"Washington (CNN) -- The air we breathe in the United States is getting better -- at least by one recent measure. New data released by NASA this week show that at least one pollutant, nitrogen dioxide, has decreased substantially over the past decade. Areas with a high level of nitrogen dioxide have decreased an average of about 40%, said Bryan Duncan, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""It happened everywhere, not just in a few areas. It's over the whole country. So this is a real success story for everyone in the U.S.,"" he said. The decrease is particularly prominent in the crowded Northeast, the Ohio River Valley, and some major cities. For example, NASA reported a 32% decrease in New York City and a 42% decrease in Atlanta between the periods of 2005-2007 and 2009-2011. Duncan attributes the decrease to two factors: cars that are more efficient, and scrubbers on smokestack emissions that remove toxins. ""It means fewer hospital admissions, it means fewer emergency room visits, it means fewer doctor visits,"" said Janice Nolen, assistant vice president of the American Lung Association. Man-made sources emit an estimated 19.4 million metric tons of nitrogen oxides a year in the United States, produced primarily by vehicles and by coal-fired power plants, according to the American Lung Association. Nitrogen dioxide is a yellow-brown gas that can cause respiratory problems like coughing, asthma, and trouble breathing. It is one of six common air pollutants for which the Environmental Protection Agency has set limits. Nolen, who produces an annual report called State of the Air, pointed out that these pollutants are a separate concern from greenhouse gases, which are blamed for climate change, and were not measured in this report. And, she said, over 140 million Americans still live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to the EPA. ""We have about half the nation who lives in counties that have unhealthy levels of air pollution,"" said Nolen. ""And what we're learning is, levels that we thought were safe were not, and we need to clean up even more, to provide real protection. We still have a long way to go."" The Supreme Court in April upheld an EPA rule intended to further reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide that blow across state lines. The decrease cited in the NASA study is particularly prominent in the crowded Northeast, the Ohio River Valley, and some major cities.

"(CNN) -- George Smith, one of the Navajo code talkers who helped the U.S. military outfox the Japanese during World War II by sending messages in their obscure language, has died, the president of the Navajo Nation said. ""This news has saddened me,"" Ben Shelly, the Navajo president, said in a post Wednesday on his Facebook page. ""Our Navajo code talkers have been real life heroes to generations of Navajo people."" Smith died Tuesday, Shelly said, and the Navajo Nation's flag is flying at half-staff until Sunday night to commemorate his life. See CNN's complete coverage of Veterans in Focus . Several hundred Navajo tribe members served as code talkers for the United States during World War II, using a military communications code based on the Navajo language. They sent messages back and forth from the front lines of fighting, relaying crucial information during pivotal battles like Iwo Jima. Military authorities chose Navajo as a code language because it was almost impossible for a non-Navajo to learn and had no written form. It was the only code the Japanese never managed to crack. The Navajo code talkers participated in every assault the U.S. Marines carried out in the Pacific between 1942 and 1945. The code talkers themselves were forbidden from telling anyone about the code -- not their fellow Marines, not their families -- until it was declassified in 1968. Now in their 80s and 90s, only a handful of code talkers remain. ""They have brought pride to our Navajo people in so many ways,"" Shelly said. ""The nation's prayers and thoughts are with the family at this time as they mourn the passing of a great family man who served his country and protected his people."" Shelly's Facebook post didn't mention Smith's age or the cause and location of his death.

"(CNN) -- A NASA spacecraft carrying a Mars rover was in ""excellent health"" Saturday more than two hours after it began its eight-and-a-half-month journey. The mission began at Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a clean liftoff. The spacecraft sent a signal after separation from the rocket, NASA said. Upon arrival after its 354 million-mile trip, the rover will collect rocks and soil on the Red Planet to see if there are signs of life -- in the form of organic material. The rover, dubbed ""Curiosity,"" is scheduled to land August 6, 2012. It will be lowered by tether to Gale Crater. If water ever existed on Mars, scientists say, it would have been in the crater. ""Curiosity"" will help determine whether an area on the planet ""has ever been a potential habitat for Martian life,"" NASA says. ""This sets up the future of finally answering that age-old question: Does life exist on other planets?"" said deputy project manager Ashwin Vasavada. The mission will last one Martian year, which is 687 Earth days, NASA says. The rover, about the size of a compact car, weighs 1 ton and has a 7-foot arm that will be used to collect material. ""On Mars, if life exists as single cell-organisms, or if it ever existed, we believe it will be under the ground, or inside rocks,"" said mission chief engineer Rob Manning. The project costs $2.5 billion. CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.","NEW: Spacecraft in ""excellent health"" as it flies toward Mars .

"(CNN) -- The Commonwealth Games was hit by a fresh doping scandal Saturday after former world 400m champion Amantle Montsho of Botswana failed a drugs test. Montsho, who was the defending her Commonwealth title in Glasgow over her specialist distance, tested positive after Tuesday's final for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine. The 31-year-old had finished a disappointing fourth at Hampden Park behind a Jamaican clean sweep led by Stephanie McPherson. A statement from the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) said: ""In accordance with the CGF anti-doping standard for the Commonwealth Games, the CGF federation court conducted a provisional hearing this afternoon to consider an adverse analytical finding submitted by Amantle Montsho of Botswana, after the women's 400 metres final on July 29. ""The athlete's A sample was found to contain methylhexaneamine, prohibited as a stimulant under class s6 of WADA's Prohibited List. ""Ms Montsho was notified of her A sample result and has asked for her B sample to be tested, which will take place at the accredited laboratory in London on Monday August 4."" Montsho was feted in Botswana after claiming the Commonwealth Games crown in Delhi in 2010 and she built on that success to take the world title in 2011. She finished second to Britain's Christine Ohuruogu in her defense of that title in Berlin last year and came into the Glasgow Games as one of the favorites.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich started where they left off last season by beating Wolfsburg 2-1 in the curtain raise to the German Bundesliga. But the German champions, who ran away with the 2013/214 league title, were pegged back for long periods of the game and can count themselves lucky not have conceded a chance late on that Junior Malanda somehow missed from inches out. Pep Guardiola's side was missing a host of first team starters with Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery, Thiago, Javi Martinez and Jerome Boateng all absent thanks to a mixture of injuries and suspensions. That meant that Guardiola was forced to hand 17 year old Gianluca Gaudino his first ever Bayern start. Yet it was Wolfsburg that were the most impressive in the opening stages until German international Thomas Mueller stabbed home and gave Bayern the lead before half time. And things got worse for Wolfsburg when Arjen Robben, in scintillating form and showing no signs of fatigue after an excellent World Cup this summer for The Netherlands, sprinted through and placed his shot in the net. Wolfsburg quickly replied through the veteran Croatia striker Ivica Olic, who curled home a wonderful long range shot into the top left hand corner past a beaten Manuel Neuer. But the match will perhaps be best remembered for what will surely go down as one of the misses of the season, even at this early stage. Belgian midfielder Malanda forced a superb save from Neuer, who deflected his shot on to the bar. The rebound hit Malanda, standing on the line, and it rolled harmlessly wide. After that, Bayern held on for the perfect start to the season. PSG held . Meanwhile in France, Paris Saint Germain continued their stuttering start to the season with a 0-0 draw against Evian after seeing new signing Yohan Cabaye sent off. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic and captain Thiago Silva out injured, and Thiago Motta, who was on the receiving end of a vicious headbutt after PSG's 2-0 win over Bastia last week, only on the bench, the champions couldn't break a resolute Evian down. PSG had most of the possession and play until the 62nd minute when Cabaye, a summer signing from Newcastle United who has been on an extended break since representing France at this summer's World Cup, was sent off for a second bookable offense. Life got easier for Evian after the sending off and they might have snatched victory at the death when Nicolas Benezet's shot was kept out by Italian goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. Despite being one of the richest clubs in the world after their Qatari buy out, PSG have now drawn two and won one of their first three games and will be counting the days until Ibrahimovich returns. Late start in Spain . In Spain the second leg of the Super Cup between Atletico Madrid and Read Madrid was was due to kick off at the Vincent Calderon late Friday. The first leg between the Madrid rivals ended 1-1.","Bayern Munich beat Wolfsburg 2-1 .

"(CNN) -- Three Delaware teenagers charged earlier this month after being accused of beating a mentally disabled man are now charged with a hate crime. The state's prosecutor filed the additional, weightier charges on Monday, according to a press release. ""It is our responsibility to protect people who cannot protect themselves,"" Attorney General Beau Biden said in the release. ""Targeting and assaulting a vulnerable victim is especially egregious and those who do so face significant consequences under the law. Every parent needs to talk with their children about this incident and how to prevent these types of crimes."" In addition to the hate crime, the teenage boys also face further felony charges, including crime against a vulnerable adult and abuse of an impaired adult, according to the press release. One 14-year-old boy from Newark, Delaware, turned himself in and two other teenagers were first arrested earlier this month after videos of the assault went viral on social media. The three teens were initially charged with misdemeanors. Because of their age, the boys' names are not being made public. The beatings occurred several weeks ago but more recently angered viewers across the nation after videos of the incidents were posted on social media with the hashtags #JusticeForCoran and #TheBullyProject. In one video, the man, who police said is 26 years old and suffers from a neurodevelopmental disorder, is chased around the yard of an apartment complex as he yells, ""Leave me alone."" A teenage boy in shorts and a T-shirt body-slams him to the ground, then punches and stomps the man. The man's family told CNN affiliate KYW that he suffers from Williams syndrome and that he takes his little sister to the bus stop. In a second video, shot in a wooded area, the man is again body-slammed and punched while lying on the ground. A girl in the crowd says, ""You guys are mean to him."" The man stands and other boys punch and push him to the ground. As the man lies crying in the weeds, a boy jumps in front of the camera and mimics the question the man kept asking: ""What I do? What I do?"" ""It's more than disgusting. There's no words to describe what they did,"" the victim's stepmother told KYW. She said he trusted the group of teens and believed they were his friends, and now he is suffering emotionally and physically.

"Miami (CNN) -- Luis Posada Carriles told CNN recently he would ""be gentle"" with a newspaper reporter who accused him of masterminding decades of violent terrorist attacks in Central America, several to overthrow Fidel Castro. Known as ""Bambi"" by his Miami-Cuban supporters, the octogenarian fighter turned fugitive had harsher words for Fidel Castro, his lifetime foe. ""If he walked through that door, I would kill him,"" Posada said. But far from a docile fawn, critics say, Posada is behind a string of hotel bombings and other deadly attacks in Latin America, including the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner that killed 73 people on board. He denies all allegations. Still wanted by Venezuela and Cuba for ""terrorist acts,"" Posada, who lives with his family in Miami, said he was elated when a jury in El Paso, Texas, found him not guilty earlier this month on 11 counts ranging from perjury to subversion. ""It was hugely emotional to hear it, 'not guilty, not guilty, not guilty, not guilty' 11 times,"" he said. ""What more can I say?  It is a country of justice."" Venezuela has dismissed as ""farce"" the Texas jury's decision to acquit  Posada, who faced charges of lying to U.S. immigration officials and involvement in attacks on Cuba. If convicted, he would have faced five to eight years in prison. Posada's reclusive and elusive life story as a U.S. protegee and eventually a diplomatic liability is a sore point in the history of U.S. relations with Latin America. Born in Cuba, Posada dedicated his life to anti-Marxist, anti-Castro covert activities. Wanted by some nations and sheltered by others, Posada's journeys through some Latin American nations during civil wars illustrate the checkered political map of the region as the U.S. sought to undermine Marxist movements in Central America, many backed by Cuba's Castro regime. Posada became a CIA operative in the 1960s after leaving Cuba. In the 1970s, he was working for the Venezuelan secret police when the Cubana Airlines flight blew up, killing 73. Suspects arrested identified Posada as one of the plotters. Posada was jailed for nine years in Venezuela, but he was never convicted and escaped in 1985. He denies all charges. ""In the beginning, as the chief of operations for the Venezuelan Police, Cuba disembarked three generals on Venezuelan soil,"" Posada told CNN en Espanol anchor Fernando Rincon. ""The operation against these people was a violent one. It was the only way to suppress a Communist incursion into Venezuela,"" he said. Posada received CIA training in explosives and sabotage at Fort Benning, Georgia, after helping to organize the failed Bay of Pigs operation to oust Castro in 1961. He said he stopped working for the CIA in 1968 but in the 1980s helped the U.S.-backed secret Contra supply network in Central America. According to CIA declassified files, Posada enlisted fighters to overthrow the Guatemalan government in 1965 and other covert, anti-Communist activities throughout the region. The declassified CIA documents allege he organized large shipments of ammunition and weaponry throughout. In El Salvador in the mid-1980s, Posada told CNN, he became a presidential protegee when he helped the government fight Marxist guerrillas. ""I had a presidential minder greet me,"" Posada said. ""I had support from the military."" Posada was also implicated in a string of terrorist bombings in Cuba in 1997 that killed 11 people in a tourist area. A senior official familiar with Posada's career said the CIA considers him ""radioactive"" and said he is no longer linked to the agency. But Posada, now celebrating his victory in U.S. courts, said he would give his life to Cuba but  sees no reason to fight. ""I don't need to engage in the armed struggle against Cuba,"" Posada told CNN. ""The battle against Cuba has already been won. They don't exist anymore. They are falling to pieces,"" he said. CNN's Fernando Rincon and Helena de Moura contributed to this report.","Anti-Castro activist Luis Posada Carriles was acquitted by U.S. court .

"(CNN) -- What does it take to become the CEO of India's biggest biotech company and the richest woman in India? Mazumdar Shaw with Shah Rukh Khan. India's richest woman is ready to answer your questions. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, founder of biotech pharaceutical company Biotech answers your questions, below. Yours is a very inspiring story. Could you tell us more about what challenges you had to overcome to bring Biocon to a global level? Vishala Vasandani . Mazumdar Shaw: My journey started 30 years ago at a time when I had to face credibility challenges that pertained to my gender, my inexperience as a business entrepreneur and my unfamiliar biotechnology-based business model. My business evolved in tandem with challenges. Once I overcame these credibility challenges, I faced technological challenges of trying to build a Biotech business in a country that had infrastructure that was too primitive to support a high tech industry that demanded uninterrupted power supply, high quality water, sterile labs, imported research equipment, advanced scientific skills etc. Over the next 10 years, we systematically addressed these challenges and built a self contained enterprise that had captive power and water supply, state of the art labs and facilities and a team of highly experienced scientists and engineers capable of delivering world class research and technologies. Today, our challenges address those posed by new medical wisdom: addressing unmet medical needs, researching new drugs, new drug delivery systems and new therapies. Overcoming each of these phases has been a rich learning experience that has helped us to develop world class expertise in biotechnology. Innovation and quality have been integral to our business ethos. Can Biocon's oral insulin IN-105 replace traditional and painful needle based insulin delivery system for type1 diabetics? Can a diabetic who is taking insulin by needle based delivery system hope for change in near future?  Ajay Kumar Singh . Mazumdar-Shaw: Oral Insulin is not just about delivering Insulin in a tablet. It is about delivering Insulin very rapidly to the liver (hepato-delivery) which is the main organ responsible for glycemic control in our body. Injectable Insulin takes approximately 30 minutes to act. Oral Insulin takes approximately 5 minutes to act which mimics how non-diabetics respond to glucose uptake when food is consumed. This will help both Type I and Type II diabetics to manage their diabetes better. We hope that early intervention with Oral Insulin will help to manage Diabetes especially in Type II diabetics much more effectively than is being done by oral diabetic agents like Metformin, Sulphonyl Ureas and Glitazones which stimulate the pancreas to produce Insulin. This is unlike oral Insulin which will allow a poorly functioning pancreas to rest and hopefully help to revive Insulin secreting beta cells. Should our Oral Insulin program succeed, this will revolutionize Diabetes therapy in the future. If you had to do the IPO again what would you do differently and when can we see Biocon listed in NASDAQ?  Harish Swaminathan . Mazumdar-Shaw: I don't believe so. I think we got the valuation we were expecting through an Indian listing. A NASDAQ listing is only something we will address when one of our branded drugs are close to commercialization in either the U.S. or European markets. Today NASDAQ is risk averse and not valuing biotech companies any better than the BSE or NSE. I am so humbled by your story. What does it take as a woman to get to where you are today? What obstacles did you have to overcome, especially in an industry that is deemed to be a ""man's world""? Would women setting up business in India today find it easier than you did? Irene Gonza, Uganda . Mazumdar-Shaw: I believe that women need to believe in themselves. I set up Biocon with a spirit of challenge and a deep sense of purpose. The challenge was to break the gender bias in the business world. My sense of purpose was to create a Biotech business in a country like India which had a very poor research culture with limited opportunities for scientists and engineers to pursue a career. It was about stopping the ""brain drain"" from India. It was about providing exciting career opportunities to young scientists and engineers. It was about encouraging young women to pursue careers. When one is passionate about a mission that is about change, it enables you to persevere and endure. I do believe that if I could achieve success, any woman can overcome obstacles with a sense of determination! When you set up Biocon did you aim to make it one of the biggest and most successful in the world? Do you need ambition like that be a success in any kind of business or does it take luck, too?  David James, London . Mazumdar-Shaw: When I set up Biocon, I certainly did not have such a big ambition! I basically wanted to run a successful and profitable business to start with. Ambition is evolutionary and one does not see the big picture until you reach a certain critical mass. It was only a few years ago that we developed a global ambition and built global scale in our operations. Whilst luck can be described as ""being at the right place at the right time"" or ""being prepared to address an opportunity,"" I personally believe that it is about being able to seize opportunities by leveraging existing capabilities to reach new levels. In our case, we leveraged our enzyme capabilities to pursue bio-pharmaceuticals; it was also about picking the right products (statins & Insulin) that had large markets. We chose to partner with innovative companies and in-license innovative technologies which spearheaded our new drug development programs. We have always chosen to differentiate ourselves from the market and this has allowed us to ""think out of the box"" and stand apart. How do you think the global economic downturn will affect Biocon and Indian companies in general?  Alicia van Waveren, The Hague . Mazumdar-Shaw: The economic meltdown will certainly bring tremendous pricing pressure and we expect to see our margins shrink. We also expect payment terms that involve extended credits. However, we also see a silver lining amidst this gloomy scenario as R&D and manufacturing are likely to shift to countries like India in order to bring down costs. We have two subsidiaries that offer research and clinical services, Syngene and Clinigene that are likely to see their businesses increase. We also expect generic drugs to become a larger part of healthcare budgets in western economies. Finally, new drug development costs are under tremendous pressure both in terms of funding and development. India and companies like Biocon provide very effective co-development partnership opportunities to bring these costs down. The differences between wealth and poverty in India are starker than anywhere else in the world. Do you think the poverty gap will ever be closed?  Richard Ng, Hong Kong . Mazumdar-Shaw: Poverty poses a huge challenge. Education and employment are the only answers. India is striving to address these two areas through various education and vocational training initiatives. What we also need is employment generation through a myriad of projects that span infrastructure development, co-operative agriculture to entrepreneurship. India needs to provide rural connectivity both in terms of roads and tale/IT connectivity. This will unleash inclusive growth in a huge way. Today we are caught between a political ethos that finds it convenient to keep its vote bank ignorant and unemployed and a civic India that wants to educate and harness the potential of its human capital. It seems that Indian biotech and pharmaceutical industry is relying more on being the outsourced resource of the U.S. and EU companies rather than creating their own intellectual property.Do you think this a culture in India to not be active in creating IP or is it related to the inadequacies in the patent law?  Dipanjan Nag . Mazumdar-Shaw: A very correct observation. The risks associated with proprietary products are high and Indian businesses and more importantly Indian investors and banks are extremely risk averse. Hopefully, the rapid commoditization of generics and services will force companies to differentiate on the basis of IP. At Biocon we strongly believe that our proprietary programs will help us sustain growth in the future. It is a challenge to convince our investors of this but we think they will understand this in the near future. In hindsight, what is the one piece of advice you wish you'd been given when you were starting out in business?  Karl Malone, Winchester . Risk is not about taking but about managing. I took a huge risk when I started a Biotech company in 1978 and I soon realized that I had to manage the risk by addressing very serious challenges of a very primitive infrastructure at the time. It took me a lot longer than I thought to build the company but in hindsight it was still worth the effort! What drives you to achieve what you have and to keep going when times are tough?  Melinda Cook, Melbourne . The belief that we can deliver the world's first Oral Insulin and other life saving drugs for cancer and auto-immune diseases. I am driven by my desire to see novel drugs being developed by Biocon for global markets with a ""Made in India"" label. I am determined to see India earn a strong reputation in innovation. At a time when most Biotech companies in the western world are challenged with funding, I believe we can forge ahead and succeed. About Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw . Mazumdar-Shaw is founder of Biocon, the biotech and pharmaceutical company that made her India's richest self-made businesswoman. She was named as one of Fortune magazine's 50 Most Powerful Women in 2007 and was instrumental in forging India's biotechnology industry. Living and working in Bangalore, she set up Biocon in 1978 and has developed it into a global biopharmaceutical player with highly developed research and development facilities focusing on cancer and diabetes treatments. Biocon was bought first by Unilever in 1989 and then sold to ICI in 1997, but Mazumdar-Shaw remains the company's Chair and Managing Director and has been part of the Indian government's Council on Trade & Industry.","India's richest woman Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw is founder and CEO of Biocon .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A top Taliban political leader delivered a message Friday to President Obama, calling his attempt to lure away Taliban fighters with money ""an old weapon that has failed already."" ""The Mujahedeen of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan are not mercenaries and employed gunmen like the armed men of the invaders and their surrogates,"" Mullah Brader Akhund said in the statement. ""This war will come to an end when all invaders leave our country and an Islamic government based on the aspirations of our people is formed in the country."" Akhund is the deputy emir of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which is the political arm of the Taliban. He was referring to the Taliban reintegration provision, part of the $680 billion defense appropriation bill that Obama signed Wednesday to pay for military operations in the 2010 fiscal year. The provision would separate local Taliban from their leaders, paying the fighters to quit the organization, replicating a program used to neutralize the insurgency against Americans in Iraq, according to the Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Akhund said 19th century British invaders and Soviet fighters in the 1980s tried the same tactic, unsuccessfully. He said the Taliban consider the U.S. measure ""a sign of weakness and complete despondency of the enemy."" Obama is considering whether to approve the request from his top commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, for as many as 40,000 additional troops in Afghanistan. The decision is being weighed against the backdrop of suddenly spiraling U.S. military fatalities. Fifty-six American troops have died in Afghanistan in October, the highest U.S. monthly toll since the war began eight years ago. Obama meets Friday with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who will tell the U.S. leader how a large deployment to Afghanistan would affect the military. Akhund warned Obama against maintaining a military presence in Afghanistan, saying it ""will only deepen your economic crisis and will harm your international reputation."" ""Pull all your forces out of our prideful country and put an end to the game of colonialization by shedding the blood of innocent Muslim people under the unjustified name of terrorism,"" he said. The Taliban reintegration provision is part of the Commander's Emergency Response Program, which is now receiving $1.3 billion. CERP funding also is intended for humanitarian relief and reconstruction projects at commanders' discretion. ""Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal,"" Levin said in a Senate floor speech on September 11. ""They believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us."" While the plan has a ""reasonable chance for some success,"" analyst Nicholas Schmidle said that it may not be a long-term solution. ""So long as the Americans are keenly aware of this, you're buying a very, very, very temporary allegiance,"" said Schmidle, an expert on the Afghanistan-Pakistan region for the nonpartisan New America Foundation. ""If that's the foundation for moving forward, it's a shaky foundation."" Peter Bergen, CNN security analyst, said the idea of paying off Taliban members to quit is nothing new. ""There's been an amnesty program for low-level Taliban in place for many years now, and thousands of people have taken advantage of it,"" he said. ""So this is not entirely a new idea. The idea of bribing people, local guys, to come over. ... It's one of the most cost-effective ways to get people to lay down their arms, either to negotiate a peace or coerce them."" McChrystal has backed the Taliban reintegration plan, saying that most are not ideologically or even politically motivated. ""Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with [a] foreign cadre with them,"" he said in a July 28 Los Angeles Times interview. ""Most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders."" CNN's Ed Hornick, Thomas Evans, Adam Levine, Barbara Starr and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","Mullah Brader Akhund calls the strategy ""an old weapon that has failed already""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities said Thursday that they have suspended a police officer who is accused of beating the U.S. teenager Tariq Abu Khdeir in Jerusalem last week. Amateur video emerged last week showing Israeli police officers holding down and punching 15-year-old Khdeir, a high school sophomore from Florida. The shocking footage prompted outrage from his family and calls by the U.S. government for a full and transparent investigation. Khdeir says he was arrested and accosted while watching violent protests in the Shuafat neighborhood last week over the kidnapping and killing of his cousin, the Palestinian teenager Mohammed Abu Khedair. The young man's killing came after three abducted Israeli teenagers were found dead in a field in the West Bank, sparking an upsurge in tensions in the region. Israeli authorities say Khdeir was among a group of youths who attacked police during the riots. He is currently under house arrest at a relative's home after being released on bail by a court. The Israeli Department for the Investigation of Police (DIP) said Thursday that after an investigation into the incident, it had found evidence to suspect one of the officers of committing ""serious violent offenses"" while Khdeir was handcuffed. The department's director is considering criminal charges against the officer, who is in a special undercover unit, and he has been summoned for a hearing, the agency said in a statement. The officer's suspension is for 15 days. But the DIP also said Khdeir was identified by police as wearing a mask, carrying a slingshot and taking an active part in the unrest in Shuafat. Khdeir and his family have denied he did anything wrong. ""I was attacked by police. I woke up in the hospital,"" he said as he walked out of court in Jerusalem on Sunday, sporting two black eyes and a swollen lip. ""I just saw somebody running at me, so I tried to run away,"" he told reporters. Khdeir said he didn't know why he was attacked. His mother has said the family intends to sue Israeli authorities over the matter. CNN's Tal Heinrich reported from Jerusalem, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","NEW: An Israeli police officer is suspected of committing ""serious violent offenses""

"(CNN) -- Iggy Azalea would love it if everyone channeled ""Frozen"" and just ""let it go."" The Australian rapper has broken her silence about a supposed feud between herself and Nicki Minaj, rumors that were sparked after Minaj gave a curiously pointed acceptance speech at the BET Awards on Sunday. The New York-bred MC made it clear that when ""you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it,"" leaving observers to assume that she was taking a dig at Azalea, who's been rumored to work with ghostwriters and was Minaj's competitor at the awards ceremony. Nicki Minaj vs. Iggy Azalea: Where's the beef? Although Minaj said during her acceptance speech that she wasn't giving ""shade"" -- aka, disrespect -- it nonetheless appeared that way to many. With the Internet chomping down on the apparent beef, both Minaj and Azalea have tried to clear the air. ""The media puts words in my mouth all the time and this is no different. I will always take a stance on women writing b/c I believe in us!"" Minaj tweeted on July 2. ""I've congratulated Iggy on the success of 'Fancy,' publicly. She should be very proud of that. All the women nominated should b proud. ... That will never change my desire to motivate women to write. Our voices have to be heard. I hope I inspire up & coming females to do that."" Azalea initially remained silent on the subject, but by July 3 the rapper had grown tired of the commentary. ""I have to say the general explosion of pettiness online in the last few days is hard to ignore and honestly ... lame,"" Azalea wrote in a statement, as captured on her Instagram account. ""If I had won the BET award that would've been great but it wasn't my year and I don't mind -- so you shouldn't either."" And that's not all: ""Generally speaking,"" Azalea continued, ""I'm unbothered by anything that 'happened' at the BET awards, and just feel worn out by everyone trying to make me have wars with people all the time. Anyone who wishes me well is welcome in my life and those who don't can't get any more of my time.

"(EW.com ) -- And EW's Entertainer of the Year is...Sandra Bullock! She is the gift that keeps on giving. First the 49-year-old Oscar winner teamed up with the uproarious Melissa McCarthy in Paul Feig's winning buddy cop comedy The Heat. Then, as Dr. Ryan Stone in Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, Bullock gives an emotionally naked performance that will likely earn her an Oscar nomination. Bullock's tremendous talent and range â€” to say nothing of the woman's trademark grace and good humor in good times and bad â€” is what earned her the top spot on our annual list of the most exciting performers in 2013. EW: Tom Hanks plays 'Chopsticks' with Sandra Bullock . Bullock's one-two punch demanded a fair amount of give and take from the actor. When she signed on to The Heat Bullock didn't expect to be playing straight man to McCarthy's firehose-blast of a performance. ""Once I realized that that drove the film I had to step back,"" she says. ""Otherwise I would've been fighting for something that would've ended up on the cutting room floor. It wasn't what I was hoping for but the end result was the success of the film and people liking us together."" While Bullock nixes any talk of The Heat 2, she says she's keen for another project with her fast friend McCarthy. (Hollywood, get on this!) EW: Sandra Bullock's likeability meter goes up and up in 'Vogue' She was a true collaborator on Gravity as well. It was her idea for instance that her character Dr. Ryan Stone was in a raw state of mourning for her dead child. (Originally, the script called for her character to have a child waiting for her back on Earth.) ""What if she had absolutely nothing to fight for?"" Bullock says she proposed. ""She's lost a child, there's nothing back home, she's a person who's basically a machine. That was my idea and Alfonso was so open to it."" And as for squashing talk of another Gravity, Bullock appreciated Cuaron's alternate ending idea of George Clooney falling from the sky on top of her at the end. ""The last scene you just see us on top of each other, limbs everywhere,"" she imagines with a laugh. ""Our hands intertwine with our last breath of air and we die on top of each other clutching the Earth."" Sandra Bullock is joined by 15 more Entertainers of the Year, including the masterminds behind Breaking Bad, Dallas Buyers Club star Matthew McConaughey, girl on fire Jennifer Lawrence, a very Grumpy Cat, and more.

"(CNN) -- Stacking building blocks is a popular way for children to fight boredom. Now stacking food cans has become part of a national campaign to fight hunger. An Atlanta-based organization called Canstruction challenges architects, engineers and volunteers to make sculptures by using cans of food. The late Cheri Melillo founded Canstruction in 1992 in New York after seeing similar exhibits in Denver and Seattle. One year later, she started the first competition in New York. Canstruction coordinates relief efforts with dozens of cities around the United States, from Long Beach, California, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The exhibits are held in public places such as malls, convention centers or even state fairs. The idea is that volunteers are able to raise supplies for food banks and simultaneously raise awareness of the problem of hunger throughout the United States. A 2012 U.S. Department of Agriculture report estimated there are around 49 million people who live in ""food insecure"" households (meaning anyone who is at risk of hunger or may not have consistent access to food.) Of that total, 8.3 million are children. Canstruction has collected more than 25 million pounds of food since its first competition more than 20 years ago. ""It's important for us that we continue to get the word out,"" said Jennifer Schaefer, chair of the Canstruction competition in Phoenix, ""so people are aware of the hunger issues that we have, not only here in Arizona but across the country because it's a big issue."" Judges grade the exhibits on their structural design, attention to detail, creativity and level of difficulty. When the event is over, the cans are donated to local food pantries. ""It's a really creative outlet for people,"" Schaefer said. ""It's a huge event, and it's just a lot of fun for all of us."" The idea of Canstruction is pretty simple. Making one? Not so much. Groups of five to 10 people start planning and designing months before the event. They are responsible for finding can labels with colors that match their design as well as raising enough money to pay for them. Canstruction's motto to solving hunger is ""one can at a time,"" but some projects, such as the Phoenix best use of label winner from 2013, included as many as 7,000 cans -- all tuna. It was four-sided, one with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., one with Mother Teresa, one with Abraham Lincoln and one with a large QR code. The time limit for building varies. But most groups finish their designs within seven hours, depending on the number of cans and the complexity of the project. Despite the sinuous arcs and bends that seemingly defy gravity, the use of glue, leveling boards and most other foreign objects are prohibited. ""You can use materials for leveling purposes, such as up to a quarter-inch plywood or Plexiglas or cardboard,"" said Sarah Barnard, co-chair of the Syracuse, New York, event. ""But those structures should be self-supporting out of cans. They discourage the use of props of any kind -- not taping eyes onto something but trying to use the labels to create the effect."" The culmination of months of planning, designing, fund-raising and, finally, building is a completed product of which the ""architects"" can be proud. But what goes up must come down. After a few weeks on display, the cans are ""de-canstructed"" and transported to charity. Like the feeling of slicing up a colorful cake you don't want to cut into, the emotion of clearing away the cans can be bittersweet. ""It's a little sad to see all of that hard work come back down,"" Barnard said. ""But since we know that all of the food is going to a great cause, I think it makes it a little bit better."" Proceeds of the Syracuse event go to the Food Bank of Central New York. Barnard said its workers are happy to have a large donation around the beginning of September. The number of charitable donations spike during major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas. But the need for hunger relief continues year-round, even after the holiday spirit goes away. ""You always hear the news reports -- the food bank is having trouble or the food bank has a deficit,"" said Jessica Sappington, chair of the Syracuse Canstruction event. Sappington's modest goal? ""Maybe one less news report a year that the food bank is struggling.""","Around 49 million Americans are ""food insecure,"" Department of Agriculture report says .

"(CNN) -- A volunteer assistant football coach at Steubenville High School in Ohio is expected to plead no contest Tuesday to two of the four counts he faces in connection with the rape case in the town that captured national attention, a spokesman with the state attorney general's office said. Matt Belardine was charged with four misdemeanors: allowing underage drinking, obstructing official business, making a false statement and contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a child. He will plead no contest to serving alcohol to a minor and falsification, Dan Tierney, spokesman for the Ohio Attorney General's Office, told CNN on Monday. The other two counts are expected to be dismissed, Tierney said. A judge would then decide whether to find Belardine guilty or not guilty. She would then have the option to sentence Belardine or order a pre-sentencing hearing, the spokesman said. The counts to which Belardine is expected to plead each carry a six-month maximum sentence, said Tierney, adding that the judge has a great deal of discretion. William Rhinaman, the director of technology for Steubenville City Schools, is also expected to appear in court Tuesday for a pre-trial hearing. He has been indicted on charges of tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice, obstructing official business and perjury. In January, one of two former high school football players convicted in the rape that shook the eastern Ohio community of Steubenville was released from juvenile detention. Ma'lik Richmond was 16 when he was convicted last year of raping a 16-year-old girl in Steubenville. Richmond had been sentenced to a minimum of one year in a juvenile correctional facility, but he was credited for the time he served before the trial. Richmond and Steubenville High School football teammate Trenton Mays were convicted in March 2013 of the rape after a trial that divided the football-crazed Rust Belt town. Lurid text messages, social media posts, as well as cell phone pictures and videos helped raise the national profile of the case, which revolved around Richmond and Mays' actions during a series of end-of-summer parties in August 2012. It attracted the attention of bloggers, who questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the integrity of the investigation. Mays, who was 17 when he was convicted, also was found guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor and was sentenced to two years. Both Richmond and Mays have been classified as Tier II sex offenders and will be required to report to their local sheriff's office every six months for the next 20 years.","Matt Belardine is set to plead no contest to serving alcohol to a minor and falsification .

"(CNN) -- In the end, enigma swirled around Moammar Gadhafi in death just as it had in life, the grisly details of his demise still emerging. Libya's new leaders said he was caught in a crossfire although several cell phone videos seemed to contradict that report. Based on NATO officials, journalists, human rights monitors and witnesses, here is an account of how the strongman's last day transpired. Revolutionary fighters had cornered Gadhafi loyalists in the District 2 area of Sirte. There had been rumors that he was holed up in the city of his birth but speculation also held that he had fled to the desert. In any case, NATO surveillance drones and National Transitional Council commanders had been keeping an eye on District 2 for a while and again on Thursday morning, the drones were out. Somewhere around 8:30 in the morning, according to a NATO official, a convoy of loyalists made a break from that part of Sirte and headed west trying to get out of the city. U.S. drones and French fighter jets struck the convoy, splitting it up and forcing the loyalists to scurry on foot. It's not clear whether Gadhafi was in that convoy but a NATO official said he was, though he was not directly hit. ""Two miles west of Sirte, 15 pickup trucks mounted with machine guns lay burnt out, smashed and smoldering next to an electricity substation 20 meters from the main road,"" reported the Reuters news agency. The revolutionaries began shooting at the loyalists. ""At first we fired at them with anti-aircraft guns, but it was no use,"" Salem Bakeer told Reuters. ""Then we went in on foot."" The ferocious firefight lasted three hours, said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, who is in Sirte. He said 95 bodies were found in the area. Gadhafi survived and fled with a handful of his men. The revolutionaries eventually found him hiding in a drainage pipe. Misrata fighter Omran Shaaban told The New York Times that Gadhafi was bleeding from his head and chest but still was able to speak with his trademark indignation. Bakeer told Reuters that Gadhafi was wounded with gunshots in his leg and back. Some accounts described him as confused. Others said he pleaded for his life. ""When he saw us, he said, 'What's happening? Those were the words he spoke,"" Shaaban told the Times. There were bodies strewn about the 70-feet long chunk of drab, concrete tubing that passed under a road. On it, graffiti scribbled in blue lettering read: ""This is the place of the rat, Gadhafi. God is great."" It was, of course, Gadhafi who called the rebels rats from the very start of Libya's uprising in February. They had finally caught him. Now it was Gadhafi, the self-styled ""king of kings"" of Africa who was caught like a rat amid rubbish and rocks and sand . He was captured alive. But that's when the stories diverge. The National Transitional Council's leadership says Gadhafi was killed in crossfire between revolutionary fighters and the remnants of loyalists in Sirte. Mohammed Sayeh, a senior member of the council, told CNN that Gadhafi was being transported to Misrata to the northwest. ""They were taking him to a hospital,"" he said. In the hail of gunfire, Sayeh said, Gadhafi was shot in the feet and then in his head. ""I cannot tell you whether it was from far or near, but it was unintentional,"" he said. ""No one decided to kill him or slaughter him. It would have been much better for us Libyans and the whole universe to capture him and take him to a court."" But cell phone videos and other accounts seem to contradict Sayeh's statement. And questions remain about when and exactly how Gadhafi died. One man told the BBC that he saw Gadhafi being shot with a 9mm gun in the abdomen at around 12:30 p.m. That was four hours before the National Transitional Council's executive board Chairman Mahmoud Jibril announced that Gadhafi was dead. Ibrahim Tika, a doctor who allegedly performed DNA tests on Gadhafi's body Friday, told Al Arabiya television that Gadhafi was shot in the head and stomach. Bouckaert said he did not believe Gadhafi was killed in crossfire. From what Human Rights Watch has learned, Bouckaert said Gadhafi did not have a gunshot wound in his head when he was captured. ""He was taken into the streets,"" he said. ""Enraged crowds started beating him, pulling his hair. They tried to put him on a hood of a car and drive him away. He fell off."" In a shaky amateur video, a bloodied Gadhafi is seen alive and being hoisted onto a truck. Another, obtained by the Al-Jazeera network, showed his corpse on the ground, a bullet wound in his head. A third piece of footage posted on YouTube showed fighters grabbing Gadhafi's tangled curls and jerking his head about. ""It certainly was a very humiliating end for Gadhafi,"" Bouckaert said. ""But when he left this area he was very much alive.""The The different versions of how Gadhafi met his end prompted the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International to ask for investigations. Bouckaert said an autopsy on his body ought to be internationally supervised. For weeks, the revolutionaries had been on the forefront of the battle for Sirte, struggling to wrest control of the coastal city from the last vestiges of the old regime in brutal urban warfare. Thursday, when the fight was finally won, they could finally claim liberation for their nation. They waved Gadhafi's golden gun in the air. The revolutionaries also took Gadhafi's satellite phone, his brown scarf and one black boot, the Times reported, to keep as ultimate trophies of their victory. But their first day of freedom, said Bouckaert, is now blemished with the suspicious circumstances of the former tyrant's death. Friday, Gadhafi's bloody, battered body lay on a mattress in a Misrata market cold storage room, Reuters reported. The news agency showed video of curious onlookers snapping pictures with their mobile phones. It was unclear when and how he would be put to rest, even though Muslim rites require burial within 24 hours. Mahmoud al-Shammam, the National Transitional Council's information minister, told CNN that a funeral would be postponed for a few days just in case officials from the International Criminal Court -- which had an arrest warrant out for Gadhafi for alleged crimes against humanity -- wanted to see the body firsthand. In his 42 years in power, Gadhafi embraced eccentric tactics and cold-blooded violence, meting out cruel forms of punishment to those he perceived as his enemies. He should have faced justice in court, many Libyans as well as human rights activists said. Instead, he was like many of his victims whose ignominious end raised plenty of questions.","Moammar Gadhafi was in a convoy heading out of Sirte that was hit by NATO .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan is facing its most serious political crisis in years, with rapidly escalating conflicts between the civilian government, the military and the judiciary, against the backdrop of a faltering economy, widespread poverty, corruption and the bloody war with Islamist militant groups. The country was founded in 1947 as a democracy, but in times of crisis the army -- Pakistan's most powerful institution -- has overthrown the civilian government on the grounds that the leadership had been unfit and corrupt. Rumors of another coup have been swirling around the current crisis -- but analysts say a military takeover is highly unlikely this time around. Here are five reasons why: . 1. The people won't support a military take over . Pakistanis support a strong military for defense and security-related issues, but analysts say a history of failed military dictators has sapped much of the public's confidence in the army's ability to solve Pakistan's political problems. The reigns of military leaders like Generals Ayub Khan, Zia Ul Haq, and, most recently, Pervez Musharraf, were plagued by accusations of corruption and ineffective leadership. ""It has become far more difficult for a military takeover to take place because of public opinion,"" says Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, the head of Pakistan's Institute for Legislative Development and Transparency, an Islamabad-based political think thank. ""There is a strong consensus against a military takeover among the Pakistani people. Right now, all the public criticism is aimed at the civilian government. If the military takes over, the criticism will be directed at the military and that's something they don't want."" Retired army Major General Jamshed Ayaz Khan says the Pakistani people are fed up with current civilian leadership, but they don't think the army is the answer. ""They don't want to go back to an old system that has never worked,"" he says. 2. A vibrant Pakistani news media is watching . One of Pakistan's internationally less-known features is its fiery and remarkably free news media that acts as this fragile democracy's watchdog. A free press is only a decade-old concept in Pakistan but it has already emerged as a powerful player in Pakistani politics. At most hours of the day, Pakistanis can watch any one of dozens of 24-hour news networks, analyze the current political situation with reporters who hound politicians and catch up with newscasts that feature screaming debates and gaudy visual effects designed to make viewers stop and watch. It's not all positive news: Six journalists were killed in 2006, according to the Pakistan Press Foundation. Meanwhile the activist group Reporters Without Borders calls Pakistan one of the most dangerous places for journalists, with news personnel often being intimidated in the course of their work. Still, analysts say, the army will be answerable to the media in case of a coup. ""The media is a big factor,"" says Mehboob. ""We have already seen how the media is strongly questioning some of the actions taken by the military. If the military stages a coup there will be far more criticism from the media than any time in the past."" 3. An independent judiciary is watching . In previous coups, Pakistan's military leaders have managed to strong-arm Pakistan's judiciary into supporting army takeovers. Analysts say Pakistan's current judiciary -- led by a chief justice who was suspended in 2007 by Musharraf but later reinstated -- won't back down from a confrontation with the army. ""The Supreme Court used to lend legitimacy to such efforts by the military, but that's no longer available to the army,"" Mehboob tells CNN. 4. Pakistan's allies won't support a coup . Foreign powers, like the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, hold considerable influence over Pakistan because of economic, political and military support. That's in spite of high tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan in recent months, following the American raid into Pakistan in May 2011 that killed Osama bin laden. Still, analysts say, Pakistan's allies would view a military coup as destabilizing to the region and threatening to the fragile peace process in Afghanistan. ""The U.S. is watching and they don't want a military takeover in Pakistan,"" says Khan. ""I think they'll step in to do all they can to convince the army a coup is not the answer."" 5. The army has better options than a coup . Much of the speculation about a possible coup stems from the perception that the army's leadership doesn't like Pakistani President Azif Ali Zardari and wants him out. Tensions between Zardari and the army escalated after the Memogate scandal -- an allegation that the government sent a secret memo to Washington calling for help to curb the military's power, an accusation the government denies. Analysts say that if the army wants Zardari out, then there are safer and more practical options than a coup. The Supreme Court is investigating Memogate and pushing for the government to pursue old corruption charges against Zardari. A ruling against the president would leave him too isolated to hold on to power, analysts say. Another option would be for the army to behave like the armed forces of a democracy by waiting for next year's elections and letting the Pakistani people decide Zardari's fate with their votes.","Pakistan founded as democracy in 1947, but the military has intervened during crisis .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Whether I was squeezing myself into a crowded subway car or admiring the fall leaves around at Tsaritsino Park, I was constantly learning new Russian words during my two-week study trip to Moscow last October. When I came back, I had vague notions of continuing my linguistic education through classes and books. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any convenient classes, and the textbooks didn't hold my attention for long. I had basically given up when, about two months ago, I came upon the opportunity to use a program called Rosetta Stone. Having refreshed my vocabulary with it, I then turned to the Internet to see what other resources were available to help me stay on top of my language learning. Here's what I've found: . Free online learning . With the boom in social media, it makes sense that learning a language online would take on a Facebook-like component. My general impression is that these are great ways to exchange languages with people all over the world, but you might not always get helpful feedback. With Livemocha, you get to learn the language of your choice while helping others who want to speak your native tongue. Once you complete a structured lesson, you submit your own writing and audio recordings to other users for feedback. Reading a sentence aloud and then sending my recording off was pretty intimidating, but I got a response within 10 minutes from a girl in Russia who gave it five stars and a ""Good!!"" -- although she was surely too kind. I also got to review English submissions from other users, which felt especially gratifying because I had just been in their uncomfortable situation of sending off my words to strangers. There's also Lang-8, which is all about the practice of writing. You essentially keep a journal in the language you are practicing, and others in the online community read and correct it. Want more structure? The Computer Assisted Language Instruction Consortium gives out awards every year for outstanding language-learning Web sites: read the full list. No Russian sites made it there, but for Spanish (my second language) they cite a wonderful (and free) interactive refresher called Spanish Language and Culture with Barbara Kuczun Nelson. This site uses popular Spanish songs, photo essays and other activities to teach grammar and vocabulary. It's intended for people who have had some exposure to the language, however. iPhone apps . If you've got an iPhone, you've got a way to get exposure to your language of choice wherever there's adequate reception. In general, I'm kind of in awe of the idea that I can have a pre-recorded voice pronounce words as many times as I want so I can match it (although standing in the subway and repeating the same foreign word over and over might draw some unwanted attention). First, I checked out AccelaStudy, an iPhone app that offers practice in 15 languages, including Russian. The free version shows and pronounces 132 words in ""study"" mode. In ""flashcard"" mode, you get a word in English and then touch the screen to ""turn over"" the card and hear and see the Russian translation. I like that you can listen to each word as many times as you want before you think you're pronouncing it right. The quiz, though, is only 10 words, which are the same in the audio version and don't seem to vary. However, $7.99 will get you access to more than 2,100 unique words. This seems like a good supplement for language learning but not ideal on its own, especially since there's no speaking or writing practice. For some, Byki, also available in multiple languages, may be more useful. For $7.99, you get flash cards with audio and pictures, and I feel that both elements are essential for my own learning of new words. The app comes with 1,000 words, which is less than half that of AccelaStudy, however. I am intrigued that you can use this app to see how your vocabulary words are being used in real time on Twitter. For those without an iPhone, you can get free version of Byki for Mac or PC, or a ""deluxe"" version you can use to import vocabulary lists to the iPhone. Paying more for immersion . The gold standard of computer-based language learning seems to be Rosetta Stone. Here's what I love: It forces you, like a real situation in a foreign country, to stretch the limits of your understanding but gives you feedback so that you learn and progress. Instead of memorizing words, you confront pictures and learn to describe what's going on. In the two months since I started the beginning Russian levels, I've been exposed to a variety of everyday vocabulary words through pictures and constant audio reinforcement. It is gratifying at the end of each unit to have a ""milestone"" activity in which you interact with the people in pictures, simulating the frustration you feel when you forget how to say something basic off-the-cuff in a new language. The obvious downside for this program is the cost: $229 for Russian Level 1, for instance. Some people, such as myself, are able to get Rosetta Stone through corporate programs or universities. The other downer, depending on what your needs are, is that there is no explicit explanation for why the grammar is used the way it is. In other words, I have no idea what the different ""cases"" are in Russian, even though I understand that endings of words change in different constructions. On the other hand, small children who grow up fluent in English don't learn that in English the phrase ""if I had known"" is in the ""pluperfect subjective tense""; they just learn to say ""if I had known."" A rival to Rosetta Stone is Transparent Language, which is less expensive ($179 for the complete edition) and owns the Byki products mentioned above. But Mac users beware: It's only for PC. Use it or lose it? All of these resources have shown me that, although I let many months lapse before trying to resume my Russian, I haven't lost it all. In fact, Grant Goodall, linguistics professor at the University of California, San Diego, says that if you spent a significant amount of time interacting in a language at some point -- even a decade ago or more -- a lot of it may return. ""It seems to be that the higher your ability level that you attained to begin with, the more likely it is to come back later in life,"" he said. He also noted that, although your ability to learn a new language goes down with age, it never goes away completely. A 20-year-old will learn faster than a 40-year-old, who will learn quicker than a 60-year-old, but anyone at any age has the ability to take on a new tongue. I believe these digital resources are worthwhile tools for improving your language skills. Of course, nothing replaces the learning, and the joy, that comes with negotiating daily life in a different language in a foreign place.","Web sites such as LiveMocha have language exchange among site users .

"(CNN) -- The four acoustic pings at the center of the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 for the past seven weeks are no longer believed to have come from the plane's black boxes, a U.S. Navy official told CNN. The acknowledgment came Wednesday as searchers wrapped up the first phase of their effort, having scanned 329 square miles of southern Indian Ocean floor without finding any wreckage from the Boeing 777-200. Authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders but instead came from some other man-made source unrelated to the jetliner that disappeared on March 8, according to Michael Dean, the Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering. If the pings had come from the recorders, searchers would have found them, he said. Dean said ""yes"" when asked if other countries involved in the search had reached the same conclusions. Underwater search for MH370 postponed for at least 2 months . ""Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator,"" Dean said. The pinger locator was used by searchers to listen for underwater signals. ""Always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out, that you could start producing sound,"" Dean explained. He said it is not possible to absolutely exclude that the pings came from the black boxes, but there is no evidence now to suggest they did. However, a U.S. Navy spokesman called Dean's statement to CNN ""speculative and premature."" ""I am not saying that what Michael Dean said was inaccurate,"" the spokesman said, ""but what we are saying is that it is not his place to say it."" The Navy is continuing ""to work with our partners to more thoroughly understand the data acquired by the Towed Pinger Locater,"" according to the spokesman. ""As such, we would defer to the Australians, as the lead in the search effort, to make additional information known at the appropriate time,"" the spokesman said. Here's what we do and don't know about new MH370 data . Key role in search . The pings have played a key role in shaping the search for the plane, which disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard. The man leading the hunt said earlier this month the effort was the most difficult in human history, but technology greatly increased the chances of success. Search officials expressed ""cautious optimism"" in the pings when they were discovered April 5 and 8. Angus Houston, the man leading the hunt for the missing plane, said as recently as this month that the pulse signals remained ""the most promising lead"" in the search. The optimism stemmed from the fact the pings were detected near an arc where an Inmarsat satellite had last communicated with the plane. And it was bolstered by the pinger's steady one-ping-a-second cadence, matching that of equipment known to be on the plane. But caution stemmed from the ping's 33.3 kHz frequency, slightly lower than 37.5 kHz design frequency. There were also concerns because the four ping detection sites were miles apart. But experts said crash damage or deep ocean pressures could alter the pinger frequency. And they said the plane's two black boxes could have been separated during an explosion or crash. And they noted sounds can travel far, and even echo, in underwater environments. Dean said Wednesday officials were also concerned because, after twice detecting pings on April 5, searchers had difficulty reacquiring the pings the next day. One incident -- the loss of the pinger signal on April 8 -- had the peculiar impact of both lowering and raising expectations. The signal loss made it harder to zero-in on the black boxes. But it also boosted confidence that they had found the pingers, since the batteries were expected to die at about that time. First phase complete . On Wednesday, Australia ended the first phase of the underwater search, having finished scanning large areas around all four ping sites. The Bluefin-21 was not able to look at one area in the northernmost ping area because of the depth of the water there, Dean said. With no tangible evidence found by the underwater drone, which costs an estimated $40,000 a day to operate, search officials are regrouping and preparing to deploy more high-tech equipment. Australia said this week it will negotiate with private companies to conduct the next phase, which will resume in two months, if not later. That phase, which aims to scour about 23,166 square miles (60,000 square kilometers), probably won't start for at least two months. The cost? About $60 million. What happens next in the search? CNN's David Molko and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Navy spokesman says Michael Dean's comments on pings are ""premature""

"(CNN) -- When Sada Mire fled war-torn Somalia as a frightened teenager, the nation was descending into darkness, mired in the grip of a long civil conflict. But several years later, when she returned to the Horn of Africa as an ambitious archaeologist, her fierce determination and meticulous fieldwork brought to light the region's rich cultural heritage. In 2007, her archaeological pursuits resulted in the discovery of 5,000-year-old rock art in Somaliland, a breakaway state in the northwest corner of Somalia. The prehistoric findings, which include renderings of animals as well as human figures, are significant in enhancing understanding about the prehistoric way of life across the region, says Mire. Somaliland's first archaeologist, Mire is now on a mission to preserve and protect what she says is a heritage at risk of disappearing. Ancient findings like the rock paintings, which were discovered at Dhambalin, in a sandstone shelter near the Red Sea, not only have historic importance, but also help restore a sense of self-esteem and cultural pride in the people of Somaliland, she says. Many were completely unaware of the existence and significance of archaeology before the discovery of the cave paintings. ""I would bring them to the site and explain how important the site is potentially for helping them,"" Mire says. ""Initially it was very difficult to communicate that but after a while I managed to get their attention -- they even ended up sort of feeling a sense of dignity that actually 'this is our site' -- a feeling that 'we have nothing but we have this.' Somaliland declared independence in 1991, but isn't internationally recognized as a separate state. Mire spent her early years in Somalia's capital Mogadishu, along with her identical twin sister Sohur. There, the two sisters enjoyed a normal childhood until a bloody conflict erupted in 1982. Their mother decided that their future would not be in Somalia and started to plan an escape to Sweden. When the two sisters arrived in the Scandinavian country, they encountered a completely different reality to the one they were used to before. ""I remember the first feeling was like a glass of milk in a fridge -- sort of thinking why is it so cold? But I think we got used to it,"" Mire recalls. ""The fact that it was totally, completely different to what we had experienced was in a way healing itself, because now you had nothing to associate with what we had been through -- you could sort of reinvent yourself in a new world,"" she says. Determined to make the most of their new opportunities, Mire and her sister settled for a few years in Sweden before relocating to the United Kingdom to pursue their studies. Mire's professional journey brought her back to Somaliland a few years ago, where she embarked on a mission to unearth its cultural heritage. But while discovering significant archaeological findings, she also saw first-hand the tough conditions people lived in. ""There was no access to clean water, there was no access to basic education especially in the rural areas where the archaeology was,"" she says. ""So for me, finding an extraordinary archaeological site I had to think how is this going to help these people and not just me as a researcher."" Stemming from that sense of social responsibility, Mire helped set up and now heads Somaliland's Department of Antiquities, a branch of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Dividing her time between Somaliland and the UK, she is determined to educate her fellow Somalis about their history as well as raise awareness across the world about Somali cultural heritage. ""I feel very committed,"" she says. ""My hope for this is to be able to set up an institution which can help produce students -- Somali archaeologists, Somali cultural heritage managers.""","Sada Mire is on a mission to raise awareness about Somali cultural heritage .

"(CNN) -- The United States warned Saturday that China's military claim to airspace over a disputed island chain creates the risk of ""misunderstanding and miscalculation."" The creation of an ""Air Defense Identification Zone"" by China, which its top defense official described as an early-warning system, comes amid rising tensions between China and Japan over claims to the islands that are believed to have large oil reserves. ""This unilateral action constitutes an attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea. Escalatory action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. ""...We have urged China to exercise caution and restraint, and we are consulting with Japan and other affected parties throughout the region."" The dispute over the islands -- known as the Senkaku Islands by Japan and the Diaoyu by China -- has strained relations between the two countries. The islands are close to strategically important shipping lanes and their legal owners would also have the right to the rich marine life in surrounding waters. Even as China's Ministry of National Defense said the new air defense zone was not directed toward a specific country, it released a map and coordinates that shows the zone covers most of East China Sea, as well as the islands. ""This is a necessary measure taken by China in exercising its self-defense right,"" Col. Yang Yujun said in remarks posted on the ministry website. ""It is not directed against any specific country or target. It does not affect the freedom of over-flight in the related airspace."" The Chinese defense ministry also said it began patrols of the zone on Saturday. Japan's defense ministry said two Chinese planes came within miles of its airspace, prompting authorities to scramble Japanese fighter jets. It's the second time this month that Japan has launched fighter jets, alleging Chinese planes appeared to be closing in on its air space. U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called the move by China an attempt to destabilize the status quo in the region, and it ""increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations."" ""This announcement by the People's Republic of China will not in any way change how the United States conducts military operations in the region,"" Hagel said. The disagreement over who owns the islands flared between the two countries in the latter half of 2012. Protests erupted in China after Japan announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private Japanese owners. The deal was struck in part to prevent the islands from being bought by Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara, who had called for donations for a public fund to buy them. China was outraged, as were protesters who marched through several Chinese cities calling for boycotts of Japanese products and urging the government to give the islands back. In December 2012, the dispute escalated when Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Chinese plane was seen near the islands. A number of Chinese ships also have entered contested waters despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard. China says its claim extends back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a breakaway province, also lays claim to the islands. CNN's Barbara Starr and Tom Dunlavey contributed to this report.","China releases a map and coordinates that identify its ""Air Defense Identification Zone""

"Madrid (CNN) -- The conveyer belt of a baggage carousel that killed a 5-month-old at an airport in Spain was not moving when his mother set him on it, a Spanish Civil Guard spokesman in Madrid said Friday. But soon afterward it started moving, and the child was carried to the end, where his head was injured by the carousel's rollers, said the Civil Guard spokesman, who by custom is not identified. The infant's mother, an American, arrived at the Alicante airport late Wednesday on a flight from London's Gatwick airport with her baby boy and another young child, said a spokeswoman for Spain's airport authority, AENA. The father, who is Canadian, was already there waiting at the Alicante airport, she added. An unidentified security guard at the airport told CNN affiliate Atlas she didn't see the incident, but was told that ""the mother apparently put (the baby) down on the conveyer belt when she went to reach for something. He was crushed by the conveyer belt and it killed him."" With the baby bleeding, officials summoned airport medical personnel, who rushed to the scene but were unable to revive the infant, the Civil Guard spokesman said. The carousel for oversized luggage is a flat, black rubber-type belt that moves in only one direction, ending with a series of horizontal rollers that slow the luggage to a stop, for pickup. It's several feet long and passengers can stand on either side of it or at the receiving end, said the airport spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. The Civil Guard spokesman said the baby's weight activated the motionless conveyor belt and started it moving, but the airport spokeswoman, citing a baggage worker, said Friday that the belt is not activated by weight. A day earlier, the spokeswoman said the conveyor belt is activated only when oversized bags are sent out on it for pickup. ""I don't know what happened,"" the airport spokeswoman said. ""The Civil Guard will determine that after the investigation."" After the baby was pronounced dead, the family had to wait for a judge to arrive, by Spanish law, so that the body could be moved. Civil Guards took statements from the parents at the airport, the airport spokeswoman said. The Civil Guard says it is treating the incident as an accident. The baggage belt for oversized luggage -- which includes infant car seats and baby strollers -- is at one end of a large baggage claims hall at the Alicante airport, which handles 9 million passengers a year, the spokeswoman said. The baggage carousel is in a secure area, and passengers go through it to claim their bags before they exit into the public arrivals hall. The father of the baby would not have had access to that area, the airport spokeswoman said. Civil Guard and National Police spokesmen in Alicante confirmed the nationalities of the mother and father as American and Canadian, respectively. Spanish newspaper El Pais reported the family had come to the Alicante area, on Spain's Mediterranean coast, for vacation, but authorities would not immediately confirm that.","The conveyer belt did not start moving until after the mother placed her baby on it .

"(InStyle) -- The word itself -- housewife -- still seems almost shockingly retro. But it's having something of a renaissance, thanks in no small part to Bravo's now ubiquitous ""Real Housewives"" series. So the time seems right to salute the small screen's most fashionable female homemakers -- read on to see who made InStyle's top 10! Donna Stone, ""The Donna Reed Show"" From 1958-1966, Donna Reed played the kind of coolly capable stay-at-home mother who's really only seen on television: Always impeccably turned out -- the woman did housework in full-skirted shirtdresses and chic high heels -- she embodied a particular upper-middle-class ideal like no character before or since. See all 12 of the most stylish TV housewives of all time . Laura Petrie, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" Just 24 when she was cast in this 1961-1966 comedy, Mary Tyler Moore put a youthful spin on her traditional role ... and did her part to modernize the typical TV housewife's wardrobe, as well. ""I had Laura wear pants,"" she has explained of her famous cigarette-style slacks, ""because I said, 'Women don't wear full-skirted dressed to vacuum in.'"" Lisa Douglas, ""Green Acres"" Gorgeous, glamorous Eva Gabor played to type in this goofy 1965-1971 series, starring as a New York City (by way of Hungary) socialite forced to swap her palatial Park Avenue pad for a run-down old farmhouse. Even after relocating to rural Hooterville, though, she dressed the part of an uptown girl, donning pretty peignoirs and chic dresses to collect fresh-laid eggs and coax milk from cows. InStyle.com: The top 10 blondes in Hollywood . Marge Simpson, ""The Simpsons"" Certainly she's got style. Since 1989, Marge Simpson (voiced by actress Julie Kavner) has consistently rocked a signature look: her strapless green dress, paired with low-cut red kitten heels and a red beaded necklace, is timeless, and her bright blue beehive is almost literally inimitable, making Mrs. Homer one-of-a-kind. Vivian Banks, ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" Two different actresses played ""Aunt Viv"" during this show's 1990-1996 run, and both had their supporters. But Janet Hubert-Whitten (1990-1993) and Daphne Maxwell Reid (pictured above, 1993-1996) shared a wardrobe as restrainedly chic as you'd expect from a hip professor turned Bel-Air mom. InStyle.com: 100 Best Dresses of the Decade . Charlotte York Goldenblatt, ""Sex and the City"" As the always-impeccable Charlotte -- who retired early from her gallery job after marrying Trey (Kyle MacLachlan) and then found lasting love and domesticity with Harry (Evan Handler) -- Kristen Davis wore classic Upper East Side favorites like Oscar de la Renta. Her look was slightly more adventurous in the 2008 and 2010 films than it was in the series' initial 1998-2004 run (she donned vintage Halston and YSL during the girls' trip to Abu Dhabi) but she'll always be remembered for her mastery of the three Ps: Prim, Pretty, and Proper. Gabrielle Solis, ""Desperate Housewives"" In this show's seven seasons, Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) has been through a lot -- three marriages to two different men, several affairs, and two babies (one of which she later learned was switched at birth). Despite the drama -- and having rebounded from a period during which she was forced to sell her designer clothes to keep the family afloat -- she's still perfectly capable of looking (and dressing) like the fashion model she used to be. InStyle.com: Eva Longoria's transformation . Betty Draper, ""Mad Men"" January Jones, the actress who has played Betty Draper (now Francis) since 2007, has said that putting on her character's early 1960's garments is a key part of her process. ""I get into the girdle, the bra with the pointy cups, the stockings, the heels, the big dress ... and I'm halfway there."" Ironically, the show's retro full-skirted ensembles have had a profound effect on current fashion, which is perhaps part of the reason January has said she hopes the action doesn't continue into the 1980's. ""I don't want to see Betty in Spandex."" Gloria Delgado-Pritchett, ""Modern Family"" ""Latin women are very comfortable with their bodies and their sexuality. We aren't afraid to show that off a little bit more,"" actress Sofia Vergara has said. If so, her character on this current series seems to share that outlook. Gloria, a stay-at-home mom, wouldn't be caught dead in frumpy sweats or mom jeans; instead, she chooses slim pencil skirts and a series of colorful, cleavage-baring tops. InStyle.com: The top 10 brunets in Hollywood . Kyle Richards, ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" She's a little less flashy than her castmates (several of whom seem to have been lifted from the pages of a Judith Krantz novel). Instead, former actress Kyle prefers to keep it semi-real, although she still likes a little glitter. ""I love the sparkles that are very much in style right now,"" she has said. ""I tone it down with black pants and boots. I like to wear things that are feminine and sexy, but not too trendy.""

"(CNN) -- After what may have felt like an endless wait, Pink Floyd will deliver a new album this fall. The record, called ""The Endless River,"" will be the British band's first new release in 20 years. Fans were tipped off to its arrival on Saturday when Polly Samson, the wife of singer/guitarist David Gilmour, shared the news on Twitter. ""Btw Pink Floyd album out in October,"" Samson tweeted.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- As searches for survivors continued Saturday, police in Japan said more than 7,100 people had died since the monster earthquake and ensuing tsunami struck. On Saturday morning 7,197 people were confirmed dead, according to Japan's National Police Agency. Another 10,905 people were missing and 2,611 were injured, the agency said. Prime Minister Naoto Kan sought to reassure the nation, saying Friday that he is committed to taking firm control of a ""grave"" situation. Kan said the disaster has been a ""great test for all of the people of Japan,"" but he was confident of the resolve of his people. Amid a raised crisis level at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant from a 4 to 5 -- putting it on par with the 1979 incident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island -- Kan told his compatriots to bury their pessimism. ""With a tsunami and earthquake we don't have any room to be pessimistic,"" he said. ""We are going to create Japan again from scratch. We should face this challenge together."" Kan acknowledged the situation at the Fukushima plant remains ""very grave"" and said his government has disclosed all that it knows to both the Japanese people and the international community. ""The police, fire department and self defense forces are all working together, putting their lives on the line, in an attempt to resolve the situation,"" he said. Search teams continued Friday to comb through the rubble and residents of decimated towns sifted through twisted metal and broken wood beams, looking for remnants of the lives they lost. Rescuers planted red flags where they found dead bodies. ""I have no words to express my feelings. I lost my mind. We will have to start from zero,"" Hidemitsu Ichikawa said, taking a break from shoveling mud outside his home. In Miyagi Prefecture, officials observed a moment of silence Friday to mark the one-week anniversary of the quake. Schools have become impromptu morgues, with names of the dead posted on the doors, NHK reported. Long lines snaked around supermarkets as survivors stocked up on supplies. In the hardest-hit parts of the country, thousands of people, many of them frail and elderly, settled into shelters not knowing when they might be able to leave. Japanese media have reported difficult living conditions, including kerosene shortages that make it hard to heat the shelters. Some 380,000 people are staying at 2,200 facilities, Kyodo News reported. ""With all possible measures I'm determined, as part of the government, to improve their living conditions as much as possible,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Friday. NHK reported that 25 of the nearly 10,000 evacuees from Fukushima Prefecture have died in shelters. Twenty of them were elderly people forced to evacuate from nursing homes and a hospital after problems at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Several died as they rode without adequate medical care on a bus on the way to the high school shelter, Fukushima Prefecture government officials said. Volunteers tried to care for hundreds of patients in the school's unheated athletic building. They sent out radio messages asking people to bring in any fuel they could spare, Koyo High School Principal Masaaki Tashiro said, choking up as he recounted the struggle. ""It was so far beyond anything we had ever experienced that we were doing our very best, just trying to cope with what was in front of us, he said. ""People are exhausted from the earthquake, tsunami, and now the fear of radiation,"" he said. Japan's nuclear safety agency described the situation at the earthquake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant Friday as a ""Level 5"" incident, a rating based on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, with 1 being least and 7 being most severe. A level 5 indicates the likelihood of a release of radioactive material, several deaths from radiation and severe damage to a reactor core. Workers resumed efforts to douse a spent fuel pond outside a nuclear reactor at the Daiichi plant Friday, with its owner saying that earlier attempts had been ""somewhat effective"" in addressing radiation concerns. Conditions at the plant itself remain dangerous. Radiation levels Thursday hit 20 millisieverts per hour at an annex building where workers have been trying to re-establish electrical power, ""the highest registered (at that building) so far,"" a Tokyo Electric official told reporters. By comparison, the typical resident of a developed country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts per year. The top priority for officials is the nuclear facility's No. 3 reactor -- the sole damaged unit that contains plutonium along with the uranium in its fuel rods, Edano said. Significant amounts of radiation have been released since the earthquake hit on March 11, followed by a tsunami that swept away diesel generators needed to keep water pumping over the fuel rods. The disasters spurred several hydrogen explosions at the nuclear plant. But Japanese officials have tried to allay fears of an imminent meltdown. A meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods cannot be cooled and the nuclear core melts. In the worst-case scenario, the fuel can rupture the containment unit spilling out radioactivity through the air and water. That, public health officials say, can cause both immediate and long-term health problems, including radiation poisoning and cancer. The government has ordered the evacuation of about 200,000 people living in a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) area around the plant, and told people living between 20 kilometers and 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the plant to remain indoors. ""Evacuees, and that can be said of myself as well, are feeling anxious since we are not getting the needed information from the government in a timely manner,"" said Seiji Sato, a spokesman for the government of Tamura City, about 20 kilometers from the nuclear facility. One group of 21 people evacuated from a town near the plant made it to a shelter in Shinjo-shi, 300 kilometers (186 miles) away. They told officials there that they drove as far away as possible, until they ran out of gas. CNN's Kyung Lah, Gary Tuchman, Brian Todd and Brian Walker contributed to this report.","Naoto Kan says he is confident Japan will overcome the tragedy .

""Also, there is a lot of family support and understanding, and we're all determined to rally behind him and help him become the man he's capable of being. We're grateful to the Sheriff's department for their intervention, and believe Indio can be another recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale."" The elder Downey had several well-publicized issues with drug addiction in the 1990s. He went through treatment a number of times, including a year in the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, before finally getting clean in 2001.

"(CNN) -- Gifts have been arriving at the Steffel home in Kalida, Ohio, every day. Blankets, photographs, paintings. It started with a simple request that grieving father Nathen Steffel posted to Reddit on Sunday: . ""My daughter recently passed away after a long battle in the children's hospital. She was in the hospital her whole life and we were never able to get a photo without all her tubes. Can someone remove the tubes?"" The image of their daughter, Sophia, connected to breathing tubes is the Steffels' favorite because it captured her during one of few times she was awake. In the photo her eyes are wide open and she appears to be staring into the camera. Nathen Steffel said he's been a member of the Reddit online community for a while and had seen many instances of talented Photoshop work. He was hoping to get at least one good image. So far, he's received more than 100 photos, drawings and paintings. ""We're still getting them today. From all over the world,"" he said in a phone interview Wednesday. ""I can't even read what some of them say."" Initially he responded to each message but eventually it became overwhelming. The responses helped take their minds off things even though most of them were condolences. Nathen Steffel is now in touch with a parent who went through a similar experience. The couple first learned there was a mass on their baby's liver during a routine ultrasound. ""They didn't know what it was,"" Emily Steffel said. ""They just said they'd keep an eye on it."" They shared the news with family and friends, and when Sophia Steffel was born May 30 tests revealed a liver tumor known as hepatic hemangioma. The condition is a rare noncancerous tumor linked to high rates of heart failure and death in infants, according to the National Institutes of Health. Sophia was transferred from one children's hospital to another and died on July 10. She was 6 weeks old. ""Everyone did everything they could,"" Nathen Steffel said. The Steffels' story has drawn widespread attention and media coverage, which the couple says will help them explain Sophia's story to her brothers Tristan, 5, and Owen, 3. Nathen Steffel's sister told him she's comforted by all the attention -- happy that Sophia's story didn't just end at the hospital. ""We'll have this memory forever,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A dark car parks in front of a residence in Tripoli, Libya. Immediately, a white van stops next to it. Men leap from the van and point guns at the car. They yank open the car doors, pull a man out and shove him into the van. The van speeds away. In less than 30 seconds, the United States had taken suspected al Qaeda member Anas al-Libi into custody. Dramatic security camera video published Monday in the Washington Post shows U.S. commandos capturing al-Libi last October. Al-Libi is a top terror suspect. He's accused of playing a key role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people and wounded about 5,000. The video was shot from a vantage point above al-Libi's family home in Tripoli. The family tells CNN's Jomana Karadsheh the video is genuine and was recorded on the family's home security system. The capture was executed with lightning speed. Digital time on the video shows only half a minute passing between when al-Libi's car stops and the departure of the white van. As the commandos leave, al-Libi's car rolls forward and out of frame, apparently because he didn't have time to put it in park. Later images show members of the family reacting, running downstairs to the street. The video was provided only to al-Libi's U.S. lawyers, the family said. Karadsheh and CNN's Nic Robertson, who both visited the location, said the video is consistent with the street outside the family home. Al-Libi, 49, is now being held in New York. He was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York on charges of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, murder, destruction of American buildings and government property and destruction of national defense utilities of the United States. His wife said he was no longer a member of al Qaeda, had been living a normal life and was seeking a job with the Libyan oil ministry. On October 5, the day of the capture, a team of U.S. Navy SEALs in southern Somalia targeted the top leader of Al-Shabaab, which was behind the mall attack in Kenya in September. The SEALs came under fire and had to withdraw before they could confirm whether they killed their target, a senior U.S. official said.

"(CNN) -- Actor Jonah Hill told radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday that he lost his cool with a paparazzo and is heartbroken that he used a ""disgusting"" homophobic slur. Celebrity gossip site TMZ early Tuesday morning released a video of the incident in which Hill tells a man following him to ""Suck my d---, you f-----."" The actor, who was nominated for Academy Awards for his roles in the 2011 film ""Moneyball"" and last year's ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" told Stern he never meant to insult gay people. ""I played into exactly what he wanted and lost my cool and in that moment I said a disgusting word that does not at all reflect how I feel about any group of people,"" he told Stern. TMZ posted a one-minute clip shot by a photographer who at one point mocks Hill's shorts. Hill said the photographer had been following him all day and saying ""hurtful things about my family.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. ""Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,"" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey . When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. Come December, Orion will be wheeled onto the Cape Canaveral launch pad and the countdown will begin. If all goes as planned, the engines will rumble and its rocket will thunder in an explosion of liquid oxygen, thrusting it toward the stars. The rocket will carry the modules 3,600 miles above Earth, or about 16 times higher than the average altitude of the International Space Station. Orion ""is built to take humans farther than they've ever gone before,"" NASA says. Orion will orbit our planet twice on its own during a 4Â½-hour journey before screaming back into the Earth's atmosphere at nearly 20,000 miles per hour and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. Future missions . Orion astronauts will enjoy access to unprecedented space travel technology. NASA says the spacecraft's onboard computer system can process 480 million instructions per second, which is 400 times faster than the systems on the space shuttle and 4,000 times faster than those on the Apollo flights of the 1960s and early 1970s. Orion also boasts the largest heat shield ever built, designed to withstand temperatures that would cause a nuclear reactor to melt down. ""Orion's flight test will provide us with important data that will help us test out systems and further refine the design so we can safely send humans far into the solar system to uncover new scientific discoveries on future missions,"" Geyer said. After Orion splashes down, NASA will begin preparing the spacecraft for the future manned missions for which it was designed. ""In the future, Orion will launch on NASA's new heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System,"" the agency said. ""More powerful than any rocket ever built, SLS will be capable of sending humans to deep space destinations such as an asteroid and eventually Mars."" The first astronauts will travel into space aboard Orion in 2017. NASA hopes its Exploration Mission-1, a 25-day flight around the moon's dark side, will demonstrate Orion's reliability for deep space missions. Exploration Mission-1 will send four astronauts farther than any human has been since the last Apollo moon mission in 1972, laying the groundwork for future endeavors. NASA hopes Orion will ring in a new era for crewed American space exploration, and American flags may someday fly on more space outposts than just the moon.

"(CNN) -- The Upper Midwest is about to get three days of September -- in July. An unseasonal invasion of cool Canadian air could put lows in the 40s -- about 10 to 15 degrees below normal -- in parts of North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan into Wednesday. Chicago, too, will be wondering what month it is, with lows in the 50s and highs Tuesday and Wednesday in the low 70s. The reason: Last week's Typhoon Neoguri created some ripples in the jet stream, causing it to dip farther south than it normally does this time of year. ""It's not weird to get a dip in the jet stream, but it is weird to get it in July, dipping this far south,"" CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said. ""So we are getting those cooler than normal temperatures across the Great Lakes region."" Some examples: . â€¢ Duluth, Minnesota, will see lows in the upper 40s Tuesday and Wednesday, with highs in the upper 60s and low 70s. Monday's expected high, 59, is well below the July normal of 75. â€¢ Marquette, Michigan, also will see lows in the upper 40s Tuesday and Wednesday, with highs in the low 60s Monday and Tuesday. The average high for this time of year is 77. â€¢ Grand Forks, North Dakota, will see lows in the upper 40s or lower 50s Tuesday and Wednesday. Monday's high will be around 67 -- a departure from the July normal in the low 80s. Meanwhile, the East will be getting drenched. Three inches of rain are possible in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast from Monday to Wednesday. Storms on Monday could be severe in parts of the country, including much of the East Coast from Virginia to the north, as well as Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. Damaging wind and heavy rain are possible. By Tuesday, the strongest storms should be confined to the Mid-Atlantic, and they'll be mostly along the coast Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- In the beginning, one might have considered it bold -- even inventive -- to oppose every single thing President Obama supported. But it quickly became tiresome and predictable over the last five years. And now, as House Republicans weigh a resolution to sue President Obama for not quickly enough implementing a law the same Republicans voted more than 50 times to repeal or stall, all hell has broken loose. Republicans are just being obnoxious now. And dangerous. And nuts. On Wednesday, the House Rules Committee will debate a draft resolution to file a lawsuit against President Obama, wasting taxpayer dollars in what is plainly a political stunt. Their complaint? That President Obama did not implement the employer mandate in Obamacare quickly enough. That's right, that same employer mandate Republicans have berated Obama for, the one in the health care reform law they've voted 54 (failed) times to try to repeal or delay or stall -- the law, incidentally, that's working -- House Republicans are now using taxpayer money to sue President Obama for not implementing it quickly enough. Yeah. Meanwhile, at least Republicans aren't going full-political-stunt and impeaching President Obama ... yet. Sarah Palin has thrown her constitutional-scholar-like support behind the idea. Though as Attorney General Eric Holder said of Palin this weekend: ""She wasn't a particularly good vice presidential candidate. She's an even worse judge of who ought to be impeached and why."" Republicans bash President Obama for issuing executive orders. But why should facts like the Constitution or how every president in history has used executive orders, and in most cases more than President Obama, stand in the way of a good partisan line of attack, let alone a political stunt? Facts and proportionality certainly haven't been a barrier for Republicans so far. For instance, also within the last week, conservative talk radio host Ben Shapiro said on Fox News that the Obama White House is a ""borderline Jew-hating administration."" Republicans had long criticized the President as anti-Israel. For instance, the Romney campaign ran a commercial criticizing Obama for not visiting Israel during the first three-and-a-half years of his presidency, and conservative pundit Mark Levin accused President Obama of ""hating Israel."" But suggesting the White House and by, er, obvious implication President Obama, hates Jews is a whole new level of accusation. It's also a whole new level of crazy neglect of basic facts. President Obama has increased security assistance to Israel every single year since taking office and Obama personally championed providing an additional $275 million over its standard foreign military financing aid in order to fund the construction of the so-called ""Iron Dome"" defense system."" But facts, schmacts. Republican smears against Obama are even more impervious than the Iron Dome. No logic or reason can pierce their facade of BS. Witness Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who last week called President Obama ""tone deaf"" for not visiting the border during his trip to Texas. Texas Gov. Rick Perry also dinged the President along these lines: ""The President needs to come to the border, to see it himself."" For his part, President Obama said, ""I'm not interested in photo ops, I'm interested in solving a problem."" Which sounds almost like Obama is quoting Cornyn and Perry ... back in 2011. Then, when pressing Congress to pass immigration reform, President Obama went to the border and ... Republicans criticized him for doing so. ""What Sen. Cornyn is looking for, President Obama cannot deliver with another speech or photo op, and that's presidential leadership. Words matter little when there is no action,"" a Cornyn spokesperson said at the time. Similarly, in 2011, Perry criticized Obama's trip to the border, ""I was very disheartened when the President came into El Paso a couple of weeks ago (and) had a photo-op."" In case you're not good at math, that's Republicans criticizing President Obama for doing something and then -- just three years later -- criticizing him for not doing the same thing. Try as you might, there's just no way to rationalize the difference. Republicans damn President Obama he does it and damned if he doesn't. But if you still believe in facts, here's something for you: Republicans crashed our nation's economy with their astronomical tax cuts, lax oversight of business and unfunded wars. But instead of facing the truth and re-examining how their policies systematically harm our nation, Republicans just attack and blame President Obama. They simply don't know what else to do. That's not so say President Obama never does anything wrong or doesn't sometimes deserve blame. Of course he does and we should have political checks and balances. But while blaming and condemning President Obama has been Republicans' sole strategy since the moment he was elected, they've taken that crazy irresponsibility to the next level -- including suing the President of the United States of America for doing his job and carefully implementing laws, even the ones Republicans hate. That's what all presidents do. Meanwhile, Congress is supposed to work with the President and pass laws. Republicans are the ones who aren't doing their jobs. They're too busy spending our money on their partisan revenge stunts and inventing new outlandish attacks against Obama to distract the American people from the giant mess the Republican Party has caused -- and not only are they not doing anything to fix it, they have no solutions. The more irrational and hypocritical the Republican attacks get, the more they're desperately trying to hide this simple truth.","Sally Kohn: House GOP try to sue President for not implementing a law they fought .

"(CNN) -- It may have taken 260 years but the home of golf is finally preparing to allow women to join its ranks. The Royal & Ancient Club of St. Andrews, which was established in 1764 and serves as golf's governing body outside of the U.S. and Mexico, has faced growing criticism for its all-male policy. A ballot will be held in September, with 2,500 members expected to ratify the proposal. The R&A says it hopes the resolution will pass with the required two-thirds majority. ""The club's committees are strongly in favor of the rule change and are asking members to support it,"" a spokesperson told CNN. Speaking to CNN in July last year, R&A chief executive Peter Dawson insisted the single-sex policy of clubs such as 2013 British Open host venue Muirfield -- and others -- was a historic hangover. He told reporters at Wednesday's announcement of the September vote: ""It's something that has been expected; I'm not going to say overdue but I'm sure I'll be asked that question. ""Early indications from the members are very positive indeed. We have been talking about this for quite a while and it's our governance role which has been the driving factor. ""Society is changing, sport is changing, golf is changing and I think it's appropriate for a governing body to take this step."" The Royal and Ancient Golf Club has traditionally been the guardian of the rules of the game since 1754, although since 2004 it devolved responsibility for the administration of the game and the British Open to the newly-formed R&A. Last year the R&A was criticized for choosing East Lothian's Muirfield, which has a male-only membership policy, to host Europe's only major -- and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond refused to attend the tournament. The move by the R&A brings it in line with Augusta National, which allowed female members to join the prestigious U.S. club for the first time in 80 years in 2012. Augusta, which hosts the Masters, faced years of protests with President Obama also adding pressure on the organization. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore became the first women to be admitted as members.","Vote to allow women to join Royal and Ancient Golf Club for first time in 250 years .

"(CNN) -- Newly released 3-D images of two mummified baby mammoths provide a window into the lives and deaths of creatures that roamed Siberia over 40,000 years ago. Details in the x-ray scans have let researchers look at things like the specimens' bone structures, causes of death, and even how healthy they were before they died. By comparing the specimens to each other, to other mammoths, and to their only living cousinsâ€”elephantsâ€”researchers have added a lot to what we know about mammoths. Computed tomography (CT) scanning uses millions of ultra-thin x-ray slices to build 3-D models of solid objects. The scans tell scientists how solid objects are put together without having to take them apart. The donut-shaped machines are relatively common in hospitals, and there are some veterinary machines that can do full-body scans of dolphins and small whales. But the size and shape of a mammoth with its limbs frozen in place, even a baby one, means it can't be safely fit into machines designed for long, thin, living things. But scientists aren't the only ones interested in scanning the insides of large objects. Outside of Detroit, the Ford Motor Company has a large, industrial CT scanner they use to look inside big, awkward objects like car transmissions and engine blocks. And when one of the mammoths was being transported in a FedEx truck from Chicago's Field Museum to the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey in 2010, scientists at the University of Michigan saw an opportunity. ""We knew the drivers had to sleep at some point in the route,"" said mammoth expert Daniel Fisher. So he and his colleagues convinced Lyuba's Russian handlers to make an overnight detour to Detroit. Read more: Get Ready to Learn a Bunch of Awesome New Science About Pluto . The things Fisher and his colleagues learned from the resulting 3-D images made big news. Lyuba was only a month old when she died, and is one of the most well-preserved mammoths ever found. The new research published today in the Journal of Paleontology compares Lyuba's scans to those of another relatively well-preserved baby mammoth, Khroma, who died several thousand years before, and several thousand miles away. Fisher's team was able to recreate, with reasonable certainty, how the two mammoths died. Combined with other research, they also used these scans to get a broader picture of how young mammoths lived. Lyuba's trunk, trachea, and lungs were filled with sediment. Fisher thinks this happened when she inhaled mud and choked to death after she fell into cold water. The scans also revealed traces on her face and in her lungs of an iron-rich mineral that usually occurs in oxygen-poor places like lake beds. Fisher thinks this means she fell and settled at the bottom of a Pleistocene lake, which has since dried up. Besides an oddly-compressed left ribcage, Lyuba's largely intact body suggests she spent most of the next 40,000 years in the tundra tucked peacefully away. Her postmortem existence became more turbulent after she was discovered by reindeer hunters in 2007. According to Fisher, their leader recognized Lyuba's importance and trekked many miles in the snow to alert the authorities. In the meantime, a less-civic-minded relative sold Lyuba to a local shop that put her on display for tourists. The Russian authorities found her, but not before dogs had chewed off her ear and tail. Science has treated her more respectfully, but she's still been thawed, refrozen, chemically preserved, sawed into, prodded, poked, shipped, and scanned since she was rescued. Khroma fared a little worse than Lyuba. Not only did she have a broken back, her body had been picked at by ravens and arctic foxes. But after surviving thousands of Siberian winters, it was the Russian bureaucracy that almost did her in. Soon after they found Khroma, Russian scientists sent samples of her tissue to a microbiology lab. ""There was somebody at this lab who claimed they found Anthrax on this baby mammoth,"" he said. The Russians decided the carcass should be incinerated immediately. Read more: 30 Years After Chernobyl's Meltdown, Gripping Photos Expose the Human Fallout . Fisher and other mammoth experts delayed the destruction by calling for an investigation. That summer at an annual conference on mammoths, the scientists tried to come up with a strategy to save Khroma. Finally, they convinced the Russians to let them destroy the bacteria by putting the mammoth inside a nuclear reactor. Still frozen (Lyuba was chemically desiccated in a manner similar to Vladimir Lenin), Fisher says Khroma spent five days at a French power plant and then went to a French hospital for partial-body scanning. Khroma never made it to a full-body CT machine, but her scans were still informative. Like Lyuba, her trunk, mouth and throat were filled with sediment, suggesting she also choked to death. From tusk samples, Fisher determined that Khroma was about two months old when she died. She had a wider head and jawbone than Lyuba, and more well-developed feet and shoulders than the younger mammoth. The researchers are unsure if Khroma actually grew that much in just a month, or if her bigger bones indicate she's from an undescribed sub-species. The two mummies set a baseline for comparing other young mammoth remains and will help researchers build a fuller picture of how they grew and were cared for, Fisher says. They can also reveal how similar mammoths were to elephants, their only living relative. For example, Khroma's skull is slightly smaller than an elephant's of the same age, which suggests mammoths developed more slowly. Mammoths also had smaller ears, fatty humps, and coats of long hair, but Fisher says they're more alike than different to their modern cousins. ""We've learned with direct, physical evidence how similar they are: how similar in family structure, life history, and very similar bodies."" Read more from WIRED: .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this month, Walt Disney World celebrated its 40th anniversary. The Magic Kingdom opened its doors to the public for the first time on October 1, 1971, and not only did the landscape of Central Florida change, the landscape of the family vacation did as well. Many non-Disneyphiles had no clue about the milestone. There wasn't a big marketing push or makeover of the iconic Cinderella Castle as there was for the 25th anniversary in 1996, a celebration that lasted more than a year. For the anniversary this year, all the ""Mouse House"" did was hold a special parade and a brief ceremony, along with a tweak to the nightly ""Wishes"" fireworks display. Guests who came to the park that day also received a commemorative pin. The lack of hype for the anniversary can be tied to a recent change made by Disney executives, says Chad Emerson, who just edited a book of essays on the Magic Kingdom's 40 years in business, titled ""Four Decades of Magic."" Disney is cutting costs by streamlining operations at its domestic parks, located in Anaheim, California, and Orlando. Several industry experts, however, are questioning Disney's newest plan of not only streamlining the behind-the-scenes aspects of its domestic parks, like human resources, but also the entire Disney experience -- down to attractions and merchandise. Brent Young, co-host of the theme park-focused podcast ""Season Pass"" and managing director for Super 78 studios, said Disney fans wanted the hoopla of a 40th anniversary bash. ""Frankly, the fans would love for them to celebrate the 40th. The fans of Walt Disney World understand the impact that Walt Disney World has made not only on the United States, as a destination park for the United States, but the world as well,"" he said. Emerson believes Disney is taking the wrong path when it comes to its latest plan. ""That synthesizing and making a generic Disney park experience for merchandise, for attractions, for food and beverage for these other guest interaction pieces has been one of the most unfortunate decisions that the parks and resorts division has ever made,"" Emerson said. Disney spokesman Rick Sylvain said marketing this year does incorporate all parks. ""Our focus during this 'Let the Memories Begin' year in Disney parks remains on our guests and the memories they have made, are making and will make in our parks,"" he said. The Central Florida parks of course remain a popular destination for families like the Hickmans, from Atlanta. Jeff and Kristi Hickman opted to take their two girls to Walt Disney World for the very first time this summer, and it was a hit. ""There's a first time for everything, and that first time was great! And I want to (go) again when I'm older, or in a couple of months because it was really ... enjoyable and I had a great time,"" said 8-year-old Hannah Hickman. That's despite the Central Florida summer heat. Hannah's mother, Kristi, said she was prepared not to have a good time and was making the sacrifice for her children. ""We were going in July. I set my mind that I know it's fun, I had a blast when I was little, but I'm an adult now and it may not be as fun. I'm going to wait in lines, it's going to be hot, I'm going to be thirsty,"" Kristi Hickman said. ""You know, it was amazing, all that didn't even bother me. It was like, you know, I was just their age again. I loved it just as much."" Jeff Hickman was focused on the finances of bringing his family to Walt Disney World, but enjoyed the trip. ""We saved up for it. We spent every penny that we saved. We're still trying to recover. But I would go again in a heartbeat. I would have to save up again ... but I think it was definitely worth it. It was a great family memory,"" he said. According to Emerson, other families might not opt to go to Walt Disney World, but would just look for a ""Disney experience"" elsewhere -- and that should have the Orlando Convention and Visitors Bureau concerned. ""If I was the Orlando CVB, I would be a little bit concerned about this strategy, because it's basically telling guests go to a Disney park, it doesn't matter which one,"" Emerson said.","Walt Disney World marks 40th anniversary with little hype .

"(CNN) -- Prominent Bahraini activist Maryam al-Khawaja was arrested after arriving in the island nation over the weekend. ""To be clear, I'm officially under arrest on unknown charges,"" al-Khawaja tweeted Saturday. ""They will bring me before a judge tomorrow at an unknown time."" She has said that she wants to visit her father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. He has been on hunger strike since August 24, according to the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. Bahraini authorities released a statement Monday citing a ""case that was presented to them from the Bahrain airport police."" Without mentioning Maryam al-Khawaja by name, the statement said the ""accused person"" had an outstanding warrant and was arrested upon arriving in Bahrain, according to Abdullah al-Dossary, district attorney for al-Muharraq province. ""At that point, while she was being searched, she was asked by the police to surrender her telephone, which she refused and assaulted a police officer and a female police officer and caused injuries as accompanied by the medical reports,"" the statement said. In the presence of her attorney, the woman was charged with assaulting a state employee while performing official duties, based on witness statements and the medical reports of the officers who were allegedly attacked, al-Dossary said. She was then sent to jail for seven days while the investigation is conducted, the statement said. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja's other daughter was also briefly detained after attempting to visit her father Thursday, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights said. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja was sentenced to life in prison in 2011 on charges related to participating in anti-government demonstrations and plotting to overthrow the Gulf nation's royal family. Maryam al-Khawaja's Twitter account, which was taken over by ""someone close to the al-Khawaja family,"" said that she will face three sets of charges: one related to a human rights campaign, one related to insulting the king and one related to assaulting police. The investigation has been extended for seven days, and al-Khawaja is not allowed to see a lawyer before her interrogation, according to her Twitter. The 27-year-old -- who holds Bahraini and Danish citizenship -- is one of the most visible figures speaking out against Bahrain's government. Bahrain, a majority Shiite nation, is ruled by a Sunni monarchy. The country experienced its own set of protests that started during the Arab Spring and have continued for the past three years. Demonstrators say authorities killed dozens of people and imprisoned hundreds of others while cracking down on dissidents. ""The thing about Bahrain is that nobody really knows what's going on there because there's not much media coverage,"" al-Khawaja said last year.

"(CNN) -- Prominent Chinese journalist and press freedom advocate Gao Yu has been detained for allegedly leaking state secrets, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported Thursday. The detention puts Gao on a growing list of dissident voices and intellectuals who are being held by police ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The 70-year-old is accused of sharing a ""highly confidential document"" with a foreign website that published the material last year. The document, issued by the Communist Party's Central Committee, was widely distributed online, according to the report. Xinhua did not specify which document was leaked and did not name the website that published it. After she was detained, Gao expressed ""deep remorse"" for her actions, according to Xinhua. She told police in Beijing she ""deeply regretted that her behavior harmed the nation's interests and violated the law, and she is willing to accept punishment from the law,"" according to the report. Chinese broadcaster CCTV televised Gao's confession on Thursday morning. Police arrested Gao on April 24 and seized evidence from her home in the Chinese capital, according to Xinhua. Other high-profile activists and scholars have been detained in recent weeks, including human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and four other people who attended a low-key event last week marking the 25th anniversary of the June 4th Tiananmen Square protests. Gao was reported missing after she failed to attend the meeting. The outspoken journalist, whose columns are published on German news outlet Deutsche Welle's Chinese-language site, began her career as a reporter for the China News Service in 1979. She was arrested after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and released more than a year later. She was imprisoned for another six years for leaking state secrets in 1993. 25 years later, Tiananmen Square no less taboo for China's censors .

"(CNN) -- Oh, oh, oh -- golf's very own version of the ""Fab Four"" are back with a bang. After racking up nearly six millions hits on YouTube with their debut music video, the Golf Boys have returned with ""2.Oh"", a rap inspired by the stars of the PGA Tour which aims to raise money for charity in Africa. U.S. golfers Ben Crane, Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan first joined forces in 2011 for ""Oh, Oh, Oh"", and the quartet have once again taken to the mic -- this time to help provide clean water for the people of Ethiopia. By Tuesday, the video had amassed nearly 700,000 views on the video-sharing website after less than 24 hours online. ""We are in a truly unique era,"" Crane told the PGA Tour's official website. ""I love that we can goof off on YouTube and help people across the world. I'm all in for that."" Four-time tournament winner Crane is already an online star in his own right. The world No. 103's YouTube channel is the second most popular of any active athlete, surpassing that of NBA superstar LeBron James, according to the PGA Tour report. ""On a personal level, social media has done a lot to change the perception of who I am,"" explained Crane, whose spoof workout video has been viewed over one million times. ""I think I've been able to show fans a different side of myself and other pro golfers. I'm a golfer, first and foremost, but spending one day every few months to create a video that raises money for charity and might grow the game is too good of an opportunity to pass up.

"(CNN) -- All the talk at Muirfield has been about which drought would be broken. Would world No. 1 Tiger Woods win his first major in five years? Could Lee Westwood complete his 18-year quest for a major title? No-one talked much about Phil Mickelson, on his own personal mission to end a British Open quest that began in 1991 at Royal Birkdale. But at the 20th time of asking, the man known as 'Lefty' produced some of the most dynamic golf of his career to electrify the galleries and finally wrap his hands round the Claret Jug. Four birdies on the final six holes saw Mickelson surge up the leaderboard, his last on the 18th green prompting tears as the enormity of his achievement sunk in. Starting the day five shots off the lead he won his fifth major at a canter, three clear of Sweden's Henrik Stenson in second, with Westwood joint third and Woods in a share of sixth. No wonder the 43-year-old told the gallery at Muirfield it was his finest ever round, a glittering career now only lacking one of the four golfing majors, the U.S. Open. ""It's an amazing feeling,"" Mickelson told a press conference. ""I hit some of the best shots I've ever hit, putted better than I've ever putted. ""I needed to show up and play some of the best golf of my career and that's what I did. It's a day I'll always cherish. ""I was behind the whole day. The putt at 13 was going to make the day go one way or another. It's very hard to make birdies here. ""I had to compose myself up to 18 because when I walking up to the green I realized this championship was in my control. That's when I started to get emotional. ""It's a special moment to be a part of the history this championship. This has been the biggest challenge of my career to capture this trophy."" Day three: Woods hunting Westwood . The clear skies and bright sunshine that graced the opening three days of the 142nd Open were absent by the time the final round began to form a decisive shape. As the majority of spectators alternated between the final two groups, Mickelson was steadily, and stealthily, winding his way through the field under a blanket of cloud on the East Lothian coast. He reached the turn at two-under, by which time the frontrunners had begun to shed shots. Slowly but surely, the galleries got wind of his charge and made a beeline for Lefty. It was the 13th where the momentum swung his way, a birdie putt sparking a run that was to end with him posing for photos with the Claret Jug as the main grandstand was enveloped in late afternoon gloom. Another birdie on 14 moved him one shot behind then leader Scott, before two perfect blows to the par five 17th saw him infused with adrenalin as he seized the outright lead for the first time in the Championship. By this time Scott had carded four consecutive bogeys, the same run that saw him relinquish the lead 12 months ago at Royal Lytham to allow South African Ernie Els to claim his second Open title. Another Mickelson birdie on the final hole saw him punching the air, hugging his caddy Jim 'Bones' Mackay and breaking down as he realized he'd finally landed the one crown he wasn't sure his game was equipped to deliver. It was his second victory in a week after he won the Scottish Open and goes some way to repairing the desolation he felt after losing out on the U.S. Open crown to England's Justin Rose at Merion last month. For home hoppe Westwood, the final day only served to reinforce the widely-held notion that his game isn't sturdy enough to close out a major championship. Leading by two as he teed off in front of a supportive crowd at 2:10pm local time, he managed just one birdie and carded five bogeys. It meant he ended a 62nd major without topping the leaderboard, extending an unwanted record that weighs heavily around his neck. ""I didn't play that badly -- probably not so well at seven, eight or nine,"" he explained to reporters. ""Phil must have played really well for five under par this afternoon, especially with a breeze going. That is a special finish in a major championship."" Woods too will rue missed opportunities as he goes in search of the 15th title that will end his half-decade without a major championship. Three birdies were canceled out by six bogeys and he could only watch from the 14th green as, only 30 yards away, Mickelson marched up the 17th on his way to a pivotal birdie to a rapturous ovation from the crowd. ""It was frustrating. I played well,"" Woods told reporters. ""I could just never get the speed right today. ""I had a hard time adjusting to the speeds. They were much slower today, much softer. I don't think I got too many putts to the hole today. ""I really had a hard time and left myself a couple of long lag putts early on when [the wind] was really blowing, and left them way short and didn't make those putts.""","American Phil Mickelson wins the British Open at Muirfield by three shots .

"(CNN)  -- A study by the Organization of American States concluded last month that many of the buildings in Haiti were so shoddily constructed that they were unlikely to survive any disaster, let alone an earthquake like the one that devastated Port-au-Prince on Tuesday, the man who supervised the report said Wednesday. ""You could tell very easily that these buildings were not going to survive even a [magnitude] 2 earthquake,"" said Cletus Springer, director of the Department of Sustainable Development at OAS in Washington. Structures were built on slopes without proper foundations or containment structures, using improper building practices, insufficient steel and insufficient attention to development control, the urban planner said. Much of the poor-quality work can be traced to the grinding poverty pervasive in Haiti, he said. ""As we know, the poverty in Haiti lends itself to people building where they want, how they can,"" he said. ""It was our experience, especially coming out of Grenada, that in the poorer countries the construction quality standards are pretty lax,"" ""Unfortunately, the earthquake yesterday has revealed that."" After Hurricane Ivan flattened much of Grenada in September 2004, the OAS carried out a similar research effort, then helped the island nation strengthen its building practices, Springer said. Within three years, artisans and engineers had been trained to strengthen that island's building-control systems and procedures, he said. Even financing was addressed. ""We worked with the banks to be sure we could properly vet applications for mortgages."" But much of the Caribbean, including Haiti, has no building codes, he said. ""So now we need to work with the Haitian authorities to develop a building code that is suited to Haiti and its peculiar conditions."" Those peculiarities include its location on a fault line and in the path of hurricanes. Springer said the country must work with the private sector and the banking sector to devise a low-income building ethic for Haiti. ""Because of the poverty levels, not everybody's going to be able to build to the exacting standards that a building code would require,"" Springer said. Tuesday's earthquake showed that even those buildings that should have been constructed to the highest standards -- hospitals, schools, the presidential palace -- collapsed, he said. ""Schools, hospitals, all government facilities should be safe so that, in the event of catastrophes like these, these buildings can withstand these things so there can be some continuity in the operations of government and the private sector,"" he said. ""Going forward, we need to help Haiti to build back better."" That means building safer homes that can withstand hurricane-force winds and earthquakes of 7 magnitude, he said. But any such effort will require a great deal of support from the international community and collaboration with universities so that they can train the next generation of engineers, construction workers and masons to help Port-au-Prince rebuild safely. The report -- funded by the OAS and more than 100 pages in length -- has not been made public, he said. ""It was not produced for external consumption,"" he said, adding that he did not know when parts of it might be released.","Organization of American States study says buildings couldn't take disaster .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm failed to report more than $1 million in sales and wages at a Manhattan restaurant he once ran, using unreported cash to pay workers ""off the books"" to ""evade taxes and keep more money for himself,"" a federal prosecutor said. Grimm, R-New York, pleaded not guilty on Monday in federal court in Brooklyn to 20 counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, filing false tax returns, hiring unauthorized aliens and perjury. A former FBI agent who used to investigate fraud, Grimm wore a dark suit and was not handcuffed during the hearing. He was released on $400,000 bond, secured by his home in Staten Island. As conditions for his release, Grimm, 44, must surrender his guns and passport. He told reporters that he would remain in office while fighting the charges. He's up for re-election in November. ""I'm going to fight tooth and nail ... until I am fully exonerated,"" Grimm said. One of his lawyers said previously that Grimm would be vindicated. Grimm stepped down from his position on the Financial Services Committee. In a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, Grimm asked to be removed from the committee until resolution of the unfolding legal matters. Boehner ""believes Rep. Grimm's decision is appropriate under the circumstances,"" the speaker's spokesman, Michael Steel, said. Indictment unsealed . An indictment unsealed on Monday after a probe of more than two years alleges Grimm lied to investigators about his taxes after leaving the Healthalicious restaurant to run for Congress. He ""never met a tax he didn't lie to evade,"" U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said. The charges relate to Grimm's operation of Healthalicious from 2007 to 2010, following his FBI tenure. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, representing Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn. He was re-elected two years later. Grimm, as an accountant, attorney, former Marine and ex-FBI agent, ""was poised for success as a small business owner,"" but ""made the choice to go from upholding the law to breaking it,"" Lynch said in a written statement. Much of the alleged scheme involved cash customers paid at the register, as opposed to credit or debit payments that created a paper record, Lynch said. The restaurant, in which Grimm had a 45% partnership interest, didn't report some of the cash as income, Lynch's office said. The restaurant also used cash to pay some workers -- some of whom didn't have legal status -- and then didn't report the payments to tax authorities, Lynch's office said. ""Many employees received approximately half of their weekly pay in cash and the other half by check or through direct deposit into a bank account, while others received their entire weekly pay in cash,"" the statement said. By under-reporting the restaurant's earnings and workers' wages, the business was able to dramatically underpay its sales, income and payroll taxes, Lynch's office said. Grimm calls case 'political witch hunt' Grimm also is charged with conspiring to commit health care fraud and obstructing an official proceeding. Grimm said the investigation was ""a political witch hunt ... to assassinate my character and remove me from office."" He told reporters that he felt ""somewhat relieved"" after the investigation because ""today at least I get to face my accusers."" The indictment comes months after Grimm made headlines when he was shown on camera threatening to throw a reporter over a Capitol Hill balcony after an interview following the State of the Union address. In recent months, public attention also has focused on Grimm's campaign donations after a friend and donor was charged with funneling illegal contributions to his campaign four years ago. The investigation into campaign finance is still ongoing, U.S. officials briefed on the matter have said. CNN's Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report .","NEW: Rep.

"(CNN) -- For centuries, Ras Al Khamiah was a strategic outpost along the ancient silk road trading route. Today, the northernmost of the seven emirates that make up the UAE is often overlooked alongside its extravagant neighbors of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. All that could be set to change, however, with the ruling Al Qasimi family set to make a big push in the region's burgeoning residential and tourism sectors. See also: Visit the Abu Dhabi's fantasy island . International hotel brands such as Hilton and Rixos have moved in while developers are building luxury apartments and villas at a rapid pace. By the end of 2014, Ras Al Khamiah (or RAK as it is often known) will have some 4,800 hotel rooms, a 60% expansion from the start of last year. The government says occupancy is currently running at 73% for beachfront resorts and revenue per room rose a solid 39% in three years. Vice president of operations at Hilton, Christian Grage, believes these rising numbers are only the beginning of what's possible in RAK. The Hotel giant has been in the emirate for more than a dozen years and opened a branch of the Waldorf Astoria there last August. ""We actually are not necessarily surprised about what has come,"" Grage said. ""I would describe it as if you build it they will come. I think we have anticipated the opportunity."" Interactive: What country is the biggest investor in international property? To help fill out RAKs new capacity, Air Arabia, a fast growing budget carrier, is set to move in to replace a struggling local airline. The hope is this partnership will help provide easy access to RAK from the likes of India and Saudi Arabia. A group of international travel experts, meanwhile, are fine tuning a grand master plan to ensure that demand is aligned with all the new hotel and residential inventory coming on stream. The first results of this strategy can be seen at the Al Hamra village where more than 1,000 luxury villas have been already sold to property investors from around the world. See also: Where is world's most expensive luxury property? With prices starting at $1.3 million at entry level and rising to $8 million at the top end, however, investment in Al Hamra doesn't come cheap. These prices equate to a maximum price of $3,800 per square meter ($353 per sq ft), but General Manager of the development, Benoy Kurien, said he is maintaining a sizable discount compared to prices in Dubai. ""(This represents) 20-30% cheaper rates per square meter for any property you buy whether it's an apartment or a villa and that is significant value without compromising,"" Kurien said. The early signs are promising, but whether this rising emirate succeeds in its plans will depend on continued growth as new properties and facilities are completed.","The emirate of Ras Al Khamiah is undergoing a rapid luxury property transformation .

"(CNN) -- Police in British Columbia say a man wanted for allegedly recording himself reaching speeds of at least 186 mph on his motorcycle and posting the video on YouTube has been arrested. Randy George Scott, 25, walked into the Kelowna, British Columbia, police department Tuesday evening, identified himself, and said there was a warrant for his arrest. ""The man allegedly responsible for the infamous YouTube video ""Victoria Highway Run 299km"" is in custody,"" Kelowna police said in a statement. Kelowna is about six hours from Saanich, the town where the incident took place. British Columbia police ID biker who posted video of 186-mph ride . On July 10, charges were filed against Scott after receiving tips from the public identifying him as the motorcycle rider in the video. The Saanich Police Department on Vancouver Island said the incident took place on April 6 on a busy stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway. Video of the ride quickly went viral across the Internet, but Scott was nowhere to be found. In the video, a motorcyclist is seen reaching a speed of 299 kilometers per hour (186 mph) weaving between cars, but authorities think his actual speed may have been even faster. The speedometer tops out at 299 kph. ""You can hear him accelerating even when it says 299 kph,"" Saanich Police Sgt. Dean Jantzen told CNN. The posted speed limit is 80 kph (50 mph). Jantzen said motorcyclists traveling at dangerously excessive speeds are not typical in that part of Saanich, which is more urban. Saanich police said Scott, if convicted of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, could be sentenced up to five years in jail. Police in Kelowna aren't sure why Scott chose their town as the place to surrender, but said they are working with Saanich police investigators on the case. Since Scott surrendered in the same province where he was wanted, the extradition process is less complex, according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Constable Kris Clark. Scott remains in Kelowna police custody and was scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. The full video can be seen at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIUTXIsJz3o . More from CNN Justice: .

"(CNN) -- The global war on drugs has failed, a high-level commission comprised of former presidents, public intellectuals and other leaders studying drug policies concluded in a report released Thursday. International efforts to crack down on drug producers and consumers and to try to reduce demand have had ""devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world,"" the report from the Global Commission on Drug Policy said. The commission, which includes former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, challenges the conventional wisdom about drug markets and drug use. Among the group's recommendations: . -- End of criminalization and stigmatization of people who use drugs but do not harm others . -- Encourage governments to experiment with drug legalization, especially marijuana . -- Offer more harm reduction measures, such as access to syringes . -- Ditch ""just say no"" and ""zero tolerance"" policies for youth in favor of other educational efforts. The theory that increasing law enforcement action would lead to a shrinking drug market has not worked, the report says. To the contrary, illegal drug markets and the organized criminal organizations that traffic them have grown, the group found. The report comes as countries such as Mexico suffer from widespread drug-related violence. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Mexico in the past four years as rival cartels battle each other over lucrative smuggling corridors and as the army fights the cartels. The commission's findings add more high-profile voices to a growing movement calling for a radical approach to drugs. Other leaders, such as former Mexican President Vicente Fox, have called for drug legalization as part of a solution to his country's woes.","Group suggests legalization, access to syringes, new education programs .

"(CNN) -- Milan might be most famous as the capital of Italian fashion and finance, but it's an ambitious architectural project that's generating buzz these days in the home of Armani and Alfa Romeo. Porta Nuova is a new 290,000 square meter (3.12 million square feet) site that will encompass office, residential and green space on the previously neglected outskirts of the city. Building work on the project started in 2009. When finished, it will feature numerous sleek skyscraper buildings that will juxtapose sharply with Milan's more traditional low-rise architecture. As Italy looks to emerge from the Eurozone crisis, there are even some who suggest developments like these could help get the country's economy moving again. ""The made in Italy brand is not just fashion and design and food,"" said Manfredi Catella, CEO of property development and management firm, Hines Italia. ""Now the first (brand) is our land. This is the natural resource of the country. The Middle East have their oil, we have our oil in our land. Now we have to take it back and create value. Porta Nuova is an example,"" Catella added. Valued at more than $2 billion Porta Nuova is 60% financed by European investors with the remaining 40% funded by Qatar holdings. The jewels in the crown of the project are arguably the Bosco Verticale (roughly translated as vertical forest) buildings. The taller of these two residential towers will stand 128 meters (419 feet) high while more than 900 trees will adorn exterior walls and balcony space. A new 231 meter curved tower close by, meanwhile, will house Unicredit Group's European headquarters and cater for 4,000 of the financial services firm's staff. Unicredit's general manager Paolo Fiorentino said the new building could change the way the company structures its premises in the future. ""The feedback (so far) is so positive that we will replicate this project also in other cities like Vienna. We have in mind also Rome but we change the overall headquarters philosophy in the group,"" Fiorentino said. ""In reality what we put under discussion is the way that our people are sharing space."" Major global firms such as Google have also agreed to set up their Italian headquarters here. But while some see progress and opportunity, others are reserving judgment. ""We are not used to certain skylines now you have to lift your head up,"" said local architect and designer, Massimmo Locatelli. ""That new way of building for Milan is really unusual and I guess people expect to get used to it,"" he added. With just under a year to go until the Porta Nuova project is completed, traditionalists now don't have long to savor the city's existing skyline. See also: Suburbia gone wild .

"(CNN) -- It's the innovation hotbed deep in the heart of Texas, the town where the tech and Web world's movers, shakers and up-and-comers descend every spring to learn, network and party at South by Southwest Interactive. Now, Austin, Texas, is showing off an emerging startup scene some hope will make it the Silicon Valley of the Southwest. More than 700 people gathered Tuesday in Austin for the city's inaugural Techstars demo day. At its best, such a demo can give people a brief glimpse into the future of tech, and this event, coupled with Austin's scene, did not disappoint. In return for a 6% stake in the startups, many of which had moved to the Texas capital to participate in the three-month program, the highly competitive Techstars gave these new companies access to a huge network of mentors, a downtown Austin office space and $18,000 in seed funding. Out of 800 applicants, only 10 were accepted. ""The goal is to make this a fantastic place to start companies,"" program manager Jason Seats said. ""If you want to help, dig in. Help them find investors, employees, office space."" Tuesday was graduation day, with dozens of T-shirt-clad founders preparing to lay it all on the line in their quest for investment dollars that would allow them to take their businesses to the next level. The Austin Music Hall was filled with media, mentors and -- most importantly to the startups -- hundreds of potential investors. Here's a look at five of our favorites: . Filament Labs . It makes a health care app designed to help doctors and nurses engage with patients who have chronic medical conditions. We've all left the doctor's office with a folder of homework -- information to read, exercises to do, foods to eat and certain biometrics to monitor. And most of us either lose the folder or ignore the advice. The Filament Labs app is customizable by your health care provider to keep the information on your mobile device specific to you. It's designed to make tracking symptoms of your condition easier and keep communication lines open. If it works, you take better care of yourself, your doctor has a clearer understanding of how you're managing your condition, and you stay healthy. Proto Exchange . Many believe the future of manufacturing lies in 3-D printing for the masses. Right now, there are hundreds of small- to medium-size 3-D printing shops nationwide with big dreams but limited pipelines. Proto Exchange aims to change that. Here's how it works: Currently if a consumer places a last-minute order for 1,000 widgets to be delivered next week, a small company can't deliver in time. So, it either disappoints a customer or can't compete for the business to begin with. Proto Exchange attacks this problem by networking the small manufacturers into a virtual conglomerate that allows them to share resources, outsource large orders and scale up manufacturing quickly. Testlio . Nothing kills a company's reputation like software that doesn't work right. But as Testlio founder Kristel Viidik puts it, ""testing is f***ing hard."" She aims to change that by giving companies easy access to the best mobile app beta-testers around. Testlio has created a network of more than 1,200 professional testers that can be hired to use, abuse and find all the bugs in a mobile app before bringing it to market. Atlas . There's nothing hotter right now than wearable tech, and the Atlas wristband was probably the coolest piece of hardware on display Tuesday. The device is targeted at the exercise marketplace, a field dominated by companies such as Nike, JawBone and Fitbit. CEO Peter Li and co-founders had tried all the gadgets on the market and said they found them to be no more than glorified pedometers -- fun to use for a few weeks but eventually relegated to the sock drawer. For Li, ""the data you got was limited -- steps weren't enough."" Leveraging multiple sensors and advanced algorithms, Atlas has created a device that can differentiate between a whole host of exercises. To demonstrate, the company brought a fitness model on to the stage and showed the Atlas successfully keeping track of everything from biceps curls to squat thrusts. Gone . Keeping with the demo day tradition of casual profanity, Gone CEO Nico Bayerque sums up his company's mission succinctly. ""I'm going to help you get rid of the sh*t you don't need anymore,"" he said. The product takes Craigslist's sell-anything ethos and couples it with Amazon's ease of use and speedy shipping. Simply take a picture of something you want to get rid of, and Gone says it will automatically find the right marketplace to sell it. The company then makes an offer and, if you like it, it will send a prepaid box for shipping. The company also partners with donation and recycling centers in case no one wants to buy what you're selling. Bayerque said that around two-thirds of items in the marketplace get sold while one-third end up being donated. Either way, Gone says, your home will end up less cluttered. The demo day came to a close with Seats, the program manager, exhorting the audience to do more than passively watch the show. He moved to Austin this year to manage the Techstars program, and he wants these new businesses to put down roots in his new home.","Techstars demo day focused on Austin, Texas, startups this week .

"Detroit (CNN) -- Detroit is a place whose story is often told by the numbers. It was home to 2 million residents at its peak, but now the city is down to roughly 700,000. And all of those residents live in a 139-square-mile city grappling with millions of dollars in debt that led the city to file for bankruptcy. But 700,000 people still make their home here. There are square miles of the city that are empty, yes. But the rest of Detroit still has to live somewhere. And where they're living, they're really living. They're operating barber shops and beauty salons, they're working to build Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Durangos at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant, they're going to see the Detroit City Football Club soccer team play at Cass Technical High School. Beyond the abandoned train station and empty Packard Plant is a city slowly making its way back from the brink. What Detroit will look like in the years to come is anyone's guess, but it doesn't mean things have ground to a halt in the meantime. So what do you do in Detroit? Know that you haven't left civilization. Relax. You're in Detroit. It's a city, an American city. It's going through a tough time, sure. Detroit's problems show themselves more than other cities. But assess: Why are you in Detroit? For business? For pleasure? For curiosity? Regardless of why you're here, there will be something here you'll never forget. Welcome, and open your mind. Savor African and African-American art. The great migration out of the rural South that began before World War I coupled with opportunities within the automotive industry made Detroit an enduring stronghold of African-American culture. The city of Detroit is home to one of the largest collectives of black artists, and the Charles H. Wright Museum of African-American History houses one of the world's best-curated collections of art from the African diaspora. Also consider checking out the African Bead Museum, the Shrine of the Black Madonna bookstore and cultural center and pockets of mostly black-owned boutiques, galleries and eateries on the Avenue of Fashion along the northern portion of Livernois Avenue on the city's northwest side. Tour Elmwood Cemetery. There are no more calming places anywhere than cemeteries, but Elmwood is special because of the haunting, Gothic monuments among lush, tree-lined paths. The founding fathers of Detroit -- and Michigan -- are buried here. And while you're on this side of town, head over to Indian Village, the city's premier historic district that once served as home to some of the area's wealthiest auto barons where houses still are maintained and occupied by many of the city's power brokers. Or stop for some coffee at one of the cafes in nearby West Village. Walk Pallister Avenue. Even in a city built around the auto industry, there are hidden gems where your own two feet remain the best mode of transportation. Stroll down the brick-laid, American Foursquare-lined Pallister -- where no cars are allowed. While this residential pedestrian avenue takes you to a quieter, simpler time, it was developed by none other than the workhorses at General Motors. The automaker had its headquarters nearby on West Grand Boulevard and sought to redevelop the area after a slow decline in the 1960s. While the plan didn't quite work out -- GM moved its headquarters downtown in the 1990s -- the residents there have maintained the original vision. And if you're feeling hungry, stop by New Center Eatery nearby for the best chicken and waffles in town. Get hip to the latest pop-ups. The barrier of entry to entrepreneurship is lower in Detroit, and many budding business owners are taking advantage of the pop-up model to establish themselves. And other local talent finds them. Take The Taco Lady, for one: Wherever Detroit native Erica Class' traveling stand Two Dollar Tacos pops up, there's sure to be a good time. Class has connections with nearly all of Detroit's up-and-coming artists and musicians displaying their talents citywide. Look for @TwoDollarTacos on Twitter. Sample culinary creations beyond the coney dog. Get some Asian Corned Beef. There are plenty of nooks and crannies hiding delicacies unique to Detroit that contribute to the city's flavor, and these handmade corned beef concoctions wrapped in egg rolls are hidden gems. True to many locally owned joints, Asian Corned Beef has one place on the west side (13660 Wyoming) and one on the east side (2847 E. Seven Mile). Try our local sport. Football + bowling = Fowling. Got that? The story behind that portmanteau is this: The proprietor of Fowling Warehouse and his family invented a summer game based on horseshoes, except instead of ringing horseshoes around a metal rod, you knock down bowling pins with a football. Sounds easy enough, but veterans of the Detroit-bred sport know better. All the activity at Fowling Warehouse is spur-of-the-moment, so it's not uncommon for one-on-one matches to morph into an all-out dodgeball-style tournament with more footballs and pins. They're in two locations: Sundays at Eastern Market and a new location at a factory -- yes, a factory -- at 3901 Christopher in Hamtramck, a small city surrounded by Detroit. Don't go urban exploring. Why would you want to go into an abandoned building? They're old, they're dangerous, they're full of asbestos. The street cred associated with going through these places is long gone. And most Detroiters are offended if that's the only reason you visit. Lastly, it's illegal -- and with more police on the streets thanks to donated patrol cars and a shift in internal structure, you're running a greater risk. If you'd like to explore a beautiful building, try the Albert Kahn-designed 1928 Fisher Building in New Center, a commercial district north of downtown, or the 1928 Redford Theatre on Lahser Road. Don't ask stupid questions. Yes, 8 Mile is a real place. No, 8 Mile isn't exactly like the movie ""8 Mile."" Don't make assumptions, and use the same common sense in Detroit that you would anywhere else. Remember that people are people. Detroiters are not meant to be ogled like exhibits in a museum. They're not to be talked down to, pitied, shamed or treated with kid gloves. The so-called ""grit,"" ""never-say-die spirit"" and ""determination"" is not unique to Detroiters, either. It's in all of us, everywhere. Say hello. Smile. Shake hands. Be courteous. Be polite. Be normal.

"(CNN) -- Fraternities might seem to have a Stepford-like uniform: khaki pants, flip-flops, T-shirts or maybe Oxford button-downs. One e-mail from 19-year-old Jonathan Weiss proved that it can be far more tailored than that. By now you've probably heard about that e-mail, wherein Weiss tells his fraternity brothers at Emory University's Alpha Tau Omega chapter that they are ""poorly dressed."" The self-proclaimed ""fratshionistau"" then listed a few sartorial tips that have been hailed by GQ and other men's fashion experts as sound advice. His recipe for a well-dressed brother is simple: Wear Earth tones (extra points if you can manage burgundy), cuff your pants, sport a statement scarf and seek inspiration from innovative labels like Japan's Talking About The Abstraction. Oh, and get a tailor, because your clothes don't currently fit your body. To be on the safe side, purchase J.Crew's Ludlow suit. A native of Columbus, Ohio, Weiss said he had long ascribed to the fashion ""my parents decided for me,"" which he calls ""eccentric rower preppy."" He's now drawn to a more nostalgic ""Americana"" style, thanks to a freshman-year introduction to Beat poetry. (Weiss is dual majoring in English and neuroscience.) ""I fell in love with 1950s America, this idea of refining yourself. You look at the fashion they had and the way (the Beat poets) dressed and what they inspired, being very nationalistic, very cool. I got inspired by that,"" he said. Conveniently, key items from Beatnik styles are available at modern malls, he said, like cardigan sweaters (Weiss prefers Ralph Lauren's rugby collection), chukka boots a la J.Crew or Clarks, and thick-rimmed Warby Parkers. ""Americana"" style encompasses a lot of looks, said Esquire's senior associate market editor, Nic Screws: ""Everything from American-made heritage brands to prep to regional influences. Red Wing boots, Repp ties and nautical stripes can all be considered Americana."" The young man's fashion takedown might seem like a bold change from the ""Animal House"" fraternity stereotype (and a bold move for a new brother), but according to G. Bruce Boyer, a contributing editor to Town & Country, the looks Weiss advocates have roots on campus. Although it might feel like high style on the average college campus these days, fraternity members at Princeton, Yale and Harvard were running counter to the formal fashion of the early 1900s. With colorful scarves and sport coats, the Ivy League elite pioneered casual, stylish men's fashion, said Boyer, who co-curated a recent exhibition of Ivy League fashion at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. ""It only became this new-conservative look of the Eastern establishment in the 1950s,"" Boyer said. Post-World War II, it became a status symbol, a look associated with power, Boyer said. It was revived in the early 1980s, when it became known as ""preppy."" The current revival of Ivy League style, and the broader Americana look, is driven by close, fitted Italian tailoring and Japanese fashion sense, Boyer said. The notion that clothes have a deeper, non-verbal communication is something Weiss subscribes to. ""I view fashion as a means to present yourself before you open your mouth,"" said Weiss, the self-proclaimed ""apparel chair"" of his Alpha Tau Omega chapter. ""It's another way for you to communicate with someone. It's not the only way, of course. I think the content of what you say is more important than how you look, but it can hinder or further how you frame your message."" Boyer couldn't agree more: ""Not only do clothes talk, but they never shut up. You keep looking at people, you learn more and more about them from their clothes."" ""One thing that interested me about (Weiss) is, he is very much aware of the details,"" Boyer said. ""Mentioning the Earth tones and cuffed trousers: He was aware that that little, two-inch strip of cloth at the bottom of your legs was somehow important, that that cuff somehow separated the men from the boys, the well-dressed from the not-well-dressed, the knowing from the not knowing."" Understanding fashion is what Weiss feels he can contribute to Alpha Tau Omega. Counter to the stereotypes of hazing, lecherous, binge-drinking party animals, he said, fraternity life is about trying to ""find kindred spirits that you can connect with on a deeper level."" Weiss hopes to one day own a store in his Ohio hometown with his older sister, who is interning in the fashion industry while pursuing a law degree in New York. For now, he said, his fraternity brothers welcomed his e-mail with good humor and respect for his opinion, even if they didn't share his passion for fashion. They continued to encouraged him when the note spread on the Internet, despite some bloggers and journalists calling it ""ridiculous."" ""Some might have seen this as a negative, 'Oh, how embarrassing' kind of thing,"" Weiss said, but, ""I only received support from (my brothers.) I guess a thank you note is in order.""","Emory student Jonathan Weiss wanted to help his fraternity brothers dress better .

"(CNN) -- When Barack Obama won the U.S. election four years ago, his Kenyan half sister Auma was with her family at their homestead, watching the historic occasion on television. It was a night Auma Obama remembers well. ""We had a lot of people visiting to watch with us,"" she says. ""There was a lot of excitement because it had been such a tough race. There was a sense of relief that all the hard work had paid off."" Alongside Auma and her family was filmmaker Branwen Okpako, who was making a documentary about Auma, ""The Education of Auma Obama, "" which is being shown in London Tuesday to coincide with the U.S. election and as part of the Film Africa festival. ""I will never forget that period in their homestead,"" says Okpako. ""It was indescribable. Imagine something like that is happening to your family, yet so far away."" Okpako, 43, a Nigerian-born filmmaker living in Germany, became friends with Auma when they were both film students in Berlin in the early 1990s. ""We were two of four African women studying at the film school at the time and we talked a lot about how the African continent was portrayed in film and how we wanted to change it,"" says Okpako. Auma shares a father -- Barack Senior -- with her younger half brother, Barack. The pair did not meet until after their father died in 1982 and Barack got in touch with Auma to explore his Kenyan roots. Watch video: Auma Obama on meeting her half brother Barack . Okpako had the idea for a film about her friend Auma in the run-up to the 2008 election. Auma recalls: ""I wasn't particularly enthusiastic when Branwen first suggested the film, but I agreed because she is a friend and I trusted her. If it had been a stranger, I don't think I would have done it."" Okpako says Auma was initially reticent about the film because of the huge media interest in her family that came with Barack Obama's rise to prominence. ""It has put me in the limelight in a way that wouldn't have happened otherwise,"" says Auma. ""I don't like talking about my family but it's great if it gives me the chance to talk about my work with deprived and underprivileged children."" Auma, who lives in Nairobi, traveled with Okpako to the family's homestead in the village of Kogelo, where her grandmother lives and Barack Senior is buried. ""We were sitting together for 10 days waiting for the election and reflecting how we got to this moment in time,"" says Okpako. ""We were reading the newspapers and reading the statistics, but of course we didn't know what was going to happen. It was intense and full of anticipation. ""The film deals with that moment in time when history was made, but also how they got to that moment."" She adds: ""All the family was there, the grandmother, all the cousins. Once the result was known everybody in the village came into the compound to celebrate. There must have been hundreds of people there."" Also on Inside Africa: 'Zambezia': 3D animation puts South Africa film in the picture . Auma Obama grew up in the family's homestead in Kogelo before moving to Germany where she spent 16 years as a journalist, broadcaster and studied for a PhD in German literature. She then lived for a period in the United Kingdom before returning to Kenya, where she works now as a social worker and youth advocate. The film is partly a fly-on-the-wall documentary about the family watching the 2008 election from their homestead, and partly uses interviews and old footage to tell the family's story. Okpako traveled with Auma Obama to many significant places in her life to trace her story. She had hoped to interview Barack Obama for the film, but was unable to arrange time with the president. ""I thought it would be good to have him as a small character in a film about an African woman, but it wasn't possible,"" she said. The president did, however, get to hear about the film when the cameraman's mother-in-law visited the White House with German chancellor Angela Merkel and told him about it. ""He asked for a copy and we sent it, but I don't know if he has watched it,"" says Okpako. ""I think it would be interesting for him to see what his Kenyan family was doing that day."" Also on Inside Africa: Artist joins Nigeria's 'cultural explosion' ""The Education of Auma Obama"" will be shown in London on this year's election day, Tuesday, November 6, as part of the Film Africa festival, and Okpako will be there for a question and answer session with the audience. Auma says she has to work on election day, but she will still be watching events unfold. ""I follow my brother's career as closely as any sibling would,"" she says. ""It's important for me to know whether or not he is happy in his job,"" she adds. ""He makes me very proud because he has a tough job and does it 100% to his ability."" The film premiered at last year's Toronto International Film Festival and has won awards at the PanAfrican Film Festival in Los Angeles and the Africa International Film Festival in Lagos.","Auma Obama shares a father with the U.S. president .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a bird that couldn't fit in your living room because its wings were too big. That's exactly what would happen if you tried to bring the Pelagornis sandersi home -- assuming houses and humans existed back then. Scientists have identified the fossils of what could be the largest flying bird ever found. With an estimated 20- to 24-foot wingspan, the extinct P. sandersi was twice the size of today's biggest flying bird, the royal albatross, according to the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in North Carolina. Researchers believe the P. sandersi lived about 25 million to 28 million years ago. 53 spectacular wildlife photos from around the world . The avian giant's long, slender wings and paper-thin hollow bones allowed it to stay aloft for long distances without flapping its wings, the center said. But that doesn't mean the mammoth bird didn't have size issues while trying to fly. Because it was probably too big to take off from a standstill, the P. sandersi may have had to run downhill into a headwind to achieve takeoff -- just like a hang glider would. The bird's fossils were first unearthed 31 years ago when construction workers started working on a new terminal at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina. The remains -- including a complete skull and multiple wing and leg bones -- were so big they had to be dug up with a backhoe. But the weight of the discovery wasn't publicized until this week, when scientists unveiled the findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The remains of the P. sandersi now rest in the Charleston Museum. The big bird's name honors retired Charleston Museum curator Albert Sanders.

"(CNN) -- Jonathan Winters, the wildly inventive actor and comedian who appeared in such films as ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and ""The Loved One"" and played Robin Williams' son on the TV show ""Mork & Mindy,"" has died. He was 87. Winters died Thursday evening of natural causes at his home in Montecito, California, according to business associate Joe Petro III. Winters was known for his comic irreverence, switching characters the way other people flick on light switches. His routines were full of non sequiturs and surreal jokes. Williams, in particular, often credited him as a great influence. ""First he was my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend,"" tweeted Williams. ""I'll miss him huge. He was my Comedy Buddha. Long live the Buddha."" Winters, who was widely admired by comedians in general, was awarded the Mark Twain Prize -- which goes to outstanding humorists -- in 1999. ""Genius"" was a common touchstone as comedians reacted to Winters' death. ""R.I.P Jonathan Winters,"" tweeted comedian and filmmaker Albert Brooks. ""Beyond funny, he invented a new category of comedic genius."" ""Had a great run. Actual genius,"" tweeted Kevin Pollak. ""A genius and the greatest improvisational comedian of all time,"" tweeted Richard Lewis. Gottfried: Jonathan Winters was mad brilliant . Though he never had a breakout starring role, over the years his appearances on TV shows made him a beloved figure in the entertainment world. He was a favorite guest on ""The Tonight Show"" -- particularly in the early '60s when Jack Paar hosted it -- and turned up on the game show ""The Hollywood Squares,"" Dean Martin's celebrity roasts and countless variety shows. He told the Archive of American Television about the creation of his character Maude Frickert, the sarcastic old lady, who came from a relative he had. ""I decided, having seen a lot of older people, that many of them are shelved -- put in retirement homes to rot,"" he said. ""I decided to (be) a hip old lady"" -- one who had a wicked sense of humor, the kind of person who was married 12 times and cracked a whip in a ward of cardiac patients. Other characters included Elwood P. Suggins, B.B. Bindlestiff and Lance Loveguard. He had a regular role on the final season of ""Mork & Mindy,"" putting him together with Williams, who played the space visitor Mork from Ork. Winters played Mearth, Mork's son, who -- having hatched from a giant egg -- was the size of an adult but had the mind of a child. The attempted pairing of Williams and Winters was expected to create comic fireworks, but the show's already falling ratings didn't pick up, and ""Mork & Mindy"" was canceled in 1982. Winters showed his range with the occasional dramatic role. In an episode of ""The Twilight Zone,"" he played a shark-like pool player. In the 1994 film ""The Shadow"" -- with Alec Baldwin as the hero with the ability to cloud men's minds -- he played Baldwin's police chief uncle. He was also a prolific recording artist, producing more than a dozen comedy records, including 1960's ""The Wonderful World of Jonathan Winters."" Winters was born November 11, 1925, in Dayton, Ohio. He developed his talent for characters and voices from a young age. After serving in World War II, he married his wife, Eileen, in 1948 and hoped to become an artist. That career went nowhere, but his wife encouraged him to enter a talent contest. His win there earned him a position as a disc jockey on a local radio station, making up some of his interviewees. Eventually he left for New York, becoming a nightclub comic and earning spots on ""The Tonight Show."" In 1961, Winters suffered a nervous breakdown. He spent eight months in a mental institution and was diagnosed as bipolar. ""It was one of the toughest times in my life,"" he told the Archive of American Television. But when he got out -- on April Fools' Day, 1962 -- he almost immediately got a call from director Stanley Kramer, offering him a role in ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."" Kramer was one of the most highly regarded directors in Hollywood, known for ""The Defiant Ones"" and ""Judgment at Nuremberg."" He was reluctant about taking the role until his wife pushed him. ""You'd better take it, because you'll never work again if you don't take it,"" he recalled her saying. In the 1963 film, filled with comedy all-stars, Winters stood out as a truck driver who destroys a gas station. He was, many agreed, one of a kind. ""The first time I saw Jonathan Winters perform, I thought I might as well quit the business,"" tweeted Dick Van Dyke after hearing of Winters' death. ""Because, I could never be as brilliant.""

"(CNN) -- For many political observers, last night's loss by Eric Cantor was one of the biggest shocks of our political careers. The Republican House majority leader was easily defeated by an almost unknown challenger whom he heavily outspent. It's been reported that Cantor's team spent more on steakhouses than his opponent did on his entire campaign. No one had a clue this was about to happen, including Cantor himself. Just days before the primary, his camp leaked an internal poll showing him ahead by 34 points. No House majority leader has lost a primary since the position was created in 1899. While the result was unexpected, it confirms something we already knew. In the Republican civil war, the tea party has won. It's more than just Cantor's loss. A week earlier, Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, was forced into a runoff by tea party candidate Chris McDaniel. And the Republican primary winner in Maine's 2nd Congressional District is closely connected to Gov. Paul LePage and his disastrous tea party agenda that has hurt the state. And even the candidates who are supposed to be the establishment have been pulled so far to the right by tea party challengers that there is no difference in their policies or rhetoric. Mitch McConnell held off his primary opponent only by leaving no room for him to run, opposing anything and everything offered by President Barack Obama. Now, as the embodiment of partisan obstruction in Washington, he'll have trouble against Alison Lundergan Grimes, a mainstream Democratic candidate. As majority leader, Cantor guided House Republicans' vastly out-of-touch agenda. Perhaps that is why it was so difficult for political operatives to believe that he could be defeated by a challenger alleging that he was not conservative enough. Cantor has gone out of his way to set an agenda that appeals to the Republican Party's tea party wing, at the expense of middle-class families who could have benefited from the preferred mainstream approach of Democrats. But apparently, he was just not extreme enough for today's GOP. The repercussions of Cantor's loss will reverberate for Republicans. Opinion: Real lesson in Cantor's loss -- Beware conventional wisdom . Their far right agenda is already hurting them in general elections. I shudder to think what Republican presidential contenders will say in a 2016 primary to win over voters who think Eric Cantor isn't conservative enough. But even this year, the effect will be felt. We're only about halfway through the primary calendar. In addition to the Mississippi Senate runoff, Iowa's 3rd Congressional District will hold a convention next week to select their candidate. The last time the state used a convention, we wound up with Rep. Steve King. On Tuesday night, New York Republican Peter King expressed his fear that the results ""will move the party further to the right, which will marginalize us further as a national party."" He doesn't need to look any further than his home state to see how the tea party is relegating the Republican Party to the sidelines. Opinion: Who said the tea party was dead? We'll also see how Cantor's loss affects tea party primary challenges this summer in New Hampshire and Arizona. The Democratic Party and its candidates remain committed to helping provide economic security to middle-class families and addressing serious issues such as commonsense immigration reform. Meanwhile, Republican Party one-upsmanship to appeal to the tea party base threatens to keep their party in the minority and out of the White House for the foreseeable future.

"(CNN) -- High up in the Heritage Foundation's headquarters, a conservative ""who's who"" gathered last week to screen a movie. Conservative media critic Brent Bozell III, who once called much of Hollywood's work ""clearly out of bounds, offensive and dangerous,"" heaped praise on the production and its producer. The producer was famously liberal, award-winning movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who has produced some of Hollywood's most controversial films. The film is ""The Giver"" -- based on the 1993 Newberry Medal-winning novel by Lois Lowry -- which hit big screens Friday. The dystopian story is based on a script shepherded into production by actor Jeff Bridges, a Hollywood liberal icon who some are floating as a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Montana. (Bridges has ruled out a run.) ""The Giver,"" which stars Bridges and liberal donor and actress Meryl Streep, tells the story of Jonas, a boy living in a seeming utopia without hunger, pain or war who breaks free of the stifling, colorless ""sameness"" when he learns the true horror of how this idyllic state is achieved -- through coercion and memory suppression. Box office report: 'The Giver' rounds out top 5 . Conservatives like Bozell and Heritage Foundation president and former Sen. Jim DeMint see a not-so-subtle message against overreaching government power. ""The Giver"" demonstrates how even well-intended government can wind up crushing individual freedoms, turning utopian dreams into dystopian reality. ""It's refreshing to see Hollywood produce a cautionary tale that demonstrates the danger and sadness inherent in relying on government to protect us from all unpleasantness,"" DeMint told CNN. Review: 'The Giver' based on cerebral gobbledygook . Weinstein disputes the political message that conservatives like DeMint see at the movie's core. He told CNN the movie was made ""without a political agenda. Lois Lowry's iconic novel was written to make us all think about the importance of things like free choice, emotions and family, and the movie stays very true to that."" The film is being co-produced by Weinstein and Walden Media, a company owned by billionaire Phil Anschutz that has previously backed family-values fare like the C.S. Lewis-derived series ""Chronicles of Narnia"" and pushes ""life-affirming"" messages in its films. In addition to numerous business interests, Anschutz owns the conservative Weekly Standard magazine. In contrast to Anschutz's tame productions, Weinstein has previously backed content like the ""Kill Bill"" franchise that has pushed boundaries for its ubiquitous violence. Bozell, who as recently as January feuded with Weinstein over his films' content, offered praise for ""The Giver"" and Weinstein's production. Trailer Park: 'The Giver' ""The movie is the complete package -- a good story, well told. ... I tip my hat to (Weinstein). It's really laudable that he would do this,"" Bozell told CNN. Other prominent cultural conservatives are lining up to praise the film's message. Catholic Archbishop of Philadelphia Charles Chaput dedicated part of his weekly column to the film, saying, ""This is a wonderful film. Nothing in the movie version of The Giver will offend a family."" University of Southern California professor and expert on Hollywood politics Steven Ross chalks up the strange bedfellows behind ""The Giver"" to money. ""Politics is politics, business is business,"" he said. ""Hollywood is first and foremost a profit-making industry."" 'The Giver': Jeff Bridges' 18-year dream comes true . Ross thinks the partnership results in Weinstein's group hoping to tap a huge opportunity in the Christian and family values market, while conservative activists ""are thrilled to get their message out into the mainstream."" Bozell agrees that conservatives need to embrace Hollywood's quality while staying true to their values; that family values and conservative-themed films need to be ""more professional"" to be effective. For his part, Weinstein is ""thrilled that the movie is getting fans from both conservatives and liberals. It shows how universal ideals apply to both sides of the political aisle alike, and maybe Washington and the world's leaders can learn something from 'The Giver.' "" Calls for comment by CNN to Walden Media and Anschutz were not immediately returned.","""The Giver"" is based on Lois Lowry's 1993 Newberry Medal-winning novel .

"(CNN) -- Hours after two robbery suspects shot at police and took eight people hostage, the standoff inside a suburban Chicago home continued early Wednesday . Authorities got their first indication of trouble in the form of a 911 call about a robbery around 2:40 p.m. Tuesday (3:40 p.m. ET), said Harvey, Illinois, police spokesman Sean Howard. Two officers responding to that call were injured by gunfire. Sometime afterward, the suspects entered a home and took the hostages, according to Harvey police spokesman. Law officers from all over Illinois then surrounded the residence and began the process of negotiating with the hostage-takers. Throughout the night, the suspects released four children. Two adults and two children remained hostages late Tuesday night, Howard said. Harvey Mayor Eric Kellogg wants residents to stay inside their own homes as police, who have blocked off nearby streets, deal with the situation. Both wounded officers are at a local hospital. One of them was grazed by a bullet and is in stable condition, while the other is in good condition, according to Howard. A city of about 25,000 people, Harvey is about 20 miles south of Chicago.

"(CNN) -- Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman! What the heck was that flaming thing streaking across Australian skies? Australians in cities from Melbourne to Brisbane reported -- and, in some cases, filmed -- a large, burning object crossing the sky last week. Unlike the meteor that hit Russia in February 2013, this sky phenomenon was manmade. Scientists quickly realized that it was the third stage of a Russian Soyuz rocket used to launch a weather satellite July 8. Some, like Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Nobel Prize-winning Australian astronomer Brian Schmidt (@cosmicpinot), spread the news on Twitter. Although the Down Under fireworks were spectacular enough to be alarming, most space debris falls harmlessly to Earth, completely unnoticed. Some spacecraft parts fall within days of launch but most over considerably longer time scales. In the nearly six decades since Sputnik became the first satellite to orbit the Earth in 1957, humans have launched 7,500 satellites into orbit, according to McDowell. Those in low Earth orbit -- about 300 miles up -- travel through a very thin atmosphere that acts as a gradual brake on the satellite trajectory. Absent any human intervention, those satellites slowly spiral toward Earth over 10 or 20 years, depending on their exact orbit and the spacecraft shape. The Hubble Space Telescope has been in low Earth orbit for 24 years and counting only because astronauts boosted it back to a higher orbit at every space shuttle servicing visit. More than a thousand active satellites are orbiting the Earth right now. Slightly more than half are in low Earth orbit, including Hubble and the space station. Almost all the rest are in geosynchronous orbit, meaning they circle the Earth at the same rate it rotates. For a telecommunications company serving the U.S., it's obviously a big advantage to have a satellite hovering above the country all the time. A geosynchronous 24-hour orbital period requires a very high-altitude orbit. According to Newton's 400-year-old law of gravity, orbital speed depends only on the mass of the body being orbited (in this case, the Earth) and the radius of the orbit (the radius of the Earth plus the height of the satellite above the Earth). That's why Hubble, the much larger space station, the much smaller early satellites like Sputnik and Explorer I, and any other low Earth-orbit satellite take only 90 minutes to circle the globe. Geosynchronous satellites are way, way up there. Those orbits won't decay anytime soon. It's the low Earth orbit satellites that will fall down. Or rather, the dead satellite and related debris that can't be controlled by engineers at space agencies. Active satellites can be controlled from the ground; for example, Hubble is continually repointed from one part of the sky to another as it observes this galaxy or that star. As the blockbuster movie ""Gravity"" showed us, uncontrolled space debris can be very dangerous. In the movie, a Russian missile destroys a defunct satellite, starting a destructive and deadly chain reaction of debris destroying other satellites destroying still more satellites -- and, ultimately, destroying the space station in which the astronauts were based. In 1985, the U.S. demonstrated anti-missile Star Wars capabilities by blowing up a solar observatory named P78. Not only did this halt the science, it created a swarm of tiny pieces of debris. China did a similar thing in 2007. As physics tells us, blowing something up doesn't make it vanish; it just makes lots of tiny pieces moving more quickly. And smaller pieces are much harder to spot and track. The U.S. Strategic Command tracks space objects. Its Joint Space Operations Center has catalogued more than 39,000 manmade objects in orbit. About 60% have re-entered the atmosphere; 16,000 remain in orbit today. Of these, only about 5% are functioning satellites or payloads that can be controlled, while 95% is inactive space junk, including rocket bodies. NASA estimates that there are half a million pieces of space junk floating around the Earth, most too small to be tracked. But even bits of debris no bigger than a gumdrop can cause serious damage. Satellite technology has made it easy to phone around the globe, to a metropolis or even to Mount Everest. The downside is, pieces of satellites are going to fall back onto Earth. Thankfully, only the largest solid hunks fail to burn up before reaching the ground. In 1979, NASA's Skylab (a much earlier version of the space station) famously fell to Earth amid nail-biting worry. A few scraps were recovered in Australia (poor Australia, again!). Bits of ROSAT (a German X-ray astronomy observatory) and other satellites have also fallen to Earth. It is easy to calculate the path of the re-entering spacecraft because it is along the track of the orbit. But how quickly it descends depends on details that are much harder to predict. It makes a big difference how the structure burns and how it falls apart. Bigger pieces continue to hurtle downward while smaller pieces burn completely high up in the atmosphere. That's why predictions of where space debris will land are notoriously uncertain. The good news is that only one-quarter of the surface of the Earth is land, and most of that is uninhabited. So damage to people and property is rare. Most falling space debris lands harmlessly and with no witnesses. The likelihood of serious damage is very low. But a big hunk of metal -- or a large asteroid -- falling in the wrong place could be catastrophic. It's definitely a good idea to keep the Skylab-sized space junk controllable and to catalog asteroids that will pass near the Earth. But in the end, whether we go the way of the dinosaurs might just be down to luck.","A piece of space junk from a Russian rocket flew through the Australian sky .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Ecuador on Saturday extended a state of emergency indefinitely, an action that mobilizes the military to be in charge of securing the country instead of the police. The extension comes after President Rafael Correa was attacked by police on September 30. The decree in the capital city of Quito was scheduled to expire Friday. Troops rescued Correa in a dramatic shootout with officers at a hospital, where Correa said he was held for more than 10 hours. Police officers have said they were angered by a new law that would take away their bonuses and reduce their compensation. Correa, who was roughed up and hit by tear gas, said the law would do no such thing and the police officers had not read it. He described the events as an attempted coup. However, a congressman from the opposition party told Colombia-based Caracol TV, a CNN affiliate, that the day's events were provoked and planned by Correa. ""Everything was staged by the president to hide the extreme corruption and to hide the poverty, hunger and unemployment that have risen to an alarming level,"" said Gilmar Gutierrez, a congressman and brother of former president Lucio Gutierrez, the man Correa claimed was behind the coup attempt. ""There was no coup,"" Gutierrez said Monday. Interior Minister Gustavo Jalkh said at least four people were killed in the standoff -- two soldiers, a police officer and a university student. Nearly 200 others were injured in unrest throughout the country, authorities said.","Authorities extend the decree indefinitely .

"(CNN) -- Molly Pearce has had what her mother dryly calls ""a very alternative life"" since birth because of her chronic health issues. The 24-year-old Santa Monica, California, woman has Hirschsprung's disease, a rare congenital disorder that obstructs the large intestine due to an absence of nerve cells that regulate muscle movement. She never attended public school full time, has been in and out of hospitals since she was a newborn, and discovered that the one thing she can eat without getting sick is a bag of Cheetos. Now, Pearce needs four organs -- a liver, kidney, pancreas and small intestine -- from a deceased type O donor to live. ""It's a pretty unusual circumstance,"" said Dr. Alan Langnas, chief of transplantation at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, where Pearce is being treated. ""Fortunately, she's young, and youth trumps everything. She's in very good shape relative to her condition."" At birth, Pearce was one of only three people in the world with her particular type of disease, and doctors predicted she wouldn't live beyond her first year. Growing up, ""I would go to school when I could, but I didn't know anybody and always felt left out,"" Pearce said. ""Most of the time I felt OK, but I was really in a fragile state. I just wanted to be a normal kid."" Why I donated my bone marrow . Pearce managed her disease as well as possible but experienced a major setback at 12 when she was given a drug too powerful for someone of her size. It destroyed her small intestine and her kidney, forcing her onto a liquid diet. It wasn't until she was 17 that she received a small intestine transplant, and at 18 she accepted one of her mother's kidneys. Then, in 2011, a negative reaction to a blood transfusion caused widespread intestinal failure. Doctors removed both transplants last fall and advised her that they would have to remove her pancreas and her liver as well. By December, she was on dialysis and had lost all four organs. ""I was so depressed that I was telling my mother and everyone that I didn't want to live anymore,"" Pearce said. ""I just wanted to give up because of how many things had gone wrong. After a few months, I realized I could either die or try to get better -- and I at least wanted to try."" After successfully overcoming pneumonia this year, she was exposed to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a skin-borne infection common to hospitals that is difficult to treat. With a severely weakened immune system, she remains in an isolation room, where is she being fed through a tube. She has not eaten solid food since November. ""It's a complex operation,"" Langnas said of the quadruple transplant, ""but it's her only opportunity for survival and a reasonably good quality of life."" Fortunately, Pearce and her family are no longer alone in their quest for a donor. The New York-based Flood Sisters Kidney Foundation of America has taken up Pearce's cause after reading about her on Facebook. CEO Jennifer Flood and her two sisters, Cynthia and Heather, started their organization after finding a kidney donor for their father in 2008 through the popular classified website Craigslist. They have since capitalized on the power of the Internet and social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter to give patients more publicity and pair them with donors more quickly. ""We knew right away this was a rare and challenging case,"" Jennifer Flood said. ""Molly's story reminded us of the journey we went through for our father, and we had faith and confidence in knowing we could help."" A tale of two transplants . The foundation educates the public on the organ donation and transplant process through online efforts as well as at fund-raising events around the country. The Flood sisters have saved six lives so far -- and they said they hope Pearce is next. ""It has been a unique, eye-opening, challenging and empowering experience,"" Jennifer Flood said. ""We are confident that with more awareness and exposure ... we can help Molly receive a special family or individual to come forward and donate the gift of life."" Typically, patients seeking organ transplants register as candidates for the national waiting list through the United Network for Organ Sharing after receiving medical clearance from their hospitals. They can either attempt independently to find a family member, friend or stranger to donate to them, or they can wait their turn on the list. Cases are reviewed based on how sick a patient is, but even though someone such as Pearce is near the top of the list, about 117,000 other patients vie for potential donations, according to United Network for Organ Sharing. The process can take anywhere from two to 10 years. The Flood sisters help patients expedite that waiting period by providing them with a list of potential donors, helping them choose the right hospital and referring them to organizations that can assist with medical expenses. Once matched with a living donor, a patient contacts his or her hospital, and the transplant occurs once the donor has been medically cleared by a series of tests. Patients who need the organs of a deceased individual must also wait on the list, as United Network for Organ Sharing determines where to allocate these organs. But patients can take the initiative to find a family with a terminally ill loved one and have them consent to donate that person's organs after he or she has died -- an option the Flood sisters are exploring for Pearce. Many people are unaware of that option, so it doesn't happen often. ""We hope that Molly's story is the first step toward changing how families can choose where their loved one's organs are allocated,"" Jennifer Flood said. ""It is such a confidential process when it doesn't have to be. This new procedure can make a family or individual feel empowered and not directed to a system. It makes the donation process more personable."" Pearce's mother describes her daughter as a bright, inquisitive young woman whose resilience has always belied her physical condition. ""She has a tremendous love for animals -- she's shown horses and done a lot of work at shelters,"" Melisa Pearce said. ""She has never seen herself as weak -- she has always been the person who fights for the underdog."" A race for life: Double lung transplant woman sails Atlantic . Molly Pearce's boyfriend of four years, Corey Eaker, stayed with her in the hospital for a month over the holidays. A geography major in his final semester at California State University, Northridge, he met Pearce when they were both enrolled at Santa Monica College. ""It was tough to be there and see everything that she was going through,"" he said. ""We're pretty positive, but we always look at the other side a bit and think, 'What if?' And then we use each other to remind ourselves that we can't think about that and to keep a positive outlook."" Pearce said the support from her family, as well from as strangers who have written to her after reading her story, has been overwhelming. ""I'm hopeful,"" she said. ""We did it once, and I'm determined to do it again.""","Doctors predicted Molly Pearce wouldn't live past her first year .

"(CNN)  -- A new national poll appears to validate the adage that time heals all wounds, at least when it comes to two former presidents of the United States. Former Presidents George H.W. Bush, left, and Jimmy Carter can smile now about their performance in polls. Sixty percent of Americans questioned in a CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning say they approve of how George H.W. Bush handled his job as president, and 64 percent give a thumbs up to former President Carter. Those numbers are about double the approval ratings each had when he was voted out of office after one term. ""Time has been kind to the former presidents,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. ""Carter's approval rating was just 31 percent on the eve of the 1980 election, and was at 34 percent in late December of that year, the last measure taken during his presidency. But now 64 percent approve of how Carter handled his job as president.""  Watch what time does to presidents while in office » . The poll was released hours before Bush and Carter, along with former President Clinton, sit down for lunch at the White House with President Bush and President-elect Barack Obama. Carter lost the 1980 presidential election to Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush lost the 1992 contest to Clinton. ""The elder Bush had a 34 percent approval rating just before the 1992 election, although the Americans felt better about him once they booted him from office and his rating rose to 56 percent by January 1993,"" Holland said. ""Now 60 percent give his presidency a positive rating."" Clinton's approval rating stood at 66 percent when he finished his second term in 2001, and he gets a slightly better rating -- 69 percent -- today. The most recent CNN/Opinion Research poll on the outgoing Bush, taken in late December, found his approval rating at 27 percent. ""The current occupant of the White House probably hopes history will treat him as kindly as it did his predecessors,"" Holland said. None of those ratings compare with Obama's, who has seen approval ratings as high as 82 percent during the presidential transition, Holland said. The CNN/Opinion Research poll was conducted December 19-21, with 1,013 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is 3 percentage points.","Ex-Presidents Carter, George H.W.

"(CNN) -- Baseball legend Barry Bonds will get another day in court to convince judges he did not obstruct justice during a federal investigation into illegal steroids use by pro athletes. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco issued an order Tuesday to have the case reheard by a larger panel of judges. Last year a three-judge panel of that court upheld the former San Francisco Giants star's conviction. ""Upon the vote of a majority of nonrecused active judges, it is ordered that this case be reheard,"" the brief court order Tuesday read. In 2011 Bonds was on trial facing three counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice stemming from the illegal steroid investigation within major league baseball. A mistrial was declared on the three counts of perjury after jurors reported they could not reach an agreement, but the jury did convict Bonds of one count of obstruction of justice and he was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $4,000. Jurors said at the time they found Bonds to be ""evasive"" in his testimony to the federal grand jury investigating illegal steroids use by pro athletes, but they said that it was not proven that he lied when he said he had not knowingly used steroids. Since then Bonds, 49, has tried to get the conviction overturned.","Baseball Legend Barry Bonds gets another hearing .

"(CNN) -- Israel has shot down an unmanned aerial vehicle that entered Israeli airspace near the Syrian border on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed. The drone was destroyed by a Patriot surface-to-air missile over Quneitra in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. ""In spite of the IDF's sensitivity to recent occurrences in the proximity of the border, we have repeatedly stated that we will respond to any breach of Israel's sovereignty and will continue to act to maintain safety and security to the civilians of the State of Israel,"" Lerner added. This is the first drone from Syria that Israel has shot down, although the IDF has shot down UAVs from Hamas and Hezbollah before. It's unclear which group in war-torn Syria was operating the UAV and why. It could have been the embattled government of President Bashar al-Assad or any of a number of rebel fighting groups or militant organizations. The downing of the drone is the latest development in the Golan Heights on the Israeli-Syrian border, where United Nations peacekeepers were attacked on Saturday. U.N. officials said they were working to gain the release of dozens of peacekeepers detained by Islamist fighters when the attack occurred. The U.N. has not identified the group responsible for detaining at least 44 peacekeepers, but an Israeli military official told CNN Syrian militants are behind the incident . Al-Nusra Front fighters and other Syrian rebels seized control of the Syrian side of the Quneitra crossing last week -- a capture that represents a new dynamic in a war long feared not only for its deadly effects inside Syria but for threatening to widen into a destabilizing regional conflict. Syria is in turmoil as a bloody yearslong civil war rages on. The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force has been in place in the Golan Heights since 1974 to maintain a ceasefire between Israel and Syria. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War and fought off an attempt by Syria in 1973 to retake the rocky plateau. In 1981, Israel annexed the Golan Heights. It is considered by the international community to be occupied territory. EXCLUSIVE: Boy, 13, witnesses beheadings .

"(CNN) -- Investigators looking into the crash of a Malaysia Airlines jet over Ukraine face a series of unusual challenges. From access to the debris, to volatile militant activity in the area, here's a look at some investigation concerns after the plane with 298 people aboard fell from the sky. Who will lead the investigation? The answer is not so clear-cut. But aviation experts say an investigation should not include parties involved in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said experts from the International Civilian Aviation Organization, an agency of the United Nations, have joined the Netherlands, Malaysia and the United States on a special commission. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called for an international team to have full access to the crash site. What will happen to plane's data recorders? The families of people on board will demand a transparent international investigation, and so will the global community, CNN aviation analyst Richard Quest said. Finding and examining the plane's data recorders will be key -- but the fact that the crash occurred in such a volatile region makes what comes next anything but certain, CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. ""The big question will be, in whose hands will they fall, and will this be a really objective, international investigation?"" he said. Who will win the blame game? Washington and Kiev have said it was a surface-to-air missile that brought down the Boeing 777, though the United States couldn't say who fired the weapon. Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, said in a Facebook post that ""terrorists"" fired on the plane operating a Buk surface-to-air missile system. Malaysia's government said it wasn't ready to say what happened. A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said any talk of Russia being involved is ""stupidity."" Putin said Ukraine's military campaign against the separatists was to blame, but he didn't accuse either side for the suspected shoot-down. What evidence do officials have so far? Ukraine's state security chief accused two Russian military intelligence officers of involvement and said they must be punished. Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said he based his allegation on intercepts of phone conversations between the two officers. ""Now you know who carried out this crime. We will do everything for the Russian military who carried out this crime to be punished,"" he told reporters. Philip Mudd, a former senior official for the FBI and CIA, said that after an incident, people start to talk and intelligence agencies, like the U.S. National Security Agency, will pick up on those conversations. How did officials conclude it was a missile attack? The United States came to the conclusion of a missile attack through radar data. A U.S. radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane was shot down, a senior U.S. official told CNN. A second system saw a heat signature -- which would indicate a missile rising from the ground into the air -- at the time the airliner was hit, the official explained. The wreckage path, O'Brien said, will also reveal a lot. If a plane breaks up in midair, which is likely what would happen in a missile strike, there would be a large swath of wreckage, he said, but if it breaks down due to mechanical failure, the debris field would be more concentrated. How long will it take to determine who was responsible? Putin probably knew Thursday what happened, according to Mudd, who said Russia is one of a few countries with the capability to follow missiles. Obama will probably walk into the Oval Office on Friday to find an assessment that gives a pretty clear picture on where the missile was launched. That report will be based on human and technical sources such as radar. Are separatists giving investigators access to crash site? The area where the plane crashed isn't under control of authorities in Kiev. Pro-Russia separatists were in control of the site Thursday night, according to Noah Sneider, a freelance journalist on the scene. Separatists were among the first to the crash site and some of them went through the wreckage. Photos of the crash site show people standing on pieces of the wreckage. ""The mere fact that this is not a secure, sterile site at the moment -- is of concern,"" Quest said. CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson said that it was hours before five government rescue teams were allowed into the crash area and armed groups were getting in the way of their work. Phone calls intercepted by Ukraine authorities indicate some of the debris was being looted and taken away. What role will the United States play? It certainly will get involved on the ground if any of the passengers are Americans. And it likely will send a team from the National Transportation Safety Board because the Boeing 777-200 was built in the United States. NTSB officials said Thursday they are waiting to see how they will be involved, but a senior administration official told CNN a team would go in an advisory capacity. The FBI would also send agents, the official said. There are complications, however, because the area where the plan crashed isn't under control of authorities in Kiev. And U.S. authorities likely wouldn't be able to travel to territory controlled by separatists in eastern Ukraine who have declared themselves independent. U.S. intelligence agencies are analyzing the trajectory of the missile to try to learn where the attack came from. It will also look through satellite images to pinpoint the launch spot. The State Department would assist in diplomatic discussions between Ukraine and Russia. It would also help families of victims, if any of those on board had ties to the United States. CNN's Barbara Starr, Evan Perez, Elise Labott and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Experts: Investigation should not include parties involved in Ukraine conflict .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony, accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008, was determined competent to proceed with her capital murder trial after she was examined by three psychologists over the weekend, the judge said Monday. The psychologists' reports will be sealed, said Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. outside the presence of the jury. ""Based on privileged communications between Casey Marie Anthony and her counsel, counsel reasonably believes that Ms. Anthony is not competent to aid and assist in her own defense and is incompetent to proceed,"" said the motion, filed by defense attorneys Saturday under seal and made public Monday. ""As a result of this well-founded concern, counsel requests a full competency determination before the continuation of trial proceedings."" It was implied -- but not expressly stated -- that the motion was the reason for the abrupt recess Perry called on Saturday morning. Anthony, 25, is charged with seven counts, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading police, in her daughter's death. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against her. Anthony's defense team is trying to discredit the prosecution theory that the Orlando woman rendered Caylee unconscious with chloroform, duct-taped her mouth and nose, and stored the body in her car trunk for a few days before dumping it in the woods. The defense says Caylee accidentally drowned in the family pool and that Anthony and her father, George, panicked and covered it up. George Anthony has denied that theory. Anthony's defense attorneys also filed a motion Monday asking Perry to reconsider an earlier decision and declare Florida's death penalty law unconstitutional. The motion cites a June 20 decision by U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez, which found the method used to reach a death sentence in Florida is improper ""because it does not require a jury to make the findings of fact necessary to impose a death sentence."" Anthony's attorneys had previously filed a motion asking for the statute to be declared unconstitutional, and Perry denied it. After the Martinez decision, they are asking him to reconsider. ""Because Florida's death penalty procedure is unconstitutional, the death penalty should be precluded as a potential sentence,"" according to the motion. In the case Martinez ruled on, Evans v. McNeil, the jury recommended a sentence of death on a 9-3 vote but did not say on which aggravating factors it based the decision. A motion to alter or amend has been filed in the case -- basically a motion asking Martinez to reconsider. Jurors heard Monday from two men who worked for Casey Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, after Caylee's disappearance on June 16, 2008. Private investigators James Hoover and Dominic Casey both said they provided security services at the Anthony home from ""protesters"" who would show up. Hoover said he was working as a citizen although he is a licensed private investigator. The two said they spent two days in November 2008 searching a wooded area for Caylee's body. The search site was near where the remains were found a month later. A videotape of that search was played for jurors. Casey told defense attorney Ann Finnell the search was prompted by a phone tip he received from a psychic. Both defense attorney Jose Baez and prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick accused Hoover of attempting to cash in on his association with the case by trying to sell the tape of the search, but he denied that, saying he actually thought he had taped over the search and only discovered later he had not. He did say he at one point was going to sell some photographs of the search and give the money to Casey and the Anthony family. ""I didn't need it,"" he said. Jurors also heard from Kenneth Furton, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Florida International University and director emeritus of the university's International Forensic Research Institute. Furton testified that he studies chemicals emitted by both live and dead people. Chloroform can be given off in small amounts by a decomposing body. One prosecution expert, Arpad Vass of Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, described the levels of the substance in the trunk of Anthony's white Pontiac Sunfire as ""shockingly high."" Several witnesses also testified for the state about odors that they said smelled like the unmistakable scent of human decomposition. Furton said there are alternative explanations for the chloroform found in the trunk, noting the compound is found in a number of household items, particularly bleach. On his cross-examination, prosecutor Jeff Ashton held up the black spare tire cover from Anthony's trunk. Furton acknowledged that if bleach had been poured directly on the carpet, the cover would have showed some evidence of that. Also, Furton said, the chemical reactions that produce chloroform also produce other substances. Testing was not done to determine whether any of those substances were present, he said -- either by him or by the Oak Ridge laboratory. Furton said there is no instrumentation that can record with scientific validity the presence or absence of human decomposition, and said his studies suggest there are chemical compounds unique to human decomposition that were not present in Vass' analysis of the air samples from the trunk. On cross-examination, however, he acknowledged that a decomposing human body would explain the presence of the compounds that Vass found, but Furton said a bag of garbage that was left in the trunk for weeks could have contributed. Before a lunch break, Furton testified that the Oak Ridge laboratory should have done a quantitative analysis to determine how much chloroform was present in the trunk in order to state its importance. Orange County Sheriff's Office Detective Yuri Melich, the lead investigator in the case, was also recalled to the stand Monday. Baez questioned Melich in an effort to cast doubt on the thoroughness of the investigation. Under questioning, Melich acknowledged that he did not subpoena George Anthony's cell tower records, showing where he was when calls were made or received. Asked whether that might have helped investigators, Melich said it would have, ""if I had had a reason to believe it would play a part in this case, which at the time I did not."" He said he also did not seize a computer belonging to Roy Kronk, the meter reader who discovered Caylee's remains in a wooded area near the Anthony home on December 11, 2008. Melich testified he had no reason to do so. Melich also said that cadaver dogs were not deployed on George and Cindy Anthony's cars, only on Casey Anthony's. On cross-examination, Burdick asked Melich whether anyone ever reported that either of those cars smelled like a dead body, and he said they did not. Monday marks the beginning of the sixth week of testimony in the trial, which began with opening statements on May 24. Perry originally told jurors, who are being housed in an Orlando hotel shielded from media coverage of the trial, that the trial could last six to eight weeks. On Friday -- before Saturday's delay -- Baez said he expected the defense to rest on Wednesday or possibly Thursday. That would leave room for a rebuttal case from the prosecution and closing statements before the Independence Day holiday. Saturday was planned as a full day in the trial, and it was unclear how the day's delay would affect those plans. Testimony on Monday lasted until after 7 p.m. Caylee was not reported missing to police until July 15, 2008, when Cindy Anthony, tracked down her daughter Casey and demanded answers regarding Caylee's whereabouts. Prosecution witnesses described Casey Anthony's behavior in the month after Caylee was last seen as nonchalant, testifying that she spent time with her boyfriend, went shopping and to nightclubs -- but told no one her daughter was missing. They testified they noticed no change in her demeanor. Baez said in his opening statement that Anthony behaved as she did because years of sexual abuse by her father had conditioned her to conceal the truth and hide her pain. George Anthony has denied the claims that he abused his daughter or helped conceal his granddaughter's death. In Session's Grace Wong, Jean Casarez, Jessica Thill and Michael Christian contributed to this report. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"(CNN) -- The world of football has rallied around Jonas Gutierrez as the Argentine fights testicular cancer. A midfielder with Newcastle and Argentina, Gutierrez made the announcement during a television interview earlier this week. The 31-year-old underwent an operation to remove his left testicle last October after the discovery of a tumor. But after an inflammation of the groin was spotted by doctors at the end of last season, he returned to Argentina to undergo chemotherapy. ""When I was told I had cancer, I went home in tears,"" he said in an interview with Argentine television show Indirecto on TyC Sports. ""In May 2013, I felt very tough pains on my testicle. After some wrong diagnosis, an ultrasound detected the tumor. ""I came here and I assumed the costs despite having a contract with Newcastle. ""Money is not important. What is important is my health. I had to start chemotherapy."" Gutierrez recalls the final day of the 2012-13 Premier League season where he first felt pain following a tackle with Bacary Sagna, then of Arsenal. ""I had a very hard collision with Sagna in the area of the pubic bone and the genitals,"" he added. ""From then I had a lot of pain that wouldn't go away. I spoke with the doctor straight after and he said: 'If it doesn't hurt then don't worry.' '""Then it was holiday time and I felt the pain more in the testicle. The season started and in September and October I noticed that the testicle started to become inflamed. I felt a pain when I put my underpants on, it was uncomfortable. ""I went back to the doctor and they told me to have an ultrasound scan and they detected a tumor and told me I needed an operation. I left the clinic crying and went home and told my dad who was there. ""I spoke to the club and said because of the delicate nature of the problem and because in Argentina I was going to understand everything being told to me better, I wanted to be treated there."" Gutierrez, who won 22 caps for Argentina, made his international debut in 2007 and played at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He says that his teammates have been supportive, particularly Fabricio Coloccini, who Gutierrez played with at Newcastle as well as Argentina. ""This is the most difficult match I've every played. You start thinking about important things when you have problems like this one. ""Some guys like (Gabriel) Heinze gave me strength,"" said Gutierrez, referring to the former Argentina defender, who played for a number of Europe's leading clubs, including Real Madrid and Manchester United. Heinze is not the only Argentine footballer to have contacted Gutierrez. ""After surgery, I told (Ezequiel) Lavezzi, (Martin) Demichelis and Coloccini, who is very close to me. We've played together at Newcastle for six years and he calls me. He is almost a member of my family. ""I decided to reveal all this because I think this is a difficult moment, but there is nothing wrong with this. These things may help other people."" Gutierrez, who was on loan at Norwich last season, scored 10 goals in 177 league appearances for the Magpies. He was nicknamed 'Spider-Man' by Newcastle fans after pulling out a mask to celebrate his goals. Gutierrez, who has one-year remaining on his current deal at Newcastle, has one more session of chemotherapy remaining. While he has kept the matter private for some time, it was after receiving an email about an actress who is also battling cancer that he felt compelled to share his story. ""She was showing photographs of when she had hair and when she lost her hair and what she was going through,"" he said of the email. ""i think there is nothing bad in telling your story; it can even help people and encourage them to fight. ""It removes some of the pressure talking about it and I also think it can help a lot of people who are passing through a similar situation to be strong and to fight and to see that these are situations that you can overcome and emerge stronger from."" Gutierrez is not the first football player in the English game to be diagnosed with the illness. Neil Harris, who played for Millwall, Northampton's Matt Duke and former Tottenham defender Jason Cundy all returned to action following successful recoveries. According to figures provided by the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS), testicular cancer usually affects men between the ages of 15 and 49. It accounts for just 1% of cancers suffered by men with more than 96% making a full recovery if it is caught in the early stages.","Jonas Gutierrez has been diagnosed with testicular cancer .

"(CNN) -- Billy Horschel is $11.4m richer after getting the better of world number one Rory McIlroy and fellow American Jim Furyk to win the Tour Championship Sunday and clinch the FedEx Cup. His three-shot victory at East Lake has capped a remarkable three weeks for the 27-year-old, who won the preceding BMW Championship after finishing second in the Deutsche Bank Championship. He benefited from a mid-round collapse by McIlroy, who had started the day with Horschel in the joint lead. A double bogey on the short sixth and three further dropped shots around the turn saw the Northern Irishman fall out of contention before three birdies in the final four holes restored a measure of respectability to his round. Furyk emerged as the main challenger to Horschel, drawing level with him before a 31-foot birdie putt put the eventual champion in a lead he never relinquished. Furyk bogeyed the closing par-three 18th to slip back to a tie for second with McIlroy, but there was no doubt about the winner, who closed with a solid 68 for 11-under 269. ""He deserved it,"" McIlroy said. ""He played the best golf this week."" American Chris Kirk, Justin Rose of England and Australian Jason Day were tied for fourth on seven-under. Horschel's remarkable late season form has lifted him into golfing superstar status, but it has come too late to earn him a place in the United States team for Ryder Cup against Europe later this month. ""It's unbelievable,"" said Horschel, who missed the cut in the first FedEx play-off event before his incredible surge to the top of the standings from 60th at the start of the four tournament mini-series. ""But at the same time I knew my game was in the right shape and I just needed to get out of my own way, allow my golf game to show and it has showed in last three weeks."" His victory in the Tour Championship is worth $1.4m in prize money with a further $10m bonus for the FedEx Cup triumph, relegating Furyk to second place with McIlroy in third. The trio had been among five men to have a chance of the bonus at the start of the week in Atlanta. Horschel is also due for good news off the course as his wife Brittany is expected to give birth to a daughter by the end of the month.","Billy Horschel wins Tour Championship at East Lake .

"(CNN) -- In the absence of any serious Democratic opposition, Hillary Clinton appears to have decided to run against Barack Obama in the 2016 primaries. An interview with Jeffrey Goldberg in the Atlantic revealed her frustrations with the over-caution of the White House. Its maxim ""don't do stupid stuff"" might display post-Bush wisdom, says Clinton, but it also betrays a lack of a plan: ""Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle,"" she said. Clinton would have gone harder into Syria, for example, and armed the democratic opposition early on. The message is that while Obama has somewhat withdrawn America from global war games, she would like it to take a lead. Annie Oakley is back. At the time the interview was conducted, poor Clinton could not have known that events were about to blunt her criticism. (A spokesman for Clinton said Tuesday that Clinton ""called President Obama to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership,"" according to Politico.) Now that U.S. planes are bombing Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, forces in northern Iraq and aid is finally reaching the persecuted religious minorities stranded in the wilderness, Obama's defenders could argue that he's displaying exactly the kind of leadership Clinton accuses him of lacking. Yet, her charge still stands. Consider the wider fate of the Arab world in the past six years. The Arab Spring promised a new era of democracy and better relations with the West. Few of its revolutions worked, many were betrayed by the foreigners who should've been friends. The United States rather arbitrarily decided to help topple Moammar Gadhafi in Libya, resulting in an anarchic situation today that is being exploited by a mix of Islamists and warlords. The administration was less certain of what it wanted in Egypt, vacillating between support for the protesters to support for the army -- and a failed experiment in Islamic democracy gave way to a return of the generals. In Syria, as Clinton suggests, the United States watched as Bashar al-Assad slaughtered the opposition. In Bahrain, it did worse: Arms sales from America rose prior to the regime's brutal crackdown on protesters. And even as Saudi Arabia continues to export its apocalyptic version of fundamentalist Islam, the U.S. government sells it billions of dollars worth of weapons. The greatest failure has surely been in Iraq, because it is the country for which America bears the greatest responsibility. Obama's actions over the weekend are necessary and just. The world cannot tolerate the slaughter of thousands of religious minorities, the collapse of Baghdad or the invasion of the Kurdish homeland. So, well done, Obama, for sending in the planes. But when he was pressed at a press conference on why U.S. troops were not already in Iraq and, by implication, why the United States had stood back as the situation deteriorated, the President economized with the truth. He insisted that it was ""not my decision"" to withdraw troops. Yet he ran for office on quitting Iraq in 2008, then celebrated having done so in 2012, even as -- as Patrick Brennan argues in National Review -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was prepared to negotiate on maintaining a U.S. presence. ""Maliki was willing to accept a deal with U.S. forces if it was worth it to him â€” the problem was that the Obama administration wanted a small force so that it could say it had ended the war,"" he writes. ""Having a very small American force wasn't worth the domestic political price Maliki would have to pay for supporting their presence."" In short, Obama's claim that withdrawal from Iraq was forced upon him is hard to believe. He was elected and re-elected as the anti-Iraq war president (it's why he deserves some credit for having the courage to return to the country today). Clinton is right that Obama has hung back from action. But the very fact that he was elected and then re-elected on a broadly anti-intervention ticket suggests that this is what the people wanted. And therein lies the problem with Clinton's critique. Foreign policy rarely functions separately from the domestic political context: Presidents typically only do what they think they can get away with. There was appetite for military adventures after 9/11; there is little post-Iraq. That's borne out in the polling and by the lack of political support for action in Syria. It's all very well for Clinton to talk of high-mindedness in pre-primary season, but she'll find that does not go down so well in New Hampshire in 2014 and probably won't be popular in the general election or inside the White House. And rightly so. Had the United States involved itself in the Syrian conflict, it would have been picking sides in a brutal civil war with few heroes to choose from. So how does the United States -- undoubtedly a ""great nation"" -- handle foreign crises in an age of doubt? The problem is that no politician, Democrat or Republican, has yet managed to articulate a vision for an America that does believe in things worth fighting for yet which picks its battles with incredible care. Obama's presidency has been too reactive, Clinton is now laying out a plan that sounds a little too proactive. What a pity that so few are saying, ""The U.S. is powerful and, because of that, has a responsibility to support democracy where it can. But we cannot always presume success and history teaches that going it alone comes at a heavy price."" Or, what would be so wrong about pursuing a strategy that asserts that if the United States cannot do much good then it at least will do as little evil as possible -- starting by refusing to provide arms to Arab dictators who torture their own people and export terror? Alas, all too often the only choice American voters are given is between playing the world's policeman or doing nothing at all. Better to be, as John Kennedy described himself, ""an idealist without illusions.""","Timothy Stanley: Hillary Clinton criticized Obama on foreign policy in magazine interview .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- The last thing Thomas Hudner said to mortally wounded pilot Jesse Brown was that he would come back for him. Sixty-three years later, he may just keep that promise. Hudner, who received the Medal of Honor for trying to pull Brown from his downed plane during the Korean War, will fly to Pyongyang on Saturday and is hoping to return to the area his comrade crashed. He will travel with a fellow veteran, historians and his biographer to search for any trace of his friend's remains or the aircraft. CNN is among three news agencies invited for the trip. On December 4, 1950, Hudner, now 88, was part of a six-plane formation providing air support for U.S. Marines on the ground fighting Chinese troops during the Korean War. He was wingman to Ensign Jesse Brown, the first African-American aviator in the U.S. Navy. Korean War: Fast Facts . Both men were in their early 20s but lived a world apart. Hudner was the white son of a successful grocery store owner in Massachusetts, while Brown's father was a Mississippi sharecropper. Brown's F4U Corsair was damaged while flying near the Jangjin Reservoir, known as the Chosin Reservoir by Americans, in the northeast of North Korea. He crash landed on the rough snow-covered terrain. Hudner refused to leave him. He crashed his own plane close by with the intention of pulling Brown from the wreckage. But Brown's legs were trapped and Hudner was unable to free him. When a Marine helicopter landed to stage a rescue, Hudner had to make the agonizing decision to leave Brown. ""The Marine pilot pulled me aside,"" Hudner told CNN, ""and said dusk was approaching and he couldn't fly the helicopter in the dark and the mountainous terrain, so he had to leave. But he said I had the option of going with him or to stay with Jesse, which would have been obvious suicide."" Brown had crashed well behind enemy lines. If the Chinese troops didn't claim Hudner, the Korean winter would. ""I told Jesse that we had to get some more equipment because we couldn't get him out with what we had... I don't know if he even heard m. I'm afraid by this time he had passed."" The U.S. military decided to drop napalm on the wreckage so that Brown's body and the aircraft would not fall into enemy hands. In a rare show of cooperation with a country it often calls the imperialistic enemy, North Korea has given permission for Hudner to return to Chosin Reservoir. The Korean War broke out in June 1950 when communist North Korea attacked its southern neighbor. United Nations forces, made up primarily of U.S. personnel, fought on the side of South Korea. China fought with North Korea. Choisin Reservoir was the scene of a harrowing battle waged during the brutal Korean winter, with frostbite a common injury. Arms and medical supplies also froze in subzero temperatures. Of the 15,000 U.S. troops involved, more than 3,000 died during the 17-day struggle. But the Chinese forces paid a much greater price trying to force the allied troops from their positions -- some 60,000 replacements were required to replace men lost to firepower and cold. An estimated 35,000 Chinese troops lost their lives. Hudner told CNN he didn't think the trip would ever happen. ""We're very grateful to him (leader Kim Jong Un) and to the North Korean government that after all these years we've been given permission to look for Jesse's airplane,"" he said. He puts the chances of finding Brown's remains or his aircraft at 50-50, but says it is important. He said severely strained US-North Korean relations could get a boost. ""Of course, that olive branch has to be extended and accepted by both sides,"" said Hudner. ""There's an important factor that not many people talk about, but in World War II the Japanese and the Germans were our bitter enemies and now they're some of our closest friends."" An armistice agreement was signed on July 27, 1953, but a peace treaty has never been signed, meaning the two Koreas still are technically at war. The 60th anniversary of the end of the war is just one week away and Pyongyang has planned a military parade and mass celebrations on what it calls ""Victory Day."" The group is not planning on attending the commemoration. The timing of the invitation to the U.S. veterans is likely intentional, but for Hudner, the focus is bringing closure to his Korean War experiences and to Brown's family. Brown's widow and daughter, who was just a toddler when he died, are hopeful he will be found and eventually brought back home. Almost 8,000 American military personnel are still missing in action in the conflict.

"(CNN) -- Spain are an unstoppable force in European football. Sevilla beat Benfica in a penalty shootout to win the Europa League Wednesday with La Liga rivals Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid guaranteed to claim the Champions League crown. As an hors d'oeuvre to the mouthwatering final on 24 May, the Europa League provided plenty of drama. Sevilla edged out their Portuguese rivals 4-2 on penalties after a tense 120 minutes of play at the Juventus Stadium in Turin. The Spanish side joined an elite group of teams to have lifted the European trophy three times following their UEFA Cup wins in 2006 and 2007. Benfica have now lost eight European finals -- and the club's peculiar curse continues. After winning the European Cup for a second time in 1962, then manager Bela Guttman was denied a pay rise and promptly declared the club would not succeed on the continent for 100 years. The so-called hex struck again as Benfica tried to lay their ghosts to rest on Italian soil. Jorge Jesus' side had not lost a match on their way to Wednesday's Europa League final while Sevilla had scored 22 goals on their rockier road to the showdown. Despite this goal-scoring prowess, football's first European silverware of the season was decided on penalties after a goalless 90 minutes. Sevilla's lively forward Carlos Bacca and Jose Antonio Reyes had a thrilling series of chances repelled. At the opposite end, Brazilians Lima and Rodrigo forged a potent twin threat for Benefica. Lima forced a fingertip save from Beto when he sent a fizzing long range effort in the Sevilla keeper's direction but the Spaniard's defense held firm -- and the match went into extra time. With another 30 minutes added to the clock, Lima and Bacca once again had the best of the chances. Bacca was put through on goal with a sensational pass from Sevilla captain Ivan Rakitic but the Colombian flicked his left-footed shot wide. It was the last real chance either side had to win the match in regulation play. Lima and Bacca may have struggled to find the back of the net in the final's early stages but both scored as the penalties began in front of the roaring Sevilla fans. Benfica substitute Oscar Cardozo was the first to lose his cool. The experienced forward's hesitant shot was easily collected by Beto. The curse struck again as Rodrigo's stuttering shot was saved. Sevilla's Stephane Mbia,Coke and Spanish international Kevin Gameiro all scored from the spot to see the European trophy join them on the flight back to Spain. Benfica now turn their attention to the Portuguese Cup final where the league champions hope to secure a domestic treble safe in the knowledge that at least on home soil the hex cannot strike again.","Sevilla defeat Benfica 4-2 on penalties to win the Europa League in Turin .

"(CNN) -- It's a good day for Real Madrid. Not only has the 10-time European champion signed World Cup-winning star Toni Kroos, it's also been named the most valuable sports team on the planet. Kroos, who starred during Germany's triumph in Brazil which culminated in a 1-0 win over Argentina in Sunday's final, penned a six-year deal Thursday after his transfer from Bayern Munich was completed in a reported $34 million deal. Business magazine Forbes values Real at $3.4 billion, more than archrivals Barcelona and English giants Manchester United. It suggests ""Los Blancos"" earned $78 million for its victorious European Champions League campaign -- Real beat city rival Atletico Madrid in the final -- contributing to an unrivaled total revenue of $675 million. Barca, which recently completed the signing of Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez for a reported $128 million, is valued at $3.2 billion, while 20-time English champion United is worth $2.81 billion.

"(CNN) -- Alfred Hitchcock, one of the most famous film directors in the world, has re-emerged into the zeitgeist this year. In August, Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" displaced ""Citizen Kane"" from its perch at the top of the prestigious Sight & Sound list of the greatest films ever made. There also had been renewed interest in ""Psycho"" on its 50th anniversary two years ago as well as the release of shiny new Blu-ray packages of his films. But not all the attention has been flattering. In September, HBO's film ""The Girl"" dramatized Tippi Hedren's behind-the-scenes horror stories from the making of ""The Birds"" (1963). According to the movie, Hitchcock was obsessed with his protege and sexually abusive. And now comes ""Hitchcock,"" an Oscar wannabe scripted by John J. McLauglin (""Black Swan"") and directed by Sacha Gervasi (""Anvil""), with Anthony Hopkins as the portly English master of suspense and Scarlett Johansson (very good) as ""Psycho"" star Janet Leigh. (By the way, Hitch never won an Academy Award -- until the academy sheepishly coughed up a lifetime achievement consolation prize.) The movie begins, not unpromisingly, with Ed Gein murdering his older brother and Hitchcock stepping in to the frame to deliver one of his mordantly witty teasers. It's a cute joke, but it soon turns sour in facile scenes featuring the tormented and delusional Hitch confiding to an imaginary Gein, presented here as a soul mate, confessor and psychiatrist all rolled into one. It's a terrible idea, and all the more insidious because of the casting: Hopkins' most famous role remains Hannibal Lecter, and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was influenced by Gein's macabre penchant for taxidermy. Certainly, one of the things that makes ""Psycho"" such a great film is that it takes this monstrous, deviant figure, Norman Bates, and forges a human connection, a slender cord of attraction and empathy between him and Leigh's character, Marion Crane. For all his eccentricity, Anthony Perkins plays Norman as a sensitive, vulnerable, even kindly soul, at the mercy of compulsions he does not comprehend or control. Hitchcock, through his art, humanized a monster. ""Hitchcock,"" on the other hand, chooses to demonize the artist, finding something suspect and distasteful in his pursuit of the Gein story -- itself turned into a kind of obsession -- even as it plays the studio head's dismay for self-congratulatory laughs and cannibalizes Hollywood history. In the most ludicrous scene, the director loses all self-control while wielding a prop knife in the vicinity of a naked Leigh (no matter that the famous shower scene employed a body double). While Hopkins' fearful, arrogant, rather pathetic Hitchcock seizes on ""Psycho"" to persuade himself he's not over the hill (after all, in the previous five years he only had ""Rear Window,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""North by Northwest"" and ""The Wrong Man"" and a couple more masterpieces to his name), his long-suffering wife, Alma Reville (Helen Mirren), watches from the sidelines as he mortgages their home, flirts with Leigh -- his latest blonde -- and pushes back the standards of taste and decency in American cultural life. Alma is indulgent, but only up to a point. She permits herself to embark on a collaboration with a gallant writer friend (Danny Huston), a gesture of artistic independence that Hitch perceives as infidelity, tantamount to adultery. Mirren's pursed, patient, discreet Alma is the real hero of this story.

There is probably some sliver of truth to this, but ""Hitchcock"" plays so fast and loose with the facts it's highly unreliable.

What's worse, this mild, mediocre act of feminist revisionism seems oblivious to the very real, enduring and profound power of ""Psycho,"" which is so much more than just an effective scare machine. If you really want to see an honest movie about Hitchcock's troubled, fetishistic, conflicted, love-hate relationship with women, see ""Psycho,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""Marnie"" or ""Notorious"" -- it's a film he made over and over again his whole life, and better than anyone else ever will.","Anthony Hopkins stars as the famous director Alfred Hitchcock .

"New York (CNN) -- The first time Chris shot up heroin, he was too scared to do it himself. So his friend did it for him -- when he was 16. ""I would shoot up mostly in my feet,"" he said. ""It escalated to almost five or six bags every time I shot up."" He spent hundreds of dollars a day feeding his addiction. ""I was stealing money from my parents, I was doing illegal actions with my friends, I broke into houses, I've done all of the above besides selling myself."" Chris, now 17, is in treatment at Outreach House, a long-term substance abuse program on Long Island, New York, for youths ages 12 to 17. His road to recovery hasn't been a smooth ride, however. After three failed attempts at outpatient treatment, Chris entered an in-patient program at Outreach, but he ran away five times in the first few months. That is not uncommon, said John Venza, vice president of adolescent services at Outreach. ""It really requires an extended amount of time,"" he said. 4 arrested, 350 bags of suspected heroin seized in Hoffman case . For Chris and the others at Outreach, treatment means removing any distractions to recovery. There are no cell phones, personal televisions or computers allowed, except for doing homework. Teens in the program have mandatory jobs, like service crew, and can work their way up to leadership positions among their peers. There's a primary focus on youths taking responsibility for their own behavior. Chris' parents said that in short-term treatment programs, he made new connections with other users that caused him to relapse when he got out. ""We're able to have them here for a longer window, where we're really able to shift the values,"" Venza said. ""We do very intense work with the families. So we help shift the family's support system."" From heroin addict to PTA mom . Heroin use has exploded in what is being described as an epidemic on New York's Long Island, where addiction counselors are seeing users as young as 12 -- many from middle-class, suburban families. Several factors have contributed to this ""perfect storm"" of addiction according to experts -- among them, proximity to major airports and transportation centers, and a statewide crackdown on prescription painkillers, that has had the unintended effect of pushing more kids to cheaper and more accessible heroin. The trend appears to be national. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says U.S. drug poisoning deaths involving heroin went up 45% from 2006 to 2010. And the Drug Enforcement Administration says the amount of heroin seized each year at the southwest U.S. border increased 232% from 2008 to 2012. And the trend is bad for younger users. Among four age groups, ""drug poisoning deaths involving heroin"" increased only for the youngest group, ages 15 to 24, from 2008 to 2010. For all the other age groups, the number of deaths was steady or went down, the CDC says. In Long Island, it's gotten so bad that one official dubbed the Long Island Expressway, which runs east across the island from New York City, the ""Heroin Highway."" Jeff Reynolds, executive director of the Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, said the death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman puts a national spotlight on drug abuse. But he fears the attention won't last. Are heroin death probes created equal? ""What will happen, and what we're seeing now, is some attention on the overdose, attention on treatment and recovery. And then, in a few days, we'll go back to life as it was,"" he said. Hoffman ""was one of an estimated 100 people yesterday who lost their lives through a fatal overdose,"" Reynolds said Monday. ""We probably could have prevented most of those overdoses, through prevention, access to treatment, recovery support. Yet we didn't. So each one is an indictment of what we failed to do. But it also should energize us to say we need to get serious about this disease."" And Reynolds sees another disturbing trend: ""Ten years ago, if you used two to three bags of heroin a day, you were considered a chronic heavy user. For kids these days, that's breakfast."" How heroin kills you . A deadly one. Heroin has killed a record number of people on Long Island in the last two years, data shows. Heroin arrests on Long Island by the DEA are up 163% in just the last year. Reynolds says he's seen a seven-fold increase in patients in the past five years -- 80% of them from heroin and other opiates. Users often don't fit the stereotype of the heroin addict. Many are cheerleaders, athletes and straight-A students from loving homes. ""You couldn't have looked at my daughter and said she was a heroin addict,"" said Susan Roethel, whose daughter, Megan, died of an overdose at 22. ""The girl was beautiful. She was blond like the rest of these kids -- absolutely beautiful and you didn't know it. (Heroin) was all over."" Doc: My state in addiction stranglehold . Parents are caught between denial and shame over the stigma of having a heroin-addicted child. Chris' mother, Joanne, said she was shocked to learn her son was using the drug. ""Heroin? My son? Never. How did I not see that?"" Dorothy Johnson, who lost her son Maxwell at age 28, says stigma is keeping families from seeking help. ""Our children are just like every other mother or father's child and they're not junkies. And that term needs to change."" Getting an addicted child into treatment is difficult, and insurance won't always pay. Roethel said short-term programs also did not help her daughter. ""There have to be long-term recovery programs,"" she said. ""Well over a year. I think it's very difficult for these kids to come back."" Robert Scarabino, whose 24-year-old daughter, Jaclyn, died of an overdose in her own bed, said in short-term rehab, ""You work the best of the best. They all know how to conceal, contrive, steal, get more money to support the habit."" Chris says he believes his 11 months at Outreach saved his life. ""I put myself in so many circumstances where I could have died,"" he says. ""Being able to say that I have different ways that I can manage my emotions besides getting high, it makes me very happy and excited to go through my future."" He'll begin that future next week, when he graduates from Outreach, moves back home with his parents and faces the challenge of staying sober. His mother, Joanne, says the program not only saved her son, ""It saved us, too.""

"(CNN) -- If you have been an Apple stockholder last year, you probably feel like you have been on a roller coaster. Apple began 2012 by attaining the largest market cap in the world, with some analysts predicting that it would cross a trillion in market value. The stock price hit $700 in September, around the introduction of the iPhone 5. But in the weeks after, disillusionment set in and the stock price dropped to about $500 by the end of the year. Recent earnings disappointment has plunged the stock some 12%, and panic seems to have set in. How can a company fall from grace so quickly, especially when it still possesses enviable profit margins and perhaps the most valuable franchise in the world? The answer lies in recognizing that a market price is set by demand and supply, which, in turn, are driven not only by underlying value but also by other factors including hope, hype and momentum. Apple is particularly susceptible to these ""nonvalue"" forces. Apple has acquired a motley collection of investors, with wildly divergent views about the company and its future. There are growth investors, who were attracted by its capacity to come up with new products and conquer new markets. There are momentum investors, who were drawn by the ever-rising stock price (at least a year ago). And there are value investors, who were enticed by its capacity to generate and pay out large cash flows. The ubiquitous presence of Apple products has made each of these types of investors an expert on the company's future. Thus, investors who would not have dared forecast the futures of GE and Exxon Mobil -- when they were the largest market cap companies in the world -- feel no qualms about prognosticating Apple's future. You may wonder: So what? When a stock becomes a pricing play, investors no longer pay attention to underlying value and instead focus on trivial stories, such as the lack of crowds at the Shanghai store for the introduction of the iPhone 5. Investors react in exaggerated (and herd-like) fashion to small, often insignificant surprises. Given that you and I as investors can do little about the crowd insanity that characterizes Apple's stock today, what should we do? You can try to play the pricing game and get ahead of momentum shifts, a dangerous game that I, for one, have neither the stomach nor the expertise to play. Alternatively, you can look past the price at Apple's underlying value, based on its capacity to generate growth and margins over time. At the end of last year, I estimated a value of roughly $609 per share for the company. While this valuation predates the most recent earnings report, I see little reason to revisit it, since the revenue growth and margins that Apple reported are actually in line with what I had used in my valuation. If you do decide to buy Apple's stock, as I did last week, remember that the pricing game has its own internal dynamics that may cause the price to move further away from value, before there is a correction. So, it is entirely possible that your ""value play"" in Apple could yield disappointments in the near term. To be successful, you have to be able to hold the stock through these disappointments and to stop listening to equity research analysts and Apple experts in the meantime. As for the company, it is time for a reboot. I feel sympathy for CEO Tim Cook, who has big shoes to fill. But there are three things that Apple can do to put itself back on even keel. First, the company has to regain credibility with investors, both in terms of guidance that it provides on upcoming earnings and the information it makes available about its product plans. Apple has acquired a reputation for lowballing its expected results before earnings reports. Instead of making it easier for the company to beat expectations, it has led instead to markets paying little heed to the guidance. Also, Apple's secrecy about new products and strategies might be a great marketing strategy, but it creates an information vacuum, which is filled with rumors and fantasy. Second, the company has to stop trying to be all things to all investors and make its stand on whether it sees itself more as a growth company or a more mature company. By making the choice to be a mature company, Apple is not forsaking growth, but it is signaling that its emphasis will be on protecting the profitability of its current franchises first before seeking out new growth opportunities. By doing so, it may be able to create a more homogeneous investor base that is less likely to be at war with itself. Third, once Apple makes its stand as a growth or mature company, it has to behave consistently. So if it decides that it is a mature company, it should return more cash to its stockholders. The tax code is tilted toward debt, and a company that can afford to borrow money that does not is not using that tax benefit. So perhaps in the future, the company should think about using a little debt to fund itself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aswath Damodaran.","Despite record quarterly profit, Apple's stock price plunged 12% recently .

"(CNN) -- How do you replace the adrenaline-filled emotion of scoring one of the greatest goals in World Cup history when your football career ends? If you're Michael Owen, you start a multimillion-dollar horse racing business. It's 16 years since a teenage Owen slalomed his way through the Argentina defense to announce himself as England's brightest superstar at France '98. Now he is cantering to success with his own horse stables -- not that it comes close to emulating the feeling of a sweetly struck goal. ""The surge of emotion and adrenaline of scoring a goal can never be matched, no matter what you do,"" Owen told CNN's Winning Post show. ""This is a weird type of feeling. It's a feeling of emptiness when you say cheerio to the horse and jockey down at the start and you've just got no control over anything."" As a striker, even if you are part of an 11-man team, your fate is very much in your own hands -- or rather feet -- and you're judged by the number of goals you score. But as a racehorse owner, Owen's success or failure is governed by a whole new range of emotions. ""With football you always feel in control. On the pitch, you can always do something to make something happen. Your destiny is in your hands in many ways,"" he says. ""But with racing there's none of that. It's just a real emptiness."" Except when your horse passes the winning post. ""You're just sitting there hoping ... but when one of your horses crosses the line in front it's a great feeling and a great adrenaline rush. Not quite that of scoring a goal, but it comes close."" Owen retired from football in March 2013 following an illustrious career in which he played for several of Europe's top clubs and scored 40 goals in 89 international appearances for England. After starting his career at Liverpool, where he scored 158 goals in 297 games, Owen went on to play for Real Madrid, Newcastle, Manchester United and Stoke City. Named European Footballer of the Year in 2001, his pace and predatory instincts made him one of the most prolific strikers in the game before a succession of injuries took their toll. But horse racing always provided a much-needed escape from the pressure of playing at the highest level of the game, having been introduced to the ""sport of kings"" by his father Terry. Owen set up Manor House Stables in May 2007 with trainer Tom Dascombe and businessman Andrew Black. Situated between Liverpool and Manchester in northwest England, the 170-acre operation houses 90 horses co-owned by up to 250 investors. While the pace may have gone from his own legs, Owen's horses continue to prosper, with 81 winners last season and over 60 this time around. As an elite footballer he was very well paid, but he is very conscious that his stables are well run financially even if it is a hobby. ""It's a business that takes a lot of money to run,"" he says. ""You don't want to continue to not be in profit or at least break even, so the business is in a healthy position now. ""I don't want to have to plow money into it every year, which is why it's important that it's run correctly. ""Aside from that, it's purely a hobby and if it gives me a lot of enjoyment then that's exactly what it was built to be."" Owen remains connected to football, working as a media pundit for broadcasters such as BT Sport -- which is threatening to break Sky Sports' dominance of UK coverage after landing big-money deals for the Premier League and UEFA Champions League. His love for the game can be seen in an advert he did for BT Sport in a sketch where he sneaks into a recording booth to excitedly commentate on his greatest goals. ""My real business and my real passion and my real purpose for getting up is still in football,"" Owen says. ""I look after a lot of young talented players in this country and I do a lot of television work and everything else connected with the game, so that's where my main passion lies."" Owen is not alone when it comes to a love of football and horses -- trainer Mick Channon played for Southampton and Manchester City as well as England. Then there is Owen's former manager at Manchester United, Alex Ferguson, who has an interest in a number of horses, which means he is often seen on racecourses around the country. Wayne Rooney, who recently signed a $500,000 a week deal with Manchester United, also has his own horse -- Switcharooney. ""Wayne and his wife Colleen own two horses with us,"" Owen says. ""His family love it as well -- his father and his granddad, they're often down here, so there are a few footballers here."" The likes of Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes all part-own horses too, according to their former United teammate. ""A lot of footballers enjoy it,"" he adds. ""The likes of Paul Scoles, John O'Shea, he's a big racing fan, and Joey Barton likes his racing. ""A lot of the others have just bought it for a day out or whatever, but some of them are really keen."" Owen's own horse, Brown Panther, has enjoyed success in England and finished eighth at Australia's Melbourne Cup in November 2013. He shot to fame in 2011 by winning the King George V Stakes at Ascot -- a result which left Owen with tears of joy streaming down his face. While he does not profess to be a trainer, and is happy to leave such work to his 40-strong stables staff, Owen does believe his experience of playing elite sport can be translated into the horse world. ""The training of a racehorse is very similar to that of an athlete,"" he says. ""We're all mammals at the end of the day, we require the same things to make us go fast and recover. ""We all get stiff after work so there are a lot of things that football could teach racing and vice-versa."" As his playing fortunes dwindled, Owen's popularity dipped markedly at the end of his career and he was regularly targeted on social media with unrelenting abuse. With injuries curtailing his time on the pitch, he would more often be seen on the turf next to his horses than at football stadiums. It led to the accusation that he was no longer interested in football and simply picking up the wages to fund his new venture -- something he strenuously denies. ""You live in a world as a footballer where people are quick to criticize or quick to question you,"" Owen says. ""But those same people that said, 'Oh you're taking your eye off the ball, setting up a business,' they don't realize that when you finish football you're finished and you've got nothing."" Plenty of footballers have suffered from depression or squandered their considerable earnings, but Owen was determined not to fall into that category. ""I've got a young family, so I've prepared for life after football,"" he says.","Michael Owen has moved from professional football to horse racing .

"(CNN) -- We who work to promote human rights operate in the realm of treaties, rule of law, and state responsibility. These are benchmarks of accountability that presume our world civilization has moved well beyond the horrors of the past: From the Biblical destruction of the Amalekites through Genghis Khan and the Crusades to the gas warfare of World War I. Such atrocities may have continued well into the 20th century with the Nazi Holocaust and Khmer Rouge, but the Nuremberg trials, the development of international humanitarian law and human rights conventions, and the establishment of international criminal courts signaled that justice for the worst crimes was possible. So we are dumbstruck when we confront the blatant and self-advertised brutality occurring in the parts of Iraq and Syria that have fallen under the control of the so-called Islamic State. There, the members of this group make no effort to hide their atrocities or even to make them look less atrocious. To the contrary, they advertise it and appear to relish their primitivism, showing a degree of sophistication only in their use of video technology and social media to document and disseminate evidence of their crimes. One of the key tools of the human rights trade is ""naming and shaming,"" by which we seek to expose wrongdoers to the opprobrium their crimes deserve, and ensure accountability. We have better and more fine-tuned instruments at our disposal now than ever before to investigate and document rights abuses, as well as more comprehensive legal mechanisms for holding accountable those who commit crimes against humanity and other serious violations. But what if those wrongdoers know no shame? What if they are proud of their deeds, seeing them in some manner as an expression of God's will and not beholden to human law, even law that is universal in scope and application? The fundamental challenge to our understanding of human rights abuse and how to counter such abuses is exemplified in the handful of accounts of Yezidis who survived the massacre in northern Iraq. From his hospital bed in Dohuk, one survivor with bullet wounds in his legs and pelvis recounted, ""First they wanted us all to convert to Islam and we said yes just to save our lives."" Then, he said, ""They started shooting at us randomly."" He estimated that Islamic State militants massacred about 80 men and kidnapped the women and girls. The mind-set of the attackers seems to have been to eradicate the Yezidis' most fundamental thoughts -- their religious beliefs -- and doubting the genuineness of their forced conversion, to eliminate them. As human rights activists, we feel despair at the extraordinary savagery of ISIS -- not just against executed journalist James Foley, but against hundreds of thousands of Shia, ethnic and religious minorities, and other Iraqi and Syrian civilians. We are humbled by the challenge of restoring humanity to the conflicts that roil so much of the Mideast. We recognize that our work, whether it be laying the groundwork for future indictments or seeking secure and dignified asylum for the displaced, in the short term at least, will be limited. We realize that only political action at the highest levels has the capacity to prevent mass killings. Precisely because of the extreme brutality and the deep political, cultural, and sectarian polarization, the universal values of human rights have never been so important. And even if the perpetrators are beyond shaming, the moral imperative to name names has never been greater.","Bill Frelick: Human rights workers operate amid laws that keep wrongdoers accountable .

Bourdain met the couple this summer while filming an upcoming episode of CNN's ""Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown."" ""They were so positive about their country.

"(CNN) -- Police have arrested a couple and charged them with kidnapping in the apparent abduction of two Amish girls in upstate New York this week, authorities said late Friday. Stephen M. Howells II, 39, and his girlfriend Nicole F. Vaisey, 25, are being held without bond, according to the St. Lawrence County Sheriff's Office. Federal charges are also a possibility. On Wednesday, an Amber Alert was issued after 6-year-old Delila Miller and her 12-year-old sister, Fannie, disappeared from a vegetable stand near their family farm in Oswegatchie, located about 50 miles from the Canadian border. A witness told police the girls were tending to a customer who drove up in a white 4-door sedan and then disappeared when the vehicle pulled away, according to the Amber Alert. The Amber Alert was canceled Thursday night after Delila and Fannie were apparently abandoned along a road in Richville, about 40 miles away. ""The children walked up to a home, knocked on the door of a stranger,"" St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain told CNN affiliate WWNY. ""The stranger brought them home to their house and police were waiting."" She said the girls were ""a little wet and cold,"" but otherwise healthy. The investigation moved quickly on Friday, as ""good police work"" and tips from the girls led authorities to the suspects, said St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells.

"(CNN) -- Monday is International Transgender Day of Visibility, and the day I have chosen to ""come out"" as transgender. We are all assigned a gender at birth. Sometimes that assignment doesn't match our inner truth, and there needs to be a new place -- a place for self-identification. I was not born a boy, I was assigned boy at birth. Understanding the difference between the two is crucial to our culture and society moving forward in in the way we treat -- and talk about -- transgender individuals. One of my earliest memories is from 5 years old. I used to drape T-shirts on my head, and would delight in feeling the fabric on my back. My mom asked me, ""why do you always wear a T-shirt on your head?"" I responded, ""It's not a T-shirt, Mom -- this is my hair."" Growing up the Philippines, I was involved in transgender beauty pageants from the age of 15. In Asian cultures, the fluidity of gender has been part of life for thousands of years, evidenced by the Buddhist Goddess of compassion, GuanYin and the Hindu hijra Goddess, Bahuchara Mata, who is sacred to men who want to be cured of impotence, and to women wanting to become pregnant. Yet despite this nuanced understanding, and despite the pageant culture I grew up in, in many countries, fluidity is celebrated but not politically recognized. A personal turning point came in 2005, a year before I became a U.S. citizen, when I was traveling through Tokyo. Back then, I still had my Philippines passport and my former male gender marker, but I presented as a woman. I was taken into the immigration office at the airport and questioned for hours about my identity. I have friends in the Philippines -- where there is no law that allows them to change their name and marker -- that have these experiences every time they travel. It's dehumanizing. When I first moved to the United States to work as a model, and I finally had the opportunity to change my name and gender marker, I felt as though my outside self finally matched my inner truth. I really felt like I'd made it but, over time, I realized that there's a lot of work that needs to be done and that I was only just beginning. Today I am launching Gender Proud, which envisions a world where transgender individuals are able to self-identify with the fewest possible barriers. In most of the Western world, conceptions of gender remain very rigid, but that exists alongside progressive legal systems that afford transgender individuals some limited rights. There are varying differences of understanding between Eastern and Western cultures, and I hope Gender Proud can create a new understanding. We are partnering with All Out to identify countries where legislation is at a ""tipping point,"" and we plan to funnel resources to on-the-ground activists and organizations working to create change. There's a long history of people within the community who stood up and fought for justice. I was inspired by the trailblazers, such as Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera and by organizations, including the Association of Transgender in the Philippines, Transgender Europe, Global Action for Trans Equality, among others. I believe that a more mature and in-depth contemplation of the subject of transgender will be the bridge that leads humanity to a deeper understanding of gender as a whole. This deeper understanding begins with the realization that we live in a culture that assigned us gender at birth and that the appropriate roles and expectations of our gender are defined by our society and our culture. In today's globally connected and ever-diversifying world, culture is now more fluid and more flexible than ever -- and so too should be our understanding and perception of gender.

"(CNN) -- Are Taylor Swift and country music never, ever, ever getting back together? Swift released a video Monday for her new single, ""Shake It Off,"" and the song is decidedly more pop than fans are used to from the country singer. It's all in keeping with her fifth studio album, ""1989,"" which Swift announced during a Yahoo livestream. The new album's title is a nod to the year Swift was born and is being hyped as the star's ""first documented official pop album."" Swift sports multiple personas in the music video, including one that is reminiscent of Lady Gaga. The song is an ode to the ""haters"" that Swift is shaking off -- and, of course, there is the dancing. ""All I think about are metaphors and cats,"" Swift said in the livestream. ""Life itself and who people actually are can be greatly reflected in how people dance. ... I don't mean how good you are but your willingness to dance."" Writing for USA Today, Brian Mansfield said Swift's message seems to be ""Hate me all you want ... but you're missing all the fun."" ""Lyrically, 'Shake It Off' is 'Mean 2.0,' with the 24-year-old singer/songwriter taking all the criticisms leveled at her and dismissing them flippantly,"" Mansfield writes. ""It's a total swerve musically, however, with horn-blast grooves grounded in early '60s proto-soul and girl-group pop, plus a spoken-word breakdown that would come off as awkward if it weren't so knowingly funny."" Twitter immediately embraced the tune, including some high-profile fans. Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted, ""Don't mess with @TaylorSwift13, or she will write an incredibly catchy song about you."" Singer Kelly Clarkson wrote, ""Okay Taylor Swift's new song/video ""Shake it off"" is pretty much my favorite thing right now! She's hilarious! Nicely done #thissickbeat :)"" But not everyone loved the video. It inspired some accusations of racism on Twitter. ""A number of Twitter users, including rapper Earl Sweatshirt, have accused Swift of perpetuating black stereotypes,"" Cleveland.com writer Troy L. Smith reported. ""Many have pointed out that while all of the graceful ballerinas in the video appear to be white, most of the twerking close-ups feature black dancers (there are white women twerking as well).""

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House defended the Secret Service and its director Tuesday amid an embarrassing investigation into whether several agents brought prostitutes back to their hotel in Colombia ahead of a presidential visit. Eleven Secret Service members have been implicated in the investigation, which began Thursday after one of the women complained that she hadn't been paid. In addition, as many as 10 U.S. military personnel from all branches of the armed forces are being questioned about potential involvement in any misconduct, two military officials told CNN. The Americans were in Cartagena to prepare for President Barack Obama's weekend visit to the Summit of the Americas, and Obama has said he expects a ""rigorous"" investigation. The investigation is being led by Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, who has been briefing members of Congress. A leading senator said Tuesday she had been told as many as 21 women had been involved, and questioned whether the incident could have endangered the president. ""Who were these women? Could they have been members of groups hostile to the United States? Could they have planted bugs, disabled weapons, or in any other (ways) jeopardized security of the president or our country?"" asked Maine's Susan Collins, the ranking Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. At the White House, presidential spokesman Jay Carney said Obama ""has confidence"" in Sullivan, who he said ""acted quickly in response to this incident,"" and in the agents around him. ""The work the Secret Service does, the men and women who protect him and his family and those who work with him, is exemplary as a rule,"" Carney said. ""They put their lives on the line, and it is a very difficult job, and he acknowledges that and he appreciates it."" Collins said she believed Sullivan ""will fully investigate"" the allegations and take ""appropriate action"" if the allegations bear out. But she questioned whether there was any similar misconduct on previous missions, and whether the issue is a sign of a deeper problem within the agency. The Secret Service agents and officers involved range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20-year veterans, and all have been interviewed at least once, two government officials with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Monday. Their security clearances have been pulled while the investigation is under way and could be reinstated if they are cleared, the officials said. The agents were offered an opportunity to take a polygraph test, according to a U.S. official. Some of the agents and military personnel maintain they didn't know the women were prostitutes, the official told CNN. ""Even if they weren't (prostitutes), it was totally wrong to take a foreign national back to a hotel when the president is about to arrive,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said he thinks the agents should take the polygraph tests, if they haven't already done so. ""For these individuals, if they want to have any career at all, they have to decide on telling the entire truth and seeing whether they have something going forward."" Issa said his level of confidence in Sullivan is ""high."" The Homeland Security Committee's chairman, Connecticut independent Joe Lieberman, said his staff is looking into the accusations and he may call hearings on the matter. ""History, unfortunately, is full of cases where people in positions of great responsibility, including security, have been compromised by, well, enemies or spies,"" Lieberman said. ""I'm not saying that happened here, but once you conduct yourself in this way, you open that risk."" California Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who leads the chamber's intelligence committee, said she was ""profoundly disappointed"" by the allegations. ""I've always respected the Secret Service as kind of numero uno of our law enforcement community,"" she said. U.S. government sources have said there was a dispute between at least one Secret Service member and a woman demanding payment. At least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police, and complaints were filed with the U.S. Embassy, the sources said. While soliciting prostitution is legal in certain areas of Colombia, it is considered a breach of the agency's conduct code, the government sources said. Military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, displaying conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct ""prejudicial to good order and discipline."" The military personnel involved were sent to Colombia to support the Secret Service. A military official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the ongoing investigation told CNN that two of those being questioned are Marines who handle military working dogs. Air Force and Navy personnel, some of whom are believed to be explosive disposal experts, also are being questioned, the official said. The alleged misconduct occurred before Obama arrived in Cartagena, and the Secret Service said the personnel involved were relieved of duty and sent home before the president landed. But the news broke while he was there -- and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday that the incident distracted attention ""from what was a very important regional engagement for our president."" ""So we let the boss down, because nobody's talking about what went on in Colombia other than this incident,"" Dempsey said. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said he would consider holding hearings on the conduct of the members of the military involved in the scandal, but wants to learn more first. The committee's top Republican, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said he is sure ""the guilty will be punished,"" but lamented that a few members of the military and Secret Service ""have tarnished the reputations of many."" CNN's Barbara Starr, Jessica Yellin, Deirdre Walsh and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","NEW: Some of those implicated didn't believe women were prostitutes, U.S. official says .

"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (CNN) -- If you listen to inventor Dean Kamen, the biggest health problem facing the world today is not AIDS, obesity or malnutrition. It's a shortage of water. Dean Kamen hopes to tackle the world's fresh water shortage with the Slingshot, a water purifying device. Water is the most abundant resource on the planet, yet less than one percent of the Earth's freshwater supply is readily available to drink, according to the World Health Organization. Lack of accessible or clean drinking water, exacerbated by drought, is crippling communities in many developing countries. ""In your lifetime, my lifetime, we will see water be a really scarce, valuable commodity,"" Kamen says. Those are scary words from the man whose creations include the Segway personal motorized scooter and the Luke (as in Skywalker) prosthetic arm. But the forward-thinking inventor and his team at DEKA Research in Manchester, New Hampshire, aren't sitting around waiting for the world's wells to dry up. They've been working on an invention they say can tap into 97 percent of the world's undrinkable water. It's called the Slingshot, and it's a portable, low energy machine that is designed to purify water in remote villages where there's not a Wal-Mart in sight. The device takes its name from a well-known story. ""We believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its Goliath of a problem in water,"" Kamen says. ""So we decided to build a small machine and give it to the little Davids."" Perhaps you've heard about the Slingshot, which Kamen has been working on for more than 10 years. Over that time it has turned dirty river water, ocean water and even raw sewage into pure drinking water. Kamen says it can turn anything that looks wet, or has water in it, into the ""stuff of life."" The magic behind the Slingshot is a ""vapor compression distiller"" that stands between what looks like two empty fish tanks connected by a couple of hoses. One tank contains the contaminated liquid, the other is for the newly clean water.  Watch Kamen demonstrate the Slingshot » . The Slingshot boils, distills and vaporizes the polluted source, in turn delivering nothing but clean water to the other side. And it does it all on less electricity than it takes to run a hair dryer. In summer 2006, Kamen delivered two Slingshots to the small community of Lerida in Honduras. They were used for a month and Kamen says everything ran as planned. ""The machine worked very well down there, taking virtually any water that the people from that village brought to us,"" he says. ""All the water that we got from the machine was absolutely pure water."" But there's a problem. Kamen says each Slingshot costs his company several hundred thousand dollars to build. He's looking to partner with companies and organizations to distribute Slingshots around the world, but says a little more engineering work needs to be done in order to lower the production costs. Kamen says the company would like to get the price down to about $2,000 per machine. ""The biggest challenge right now between this being a dream and a reality is getting committed people that really care about the state of the world's health to get involved,"" Kamen says. The world's population is quickly approaching 7 billion, making access to clean water that much more important. According to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, more than 3.5 million people die every year from water-related diseases and almost 900 million don't have access to a safe water supply. Kamen says people in developing regions of the world need the Slingshot as soon as possible. He also thinks the problem with polluted water will spread beyond small villages. He says one Slingshot machine can supply about 250 gallons of water a day, which is enough for 100 people. That's a lot of Davids. ""It is literally like turning lead into gold,"" he says. ""But I believe it's more important, because you can't drink lead or gold.""","Segway inventor Dean Kamen wants to tackle the world's fresh water shortage .

"(CNN) -- Don Pardo, the announcer whose velvety baritone voice introduced ""Saturday Night Live"" hosts on NBC for decades, has died at age 96, the network announced. Pardo was the announcer for ""SNL"" for all but one season over the program's 39-year run. Prior to announcing for the comedy show, he was a familiar voice on NBC, handling the announcing duties on such programs as the old ""Price Is Right"" and the Art Fleming-hosted version of ""Jeopardy!"" In a tweet, ""NBC Nightly News"" described Pardo as ""legendary,"" and cast members from ""SNL's"" long run chimed in with approval. ""Any SNL actor will tell u:the ultimate moment of your career was hearing Don Pardo say your name. Each week he represented a dream come true,"" tweeted Rachel Dratch, who appeared on the show from 1999 to 2006. Seth Myers, who spent years on ""SNL"" before recently beginning his own late-night talk program, wrote, ""RIP Don Pardo. A voice that meant so much."" Pardo was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, on February 22, 1918. He began his career in theater in his native New England, but switched to announcing after being offered a job by a Providence, Rhode Island, radio station. While visiting NBC in New York in 1944 -- there to see some of his heroes at work -- Pardo was offered a job with the network, according to The New York Times. He stayed for the next seven decades. He became a familiar voice to generations of radio listeners and, later, TV watchers. Indeed, he was the NBC staff announcer on November 22, 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was shot. ""He was among the first to tell the nation about the assassination attempt on President John F. Kennedy,"" according to The Hollywood Reporter. The next year, he became the announcer for a game show that almost rivaled Pardo himself for longevity: ""Jeopardy!"" The original version, with Fleming as host, ran from 1964 to 1975. Pardo could regularly be heard telling viewers that the show's questions came from the Grolier encyclopedia and promising contestants some nice parting gifts, including a supply of Rice-a-Roni, ""the San Francisco treat."" In 1984, Pardo got a chance to parody himself on ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's recording of ""I Lost on Jeopardy,"" informing the floundering Yankovic that he was ""a complete loser."" He also had a bit part in the video. ""Very sad to hear of the passing of my old friend Don Pardo - truly one the all-time greats,"" tweeted Yankovic.. But for most people under 50, Pardo will always be the voice of ""SNL."" Though he was on staff at NBC, he seemed an odd choice for the show, his seemingly strait-laced bearing contrasting with the wild antics of what was, originally, the most iconoclastic comedy show on network TV. But that, said ""SNL"" creator Lorne Michaels, was the idea. ""It couldn't have been a more different culture,"" Michaels told The New York Times. ""But it was perfect for us."" Pardo also appeared in the movie ""Radio Days"" and on an episode of ""30 Rock,"" among other credits. People we've lost in 2014 .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A group of locals looked on warily as we filmed our piece inside a congested, riverside Delhi neighborhood. And they've every reason to feel nervous. A number of deadly collapses in recent months have thrust the issue of illegally constructed and unsafe housing into the spotlight. On June 28, a four-story building in the city suddenly toppled over killing 10 people, including five children. That same day, an eleven-floor building under construction came crashing down in the southern Indian city of Chennai, killing 61 workers. Both incidents made headlines outside India -- and rightly so. But for many of the people living in these neighborhoods, the publicity is not necessarily welcome. That's because they're among the poorest and most vulnerable -- on one hand they fear for the safety of their homes, and on the other they fear being forcibly evicted and their homes destroyed. They have nowhere else to go. So when TV crews arrive, many are understandably defensive. As we filmed in Laxmi Nagar, a neighborhood of eastern Delhi located along the Yamuna River, pockmarked with ramshackle residential blocks, a man approached us and questioned whether we had the right to film. ""You know, everyone gets worried when they see cameras pointing at their buildings,"" he explained. ""As the leader of this market association, we have to inquire about the purpose of your shoot."" Safety codes ignored . This part of the city is no stranger to disaster. In 2010, at least 65 people were killed when a building came down after its foundations had been weakened by rainwater. It's not just Delhi; decrepit constructions that don't conform to safety codes are a big problem in cities and towns across India, says Chandan Ghosh, from the Indian home ministry's National Institute of Disaster Management. He has surveyed Delhi's structures for decades, and says most break basic building regulations. He says the problem is so pervasive that enforcement has become impossible. ""Our systems are not equipped to enforce engineering standards required to build safe houses. There's a gross shortage of manpower, expertise -- and maybe will."" The Delhi residential block that caved in on June 28 was built on a plot barely 19 square yards. With no pillars or beams to support its floors, it collapsed after neighbors starting removing earth to re-build their own house. Safety codes prescribe at least 150 square yards of land is required to construct a standard apartment, explains Ghosh. Buildings in Indian cities are often unplanned and strung together in cramped rows, without space between them. Experts say this can be disastrous if one is more structurally vulnerable than the others. Owners of buildings often sell off parts of these buildings to individuals, who then construct extensions. ""This type of housing is not unauthorized but remains extremely dangerous,"" says Ghosh. ""Unfortunately, it's mushrooming all over without checks and balances."" 'Disaster waiting to happen' With rapid urbanization occurring since India liberalized its economy in the 1990s, New Delhi's population has grown exponentially to almost 17 million -- more than 21% in the past decade, census figures show. To make matters worse, Indian authorities believe the Indian capital is vulnerable to seismic activity. In 1999, an 6.5 magnitude earthquake some 173 miles (280 kilometers) from Delhi caused some damage to buildings in the city, but raised fears about the potential harm from another temblor of similar intensity happening nearer. It's a ""disaster waiting to happen,"" according to Ghosh. According to Delhi's disaster-management department website, ""Pockets with high-rise buildings or ill-designed high-risk areas exist without specific consideration of earthquake resistance. Similarly, unplanned settlements with sub-standard structures are also prone to heavy damage even in moderate shaking."" Yet people have to continue to put themselves at risk because they've nowhere else to go. ""A lethal cocktail of unethical constructions, substandard material (and) a lack of enforcement ... are endangering countless lives,"" says Ghosh. ""These fatal incidents happening every now and then are a warning. It's time all stakeholders, including citizens, took it seriously."" Meantime, two injured survivors mourn their loved ones at the site of last month's Delhi collapse. His head bandaged, Naeem recalled how he literally rode the wave of debris when he tumbled four floors down. Underneath the rubble were his wife and three children, who all died. ""I had just freshened myself up on the terrace. My wife and children were on lower floors. Suddenly, there was this boom. The building was down,"" he recalls. Abdul Rashid was also pulled out alive, suffering only bruising. But tragically, he too lost his wife and children. Both men blame the neighbors for digging on ground their houses stood on. ""There's no strong action against them. We will stage a protest to demand that,"" Rashid warns. Their neighbor, an unnamed man, has been charged with negligence, and faces a two-year jail term or fine upon conviction, police say.","India has seen a number of deadly building collapses in recent months .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry closed a trip to the Middle East saying countries ""in the region"" and ""outside the region"" are prepared to engage in military assistance against ISIS and ""in actual strikes if that is what it requires."" Critics have said Kerry's efforts to build an international coalition of Arab and European nations to fight ISIS were struggling. In an interview taped Saturday in Cairo, Egypt, that aired on CBS' ""Face The Nation"" Sunday, Kerry said some nations ""are clearly prepared to take action in the air alongside the United States and to do airstrikes, if that's what they're called on to do,"" but did not get more specific. Separately, a U.S. official traveling with Kerry told reporters, ""There have been offers to (U.S. Central Command) from Arab countries willing to take more kinetic actions,"" according to a pool report. On CBS, Kerry admitted that airstrikes alone will not solve the challenge of defeating ISIS, but he reiterated the administration's stance that there is no plan to put troops on the ground outside of local Iraqi forces and Syrian rebel groups. ""Well, we're not looking to put troops on the ground. There are some (nations) who have offered to do so, but we are not looking for that at this moment anyway,"" Kerry said. Integral to the White House strategy is an effort to train and equip Syrian rebel forces. On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said: ""We have had a relationship with these fighters now for a couple of years. They're getting better and more capable. And what's most important here is that the Syrian opposition on the ground fighting ISIL can count on American and coalition airpower to supercharge their effort. That's important and that's ultimately going to be what is called for in this strategy."" ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, is also known by the acronym ISIL. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who advocates using U.S. special forces if needed to fight ISIS, was harshly critical of the Obama administration on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I will not let this president suggest to the American people we can outsource our security. And this is not about our safety -- there is no way in hell you can form an army on the ground to go into Syria to destroy ISIL without a substantial American component,"" Graham said. ""This is a turning point in the war on terror. We are fighting a terrorist army, not an organization,"" Graham said. ""It's going to take an army to beat an army, and this idea that we'll never have any boots on the ground to defeat them in Syria is fantasy.""

"London (CNN) -- Human rights campaigners have welcomed a landmark decision in Saudi Arabia designed to combat domestic violence. However, they urge caution. The country's legal system is based on sharia law and rarely sees new laws being introduced. Critics allege that Saudi Arabia is known for suppressing women's rights, and it remains to be seen how this law will be put into practice, according to experts. For the first time in Saudi Arabia's history the kingdom's cabinet has approved a ban on domestic violence and other forms of abuse both at home and in the workplace. The law, which was passed last Monday, is meant to protect every citizen, but in particular the most vulnerable including children, women and domestic workers. The law is expected to be implemented within 90 days. Adam Coogle, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: ""We welcome the law because it makes crimes such as physical and emotional abuse easier to prosecute and it is a step in the right direction -- but the law has some major drawbacks. I'd urge caution until we see how exactly this law will be implemented and whether domestic abuse cases will now actually be punished in courts."" The law states that physical or sexual violence is punishable with a minimum jail sentence of one month and a maximum of one year, and fines of up to $13,300. Judges can double the sentence for repeat offenders. Abuse victims will be given access to necessary health care, psychological treatment and family counseling. According to Coogle, male guardianship in Saudi Arabia is a major obstacle to the new law. ""How can a woman escape an abusive husband if she's not allowed to drive and can't even travel without the permission of her male guardian?"" Coogle said. He is also concerned that the law does not mention the issue of marital rape. Eman Al Nafjan, a Saudi writer and blogger who tweets as Saudiwoman, told CNN: ""Having this in a country where we still have male guardianship system, where we still have child marriage -- it's a contradiction -- these things are still legal and yet you're talking about protection from harassment. It doesn't seem like a system where a lot of action will be taken. This seems to be more about talking than actually implementing."" Saudi woman files suit over right to drive . Domestic violence is a problem in Saudi Arabia but no reliable figures exist on how many people get abused each year. According to researchers there have been very few instances in the past where rapes and physical violence cases went to court as women do not dare to come forward. Until last week, no written penal code existed on domestic violence and physical abuse. That means that it was up to individual judges to determine what actions are illegal and how to punish them, if at all. The new law makes it easier to punish such crimes as they now can rely on written regulations. ""Judges own the courtroom,"" Coogle said. """"A man's testimony still carries more weight than that of a woman so we'll have to see whether this law will change the status quo."" Billionaire Saudi prince tweets support for women driving . Bandar al-Aiban, President of Saudi Arabia's Human Rights Commission which is backed by the Saudi government, told CNN: ""This is a very important law. We've been working on it for a long time. I'm very pleased to see it enacted. King Abdullah himself is behind this law,"" he said. ""This shows the kingdom is really moving forward with enacting laws that protect its citizens and residents and to make sure the kingdom is now in accordance with international obligations and international standards regarding human rights."" Earlier this year, a campaign was launched calling for an end to violence against women. In the King Khalid Foundation advert a woman wears a hijab with only her eyes visible - one clearly bruised and blackened.

"(CNN) -- Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb army commander wanted for crimes against humanity, is a notorious name synonymous with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the bloody assaults on Sarajevo and Srebrenica. Born in Kalnovik, Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the height of World War II, the 69-year-old was a career soldier who served in Yugoslavia's military before that nation dissolved in the early 1990s. Mladic then became a leader of Bosnian Serb forces during the brutal conflict in Bosnia, the bloodiest in Europe since the allies fought Germany in the 1940s. He was shaped by the war when his father was killed by Croat Nazis when he was 2 years old. In 1965 he graduated from a military academy and joined the Communist Party in Yugoslavia, an ethnic stew of six states -- Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Montenegro. Working his way up the ranks, Mladic was general of the Yugoslav Federal Forces in Sarajevo in 1992, an entity later transferred to the Bosnian Serb army when war engulfed Bosnia after it declared independence. The state was populated by Muslims, Croats and Serbs, but Serbian forces wanted to take lands where Serbs had been a majority. Mladic is charged with leading a 1992 siege against the city of Sarajevo, an assault that lasted two years and killed thousands. He is also accused of leading a 1995 attack on the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, where close to 8,000 Muslim men and boys died. In 1995, he was indicted by the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for war crimes and an international arrest warrant was issued a year later. Mladic faces charges of genocide, complicity in genocide, persecutions, extermination and murder, deportation and inhumane acts, unlawfully inflicting terror upon civilians, murder, cruel treatment, attacks on civilians and the taking of hostages. The genocide and complicity in genocide charges involve ""the planning, preparation or execution of the intentional partial destruction"" of Bosnian Muslims in various towns, including Srebrenica. In detailing its charges against Mladic, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia cites the ""widespread killing, deportation and forcible transfer of non-Serbs in furtherance of the 1992 and 1993 'ethnic cleansing' campaigns in the Bosnian Krajina and in eastern Bosnia; by causing serious bodily or mental harm to Bosnian Muslims, including torture, physical and psychological abuse, sexual violence and beatings."" It said Bosnian Muslims were subjected ""to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction, namely through cruel and inhumane treatment, including torture, inhumane living conditions and forced labor."" Such alleged crimes occurred many locations, including in Banja Luka and Srebrenica. The court also cites Mladic's alleged role in the Bosnian Serb siege on the city of Sarajevo. Mladic, working with others, planned and ordered ""a protracted military campaign in which Bosnian Serb forces under his control, in particular the Sarajevo Romanija Corps, used artillery and mortar shelling and sniping to target civilian areas of Sarajevo, killing and wounding civilians."" The U.S. Rewards for Justice program announced a $5 million reward for information leading to Mladic's capture. Over the years, he has eluded authorities as his cohort, the former Bosnia Serb president, Radovan Karadzic, was apprehended and is facing various charges at the court in The Hague.","Mladic's father was killed by Croatian Nazis .

"(CNN) -- Washington and Lee University cited slavery's ""regrettable"" role in the Virginia school's history and announced that it will remove Confederate battle flags from a chapel that serves as a major meeting place. The decision was announced in a message Tuesday from university President Kenneth Ruscio following discussions of concerns raised by black students about the campus environment. In 1826 the University -- then Washington College -- owned between 70 to 80 slaves and benefited from their labor, wrote Ruscio. ""Acknowledging that historical record -- and acknowledging the contributions of those individuals -- will require coming to terms with a part of our past that we wish had been different but that we cannot ignore,"" Ruscio said. Ruscio also said that the regimental flags are going to be removed from Lee Chapel. The flags are replicas of original and historic battle flags that were once at the site. The university in Lexington is named for President George Washington and Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who later served as school president until his death in 1870. He is buried in a crypt beneath the landmark chapel. The original flags will be placed on rotating display at Lee Chapel Museum in a more ""appropriate location"" where the stories behind them can be properly told, wrote Ruscio. A group of black law students, referred to as ""The Committee,"" has been communicating with the administration about its concerns, leader Brandon Hicks said Wednesday. Their letter began a dialogue between the students and the administration. ""It's about creating a climate on campus that everyone feels welcome,"" Hicks told CNN on why he sought the changes. He said some students felt uncomfortable with the flags at Lee Chapel. ""These are huge steps. We are ecstatic,"" Hicks said of Ruscio's announcement. Black students comprise 2% of the undergraduate student body at Washington and Lee. ""It's commendable that the university and the administration took into consideration the feelings of all students,"" Hernandez Stroud, former president of the Black Law Students Association, told CNN. ""I think these are age-old issues that are as challenging as they are controversial and I think there are people all across the spectrum that understand no solution will please everyone. But I do think what was incredibly encouraging was the care the administration used with these issues,"" Stroud said. ""Schools are more than just their history,"" Stroud said. In April, Ruscio said questions raised by law students were legitimate. ""Washington and Lee seeks to establish a climate of learning in which we treat all individuals with respect and trust. If even one person thinks that we have not met our aspiration in that regard, we must listen to them and examine why. We are doing so, and we will continue to do so,"" he wrote. In his letter Tuesday, the administrator said the purpose of the historic flags in a campus setting is to educate. ""They are not to be displayed for decoration, which would diminish their significance, or for glorification, or to make a statement about past conflicts,"" he wrote. ""The reproductions are not genuinely historic; nor are they displayed with any information or background about what they are. The absence of such explanation allows those who either 'oppose' or 'support' them to assert their own subjective and frequently incorrect interpretations."" Stroud says he does not hold a grudge against Washington and Lee, because no institution is void of racism.

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain called Monday for the United States to lead a military coalition to help the Syrian opposition rid the country of President Bashar al-Assad. ""The Syrian opposition needs to know that the United States stands with them and that we are willing to take risks to support them when they need it the most,"" the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. ""Inaction denies us the opportunity to have influence with forces in Syria who will one day inherit the country, ceding that to foreign states that may not always share our values."" McCain took aim at what he said is the Obama administration's toothless policy of calling for al-Assad to step aside. ""To say they are leading from behind is too general,"" he said. ""That suggests they are leading. They are just behind."" The Obama administration and much of the rest of the world have put their hopes of ending the 15 months of bloodshed on a peace plan put forth by U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy Kofi Annan. But that has failed to achieve results. The Republican senator from Arizona accused the administration, ""in its desperation,"" of now appearing to be placing its hopes on persuading the Russian government to push al-Assad from power. President Obama was meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday at the G-20 meeting in Los Cabos, Mexico. ""Russia is unlikely to ever support a policy of regime change in Syria,"" he said. Syria-bound Russian cargo ship loses insurance . The opposition, without help from the United States, has recently improved its military abilities and appears to be well enough organized to make use of outside support, he said. Though some foreign military assistance appears to be reaching the opposition, it is not enough to be decisive, and may just prolong the crisis, which could prove detrimental, McCain said. ""Nearly every Syrian I speak with tells me the same thing: the longer this conflict drags on, the more radicalized it becomes and the more it turns into an escalating civil war."" Failure to act could result in Syria becoming a failed state, riven by extremist violence and sectarian conflict, he said. McCain said any military aid should not include U.S. ground forces, but should include military might from allies of the United States, such as European and Arab countries. Already, some analysts say that opposition forces may be creating some areas of de facto control, along the border with Turkey and in eastern Syria, McCain said. One option would be for the opposition to declare those areas liberated, then call for external support in defending them, he said. ""Once defended, these safe havens could become platforms, staging areas for armed opposition groups,"" he said. McCain rejected characterizations of the current state of affairs inside Syria as a civil war. ""It's not a civil war because all the military strength is on one side, and not the other,"" he said. ""At least we ought to give them a chance to have a fair fight."" How dictators have evolved with the times .","""Give them a chance to have a fair fight,"" McCain says .

"Miami (CNN) -- A man who fled his trial on drug and racketeering charges in 1979 and eluded police in several different countries while on the run was arrested Thursday at a Florida senior living community, U.S. Marshals said. Mark Steven Phillips was arrested at the West Palm Beach, Florida, apartments by a U.S. Marshals ""Cold Case Fugitive Squad,"" authorities said. Authorities woke him while he was sleeping, the statement said, and the lead deputy marshal told him, ""The judge wants to see you, Mark."" ""The judge wants to see me from 30 years ago?"" Phillips replied, according to the statement. Phillips was set to appear Thursday before a federal magistrate and will appear ""in the near future"" before U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King -- ""the same judge he walked out on during his criminal trial,"" the Marshals said. Phillips was arrested on May 2, 1979, and charged with participating in racketeering activity; possession with intent to distribute marijuana; unlawful use of a communication facility; and engaging in a criminal enterprise, authorities said. Along with 13 other defendants, he was indicted and charged with violating the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) statutes, which charged that the organization imported ""multi-ton quantities of marijuana and cocaine"" into the United States between October 1974 and April 1978. Phillips was the corporate director for Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Striker Aluminum Yachts and functioned as a broker to buy vessels ""so the interior of the boats could be restructured to afford maximum cargo area for the transportation of the loads of marijuana to be received from mother ships on the high seas,"" the Marshals said. The 1979 indictment alleges that Phillips in March 1977 showed a co-conspirator two vessels that had recently been used to import 20 tons of marijuana into the United States, authorities said. In July 1977, he allegedly went to an address in Miami and picked up ""a suitcase filled with money,"" the U.S. Marshals statement said. ""Later that same night, he used the suitcase full of cash to purchase another yacht for $223,000"" for use on future marijuana smuggling trips, according to the indictment. Once the marijuana was distributed to ""the enterprise's wholesale customers,"" it was to be sold for $250 a pound, authorities alleged. Phillips was released from jail on July 5, 1979, after posting $25,000 bond, authorities said. His trial, along with that of his co-defendants, began on September 17 of that year. ""For approximately a month and a half, Phillips took part in his trial, but on November 5, 1979, Phillips got cold feet and failed to show up that day at the federal courthouse in Miami,"" the Marshals said. King issued a bench warrant for his arrest. His trial continued, however, and Phillips was convicted in absentia of seven counts of participating in a racketeering activity and possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Authorities investigating Phillips' disappearance received leads indicating he had fled the country, the Marshals said. In 1993, police gathered intelligence that Phillips had fled to Santiago, Chile, and assumed a new identity. He married a local woman using the name Marcus Steffan and created a commercial fishing company with her called ""Fishing Research Inc."" The company paid him $125,000 annually, authorities said. By the time U.S. Marshals received documentation of his new identity, however, Phillips had already left Chile. Eight years later, the Marshals received information that Phillips was traveling between Chile and Germany, authorities said, and found a passport had been issued for a Marcus Steffan in 1991 and renewed in 1999. Checking on the use of the Steffan name, investigators found Phillips had flown into New York from abroad several times. He had rented two penthouse apartments for $10,000 a month using the fake name, but was evicted in August 2000, they said. He had traveled to Chile in February 2001, authorities learned. He is thought to have remained in Chile until 2010, when deputy marshals assigned to the cold case squad learned he had returned to the United States and obtained a Florida driver's license using his real name, authorities said. They eventually developed new information about him renting an apartment at the West Palm Beach address, in a 55-and-older apartment complex. At the time of his arrest, it appeared Phillips was ""still living out of a suitcase,"" the U.S. Marshals statement said, citing deputy marshals who arrested him. ""There were no clothes in the drawers in the apartment. All his belongings were contained in one travel bag."" U.S. Marshals Senior Inspector Barry Golden said it was unclear how much prison time Phillips might face. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Mark Phillips fled his trial in 1979 .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Even when pared down to just its Interactive portion, South by Southwest can feel like a huge and amorphous thing -- sort of like, as director Hugh Forrest says, the Internet itself. This tech-themed gathering has exploded in the years since the term ""dotcom billionaire"" became a career goal for any 20-something with a computer and an idea. The Interactive portion of the festival now draws more than 30,000 people each year, more than both the original Music portion of the festival and Interactive's older cousin, Film. With that growth has come some meaningless noise. If you wanted to see a grown man in black fingernail polish swing on a wrecking ball like Miley Cyrus or hear a big-money venture capitalist attempt to rap onstage with Nas this week, you could. But beneath the noise, there's still a lot of signal. All-night parties and desperate sales pitches aside, South by Southwest is still where some of the digital world's smartest people come to talk about ideas that will guide agendas for years to come. It's where trends crystallize and where nascent startups take flight. And even at a disparate festival whose offerings ranged from wrestling superstar John Cena extolling the virtues of the online WWE Network to a discussion about how virtual reality may become a life-saving medical tool, some themes did emerge. Here are five of our takeaways from South by Southwest Interactive. No new Twitter ... and that's OK . From a tech perspective, South by Southwest's ""greatest hit"" was Twitter, the social network that came to the show in 2007 with a small core of support and left on the back of a hype rocket that, 240 million users later, helped make it part of the public's consciousness. In the years that followed, a handful of social startups like Foursquare and GroupMe earned more modest ""SouthBy bumps."" But, since then, the clamoring throngs of app creators in Austin have failed to produce a breakout. And, this week, it felt like fewer were even trying. ""I think that social media has become so baked into everything we do that the revolution has plateaued a little bit,"" said Forrest, the SXSWi director. ""Twitter was our big moment,"" he added. ""But I also think, at this point, it's our biggest albatross. (Observers now always ask) 'Why isn't there a Twitter this year?' "" Yes, plenty of entrepreneurs were promoting their products at SXSW this week, and that's not going to stop. But the more expectations fade for a new tech superstar to emerge, the more folks can enjoy seeing innovations without having to wonder whether every single one of them is the ""next big thing."" A crossroads for privacy . In 2014, many of us have adopted a perhaps oversimplified but nonetheless handy approach to online privacy: Assume you don't have any, and don't post anything you don't want the whole world to see. Some tech titans, like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, have argued that we live in a post-privacy age. But online privacy, particularly from the all-seeing eye of the world's governments, still has its champions, and some of the world's most visible spoke at South by Southwest. NSA leaker Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange both appeared remotely: Assange from an embassy in London and Snowden presumably from Russia, where he fled with state secrets he stole while working as a government contractor. Both called on tech-savvy attendees in Austin to create products that help Web users hide their activity from prying eyes. ""South by Southwest and the tech community, the people in the room in Austin, they're the folks who can fix this,"" Snowden said. ""There's a political response that needs to occur, but there's also a tech response that needs to occur."" Meanwhile, entrepreneurs and marketers at SXSW were discussing the best ways to make money off their users' data. The tech community, like the world at large, is at an online-privacy crossroads. Which way the momentum will shift remains to be seen. Gadgets galore . Until recently, Interactive week was about apps, websites and ideas. The shiny things that blink and buzz and flash belong at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas or the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, thank you very much. But, this year, there was a visible uptick in the number of places Austin-style innovation was merging with cutting-edge hardware. A drone used a Taser-like stun gun to knock some guy off of his feet. ""Game of Thrones"" fans used a virtual-reality headset, the Oculus Rift, to immerse themselves in a 3-D version of a scene from the fantasy series. Rows of 3-D printers were everywhere you looked, and although they had more ""gee whiz"" appeal last year, it was interesting to see the technology continue to evolve. (One of our favorites? 3D-printed candy from a machine built in partnership with Hershey.) There were developers showcasing wirelessly connected homes that memorize and accommodate your habits. The trend extended all the way to street teams hawking e-cigarettes, or ""digital vapor cigarettes,"" as the new ones are being called, because ""e-cigarette"" is so 2013. But nowhere did hardware and innovation merge more visibly at this year's festival than in ... Wearable tech . This trendy gear was so front-and-center at SXSW this week that it deserves its own category. Wearable technology -- gadgets on your body, such as fitness trackers -- was a standing-room-only event at SXSW's Startup Accelerator, where new companies pitch their products to investors in the hopes of attracting funding and press. One startup demoed solar-paneled clothing that can recharge a phone in two hours. Another pitched Nymi, a wristband that authenticates users through their unique cardiac rhythm and eliminates the need to type passwords on a mobile device. But the big winner was Skully, an augmented-reality motorcycle helmet. The helmet has a 180-degree rear-view camera that projects images to a headset display so the driver can see the road in every direction. The company's CEO, Marcus Weller, describes his product as ""like Google Glass, except it can save your life."" And speaking of Glass, seeing people walk around Austin in Google's connected eyewear was so commonplace that no one even bothered to look twice -- a rarity outside the Bay Area. Foreign flavor . It was impossible to grab a bite or a beer in downtown Austin this week without hearing animated conversations in languages other than English. More than ever, the festival is becoming an international affair, reaffirming how the digital revolution has spread far beyond Silicon Valley. People from a record 74 countries attended South by Southwest Interactive this week, up from 55 last year. Forrest said the influx of international visitors reflects the growth of the global startup scene. More than 70 businesses were represented at German Haus, a gathering space sponsored by Germany's business community. Enterprise Ireland brought 20 more. India, England, Sweden, France ... those are just a handful of the other countries that had a SXSW presence, official or otherwise. Facebook's recent $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp, the messaging service, heralds what's likely to be a recurring theme. As digital markets mature in the United States, the tech world will be increasingly looking at services, like WhatsApp, that have huge numbers of overseas users. As usual, SXSW is a nice condensed look at the bigger trend.","The South by Southwest Interactive festival just wrapped in Austin, Texas .

"(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius was the target of relentless and combative questioning Wednesday as the prosecutor in his murder trial tried to rattle the runner about the night he shot dead his model girlfriend. Vowing to ""get to the truth"" of the events that took place on Valentine's Day last year, prosecutor Gerrie Nel began a blistering cross-examination of the Olympic sprinter in the case that has gripped South Africa. ""You shot and killed her. Say it -- 'I shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp,'"" Nel told Pistorius. The prosecutor immediately boxed the double-amputee athlete into a corner in what his defense team described as an ""ambush,"" by asking him about a video showing Pistorius shooting a watermelon at a gun range. No one disputes that Pistorius killed Steenkamp. But the prosecution is trying to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did so knowingly and intentionally. The 27-year old has admitted to the killing but said he had mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder in the bathroom when he fired through the door and killed her. Before Nel went after Pistorius, Barry Roux -- the runner's defense lawyer -- had tossed his client a question to drive that argument home. He asked Pistorius if he had intentionally killed Steenkamp. ""I did not intend to kill Reeva or anybody else for that matter,"" Pistorius replied. Later in the proceedings, as Nel probed him further, Pistorius insisted he thought he would be attacked when he heard noise coming from his bathroom that night. ""I had a fear, I didn't have time to think, I discharged my firearm ... I didn't intend to shoot at anyone, I shot out of fear."" Court was adjourned for the day following that testimony. 'Zombie stopper' Minutes after starting his cross-examination, Nel took the defense team by surprise when he asked the athlete about a shooting range video in which Pistorius is seen firing at a watermelon, and then calling the impact ""a zombie-stopper."" This prompted the defense to complain that the prosecution was staging an ""ambush"" by introducing evidence. The court was briefly adjourned as Judge Thokozile Masipa considered both positions. The defense later said it would not object to the video being shown in court. ""It makes me very upset to hear myself saying something like that,"" Pistorius said as he admitted to making the comment. But he insisted he was referring ""to a zombie, not a human being."" Nel showed the court a graphic photo of Steenkamp's wounded head. Speaking of the watermelon in the video, the prosecutor said: ""It exploded. You know the same happened to Reeva?"" ""I was there, I don't have to look at a picture,"" Pistorius snapped, sobbing. Roux objected to Nel's comparison, and the judge agreed, adjourning proceedings to give Pistorius time to recover. His sister, Aimee, stood next to him to console him while he held his head in his hands and continued crying. 'My life is on the line' Upon Pistorius' return, Nel pressed the runner on whether his recollection of that night was a reconstruction of what he heard and read rather than what he remembered. Pistorius said it is what he remembers. ""My version has never changed,"" he said. Nel went over with a fine-tooth comb the version of events that Pistorius provided in an earlier bail application affidavit, and the version he has given on the witness stand over the past three days. He repeatedly asked the athlete about the location of two ventilation fans in his bedroom on the night of the killing, seeking to undermine the defense's contention that the crime scene was contaminated by clumsy police work and other factors. The detail was important, Nel told Pistorius, because ""it will show that you are lying."" Pistorius said his memory was not good but that he was not trying to lie. ""I can't change the truth,"" he said. The athlete conceded there is a discrepancy between his bail application and his court testimony, saying that a claim on the bail application that he went onto a balcony to retrieve a fan before the shooting was wrong. He added that he was not present when the bail application affidavit was written. Nel, who accused the runner of not answering questions directly at times, also asked Pistorius whether he was thinking of the implications of his answers. Pistorius said it would be reckless not to think of what he said, adding: ""My life is on the line."" ""Reeva doesn't have a life anymore,"" the prosecutor said. The night of the killing . At the beginning of the day, Pistorius finished telling the court what he remembered from the night Steenkamp died, starting with the moment he opened his bathroom door after shooting through it and saw her bloodied body. His voice quivering, the track star picked up where he left off the previous day, when he became so upset by his own testimony about that night that he broke down into uncontrollable sobs on the stand. Steenkamp was sitting slumped over the toilet bowl, Pistorius said while being questioned by his defense lawyer. He said he pulled her weight onto him and cried. That's when her blood streamed down on him, he said. Pistorius had grabbed Steenkamp's cell phone, but didn't know the pass code, so he went to get his own to call for help, he said. He called a neighbor, Johan Stander, who arrived soon after. The athlete said he shouted and screamed at Stander to help him get Reeva to the hospital. Then another neighbor, Dr. Johann Stipp, a physician, arrived at the house. The doctor seemed overwhelmed by the situation, Pistorius said. The athlete also described the moments after paramedics had arrived at the scene. ""Reeva had already died while I was holding her, before the ambulance arrived,"" he said. ""I knew there was nothing more they could do for her."" He also spoke of when police officers arrived at his door -- one of them a key witness in his trial, former Col. G.S. van Rensburg, Pistorius said. ""Every time I looked up there were more people in the house. There were more policemen. There were people going up and down the stairs. I was standing in the kitchen. I asked a policeman if I may wash my hands because the smell of blood was making me throw up."" After pictures were taken, police told him he was under arrest and would face charges. Apology . On his first day on the stand, Monday, Pistorius made a tearful apology to Steenkamp's family. The prosecution alleges Pistorius killed his girlfriend after they argued. Roux had also delved deeper into his connection with Steenkamp, trying to show they had a loving relationship. The couple met a little more than three months before Steenkamp died at the age of 29. In affectionate messages read out in court, the pair used pet names like ""baba"" and ""angel,"" said they missed each other and exchanged many ""x""s, or kisses. Only those in the courtroom can see Pistorius because he has chosen not to testify on camera. His testimony can be heard on an audio feed. Steenkamp's mother, June, has sat in court throughout Pistorius' three days on the stand. The defense team will call 14 to 17 witnesses, Roux said as he opened his case. The trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of May. Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials.

"(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius was not mentally incapacitated when he shot his girlfriend to death, a psychiatric assessment of the athlete has found. The results of the assessment were revealed in court Monday when the Olympic sprinter's trial resumed after a monthlong break for the evaluation. According to the findings by an independent panel of doctors, Pistorius did not suffer from a mental defect or mental illness at the ""time of the commission of the offense that would have rendered him criminally not responsible of the offenses charged."" The report added that ""Mr. Pistorius was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act."" Had the doctors deemed Pistorius mentally incapacitated during the shooting, the trial would have immediately ended in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. Pistorius, 27, is accused of murdering his girlfriend, 29-year-old model and law school graduate Reeva Steenkamp, in his home in February 2013. Pistorius admits shooting Steenkamp through a closed door, killing her, but has told the court in Pretoria, South Africa, that he mistook her for an intruder. He has pleaded not guilty. The state says Pistorius argued with Steenkamp before killing her. On May 20, trial Judge Thokozile Masipa ordered Pistorius to report for a psychiatric evaluation to establish whether he was criminally responsible for his actions. The prosecution and defense said they accepted the report's findings. The defense has resumed its case. Psychiatrist's testimony . Pistorius' psychiatric testing last month was triggered by the testimony of a psychiatrist who said the sprinter has suffered from generalized anxiety disorder since he was an infant, stemming partly from the amputation his lower legs. The disorder meant Pistorius had ""excessive"" concerns about security and felt threatened even when, objectively, he was not, Dr. Merryll Vorster testified on May 12. After Vorster's testimony, prosecutor Gerrie Nel filed a motion asking the judge to require psychiatric tests, arguing that if there was any chance the defendant's mental health was an issue, the court must ""err on the side of caution."" Nel's extremely unusual move was essentially an effort to maneuver the court into considering an insanity or ""capacity"" defense even though the athlete's legal team is not mounting one, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. Phelps said Nel appeared to be placing a high-stakes bet that experts would disagree with Vorster's evidence. Pistorius' lead defense lawyer, Barry Roux, argued against the tests, describing Nel's reading of the law as ""unfortunate."" But Masipa ordered the evaluation, saying the defense's act of putting a psychiatrist on the stand had raised the question of the athlete's mental health. Testing began on May 26. Light and balance . When court resumed Monday, the defense called Pistorius' orthopedic surgeon Dr. Gerald Versfeld as a witness. Versfeld described the limitations of Pistorius' mobility, based on his examination of the athlete and Pistorius' own description. In his cross-examination, Nel focused on the effect of light on Pistorius' balance. In his affidavit, Pistorius said he had rushed to the bathroom on stumps with a pistol after hearing a noise. He said he had been too scared to turn the lights on. ""It was pitch dark in the bedroom, and I thought Reeva was in bed."" Nel suggested to Versfeld that it would have been ""highly unlikely"" that Pistorius would have been able to walk on his stumps without falling if it had been pitch black in the bedroom, given the objects in it. ""If it was indeed pitch dark, that is so,"" Versfeld replied. Roux referred to Pistorius' evidence that there had been slight illumination. ""The moment there is light available, he will be able to use his vision to balance,"" Versfeld said, agreeing that if Pistorius had known the objects in his room, that would also have helped protect him from falling. Sound of screams . Acoustic engineer Ivan Lin was the second witness to take the stand Monday. He told court that ""typically,"" one can differentiate between male and female screams, but not without exception. Previous witnesses have described hearing a woman's screams between shots the night Steenkamp died, but the defense has argued that Pistorius sounds ""like a woman screaming"" when he's anxious. Lin said it would be ""impossible"" to replicate the ""highly complex sound transmission"" from Pistorius' house the night he killed Steenkamp. He explained how different variables could affect the transmission. Verdict . At the trial's conclusion, Masipa will have to decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a mistake or killed Steenkamp intentionally. If she does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to at least 15 years in prison and possibly life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion.

"(CNN) -- Mobile World Congress is the world's largest mobile phone trade show, held every year in Barcelona. It is the venue for manufacturers like Nokia, HTC, LG, and Samsung to reveal the must-have mobile devices and services of the year. This year is likely to be no different with big launches expected from all the major players except Apple. So what can we expect? Some phone makers have already announced their MWC line up, some have hinted, others have been rumored. Talking to sources, joining the dots, and getting the word on the street, this is what is expected at the show: . Nokia . Nokia is rumored to be launching a number of handsets at MWC this year. Some will focus on emerging markets (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), while the others, the developed ones. The phones you are most likely to be interested in will be a European version of the recently announced Nokia Lumia 900, and a low end Lumia; the Nokia Lumia 610. Both models will work with Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 operating system. HTC . We are expecting three handsets from the Taiwanese company; The HTC One X, The HTC One S, and the HTC One V. The top-of-the-range One X will feature the new Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor and run Android, while Pocket-lint has confirmed with sources that the One V will be a music-focused device aimed at men and similar to the more female friendly (if that is possible) HTC Rhyme that is already on the market. Samsung . Although Samsung was expected to launch the Samsung Galaxy S III at MWC this year, the company has now confirmed that it won't. With a number of pre-MWC launches already detailed, Samsung is expected instead to focus on tablets at the show. If rumors are to be believed, it will launch a 10.1-inch version of the Samsung Galaxy Note announced in September 2011. The difference from all the other tablets it sells? It will have a built-in stylus. LG . Following Samsung's lead with the Galaxy Note, LG has announced its LG Optimus Vu prior to the show. A cross between a phone and a tablet, it will measure 139.6mm x 90.mm, meaning it's going to be one for those with big hands and big pockets. There are also rumors that the company will announce a follow up to the LG Optimus 2X called the 3X. Expect it to have a quad-core processor too. Research In Motion . BlackBerry maker RIM has said that there will be no new hardware at the show this year, but that it will be showing off the new PlayBook 2.0 operating system and the software operating system, BB OS 10, that it hopes will power its new phones expected later in the year. Panasonic . Having just announced a new waterproof and dustproof phone called the Eluga, Panasonic has also confirmed it has a second handset in the pipeline to launch at MWC. It will feature a dual-core processor, OLED screen and will run Android. Fujitsu . Japanese brand Fujitsu has confirmed that it will be launching phones in Europe following its success in Japan. The company has yet to announce which models it will be bringing the continent, however the smart money is on the waterproof quad-core Tegra 3 powered Android smartphone it announced at CES in Las Vegas in January. Sony (aka Sony Ericsson) Trying to pinpoint a Sony phone destined for Mobile World Congress is as hard as Sony Ericsson's transitions to Sony. We are expecting a European launch for the already announced (at CES) Sony Ericsson Xperia S though. Rumors and leaked internet photos suggest maybe a bigger screen version too, as well as an array of other Android devices. Motorola . Motorola's MWC plans are even quieter than Sony's with the company traditionally focusing on CES in Las Vegas to launch many of its first-half-of-the-year handsets. There is a suggestion that Motorola has teamed up with Intel to launch one of the first Intel-powered smartphones, but that is still to be confirmed. Motorola doesn't have a press conference at the show, but Intel does.","Nokia, HTC expected to lead a busy field for new mobile device launches at Mobile World Congress .

"(CNN) -- Do you believe in second chances? It would appear that those wearing the green and white of Celtic do. Having been handed a brutal beating by Polish side Legia Warsaw in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, Celtic's European adventure appeared to be over before it had started. A 4-1 defeat in the Polish capital was followed by a 2-0 home defeat -- a result which should have sent Legia through to the playoff stage. Except it didn't. Instead, UEFA, the game's European governing body, was called in to rule over claims Legia had fielded an ineligible player during the tie. Bartosz Bereszynski, who entered the action with two minutes of the second leg remaining, was supposed to be serving a ban. It was his presence on the field which meant UEFA awarded the game to Celtic 3-0, making it 4-4 on aggregate and allowing the Scottish champion to progress on away goals. While Legia protested, even taking their failed case to CAS, the Court for the Arbitration of Sport, Celtic ensured it made the most of it fortune. A game against Slovenian champion Maribor was Celtic's reward with the opportunity to play some of European football's biggest names the prize. Celtic, which won the European Cup in 1967, took the lead within six minutes of the kickoff when Callum McGregor fired home from close range after Jo Inge Berget's effort was diverted into his path. Maribor, which last reached the group stage of the tournament in 1999, overcame Maccabi Tel Aviv 3-2 on aggregate in the previous round. And it soon carved Celtic open to claim a deserved equalizer when Damjar Bohar ran through to slot the ball past the onrushing Craig Gordon. Both teams had opportunities to win the game with Charlie Mulgrew and Virgil van Dijk going close for the visitors, while Tavares' rasping effort flew just over the crossbar for Maribor. The two will meet again next Tuesday with Celtic now the firm favorite to progress following the 1-1 draw. Elsewhere, Porto, the 2004 champion, gained an impressive 1-0 win at French side Lille. Hector Herrera's 61st minute strike was enough to give Porto a slender advantage going into next week's second leg. In Belgium, Oleg Shatov scored the only goal of the game as Zenit St Petersburg recorded a 1-0 away win at Standard Liege. In the night's other games, Slovan Bratislava drew 1-1 with BATE Borisov, while Aalborg and Apoel finished 1-1.","Celtic held 1-1 by Slovenian side Maribor in Champions League playoff .

"(CNN) -- Eureka! A husband and wife are reveling in their good fortune after finding $10 million in rare gold coins buried on their property in Northern California. The gold country discovery is thought to be the largest of its kind in U.S. history, according to David Hall, co-founder of Professional Coin Grading Service, which authenticated the find. ""It's quite a story. People were walking along on their property in Northern California, noticed something, began digging and they found cans of gold coins,"" Hall said. ""It should have happened to you and me."" The incredible find . The coins were unearthed in February 2013 by the husband and wife, who wish to remain anonymous. They were walking their dog when they spotted something shiny on the ground. The couple dug and eventually discovered eight metal cans, containing more than 1,400 gold coins. No one knows how they got there, or whom the coins might have belonged to. ""Somebody could have buried them and then died before they let anybody know where they were,"" Hall said. ""Believe it or not, I know cases where they forgot they had something, or they moved or whatever ... It could have been some kind of robbery deal ... Who knows?"" The treasure is known as the ""Saddle Ridge Hoard"" because it was discovered near a hill the couple called Saddle Ridge. In their effort to stay anonymous, the husband and wife aren't saying exactly where the fortune was found. These coins could change history . The coins . The coins, in $5, $10 and $20 denominations, date from 1847 to 1894. Most were minted in San Francisco. They have a combined face value of about $27,000, but experts believe they could fetch $10 million or more. Many are in pristine condition, including at least 14 coins that are considered the finest known for their date and mint mark. A highlight from the hoard is an 1866-S No Motto Double Eagle, valued at close to $1 million. The couple is planning to sell much of the collection. Approximately 90% of the coins will go up on Amazon.com's ""Collectibles"" site, according to Don Kagin, of Kagin's, Inc., who is assisting the anonymous owners. He told CNN the couple wants to donate some of the proceeds to charity. ""Basically they're thankful and they think it's wonderful that they're going to be able to save their property that they thought they might lose and, again, they want to give back to the community and to needy people,"" he said. Collectors wanting a sneak peek can see some of the coins at the American Numismatic Association's 2014 National Money Show in Atlanta, which opens Thursday. ""Unlike other hoards and treasures, this one includes a great variety of coins struck over many different years, and many of the coins are still in pristine condition,"" Kagin said.

"(CNN) -- As Christmas Eve became Christmas Day around the world, services and celebrations marked the holiday. At Vatican City on Friday night, Catholic worshippers packed pews inside St. Peter's Basilica to hear Pope Benedict XVI deliver Midnight Mass. He prayed to God for peace. ""Grant us the grace of true brotherhood. Help us to become like you. Help us to recognize your face in others who need our assistance,"" he said. ""And help us to live together with you as brothers and sisters so as to become one family -- your family."" Celebrants, both young and old, watched in reverence as the choir serenaded the pontiff during his ceremonial march into the church. He was led into St. Peter's for Christmas Eve services by 30 cardinals, a tradition that was started by Pope John Paul II. Bells rang out during the Holy Eucharistic, with chimes that could be heard inside the church as well as throughout Vatican City. In 2009, Midnight Mass was interrupted when 25-year-old Susanna Maiolo jumped a barrier and knocked the pontiff down. She had tried to get to the pontiff on Christmas Eve in 2008, but was detained, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said. Christmas Eve Mass was held at 10 p.m last year, so the pope, who was 82 years old at the time, would be well-rested for Christmas Day services. Thousands converged Friday on Bethlehem to celebrate Christmas in the town where Jesus is believed to have been born, joining the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Fouad Twal, and a Roman Catholic archbishop for Midnight Mass. Twal, the highest-ranking Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, led a procession of priests and believers to the Church of the Nativity for the traditional service. Pilgrims, many of whom visit the city every year at this time, packed Manger Square outside the church in anticipation of the patriarch's arrival. ""When we come, we are saying not only, yes Jesus, we are here; we are all Christian, we are all brothers,"" one tourist in the crowd outside the Nativity Church told CNN. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and President Mahmoud Abbas, Muslims, traveled to Bethlehem to attend the Mass. At least 90,000 tourists are expected to visit the city by the end of the Christmas season, according to Bethlehem Mayor Victor Batarseh. The city is near the high wall that forms part of Israel's West Bank barrier. In 1948, Christians represented 80% of the Bethlehem's population, that number is now just 35%. Inside Beijing's Immaculate Conception Cathedral, more than 1,000 Chinese parishioners gathered to say Mass on Friday. The ceremony was heralded by hymns and Christmas carols, and was led by a young priest who asked the congregation to ""pray for the holy father, Pope Benedict XVI, and the Chinese bishops."" It's a stark change from the 1960s and '70s, when religion was suppressed in China. Now, the sights and sounds of Christmas are all around, making it one of the biggest commercial holiday seasons in Chinese cities. While many Chinese are taking advantage of the lucrative side of the season, others are searching for the meaning of Christmas. ""My parents are Catholic,"" said 19-year-old Joseph Min. He said many youths are lost in the nation's ""wave of social changes,"" but many are ""seeking a kind of religion or philosophy in life."" China has become home to more than 6 million Catholics, according to a report approved at the eighth National Congress of Chinese Catholics in early December, the China Daily said. Beijing and the Vatican severed diplomatic ties in 1951, but efforts are reportedly under way to reconcile their differences. CNN's Paula Hancock and Jaime FlorCruz contributed to this report.","The pope prays for peace .

"(Oprah.com) -- In 1986 Susan King hit her head -- hard -- in a car accident. The result was more than a concussion. Afterward, when King looked at people, she saw images of events occurring in their lives and had flashes of insight about them. With uncanny knowledge of their situations, she has been able to advise clients on everything from job searches to divorce proceedings. King refers to her work as intuitive counseling, and though her vocation may seem rarefied, she believes that intuitive power is available to everyone. ""To me it's our body's radar, helping us make all sorts of decisions -- if only we're willing to pay attention."" Oprah.com: 10 questions that have no right to go away . My intuition has gone through a metamorphosis from the time I was a young child to where I am now. I used to just get feelings. I went from getting feelings to having dreams, to seeing symbols that meant things, to seeing things actually happening to other people, to feeling that what's happening to other people is happening to me. Intuition is knowing without knowing. It's instinctively knowing something that you don't know how you know. You meet people and you have a subconscious feeling: You like them or not. You trust them or you don't. And sometimes you stop and think, Where does that come from? What is that? Oprah.com: When to trust your gut . I believe that just as we hear and see and smell and taste, this is another sense we have, but it's one we don't recognize. I think it's almost an animal sense that we've forgotten. We were better at intuition in the past. With modern technology and the frantic pace of life, most people today spend their lives running. Never stopping to listen. There's no time for the mind to be quiet to listen to anything. And then when a problem comes: trauma. Because people are not in touch with themselves at all. You have to incorporate in your day some quiet time to listen to that voice. If you don't, you won't hear it. But it's there. It's meant to guide us. Oprah.com: Are you listening to your life? If you were to go out and meet somebody, spend an hour with them, and there was an attraction, and you came back home and wrote down the first thing you felt when you saw them, when they spoke to you, when they touched your shoulder -- you may not realize it, but you'd find that you'd already built a subconscious profile of the person. We all have that capability, but we don't use it. I'll tell you a group who uses intuition: people who do martial arts. They have to anticipate what their opponent's going to do. Remember Bruce Lee? Even people coming from behind, he could see. It's like he had eyes in the back of his head. There are times when you get a feeling about something -- say, I don't want to get on this flight -- and you wonder: Is it my anxiety, or is it real? It's difficult to know what's fact or fiction. You can only judge over a period of time. You have to gain confidence in your ability to listen. Number one, you can build up to 15 minutes a day of sitting and focusing on your breathing. So that you have quiet time to connect with your inner self. Oprah.com: 7 ways to reduce your stress from Dr. Oz . Number two, every day, live the day and enjoy the day. Don't be anxious about, Is this gonna happen or is that gonna happen? Walk through your day -- don't run. Get a little notebook, a tiny thing that fits in your pocket. When you have a feeling about something, write it down. That way, when your feeling later turns out to have been correct, you can go back and see that your instincts were working. And that builds your confidence. Intuition is like a muscle. You develop it the more you use it. One of the worst things in life is indecision and confusion. It plagues everybody. But confusion is sometimes a blessing when it stops you from making a move, because sometimes you're not supposed to make a move. I say to people, ""You don't walk down stairs blindfolded, you don't drive a car blindfolded -- why would you want to make massive life-changing decisions when you can't see what you're doing? You have to wait for clarity."" So to me, confusion can be a kind of intuition: your body's way of saying, don't do anything right now -- just go with the flow and the answer will come. I've given lots of talks, to all kinds of groups, and sometimes you'll get people -- usually men -- who will say, ""I think it's a load of old rubbish."" And I'll say, ""Well, that's your belief. I'm not here to change your belief."" The most important thing is just to trust it. Trust in your gut. Trust that first feeling you feel about something. Because that very first feeling is usually the right one. Oprah.com: The gut whisperer: 3 exercises to help you tune in . --As told to Susan Casey .

"(CNN) -- The Balkans are enduring the worst floods since records began 120 years ago. The situation is being exacerbated by the risk of landmines from the Bosnia war resurfacing. Already 26 bodies have been recovered, and rescuers expect to find more as flood waters recede. Even though the intense rainfall subsided Monday, the disaster is far from over. CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said flooding in the region will last at least another week -- and in some places, it could get worse. Southern Europe is no stranger to heavy rain events: the low pressure system currently drenching the Balkan Peninsula was detached from the main weather pattern and is known as a ""cutoff low."" This meteorological event has slowly dumped more than 100 millimeters of rain in only a few days, leaving rivers swollen and towns underwater. A cutoff low is similar to an eddy in the curve of a river that becomes isolated from the main current. Like a curve in a river, a cutoff low begins as a dip (trough) in the winds known as the westerlies. When one of these eddies becomes cut off from the main westerly flow, the closed circulation can last for two to three days on average. In the case of last week, the cutoff low lasted up to four days and dumped two months' worth of rain. During the first stage of a cutoff low, a deep trough of cold air will dip south resembling an upside-down Omega-type shape in the jetstream. Cold air will then start to encircle the low on the west side, as the warm humid air moves north along the east side of the low. Eventually the warm air will wrap completely around, creating a pocket of cold air within the core of the low pressure system. The low will now drift slower than if it was a part of the main jetstream. Over the course of an average of two to three days -- occasionally as much as 10 or more -- the low-pressure system will merge back with the jetstream as the next dip (trough) digs southward and picks up the cutoff low. The existence of a cutoff low pattern occurs most commonly in Southern Europe, according to a 2004 study of cutoff low systems in the Northern Hemisphere. Other areas also mentioned in the study were the eastern Atlantic coast, the North Pacific and the Northern China-Siberian region. The effect of this weather system is exacerbated in the Balkans, where rivers are used to move trade and goods. CNN Weather Anchor Mari Ramos explained how the region is affected. ""Serbia, for example, is landlocked. Historically, the Sava and Danube rivers are the main commerce line to the Black Sea in the east and to the rest of Europe in the west. ""Rivers also supply hydrolectric power. You might think, more water means more power, but that is not necessarily the case. Excessively high water levels -- just like extremely low levels -- affect the efficiency level and energy output. Many smaller power stations are flooded -- some temporarily, while others are permanently damaged."" Rivers in the Balkans also represent the main supply of fresh water. ""High water levels contaminate water treatment plants leaving thousands without drinking water,"" Ramos explained. Water is also used for industry so factories, fisheries and agriculture are all affected by these floods, she added.

"(CNN) -- Here's what I want for Father's Day: I want my children to develop a passion for science. I've decided to grease the wheels. I've called the best for advice. His name is Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University. He's getting kids engaged at his World Science Festival. He has even written a children's book based on relativity, ""Icarus at the Edge of Time."" Icarus was the boy in the ancient Greek myth whose father crafted him wings of wax. The father warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun. Icarus ignored him. His wax wings melted, and he died. Greene's reincarnation of Icarus was born on a space ship -- part of a community of explorers on a 25-trillion mile search for life on another planet. He is 14, which gets my attention, because it's about the same age as my oldest daughter. The length of the spaceship's journey means Icarus must live his whole life within the confines of that ship. ""But,"" writes Brian Greene, the boy ""had a palpable yearning for something beyond the life he'd been handed."" One day the ship's captain, Icarus' father, announces: ""We are making an emergency course diversion to avoid an uncharted black hole."" Icarus has built his own small spacecraft. He has done the calculations. He ignores his father's warning. He sets out to approach the black hole, to get within ""a hairsbreadth above the point of no return."" He miscalculates ever so slightly and is thrust 10,000 years into the future. He is found by a new generation and is briefed on the long history he just missed, including the fact that the universe was now, as a result of the mission his father commanded, in an era of interstellar cooperation and lasting peace. When Greene's wife read the story to their young son, the boy cried at the thought of the permanent separation. My own son, after he heard the story, wanted Greene to write a sequel that could bring Icarus back in time to be reunited with his dad. I do not want my children to follow Icarus' perilous and lonely path. Or do I? The young explorer . Greene says he wrote the book in part because he felt the Greek myth sent the wrong message: ""That if you're a courageous young spirit, you pay for it with your life,"" Greene tells me. ""My experience as a scientist is that, in order to push the boundaries of knowledge, you need to go where people tell you not to go."" It's an approach to life that psychologist Carol Dweck has found to be critical in a child's development. Dweck is a professor of psychology at Stanford University. And in some ways Icarus is her kind of kid. Not that Dweck would ever encourage a child to fly near a black hole. But she's impressed that Greene's Icarus took a calculated risk -- not a reckless one. And his goal was worthy. ""It sounds as though Icarus weighed the pros and cons and made an informed decision. He was in search of knowledge and satisfying a real intellectual curiosity."" Mindset . In 40 years of studying children, Dweck has identified a key factor that makes some children more resilient than others -- a characteristic that enables them ""to be able to withstand turbulence, to bounce back when they're knocked down."" Dweck calls it mindset -- the growth mindset. With a growth mindset, says Dweck, ""people believe their basic abilities can be enhanced, developed through hard work, appropriate risk taking, experimentation, good instruction."" With a fixed mindset, ""a child tends to view intelligence as a trait you either have or don't. You are either smart or dumb. That's it."" Kids who have this fixed mindset, says Dweck, see it as ""a huge risk to try something hard because then they may stumble and prove themselves not smart."" So they play it safe. Too safe. They don't challenge themselves. When Dweck works with children, she teaches them ""how their brains grow new connections every time they move out of their comfort zones -- every time they try hard things."" So, Dweck asks, ""How do we create conditions for children to try hard things -- to be appropriately risk taking and resilient?"" Her answer: ""They are the same conditions that create a growth mindset."" The dinner table . Dweck suggests we find ways to communicate to our children that ""we value doing hard things, persisting, focusing -- without preaching, of course. ... Even sitting around the dinner table and asking, 'Who had a great struggle today? What are you going to struggle with tomorrow?' "" The more you listen to Dweck's insights about the growth mindset -- the more you realize how much it has in common with the spirit of science. It's about taking the risk to explore. To discover. To fail. To get back up when you're knocked down and explore some more. Icarus revisited . ""Icarus at the Edge of Time"" was performed last month by ""Star Trek"" actor LeVar Burton and an 80-piece orchestra in a 3,000-seat theater in New York packed with teachers, parents and students. A girl in the audience, Sadie, later asked: ""Will Icarus be OK?"" That's what we parents want to know. Will our children be OK when we're not there to protect them? Brian Greene's Icarus took a risk. He miscalculated. He survived. And he has a growth mindset. He is curious and resilient. I have to imagine, Icarus will be OK. Do you think encouraging risk-taking in children is a good idea? Share your opinion in the comments section below.","Michael Schulder asked some experts how he could interest his kids in science .

"London (CNN) -- New information has emerged from an intelligence operation about the possibility of an attack being planned in or near London, with subway stations and airports of particular concern to officials, a British security source told CNN Thursday. CNN understands that the intelligence operation concerns a possible Mumbai-style attack, the source said. The action is not connected to terrorism arrests last month in Stoke, Cardiff and London, the source said. A second British security source said a decision was made Wednesday night to raise the terrorism threat level from ""substantial"" to ""severe"" for the civil aviation industry and London transport. The overall, national terrorism threat level remains at ""severe."" Increased security precautions have gone into effect at train and subway stations and Heathrow Airport, though an attack is not considered imminent, a second British security source said. Britain's emergencies team, which is composed of senior politicians and police officials, met Thursday morning to discuss the situation, the second source added. ""The threat level to the UK is at severe, which means that an attack is highly likely, and has been since January 2010,"" said the Metropolitan Police in a statement. ""We will police accordingly and use a range of covert and overt tactics which remain under constant review. As Assistant Commissioner of Special Operations John Yates said recently, recent events at East Midlands Airport and continued speculation about 'Mumbai-style' attacks serve as a stark reminder of the real and enduring threat we continue to face from terrorist groups."" ""Security at our airports remains at a high level, and we remain vigilant at all times,"" said a spokesman for the British Aviation Authority, which is responsible for Heathrow. Last fall, counterterrorism officials in Europe and the United States told CNN that al Qaeda was planning coordinated, Mumbai-style attacks in Europe, with the United States also possibly being targeted. That discovery led the United States to issue an unprecedented travel advisory in October for citizens traveling in Europe. It was not clear whether Thursday's information was related to last fall's al Qaeda threat. At the time CNN reported the story in November, European counterterrorism officials were saying they believed the aim was to carry out the attacks before the end of the year. In November 2008, gunmen belonging to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistani jihadist group affiliated with al Qaeda, went on a shooting rampage against several targets in Mumbai, India, including the city's most prestigious hotel, the main railway station and a Jewish center. More than 160 people were killed. CNN's Andy Carey and Jonathan Wald contributed to this story .","British security source cites intelligence about possibility of attack being planned .

"(CNN) -- Ramiro Valdes, 77, is one of only four remaining original rebels led by Fidel Castro in the 1950s in Cuba. By Cuban standards, he has had a remarkable career, serving the Castro brothers loyally for years in a variety of posts, some which made him notorious. Now, Valdes has accepted a new task outside Cuba that is raising skepticism. He arrived this week in Venezuela as a consultant for that country's energy crisis. Venezuela is facing critical electricity shortages that have created rolling blackouts in some areas. The government of Hugo Chavez blames a long drought that has reduced energy production at the country's main hydroelectric dam, while others say the real problem is a lack of investment in energy infrastructure. The issue has become a political one, but regardless of the reason for the electricity shortages, experts warn that Venezuela faces a complete electric collapse if something isn't done soon. That's where Valdes comes in, as well as the critics who have seized upon his biography. ""His reputation is as a ruthless minister of interior,"" said Ann Louise Bardach, who wrote about Valdes in her book ""Without Fidel: A Death Foretold in Miami, Havana and Washington."" Valdes has been with the Castro brothers from the beginning of the revolution and today is arguably the No. 3 man in the Cuban hierarchy, she said. As interior minister, Valdes oversaw secret police operations and gained a reputation for being ruthless when it came to suppressing dissidents. ""He's known for his willingness to do crackdowns,"" Bardach told CNN. Most recently, he has been in charge of the Internet on the communist island. ""He's the one who makes sure most Cubans don't have access to the Internet,"" Bardach said. One thing Valdes lacks, critics say, is experience in the energy sector. ""For us engineers in Venezuela, it makes no sense,"" Enzo Betancourt, president of Venezuela's Association of Engineers, told CNN. There are plenty of qualified engineers in the country with the experience to fix the electricity shortfalls, he said. Furthermore, Venezuelan engineers are already familiar with the electric system and equipment in the country, he added. Chavez has been under increased pressure lately because of the energy problem and other domestic quarrels, including the suspension of an opposition cable broadcaster -- ostensibly for not following broadcast laws. The move resulted in many days of protests and marches, organized in part online through social networking sites. In a televised speech, Chavez went so far as to say that spreading criticism against the government through the Internet constitutes ""terrorism."" So critics are eying the subsequent hiring of Cuba's top Internet censor to help Chavez in Venezuela. ""This man presumably came here to do things other than help us [with the electricity problems],"" Betancourt said. After all, Bardach said, Valdes is the man who has referred to the Internet as a ""wild colt"" that must be tamed. But that may not the only explanation for Valdes' arrival, said Jose Vicente Carrasquero, professor of political science at the Universidad Simon Bolivar in Caracas, Venezuela. While Valdes may not be an energy man, he does have a background in government purchases, Carrasquero told CNN. Venezuela's alliance with Cuba in areas such as medicine has resulted in a system in which Cuba purchases medical equipment that it in turn sells to Venezuela at a markup, he said. Carrasquero said it is possible that Valdes is coming to do something similar with the energy sector. That is, assess what equipment Venezuela needs to meet its electricity needs and have the Cuban team purchase it and then sell it to Venezuela. The bottom line, he said, is that ""President Chavez's dependence on Cuba is reaching unprecedented levels."" The Venezuelan government said that the Cuban team is simply one of several foreign teams that have been called to help. Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez cited teams from Brazil and Argentina that have already arrived, along with offers of help from Russia and China. As for Valdes and his team, ""They have great expertise on matters of saving electricity and electrical efficiency,"" the minister said, according to the state-run ABN news service. ""They have realized extraordinary work in the replacement of a great quantity of very inefficient equipment, pushing forth an energy revolution where they changed all of the incandescent light bulbs for energy-saving bulbs."" The Cubans also came up with an electrical grid that divides the country into rings, so that problems in one area won't affect other areas, Rodriguez said. In all, the Venezuelan government will invest more than $4 billion to fix the electricity problems, he said. Calls to Venezuelan authorities for further comment on the appointment of Valdes were not immediately returned.","Ramiro Valdes, 77, is one of only four remaining original rebels led by Fidel Castro in the 1950s .

"(CNN) -- ""My Fair Wedding"" host David Tutera and his soon-to-be ex-husband are raising eyebrows by choosing to raise their twin children separately. Tutera's ex, Ryan Jurica, discussed the controversial decision for the first time on HLN's Now In America. ""I still feel like I lost a daughter,"" said Jurica. ""I hope the kids can be in each other's lives as much as possible, and that's what I'm working hard to do."" Tutera and Jurica were united in a civil union in Vermont in September 2003. About three years ago, they decided to have children through a surrogate, but by the time the babies were born, the couple had split up. After the two ended their relationship earlier this year, they reached a temporary custody agreement to raise their 2-month-old twins, a boy named Cedric and a girl named Cielo, separately. Although the divorce isn't final, the couple has decided Jurica will raise his biological child, Cedric, and Tutera will raise his biological child, Cielo. Tutera appeared on ""The View"" last week and announced the couple's decision. ""We transferred two embryos into the surrogate: One was biologically mine, my daughter, Cielo. One was biologically his, his son,"" he explained. Jurica said it was Tutera's decision to split up the children, and he's still sad that this is the solution they've reached. Jurica said the idea came up when the two separated and Tutera told him, ""We know the boy is yours and the girl is mine. You can have your son and I can have my daughter, and we can move on with our lives."" Going forward, Jurica said, he plans to explain everything to his son as soon as he's mature enough to understand the situation. ""I plan to tell Cedric everything. I think honesty is the only way to live,"" he said. ""Obviously it will have to wait until he's old enough. It's a complex and complicated story, both how he came into this world and my past and my divorce, so it's a lot to talk about."" HLN contacted Tutera for a response, but he declined to comment.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- India's air force geared up for possible missions against suspected terrorist camps in Pakistan in the immediate aftermath of November's Mumbai attacks, U.S. military officials told CNN Monday. One U.S. official said India's air force ""went on alert"" after the attacks in Mumbai. Pakistan said it would defend itself if attacked. ""We don't want to go to war,"" Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Gilani announced during a speech at the National Assembly on Monday. ""But if the war is thrust on us, we will stand united like a respectful nation."" While the officials characterized the Indian actions as preliminary preparations to position the air force if strikes were ordered, the comments indicate that the two nuclear powers were perhaps closer to conflict than previously acknowledged. Three Pentagon officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, have individually confirmed to CNN that the United States has information indicating that India began to prepare air force personnel for a possible mission. The officials offered few details, but one said India's air force ""went on alert."" A second official said the United States concluded these preliminary preparations would put India in a position to move swiftly against suspected terrorist camps and targets inside Pakistan, before adding that a number of senior U.S. officials urged India to exercise restraint during this time. An Indian air force official had no comment. CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported last week that the air force had been put on its highest level of readiness and that the aircraft had been armed. ""We are certainly against terrorism, but that doesn't mean that we go at war with any country,"" Indian Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major told CNN-IBN Thursday, adding that any decision on military action would be ""up to the government because the air force and the army are there only to carry out the will of the government."" Air Commodore Homayoon Ziqar, a spokesman for the Pakistani air force, told CNN that Pakistan is not on heightened alert at the moment. ""Everything is normal,"" he said. Another source in Pakistan's military also said the air force is not on heightened alert, but added, ""We are always ready, on weekends, on holidays, no matter what the circumstances."" Since the Mumbai attacks, Pakistani security forces raided a camp near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, according to military sources. It was the first sign of government action against Lashkar-e-Tayyiba since the Mumbai attacks. India says the Pakistan-based Islamic militant group was behind the killings of more than 160 people in Mumbai.  Watch Miss Pakistan talk about the Mumbai attacks » . Also, Pakistani authorities have banned a charity linked to last month's attacks and placed its leader under house arrest. The move came after the U.N. Security Council designated the charity, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a terror organization because of its links to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Gilani's promise that Pakistan would defend itself came amid mounting international pressure for him to crack down on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said he was ""encouraged"" that Pakistan arrested two of the group's top leaders last week, saying it amounted to the first steps toward determining who plotted the Mumbai siege. Indian police say the only surviving suspect from the Mumbai attacks, identified by Indian authorities as 21-year-old Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, is from Pakistan's Punjab province and the other nine attackers also were from Pakistan. Pakistani officials have denied that assertion, blaming instead ""stateless actors."" Until now, the Bush Administration has publicly said it saw no signs of military movement by India and no indication that the Indian government was preparing any type of retaliation. The Pentagon officials broadly described the activity as checking the status of crews, fighter jets and weapons that were available. The extent of the reported preparation was not immediately known. Also, one of the Pentagon officials confirmed that the United States has intelligence indicating a single Indian aircraft violated Pakistani airspace twice on Saturday. The United States believes the incursion was inadvertent, the official said, adding that there is no information to indicate it was planned. Meanwhile, suspected U.S. missile strikes continued to hammer Pakistan's tribal region, killing three people in a North Waziristan village Monday evening, according to a Pakistani military official. Monday's strike is the 29th suspected U.S. missile strike in Pakistan this year.

"(CNN) -- The Casey Anthony murder trial ended an hour and a half early Thursday, with Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. telling members of the media in the courtroom that Anthony was ill. Jurors were not told why the trial ended early Thursday, and Perry asked them not to speculate. He said court would be in recess until Friday. After the jurors left, Perry spoke to members of the media in the courtroom, saying that Anthony was ill and that neither the prosecution nor the defense had any comment on the matter. The judge asked reporters not to question either side about it. The details of Anthony's illness were not given. During a short break before the announcement, Anthony drank a bottle of water quietly as attorneys spoke together and went back to Perry's chambers, according to In Session's Michael Christian. She was escorted out of the courtroom during the break, then brought back in, but lay her head down on her arms at the defense table. She did not stand as the jurors left the courtroom. In a statement released Thursday evening, Orange County Jail spokesman, Allen Moore said Anthony had been returned to jail and was receiving medical attention from the facility's health services provider. ""No information can be released regarding her treatment or medical condition due to HIPPA and Florida Medical and Mental Health Confidentiality Laws,"" Moore said. For security reasons, Moore also declined to state whether Anthony would return to court Friday. ""Orange County Corrections will never reveal the transport of any inmate in our custody due to the security risks posed by such knowledge being made public,"" Moore said. Earlier Thursday, testimony centered on the recovery of the skeletal remains of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, from a wooded area in December 2008. Anthony cried as photographs of the remains were displayed in the Orlando courtroom and avoided looking at the screen where they were displayed. Anthony, 25, faces seven counts in Caylee's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. The toddler's family last saw her on June 16, 2008, but no one alerted police until July 15, when the girl's maternal grandmother tracked down Casey Anthony and demanded answers. Prosecutors allege Casey Anthony used chloroform on her daughter and suffocated her by putting duct tape over the little girl's mouth and nose. They allege she put her daughter's body in her car trunk before disposing of it. Caylee's skeletal remains were found on December 11, 2008, less than a mile from the home of Casey Anthony's parents. Casey Anthony has pleaded not guilty and denied having anything to do with her daughter's death.  Defense attorney Jose Baez has said that when all the facts are known, it will become clear his client is innocent. As the photographs were displayed Thursday, jurors heard testimony from Orange County Sheriff's Office crime scene technician Jennifer Welch, along with Steve Hanson, chief investigator for the medical examiner's office, and Gary Utz, Orange County chief deputy . Welch detailed items found with the little girl's remains, including a black plastic bag, an off-white canvas bag, a red plastic Disney bag, a pair of shorts, a blanket and ""clothing remnants."" Duct tape could be seen on the facial region of the skull, she testified. Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, were not in the courtroom while the photos were shown Thursday. Jurors also heard a recording of a 911 call in which a utility worker reported that meter reader Roy Kronk claimed to have found a skull at the site where the remains were found. Questioned by Baez, Welch agreed that it was paramount that a crime scene or remains not be tampered with, saying it could affect an investigation. Numerous photographs were introduced into evidence of the skull, along with the duct tape on it and other items found at the scene, such as the canvas laundry bag. Utz testified the skull had its jawbone, or mandible, still attached, which was relatively rare given the stage of decomposition. The duct tape, he testified, was helping keep the jawbone attached, along with hair on the skull. Thursday morning, jurors heard testimony from Casey Anthony's brother, who testified that his sister -- out of jail on bail the month after Caylee was reported missing -- told him an alternate version of how the little girl was kidnapped by her nanny. He said his sister told him in August 2008 that she had met the nanny, Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, at an Orlando park along with Gonzalez's sister. Casey Anthony told him that Gonzalez held her down and told her that she was taking Caylee from her because she wasn't a good mother, ""to teach her a lesson,"" Lee Anthony said. Gonzalez also warned her not to go to the police, according to Casey Anthony's account. Lee Anthony recalled his sister saying, ""she couldn't believe it was happening, and it felt kind of surreal to her,"" he testified. She said she did nothing to stop her child from being taken, he recounted, because ""she was scared and she didn't know what to do."" His sister told him that, from time to time, Gonzalez would contact her through Casey Anthony's MySpace page and direct her as to what to do and where to go. She went to the locations, she said, in hopes of seeing or retrieving her daughter but was never successful in finding her. Casey Anthony's account, as related by Lee Anthony, differed markedly from the one she gave authorities after Caylee was reported missing. She maintained to police she dropped the child off at the nanny's apartment that morning and never saw her again. Authorities were never able to find the nanny. They did find a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez, who denied ever meeting Casey Anthony or Caylee and later sued for defamation. ""Zanny never materialized?"" Baez asked Lee Anthony Thursday. ""To this day, no,"" he replied. Lee Anthony also testified Thursday that he was the one searching the Internet on the Anthony family computer July 15 and 16, 2008. A computer examiner testified Wednesday that no searches for Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez were found on the computer until July 16 -- dealing a potential blow to Casey Anthony's claims to authorities that she was frantically searching for her daughter in the month before her disappearance was reported. Computer experts testified Wednesday that in March, someone using the desktop computer, located in the home Casey Anthony shared with her parents, searched for terms including ""chloroform,"" ""inhalation,"" ""how to make chloroform"" and ""head injury."" The searches were found in a portion of the computer's hard drive that indicated they had been deleted, Detective Sandra Osborne of the Orange County Sheriff's Office testified Wednesday. However, she told jurors, deleted material remains on a computer's hard drive and can be retrieved until it is overwritten by new data. It had not been overwritten on the Anthonys' computer, she said, and ""a complete Internet history"" was obtained. It appears the computer user first searched for ""chloraform"" on Google and received results for ""chloroform,"" said John Bradley, owner of the software development company that created the software used to retrieve the data. One of the search results was from Wikipedia.org, which was accessed, he testified. On the other terms, he said the user either typed those terms in to search, or in some instances may have clicked on hyperlinks on the Wikipedia site. Bradley agreed with Baez's assertion that the links do not tell jurors what was on the websites accessed, and that some sites could have been jokes or information on self-defense. He also agreed he could not say how closely the user was examining the websites or whether a user was looking at multiple browsers. There were two user-created profiles on the computer, but Osborne told Baez she could not tell who performed the searches. Despite her assertions, prosecutors allege Casey Anthony was not looking for her missing daughter during the month before police were notified of her disappearance. Anthony's former boyfriend, friends and acquaintances who saw her during that time recalled her shopping, eating out, going to parties and hitting nightclubs, but all of them testified she never mentioned her missing daughter and none of them noticed any change in her demeanor. Her mother testified that Anthony had moved out of her parents' home about the time Caylee went missing, offering little in the way of explanation, and that when she inquired after Caylee, she was told Caylee was with her nanny, Gonzalez. Earlier in the week, jurors heard testimony regarding a foul odor emanating from Casey Anthony's trunk. A scientist testified that compounds associated with human decomposition were found there, and a cadaver dog handler testified that his dog ""alerted"" to the trunk.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Protesters in Egypt, rowdy with revolutionary fervor, dug in for an 18th day of demonstrations Friday, one day after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak refused to step down. In a highly anticipated speech, Mubarak clung to the presidency but said he would ""delegate powers"" to Vice President Omar Suleiman according to the constitution -- a major concession from the man who has ruled Egypt with an iron grip for 30 years. His speech, however, enraged protesters in Tahrir Square, who want Mubarak to leave now. Packed in like sardines and showing no sign of giving up, many said they were spending the night in the square for the first time since the protests began. The mood of the crowd was relentlessly upbeat, even at 3 a.m.. A splinter group of demonstrators marched to the presidential palace, where the military maintains a strong presence. Another group rallied in front of a state television building. Massive street demonstrations are expected on Friday. ""Get out! Get out!"" angry protesters chanted as Mubarak spoke. After the the president's speech,parliamentary speaker Ahmed Fathi Srour told state-run Nile TV that Mubarak's move had put the authority for the day-to-day running of the government in Suleiman's hands. That would include oversight of the police, the Interior Ministry and other key agencies, control of economic policy and running any negotiations with the opposition. Srour echoed Mubarak's statement in adding that the constitution specifically prohibits the president from delegating other key powers to the vice president. As a result, the power to dismiss parliament or dismiss the government and the power to ask for amendments to the constitution remain in Mubarak's hands, not Suleiman's. ""The vice president is the de facto president,"" Egypt's ambassador to the United States, Sameh Shoukry, told CNN, shortly after Mubarak spoke. Protesters watched Mubarak's speech on screens hoisted above their heads in Tahrir Square. Quiet at first, they waited to hear what he would say. When it became clear the president would not stand down, they erupted. ""Illegitimate!"" they cried. ""Mubarak, the coward, must stand down!"" ""Everyone's lost,"" Khalid Abdalla, a demonstrator in the square and star of the motion picture ""The Kite Runner,"" said after the president's speech. ""People are trying to work out what more they can do."" Mubarak stressed -- as he has before -- that he would not run for another term in September. He also expressed regret for any loss of life and said he would move to repeal Article 179 of the Egyptian constitution, which allows Mubarak to send anyone suspected of terrorism to a military court, ""as soon as we regain stability and security."" His comments came as pressure on Mubarak's regime intensified throughout the day. Rumors had run rampant before he spoke that Mubarak was planning to step down. Many also had predicted he would deputize Suleiman, the former intelligence chief, to take control. For that to happen under the current constitution, Mubarak must retain the title of president -- as he did. Suleiman addressed the nation soon after Mubarak, urging Egyptians to remain calm and go back to work. He said he was committed to doing ""whatever it takes in order to have an orderly transition of powers in accordance with the provisions of the constitution."" ""Go back to your houses. Go back to your work. The homeland needs your work,"" Suleiman said. Mubarak's refusal to step down caught the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama off guard, a senior U.S. official told CNN. ""Not what we were told would happen and not what we wanted to happen,"" the official, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, said of the speech. Obama released a statement late Thursday, calling on the Egyptian government to do more. ""The Egyptian people have been told that there was a transition of authority, but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate, meaningful or sufficient,"" he said. ""Too many Egyptians remain unconvinced that the government is serious about a genuine transition to democracy, and it is the responsibility of the government to speak clearly to the Egyptian people and the world."" The mass demonstrations, despite stern government warnings of military intervention, were relentless Thursday, and thousands of workers in vital industries walked off their jobs in a show of solidarity with demonstrators demanding change. In their strongest maneuver yet, the military's senior officers Thursday issued ""Communique No. 1,"" as if more were forthcoming, stating that their discussions were ongoing on ""what can be achieved to preserve the homeland and the gains of the Egyptian people."" The military remained out in force throughout the day, and many believe Egypt's future hinges on the role it will play. ""Egypt will explode. Army must save the country now,"" Mohamed ElBaradei, an opposition leader, posted on his Twitter page soon after Mubarak spoke. Similarly, Yaser Fathi, one of the organizers of protests in Alexandria, said the military must intervene and push to get Mubarak out. ""Everyone in Egypt is disappointed ... We were hoping that it was almost over, but we will continue until the whole regime gets toppled,"" he said. Exactly what role the military will play, however, remained unclear. ""This now creates a massive crisis for the Egyptian military,"" analysts with Stratfor global intelligence company said in a statement, soon after Mubarak's speech. ""As dawn breaks over Cairo, it is likely that large numbers of others will join the demonstrators and that the crowd might begin to move. The military would then be forced to stand back and let events go where they go, or fire on the demonstrators,"" the analysts said. Earlier Thursday, protesting lawyers toppled barricades near Abdeen Palace, the former home of Egypt's monarchy and a symbol of power. Armed police, who had disappeared from the streets of Cairo as the uprising gained momentum, waited behind metal fences. But the police fled and the crowd surged amid the roar of thunder on a rainy day. ""God is great,"" they chanted. Unable to enter the palace, which was under heavy army protection, the group of lawyers headed to Tahrir Square, where massive crowds again gathered to call for the immediate departure of Mubarak. The demonstrations were galvanized earlier in the week by the words and tears of freed cyberactivist Wael Ghonim, who emerged as a reluctant hero of Egypt's uprising. Ghonim, on leave from his marketing job with the search engine Google in Dubai, was seized by security forces and held for 10 days before being released. He is credited with starting a Facebook page that triggered the protests. Mubarak's foes were re-energized again Thursday by strikes called by petroleum, railway and telecommunications employees seeking better compensation. Oil workers demanded transparency in executive salaries, said Hamdi Abdel-Aziz, a spokesman for the petroleum ministry. National Railway Council employees called for longer contracts, prompting a pledge to extend them from their leaders. Some did not return to work Thursday, said Mostafa Qinawi, head of the Railway Council. Employees of the steel industry and the Suez Canal Port Authority also took to the streets to demand better salaries, said the state-run al-Ahram newspaper. That sparked fears that the Suez Canal -- a significant oil transport hub and major revenue source for Egypt -- would shut down and send oil prices skyrocketing. Egypt's finance minister said the nation will ""do its utmost best"" to ensure the canal remains open. ""All precautions are taken to prevent any sabotage from outside to the Suez Canal,"" Samir Hadwan told CNN. ""The Suez Canal is safe and the Egyptian Army -- I don't talk on their behalf -- but I can assure you it will do whatever is in its power to keep that open."" In the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, Egypt's second largest, street cleaners and administrative staff went on strike over what they say is a salary freeze. At least 1,000 engineers protested contracts and financial compensations, officials said. Thursday's demonstrations unfolded with vigor despite escalating fears of a government crackdown. Key government officials have sought to portray an immediate departure for Mubarak as a recipe for absolute mayhem and warned of military intervention. Human Rights Watch has been deeply critical of the government's handling of the crisis. ""Mubarak's speech is far from the needed break with the abusive system of the past 30 years,"" Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Thursday. ""Cosmetic changes are not enough to meet the Egyptian people's demands for democracy and human rights."" The monitoring group has documented 302 deaths since the January 25 rally that ignited Egypt's revolt.

"(CNN) -- A California jury on Wednesday found the Los Angeles Dodgers negligent in a civil lawsuit related to the beating of San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow following a 2011 baseball game. The same jury did not find the Dodgers then-owner, Frank McCourt, negligent in the case. Earlier this year, two California men pleaded guilty for their roles in Stow's beating. Marvin Norwood and Louie Sanchez were sentenced to four years and eight years, respectively. Wednesday's verdict was in a civil case. The jury found the Dodgers organization 25% responsible for Stow's injuries, while Sanchez and Norwood were each found 37.5% responsible. It is not yet clear whether there will be an appeal. The lawsuit sought a total of $50 million to cover Stow's medical costs for him and his two children. If the decision is upheld, Stow would -- in theory -- receive just short of $18 million in damages total. In practice, the amount will be around $15 million, his lawyer told reporters. ""That's going to go a long way to helping Bryan,"" said Stow's attorney, Thomas Girardi. He explained the breakdown: . ""All the medical expenses in the past, all the future medical expenses, all the past loss of earnings and all the future loss of earnings, which is about say $14 million, just in rough terms, the Dodgers ... they have to pay all of that. Then, with respect to the pain and suffering -- about $4 million or so -- they only have to pay 25% of that,"" he said. The remainder of the settlement, Girardi said, would be paid by Norwood and Sanchez. But since they don't have that kind of money, Stow -- realistically -- will get some $15 million,Girardi said. The lawsuit contends the Dodgers and former owner Frank McCourt did not provide enough lighting and security in the stadium parking lot the night Stow was beaten. Lawyers for the Dodgers and McCourt argued that their clients acted reasonably, and that Stow was intoxicated and aggressive before the assault. Stow appeared at the trial several times in a wheelchair. Man convicted in Dodgers beating case arrested on gun charge .

"(CNN) -- The sense that a deadly tragedy could get worse hangs over the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Scattered bodies, ripped-apart suitcases and charred books testify that 298 people died Thursday when the airplane fell from 30,000 feet to the grassy fields of an almost-lawless section of eastern Ukraine. More than 24 hours after the crash, the bodies lay there untouched, with nobody able to say who's in charge and whether the dead would ever be treated with dignity. ""It basically looks like the biggest crime scene in the world right now, guarded by a bunch of guys in uniform with heavy firepower who are quite inhospitable,"" Michael Bociurkiw, spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe team, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The bodies are starting to decompose in the Ukraine summer heat, the stink mixing with the charred odor coming from the wreckage. Surrealistic signs of death carpet the countryside. Some on the Malaysia-bound plane were dressed in sandals, shorts and other clothes people wear on a tropical vacation, said Noah Sneider, a freelance journalist who visited the crash site. At one spot he noticed a printout of the top 10 tourist tips for people visiting Bali. Some passengers, he said, died strapped into their seats wearing headphones, as if listening to music or watching an onboard movie. Emergency workers say they've found more than 170 bodies across a wide area, some caught up in large pieces of the aircraft, others simply lying where they fell. Some bodies are mangled so much it's impossible to say if they're man or woman, others show no marks or injury. In the darkness, it's not hard to stumble across a body. The region is controlled by pro-Russian militants, who gave a rude reception Friday to monitors on the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe team. They were in the region to observe the war and aren't air crash investigators. ""We asked for the commander, the leader,"" Bociurkiw told Amanpour. ""No one showed up. ""There was one gentleman there in a uniform, heavily armed, and apparently somewhat intoxicated who wasn't very hospitable or helpful at all. In fact in the end he kind of rushed all of them away, including the journalists."" Bociurkiw said the team spent only 75 minutes at the crash site and examined only a 200-meter strip before being chased away. In the distance, he heard explosions, a familiar sound in this region ripped apart by war. ""The perimeter is not secure whatsoever,"" Bociurkiw said. ""They seemed to have put some tape up where we were standing, but otherwise it's very easy for anyone, really, to walk in there and tamper with evidence or debris. So a lot of work needs to be done. A lot of professional work, very, very quickly."" In the United States or other Western nations, law enforcement would have put the crash site off limits to the morbidly curious right away. In east Ukraine, reporters walked right up to pieces of wreckage to do stand-up reports. A small crew of emergency workers from the Ukraine government arrived and began working on the scene, but they need more people and resources to properly handle a crash that killed 298 people. They're obviously working with the permission of the militants. At night the groups mingled, seemingly without hostility, and even shared tents. Meanwhile, the world is watching. The clock is ticking. ""It is cool right now,"" Bociurkiw said, ""but if it's a warm day tomorrow, it will continue to turn into quite a messy situation.""

"(CNN) -- Flooding described by India's prime minister as the worst in recent times, has left at least 95 people dead and almost 2 million others homeless in the country's remote Assam state. The Brahmaputra river overflowed during monsoon rains over the past week, flooding more than 2,000 villages and destroying homes in the northeast of the country, officials said. Most of the dead were swept away by the fast-flowing water, while 16 were reported to have been buried by landslides caused by the heavy rains. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told journalists Monday that almost half a million people were living in relief camps, and the remaining of the displaced were staying with relatives or living in the open, using tarpaulin sheets for shelter. Sabir Ali, who lives in one of the affected villages, had to move his family to higher ground with only what they could carry. ""I am stuck. How will I survive? I've been forced to move to railways tracks with my children,"" he told CNN-IBN. But water levels have begun to recede, and thousands have returned to damaged homes. A report issued on Tuesday lowered the number of evacuees to 370,000. Assam's State Disaster Management Authority reported that at least 14 people are missing. The agency reported that flooding had begun as early as June 24 in some areas and affected all of Assam's 27 districts. It is considered the worst flooding the state has seen since 2004. Assam's river island of Majuli experienced its worst flooding since 1950. Prime Minister Singh and Sonia Gandhi of India's ruling Congress party flew over the flooded areas to survey the damage. Singh announced that an initial 5 billion rupees (US$90 million) would be given in emergency funds to help with recovery efforts. ""I have witnessed the extensive damage that the floods have caused. The people of Assam are facing one of the worst floods in recent times,"" Singh said in a prepared statement. After his tour of the affected districts, Singh said military helicopters were dropping food packets and drinking water to marooned people, and soldiers were using speedboats to rescue villages from rooftops. ""Once we have completed rescue and relief operation, our focus will shift to restoration of the damaged infrastructure,"" Singh said. Large swaths of cropland have been affected by the flooding, and a railway line has been severely damaged by landslides. Every year the monsoon dumps heavy rains across India, and every year it claims lives. The total number of deaths throughout India attributed to monsoon season this year has reached 236.

"(CNN) -- It came down to the wire, but one Thanksgiving tradition went off without a hitch. The 16 giant balloons that are a signature of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade floated serenely over Thursday's event in New York. The balloons' use had been in question because of possible high winds, but calmer winds prevailed. New York police, however, asked that the balloons be flown five feet lower than normal, just to be safe. Some worried before the parade that they wouldn't get to see the famous balloons. ""We came all the way from Puerto Rico to see the parade, so it will be a disappointment if we can't see the balloons,"" said Jose Ramirez, who was in New York with his family. The same goes for the Mastandano family. ""They have to fly,"" said Joely Mastandano. ""Somebody has to make them fly."" Parade officials had good reason for being cautious. In 1997, a woman spent more than three weeks in a coma after the Cat in the Hat balloon -- tossed by heavy winds -- struck a pole that hit her. In 2005, two other people were hurt in a similar incident involving the M&Ms balloon. Wind gauges will line the route to make sure it's not too breezy, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. ""We have a sergeant assigned to each of the balloons,"" Kelly said. ""They can be lowered all the way to the ground."" It's Thanksgiving . Forecasters had predicted major delays as people traveled for the annual holiday, but the big, scary storms they spoke of didn't quite materialize. Except for a few areas where heavy snow fell, this week's wintry storm system was more of a nuisance than anything to most Americans. Early reports had us thinking flights would be stranded and roads too slick to travel on, especially in the Northeast. Not quite. Cold weather and blustery winds are the leftovers from this storm. Faring well . Planes and trains fared well as the storm slipped to the north. No major delays were reported. That was good news for people like Latasha Abney, who joined the more than 43 million Americans expected by AAA to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Abney said Wednesday that she arrived more than two hours early at Washington's Reagan National Airport to catch a flight to New York's JFK on Wednesday. ""Security was a breeze,"" she said. ""I walked right up, the TSA agent checked my info ... Happy Thanksgiving!!!!"" #ATL24: A day in the life of the world's busiest airport . Amtrak reported no major delays across its system. Using the weather as a marketing tool, the nation's rail system was adding seats on some routes. ""Rail travel remains one of the most reliable and comfortable transportation options, especially in weather conditions that negatively impact other modes,"" Amtrak said. 5 healthy eating tips for holiday travelers . Deadly roads . Although planes were in the air and trains were on track, automobiles were having a tougher time on the northern fringes of the nation. Up to a foot of snow fell in parts of Pennsylvania, and it was falling from upstate New York into Canada, where more than a foot was possible. Snow also continued to fly in the central Appalachians and around the Great Lakes as cold air moved in and produced lake-effect snows. Road conditions were not great in much of the Northeast. Over the last week, 12 people died, most of them in car crashes, as the storm system iced roads from the Rockies to Texas and Oklahoma. More than 100 vehicles ended up in wrecks. Storm prompts airlines to relax travel policies . Black Friday, or is that Thursday? Travel? Check. Turkey? Check. Now it's time to shop. All the buzz is about Black Friday, at least for serious shoppers. But it's a bit of a misnomer. More and more, Black Friday is becoming Black Thursday. Kmart is the early bird with a 6 a.m. opening, and will stay open 41 straight hours. ""People don't just want to sit at home all day on Thanksgiving. They want to get out and do things, shop,"" said Bill Bonsor, the Kmart store manager in Mableton, Georgia. ""It's just evolved into a bigger shopping day -- almost as big a shopping day as Black Friday."" Other retailers like Toys R Us, Walmart, Macy's, Kohl's, J.C. Penney and Sears wait until Thursday evening to open their doors. Electronics are again popular ""doorbuster"" items. Look for specials on TVs, Kindles, iPads and other tablets. Not wanting to miss out on such deals, some folks had already pitched tents outside the Best Buy in Burbank, California, on Wednesday. ""It's mainly for the experience,"" said Gabbie Slayton.

"(CNN) -- When freelance journalist Steven Sotloff disappeared during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2013, his family kept the news a secret. Families of hostages are frequently advised to do this by security firms, and news organizations are sometimes willing to cooperate. But Sotloff's abduction is now international news. Sotloff is seen at the end of a video published on Tuesday by the Islamic extremist group ISIS. After another journalist, James Foley, is shown with his head cut off, the video's narrator indicates that Sotloff will be killed if President Barack Obama does not cease U.S. airstrikes against ISIS. ""I've known Steve was missing for the past year -- the problem is, he was a low-profile freelance journalist -- his family didn't want anyone in the media talking about Steve because they were afraid of retaliation,"" said Emerson Lotzia, who lived with Sotloff in college. ""If any old friends asked me about Steve over the past year, I'd just say I hadn't seen him in a long time."" Sotloff's family members have not commented on their son's disappearance. But Lotzia said he has been in touch with Sotloff's father, Art, and Tuesday's video ""was the first time his dad and family have heard anything about Steve since last December."" Out of public view, the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloff's release for the past year. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, who represents the district where the family lives, said Wednesday that she had met with the family in Miami and spoken with them by phone. ""My office has contacted the relevant agencies, departments and even organizations with connections on the ground in Syria to try to get answers for the Sotloff family,"" Ros-Lehtinen said. This is a tragic situation and we have seen that [ISIS] has no respect for human life."" Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami."" Lotzia met Sotloff when they were both starting college in 2002. He described Sotloff as ""someone you want in your circle of friends -- just a good, good guy."" He reminisced about ""epic video game battles at our apartment"" -- usually NCAA football or other sports games. In 2004, Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area. ""I think he was at a crossroads of life,"" Lotzia said. ""He talked about wanting to go over to the Middle East."" He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey -- among other countries -- and eventually Syria. ""He's an incredible writer,"" said Tim Smith, another college friend who kept in touch with him via Facebook over the years. ""I know reporting on an international level is what he always wanted to do."" Ashley Burns, who edited some of Sotloff's work for their college newspaper, said that out of all the people he met through the newspaper, he wished he had followed Sotloff's work more in recent years. ""He writes with incredible passion, about Benghazi and his experiences in Syria and Turkey, while showing an incredible relationship with -- and understanding of -- the people that he met in the countries that he has worked in,"" Burns said. ""He has seen things I'll never see and his courage is incredible.""","Steven Sotloff's family and friends had to keep his disappearance a secret .

"(CNN) -- As the world struggles to come to terms with the horror of another passenger jet falling from the skies, the full picture of how and why Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 came down over eastern Ukraine is far from clear. The United States believes a surface-to-air missile brought the Boeing 777 down over territory held by pro-Russian separatists but hasn't indicated who's responsible -- though both sides in the ongoing civil conflict in Ukraine blame each other. According to a top Ukrainian official, the airliner, which was en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam with nearly 300 people on board, was flying at about 10,000 meters (nearly 33,000 feet) over the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine when the missile hit. A number of airlines have since re-routed services away from the region, prompting questions about whether commercial aircraft should be anywhere near conflict zones anyway. ""Was this an accident waiting to happen for any airliner flying over that part of the Ukraine -- and there were plenty of them?"" asked CNN aviation expert Richard Quest. ""Although there had been restrictions over Crimea, in this part of Ukraine there are no restrictions. The space between the ground and 32,000 feet had been closed by the Ukrainians. Above 32,000 feet it was open. This plane was not doing anything wrong being where it was. ""We can argue whether restrictions should have been in place with everything going on there, but when that pilot flew that route ... there was nothing wrong with doing so."" ""That part of Ukraine is essentially ungoverned space, and when you have ungoverned space you have these kinds of calamities,"" said retired U.S. Army major general and CNN military analyst James ""Spider"" Marks. ""Sadly, we should not be surprised by this."" Russian weapon . ""We don't know who had their finger on the trigger, but clearly this is Russian kit, whether in Ukrainian hands or in Russian,"" he added. Analysts believe this ""kit"" could be a Buk missile system. Known as the SA-11 among NATO forces, it was developed by the Soviets and operated by both Russian and Ukrainian forces, according to retired Brig. Gen. Kevin Ryan, director of the Defense and Intelligence Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. As to where the order came from, Marks suggested air defense units could be operating without central control. ""It could be an independent process,"" he said. ""That means individual operators of that launcher or mobile air defense system can engage targets at will based on certain profiles -- they see an aircraft, its altitude, it doesn't transpond in a way they can figure out, so their initial reading is that it's military and they fire because they have the authority. What you'd prefer to have is some back-up systems, but that was clearly not the case here."" Investigation worry . With much of the wreckage believed to be in territory held by separatists near the Russian border, there's concern that international inspectors may not be granted access to conduct a proper investigation before the crash site is ""contaminated"" or tampered with. ""Ultimately, the international community is going to demand that there is a proper, full investigation,"" said Quest. Matthew L. Wald, a reporter with the New York Times, told CNN it was important to bring in a skilled investigator to look for clues in the wreckage. ""What you look for in a 'shoot down' or explosion is the condition of the metal. Are there shrapnel holes? Are their entry wounds and exit wounds -- something that went through the airframe? Are there bends in the metal characteristic of high explosives? If someone skilled can find it, they'll be able to make a diagnosis."" Cockpit clue . He said the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder could also provide vital clues if they survived a possible blast. ""You might catch conversations between the crew. This has happened before in airplanes that were shot down, where it's clear pilots were talking to each other about damage to the plane. They know what's happened and that would makes things clearer,"" said Wald. ""There's no reason why we shouldn't get the recorders,"" added Quest. ""Yes, there was a very violent fire and a very violent crash, but this thing is designed for this."" Yet it's by no means certain that outside assistance will be permitted inside such a volatile area. However, Wald says that there is a precedent for data recovery. ""When the Soviets shot down Korean Airlines Flight 007 (in 1983) ... they said they'd recovered nothing. ""The father of a young college student was on that plane. Hans Ephraimson-Abt went to Moscow, went to (President) Gorbachev and brought back the black box -- and that cockpit voice recorder told a lot."" The friends and relatives of Flight 17 will be hoping they will be spared the anguish of not knowing too.","The United States believes a surface-to-air missile brought Malaysia Airlines jet down .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. journalist missing in Syria for nearly six months is most likely in Syrian government custody, according to the GlobalPost, an online international news outlet, and the man's brother. Gunmen kidnapped James Foley on November 22 and his family has since worked to obtain his release. Foley, a free-lance journalist, contributed stories to the GlobalPost. According to a GlobalPost story on Friday, its CEO and president, Philip Balboni, said in a speech marking World Press Freedom Day that the outlet has a ""very high degree of confidence"" that Foley was ""most likely abducted by a pro-regime militia group and turned over to Syrian government forces."" ""We have obtained multiple independent reports from very credible confidential sources who have both indirect and direct access that confirm our assessment that Jim is now being held by the Syrian government in a prison or detention facility in the Damascus area,"" Balboni said. ""We further believe that this facility is under the control of the Syrian Air Force Intelligence service. Based on what we have learned, it is likely Jim is being held with one or more Western journalists, including most likely at least one other American."" Another American journalist, Austin Tice, also is missing in Syria. READ MORE: Missing American journalist's parents: Send our son home from Syria for Christmas .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius first gained international fame amid a raging debate over whether his prosthetic legs would give him a competitive advantage in the 2012 Summer Olympics. Today, the disabled track star finds himself in the middle of a more serious controversy: whether he intentionally shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, or whether he mistook her for an intruder. Pistorius has been charged with premeditated murder and his trial is sure to provoke worldwide news coverage (no date has been set yet). The South African athlete's spectacular fall from grace shocked many who were inspired by his remarkable story of overcoming adversity to become an Olympian and a national hero. But not everyone. ""Here, I think, you had a troubled athlete,"" said South African sports journalist Graeme Joffe. ""Not so much this incredible role model for the rest of the world -- no question about that -- but deep down, this was a troubled athlete."" Pistorius case brings South Africa gun culture to global spotlight . Joffe is one of the few South African journalists who has been critical of Pistorius. He said the PR machine behind the man they call Blade Runner has all but made him untouchable. ""So many incidents have happened and they've been well documented over the last five or six years with Oscar Pistorius,"" said Joffe, who worked at CNN in the 1990s. ""These kinds of cases have disappeared."" The South African media has long adored Pistorius, some would say even protected him, by minimizing his problems. Yet, some of his friends and colleagues have cast doubt on the idyllic image of Pistorius portrayed by the press. ""It's like we were waiting for something like this to happen,"" said Marc Batchelor, a South African soccer player who socialized with Pistorius in South Africa's glamor and sports circles. Batchelor described Pistorius as someone who ""had a trip switch,"" quick to get angry and fight. Pistorius caused ""a lot of problems,"" he said. Uncle: Victim's family won't attend Pistorius trial . Batchelor said Pistorius once wanted to fight him because the track star thought his girlfriend was cheating on him. Pistorius, who Batchelor described as drunk, started yelling and swearing over the phone. ""He said he's not scared. If I want to come down there, he knows where I am, and blah blah blah. But I left it,"" Batchelor told CNN. One thing many people don't know, Batchelor said, is that Pistorius was armed nearly everywhere he went. He even applied to become a licensed gun collector so he could buy more guns than the four that South Africans are allowed, according to Carvel Webb, chairman of an umbrella organization for South Africa's private gun collectors, including Pistorius. Just last January -- though the facts are in dispute -- Pistorius' friend and boxer Kevin Lerena said the track star was holding a gun at an outdoor cafÃ© when it went off. Lerena said Pistorius was showing the gun to a friend. ""That was a major mistake what happened from Oscar's part, it wasn't intentional,"" Lerena told CNN's Piers Morgan last month. ""And that also could have been a very bad event and something that could have been very tragic. We are all very fortunate that day. And after that event, Oscar was very apologetic."" Lerena said the incident was purely an accident. ""That's how dangerous guns can be,"" he said. ""But by no means did I think he was negligent with the gun."" Pistorius' dad triggers gun controversy . There are no police records of the incident, and CNN could not get a comment from the restaurant. And when questions were asked in the media, an unidentified Pistorius friend said it was he who brought the gun to the restaurant, not Pistorius. Pistorius crossed paths with authorities in February 2009 when the sprinter said he was nearly killed when the speedboat he was driving hit a submerged object. He was airlifted to a hospital and underwent facial reconstruction surgery. Yet, at the time, doctors downplayed the injuries as minor. Three days later, local news reported police found alcohol bottles inside the submerged boat. ""We are investigating the possibility that the consumption of alcohol had played a role in the boating accident,"" said police spokeswoman Maria Mazibuko. Opinion: Why brutality is ingrained in psyche of South Africa . The next day the spokeswoman said she was misquoted, and even said police could not confirm Pistorius was the driver. And Pistorius' manager strongly condemned the report: . ""That's the problem with South African media. They don't get their facts [straight] and they love to speculate,"" Van Zyl said. Police eventually dropped their negligent driving charge against Pistorius. CNN has repeatedly asked the Pistorius family and his lawyers for comment but has been told there would be none. He is next due in court on June 4. Former Pistorius detective off police force . The police have refused to discuss any part of their investigation. CNN also attempted to reach other friends, colleagues and associates of Pistorius, but all have withheld comment on their relationships with him. There's little doubt that Pistorius' character and his previous run-in with authorities will be key issues brought up by prosecutors during his trial. In the meantime, Pistorius has been released on bail and awaits his fate at his uncle's multimillion-dollar mansion in Pretoria, South Africa. He's no longer required to visit police twice a week under the terms of his bail. Instead authorities will now visit him at his uncle's -- and only occasionally. However his critics viewed him, even the friends who criticized Pistorius' actions defended him. ""He was a good guy,"" Lerena said, ""could have fun with his mates ... but never was he reckless and ever in my company aggressive toward anyone."" Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"(CNN) -- The Philippines' first major typhoon of the season has churned across the country, passing close to the sprawling capital Manila on Wednesday and killing at least 38 people. Typhoon Rammasun made landfall near Legazpi City on the country's east coast late Tuesday. The typhoon, known locally as ""Glenda,"" prompted the evacuations of as many as 350,000 people from their homes in towns and cities across the country. Maria Ressa, Editor in Chief of the online news agency Rappler in Manila, said Wednesday morning that conditions in the city were extreme, with howling winds and strong rain. Several roofs had been ripped off by powerful winds. At about midnight Tuesday, the government announced one casualty -- a person killed by an electrical post that was uprooted. 37 other deaths, including a family of three in Lucena city, Quezon province, were announced by the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC). The Council added that there were ten people injured, and eight remained missing. The closest the eye of the storm got to Manila was about 25 km south of the city around 7 a.m. Wednesday (7 p.m Tuesday ET). 84% of the Metro area now has power restored. Concerns about flooding, landslides . Fears over storm surges eased as the typhoon began to move away from the city, weakening from a Category 2 storm to a Category 1, with maximum sustained winds of about 150 kilometers per hour. But concerns remained about the knock-on effects of the rain, including flooding and landslides. Marco Savio of Plan International spoke to CNN from Makati, Manila's business district early Wednesday morning. He said that, at that time, more than an inch of rain was falling per hour in the city, many areas of which are susceptible to flooding. ""(The) majority are living in areas prone to floods. Schools are closed, offices and buildings (are) closed."" According to a statement from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the typhoon was expected to affect 43 million people spread across 22 provinces. Around 136,000 households within the affected area are in places highly susceptible to landslides and storm surge. Half of these households, the statement adds, about 342,200 people, are poor. Evacuations have taken place in vulnerable areas on a needs basis. The NDRRMC said that over 7,000 homes were completely destroyed, and almost 20,000 more damaged. Infrastructure also suffered, with 15 roads and four bridges becoming impassable. ""A Task Force from the humanitarian community was set up to agree on additional measures to enhance our readiness to respond and remains on standby,"" UNOCHA Humanitarian Coordinator Luiza Carvalho said. Worst over for landfall city . As the storm passed Legazpi, James Reynolds, a freelance videographer who spent the night in the city, ventured out and saw what he described as a ""community effort"" to clear the fallen trees and power lines, and repair some of the property damage. ""The buildings made of solid concrete are OK, but a lot of buildings, windows have been blown out, doors blown out and some of the lighter structures that people live in haven't fared so well but generally its not as bad as it could have been"" he told CNN. The storm significantly intensified just before landfall into a much stronger system. It was expected to be of Category 2 strength but upon hitting land turned into a Category 3 storm, with sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour. It lost strength as it moved across the island of Luzon. ""People in this region have really been on edge since the events of Haiyan,"" Reynolds said. ""The problem with this storm is that it seems to have caught a lot of people off guard."" As the typhoon passed, he said that the anticipated storm surge in Legazpi ""hadn't been an issue."" The storm cut across the main island of the Philippines, hitting numerous population centers across southern and central Luzon. 11 provinces lost power although some were cut off for precautionary measures. The Philippines is hit by an average of eight or nine storms a year. Rammasun is the first to hit since last year's Typhoon Haiyan killed more than 6,250 people, left more than 1,000 missing and caused widespread destruction. Rammasun heads towards China . As the storm continues on past the Philippines, conditions over the South China Sea favor intensification. The storm could be a Category 3 as it gains strength over the sea and nears southern China. The storm is expected to brush the northern part of the Chinese island of Hainan on Friday evening local time (Friday morning ET) as a strong typhoon, likely still a Category 3.

"(CNN) -- Given the privacy concerns swirling around much of our digital activity these days, the idea of handing over one's fingerprints to Apple via its new iPhone 5S has some people nervous. The phone, which goes on sale September 20, will feature a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. Users must ""register"" their print with the device, after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button. The idea is that fingerprints, being unique to each person, augment users' passcodes to offer an additional safeguard against hackers or thieves. But can we trust Apple or its partners with our fingerprints? And couldn't hackers, those resourceful and relentless probers of digital firewalls, find new ways to trick the phone's sensor? The answers, experts say, appear to be: 1) Probably, at least for now, and 2) Yes, although that's unlikely. ""There should always be some concern with new technologies or functionality that has such a large base of users,"" says Joe Schumacher, a consultant for security firm Neohapsis, in an e-mail to CNN. ""The fingerprint reader is more of a sales tactic than a strong security enhancement. ""What still needs to be researched is how this digital fingerprint can be used once it is leaked, hacked or opened up to iCloud."" Prints in the cloud? Some observers have wondered aloud on Twitter and elsewhere whether Apple, armed with a potential database of millions of thumbprints, might turn over some customers' prints to the National Security Agency (NSA) if ordered to by the government. After all, Apple was reported to have been a partner in the NSA's PRISM surveillance program and has acknowledged it hands over user data when mandated by the government. But Apple has said users' fingerprint information will be encrypted and stored securely inside the phone's new A7 processor chip instead of on Apple's servers or backed up to iCloud, the company's Web-based storage service. Apple also has said it's not allowing third-party applications to access the scanner -- at least not yet. That's good news for users' privacy, experts say -- even amid news reports that the NSA can spy on smartphones. ""Your iPhone knows who you call. It knows where you are. And in the newest versions, it will know your thumbprint. Given revelations about how the NSA can access Apple devices, should you be worried about it having that biometric data? No. No no no no no no. Come on. No,"" writes Philip Bump in The Atlantic. ""Your fingerprint ... isn't traveling anywhere. Is it possible that the NSA could ask Apple to upload a user's fingerprint from the phone so that it can be transmitted to the agency? Sure. But that likely wouldn't be a request that comes through PRISM; it would probably require a separate warrant. Not impossible, but, given the burden of demonstrating need for a warrant, not as easy as a few keystrokes."" CNNMoney: iPhone fingerprint scanner will start security revolution . Fingerprint hacks . Then there's the question of hackers replicating fingerprints to break into phones. ""Fingerprints are not private, you leave them lying around everywhere, and if someone has enough incentive -- and the resources available to them -- they may try to defeat any security system that you trust your fingerprint to unlock,"" writes noted security researcher Graham Cluley on his blog. ""One thing is for sure. With the launch of the iPhone 5S, more people will be using fingerprint sensors as part of their daily security than ever before -- and the hackers will be certainly intrigued to see how they might circumvent it,"" Cluley adds. Dino Dai Zovi, co-author of ""The iOS Hacker's Handbook,"" told CNNMoney that if he were trying to hack an iPhone 5S, he would first try to lift prints from elsewhere on the device ""and figure out how to replay those to the sensor to log in to the person's phone."" This is not as hard as it might sound. A decade ago, a Japanese cryptographer demonstrated how to fool fingerprint-recognition systems by transferring latent prints to a ""finger"" made from gelatin, the ingredient found in Jell-O and other sweets. It was informally known as the ""Gummi bear hack."" But Apple's new Touch ID technology is presumably more sophisticated than those old systems. In addition, latent prints may not provide enough of an overlapping match to unlock a phone, says digital-security expert Robert Graham. ""You use a different part of your finger to touch the iPhone sensor than what you use to touch other things,"" writes Graham on the Errata Security blog. ""That means while hackers may be able to lift your thumbprint from you holding other objects, or from other parts of the phone itself, they probably can't get the tip print needed to do bad things on your iPhone. ""This means the fingerprint databases held by the NSA, FBI, and border security are largely useless at unlocking your phone: they don't cover the same parts of your fingers,"" Graham adds. But there is another potential vulnerability in the iPhone 5S's fingerprint scans. The Touch ID system also can be used as a secure way to approve purchases from iTunes or the App Store, which makes some security experts uncomfortable. ""If Apple is right that fingerprints never leave the device, that means the new iPhones will be sending some sort of authentication token to Apple servers to verify that the end user has produced a valid print,"" writes Dan Goodin in Ars Technica, a CNN.com content partner. ""If attackers figure out a way to capture and replay users' valid tokens, it could lead to new ways for criminals to hijack user accounts.""","The idea of handing over fingerprints to Apple via new iPhone 5S has some nervous .

"(CNN) -- An international music awards show announced a new Adele album Tuesday -- but nothing's happening, says her label chief. The confusion started with a tweet from the World Music Awards, an international contest that has been broadcast from such locales as Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Monaco. In a tweet, the show said, ""#adele confirms 2015 Tour After The Release Of Her New Album '25'!"" Not so fast, said Martin Mills, who heads Beggars Group. Adele's label, XL Recordings, is a subsidiary of Beggars Group. There's ""no truth in this,"" he told Billboard. So what's the deal with the World Music Awards?

Certainly, even a smidgen of Adele news is eagerly awaited by her fans -- and the music business, which would love to see any material equal the performance of the English singer's last record, ""21."" That album sold 3 million copies through digital streaming alone, which set a record. Altogether, it's sold more than 10 million copies and topped Billboard's year-end sales list in both 2011 and 2012 -- the first album ever to do that. Oh, and ""21"" won the Grammy for album of the year.

"(CNN) -- Veteran striker Miroslav Klose equaled the World Cup scoring record of Brazilian great Ronaldo to rescue a point for Germany in a pulsating 2-2 draw with Ghana in Fortaleza Saturday. The 36-year-old had only just come off the bench when he reacted quickly to a flicked header by Benedikt Howedes from a Toni Kroos corner to grab the equalizer in the Group G game. It was his 15th goal in the world's biggest sporting event, breaking the German record he had held with Gerd Muller. Klose also became only the third man to score in four World Cup finals tournaments, along with Pele and fellow German Uwe Seeler. He screwed a late chance wide, but a win for the Group G leaders would have been harsh on Ghana, who gave them an almighty scare. The Black Stars had the better of the first half and only two fine saves by Manuel Neuer denied Sulley Muntari and Christian Atsu. Germany started the second half brighter and Mario Gotze headed the opening goal -- which deflected in off his own knee -- in the 51st minute after a pin point cross from Thomas Muller. Ghana, so disappointing in its opening defeat to the USA, equalized almost immediately as Andre Ayew jumped to head home his second goal of the tournament. Just after the hour mark, Muntari picked out Asamoah Gyan, who raced through to beat Neuer with a fine finish. It was his fifth goal in World Cup finals, equaling the African record held by the great Roger Milla of Cameroon. Ghana substitute Jordan Ayew might have put the game beyond Germany's reach but he opted for goal rather than passing to the unmarked Gyan. It proved a vital moment and almost inevitably Germany drew level with Klose's close-range strike in the 70th minute to leave Joachim Low's team with four points after two games and set for qualification to the last 16. ""It doesn't matter whether I play from the start or come off the bench: all games are important and 15 goals in 20 World Cup games isn't bad,"" said Klose, who plays for Italian club Lazio. He took another of Muller's records for Germany's all-time leading scorer when he grabbed his 69th goal in a 6-1 thrashing of Armenia in a World Cup warmup game earlier this month. Muller scored 68 in just 62 games, his final goal for his country being the winner in the 1974 World Cup final against the Netherlands. Ghana, quarterfinalist in 2010, will go into its final group match knowing victory against Portugal will be needed to have a chance of progressing further. But midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng said it had been the right result after one of the best matches of a tournament full of incident-packed games. ""It went backwards and forwards, Germany could have won it, we could have won it -- the point was fair,"" said Boateng, who plays for German club Schalke and represented the country's under-21 team before choosing the nation of his father. Boateng's half-brother Jerome was in the Germany side, only the second time in World Cup history this has occurred.","Germany held 2-2 by Ghana in Group G .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton had to know she was going to have to talk about her wealth. The tightly orchestrated book tour for her new memoir has closely resembled a campaign -- with war rooms and surrogate coordination. So one would expect that Clinton was prepared to answer questions on any topic. But when the wealth question came, Clinton, the political heavy hitter, whiffed. Twice. The muffed answers have made trouble on their own for the potential presidential candidate by raising new questions about her ability to connect with average voters on economic issues. But they've also had another consequence. Prior to her book tour, she'd begun a pivot to the left. Many liberals had questioned her economic themes and coziness with Wall Street. In response, she stepped up her populist rhetoric. However, because of the blaring headlines on wealth, her outreach to party progressives has gone mostly unnoticed so far, possibly clouding her appeal to another important constituent. A day to forget . Clinton's first misstep came when she told ABC at the start of her book tour this month that she and her family ""came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debt,"" adding later that her family had ""no money"" at that time. She wasn't wrong when she said the first family left the White House way behind financially. She said they were burdened by legal bills and still had to keep a roof -- actually two -- over their heads and send their daughter to college. But here's a mighty big difference between Clinton and the average person. For starters, she and her husband were obviously well positioned to quickly capitalize on the post-presidential custom of cashing in. She left that part out. Hillary Clinton had a massive book advance in the works and, along with the former president, the prospect of making millions. This is what fueled cries of hypocrisy. After quickly trying to clean up the comments, though, Clinton swung and missed again on Sunday when questioned about her own financial standing and wealth inequality in an interview with The Guardian. Clinton compared herself to others and noted her situation is different, too. ""We pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off, not to name names; and we've done it through dint of hard work,"" she said. One reason Clinton's two missteps on wealth are surprising is that questions about the issue are not new and shouldn't have come as a surprise. Liberal websites like Mother Jones began asking questions about her speaking fees -- upwards of $200,000 -- in early May. Republican groups like the Republican National Committee and America Rising, an outside anti-Clinton super PAC, had been probing the topic longer. The progressive connection. Sally Kohn, a progressive activist and Clinton critic, said she handled the wealth question poorly and ""certainly has enough money to hire a better speaking coach."" But she downplayed the mistake. ""Why people do have a problem with her is not because of her personal wealth, it is because of her coziness with Wall Street. That is the problem,"" Kohn said. The monied elite is an anathema to liberals, who decry wealth inequality, the corrosive impact of too-big-to-fail businesses and, of course, the overwhelming power in America of the professional investor class vs. average people struggling to save. For much of Clinton's time on the paid speaking circuit, the former secretary of state has focused on bipartisan issues and kept some distance with hot political issues. But less than a month before questions about her wealth and understanding of the middle class started to define her book tour, Clinton departed from more bipartisan topics and stepped up her populist rhetoric in a May speech at the New America Foundation. She bashed George W. Bush, embraced material from the liberal playbook, and highlighted populist themes in her speeches. Clinton charged up her rhetoric, too. She blasted tight-fisted millionaires, decried the current economy as a ""throwback to the Gilded Age,"" and dusted off old standbys about Republican trickle-down economics. The change in tone hasn't happened in a vacuum, and may have projected that Clinton and her aides expected criticism about her wealth, stature and ability to relate to everyday Americans. But because of the mistakes, her populist pivot has largely gone unnoticed. An exclusive club . Instead, it's Clinton's two tone-deaf statements about her family's wealth that have defined her book tour, so far. They have also begun to shine a light on Clinton's work as a constant fundraiser. Between her campaign for president in 2008 and her time as the head of a global foundation, she spent a considerable amount of time courting the money of millionaires and billionaires. Her foundation -- The Clinton Foundation -- has also become a bastion for corporate donors. Stephen L. Bing, the founder of Shangri-La business group; Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex and Cheryl and Haim Saban, Democratic megadonors and the owners of Univision, have donated between $10 million and $25 million. Republicans have seized on it and are looking to portray Clinton as out-of-touch and someone who has spent too much time in the ""bubble"" and in other rarefied surroundings. They point to her gaffes as well as a comment from earlier in the year when she told a group of auto dealers that she hadn't driven a car since 1996. And while pro-Clinton Democrats have defended her, others in the party have begun to knock her -- some more subtly than others. They also say she's out of touch. Vice President Joe Biden, who may be running for president, appears to be getting in on the action. Biden said on Monday that he ""makes a lot of money"" as vice president. But he made sure to mention he was ""listed as the poorest man in Congress"" and said he has ""no savings account."" Key point: Biden stressed that he's been ""really, really fortunate"" compared to the way others have struggled. Bush is still Clinton's bogeyman . 6 times Clinton sounded, acted like a candidate .","Hillary Clinton has now misstepped twice on questions about her wealth .
The wealth questions come at the same time that Clinton has stepped up her populist rhetoric .
Democrats to the left question Clinton's economic ideas and coziness with Wall Street .

"Gaza (CNN) -- An Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza overnight killed three high-ranking members of Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, the militant group said Thursday. Seven civilians were also killed. The three members of the Brigades' 15-member military council were killed in a bombing in Rafah in southern Gaza, according to Hamas. The announcement of their deaths comes the day after Hamas said an Israeli strike had killed the wife and at least two children of Mohammed Deif, the head of the military wing. Deif's 7-month-old son was killed, and the body of one of his daughters was removed from the rubble later, according to Hamas. Another of Deif's daughters is missing and believed to be buried in the rubble. The strike failed to kill Deif, Hamas said. Role in capture of Israeli soldier . The militant group, which controls Gaza, said the leaders killed overnight were Mohammed Abu Shamala, Raed al-Attar and Mohammed Barhoum. A crater the size of a residential block was left at the site of the airstrike. According to Palestinian officials, Israeli airstrikes have killed 27 since midnight local time (5 p.m. ET Wednesday). Hamas vowed revenge for their deaths. ""The assassination of the Qassam leaders is a great Israeli crime that will not succeed in breaking the will of our people or even weaken the resistance, and Israel will pay the price,"" spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said. Al-Attar, the commander of the Qassam Brigades in Rafah, is believed to be the most senior of the three. The Israeli military said it had confirmed that it killed the three men. It described al-Attar and Abu Shamala as ""high-ranking Hamas commanders responsible for major terror attacks against Israelis."" Al-Attar played a ""major role"" in the capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006, the Israel Defense Forces said on its Twitter account. Shalit was held captive until a deal was struck for his release in 2011 in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. ""This morning's strike sends a clear message to those responsible for planning attacks,"" IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said in a statement. ""We will strike those that have terrorized our communities, towns and cities, we will pursue the perpetrators of abduction of our soldiers and teenagers, and we will succeed in restoring security to the State of Israel."" Renewed fighting . The return to violence between Israel and Hamas began Tuesday after a cease-fire and peace talks in Cairo fell apart, with each side blaming the other for the breakdown. The Egyptian-brokered negotiations were aimed at finding a lasting end to the current Gaza conflict, which has killed more than 2,000 Palestinians, around 70% of them civilians, according to the United Nations. The fighting, which erupted in early July, has killed 67 people on the Israeli side, most of them soldiers. But the two sides failed to reach a compromise, with Israel calling for Gaza to be demilitarized and Hamas requesting, among other things, the lifting of Israel's economic blockade on Gaza. Humanitarian groups have warned of a dire situation in Gaza, where tens of thousands of people have been left homeless amid the destruction caused by the conflict. The Israeli military said Thursday that more than 225 rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza since the truce collapsed this week. Over the same period, Israeli forces have attacked around 150 targets in Gaza, the IDF said. One airstrike Thursday hit a cemetery in Gaza City, where a group of people were digging a grave for relatives, Palestinian health officials said. The attack killed six people and injured others, paramedics told the Hamas-run Al Aqsa TV. Hamas threatens airport . ""Our policy is simple: If you shoot, you will get attacked,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday. ""If you try more, you will get double."" Israel will not stop its efforts against Hamas ""until we can ensure full safety and security"" for people in Israel's south, the prime minister said. The Qassam Brigades on Wednesday warned international airlines to refrain from landing at or taking off from Ben Gurion Airport in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv from Thursday morning onward. U.S. aviation authorities briefly banned U.S. carriers from flying to and from the airport in late July after a Hamas rocket struck nearby. Many international airlines followed suit, canceling flights to and from Tel Aviv. But flights picked up again after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration lifted the ban. Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, had lobbied Washington to reverse the extraordinary order. Talal Abu Rahma reported from Gaza, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.","NEW: An Israeli airstrike hits people digging a grave in a cemetery, health officials say .

"(CNN) -- For a man dubbed ""The Big Easy,"" Ernie Els isn't putting his feet up anytime soon. One of the most successful golfers in the world, the 42-year-old boasts an incredible three major championship crowns and nearly 70 wins in a stellar career spanning 22 years. But far from basking in his golfing glory, the South African is throwing his weight -- and his millions -- behind an important cause close to his heart. The former world No. 1's son Ben was diagnosed with autism five years ago, and Els plans to open a world-leading research and education center -- ""something the world's never seen before."" ""We have one child in our family with autism. I've seen families with three kids with autism and I want to tell you it must be one of the hardest things in the world because just to do your normal, everyday life stuff must be almost impossible,"" he told CNN. ""He's nine years old and he's not speaking yet. He goes to a very good school in Florida. That's another thing that's lacking around the world, is education for autistic children. That's why we moved from England to go to Florida for proper treatment for him."" Until recently, Els had remained private about his family life. Now he's using his status -- winning the U.S. Open in 1994 and 1997 and the British Open in 2002 -- to help fund the Els for Autism Foundation in Florida. Since 2009, he has been hosting golf tournaments to raise money for his dream center. It will be based in the U.S. but it is hoped its programs and research will help autistic children around the world. Els has so far raised around $25 million towards the project, but is still $5 million short of his target for construction. And the man who topped the European Tour's money list in 1993 and 1994, and is nicknamed for his six-foot-three-inch frame and seemingly effortless golf swing, hasn't limited his enterprises to autism research. Giving it back: Els' off-course passions . Els' golf foundation, now in its 13th year, was established to help under-privileged kids take up a sport unaffordable to most in his native South Africa. He also contributes to the economy of the Cape region where he grew up, investing in a wine and restaurant business plus an award-winning golf resort that he helped design. So while Els has spent most of his life carving a name for himself as one of the best golfers in the world, he says he now wants to be remembered for dedicating the rest of it to autism research.","Former world No. 1 Ernie Els is throwing his support behind ambitious autism center .

"(CNN) -- The brand name Yukos no longer exists and its former founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky has left Russia after being freed from jail, but a landmark ruling in the Hague released Monday ensures their legacy will live on during a sensitive period of time for Vladimir Putin. Yukos was one of Russia's oil giants through the 1990s and until the early 2000s, when its assets were expropriated by the state after a political battle with Khodorkovsky. Now the Permanent Court of Arbitration, in what is considered a landmark judgment, has ordered payment of damages to its former shareholders, totaling $50 billion and including interest and fees for violation of a treaty covering Russia's energy assets. This case goes back to 2005 and strikes at the heart of Putin's tactics to strip Yukos and Khordorkovsky under charges of tax evasion. The three judge panel called the Federation's move ""equivalent of expropriation of claimants' investments."" Those claimants, representing Group Menatep Ltd. or GML, include former Yukos CEO Platon Lebedev and four others who were seeking damages of up to $114 billion. The main asset of Yukos, known as Yuganskneftegaz, was auctioned in late 2004 for just $9.3 billion and purchased by state-run Rosneft, which is now run by Putin confidant Igor Sechin. The Russian president has big plans for Rosneft to be one of the top energy players in the world. It now has an enterprise value of $115 billion, but that is just a start with agreements signed with Exxon-Mobil, ENI of Italy and its largest shareholder BP, which has a 20% stake in the group. Rosneft holds the position that it did not participate in the arbitrations and therefore is not bound by the rulings. In a statement it said, ""Rosneft believes that all of its purchases of former Yukos assets, and all other actions taken by it with respect to Yukos were entirely lawful and proper applicable law."" The response from Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during a press conference Monday was equally unforgiving about the actions taken. ""The process is not over; appellations are allowed,"" Lavrov said. ""The Russian side, as well as agencies representing Russia in this trial will use all available legal possibilities to defend their stance."" This ruling comes as Moscow faces intense scrutiny for its support of the ongoing fight by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Another round of European Union economic sanctions are pending after Washington proceeded to tighten the noose earlier this month. Khodorkovsky was not part of this case, but an attorney who represented the former oligarch during his trial on charges by the Russian state said the ruling serves as a partial vindication for his former client. According to Robert Amsterdam, ""this is a very important decision to be read by all those who lose assets to autocrats."" The arbitrators, he said, had ""very heroically"" cut through ""mistruths"" to find in favor of the claimants. This ruling could not only influence Western-led sanctions on Moscow, but could potentially strain talks to find common ground between Russia, Ukraine and the European Union over future gas supplies into Europe.

"(CNN) -- Students in Gainesville, Georgia, are likely eating a better lunch than you today. On the menu in their cafeterias? Chicken salad on a bed of spinach with strawberries and Mandarin oranges. Boneless wings. Brunch for lunch. Roughly 76% of students in Gainesville City Schools qualify for free or reduced-cost meals under the National School Lunch Program. Since the program's nutritional guidelines went into place in 2012, school administrators have been getting creative with their food program to create meals children like. ""Taste testing is where it's at,"" said Penny Fowler, the district's director of school nutrition. ""They're your customers. It's like running a business."" Fowler said her team has worked hard to implement the new guidelines, which are entering a third school year this fall. The ultimate goal is to reduce childhood obesity, which according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in 30 years. Gone are the days of mystery meats and grilled cheese on white bread. Instead, participating schools in the federal lunch program are required to serve skim or low-fat milk, add more whole grains, include a fruit and vegetable at each meal and prepare food with zero grams of trans fat per serving. Calorie and sodium limitations are also in place. ""With one-third of American children obese or overweight, members in both parties agreed that Americans' tax dollars should fund healthy and wholesome food,"" said Kevin Concannon, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services. USDA new rules for school meals . About 90% of schools are now in compliance with the new guidelines, according to the USDA, with students eating about 16% more vegetables and 23% more fruit on a daily basis. But there's been controversy over the program's implications for school food budgets. The USDA says 1 million fewer students nationwide are eating federal school lunches since the guidelines were enacted in 2012 -- either by personal choice, or because their schools have opted out of the lunch program altogether. What it really comes down to, experts say, is money. Wealthier school districts can turn down federal reimbursements if their students aren't enjoying the healthier fare. Districts with more students who qualify for the program, such as in Gainesville, often don't have a choice. Economics of school lunch . Established in 1946, the National School Lunch Program was created to provide free or low-cost meals to students. Although the program is optional in most states, the federal reimbursement for students' meals is so significant that some schools find it too expensive to run programs on their own, said Diane Pratt-Heavner, â€Ždirector of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, a national organization of school nutrition professionals. The School Nutrition Association was instrumental in helping the Obama administration put these new nutrition guidelines in place; now the organization is lobbying for schools to be allowed to opt out. Opponents say food companies are working behind the scenes, trying to keep their less-healthy items on the menu longer. The USDA gives schools in the continental U.S. $0.28 per lunch for students who pay full price. For students in need, the USDA pays almost 10 times more: $2.58 for those who qualify for reduced price meals and $2.98 for children who qualify for a free lunch. It isn't surprising then that state agencies reported to the USDA that students leaving the program were mainly from residential child care institutions, wealthier districts and/or smaller schools with low percentages of children eligible for free and reduced-price meals. Fort Thomas Independent Schools in Kentucky is one such district that decided to opt out for the 2014-2015 academic year. The local high school was losing students to its rivals: Subway and a handful of convenience stores down the street. With an open campus, students can leave for lunch, and administrators say the daily exodus increased after new nutritional guidelines went into effect two years ago. This meant less money being spent in the cafeteria. ""The guidelines are too strict and the kids can leave,"" said Gina Sawma, the school district's food and nutrition director. ""If they aren't eating with us, they're leaving and eating junk."" Sawma says the biggest challenges were the calorie and sodium restrictions required by the federal program. The students wanted more protein and larger portions, especially athletes. The school has a robust football program that has won 22 Kentucky state championships. Douglas County High School in Colorado and Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake Board of Education in upstate New York also have called it quits, citing burdensome regulations, hungry children and a decline in food sales that led to large amounts of debt. Like Fort Thomas, these school districts are in areas with relatively high median incomes and have a low percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced meals. Donna Brazile: Let them eat ... whatever . Schools that predominantly serve low-income students have fared better in both revenue gains and participation, according to the USDA. Since they are unable to opt out of the program, and students can't afford to eat elsewhere, cafeteria workers are making the new rules work. The Los Angeles Unified School District, which has one the highest concentrations of low-income students in California, is an example. Since the nutrition guidelines were established, there has been a 14% increase of participation in its school lunch program. Testing taste buds . For some schools, labor and food costs, and the quality of kitchen equipment can play a role in whether their revamped food program is a success, says Pratt-Heavner. Schools in small and rural areas may also have local vendors and distributors that don't carry a great deal of healthy food options. Sawma in Kentucky, for example, found that foods that met the new dietary guidelines from her vendors didn't taste all that great. She says companies are trying, but may just need more time to reformulate their foods so they taste better. ""It's important to keep in mind that all school meal programs are different,"" Pratt-Heavner explained. ""Some communities have an easier time if students are more familiar with healthy foods at home."" Most students seem to be liking the healthier lunches despite some early negative feedback. A survey published in the Childhood Obesity journal reported that 70% of elementary school children, 70% of middle schoolers and 63% of high school students liked their school's meals. And schools opting out of the federal lunch program aren't necessarily serving unhealthy fare. In the Fort Thomas district, Sawma said schools will continue to serve extra fruits and vegetables at no charge and add back larger portions of protein and the popular homemade soups, which had to be discontinued due to the National School Lunch Program's calorie restrictions. She said she has received calls from vendors selling unhealthy foods after the school district announced it was leaving the federal program, but she made it clear her schools have always offered healthy foods. Soft drinks and candy bars aren't on the menu. For those schools remaining in the National School Lunch Program, the USDA is offering technical support, help with recipes and financial assistance. According to the USDA, about $48 million in grants is still available to schools with lunch programs. ""The USDA continues to help schools by demonstrating flexibility and common sense as we work together to improve the health of the nation's next generation,"" Concannon said. ""The department will continue to provide additional funding and training to schools as progress continues.""","USDA: Students eating more fruits and vegetables with lunch guidelines enacted in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Eminem was a bit of a novelty when he burst on the music scene in 1999 with his major-label debut album, ""The Slim Shady LP."" One of the highest-profile white rappers not only to have major crossover success but also street cred, the artist born Marshall Mathers no longer has to deal as much with the issue of race in a music genre dominated by African-American men. Instead, he is grappling with issues regarding another minority group. ""I poke fun at other people, myself,"" Eminem recently told Rolling Stone magazine about using a slur against gay people in his rhymes. ""But the real me sitting here right now talking to you has no issues with gay, straight, transgender, at all."" The rapper has always courted controversy, and it's not the first time he's attracted attention for gay epithets in his music. Eminem now is feeling the heat for the not at all gay friendly lyrics in ""Rap God"" from his eighth solo album, ""The Marshall Mathers LP 2,"" which came out Tuesday. A sequel to his hit 2000 album, ""The Marshall Mathers LP,"" the latest project is garnering some critical acclaim. Consequence of Sound writer Mike Madden notes in a Time piece that ""Eminem doesn't have that center-of-the-universe pull these days, nor could he or anyone else have expected 'MMLP2' to yield the results of its alpha."" ""But, this one's nostalgic in all the right ways, a worthy look back at the LP that made him the world's most popular cult figure,"" he writes. ""And, since we still haven't found an inheritor to his madness, this version of Marshall Mathers is more than welcome."" In reviewing the album, USA Today's Edna Gundersen gave it 3Â½ stars out of 4, saying, ""On 'The Marshall Mathers LP 2,' he recaptures the original release's wild, clever, emotional brilliance in a flurry of caustic, brazenly honest, rapid-fire rhymes and aggressive beats. So what's the problem? Once the bravest visionary in rap's underworld, Eminem spends much of 'MMLP2' gazing into the past, reworking early tricks and wading in nostalgia rather than forging a fresh path."" Eminem returns to hip-hop at an interesting time. Two of its biggest stars, Kanye West and Jay Z, are known as much for their high-profile relationships (to Kim Kardashian and Beyonce, respectively) and roles as fathers as they are for their music. And the new rising stars include the likes of Kendrick Lamar, who is making a name for himself basically by dissing everyone. It's an era where music artists strive to be shocking (Miley Cyrus, anyone?) while still in fear of running afoul of the political correctness police. Sober after an addiction to prescription drugs he told CNN almost killed him and the father of a teen daughter, Eminem, now 41, has also grown. The new album is a follow-up to a different time in his life, but it remains as personal as his past projects. ""I always say this about my music, and music in general: Music is like a time capsule,"" he told Complex magazine. ""Each album reflects what I'm going through or what's going on in my life at that moment."" He told the magazine he is unsure of where he fits into today's musical landscape. ""I struggle with that sometimes,"" Eminem said. ""I guess it's more about where people see me, and where people feel like I fit in. Hopefully when all is said and done, people see me as just an MC."" These days there are a plethora of white rappers that can thank Eminem for further opening the door to the genre. Artists such as Mac Miller, Yelawolf and Macklemore are now hip-hop mainstays. When Brand Nubian rapper Lord Jamar recently criticized the latter during an interview (""Okay, white rappers, you're coming to this almost as a guest.

"New York (CNN) -- Can buskers from around the world inspire an international peace movement? That's the idea behind ""Playing for Change,"" a multimedia movement designed to break down global barriers and connect people of every race through the power of music. More than 150 -- mostly street -- musicians from 25 countries have joined their voices to spread their message of peace and create a truly global phenomenon with millions of followers across the world. It all started in 2004, when Grammy award-winning producer Mark Johnson set off on a musical journey to capture street musicians around the world and combine their voices together. Bringing his mobile studio and cameras with him, Johnson's mission led him and his small crew to an escapade across the globe -- they tracked the street musicians, put headphones on them and started recording each of their parts, before blending it all together to create unique versions of classic songs, such as ""Stand By Me."" The powerful and versatile performances were mixed and posted online, quickly becoming a worldwide sensation. The band's version of the Ben E. King classic -- which interwove the performances of 18 street musicians, including a South African choir -- has become an internet hit with more than 40 million views on YouTube alone.

The band's bestselling CD/DVD set ""Playing for Change: Songs Around The World"" was also a big hit, debuting at number 10 on Billboard's Pop Chart in April 2009. The recordings gave rise to the Playing for Change Foundation, an initiative aiming to inspire, educate and empower youth in Africa and other developing regions by building music schools in communities from Ghana and South Africa to Mali and Tibet. ""We are building schools to give those kids who are deprived...to give them a chance to express themselves tomorrow -- at least they can learn music, they can be confident, they can learn how to dance, they can be somebody,"" says honey-voiced Mermans Kenkosenki from the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the main singers of Playing for Change. Kenkosenki, along with his compatriot Jason Tamba and Titi Tsira from South Africa, are some of the African voices representing the continent in the movement. They share the stage with musicians from the Netherlands to the United States as part of an international touring band that brings artists of all backgrounds together, raising money and awareness for the foundation. ""There are people who play music for the fame, for money, and there are people who play for the love of it,"" says Kenkosenki, who is also the frontman and founder of the band Afro Fiesta. See also: Kanya King: MOBO founder's top 5 pop picks . The foundation's first school was opened in the spring of 2009 in Gugulethu, a township a few miles outside of Cape Town, South Africa. ""You got so many lost young kids that their parents don't work, they are unemployed and the kids get to hang around in the streets, they don't get to go to the school because there is no money to send them,"" says Tsiri who is from Gugulethu. ""This school being built in that township is giving that child a chance, a chance to get a free education, get a skill of music and become a professional musician and be the breadwinner of their family,"" she adds. So far, the foundation has been running eight programs, working with over 600 children and creating more than 150 jobs. ""It is a great feeling to give a child a skill,"" says Tsiri. ""It is the best movement ever -- it is really making a huge change and I am very happy being a part of it."" The Playing for Change roster also includes world-renowned artists such as Manu Chao, Tinariwen, Vusi Mahlasela and Bono. Songs they've covered include classics such as ""I'd Rather Go Blind,"" ""Gimme Shelter,"" ""(Sitting On) The Dock Of The Bay and many more."" ""When you look at us you see in each of us a different character,"" says Tamba, a skilful guitar player. ""Everyone is doing their thing, it's not following somebody but is bringing what he has deep in there [heart] and together that brings the fire."" Read also: Meet Asa, African pop legend in the making . Last year, Playing for Change also joined forces with the United Nations to present ""United,"" an original song penned to raise awareness about the opportunities and challenges arising from life in a planet populated by seven billion people. In the acoustic guitar-driven anthem, Kenkosenki sings lines like ""I want to see the world united"" before crooning in Lingala, a Bantu language spoken in parts of the DRC. He is then joined by a host of singers across the world, who deliver their parts in Arabic, Hebrew and other languages. ""The whole world played the music,"" says Kenkosenki. ""We need to be together to listen to each other -- that's how it should be, bringing people from different cultures to work together, that to me is powerful.""

"(CNN) -- The lead singer of a 1970 tune that is sampled on a new Kanye West song has filed suit, alleging the rapper used the snippet without his permission. Ricky Spicer was 12 when he became the lead singer for a group called the Ponderosa Twins Plus One in 1969. A year later, they recorded ""Bound,"" according to the suit. Spicer, now 56, says his voice is heard in West's song ""Bound 2"" at least four times. ""Mr. Spicer's voice is sampled exactly as he recorded it and his voice, altered by the Defendants, is also heard several times,"" the 13-page complaint alleges. In the credits for the album ""Yeezus,"" Def Jam Records says the song was licensed through Rhino Entertainment and Robinson Music Group. The lawsuit names West, Def Jam, Rhino, Roc-A-Fella Records, and Universal Music Group as defendants. It seeks unspecified damages for common law copyright infringement. The Ponderosa Twins were two sets of twins and Spicer. According to the lawsuit, Alvin and Alfred Pelham are dead and Keith and Kirk Gardner are imprisoned. Spicer has power of attorney for the Gardner twins, the suit says. The suit, which was filed in New York, says Spicer has a copyright on ""Bound.""

"(CNN) -- Kurdish forces backed by U.S. air cover made gains Friday against ISIS fighters in Iraq's Mosul province as NATO leaders concluded a summit in Wales, pledging to help defeat the radical Islamic forces. The Kurdish fighters, known as the Peshmerga, retook several villages seized this summer in ISIS' lightning assault in Iraq as well as high ground overlooking plains on the approach to Mosul, CNN's Anna Coren reported. ""It is a duty of everybody who loves democracy and freedom and human rights to struggle against the terrorists,"" said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Rowsch Shaways, a Kurd. U.S. forces conducted four airstrikes Friday around Mosul Dam and in Irbil, destroying an observation post, several vehicles and three mortar positions, U.S. Central Command said. Who is the ISIS? In Kirkuk province, ISIS fighters kidnapped nearly 50 men from the village of Tal Ali after beating them, according to Kurdish security forces. ISIS ordered residents to fight the Peshmerga before leaving, the Kurdish officials said. In Wales, President Barack Obama said NATO allies were committed to fighting ISIS. ""It's not going to happen overnight, but we're steadily moving in the right direction,"" Obama said. What can U.S. do against ISIS and could it work? NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said alliance members ""stand ready to assist Iraq"" in its fight against ISIS, but neither he nor British Prime Minister David Cameron suggested there are immediate plans to send combat troops. ""For Britain's part we don't rule anything out. We'll act on our national interest,"" Cameron said in response to a reporter's question about committing troops. ""I think in terms of the sort of decisions you're talking about, we're not at that stage yet, and I think it's very important that what we do is part of a comprehensive plan."" In addition to conducting some 131 airstrikes against ISIS targets in the last several weeks, the United States has sent military advisers to Iraq to help with strategies to combat ISIS. Canada -- a NATO member -- said Friday it also will send ""several dozen"" troops to Iraq to help advise that country's government on fighting ISIS, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's office said.

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis' trip to South Korea memorialized the atrocities of the last century. On the way home, the Pope became embroiled in controversy about a conflict raging in the current one. During a lengthy discussion, Francis remarked on the spread of cruelty and torture before being asked about violence against religious minorities in Iraq, and whether he approved of the U.S. bombing campaign aimed at stopping the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. With what seemed careful deliberation, Pope Francis said: ""In these cases where there is an unjust aggression, I can only say this: It is licit to stop the unjust aggressor. I underline the verb: stop. I do not say bomb, make war, I say stop by some means. With what means can they be stopped? These have to be evaluated. To stop the unjust aggressor is licit."" This response -- and the reaction to it -- says much about the complexity of running an organization that is at once modern and ancient, religious and political, international and parochial. But what exactly did he mean? Was he, as a few excitable writers suggested, calling for a new crusade? Certainly, much of the media response quickly fixated on what seemed to be approval for a military campaign and how a Pope -- the leader of the Catholic Church -- was seemingly sanctioning war against an Islamic caliphate. Actually, he wasn't. Crusading, as defined by most historians, generally involved taking religious vows to head east and assist in military expeditions against Islamic powers in exchange for spiritual rewards (redemption from sin). Historians have identified major campaigns as the First, Second, Third, etc. Crusades. In response to these conquests, the local Islamic powers leveraged the idea of jihad to rally disparate Muslim groups together. Yet although the Crusades featured not just plenty of violence but also peaceful cross-cultural exchange, they aren't an example Francis wants to invoke. In fact, he isn't saying that anyone should take vows and go off to fight. Instead, Francis is making the point that taking action to stop evil is just. This idea of justified violence, even from Catholics, chiefly emerged from the writing of St. Augustine (354-430). As Matthew Gabriele, associate professor of medieval studies at Virginia Tech, writes: ""Augustine argued that war was never desirable but was sometimes necessary. We must protect those who suffer from unjust aggression. If that could be accomplished without war, so much the better, but force could be used by legitimate authorities as a last resort. The end goal, however, was always -- and simply -- lasting peace."" That's the context for understanding the ancient part of Francis' response. The modern context emerged in how he concluded his answer. ""One nation alone cannot judge how to stop an unjust aggressor,"" Francis said. ""After the Second World War there was the idea of the United Nations. It is there that this should be discussed. Is there an unjust aggressor? It would seem there is. How do we stop him? Only that, nothing more."" Such pursuit of multiple perspectives to ward off bias is also Augustinian. In ""On Christian Doctrine,"" St. Augustine argued that reading the Bible required special training because though the book contains all the truths of the universe, humans (flawed creatures that we are) are far too likely to assume that whatever we think is good is also what God thinks is good. To counteract this, St. Augustine prescribed a strict intellectual diet of the best liberal arts and science education the late Roman world could provide. Multiple perspectives help us discern what is truly just from what might just be convenient. In a way, that's what Francis is doing with his words, too. He's concerned that any individual leader or nation is far too likely to assume that someone with whom they disagree is unjust, and thus the principles of stopping unjust action instead becomes a tool for warmongering. Instead, he argues, we should try to find consensus before acting, collectively, to put an end to atrocity. ""We must also have memory,"" Francis said. ""How many times under this excuse of stopping an unjust aggressor the powers (that intervened) have taken control of peoples, and have made a true war of conquest."" History teaches us all about the dangers of mission creep. And it also makes clear that when two sides engage in the rhetoric of religious war, things can deteriorate rapidly. Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, for example, both routinely railed against the West as ""crusaders,"" an accusation that gained traction in the Islamic world after President George W. Bush called for ""this crusade, this war on terrorism"" after 9/11. Francis doesn't want to make a similar mistake. Indeed, while he named himself after a medieval saint who lived during the era of the Crusades, that St. Francis didn't actually go to war. Instead he went on mission, seeking (at least as we remember it today) dialogue and understanding. And that's certainly been Pope Francis' path so far. But when there is great suffering in the world, as is being inflicted on religious and ethnic minorities in areas controlled by ISIS, then Francis says one must act, while also drawing on both the ancient idea of justified war and the modern concept of international cooperation. The question, of course, is whether in a digital age -- when misinformation and misunderstanding spreads so fast -- Pope Francis can somehow find true harmony between old and new. His ability to do so will determine the lessons his papacy ultimately hands down for posterity.","Asked about bombing in Iraq, Pope Francis says it is ""licit to stop the unjust aggressor""
David Perry says those remarks aren't a call for a new crusade, as some have suggested .
He adds that the Pope is trying to balance lessons of the ancient and modern ."
"(CNN) -- I was introduced to pop -- soda for you Southerners -- at a young age. My parents used it as a treat, like birthday cake. As I got older, I remember having pop around the house all the time. As a kid, my drink of choice was Mountain Dew. I loved the taste of an ice cold Dew on a hot summer day. A lot of my favorite memories are associated with its sweet taste. As I matured, my taste changed to Diet Pepsi and, more recently, Diet Coke. I enjoyed starting my day with a Diet Coke before the first period class arrived. It was part of my relaxation routine -- a comfort drink, so to speak. The taste, the sound, the ""fizz."" I would tell people, ""I need my caffeine."" 10 reasons to give up diet soda . I was aware of all the health problems that have been linked to drinking pop. It never stopped me. The empty calories, the dangers of sugar and artificial sweeteners couldn't sway me. I had to have it. After my first dose in the morning, I crashed a few hours later. I experienced huge energy swings throughout the day. I had acid reflux disease. But those couldn't be because of what I drank, could it? This habit had a trickle-down effect to my children. I had it in the house at all times. My girlfriend kept it in her house as well. But it wasn't a habit I wanted my two teenage girls starting up. I wanted to be a better role model. My words don't hold much value if I am drinking what I tell them that they cannot, I thought. Then, on December 30, that all changed. After I was selected to be part of the CNN Fit Nation team, I decided to take a look at all aspects of my life. What can I do to make myself healthier? I asked myself. How the 'Sassy Six' came to be . That day, I decided to do the unthinkable: I quit drinking pop. Don't assume this has been easy for me. I struggle with the thought of it. I miss it and can still taste it six weeks later. Giving up pop has been one of the most difficult things I have done, and yet it's also one of the healthiest. Although I miss every aspect of drinking a Diet Coke every day, I know my body feels better. I feel less dependent on this comfort food. If I'm having a bad day, I don't have to run upstairs and grab a Diet Coke. I definitely have more energy, and my body doesn't ache. I have not had an issue with acid reflux since I quit. Is that a coincidence? I think not. Now I have to retrain my brain. Water has become my drink of choice. I know ... water is boring. But I have come to appreciate how good an ice cold glass of water actually tastes. The desire to change myself into a healthier version became more important than the desire to drink pop. It took me a while to realize that I needed to make that change. I wish I had listened to my body sooner! I challenge you to do the same. Will you give up pop with me? Or make another small change in order to be healthier? Tell me your plan in the comments below, and share your success with me on Twitter @TriHardMike.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese police have arrested nearly 1,000 suspected members of a banned religious group, state media reported. The arrests come months after five members of the group, known as the Church of Almighty God or ""Quannengshen"", were charged with the brutal killing in May of a woman in a McDonald's restaurant while they were allegedly trying to recruit her. A report by state news agency Xinhua said that the group, which Beijing regards as a dangerous doomsday cult, cheated people, illegally collected money and ""violated the law under the guise of religion."" ""A series of acts by its members have harmed people's lives and property, and disrupted social stability,"" Xinhua said. The report added that members of the cult, also known as ""Eastern Lightning,"" were responsible for ""numerous"" suicides and murders, including those of their own family. Among those arrested were nearly 100 ""backbone members"", Xinhua said. IN DEPTH: 'Eastern Lightning': The banned religious group that has China worried . In May, a 37-year-old woman was beaten to death in the fast food outlet in the eastern province of Shandong. The case triggered a wave of revulsion toward the group on Chinese social media. ""She was a demon,"" one of the suspects, Zhang Lidong, said in television interview following his arrest. ""She was an evil spirit."" Five adults have been charged with murder, and their trial begins on Thursday, Xinhua said. The group has been on a list of 14 banned religious groups issued by China's Ministry of Public Security since 1995. According to Chinese media reports, it has been responsible for a spate of robberies, assaults and kidnappings. In 2012, hundreds of members were rounded up after the group publicly proclaimed the end of the world was imminent. In a statement provided to CNN in June, members of the group responsible for its English-language website said it was ""very natural"" for the Chinese Communist Party to blame the group for the McDonald's death because the Party slandered and then suppressed those that disagreed with it. ""They always find some excuse in advance and fabricate things and slander them,"" said the statement. Founded in the 1990s in central China, the group believes that Jesus has been reincarnated as Yang Xiangbin, the wife of the group's founder, Zhao Weishan. The couple fled to the United States in 2000, Xinhua reported.","Almost 1,000 members of a banned religious group arrested in China .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Offensive remarks about China made by Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer have struck a chord on Chinese social media -- with some users actually seeing them in a positive light. The outspoken leader of the Palmer United Party went on a tirade on Monday night during a televised interview on Australian television channel ABC. When asked about his legal battle with Chinese firm CITIC Pacific Ltd, Palmer defended his position before launching into a verbal attack on China, calling the Chinese people ""bastards"" and ""mongrels"" who ""shoot their own people."" ""I'm saying that because they're Communist, because they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country [Australia],"" said Palmer. On Tuesday, Palmer clarified that his statements were meant for the Chinese state-owned company that he is locked in a dispute with, and not for the Chinese community or the Chinese government. 'Vicious attack' Palmer's words sparked outrage among Chinese and Australian citizens and officials -- though they did find support on Weibo, the Chinese micro-blogging platform. ""Please separate the Chinese people from the Chinese government. Smart people will know what he is really talking about,"" wrote one Weibo user. ""If those who kill their own citizens aren't bastards, then what are they?"" ""He [Palmer] was clearly referring to 'Communist,' not to China as a whole, and not about Chinese people. Global Times please do not take things out of context,"" wrote another microblogger, referring to an opinion piece published in the state-controlled English-language news outlet, Global Times. The article described Palmer's rant as a ""vicious attack by one of the Australian elite"" and said that he had called ""a whole country 'bastard.'"" It also called for sanctions to be imposed on Palmer's companies. Meanwhile, official voices continued to condemn the Australian businessman. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called Palmer's outburst ""over the top, shrill and wrong"" during an interview with an Australian radio station. He said the Chinese economic boom helped Australia get through the global financial crisis. ""Palmer's words about China in recent days are totally irrational and absurd,"" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement released on Wednesday.","Australian tycoon Clive Palmer delivers scathing tirade against China .

"(CNN) -- Jack Whittaker had the noblest of plans. Upon winning the then-largest-ever $314 million Powerball jackpot in 2002, the West Virginia construction company owner said he wanted to pay tithes to the Church of God, get some of his laid-off workers back on the job and start a charitable foundation. He might buy a helicopter, and he'd definitely pamper his daughter and granddaughter, he said. ""I'm not going to buy anything for myself,"" he said during a news conference announcing his windfall. ""The very first thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to go home. I'm going to sit down and make out three checks to three pastors for 10% of this check. That's the very first thing I'm going to do."" Already a millionaire via his company, Whittaker predicted the money wouldn't faze him at all. His life, he said, would carry on normally. ""If I can help it, it's not going to change. I'm content with my life,"" he told reporters. ""I'm not going to change my life much."" Yet by 2007, barely four years after what should have been the luckiest day of his life, Whittaker was a broken-down man who had lost his granddaughter to drugs and who had a reputation for DUIs, frequenting strip clubs and getting robbed. His divorce would be finalized the following year. His daughter would die the next. In January 2007, responding to a complaint that he hadn't paid his settlement with a woman who claimed he harassed her at a greyhound track, Whittaker issued a statement to the Kanawha County Circuit Court, saying, ""On 9-11, a team of crooks went to 12 different (City National Banks) cashed 12 (checks) and got all my money."" ""I intend to pay but can't without any money,"" the statement said. Whittaker, of course, is the poster man for lottery winners forced off the tracks, and, certainly, there are many happy lottery winners who took their winnings and quietly went about their lives without so much as another headline in the local newspaper. Perhaps shockingly, however, about 70% of those incurring a financial windfall lose that money within a few years, according to the National Endowment for Financial Education. As we await the name of the person who purchased the winning $400 million Powerball ticket in Lexington, South Carolina, it's worth a reminder that sudden fortune isn't the panacea it's sometimes made out to be. Not only can seemingly unlimited income stoke temptations to spurn moderation, but lottery winners may also find friends and family members treating them more like a mark than a loved one, said Michael Boone, a Bellevue, Washington, wealth manager who spoke to CNN after the winners of the $656 million Mega Millions jackpot were announced last year. ""Anytime you're a public figure, you're going to attract attention from people who want to take things from you,"" he said. ""Most of us wouldn't be too happy if the amount of our paychecks was in the newspaper."" Charities begin soliciting. Self-styled entrepreneurs approach with pitches. Second cousins come looking for loans. Friends know someone who can help manage the money. ""That's not to say you wouldn't want to do something nice for those people, but it could become a full-time job,"" Boone said. His advice would be to remain anonymous, but only Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, North Dakota, South Carolina and Ohio allow winners to avoid state lottery publicity. (Michigan does in certain circumstances, but not for Powerball or Mega Millions winners.) Thus, Boone advises his clients to keep a low profile. As Michael Norton, associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, told CNN in 2011, ""When you become the rich person, who other people look to, it can actually erode the social bond that you have with people because it changes your relationship from friendship into almost like a transaction."" What's the worst that can happen, you ask? Well, Whittaker doesn't even provide the worst-case scenario. Earlier this year, Urooj Khan, a man described as a successful, hardworking Indian immigrant, died of cyanide poisoning the day after collecting $425,000 from a scratch-off lottery ticket. No arrest has been made. William ""Bud"" Post's own brother reportedly tried to kill him after he won $16.2 million in a 1988 Pennsylvania state lottery game. Though his brother was imprisoned, Post's reckless spending and behavior left him broke and divorced before he died in 2006 of respiratory failure. These are extremes, of course, but there are many cases of lesser tragedies befalling lottery winners. There's the British man who squandered a 2002 jackpot of 9.7 million pounds, much of it on cocaine and hookers, only to find himself working as garbage man again by 2010. And the St. Louis wig maker who won $18 million in 1993, only to spend so lavishly on political and philanthropic causes that she filed for bankruptcy four years later. Or the New Jersey woman who won the lottery twice -- a grand total of $5.4 million -- but was so helpless to avoid games of chance that she ended up in a trailer after giving the lion's share of her money to Atlantic City casinos. Jim McCullar saw spooky signs before he even collected half of his $380 million Mega Millions prize in Washington in 2011, telling CNN that he was reluctant to even come forward because ""all we saw were predators and we were afraid to do anything until we got down here with police protection."" Winning isn't always a curse, though. Lee McDaniel of Stone Mountain, Georgia, who won $5 million in the Georgia Lottery in 2010, said in an interview the following year that he didn't see any downside to the money. He'd helped his sister with medical bills, handed out money to other relatives, remodeled his home, bought an RV and Jeep, and invested a large chunk of the cash. ""I don't feel that I have changed. I am just very secure financially,"" he said. It's quite the contrast to Whittaker, and while most lottery winners' experiences fall somewhere between McDaniel's and Whittaker's, it's safe to say no one wants to follow the latter's path post-millions. No one should ever have to tell ABC News, as Whittaker did five years after his windfall, that they'd be better off without the money. ""Since I won the lottery, I think there is no control for greed,"" he told the station. ""I think if you have something, there's always someone else that wants it. I wish I'd torn that ticket up."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Elizabeth Landau, Greg Botelho and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","Jack Whittaker of West Virginia became a broken-down man after winning $314 million .

"(CNN) -- ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" is being called so bad, it hurts. ""Hello, police? I'd like to report an assault,"" begins The Seattle Times review. ""Down at the MegaGigaGrandePlex, and it's still going on. Come quick! I barely escaped with my life. The perp? Michael Bay. He gave me a full-body beatdown. His weapon? 'Transformers: Age of Extinction.' "" The fourth installment of Michael Bay's toys-to-big-screen franchise is supposed to press reset on the story with a new leading man -- Mark Wahlberg in for Shia LaBeouf -- but critics haven't fallen for it. While Bay has said that he envisions ""Age of Extinction"" to be the launching pad for a new ""Transformers"" trilogy to follow the one led by LaBeouf -- which included ""Transformers"" (2007); ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" (2009); and ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" (2011) -- the question critics have asked is whether there needs to be a new trilogy at all. Wahlberg stars in ""Age of Extinction"" as Texan Cade Yeager, an inventor and single dad of a teen daughter (Nicola Peltz). He accidentally stumbles upon Optimus Prime when he picks up an old truck. Set four years after the events of ""Dark of the Moon,"" Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots are now being targeted for elimination, spearheading showdowns between the Autobots and their allies -- Cade, his daughter, and her boyfriend (Jack Reynor) -- and, well, everyone else. As Wahlberg said at the premiere, ""Age of Extinction"" is built to be ""bigger and better, but also (with) more story (and) more character. And a whole new threat not only to the humans but also to the Autobots."" The good news is that more than one critic thought ""Extinction"" really is better than some of the prior ""Transformers"" installments, although that sentiment wasn't shared by all. USA Today, for example, found ""Extinction"" to be ""deafening, deadening and about two hours too long ... (the) weakest installment yet of the 7-year-old Hasbro franchise if the previous three movies were discernible from one another."" But the real issue, as several point out, is the absurdly long running time. ""You can admire what (Bay) does without really enjoying it,"" says the New York Times' A.O. Scott.

"(CNN) -- Perhaps the most frightening statistic attached to Lionel Messi is the fact that he's only 26. Another day, another record broken. Messi became Barcelona's all-time leading scorer Sunday after his hat-trick helped Tata Martino's team to a 7-0 victory over Osasuna. Messi, who has now scored 371 goals, eclipsed the record set by Paulino Alcantara, who scored 369 goals in 357 appearances between 1912-1927. It is the sixth consecutive season in which he has scored 30 goals -- not bad for a man who has been accused of not reaching the exorbitant levels which he has set in years past. His 25th hat-trick for Barcelona ensured his side moved to win four points of league leader Real Madrid ahead of ""El Clasico"" next weekend. Osasuna simply had no answer to Barcelona's attacking prowess as the home side thrashed its lowly opponent. Alexis Sanchez, Andres Iniesta, Cristian Tello and Pedro were all on target at Camp Nou. Messi's first hat-trick since the Champions League win over Ajax in September 2013 could scarcely have come at a better time for Barca. Martino's men must gain a result at Real next weekend to have any chance of retaining its league title . ""I think we can beat Real Madrid in the Bernabeu and that would put us right in the fight for La Liga,"" Sanchez told Canal Plus. ""Both teams will see themselves as favorites, they are the two biggest clubs in the world and it will be a great game. We are going to the Bernabeu with only the intention of winning."" Elsewhere, Sevilla defeated Real Valladolid 4-1 and Real Sociedad recorded a 1-0 victory over Valencia. Misery for Milan . Meanwhile, in Italy, AC Milan fell to a third consecutive league defeat which all but ends its chances of qualifying for European competition next season. Milan, 12th, was beaten 4-2 by Parma with Antonio Cassano scoring twice on a painful afternoon for the Rossoneri. The game couldn't have started much worse for Milan, which lost goalkeeper Christian Abbiati inside the opening nine minutes. Abbiati was adjudged to have brought down Ezequiel Schelotto and was promptly dismissed before Cassano slotted away the penalty. Cassano added a second after the interval but Milan rallied and Adil Rami headed home Kaka's corner to give the home side hope. And when Mario Balotelli equalized with 14 minutes remaining from the penalty spot, the comeback looked on for Clarence Seedorf's side. But disaster struck just two minutes later when Amauri flicked home Schelotto's cross to restore Parma's lead. Jonathan Biabiany's diving header in the fifth minute of stoppage time sealed the win and condemned Milan to yet more misery. Milan, which was dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid last week, is now 11 points behind Parma, which sits in the first Europa League spot. Meanwhile, Juventus grabbed a dramatic late victory at Genoa thanks to Andrea Pirlo's 89th minute free kick. Genoa gave the league leader a fierce fight before going down 1-0 -- a result which leaves Juventus 17 points clear at the top of Serie A. Elsewhere, Lazio claimed a 2-0 win at Cagliari, Sassuolo beat Catania 3-1 and Fiorentina defeated Chievo by the same scoreline. Monaco menace . In France, Monaco kept up the pressure on league leader Paris Saint-Germain with a 3-2 win at Lyon. Valere Germain, James Rodriguez and Dimitar Berbatov got the goals for Monaco, which sits second in the table. Jimmy Briand scored twice for Lyon which finishes the weekend in fifth place. PSG gained a 2-0 win over Saint Etienne in the day's late game courtesy of two goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

"(CNN) -- Harry Devert's motorcycle journey from the United States to Latin America is somewhat reminiscent of ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" which recount the South American travels of revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara on an old motorbike in search of his insurgent spirit. But Devert, 32, who left a job as a trader in finance to travel the world, has not been in touch with his mother or girlfriend in New York since January 25. That day he sent girlfriend Sarah Ashley Schiear an ominous text via the WhatsApp messenger app. ""Just got an hour and a half long escort out of some area it was too dangerous for me to be,"" the message said. ""Stopping for lunch and ... voila Internet. ... Gonna get back on the road soon. Apparently there's another military escort waiting for me in some other town... I'm running way late because of the crazy military stuff...hopefully get a chance to talk to you tonight when I (hopefully) finally arrive."" He had checked out of a bed and breakfast in the southwestern Mexican state of Michoacan and planned to travel to a beach in Zihuatanejo, on the Pacific coast, that was in the final scene of the film ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" according to friends and family. ""My son is a great communicator and he always lets me know -- because I'm anxious -- as close as he can where he's going to be or if he's going to be out of touch,"" his mother, Ann Devert, told CNN Saturday. Ann Devert said she last heard from her son January 23. The phone connection was poor. He told her he'd be out of cell phone and Internet range a few days. She said he called every January 29, his late father's birthday, ""and when he didn't, I felt a misgiving but I thought maybe it would take a couple of days,"" she said. ""He didn't call."" Then, Ann Devert heard from a friend who recently returned from Michoacan, where vigilante self-defense groups in numerous communities have engaged in deadly confrontations with the Knights Templar drug cartel. After vigilantes threatened to descend on a key cartel area last month, the Mexican government sent in thousands of troops and police to try to keep the peace. The government has even joined forces with the vigilantes as the Knights Templar become further entrenched in the agricultural state. ""This is an area in Michoacan that has been very dangerous,"" said Ann Devert, who has been in contact with The Missing Americans Project, a Website dedicated to sharing information and resources about U.S. citizens missing in other countries. Last week, Ann Devert contacted both the American and French embassies in Mexico. Her son, born in France, has dual citizenship. ""The wheels of diplomatic work sometimes grind slowly,"" she lamented. ""They are on top of things as much as they can be."" Schiear, 28, was less diplomatic. ""I just feeling pretty lost in terms of the help we are receiving,"" she said. In a statement Saturday, a U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed that a U.S. citizen was reported missing near Morelia, Michoacan, but declined further comment ""due to privacy considerations."" ""When a U.S. citizen is reported missing in Mexico, the U.S. Embassy or Consulate works with both the missing person's family and Mexican and U.S. law enforcement agencies to locate the missing individual and return him or her to safety,"" the statement said. ""For missing person cases in Mexico, Mexican law enforcement institutions generally have jurisdiction and play the lead role in the conduct of investigations. We work closely with Mexican authorities to monitor such cases and seek progress as quickly as possible."" In Mexico, Interior Ministry officials told CNN that they have not yet confirmed that Devert is missing. Devert's friends and family remain hopeful that his disappearance is only temporary, another story to recount from his wild travels around the world -- from Pamplona, Spain, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and beyond. ""I've been chased with a gun in Colombia, chipped my tooth on a gun that was shoved in my mouth in Venezuela and shot everything from a bazooka to a machine gun, an M16 to a Colt .45,"" Devert wrote in his travel blog, A New Yorker Travels. ""I've been in some of the poorest and some of the most dangerous parts of the world and to many of the finest, and I still can't tell which I liked more. I think that life is a pilgrimage."" In an Oct. 19 post, Devert described his latest journey on a type of vehicle he had no experience using. ""I've never ridden a motorcycle,"" he wrote. ""Mostly, naturally, because I don't know how. So tomorrow I'm going to go to the DMV, get my motorcycle permit, buy a bike and hopefully figure out how to ride it home without crashing. Which I'm sure will be an adventure in itself."" He added, ""Then in the next 2 or 3 weeks I'm going to drive it across America, through Central America, down to Brazil for the World Cup, and eventually south to Ushuaia, which as far as I can tell from a map is about as far south as one can get on the continent."" He purchased a green 2002 Kawasaki. Ann Devert said her son took a safety course and spent hours studying YouTube videos on how to survive falls from bikes. Still, the fact that he had never driven a motorcycle concerned her, she said. He promised not to travel faster than 55 mph, yet he took a nasty spill while speeding in Florida, Ann Devert said. He emerged unscathed. ""He always tells me 'I take risks but I'm not an idiot,'"" she said. Devert hoped to write about his experiences traveling around Latin America, perhaps in a book. ""My son was hoping that instead of a job in an office that he'd be able to somehow use this trip to get enough followers who would maybe read a book that he would write,"" Ann Devert said. ""He's had some extraordinary adventures. He just loves people so."" Schiear said Devert spent the last year saving money for the journey. ""This trip was kind of him wanting to make it maybe a career or something,"" she said. ""This is what he loved. He wanted to try to figure out a way to keep doing it. He started a website and everything."" Friends and family recently created the Help Find Harry page in Facebook, with more than 5,000 likes. ""He's one of those people that every single person that he comes into contact with just loved him,"" said Schiear, who planned to meet Devert in Guatemala. ""Everywhere that he's been around the world, families took him in. Everybody's hoping that's ... the end of this crazy story. Somebody has taken him in, and it'll be another one of his wild stories.""

"(Parenting) -- To deal with her depression and anxiety issues, J.D. Bailey does not use prescription drugs. She uses the delicate-fabrics setting on the dryer. Four years ago, Bailey was prescribed a low dose of Zoloft to offset the postpartum depression that followed the birth of her youngest daughter, Grace. Her doctor later switched the script to Celexa. Thus began a carousel of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Today, Bailey is not taking anything. For the past few months, her drug of choice has been five minutes in the laundry room. ""Last week I had to step away when my 6-year-old, Annie, was having a full meltdown,"" says Bailey, who chronicles her depression on her blog, Honest Mom. ""I felt like the worst parent in the world because I didn't want to make her feel better. I just wanted to get out of there."" Parenting.com: How to de-stress your daily routine . So that's what she did. Bailey went into the laundry room, turned on the dryer, and breathed until ""I knew I could be levelheaded, hug her, and talk her through it."" Bailey lives in a suburb of Boston, where children ride bikes in front of split-level colonial homes and locals make brownies for the neighborhood bake sale. It's the kind of charmed hamlet that teaches an important lesson: Depression and anxiety live everywhere. One in every 10 Americans reports being depressed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Anxiety disorders affect 40 million adults in the U.S. But parents are arguably the most vulnerable to these issues. ""Parenting is a tough job, one that is exhausting on a good day,"" says Jenn Berman, a licensed psychotherapist in Beverly Hills and author of ""The A to Z Guide to Raising Happy, Confident Kids."" ""If you're also prone to depression, it can push you over the edge."" Parenting, anxiety and depression . From our children's health to their development to their performance at school, there's always something for moms and dads to be happy -- or anxious -- about. The common definition of depression states that a multitude of the following symptoms be present for a two-week period: fatigue and decreased energy, feelings of pessimism, overeating or appetite loss, insomnia or early-morning wakefulness, loss of interest in hobbies and activities once found pleasurable, and irritability and restlessness. That describes half the parents I know. Our awareness of depressive and anxiety issues is at an all-time high (thank you, TV commercials), and our family physicians and OB-GYNs can write scripts as easily as psychiatrists. It all adds up to our becoming Generation Medication: More than one in five American adults now take at least one type of medication to treat a psychological or behavioral disorder, a 22% rise since 2001, according to an analysis by Express Scripts. The number of women taking antidepressants grew 29% between 2001 and 2010; during that same time period, ADHD drug use among women jumped a staggering 264%. Parenting.com: Why are so many moms on psychiatric meds? But very little talk surrounding depression and anxiety focuses on parents, which is hard to believe, since their mental well-being has a significant effect on our most precious cargo. ""Depression...can have serious biological, psychological, behavioral, and social consequences, especially on children who rely on a parent for caregiving, support, and nurturance,"" according to ""Depression in Parents, Parenting and Children,"" published in 2009 by the National Research Council. It's associated with poorer physical health, especially in infants, difficult temperament and aggression, lower cognitive performance, and higher rates of anxiety and depression. Sixteen million children are living in households with a depressed parent, so there are an enormous number of young lives at stake. 'Put on your own oxygen mask first' It's 3 a.m., and Hope Chanda is awakened by another panic attack. Not again, she thinks. But sure enough, the symptoms are all there: tightening in the chest, pressure on the rib cage, shortness of breath. ""Every time, I feel like I'm going to die,"" she says. For the past two years, Chanda and her husband, Joe, parents of twin 6-year-old boys in Melbourne, Florida, have been trying to get pregnant: six rounds of fertility shots and three cycles of the fertility drug Clomid. ""All the hormones made me crazy,"" she adds. But toughest of all were the two miscarriages. ""After the second miscarriage, it all came out,"" she says. ""I had this feeling that something was really wrong.."" She didn't want to end up like her mother, who was hospitalized for anxiety issues when Chanda was 10. Parenting.com: Mom confession: I'm an alcoholic parent . ""You know how on an airplane the flight attendant says to put on your own oxygen mask first, then your child's? That applies here,"" Berman says. ""It's really hard for moms to put their well-being first, but they have to help themselves before they can help their children and families."" After one too many midnight panic attacks, Chanda talked to her family doctor. Now she takes half a milligram of Xanax twice a day, and 20 milligrams of Celexa at night. ""It helps me be a better mom,"" says Chanda. ""I look forward to taking my medication. I'm more flexible, tolerant, and rational. Before, when the kids were being a problem, I would get frustrated and yell immediately. Now, we work through the problem."" Allan Horwitz is a professor of sociology at Rutgers University and author of ""The Loss of Sadness: How Psychiatry Transformed Normal Sadness Into Depressive Disorder."" He believes we're using meds to deal with the emotional roller coaster of parenthood. ""Let's say you have a colicky baby,"" says Horwitz. ""Colic means your baby is not sleeping, which means you're not sleeping. Now you have resulting symptoms from thatâ€”fatigue, irritability, feeling overwhelmed.... We've become less tolerant of negative emotions. It's much easier to take a pill."" 'Sad and I don't know why' Every morning John Buffington, a father of two in Philadelphia, pops a Claritin and 20 milligrams of Celexa. ""While it was different for my dad's generation, I'm taking on a more nurturing role at home. To do that, you have to be in touch with your feelings,"" says Buffington as he gives his 9-month-old son a bottle. ""Celexa helps me do that."" What about talk therapy? ""I spent a couple years in therapy, but then the insurance stopped covering it and it became too big of an expense."" This is a common scenario: Getting the medication is relatively cheap and easy, and talk therapy is expensive and hard. If the meds make you feel normal, why do anything else? ""You should not take psychiatric medication unless you are in psychotherapy,"" says Dr. Carole Lieberman, a psychiatrist and faculty member at UCLA's Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. ""The medication is a Band-Aid to combat the symptoms while you work on the root of the problem."" ""If your partner is dealing with these issues, push them to start -- and stick with -- talk therapy,"" says Berman. ""Therapists give you the tools to manage your triggers."" Parenting.com: When postpartum depression lasts . One evening at bedtime, Bailey's daughter Annie said, ""Mommy, I'm sad and I don't know why."" Her heart sank.

""I'm exercising, eating better, and making sure my spouse and I have time together,"" she says. Things are going well, but she's on eggshells.

"(CNN) -- Denmark produced the first major surprise of Euro 2012 as Morten Olsen's side secured a 1-0 win over the Netherlands in Kharkiv. Famed for their Total Football approach, the World Cup finalists were left totally frustrated by a Danish side that was never fazed by the star-studded reputation of Bert van Marwijk's team. Michael Khron-Delhi scored the only goal of the game to leave Holland -- one of Euro 2012's heavyweights -- a real challenge to qualify from Group B and reach the knockout stages. Van Marjwik's side next play Germany, who beat Portugal 1-0 in Lviv thanks to Mario Gomez's second-half goal, in a game that never matched the drama of Denmark's victory. Denmark 1-0 Holland . Billed as Group B's rank outsiders, Denmark had to ride their luck against a Dutch team that dominated possession for long periods in Kharkiv's Metalist Stadium. Amid those lucky breaks though Simon Kjaer and Daniel Agger in central defence showed plenty of steel and when the Danes did get hold of the ball they produced some intricate passing moves. Danish goalkeeper Stephan Andersen was also outstanding, notably when he thwarted Dutch substitute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar after the Schalke forward was sent clear by Wesley Sneijder's wonderful pass with the outside of his right foot. That Huntelaar. who scored 48 goals in all competitions last season for the German Bundesliga club, was left on the bench by Van Marwijk was the first surprise of Saturday's game. Before he was introduced in the second half, Huntelaar could only watch as Robin van Persie's eye for a goal went missing. A frustrating evening for the Dutch striker, who has scored 30 goals in the English Premier League for Arsenal this season, was encapsulated when he completely miskicked the ball early in the second half. Van Persie should have scored early on in the game but put his shot wide and later on in the first half the Arsenal striker was thwarted by Danish goalkeeper Stephan Andersen's alertness. Completely against the run of play, Krohn-Dehli gave Denmark a shock lead after he gathered Simon Poulsen's deflected cross and drilled a shot through the legs of Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. Arjen Robben then curled a left-footed shot against the post as Denmark's goal continued to lead somewhat of a charmed life. The second half mirrored the first with the Dutch pinning the Danes in their own half, but the Danes refused to be cowed and after surviving a late handball appeal against Lars Jacobsen, Olsen's team held on to secure a memorable victory. Germany 1-0 Portugal . Saturday's second game had been billed as one of the most intriguing of the Euro 2012's group stages but it rarely failed to live up to the pre-match hype. It offered the tournament a first glimpse of Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 60 goals for Real Madrid this season, but as to often the Portuguese forward flickered in and out of an international for his country -- in truth more out than in. Ronaldo has scored only five goals in 19 appearances during major internatioal tournaments and with Portugal adopting a strategy of containment he was never able to significantly influence the game. It was not until late in the second half that he forced Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer into a save and for the most part Germany were able to minimize the Portuguese forward's threat. Soon after making that save Neuer had a fortunate escape when he misjudged Nani's looping cross, allowing the ball to bounce off the bar. The Bayern Munich goalkeeper quickly recovered his poise to brilliantly save from substitute Silvestre Varela, who had been set up by Nelson Oliveira's ingenious reverse pass. Nani then had a rising shot blocked by Holger Badstuber as Portugal finally put Germany under sustained pressure for the first time in search of an equaliser. Given that late surge of Portuguese attacking activity the question is why Paulo Bento's side only started to test Germany's defense after having gone a goal behind. Germany had arguably shaded a forgettable first-half, with Gomez going close early on with a header that was well saved by Rui Patricio, though Portuguese defender Pepe did hit the upright with a clever shot following a corner. But it was Gomez who finally broke the deadlock, connecting with Sami Khedira's cross from the right, cleverly guiding a header past Patricio.","Denmark deliver first major surprise of Euro 2012 with win over the Netherlands .

"(CNN) -- It was a gruesome act performed atop the stage of the global theater -- the grotesque image of a masked man, dressed all in black, beheading an American journalist in a production intended to strike terror into the hearts of millions around the world. This act of sadism was horrific enough on its own. But what some will also find deeply disturbing was that the jihadist executioner communicated his threat with a distinct London accent. The realization that there are people who grew up in Britain who are prepared to engage in such barbaric acts of depravity makes James Foley's murder feel more intimate than if it was perpetrated by a foreign-sounding killer from a different society. Propaganda films from ISIS -- the Sunni militant group that has seized large tracts of land in Syria and Iraq in recent months -- regularly feature British recruits to demonstrate the group's capacity to influence young Muslims living in Europe. Earlier this week another threatening video from ISIS featured a group of jihadists speaking with British accents as they interrogated a Japanese hostage. Some of them weren't even hiding their faces. The beheading of Foley was staged as a ""Message to America,"" but it constituted a direct warning to Britain. It served as a reminder that the killing of a young English soldier Lee Rigby on the streets of south London by two home-grown jihadists last year was not an isolated event. There has been a dramatic shift since September 11, 2001 in the way that the risk of terrorism is perceived in Britain and Western societies. Western governments have been forced to confront an unexpected and deeply disturbing reality -- that it is sometimes the people already living in these societies who constitute the greatest security threat. The emergence of the ""home grown terrorist"" raises the fundamental question -- why do these radicalized jihadists reject the values and ways of life of the societies they inhabit? Thankfully only a small fraction of a minority of young radical Muslims turn into hardened executioners of innocent victims. But a far greater number reject, even loathe, the cultural values of British society. Many radical Muslims aren't fervent ISIS supports -- but some do regard the war to establish a global caliphate as a cause worth supporting. Their response is integral to an uncomfortable reality that British society ignores at its peril. Losing the battle of ideas . Since the terrorist bombings in London in July 2005, the challenge of winning hearts and minds has been evident to policy makers. At the time, British Prime Minister Tony Blair declared: . ""It's important, however, that those engaged in terrorism realize that our determination to defend our values and our way of life is greater than their determination to cause death and destruction to innocent people in a desire to impose extremism on the world."" Unfortunately very little progress has been made in upholding and explaining the values and way of life that are at stake -- and the shallowness of this statement was exposed a few years year later when the government's plans to launch a British Day had to be quietly abandoned. The idea for organizing a British Day was a direct response to the London bombings. At the time, Chancellor Gordon Brown stated: . ""We have to face uncomfortable facts that while the British response to July 7th was remarkable, they were British citizens, British born apparently integrated into our communities, who were prepared to maim and kill fellow British citizens irrespective of their religion. ""We have to be clearer now about how diverse cultures which inevitably contain differences can find the essential common purpose also without which no society can flourish."" Sadly the government failed to give meaning to the idea of this ""common purpose"" and gave up on the idea. The very attempt to celebrate ""Britishness"" only revealed an absence of clarity of what it was that ought to be valued and celebrated. The answer to the question of what it means to be British continues to elude policy makers. Prime Minister David Cameron has called for teaching Britishness in school, in response to recent allegations about radical Islamist influence in the classroom. But if political leaders find it difficult to explain what Britishness represents, then how can teachers be expected to instruct their pupils? Unless British values actually mean something in public life they cannot be taught. This is a challenge that has been evaded during the past decade. After the tragic murder of James Foley, this challenge must no longer be avoided. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frank Furedi.","ISIS releases video showing the beheading of journalist James Foley .

"(CNN) -- There's a standard Atlantic City itinerary: arrive at one of the many casinos along the Boardwalk, head straight for the card tables and slot machines, drink some complimentary cocktails and proceed to empty your wallet. Sometimes it feels like it would be easier to cut out the middleman and simply hand over your money directly to the dealer because, let's face it, the odds are not in your favor. But don't let this dissuade you from visiting Atlantic City. Even if you're not a gambler, good times can still be had in this iconic Jersey Shore spot, which has largely bounced back from the devastation wrought by Superstorm Sandy. Atlantic City falls somewhere in between Vegas' glitz and Reno's grime, and you can find a bit of either, depending on your taste. There are a myriad of eating, drinking, sightseeing and shopping options, both inside and outside the casinos. So venture past the slot machines and try some of the following activities to see what AC truly has to offer beyond gambling. Belly up to the bar at local watering holes . Sure, Atlantic City's casinos offer a glut of nightclubs and ritzy bars with bottle service and pounding sound systems. But for a cheaper drinking experience with more character, check out the city's local dive bars and pubs. Many are open 24 hours for those who wish to imbibe until the sun rises. You might even chat with some regulars at places such as Culmone's (2437 Atlantic Ave.; 609-348-5170), a pleasantly seedy establishment a few blocks off the Boardwalk. If you're looking for some bar food to wash down your beer, try the Irish Pub (164 St. James Place; 609-344-9064) or Pic-A-Lilli (231 S. Tennessee Ave.; 609-344-1113) -- both offer wings, burgers and more, with a hearty dollop of local flavor on the side. Pretend you're an extra on 'Boardwalk Empire' The Knife and Fork Inn (3600 Atlantic Ave.; 609-344-1133) was a Prohibition-era speakeasy and restaurant. It frequently played host to a gang of colorful characters, including the real-life Nucky Johnson (the inspiration for the HBO show's Nucky Thompson character), before being raided and shut down by the feds. It soon reopened, and the restaurant is still going strong today, having been fully renovated and restored in 2005. It's an elegant place to enjoy a steak, some seafood, a martini or two and soak in the aura of the Roaring '20s. Get curious about history . If you're in the mood to do some historical sightseeing in the greater Atlantic City area, there are several interesting landmarks. Just south of town, in Margate, sits Lucy the Elephant, a six-story high National Historic Landmark. Lucy was originally constructed in 1881. Today, visitors can take guided tours inside the novelty pachyderm. Admission is $8 for adults, $4 for children ages 3 to 12, free for children younger than 3. Margate is also home to Marven Gardens, a neighborhood of beautifully restored houses from the '20s and '30s. The Monopoly property, Marvin Gardens, is actually a misspelling of the name, an error Parker Brothers acknowledged in 1995. Absecon Lighthouse juts up prominently from the north side of Atlantic City. Dating back to 1857, this is New Jersey's tallest lighthouse and visitors can climb to the top for a view of the ocean and surrounding landscape. Admission is $7 for adults, $4 for children ages 4 to 12, free for children younger than 4. The Steel Pier doesn't look much like it did in the early 20th century, but it has entertained visitors for over 100 years and is home to an array of modern rides, games and food vendors. Single tickets can be purchased for $1, or discounted books of 35, 80 or 200 tickets are available. Take a dip . The gently sloping beach along the Atlantic City Boardwalk is surprisingly appealing and clean. When the weather is nice, you can find swimmers enjoying the warm water and calm surf, as well as surfers and kayakers. From July 1 through Labor Day, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., there are lifeguards stationed on the beach from Caspian Avenue to Jackson Avenue. So grab a towel and some sunscreen, and claim your spot early. Look at the fishes, or catch them . The Atlantic City Aquarium is a great place to take kids (it also hosts birthday parties), with exhibits featuring a bevy of fascinating fish and aquatic mammals. It's located right on the waterfront at historic Gardner's Basin, where you can dine at dockside restaurants and check out the Atlantic City artists' colony. Charter sightseeing, dolphin watching and fishing boats leave from the marina. Admission to the Aquarium is $8 for adults, $6 for seniors, $5 for children 4 to 12 and free for children 3 and younger. Get some culture . It turns out Atlantic City is not entirely devoid of high culture. Artlantic is a project curated by Fung Collaboratives that turns vacant green spaces along the Atlantic City Boardwalk into temporary art projects that change from year to year. The project began in 2012 and will last until 2016. There are two art park locations, both an easy walk from the casinos, one between Martin Luther King Boulevard and Indiana Avenue and another on the Boardwalk at California Avenue. Indulge . This year's Atlantic City Food and Wine Festival takes place from July 25 to 27 at Caesars and features copious amounts of food, drink, parties and cocktails as well as talks and demonstrations from celebrity chefs. Packages are available to book now, starting at $250. Learn to gamble . This might seem like a cheat, but technically it's not gambling. Some casinos, such as the Trump Taj Mahal, offer instructional lessons in their poker rooms. According to the casino's FAQ, you can ask the shift manager to set up a free private or group lesson. Who knows, you might learn a thing or two for when you decide to hit the tables for real. Of course, the house doesn't like to lose, so maybe hold off the high-limit tables for just a little while. Explore beyond the tables . There is plenty to do inside Atlantic City's casinos besides gambling. Take in a music or comedy show, pamper yourself at an upscale spa, eat at one of the many posh restaurants or budget buffets or embark on an epic shopping spree. If consumerism is your preferred method of relaxation, you've come to the right place. The Quarter at the Tropicana is an Old Havana-themed cluster of shops, restaurants and nightlife, nostalgically hearkening back to the days of pre-Castro Cuba. The Pier Shops at Caesars is another area where you can spend a few hours away from the casino floor eating, shopping or watching The Water Show, a Vegas-style water, light and sound extravaganza that pops off once every hour (check with the hotel first, it is occasionally out of service). Walk the Boardwalk . Finally, take a leisurely stroll down the entire length of the Atlantic City Boardwalk, a tourist attraction that dates back to the late 1800s. On one side lies the Atlantic Ocean, stretching out behind the dunes and grass, and on the other are countless casinos, stores, novelty shops and fast-food joints. This summer, free events such as a concert by country singer Blake Shelton (July 31) and AVP pro volleyball (September 5-7) will take place along the Boardwalk. Settle in for some serious people watching. A diverse mass of humanity descends every summer, from Indian-American parades to teenage skaters to extended families from Ohio, all enjoying the sea air perfumed by the scent of fried dough and cotton candy.","Atlantic City has some of the glitz of Vegas and the grime of Reno .
It also has oceanfront lounging, a historic boardwalk and public art parks .

"(CNN) -- After just one season as a cast member on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live,"" Brooks Wheelan took to Twitter on Monday to announce his firing from the hit comedy show. ""Had a blast and loved every second of it,"" Wheelan tweeted. ""I'm totally honored to be able to make this next joke... FIRED FROM NEW YORK IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!"" Though Wheelan's time on the show ended quickly after he was placed in the controversial new talent lineup that was introduced last year, the 27-year-old, who made several appearances on ""Weekend Update,"" is not the first cast member to have their time cut short. Former ""SNL"" cast members provide hope for future opportunity in his television career. In 2009, Michaela Watkins and Casey Wilson were dropped from the show, but both can still be seen all over pop culture. Watkins now stars on ABC's ""Trophy Wife"" while Wilson went on to star as a lead actress in ""Happy Endings"" for over 50 episodes. Fired twice during his time at ""SNL,"" Chris Parnell now stars in ""Suburgatory"" and ""Glee."" In 2010, ""SNL"" cast member Jenny Slate was let go after cursing on the show. Her stint lasted only one season as well. She now stars in the critically-acclaimed movie ""Obvious Child."" Launched back in 1975, ""SNL"" has been home to some of the most famous and beloved comic talent, including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Chris Rock and Jimmy Fallon, to name a few. SNL would not comment on Wheelan's departure, with a representative explaining that the show does not discuss casting changes. Heading into the show's 40th season, ""SNL"" executive producer Lorne Michaels recently hinted at some staff shakeup. Last week, the late-night institution was nominated for 14 Emmy Awards.

"Washington (CNN) -- Leticia Van de Putte, a Democrat running for the second-highest office in Texas, received an endorsement Wednesday that gives her campaign needed exposure and fund-raising opportunities. Howard Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and his organization, Democracy for America, endorsed Van de Putte for lieutenant governor of Texas in an e-mail to the group's 1 million members, including more than 38,000 in Texas. ""This year we have the best opportunity in a generation to turn Texas blue,"" Dean said, referring to Van de Putte and Wendy Davis, the Texas gubernatorial candidate and liberal star. ""In Wendy Davis and Leticia Van de Putte, we have the right team to seize that opportunity and defeat the extreme right."" The organization endorsed Davis immediately after she announced her candidacy in October. But the group waited six months before giving Van de Putte the nod. The organization wanted to ensure that Van de Putte's campaign, with its much lower profile, was capable of winning in the reliably red state. ""We decided to back Leticia Van de Putte after running our endorsement process and seeing ... how excited our members in Texas are about a Davis-Van de Putte one-two punch and watching her put together the kind of grassroots campaign that we're confident can win in the Lone Star State,"" Neil Sroka with Democracy for America wrote in an e-mail. Van de Putte welcomed the endorsement, thanking Democracy for America for its ""grass-roots support."" Democrats are cautiously optimistic about their chances in Texas this year, noting that they have two top-notch candidates who could pull off an upset. While Davis has excited progressives around the country with her 13-hour filibuster last June over abortion access, Van de Putte has her own lengthy legislative record, and Democrats insist she, as a Latino, is the ideal candidate to motivate women and Latinos to vote. Meet the woman who could turn Texas purple . Persuading Texas Democrats to vote is its own challenge. The Lone Star State, where more than one-third of the population is Hispanic, is plagued with low voter turnout. Nearly two-thirds of eligible Latino voters stayed home in 2012. And the numbers get worse in nonpresidential election years. Van de Putte's challenger is still undetermined. Current Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick are locked in a runoff contest for the Republican nomination. Both candidates are running to the right, making immigration a central component of their campaigns, which Democrats say could also help drive Latinos to the polls. Van de Putte must raise significant amounts of money to be competitive in the vast, populous state. The latest fund-raising figures available are old -- from January -- but total a mere $290,000. Democracy For America raised more than $50,000 for Davis in the first 24 hours after its endorsement. That's an extremely high bar to match for a Van de Putte endorsement, but obviously one her campaign hopes is reached.","Leticia Van de Putte is a Democrat running for lieutenant governor in Texas .

"(CNN) -- Alfred Matthew Yankovic has come a long way from the teen chopping up '70s disco hits for the Dr. Demento radio comedy hour. Over the years, he's taught us everything from where to buy quilts at a discount price to what teen spirit smells like. But now, ""Weird Al"" is no longer just doing funny spoofs of Madonna and Michael Jackson; he's educating the Internet on how to properly use the Oxford comma. While he's sold more than 12 million albums, earned three Grammys and racked up four gold records, Yankovic may be at his artistic peak with the sublime new single, ""Word Crimes."" Yankovic has turned Robin Thicke's not so humble brag about his dangling participle into something that could follow in the grand tradition of ""Schoolhouse Rock"" and, he says, ""ostensibly be part of a school curriculum."" ""I've taken a song that people had a problem with because it was slightly misogynistic, and I made it into a song about grammar,"" Yankovic said in an interview with CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Wednesday. Yankovic molds Thicke's catchy, but borderline sexist, ""Blurred Lines"" into a linguistic piece de resistance, waxing grammatical about those who confuse irony and coincidence. Though Yankovic insisted that he loves all the songs equally off his new album, ""Mandatory Fun,"" when pressed, Yankovic said his tribute to the fundamentals of style ""might be"" his best track yet. The artist's dedication to proper English syntax seems to have struck a chord with the Internet at large. As of this writing, more than 2.5 million people took three minutes out of their day to watch Yankovic's lesson on literally versus figuratively. ""I'm not alone. I'm not the only grammar nerd out there,"" Yankovic said about the song's success. ""There's a lot of people who share my pain."" ""Word Crimes"" is the second of eight tracks Yankovic released on YouTube. The singer, rapper and musical virtuoso intends to release eight parodies in eight days to help promote his new record. But Yankovic politely deflects on whether he knows which tracks will connect with his audience. ""I love all the songs equally,"" Yankovic said. ""There's no lead single on this album because I don't know what people are going to respond to the most."" Whereas Yankovic's previous hits relied more on simple word substitution -- see ""Like a Surgeon"" or ""Fat"" -- his new songs are more textured. The artist partially credits his new freedom to how the music ecosystem has evolved since he emerged on the scene in the 1980s. ""MTV doesn't really stand for music television anymore,"" Yankovic said. ""The Internet is the new MTV."" Less concerned with the relatively rigid formula required to rhyme his way on to the bygone ""Total Request Live,"" Yankovic said taking record and television executives out of the equation has given him more musical latitude. ""It does allow me to try things I wouldn't have tried before,"" he said. ""Now, it's basically, 'What do I like? What do the fans like?'"" Watch The Lead with Jake Tapper weekdays at 4pm ET.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- On a bitterly cold December morning in 2011, we watched as the last U.S. troops crossed the border into Kuwait, ending America's war in Iraq. More than 100 vehicles were in that convoy, snaking its way across the desert and through the floodlit border crossing, leaving behind empty bases and memories of nearly 4,500 American lives that were lost. Americans breathed a sigh of relief. Many Iraqis held their breath. War, they feared, was far from over for them, and time has borne out their fears. The death and violence never stopped -- it's just that the bombs and bullets faded from American minds and television screens once the pull-out was complete. Two years later we're back in Iraq and things are in many ways worse for Iraqis than when the Americans left. READ MORE: The ""bad old days"" return in Baghdad . Driving in along what the U.S. military called ""Route Irish"" -- or the BIAP (Baghdad International Airport road) -- the stark concrete blast walls are now covered in murals, the median is grassed with palm trees and fountains. We were reminded this was done for the 2012 Arab League Summit in Baghdad, not for general ""beautification."" Those of us who'd been to Baghdad on multiple assignments were struck by the ubiquitous security presence -- police checkpoints and posts and army units on duty in some places. The traffic was always bad in Baghdad. Today, it's worse that we can remember. Locals talk of almost becoming accustomed to the threat of not coming home at night because of some random car bomb. READ MORE: 5 things to know about Iraq violence . More than 8,000 people were killed in Iraq in 2013, according to the U.N. estimates -- most of them innocent civilians caught up in the tempest of violence that grips their country. The groundwork for today's problems began almost as soon as that last American convoy left in 2011. Sunni lawmakers protested the rounding up of many of their aides and security guards, and the country's vice president -- top Sunni leader Tariq al-Hashimi -- faced arrest and later fled the country. The government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was supposed to usher in a political era of inclusion and reconciliation. His critics say those first days after the American departure were a signal of opposite intentions that have continued to this day. The Sunni minority that had ruled Iraq via the iron fist of Saddam Hussein was at the political and social mercy of al-Maliki's Shia-dominated government. Today, they say, ""inclusiveness"" never materialized, Sunnis have been marginalized and resentment has festered in a divide-and-conquer political climate. As one local put it, ""It's like if you're against us, you're a terrorist and we'll arrest you."" Why Iraq is in turmoil . This resentment, aided by the violent government shutdown of Sunni protest camps, provided an opening for the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to move into the Sunni heartland of Anbar Province in force. Al Qaeda is a beast that feasts on discontent and in Anbar there is no shortage of sustenance. A previous version of ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq, comprised the core insurgents the Americans fought in those cities during the war. They have regrouped and strengthened across the border in Syria during that country's bloody conflict -- and extended their fight for a home for their brand of hard-line Islamism into Iraq. The results have been deadly -- not just in Ramadi and Fallujah of course, but across the country, where, just like the ""bad old days"" of 2005-2009, bombings and killings have become pretty much daily events. READ MORE: At least 60 killed in Anbar since December 1 . In 2006 the Americans convinced -- and paid -- Sunni tribal and religious leaders to fight the hardliners, with great success. But Sunni grievances never went away and some in Anbar see ISIS as comrades-in-arms against an al-Maliki government viewed as an oppressor of Sunnis. Other Sunnis see al-Maliki as the lesser of two evils -- they don't like how they're treated, but like even less the ISIS brand of hard-line, brutal ""governance"". Al-Maliki has more than once termed the various fights and stand-offs in Ramadi and Fallujah as a fight against ""al Qaeda"", but it's not that simple. The Sunni sense of being under the heel of a sectarian government, of being cut out of the running of their country, failing to share in growing oil revenues, has nothing to do with al Qaeda and won't evaporate once ISIS is forced from Ramadi and Fallujah. The Americans aren't coming back to help out with boots on the ground, but they are giving other support -- offering drones, missiles, aircraft and other assistance. But this isn't a battle to be won militarily. Sunnis -- many of whom have yet to get used to no longer running the country -- say they want to be part of the system that was meant to be ""inclusive"" but has, they feel, been anything but.

"(CNN) -- More than half of all U.S. counties have been designated disaster zones, the Department of Agriculture reported, blaming excessive heat and a devastating drought that's spread across the Corn Belt and contributed to rising food prices. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack declared disaster zone designations for an additional 218 counties in 12 states Wednesday because of damage and losses caused by drought and excessive heat. The states are Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming. Nearly three-quarters of the nation's cattle acreage is now inside a drought-stricken area, as is about two-thirds of the country's hay acreage, the agency reported. Iowa farmers looking beyond drought . USDA researchers added that an average of 37% of the nation's soybeans were last week ranked from very poor to poor, the lowest quality recorded since a massive drought in 1988. Nearly half of America's corn crop was also rated very poor to poor, while 57% of its pastures and range land were similarly graded. This year's harsh conditions suggest that food prices next year could surge by as much as 4.5%, the agency reported. ""It's the most severe and expensive drought in 25 years,"" USDA economist Timothy Park said. As the hot and dry weather persists, farmers face potential losses in spite of federal crop insurance meant to soften the blow to U.S. agriculture. ""The pocketbook is really taking a hit,"" said Robert Dickey, a 58-year-old farmer in Georgia who says his losses are just below the threshold needed for his insurance to kick in. ""We'll probably have to take out some loans to get us through to next year."" Interactive map: Record dryness takes over the U.S. The price of milk, cheese and other dairy products is also expected to surge, while ranchers face steepening feed costs. ""When I was a kid in the '50s ... it got real dry, but nothing like this,"" said Marvin Helms, a 70-year-old farmer and rancher in central Arkansas who was compelled to sell his beef cattle after being short on feed. His thousand acres of farmland near Arkadelphia include corn and soybeans, which Helms says is normally sufficient to sustain his family and provide for his cattle. Farmer in the drought: If you plant it, it may not come . ""We've got some insurance on the crops, but it's not enough,"" he said. ""It will help, but it won't pay the bills."" Still, economists say the extent of federal insurance coverage -- which includes about 85% of the nation's crop acreage -- will help protect farmers against catastrophic income losses. ""Today's safety net is going to protect a lot more of those producers than in the past,"" said USDA Deputy Chief Economist Robert Johansson. ""Though it's hard to say the what effect will be on an individual producer, because a lot of times, these crop producers are also producing livestock."" Food prices on the rise . In an effort to bolster assistance, the USDA expanded emergency disaster assistance Wednesday to allow for haying and grazing on 3.8 million acres of protected conservation areas, once considered off-limits. The agency also reported that crop insurance companies have agreed to allow for a ""short grace period for farmers on insurance premiums in 2012,"" giving farmers an extra 30 days to make payments without interest penalties on their unpaid premiums. But while a variety of crops are strained across the U.S. Midwest, a top concern for policy-makers is corn. ""The unusually hot and dry conditions coincide with the period of pollination and kernel formation, which sharply reduces estimated yields,"" the USDA reported. ""As of July 17, approximately 88 percent of the corn crop was in regions impacted by drought."" About 75% of all food found in the supermarket contains corn, officials say.

"(CNN) -- With motor fluid spraying their faces and the weight of a car numbing their bodies, two Nevada college students struggled to stay calm after a drunk driver allegedly tore into their home, ripping them from their slumber. Kristin Palmer and Trent Wood were asleep in their home last week when a motorist allegedly drove into their bedroom around 4 a.m., mistakenly believing it was his ex-girlfriend's home. The University of Nevada students spent almost an hour pinned between the car and their bed while emergency workers battled furiously to free them. Somehow, the two left the scene with relatively minor scrapes and burns -- and a new lease on life, Wood said. ""When you experience something like that there's no limits anymore, you can try to do whatever you want to do,"" Wood told HLN's Mike Galanos. ""We feel like we have more of a purpose, like we were meant to live."" Authorities say the motorist was drunk when he drove into the couple's home in Sparks, mistakenly believing it was the home of his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend. Eric Cross is accused of drunken driving, battery with a deadly weapon, possession of a stolen vehicle, driving without a license and careless driving for his alleged role in the crash, which occurred October 21, according to the Washoe County Sheriff's Office. Initially, Woods struggled to comprehend what had happened to him after being abruptly torn from his slumber. ""I thought the roof caved in from an earthquake because it's an old house,"" Woods said. Then, his girlfriend began screaming and parts of the car came into focus, helping Woods to groggily piece the scene together, . ""I could see the tire to the right side and I was like, there's a car on top of me right now,"" he said. ""That was really hard to get through my head."" As fluid poured from the car, burning Palmer's face, the couple feared that the car might explode with them underneath, he said. Woods credited the slackness of the bed for preventing their legs from breaking altogether as the weight of the car pinned his girlfriend's entire body and his lower half to the bed. ""She was screaming really badly because I could actually move above my chest and neck, but she couldn't move anything,"" he said. The couple calmed down somewhat after emergency workers arrived at the scene, using chainsaws to rip through the wall, Wood said. About 42 minutes later, they had lifted the car enough to let the couple wiggle out from underneath it without it crushing their lower bodies. ""When the car was lifted and you could see blood circulating back through my legs, that was probably the happiest moment of my life: Yes! I'm not paralyzed,"" he said. ""I was so happy, hugging everyone and making sure Kristin was all right,"" he said. ""I was just real happy to get out of there."" The couple is accepting donations through the Bank of America to replace items lost in the incident.

"London, England (CNN) -- Can we all get a better deal by making purchases together? That's the idea behind a new breed of ""group buying"" Web sites -- at least one of which may be valued at more than $1 billion. It's hardly a stretch to predict that group buying will become one of the biggest Web trends of 2010, and the market leader will be one of the most closely-watched sites of the year. Groupon, which traces its origins back to 2008, has a simple premise: If enough people agree to buy something, they all get a big discount. Today's deal for those in New York: Save 50 percent on a $20 purchase of cupcakes from ""ChikaLicious Dessert Club."" If 450 people agree to the deal, everyone saves money. If that critical number is not reached, however, the deal is a dud. The site offers one deal per day in the cities it covers, and the number of cities in the network is growing fast. It's a good idea for sure, but it might also be an incredibly valuable one. Web rumors this week suggest Groupon may be in the process of raising a new round of venture capital at a $1.2 billion valuation. The money follows a $30 million round that valued Groupon at $250 million. In layman's terms: Investors think Groupon is set to be the Web's next breakout hit. Groupon's competitors are seeing big investment, too. Rival site LivingSocial recently raised $25 million. BuyWithMe has raised $5.5 million. How many group buying sites are there now? Possibly dozens: SocialBuy, Groop Swoop and Scoop St., to name a few. The dynamics of group buying mean that Groupon has a significant early advantage, however: The more users a site can gain, the more leverage it has to score big discounts from businesses. It's a hot market we should have seen coming. The top Web trends at the start of the year included the ""real-time Web"" and ""location."" With almost constant web connectivity provided by smartphones and free Wi-Fi at coffee shops, airports and bookstores -- not to mention the immediacy of Twitter and Facebook -- we've come to expect instant gratification online. Group buying meets that need. Groupon is local, too, targeting deals to metropolitan areas. There's a further trend Groupon capitalizes upon: Social networking brings us together to share opinions and experiences ... why not deals too? Is Groupon worth a billion dollars? Could the group buying market be worth multiple billions? Investors seem prepared to make that bet. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Texas authorities have issued an arrest warrant for the owner of a day care center, claiming four children died and three were injured in a fire last week after she left them alone with the stove on, authorities said Monday. Authorities hope to detain 22-year-old Jessica Tata on a felony charge that she caused injury to a child, according to Donna Hawkins, a spokeswoman for the Harris County District Attorney's office. Other charges could come at a later date. Tata had been licensed since March 1, 2010, with state authorities to run the residential day care center, Texas Department of Family and Protective Services spokeswoman Gwen Carter said. The facility was cited once -- and the issue was sufficiently addressed -- for not having a fire extinguisher or carbon monoxide detector before she got her permit, according to Carter. The arrest affidavit, dated Sunday, claims that Tata ""unlawfully and recklessly"" caused ""serious bodily injury"" to at least one of the victims Thursday, after she left that child and six others unsupervised in the home day care and drove off in her car. The blaze itself likely originated on an electric stove inside, which was on and had a pot on it containing oil, according to Houston Fire Department arson investigator Thomas Wood. A definitive cause for the fire will be announced once the investigation is complete. Neighbors John Chestnut and Geoffrey Deshano told investigators that they heard Tata screaming soon after she pulled into her driveway and went to the front door, the arrest affidavit said. No other adults or day care employees were at the facility, the men said. The two told reporters that Tata's car was full of groceries when she returned to the house, adding that they called 911 and tried to help get the children out as smoke seeped from the building. ""I came to the side of the house in the backyard and smashed one of the windows open, and I could see a kid having his hands out,"" Deshano told reporters. ""I tried to grab him, but the smoke got into my face and my mouth and I couldn't breathe or see anything, and so I had to pull back,"" Chestnut added that he crawled into the house in an attempt to rescue the children. ""I can't see anything, it's hot and I'm coughing and can't breathe and all I hear are kids left and right saying, 'Help me, help me!' "" he recalled.

He told HLN's Vinnie Politan that he never had problems with the day care, calling the incident ""unfortunate."" Still, for all his positive thoughts about Tata prior to this incident, Kajoh said he couldn't defend her actions last week. ""She had options to call people,"" he said of the day care owner's decision to leave the children unattended. ""Even it is one child, not several children, that was a really bad decision. And it cost four lives.""

"(CNN) -- One in six mobile phones in Britain is contaminated with fecal matter, according to research made public Friday that cited poor hygiene as the cause. ""This study provides more evidence that people still don't wash their hands properly, especially after going to the toilet,"" Dr. Val Curtis of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said in the report. In the study, researchers in 12 cities took 390 samples from mobile phones and hands, then analyzed in a laboratory what they had found. Londoners had the highest incidence of the E. coli bacteria, which are associated with fecal matter, on their hands (28%). The bacteria can result in food poisoning and, in extreme cases, can prove fatal. The study, which also included scientists from Queen Mary, University of London, found that Britons tend not to come clean about their hygiene practices. When surveyed, 95% of respondents told the researchers that they washed their hands with soap where possible, but the researchers said 92% of phones and 82% of hands had bacteria on them. And 16% of hands and 16% of phones harbored the E. coli bacteria. ""People may claim they wash their hands regularly but the science shows otherwise,"" said Dr. Ron Cutler, of Queen Mary, University of London. A person can transfer fecal bacteria by touching door handles, food and mobile phones and, from there, to other people. The study was funded by the Wellcome Trust.","1 in 6 mobile phones is contaminated with fecal matter, study finds .

"(CNN) -- Days after allegedly causing death and devastation at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, two brothers ""spontaneously"" decided to head to a new place to unleash terror -- New York City -- that city's mayor said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the Boston bombings, told investigators that he and his brother decided to bomb Times Square as they talked the night of April 18 in a Mercedes SUV they'd just carjacked, New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. The 19-year-old initially told investigators from a Boston hospital bed that he and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had talked about going to New York to ""party."" Then he offered a new account during a second round of questioning Sunday evening into Monday, during which Kelly said Dzhokhar was ""a lot more lucid"" than the first time he was interviewed. The brothers had five pipe bombs and a ""pressure-cooker bomb"" -- the latter similar to the bombs used in the Boston blasts -- with them in the SUV that they could have used in New York, Kelly said. Instead, their plan ""fell apart"" when the SUV ran low on fuel in the Boston area and the Tsarnaevs ordered the driver to pull into a gas station, Kelly said. The driver escaped during the refueling, he said, and police subsequently caught up with the Tsarnaevs -- first in a shootout after which 26-year-old Tamerlan died, then by capturing Dzhokhar on Friday. ""We don't know that we would have been able to stop the terrorists had they arrived here from Boston,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. ""We're just thankful that we didn't have to find out that answer."" Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said investigators believe the Boston bombing suspects were planning another attack ""likely in the Boston area."" ""The notion they decided to go to New York was a rushed event after this thing unraveled on them,"" the Michigan Republican said. Latest developments in the Boston bombings probe . There is no evidence that New York City is currently a target of a terror attack stemming from the Boston bombings, Kelly added. Still, he said authorities are investigating two visits that the surviving suspect made to New York City last year. In one of those trips, in April 2012, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is photographed in Times Square. Official: U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq motivated bombings . One person pictured in that picture was in federal custody Thursday, as he's been for the last six days, on alleged visa violations. This man, whom a federal law enforcement source said Dzhokhar shared a cell phone with, was originally detained last Friday with another person when federal agents swarmed a residence thinking Dzhokhar might be inside, a federal law enforcement source said. Neither of these two detained men -- both foreign exchange students from Kazakhstan at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, where Dzhokhar also was enrolled -- has been linked to the Boston Marathon attack. Yet investigators hope they can better piece together the suspected bombers' movements before and after the marathon. ""These guys are not being cut loose immediately, and there's a reason why,"" the federal law enforcement source said. Sources: Russia raised concerns about mother, son . While investigators continue to look into the Boston bombings, the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus police officer and a violent chase and shootout in Watertown, Massachusetts -- all of which authorities have blamed on the Tsarnaev brothers -- the probe has also been focused some 5,500 miles away in the semi-autonomous Russian republic of Dagestan. That's where the suspects' parents live and spoke to reporters Thursday. Their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh that she didn't want to accept the reality of the bombing, saying it was fake. She has seen a video pushing the wild idea, she said, adding that there was no blood -- and that paint was used instead. Photos: Galleries from the attack and aftermath . ""That's what I want to know, because everybody's talking about it -- that this is a show, that's what I want to know. That's what I want to understand,"" she said. But her disbelief broke down when she spoke of the victims. ""I really feel sorry for all of them. Really feel sorry for all of them,"" she said, her voice cracking even as she remained resolute that her sons were not involved. While her husband Anzor Tsarnaev has said he plans to fly to the United States -- though those plans may be in limbo after Zubeidat said she called for an ambulance for him on Thursday in Makhachkala -- his wife isn't planning to join him. She's wanted on 2012 felony charges of shoplifting and property damage in Massachusetts, according to court officials. The family lived there before she jumped bail; the parents moved the same year to Dagestan. Dead Boston bomb suspect posted video of jihadist, analysis shows . A year before, Zubeidat and her son Tamerlan were both added by U.S. authorities to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database -- a collection of more than a half million names maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an intelligence official said. That came as Russia raised concerns to U.S. authorities about her and her son, sources told CNN. Zubeidat Tsarnaev said the FBI had visited her family ""several times"" in 2011 with questions about Tamerlan's ""Islamic interests."" A senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of information from the Russians said that the case then ""was extremely thin,"" adding that Russia wanted Tamerlan Tsarnaev questioned to see if he and others had become ""radicalized."" U.S. authorities closed the case a few months after opening it. Suspects' mother describes her last conversation with her sons . Suspect's widow is assisting investigation, lawyer says . Putin: 'We were right' Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday urged closer cooperation between other countries' security services in the wake of the Boston attack . ""If we combine our efforts, we will not suffer blows like that,"" he said during a live televised call-in session in Moscow on Thursday. The Tsarnaevs are originally from the embattled Russian republic of Chechnya but fled from the brutal wars there in the 1990s. The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan and moved at different times to the United States. In his first on-camera comments since the bombing, Putin also lashed out against those in the West who have slammed Russia for human rights abuses in its actions toward Chechnya. The truth about the Chechen threat . ""Russia is among the first victims, and I hate it when our Western partners call our terrorists -- who committed some heinous crimes in Russia -- when they call them freedom fighters and never call them terrorists. They supported them,"" said Putin, accusing unnamed people or groups of providing Russia's foes with political, financial and ""media"" support. And U.S. authorities have come under fire at home, with lawmakers asking if the FBI and CIA failed to share information. Sources told CNN that Russia had separately asked the FBI and the CIA to look into Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Thursday he believes ""ultimate blame"" for the attacks goes to the Obama administration. ""The FBI and the CIA are, they have great people but, you know, we're going backwards in national security. Benghazi and Boston to me are examples of us going backward,"" he said. But a ranking Democrat on a House intelligence subcommittee said Thursday he does not see an intelligence-sharing failure. ""This information was put in a database, it was shared among different agencies, it was shared with a joint terrorism task force, and that's exactly what should happen,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, told CNN, referring to the TIDE database. Sources: Suspect was unarmed in boat . More details, meanwhile, continue to emerge about the April 15 bombings as well as authorities' engagement days later with the two suspects. A law enforcement official told CNN Thursday that at least one of the two bombs -- the second to explode -- was detonated by remote control. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Maryland Democrat and member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said that the brothers used a remote control device similar to those used to guide toy cars. While video taken near the scene of the explosions shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev talking on a cell phone, it is not known whether he used it to trigger a device, a law enforcement official said. Those twin blasts killed three people and injured more than 260 others, 14 of whom had limbs amputated. As of Thursday evening, 34 of those wounded were still being treated at Boston hospitals, including one patient in critical condition. The manhunt for those responsible ended last Friday, when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured after a tense standoff after he'd hidden in a boat in the yard of a home in the Boston suburb of Watertown, Massachusetts. The teenager was unarmed when he was wounded in a barrage of gunfire, and there was no firearm found in the boat, said several sources from difference agencies familiar with the investigation. Authorities previously said in a criminal complaint that there was a standoff involving gunfire before Dzhokhar's capture. Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Saturday that it was his understanding that the suspect fired from the boat. This came after Tsarnaev and his older brother allegedly shot and killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus police officer Sean Collier in Cambridge. The Middlesex County District Attorney's Office hopes to bring charges against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for his alleged role in incidents last week in Cambridge and Watertown, spokeswoman Stephanie Guyotte said Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities are still unraveling the horrors allegedly committed on nearly 500 children sheltered at ""La Gran Familia"" refuge in the western state of Michoacan. At The Big Family shelter, scores of children -- some as young as two months old -- were denied visits from their parents, virtually imprisoned in vermin-infested quarters and routinely subjected to physical, psychological and sexual abuse, authorities said. Authorities raided the sprawling, squalid shelter in the city of Zamora Tuesday after a number of parents complained about being denied access to their children, Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karan told reporters. ""We found close to 500 children in truly deplorable conditions,"" Murillo said. Victims told investigators that children were routinely forced to beg for money on the streets, eat unsanitary food and sleep on hard floors crawling with rats and roaches, Murillo said. It was not clear from Mexican authorities how so many children -- along with some adults -- came to be at the shelter. The operator of the shelter, Rosa del Carmen Verduzco, was detained along with eight of her employees, authorities said. They were being questioned in connection with abuse and other charges. ""This is truly upsetting,"" Michoacan governor Salvador Jara Guerrero told reporters. ""We did not expect to find such conditions... We must not allow these things to occur -- not in Michoacan, not in the republic."" Tomas Zeron de Lucio, chief investigator with the attorney general's office, said babies born at the shelter were allegedly registered under Verduzco's name. The biological parents were told that the babies would be allowed to leave when they came of age. One victim told investigators that she asked Verduzco permission to leave the home when she turned 18 but was kept there as a worker for an additional 13 years, Zeron de Lucio said. The victim said she gave birth to two daughters while living at the shelter and both were registered under another name, Zeron de Lucio said. She was allowed to see the girls for three hours every two months. During her last meeting with Verduzco, the victim told investigators, she offered the shelter operator about 10,000 Mexican pesos -- or about $750 -- to get her daughters back. ""Get the money together,"" Verduzco reportedly told her, ""and give me a call."" Authorities were working to rid the shelter of rats, bedbugs and roaches because there was no other place to immediately move the scores of children on short notice. ""Right now, we're undertaking an exhaustive cleaning because there were bedbugs, roaches and rats even in the food,"" Maria Ampudio, who works with a charitable organization, told CNN Wednesday. ""The food given to the children was spoiled and outdated."" Ampudio said some girls reported being thrown to the ground and kicked in the head. The shelter, which houses people ranging from newborns to 40 years of age, had been in operation for more than 40 years, authorities said. The majority of the minors are between 3 and 17 years of age -- 278 are male and 174 female. There were 138 adults from 18 to 40 years of age also at the schedule. Also recovered were six babies and toddlers. The website of ""La Gran Familia"" shelter said Verduzco started caring for abandoned children when she herself was a teenager. She later worked as a grade school teacher and earned a meager living to care for her charges. The children, the website said, helped raise money by selling newspapers and sweets in the town square. Verduzco later left her charges in the care of a poor, elderly woman, according to the website. She moved to Mexico City to work with a charitable foundation, where she cared for 33 children and sent money back to Zamora. She later returned to Michoacan to start La Gran Familia, which housed more than 4,000 children over the years, according to the website. CNN's Fidel Gutierrez contributed to this report.","Mexican authorities found nearly 500 children living in squalor at a refuge in Michoacan state .

"Bayonne, New Jersey (CNN) -- If you don't know Chuck Wepner's claim to fame, you will in a hurry after you enter his small apartment in this gritty North Jersey city on the Hudson River. Maybe you'll see the framed poster of the most famous boxer of all time in his office, the one autographed, ""To Chuck and Linda: Good luck to my dear friends, from Muhammad Ali. After me, there will be no other. P.S. Stay off my foot!"" (We'll explain that in a minute). Or maybe he'll hand you a business card for his job as a liquor salesman. Flip it over, and you'll find a photo of a young Wepner, boxing trunks pulled over his navel, standing over a fallen Ali in the ring. Or maybe he'll sit down in his recliner and tell you one of his favorite stories, like the night he came back to his hotel room after he survived 15 rounds with Ali in a stunning 1975 fight. ""The day before the (Ali) fight, I took my wife out shopping and bought her a powder-blue negligée, because I told her, 'You need to look right when you sleep with the heavyweight champion of the world,'"" he said. ""The night I lost, my (ex-)wife is sitting on the edge of the bed in the negligée and she asks, 'So, am I going to Ali's room or what?'"" But you don't have to meet Wepner to know why he's famous -- and why he's about to become even more well-known in the coming months. You've seen the movies, all six of them, in the theaters or a few dozen times on cable TV. Sylvester Stallone played Rocky in the famous film series. Wepner is Rocky, the man who went almost the full 15 rounds (the fight was stopped in the 15th) with Ali in 1975 to inspire the Oscar-winning movie. But his real-life story is actually more fascinating, more layered and compelling, than the one that has raked in more than $1 billion. That's why ESPN is making a documentary about his life, and why Hollywood is making another movie about the man who inspired Rocky. But Wepner is clear on one point. ""This is not another Rocky movie,"" he said recently. ""It's a movie about the real Rocky."" The changing face of women's boxing . The real Rocky is one of boxing's true characters, a burly former Marine nicknamed the Bayonne Bleeder who went from fighting in smoky New Jersey clubs to knocking down (but not out) the mighty Ali. He's also a man who spent three years in prison for cocaine possession but rebounded to find the love of his life. He has a story about the night he asked Linda, his wife, on a date. ""I used to drink vodka all the time, but I remember that the beer cooler was on the other side of the bar and you had to bend over to get into it,"" he said. ""So she bent over and got one and I said, 'You wanna go out!' I picked her up after work that day. That's a true story."" They're all true stories. Or, at least mostly true. Again, with 72-year-old Wepner, it's always best to let him explain. ""There's one scene in (the movie), I'm in a hotel room with a couple of my go-go girls,"" he said. ""I'm pouring champagne all over their bodies and drinking the champagne. ""I said (to the writer), 'You got me laying in the bed with three go-go girls pouring champagne over them. It was only two!' And he said, 'Chuck, three, four, five girls, people will believe anything about you!'"" Liev Schreiber is set to portray him in ""The Bleeder,"" which is scheduled to hit theaters in 2012, while Christina Hendricks will play Linda and Naomi Watts will play his first wife. The project has been in the works for more than seven years, and Wepner is convinced it can shock the world the way Stallone's fictional version did 35 years ago. But first, sports fans will revisit Wepner's career with an hourlong ESPN documentary, set to air on October 25, called ""The Real Rocky."" Mike Tollin, who has produced sports movies like ""Coach Carter"" and documentaries like ""The Bronx is Burning,"" is producing both projects. ""With Chuck Wepner,"" Tollin said in a phone interview, ""you have a guy who outside of certain parts of New Jersey can be treated almost like a fictional character, but you have this fascinating chapter of boxing lore and all these real-life characters to draw from."" None of this would have happened if Wepner's mother didn't interrupt him during an episode of ""Kojak"" in 1975 and tell him to pick up that day's newspaper. Promoter Don King had chosen Wepner to fight Ali, but no one had bothered to tell him. Q&A: USA Boxing Coach Gloria Peek . It was supposed to be an easy fight for Ali, who had just stunned George Foreman in Zaire to regain the heavyweight championship.  Ali was 45-2, at the peak of his fame. Wepner? He was no slouch, but not in the same league. Larry Merchant, the longtime boxing writer for The New York Post, called it ""a fight between a house painter and an artist."" But Wepner spent seven weeks ""laying off the booze and women,"" he said, training for his moment. And it lasted more than a moment. On March 24, 1975, Wepner went 15 rounds with Ali, briefly knocking him to the canvas in the ninth round. (Wepner insists he hit the champ with a shot just below his heart; Ali has long contended that his opponent stepped on his foot.) Watch Wepner knock down Ali . The fight made him famous, but the movies changed his life. Stallone was watching in Los Angeles, and two years later, Wepner was sitting in a Manhattan theater thinking, ""I hope this movie's decent."" ""It was amazing!"" Wepner said. ""I had no idea. It was amazing. After the knockdown of Apollo, the crowd started jeering him and started cheering for me. People are coming up to me and hugging me, 'CHUCK! Great movie!'"" But the movie is only one twist in Wepner's life. He retired from boxing and wrestled ""Andre the Giant"" at Shea Stadium, the massive pro wrestler spun him in the air before tossing him out of the ring. He also partied. A lot. Watch Wepner fight ""Andre the Giant"" ""You know what it was? The late '70s and early '80s, it was all parties,"" Wepner said. ""Everywhere you went there was cocaine. I've got to be honest with you, it was a great, great time in my life, other than getting in trouble. I managed to get through that and everything is great now. It was one party after another. I used to be out from Thursday to Sunday. It was so much fun. You might say the good times were very addictive."" The trouble: Wepner was arrested in 1985 for cocaine possession. He spent nearly three years in prison, but he re-emerged clean and, with Linda, happy. Plus, in 2006 scored his biggest victory outside the ring: He settled a lawsuit with Stallone for using him as his inspiration for the Rocky series. (Details of the settlement have not been revealed.) Now, he'll have a documentary and a movie on his life and career, which is more fascinating than anything a screenwriter could dream up. But for the real Rocky, this is no case of sudden fame. ""Somebody said to me, 'Wow, you're finally getting some recognition.'"" Wepner said. ""For 36 years, I've been the champ.""","Former heavyweight boxer Chuck Wepner fought Muhammad Ali in 1975 .

"(CNN) -- What's the best source of information for anyone planning a move overseas -- the Internet, the bookstore or those carefully worded government travel warnings? Duh! It's the movies, of course. Why would anyone do any research when everything they need to know about their new lives has been laid bare on the silver screen? When cinema gets it right, it does a pretty good job of taking a hatchet to the expat dream of lounging around in exotic bars dressed in linen suits and Panama hats. Just as often, however, Hollywood's overseas adventures run into so much trouble it's a wonder it isn't now languishing in the bowels of a dank foreign prison hoping that someone at the embassy might be able to put in a few calls. To help navigate the celluloid jungle, here's our purely subjective list of the best and worst expat movies. Best . 5. 'The Wages of Fear' (1953) This brutal piece of black and white French cinema reeks of unwashed vests, but its depiction of nasty expat truck drivers worthlessly risking their grubby lives in the South American jungle is as explosive as the deadly nitroglycerine cargoes they're paid to deliver. Everyone is detestable, everyone dies and not even the dogs care. That's how expat life should be. Enlightening expat dialog . Dick: ""When I was a kid, I used to see men go off on these kinds of jobs ... and not come back."" 4. 'Straw Dogs' (1971) ""Wild Bunch"" director Sam Peckinpah takes a double-barrel shotgun to all those smug, honey-hued films about rural expat life in this tale about repressed American mathematician David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) relocating to his wife's Cornish village. There are no hilarious misunderstandings with local plumbers, just thugs on tricycles. There's no sun-kissed romance, just a marriage disintegrating into domestic violence. And there are no life-affirming friendships, just a cat getting throttled. The film's brutality is a bit hard to stomach. The apparent need for a 2011 remake starring Kate Bosworth was also somewhat hard to stomach. Enlightening expat dialog . Henry Niles: ""I don't know my way home."" David Sumner: ""That's OK. I don't either."" 3. 'The Third Man' (1949) Expats don't come colder than Orson Welles' elusive Harry Lime, whose classic cuckoo clock speech justifying his racketeering in bombed-to-bits Vienna sounds suspiciously like the kind of cruel logic deployed by corporate stooges when plundering developing world countries in return for a fat salary. (""Free of income tax, old man."") If only real life saw these amoral exploiters hounded down, like Lime, in a subterranean sewer. If only real life was soundtracked by zithers. Enlightening expat dialog . Harry Lime: ""Nobody thinks in terms of human beings. Governments don't. Why should we?"" 2. 'The Year of Living Dangerously' (1982) With its eclectic if somewhat dated soundtrack and expansive mysticism of Linda Hunt's diminutive paparazzo, ""Dangerously"" emerges as an anti-expat classic, contrasting the seedy and sequestered lives of foreign hacks and diplomats in Sukarno-era Indonesia against the poverty and chaos of a country on the brink. All that plus a pre-rant Mel Gibson. Enlightening expat dialog . Billy Kwan: ""Jillian is like a wavering flame that needs care to burn high. Without such care she could lapse into the promiscuity and bitterness of the failed romantic."" 1. 'Casablanca' (1942) The closing scenes may not have the tear-jerking impact they once did, but if there's a film in existence responsible for dampening as much Kleenex as ""Casablanca,"" it's probably porn. This film portrays expat life as it should be: outwitting mendacious cops and ruthless Nazis in the smoky haze of a North African piano bar while risking everything in the name of unrequitable love. Not playing golf for pity's sake. Who hasn't imagined themselves plunged into Casablanca's wartime plot of double-dealing and heartbreak? Perhaps as Humphrey Bogart, at his craggy best as jaded saloon owner Rick; Ingrid Bergman's impossibly lovely Isla Lund; or even Claude Rains' complicated French police chief Captain Renault. Sure the dialog has been quoted to death, and if Sam or anyone else plays ""As Time Goes By"" again, they're going to get the piano lid slammed on their fingers, but every fresh screening of Casablanca is still like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Oh dear. We said it. Enlightening expat dialog . Ilsa (on the verge of tears): ""I didn't count the days."" Rick: ""Well, I did. Every one of 'em. Mostly I remember the last one. The wild finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look in his face because his insides have been kicked out."" Worst expat movies . 5. 'The Beach' (2000) With its gorgeous Thai scenery and rumbling undercurrents of violence, jealousy and death, ""The Beach"" aims to deliver a serious message about the illusory nature of paradise, but doesn't. It's hard to say which is less credible, a bunch of backpacking muppets building a community on a hidden beach without an Internet cafe or Leonardo DiCaprio (as Richard) joining them and failing to get the French girl. Excruciating expat dialog . Richard: ""I just feel like everyone tries to do something different, but you always wind up doing the same damn thing."" 4. 'Under the Tuscan Sun' (2003) Unlucky-in-love American writer Diane Lane (as Frances) happens upon the only villa in Tuscany that isn't being rented out by middle class vacationers from London and buys it on a whim. In restoring the villa, she restores her own ... blah, blah, blah, whatever. So what's the message here? Don't worry if your marriage collapses, just buy a house in Italy, spend a bundle renovating it, then someone else will come along. There's a life lesson we can all relate to. Excruciating expat dialog . Frances: ""I'll hire the muscular descendants of Roman gods to do the heavy lifting."" 3. 'Eat Pray Love' (2010) Unlucky-in-love American writer Julia Roberts ... no, stick with us, this one's slightly different. Granted, Roberts as Liz Gilbert goes to Italy, but there's no villa, just the start of a year swanning around the world with no apparent worries about cash. In Italy, Roberts' character learns to eat Italian food (without gaining weight). She then moves to India to explore spirituality before traveling to Bali for love. Not love with some vacationing sleazeball. Love with Javier Bardem. Like that happens in real life. Excruciating expat dialog . Liz: ""It won't last forever. Nothing does."" (Except this film -- 140 minutes long!) 2. 'Mr. Baseball' (1992) Who needs jokes in your script when you've got foreigners? Simply send grumpy aging baseball star Jack Elliott (Tom Selleck) to Japan, where hilarity ensues as he grapples with their crazy cultural traditions -- and toilets! What should be a feelgood film about a fading star's last dash for glory winds up being a feel-queasy trot through every Japanese cliche known to Hollywood. Unsurprisingly, Universal Studios' new Japanese owners were unhappy at the time. The film does have some good performances, but not from Selleck, who was upstaged by his mustache, and not for the last time. Excruciating expat dialog . Jack: ""Different language, same attitude! Let's go!"" 1. 'Farewell to the King' (1989) Expats, eh? Always acting so damn entitled. But if you think they're annoying where you live, spare a thought for the tribe in Borneo, which winds up with Learoyd (Nick Nolte) in the midst of World War II. Not content to loudly drink his own body weight in alcohol every Friday like normal, decent expats, Nolte becomes their king -- a role that involves going topless and sporting Dog the Bounty Hunter's blond bouffant. Nolte cranks the ham dial up to 11 in this poor man's ""Apocalypse Now,"" taking on Japanese invaders to protect his tribe which, despite being peopled with fearless headhunters, would apparently have been lost without a middle aged white guy there to save the day. Excruciating expat dialogue . Learoyd: ""I have a special relationship with the spirits. I died once. I had to. I had to give up everything, even the will to live.""

"(CNN) -- Two American Airlines flights flew back to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport early Monday because of unrelated technical issues. The passenger jets landed within two minutes of each other. Flight 1359 made an emergency landing at 12:21 a.m. CT after the pilot was alerted to a mechanical issue, airline spokeswoman Laura Masvidal said. The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 plane had left for Fresno, California, with 140 passengers and five crew members an hour earlier. Masvidal did not say what the mechanical issue was. The second flight, AAL 997, was over the Gulf of Mexico on its way to Buenos Aires, Argentina, when a problem with pressurization turned up. The Boeing 777-200, carrying 223 passengers and 14 crew members, turned back to have the issue checked out but did not have to make an emergency landing, Masvidal said. It arrived at 12:23 a.m. Both planes landed safely, and the flights were rescheduled for later times.","Both are American Airlines flights .

"(CNN) -- A spacecraft that launched early Sunday is transporting a 3-D printer that could change life on the International Space Station. The SpaceX Dragon lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 1:52 a.m. ET. It will arrive on Tuesday, bringing other cargo as well, including 20 mice and elements for 255 scientific experiments aboard the ISS. ""There's nothing like a good launch, it's just fantastic,"" said Hans Koenigsman, vice president of Mission Assurance for SpaceX. ""From what I can tell, everything went perfectly."" It marks the first time a 3-D printer will be used in space, testing the ability to produce parts cheaply and on demand instead of waiting for them to arrive on a cargo ship. This technology would save time and money in future deep space missions. Also coming along is a device called ISS-RapidScat that will measure the winds on the Earth's oceans. ""This launch kicks off a very busy time for the space station,"" said NASA's Sam Scimemi, director of the ISS. On September 25, three new crew members for the ISS will arrive aboard a Soyuz spacecraft. Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore of NASA and Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova of the Russian Federal Space Agency will launch from Kazakhstan and are expected to arrive six hours later. This is the Dragon's fourth cargo flight to the Space Station, including the test flight on May 2012. In addition to bringing supplies, it is the only spacecraft that can bring back cargo experiment samples. NASA recently announced it was awarding $6.8 billion contracts to Space X and Boeing to shuttle cargo and astronauts to and from the ISS. Since NASA's space shuttle program was retired in 2011, astronauts have been hitching rides on the Soyuz spacecraft, at a cost of $70 million per seat. Both Boeing and SpaceX's crafts will go through a certification process first. The target date to begin manned missions is 2017. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","The SpaceX Dragon is bringing a 3-D printer and other supplies .

"(CNN) -- ""The Big Bang Theory"" is back in action. The top-rated comedy returns to CBS on Monday with its eighth season premiere after contract talks briefly held up production in late July. 'Big Bang Theory' contract talks stall production . But since the contracts have been hammered out -- with some of the leading cast members now earning a reported $1 million per episode -- ""The Big Bang Theory"" is moving forward with what sounds like a season full of changes. Let's hope Sheldon can cope this time around. Here's what we've heard fans should expect for season 8 of ""The Big Bang Theory"": . Sheldon's return . At the end of season 7, Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) announced that he couldn't handle all of the new developments happening in his life, and was ""getting on a train and leaving forever."" His plan to ""live off the land"" didn't go so well, as he makes his return in season 8's hour-long premiere after getting robbed on the train. As a sneak peek shows, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Amy (Mayim Bialik) have to head down to Arizona to collect Sheldon and bring him back home. Don't expect a wedding for Leonard and Penny . Penny (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) and Leonard may have ended the seventh season with an engagement, but executive producer Steve Molaro told TV Guide they're not rushing the couple to the altar. They're going to take it so slowly that Molaro is ""99%"" sure that a wedding won't happen in season 8. ""We're not anti-wedding. It's just they're feeling this out,"" the EP said. ""Stuff with money and things like that can come up with them being engaged without us having to rush to the altar and change the fabric of the show."" Besides, Molaro added, he's just not ready to see Leonard and Sheldon cease being roommates. Sheldon and Penny get new jobs . Not to mention that Penny has a big career shift in front of her: The waitress/actress is leaving the drama behind for a new job as a pharmaceutical sales rep at Bernadette's (Melissa Rauch) company. You'll see her interview with her new, much shorter haircut during tonight's two-part premiere. The new gig has the potential to rock the boat in Penny's new engagement. ""It alters their dynamic because now she's actually doing well financially,"" Molaro told TVLine. ""It's a new chapter for her."" Along with Penny, Sheldon's also carving a new path at work. He'll get to study dark matter as long as he takes a job as a junior professor. Yet it looks like no one's interested in taking Sheldon's course -- except for Howard, that is. Howard has mother issues . Perhaps Howard (Simon Helberg) just really needs the distraction, since he's butting heads with his mother's caretaker, Stuart. ""He's playing too many roles for my character to feel comfortable with,"" Simon Helberg, who plays Howard, says of the new season. ""It's a bit of a threat to Howard that he's being replaced as a son."" Sheldon and Amy are taking it slow . Amy was not pleased that Leonard and Penny let Sheldon go off on his soul-searching journey, and the couple's reunion isn't exactly romantic. It's Leonard that Sheldon calls when he gets into trouble, and when Amy shows up with Leonard at the police station, a surprised Sheldon asks, ""Why did you come?"" But the couple's come too far for Sheldon's social fumbles to get in their way. ""We're always moving them forward in baby steps,"" producer Molaro told TVLine. "" ""They're on the same trajectory that they've been on since they met, and that is she is continuing to drag him along into this relationship, whether he wants to admit that he likes it or or not. He's come a long way."" Emily and Raj are going strong . Season 7 ended with each main character finding love, and that included Raj (Kunal Nayyar), who's now dating Laura Spencer's Emily. The couple is still together as season 8 begins, and Molaro promises that we'll learn more about Emily as the season progresses.

"Washington (CNN) -- A 5-year-old's birthday party with no cake and candles? Unheard of, except in politics. Monday marked the fifth anniversary of President Barack Obama's signing of the 2009 stimulus bill, the focus of a hyper-partisan debate over the first major legislation of his presidency. By most assessments, the $800-billion-plus spending and tax-relief program helped reverse job losses and restore economic growth, though not as fast or strong as originally predicted. Arguments based on political ideology persist over whether it helped or hurt the county in the long run. Obama and Democrats argue it was crucial to the recovery from what is now called the Great Recession, while Republicans who opposed the stimulus then still call it the wrong prescription. CNNMoney: States' unemployment rates . White House relatively silent on anniversary: For Monday's milestone, the White House took the somewhat muted approach of releasing a blog post by Jason Furman, the chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, who touted a new report on the benefits from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ""The economy has now grown for 11 straight quarters, and businesses have added 8.5 million jobs since early 2010,"" Furman's blog post said. ""While far more work remains to ensure that the economy provides opportunity for every American, there can be no question that President Obama's actions to date have laid the groundwork for stronger, more sustainable economic growth in the years ahead."" Vice President Joe Biden will mark the anniversary on Wednesday in Illinois, but otherwise, Furman's post and the final report on the stimulus by the council he heads accounted for the total administration commemoration on the Presidents Day holiday. No silence from the right: Republicans, meanwhile, kept up their consistent drumbeat of criticism. The Republican National Committee sent reporters a morning email headlined: ""The Stimulus That Wasn't: Five Years Later, It's Clear Obama's Stimulus Was A Waste Of Taxpayer Dollars."" ""If you recall five years ago, the notion was that if the government spent all this money -- that, by the way, was borrowed -- that somehow the economy would begin to grow and create jobs,"" GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said in a video. ""Well, of course, it clearly failed."" The differing reactions continue a pattern that pre-dates congressional approval of the stimulus law in 2009 with almost zero Republican support. CNNMoney: Where's the debt ceiling now? Republicans 'set terms' for economic debates: To Peter Hamby, CNN Digital's national political reporter, the Obama administration has been weak in communicating economic accomplishments compared to Republicans, who he said ""really set the terms ... for these economic debates."" That was obvious on Monday. Along with the RNC and Rubio attacks, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and two other Senate GOP leaders -- John Cornyn of Texas and John Thune of South Dakota -- also launched broadsides. The Republican criticism is part of GOP strategy to frame this year's congressional elections as a referendum on Obama's presidency, with the party's conservative base relentlessly hammering Democrats over still-sluggish economic growth and the Obamacare health reforms. A Pew Research poll from 2012 showed Americans divided and uncertain on the stimulus issue, with 37% supporting it, 41% registering disapproval and nearly a quarter of respondents unsure. As usual, a wide partisan divide existed, with two-thirds of Democrats in support compared to only 12% of Republicans. CNNMoney: 3 problems Congress should stop asking the Fed to solve . White House says legislative goals reached: The White House report on the stimulus released Monday said the legislation along with subsequent legislation intended to boost job growth achieved their goal. ""Considerable evidence suggests the federal government's efforts to jump-start the economy were successful,"" it concluded, adding that the stimulus bill ""provided an important and timely boost to GDP in 2009 and 2010."" Obama calls for continued government investment in job creation, such as funding infrastructure projects to rebuild roads and bridges, as well as jobs training programs. Republicans say stimulus proves their point: Republicans say the legacy of the stimulus bill showed a big government approach doesn't work. ""Five years later, underemployment is still too high, the number of people that have dropped out of the workforce is astounding, unemployment remains stubbornly high and our economy isn't growing fast enough â€” proof that massive government spending, particularly debt spending, is not the solution to our economic growth problems,"" Rubio's video said. In response to the fresh GOP attacks, the left-leaning ThinkProgress.org website noted that Republicans who opposed the stimulus bill in 2009 were happy to receive its benefits in ensuing years, with some claiming credit for projects funded with stimulus money they had opposed. Government intervention in response to the recession began in the final months of the Bush administration that preceded Obama, with bailouts of the financial system and auto industry. Obama continued and built on that strategy with the stimulus bill and expanded auto bailout. The stimulus plan included almost $300 billion in tax relief as well as spending on various programs and initiatives including education, medical research, health care, infrastructure, local law enforcement, energy and job training. CNN's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","White House report says stimulus bill achieved its goal of reversing downturn .

"Canadensis, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The self-taught survivalist accused of killing one Pennsylvania state trooper and wounding another planned the ambush for months, police said. Authorities continue their search for suspect Eric Matthew Frein on Sunday but were yet to have cornered him in a wooded area around the Pike and Monroe county border. ""Based on our investigations, we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years,"" State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Sunday. He planned his attack and retreat. However, we believe we are closing in on him."" The suspect has had the advantage of knowing the terrain where he is hidden, but police say his head start is fleeting. ""Our tactical operations people now also know his backyard, the area he once felt safe in,"" Bivens said. ""We are pushing him hard, he is no longer safe there and I am confident he will be apprehended."" Frein is being sought in the death of Cpl. Byron Dickson in a September 12 ambush outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove. He is also suspected of wounding another officer. He is still considered armed and dangerous, and police have found several items that Frein had either abandoned or hidden, he said. An assault rifle and ammunition are among the weapons recovered, Bivens said. There have been several possible sightings of the suspect, but Bivens declined to label any as a confirmed sighting. While a shelter-in-place order for residents near the primary search area has been lifted, people should stay out of the woods where law enforcement officers are looking for the self-taught survivalist, police said. Frein is on the run and possibly armed, but there is no indication that he is a danger to anyone other than law enforcement, Bivens said. If he wanted to harm civilians, he's had the opportunity to do so, he said. ""While we can never completely rule out an act of violence, I am convinced that Frein has engaged in a personal battle with law enforcement, specifically the Pennsylvania State Police, and will likely stay focused on that fight,"" he said. Police on Friday had surrounded an area where Frein was believed to be hiding, the chairman of Barrett Township board of supervisors, Ralph Megliola, said. He added that he was unaware if there had been any credible sightings of Frein since then. The area is not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, in the Poconos. There were gunshots in the area, but Bevins said they were not related to the search, and that officers and the suspect have not exchanged gunfire. As many as 400 law enforcement officers were involved in the search, including members of the U.S. Marshals Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI. Canadensis is about 20 miles from the site where Dickson was shot. The FBI has placed Frein on its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list and is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Frein is a survivalist with an extensive shooting background and a grudge against law enforcement, officials have said. Frein apparently cut his hair into a mohawk style before the attack on police and was active in a military simulation unit that re-enacted Cold War-era European conflicts, officials said. His FBI most-wanted poster describes him as a ""heavy smoker, a weapons enthusiast, and a survivalist. He claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa, and he has studied Russian and Serbian languages."" State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said Wednesday that investigators know Frein ""has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder."" ""He has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society."" Trooper shooting suspect might try to target more officers, police say . CNN's Chris Welch and Sonia Moghe reported from northeast Pennsylvania while Mariano Castillo reported and wrote from New York. CNN's Steve Almasy, Ralph Ellis and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","NEW: Police believe ambush was planned for months .

"(CNN) -- An al Qaeda-produced video posted on a website in early July opens with uplifting images of smiling Syrian children and jovial old men listening to speeches delivered by al Qaeda militants. The video seems startlingly out of place on a website usually devoted to serious young men learning to fire machine guns, bloodshed and graphic images of civilian casualties purportedly caused by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, the video, featured on a site aligned with al Qaeda, shows a Jordanian member of al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria insisting that his group's poor image is just a myth propagated by Western media. He says: ""The international channels try to twist the picture and portray the mujahedeen as bloodthirsty, as distanced from the people -- that they reject the people and don't love them."" As the Jordanian militant speaks, young Syrian boys crowd around him. Al Qaeda-affiliated fighters have set up ""Advocacy Tents"" in Syria's largest city, Aleppo, where the jihadists can ""educate the people on our point of view."" In another apparent attempt to soften its image, al Qaeda members in Syria held something akin to a town fair. Another al Qaeda video produced in Syria surfaced online in July, this one showing an al Qaeda-organized ice cream-eating contest in Aleppo. Around the same time, an Arabic-language news outlet, Aleppo News, published a video of a tug-of-war between members of the two al Qaeda-affiliated rebel groups fighting in Syria. In the video, crowds of young boys and older men cheer on the members of al Qaeda. Al Qaeda and its regional franchises understand they need to try to win the ""heart and minds"" of the local population; something they have generally failed to do in the past and something that the leaders of these groups have come to understand is a major problem. In documents recovered in Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, bin Laden and his top advisers privately criticized the brutal tactics of al Qaeda in Iraq, which had provoked a tribal uprising known as ""the Sunni Awakening"" that almost destroyed al Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate in 2006 and 2007. Now, al Qaeda in Iraq and in neighboring Syria are experiencing a revival, a revival at least somewhat fueled by al Qaeda learning from some of the mistakes it made during the previous decade in Iraq. This is significant because al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, al Nusra, is widely considered to be the most effective rebel force fighting the Assad regime, and the group pledged allegiance to the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in April. But videos of al Qaeda militants playing tug-of-war or joking with members of the local community are hardly signs of moderation. Al Qaeda's Syrian branch releases lengthy and passionate sermons dedicated to denouncing Shi'a Muslims as apostates who should be killed. And although some al Qaeda fighters in Syria might be engaging the public with ice cream, games and conversation, their colleagues in neighboring Iraq continue to launch bloody attacks on civilians. On Monday, at least 50 people were killed in 15 separate car bomb attacks in Baghdad. Many of those bombings are believed be the work of al Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate. In all likelihood, al Qaeda and its allied groups are doing too little, too late, in their quest to win the public's hearts and minds. The group's senior leaders recognized the dangers of killing too many Muslim civilians as far back as 2005, when Zawahiri reprimanded the founder of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, for alienating the Iraqi people with indiscriminate violence. And the majority of Muslims around the world reject violence in the name of Islam, particularly in the form of suicide bombings. This is unsurprising, given that al Qaeda's violence has primarily claimed Muslim lives. It will take a lot more than ice cream socials to undo that damage.","Writers: Al Qaeda posting feel-good videos, holding ice cream eating contests, tugs of war .

"(CNN) -- Former British pop star Gary Glitter was arrested Thursday and charged with committing eight sex offenses against two teenage girls more than three decades ago. Glitter, 70, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was known as a ""glam rocker"" in the 1970s for his flamboyant clothes and performing style. He sold 18 million records with hits like ""I'm the Leader of the Gang,"" ""I Love You Love Me Love"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll."" He was charged with six counts of indecent assault, one count of administering a drug to facilitate sexual intercourse and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under age 13, the Crown Prosecution Office said. The offenses happened between 1977 and 1980 when the girls were 12 to 14 years old, the Crown Prosecution Office said. There was not sufficient evidence to prosecute five allegations made by two other complainants, authorities said. Glitter is scheduled to appear June 19 in court. Glitter has been prosecuted previously on sex charges. In 1999 he admitted possessing child pornography and was jailed for four months. While living in Vietnam he was convicted of sex offenses against young girls and jailed nearly three years before being deported to England. Another British pop culture figure was accused of sex crimes in recent years. In 2012, women came forward to allege television disc jockey and television star Jimmy Savile had sexually molested them decades earlier when they were in their mid-teens. Savile died in 2011 at age 84. CNN's Lorenza Brascia contributed to this report.","Gary Glitter, 70, accused of eight sex crimes from 1977-80 .

"Irbil, Iraqi Kurdistan (CNN) -- They are the faces of an entire community on the run. Singled out, threatened, chased at gunpoint from their homes. Pursued purely because they are members of an ethnic and religious minority. Iraq's Yazidi Kurds are no strangers to persecution. Their faith teaches them that throughout history, they have been subjected to 72 genocides. Many world leaders fear they are on the brink of a 73rd massacre, this time at the hands of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State. Kurdish photographer Warzer Jaff spent a week documenting the exodus of the Yazidis from their ancient homeland. What is immediately striking in his portraits are their piercing eyes. ""I am fascinated with the deep sadness in their eyes,"" Jaff says. ""You don't see one single happy face."" There is little room for joy when one has been made instantly homeless. In the weeks since ISIS militants overran cities and towns in northern Iraq, the Yazidis joined a modern-day exodus of hundreds of thousands of other Iraqis. Most of those fleeing come from the many other ethnic and religious minorities that make up the mosaic of the region, including Chaldeans, Assyrians, Turcomen, Shi'ites, Shabbak, Kurds. Instantly made homeless, tens of thousands of these families have sought shelter in Iraqi Kurdistan. Driving through this region, one can see families squatting under bridges, camping in derelict buildings, unfinished construction sites, churches, youth centers, open fields. Each refugee shares horrifying stories of abduction and murder. Even more disturbing, the frequent refrain that ""our neighbors did this to us."" Their claims that Arab tribesmen joined in the looting and kidnapping of these defenseless minorities suggests there is little hope these communities will one day live side by side together again in peace. As one senior Kurdish official put it, ""the social fabric has been torn."" ""I don't want to live with Arabs anymore, they take our land, they kidnap our women, and they kill us, why should I live with them?"" asked Ali Khalid, 75, a Yazidi. He wandered amid the tents of a brand new refugee camp leaning on a cane; his long white mustache, a proud symbol for Yazidi men, drooping over his mouth. Like nearly every other displaced Iraqi we met over the last week, Khalid urged Western governments to grant his people asylum in Europe or North America. Not far away, a grieving mother showed a laminated identity card. It belonged to her 20-year old daughter, Baran. She was fatally wounded by shrapnel two weeks ago, Khokhe Namir said, while racing out into the backyard to pull a child back to safety. ""I buried her with my own hands,"" Namir said, scraping at the dirt with her fingers, as tears streamed down her cheeks. Amid the grief and despair, there are still moments of childlike innocence. In a refugee camp for Iraqis that sprouted up in a Kurdish-controlled enclave in Syria, a red-haired girl picked through a pile of second-hand clothes donated by local Kurds. ""I like the bright colors and the flowers,"" she said, after eyeing a long dress decorated with pink flowers. Last Friday, Jaff wandered up from a tent in a refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan visibly shaken. ""There's a newborn baby who was born on the mountain, I'm afraid she's going to die,"" he said. In the tent, the parents of the 6-day-old girl had bound their infant in a sheet and laid her on the dirt, atop a pile of blankets and cushions. They didn't have a cradle for the child. The girl was born on Sinjar Mountain. Tens of thousands of Yazidis sought refuge on its heights as they fled ISIS fighters, only to find themselves trapped and surrounded by the militants. Jaff took the little girl's parents into town and bought them a cradle and extra food for their baby. Across the Kurdish regions of Iraq and Syria, there have been many similar acts of kindness and generosity from locals toward their less fortunate cousins from farther south. The baby's parents told me despite the heat, she was eating normally. The girl appeared healthy. Her mother said she was thinking of naming her child Hajar. Loosely translated, that means migrant or as the family interpreted it, ""Exile.""
