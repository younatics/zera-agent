"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranians marked a holiday that leads up to the Persian new year under the watchful eyes of police Tuesday night after the Islamic republic's supreme leader tried to discourage the celebrations. Thousands of people turned out, some in groups as large as 400 people, to dance, listen to music and light bonfires in side streets around Tehran on the festival of Chaharshanbe Soori. But unlike other holidays in recent months, there was no immediate sign that the observance was becoming a platform for protests against the country's leadership. Parties continued into early Wednesday, including one in the northern neighborhood of Zafaranieh where about 150 people danced to music pouring out of cars in the neighborhood. Some revelers played cat-and-mouse games with police who roamed the streets, looking to break up ongoing celebrations. Watch YouTube video of men dancing around a fire . Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme leader, had urged Iranians to ignore Chaharshanbe Soori, an ancient festival held on the eve of the last Wednesday before spring. It dates back thousands of years and leads up to Norooz, the holiday that begins with the first day of spring and the Persian new year, which falls on Saturday this year.

In a statement published by Iranian news sites, Khamenei said the festivities have no basis in Islam, and can cause ""harm and corruption."" ""It is appropriate to avoid it,"" he said. Watch YouTube video of revelers in Tehran shouting ""death to the dictator"" Iran has been wracked by anti-government demonstrations since the disputed June 12 presidential vote that resulted in the re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The government has beefed up security to ensure ""order and calm"" during the two-week period celebrating Norooz, stationing 200,000 security personnel across the country, according to Ahmadinejad's official news site. Tuesday's celebrations were closely monitored by police in Tehran, with officers randomly stopping and searching cars around Mohseni Square and other major streets and plazas. Are you in Iran? Send photos, videos of the protests . In one case, brief clashes broke out late Tuesday between revelers and plainclothed members of the Basij, the pro-government paramilitary militia, who chased them away with batons and stun guns. And in one eastern Tehran neighborhood, security forces spray-painted passing cars from which motorists were tossing firecrackers. Police at checkpoints around the city were looking for the marked vehicles. A video posted on YouTube showed what the poster said was an anti-government protest in another Tehran neighborhood, where protesters could be heard chanting ""Death to the dictator."" Earlier in the week, the chief prosecutor in the eastern city of Mashad warned that those who engaged in ""disruptive behavior"" during Chaharshanbe Soori would face ""strong consequences."" It's a precaution that's become increasingly commonplace in Iran, especially in advance of holidays, as the government continues to warn against political demonstrations that have emerged since last summer's disputed presidential elections. The Iranian government quashed anti-government protests that brewed in February as the nation commemorated the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, which marked the end of the country's Western-backed monarchy and the start of an Islamic republic. In the days that led up to the February 11 holiday, the government mobilized security forces and heightened its warnings, saying it would arrest protesters and hold them until the end of Norooz, on April 9. Six protesters who were arrested in December on the Muslim holiday of Ashura were sentenced to death on Monday, the day before Chaharshanbe Soori, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported Monday. Their sentences are being reviewed by an appeals court, Fars said. Another 86 people were found guilty Tuesday of acts against the Islamic republic, Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency reported. The Revolution and Public Court of Tehran said most of the defendants were given prison sentences. Meanwhile, around 350 inmates at Evin prison have gone on a hunger strike to demand that their cases be examined before Norooz, saying their ward is so overcrowded with recent political arrestees that prisoners are in poor health, according to the Committee of Human Rights Reporters, an Iranian group. Eyewitnesses in Iran said thousands of riot police and security officers lined the streets of the capital, Tehran, and patrolled major intersections on motorcycles and on foot Monday night. Beginning Saturday, police also have set up checkpoints along major roads in Tehran, and vehicles have been stopped and searched from late at night into the early morning hours, witnesses said.

"(CNN) -- Rizana Nafeek was a child herself -- 17 years old, according to her birth certificate -- when a four-month-old baby died in her care in Saudi Arabia. She had migrated from Sri Lanka only weeks earlier to be a domestic worker for a Saudi family. Although Rizana said the baby died in a choking accident, Saudi courts convicted her of murder and sentenced her to death. On Wednesday, the Saudi government carried out the sentence in a gruesome fashion, by beheading Rizana. Read more: Outrage over beheading of Sri Lankan woman by Saudi Arabia . Rizana's case was rife with problems from the beginning. A recruitment agency in Sri Lanka knew she was legally too young to migrate, but she had falsified papers to say she was 23. After the baby died, Rizana gave a confession that she said was made under duress -- she later retracted it. She had no lawyer to defend her until after she was sentenced to death and no competent interpreter during her trial. Her sentence violated international law, which prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before age 18. Rizana's fate should arouse international outrage. But it should also spotlight the precarious existence of other domestic workers. At least 1.5 million work in Saudi Arabia alone and more than 50 million -- mainly women and girls -- are employed worldwide according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). Read more: Indonesian maid escapes execution in Saudi Arabia . Again according to the ILO, the number of domestic workers worldwide has grown by more than 50% since the mid-1990s. Many, like Rizana, seek employment in foreign countries where they may be unfamiliar with the language and legal system and have few rights. When Rizana traveled to Saudi Arabia, for example, she may not have known that many Saudi employers confiscate domestic workers' passports and confine them inside their home, cutting them off from the outside world and sources of help. It is unlikely that anyone ever told her about Saudi Arabia's flawed criminal justice system or that while many domestic workers find kind employers who treat them well, others are forced to work for months or even years without pay and subjected to physical or sexual abuse. Read more: Saudi woman beheaded for 'witchcraft and sorcery' Conditions for migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia are among some of the worst, but domestic workers in other countries rarely enjoy the same rights as other workers. In a new report this week, the International Labour Organization says that nearly 30% of the world's domestic workers are completely excluded from national labor laws. They typically earn only 40% of the average wage of other workers. Forty-five percent aren't even entitled by law to a weekly day off. Last year, I interviewed young girls in Morocco who worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week for a fraction of the minimum wage. One girl began working at age 12 and told me: ""I don't mind working, but to be beaten and not to have enough food, this is the hardest part."" Many governments have finally begun to recognize the risks and exploitation domestic workers face. During 2012, dozens of countries took action to strengthen protections for domestic workers. Thailand, and Singapore approved measures to give domestic workers a weekly day off, while Venezuela and the Philippines adopted broad laws for domestic workers ensuring a minimum wage, paid holidays, and limits to their working hours. Brazil is amending its constitution to state that domestic workers have all the same rights as other workers. Bahrain codified access to mediation of labor disputes. Read more: Convicted killer beheaded, put on display in Saudi Arabia . Perhaps most significantly, eight countries acted in 2012 to ratify -- and therefore be legally bound by -- the Domestic Workers Convention, with more poised to follow suit this year. The convention is a groundbreaking treaty adopted in 2011 to guarantee domestic workers the same protections available to other workers, including weekly days off, effective complaints procedures and protection from violence. The Convention also has specific protections for domestic workers under the age of 18 and provisions for regulating and monitoring recruitment agencies. All governments should ratify the convention. Many reforms are needed to prevent another tragic case like that of Rizana Nafeek. The obvious one is for Saudi Arabia to stop its use of the death penalty and end its outlier status as one of only three countries worldwide to execute people for crimes committed while a child. Labor reforms are also critically important. They may have prevented the recruitment of a 17 year old for migration abroad in the first place. And they can protect millions of other domestic workers who labor with precariously few guarantees for their safety and rights. Read more: Malala, others on front lines in fight for women .

"London, England (CNN) -- UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown was under mounting criticism on Tuesday over his perceived casual attitude towards soldiers killed in Afghanistan as support for the mission collapses. Attacks over equipment shortages for British troops in Afghanistan, his failure to bow at a war memorial, and his misspellings in a condolence letter to a soldier's grieving mother all led one commentator to ask: ""Can't Gordon Brown do anything right?"" The Afghan and military issues dominated the British prime minister's monthly news conference at 10 Downing Street on Tuesday, taking up 40 of the 50 minutes he spent at the lectern. Brown stated over and over his sympathy for the families of fallen troops and his determination to see the war effort through. ""Each life lost is an irreplaceable loss from a family,"" Brown said. ""It reminds us all of the stark human cost of armed conflict in the service of our society."" The latest embarrassment for the prime minister emerged Monday, when The Sun newspaper told the story of Jacqui Janes, who received the condolence letter from Brown after her 20-year-old son was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan. Janes told the paper she was ""so angry"" that the hand-written letter was filled with spelling errors -- including her own last name, which Brown spelled ""James."" Brown also crossed out a mistake in spelling the soldier's name and spelled four other words wrong, the newspaper said. ""The letter was scrawled so quickly I could hardly even read it and some of the words were half-finished. It's just disrespectful,"" she told The Sun. ""He said, 'I know words can offer little comfort.' When the words are written in such a hurry the letter is littered with more than 20 mistakes, they offer no comfort."" Brown called Janes to apologize after the article appeared, according to The Sun. Janes recorded the conversation and gave it to the paper, which recently announced on its front page that it was dropping support for Brown's Labour Party in favor of the Conservatives. The paper printed a transcript and published the audio Tuesday; in it, Janes tells Brown that the letter was an ""insult"" to her son and that the spelling mistakes were ""disrespectful."" The prime minister says in the conversation that he had only ""good intentions"" and sympathy for the mother's loss. ""The last thing on my mind was to cause any offense to Jacqui Janes, and I think people know me well enough to know that it would never be my intention -- by carelessness or by failure -- to cause any grief to a grieving mother,"" Brown said at the news conference Tuesday. Just two days earlier, some criticized Brown for another military gaffe -- not bowing his head when he laid a wreath at the Cenotaph, the London military monument those who died in the two world wars, on Remembrance Sunday. It was fodder for talk radio and Twitter, where people debated whether it was intentional. ""It's disgusting because it is not respectful,"" an unnamed former Royal Air Force serviceman told The Daily Telegraph. Some columnists seemed to forgive the prime minister for not nodding his head. ""He attends Remembrance Day at the Cenotaph looking solemn and dignified, black tie and poppy carefully in place, lays a wreath, steps back in thoughtful silence -- and is abused in the papers next day for failing to bow his head,"" wrote John Walsh in The Independent. ""If a politician lays a wreath at the Cenotaph, it's not an insult; it's an expression of respect. And forgetting to adjust your head a certain way indicates you have personal feelings and aren't just going through the motions."" The Guardian's Tom Meltzer suggested that Brown -- who is blind in one eye -- may have been ""distracted by the difficulty of walking down the steps backwards"" after he laid the wreath and simply forgot. But simply the fact that Brown was criticized for not bowing his head indicates how widely unpopular he has become, wrote Richard Littlejohn in the Daily Mail. ""These so-called 'gaffes' can be attributed to Brown's characteristic clumsiness and social dyslexia,"" he wrote. ""But they are magnified by both the unpopularity of the war and the (prime minister) himself."" Brown has already come under repeated criticism for the level of equipment for the 9,000 British troops in Afghanistan, which some have said is too low. The prime minister has defended equipment levels and said he seeks assurances from military officers in the field that troops have the supplies they need. Last week, Brown defended equipment levels in a major speech on Afghanistan. It followed the release days earlier of a military memo, sent in early June, from a British officer that warned a shortage of helicopters was putting British troops at risk because they were forced to travel on the ground, increasing the chances they could be killed by a roadside bomb. The memo was written by Lt. Col. Rupert Thorneloe, who died a month later in a roadside bombing. He remains the highest-ranking British serviceman to die in combat since the 1982 Falklands War. Janes brought the issue up in her recorded phone conversation with Brown, saying her son bled to death because there was no helicopter to take him for treatment. She said she had even had to buy military gear for her son to use -- something other military parents have said as well. ""We have tried to provide the best equipment in the world,"" Brown said Tuesday. ""We have increased the investment we have made in helicopters and in vehicles and in the equipping of the armed forces in a way that we have never done in our country before."" Asked about Janes' accusation that her son died because of a lack of helicopters, Brown said he had asked for a full report on all aspects of the guardsman's death. ""I am assured that in normal circumstances, there is always helicopter capability,"" he said. Tuesday was also the day that the bodies of six British soldiers killed in Afghanistan returned to Britain, their coffins draped in the Union Flag. Five of them were killed in a single incident November 3 at a base in the southern province of Helmand, when an Afghan policeman they had been training fired on them. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. The somber day and the days of criticisms led The Guardian's Meltzer to write, ""Can't Gordon Brown do anything right?"" Roy Greenslade, a media columnist for The Guardian, said no -- not because Brown is doing things wrong, but because the press gives him little slack. ""Brown, it would appear, has no ally in the popular press,"" Greenslade wrote. ""He is being hung out to dry and it is painful to watch. I fear it will get even worse in the coming months.""","UK PM criticized over his government's policy on Afghanistan and personal ""gaffes""

"(CNN) -- A multi-million dollar negligence lawsuit filed by the families of two victims of the 2007 Virginia Tech mass shooting has been dismissed by Virginia's highest court. The state justices said Thursday that given the initial uncertainty and confusion surrounding the actions of the student gunman, ""there was no duty for the Commonwealth to warn students about the potential for criminal acts by third parties,"" meaning gunman Seung-Hui Cho. He went on a shooting rampage on the Blacksburg, Virginia, campus that left 32 people dead. The young man then took his own life. A county jury had awarded the estates of Erin Peterson and Julia Pryde $4 million each, saying the state was negligent. The amount was later reduced to $100,000 per family. The women were students at the state university. Virginia Tech shootings timeline . There was no initial reaction from the families, but a spokesman for state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said the justices' conclusions were proper. ""While words cannot express the tremendous sympathy we have for the families who lost their loved ones in the Virginia Tech shootings of 2007-- including the Prydes and the Petersons -- the Virginia Supreme Court has found what we have said all along to be true: The commonwealth and its officials at Virginia Tech were not negligent on April 16, 2007,"" said Brian Gottstein. ""Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy."" Cuccinelli is the Republican nominee for governor, and the general election is next Tuesday. At issue was the level of responsibility the state -- including university officials, as well as local and campus police -- should bear for the initial handling of Cho's actions, which eventually spread out over several hours. Could his final rampage be reasonably foreseen? Law enforcement on April 16, 2007, received a call of an incident inside a dormitory around 7:30 a.m. Officers arrived to find two gunshot victims, one fatal, and initially believed it be a ""domestic homicide,"" not a prelude to far more lethal killing spree to come. ""Police believed that this was an isolated incident that posed no danger to others and that the shooter had fled the area,"" said the Virginia Supreme Court's 15-page ruling. ""They did not believe that a campus lockdown was necessary."" Lawyers for the families had argued if such a precautionary lockdown was imposed immediately -- where students and the university community would be told to shelter in place -- the subsequent massacre inside an academic building may have been prevented or minimized. A killer in the family . The court concluded university officials were engaged and kept informed of the situation over time. Two hours after the initial incident, members of the University Policy Group -- consisting of school administrators -- sent out a campus-wide ""blast e-mail,"" informing students and faculty of the dorm shooting, and urging those to report anything suspicious. The mass shooting in Norris Hall began about 10 minutes later, prompting another immediate university ""blast e-mail"" stating ""a gunman is loose on campus. Stay in buildings until further notice."" Peterson, 18, and Pryde, 23 were among those murdered by Cho in Norris Hall. He was later linked to both the residence hall and academic building shootings. In general under state law, someone does not have a legal duty to warn or protect from someone else the criminal acts of a third person, unless a ""special relationship"" exists between one or more parties. Such relations might include those between employer/employee, airline/passenger, or innkeeper/guest. All such claims of wrongdoing in this context are fact-specific, and the Virginia court here determined the state reasonably -- if incorrectly -- determined the shooter had left the area. ""Based on the limited information available to the Commonwealth prior to the shootings in Norris Hall,"" said the seven justices, ""it cannot be said that it was known or reasonably foreseeable that students in Norris Hall would fall victim to criminal harm."" School officials expressed satisfaction with the court's conclusions, saying the jury's initial verdict was based on a misreading of state law. ""The court's actions can never reverse the loss of lives nor the pain experienced by so many families and friends of victims of one person. In the end, the cause of these heinous acts and continuing heartbreak was a troubled and angry young man with easy access to powerful killing weapons,"" said Lawrence Hincker, associate vice president at Virginia Tech. The case is Commonwealth of Virginia v. Peterson (121717).","Plaintiffs initially awarded $4 million each in negligence lawsuit .
Award later reduced to $100,000 each .

"(CNN) -- Abby Wambach, the skillful forward for the U.S. women's soccer team, scored dramatic headers against Brazil and France to help the American team advance to the World Cup final. Now she's heading off to the championship match against a tough Japan team, a much-awaited contest set for Sunday in Frankfurt, Germany -- where the U.S. can win the tournament for a record third time. The 31-year-old Wambach, speaking to CNN in a phone interview on Thursday, bubbled with confidence, patriotism, and enthusiasm as the team bids to follow up its 1991 and 1999 successes. She thinks the United States can beat Japan, a team emboldened to score a victory for a nation wracked with tragedy this year after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the country. Who will star at the women's World Cup? Japan, she said, is a ""possession-oriented"" squad that's ""technical on the ball."" ""We have to be patient. We're going to get chances and have moments where we can score goals, and I think physically we're going to be able to dominate them,"" she said. ""So, if we can take care of the chances that we get, put away goals early on.""

And her last-gasp headed goal against Brazil on Sunday -- which got her an ESPN ESPY award for ""best play"" -- helped the U.S. level at 2-2 and take the quarterfinal to a penalty shootout, in which she also scored. Can World Cup spark women's soccer surge? ""Some say maybe it was perfect timing for us,"" she said, noting she was humbled and honored by the ESPY award. ""We believe it's our destiny."" People are gathering in sports bars to cheer on the U.S. team, and the American support for the World Cup team has thrilled the players. ""Pretty amazing,"" said Wambach. ""We really want to make everybody back home proud. We're going to keep this thing going. We have this huge game on Sunday and if we can all play well and keep giving our most and leave everything on the field, hopefully we'll come home as World Cup champs."" Wambach was asked whether she will have another shot at a World Cup, which is played every four years. ""It's a good question but right now my focus is here (in Germany),"" she said. ""This team is special. And this team, I can't put my finger on what makes this team so special, but the fact is we just don't give up. We're not quitters. We won't give up for the entire 90 minutes that we play on Sunday. ""I think we can do this. I know that the players on my team, the coaches, the staff, we've all put so much time and effort into training and preparing for this. We're not going to let it go lightly.

"(CNN) -- Gerry Conlon, who was wrongly imprisoned for the IRA Guildford pub bombing in England in 1974, died Saturday in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He was 60. He was one of the Guildford Four, who were falsely convicted by the British courts and eventually freed in 1989. Conlon had been ill for some time. ""We recognize that what he achieved by fighting for justice for us had a far, far greater importance -- it forced the world's closed eyes to be opened to injustice,"" his family said in a statement. The story of Conlon's struggle for freedom was told in the film ""In the Name of the Father."" ""I served 15 years for a crime I did not commit,"" Conlon said when he finally walked out of prison in 1989, following an appeals court decision to throw out the sentences of the Guildford Four after doubts were raised about the police evidence. It wasn't until 2005 that British Prime Minister Tony Blair apologized to the Guildford Four, calling the false convictions a miscarriage of justice. ""They deserve to be completely and publicly exonerated,"" Blair said at the time. Members of the Conlon and Maguire families were jailed in connection with the 1974 Irish Republican Army bombings in Guildford and Woolwich in England.

"(CNN) -- House Republicans just went through the pageantry of the changing of the guard with their leadership elections. But new names on the door won't change their party's priorities: protecting special interests, the ultra-wealthy and their own perks at the expense of middle-class Americans. The term ""Republican leadership"" has become the biggest oxymoron in politics. If we learned one thing from Republicans' elections, it's that their leadership simply follows their tea party base in an unceasing march to the right. Following their losses at the ballot box in 2012, Republicans rolled out a post-mortem calling for a move to the middle, recognizing that their days as a competitive national party were numbered if they continued on their current rightward path. Since then, we have seen Republicans across the country do the exact opposite. They have grown more paranoid, more insular and more fearful. It's that fear of the tea party that shut down the government to disastrous consequences last year, and it's that fear that just caused them to replace one leader of the Republican shutdown with another. In 2011, when John Boehner took over as speaker, he was billed as a moderate. And Eric Cantor was called mainstream. But both alternated between being hamstrung by and kowtowing to their right wing and drove their majority off a cliff. And the numbers speak for themselves: after three and a half years, they have turned Congress into the least-trusted institution in America. Gallup now pegs confidence in Congress at just 7% â€” the lowest confidence rating for any institution ever recorded by Gallup in the past 40 years. With ratings that abysmal, one might think that House Republicans might use a turnover in leadership as an opportunity to steer their sinking ship in a new direction. Think again. Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise are members of the same tea party club and were elected on pledges of fealty to the tea party agenda. And that agenda will keep turning off the American public, dragging their ratings down and dragging Republicans further and further outside the mainstream. The tragedy is that the middle class pays the price. How did we get to this place, where the House majority continues to move so far from the center of American politics that they can no longer see it? NBC News provides some clues, finding in its polling that ""the Tea Party is in a VERY different place on key issues"" than even other, mainstream Republicans. Take immigration as an example. Just 19% of tea party Republicans believe immigration helps the United States, compared to 47% of the country at large. With House Republicans beholden to this tiny minority of the country at large, they will continue to drag their party to the right â€” and their so-called leadership will have no choice but to follow, if they want to keep their jobs. You can change the names on the door, but the out-of-touch agenda remains the same. If the country is to have any hope of combating the serious challenges facing us and creating an economy that works to lift up middle-class families, we need more than just a change of figureheads in the House. We need to change the House majority. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Rep. Steve Israel says House Republicans' new leaders have same party priorities .

"(CNN) -- More than 100 people accused of planning attacks against police and oil installations have been arrested in Saudi Arabia, an Interior Ministry spokesman told CNN on Wednesday. Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki said 101 people preparing attacks on police officers and 12 members of suicide cells plotting strikes on oil installations were seized over five months. The Saudis have been cracking down on militants for years. The Interior Ministry is publicizing this latest information to make the public aware of the bad intentions of some visitors to the kingdom. The incident that sparked the arrests took place in October 2009, the ministry said. Two Saudi nationals disguised as women fired on a police unit, it said. Police returned fire and killed both men before they were able to detonate their explosive belts. Officers confiscated two extra suicide belts the men had carried with them, along with hand grenades, ammunition and foreign currencies. Intelligence from the incident led to the discovery that local residents had built terrorist cells made up mainly of residents and some foreigners who had entered the kingdom with the aim of committing suicide attacks against national structures and police, the Interior Ministry said. The investigation resulted in the arrest of more than 100 people directly linked to the two Saudi nationals in the October incident, the ministry said. Among those are 47 Saudis, 51 Yemenis, one Somali, one Bangladeshi and one Eritrean. During the arrests of the 101 suspects, police seized weapons, ammunition, video recording devices, computers, communication devices, money and documents, the ministry said. They also found scores of early communication indicating large sums of money paid in advance, . Security officers also came across two suicide bombing cells with six members each and that were working independently of one another but were both linked to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the ministry said. It said officers arrested all 12 members -- 11 Saudis and one Yemeni -- as they were in the early stages of planning attacks against oil and security facilities in the Sharqiya region. The Saudis have been particularly concerned with the terror group since al Qaeda in Yemen merged with its Saudi counterparts to form al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a U.S. official told CNN. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has made it clear its focus is on targeting government and western interests in both Saudi Arabia and Yemen, the official said, adding that this most recent plot does not appear to be connected to any operation beyond Saudi Arabia. Al Qaeda launched a wave of attacks on government buildings, oil installations and international contractors in Saudi Arabia in 2003. The Islamic fundamentalist movement supports the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy and carried out the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, the kingdom's leading ally. The Saudis responded with thousands of arrests and, in some cases, fought gun battles with militants in Riyadh and other cities. Amnesty International last year issued a report saying that Saudi Arabia's campaign against the al Qaeda terrorist network had led to ""massive human rights violations"" by security forces, including torture and the arrest of non-violent reformists. CNN's Octavia Nasr contributed to this report.","Ministry claim accused plotted attacks on police, strikes against oil installations .

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a pediatric surgeon turned public health advocate, died Monday. He was 96. Koop served as surgeon general from 1982 to 1989, under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. He was outspoken on controversial public health issues and did much to raise the profile the office of the surgeon general. He died peacefully at his home in Hanover, New Hampshire, Dartmouth College said in a news release announcing his death. ""Dr. Koop did more than take care of his individual patients -- he taught all of us about critical health issues that affect our larger society,"" said Dartmouth President Carol L. Folt. ""Through that knowledge, he empowered each of us to improve our own well-being and quality of life. Dr. Koop's commitment to education allowed him to do something most physicians can only dream of: improving the health of millions of people worldwide."" Koop, called ""Chick"" by his friends, was perhaps best known for his work around HIV/AIDS. He wrote a brochure about the disease that was sent to 107 million households in the United States in 1988. It was the largest public health mailing ever, according to a biography of Koop on a website of the surgeon general. He was also well-known for his work around tobacco, calling for a ""smoke-free"" society. His 1986 surgeon general's report on the dangers of secondhand smoke was seminal. ""That was the shot heard around the world, and it began to change public policy everywhere,"" said John Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society. The report started the move toward prohibiting smoking on airplanes, restaurants and at workplaces. ""The legacy of C. Everett Koop is how a wonderful, famous pediatric surgeon, who'd already made a name for himself, was willing at a relatively advanced age to do public service and show bold leadership that would have dramatic impact and change the world,"" Seffrin said. Prior to his tenure as surgeon general, Koop was surgeon-in-chief for more than 30 years at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""A pioneer in the field of pediatric surgery, Dr. Koop's contributions include advances in complex surgical procedures, such as the separation of conjoined twins, establishment of the nation's first newborn surgical intensive care unit and the implementation of Children's Hospital's surgical fellowship training program,"" the hospital said in a statement. ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia will be forever indebted to Dr. Koop for the imprint he left upon the institution and upon all of pediatric health care."" Koop was born in Brooklyn, New York, and attended Dartmouth, Weill Cornell Medical College and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He was the author of more than 200 articles and books, and the recipient of various awards. In 1991, Koop won an Emmy for a five-part series on health care reform, Dartmouth said. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995. Known for wearing bow ties, suspenders and having a clipped beard, Koop is survived by his wife, three children and eight grandchildren. His first wife, to whom he was married for nearly 70 years, died in 2007. ""Dr. Koop was not only a pioneering pediatric surgeon but also one of the most courageous and passionate public health advocates of the past century,"" said Wiley W. Souba, dean of the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. ""He did not back down from deeply rooted health challenges or powerful interests that stood in the way of needed change. Instead, he fought, he educated and he transformed lives for the better."" People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .","He is best known for his work on HIV/AIDS and tobacco .

"London (CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's e-mail may have been hacked by private investigators working for British newspapers when he was the country's top finance official, the Independent newspaper reported Monday. London's Metropolitan Police launched an investigation in June into potential computer hacking on behalf of newspapers, after opening separate investigations earlier in the year into phone hacking and police bribery. Authorities refused Monday to confirm they are investigating the potential hacking of Gordon Brown when he was chancellor under Tony Blair. Brown's office did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. But another former top government official said police had spoken to him about the possibility that both his government and personal computers were hacked. Peter Hain, a former Northern Ireland secretary who has long been at the heart of the Labour Party, said police had talked to him about potential hacking between 2005 and 2007. Much of the controversy around phone hacking has centered around the best-selling Sunday tabloid News of the World, which was shut down by proprietor James Murdoch in July in the face of the scandal. The defunct newspaper's parent company, News International, declined to comment on the Independent story. The Independent does not name the newspaper alleged to have employed the private detectives who targeted government ministers. One person has been arrested in connection with the computer hacking investigation, known as Operation Tuleta. The suspect, a 52-year-old man, was detained in the city of Milton Keynes on November 24 and released on bail until March, police said. Sixteen people have been arrested in connection with the phone-hacking probe, Operation Weeting, and eight people have been arrested in Operation Elvedon, the bribery probe -- including two of the same people arrested over phone hacking. The phone-hacking story, long a bugbear of a handful of high-profile celebrities, journalists and politicians, exploded into international prominence last summer with the revelation that people working for the News of the World illegally eavesdropped on the messages of a missing teenager who later turned out to have been murdered. Two former editors of the News of the World, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, have been arrested and released on bail. Prime Minister David Cameron has been criticized for hiring Coulson after the editor resigned when subordinates pleaded guilty to phone hacking. Coulson maintains that he was not aware of the illegal activity. The government set up an independent inquiry running alongside the police investigations, and parliament's media committee has held hearings with witnesses including News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch. His son James has been called twice as lawmakers try to determine how much he knew about phone hacking. Police say notebooks belonging to a private investigator at the heart of the scandal contain the names of 5,800 potential victims. The Independent says police have seized 20 computers in connection with the e-mail hacking probe, and say the machines suggest there could be as many computer-hacking victims as phone-hacking victims. It does not name the source of the claims.","The Independent says Brown may have been a target when he was chancellor .

"(CNN) -- The weekend before Christmas, Mother Nature is gifting -- or, rather, clobbering -- the United States with a little bit of everything. Ice storms, snow, flooding, thunderstorms, tornadoes and record-setting warmth are all in store, and with this maddening mix comes a massive headache for more than 94 million expected holiday travelers. Unless you're on the West Coast, odds are the weather outside is frightful and complex. To make sense of it all, let us take you on a national tour. Southeast: Thunderstorms, tornadoes and torrential downpours . While ice storms and snow wreak havoc in parts of the country, the bigger story that's brewing is about rain and a severe storm event, says CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray. Harsh weather continued Saturday evening, with a risk of thunderstorms in Louisiana, Mississippi, parts of Arkansas, Alabama and Tennessee. Isolated storms that form ahead of these bigger storms could become supercells, which means the possibility of tornadoes. One tornado hit Friday night in Mississippi. By midday Saturday, there were two tornado watches in effect. Saturday night, the National Weather Service in Jackson, Mississippi, said damage in that area -- four semi trucks overturned, five houses heavily damaged and 15 others with minor damage -- was likely due to a tornado. Saturday night, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported one death in Coahoma County, along the Mississippi River. There were no further details. The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning late Saturday afternoon just west of Memphis, Tennessee, and there were reports of some semi trucks overturned on Interstate 40 in that area, according to CNN affiliate WREG. In Hughes, Arkansas, the St. Francis County sheriff told WREG a possible tornado touched down in that area. A spokesperson for the Arkansas Emergency Management Agency tells CNN the storm destroyed two homes and damaged three others. Three people were hurt in the storm, one of with serious injuries. Heavy rain, damaging winds and lightning were forecast to continue Saturday night into Sunday morning. These storms will spread, bringing downpours to Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and up the East Coast on Sunday. Some of the highest rain totals for Saturday occurred in Junction, Illinois, where six inches were reported, and Trumann, Arkansas, where residents had seven inches of rain by late Saturday evening. The main trigger for the severe weather is the above-average temperatures farther north. Midwest: A flood of wet worry . The warm air in this system means heavy rains across the majority of the Midwest and fears of flooding in the Ohio River Valley. Flash flood warnings and watches and flood advisories are in effect from Ohio up to eastern New York, all the way down through Indiana, parts of Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas. Anywhere from 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in some of those areas. On Saturday evening, some low-lying areas of Shelby County, Indiana. were evacuated as the rain continued to fall in central Indiana. Where temperatures are lower, snow will come down across Iowa, Wisconsin and into northwest Michigan. Some areas will see up to 8-10 inches of snow, others around 4-7 inches. And an ice storm is predicted in southeast Michigan. Central Plains: Slammed with ice and snow . Power outages, falling tree limbs -- if not trees -- and treacherous roads are in the forecast for a large part of Oklahoma. An ice warning has been issued for the northern and central parts of the state, including Oklahoma City. Residents there are being encouraged to hunker down at home, CNN affiliate KFOR reports. They're even being warned not to park their cars beneath trees. In Kansas and southeast Nebraska, snowfalls will total 3-6 inches. And those cold temps will keep folks shivering. CNN's Nick Valencia has been bundled up outside Kansas City International Airport in Missouri. ""Just a few days ago people were outside in T-shirts and shorts grilling. Now this,"" he said. And while the roads are of serious concern, he said diehard Kansas City Chiefs fans are also worrying about Sunday's NFL game. So far there have been no flight cancellations or delays at that airport, Valencia said. But Whitney Eichinger of Southwest Airlines told him the company is looking out for the safety of travelers. ""We are allowing customers to rebook their trip with no penalty through tomorrow,"" she said. ""That has more to do with traveling to the airport, not flight cancellations."" The highest snow total of the day was in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, where 12.5 inches had fallen by late Saturday evening. Mid-Atlantic/Northeast: Weirdly warm . If there is one present being handed out on this first day of winter, it is the well-above-average temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic, with record highs up to the 70s anticipated. By Sunday, that warm weather will grace the Northeast, sending temperatures into the 60s. Already, in Boston Saturday, the temperature is in the mid-50s. Farther north, however, the situation is less cozy. In Maine and across New Hampshire, Vermont and into New York, winter weather -- including ice storm warnings and freezing rain -- are in effect. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a winter ice emergency and activated the state's emergency operations center. The National Weather Service in Buffalo issued a winter storm watch for five counties in upstate New York and winter storm warnings for two others. The NWS in Buffalo said up to an inch of ice accumulation is expected, and areas near the St. Lawrence and Black rivers could see even more. CNN's Jennifer Gray, Nick Valencia, Todd Borek and Matt Daniel contributed to this report.","NEW: One death reported in Mississippi, agency says .

"London, England (CNN) -- British premier Gordon Brown's offer to step down as part of a deal to entice the Liberal Democrats into a coalition government with Labour rather than David Cameron's Conservatives provoked a mixed reaction in the UK press Tuesday. In a statement outside Downing Street Monday, Brown announced he would stand down as Labour leader in the autumn and allow a contest for his replacement to begin now. ""Gordon Brown at last wielded his great clunking fist yesterday that Tony Blair had predicted would halt the Conservative advance on Downing Street,"" declared The Times. ""After four days of watching a clumsy courtship between David Cameron and Nick Clegg, the Prime Minister timed his announcement to cause maximum trouble."" UK parties look to resolve deadlock . It added that Brown knew his continued occupancy of Downing Street would be an impediment to any hope of Labour remaining in power and that ""over the weekend, even his closest allies had privately conceded that there was no real prospect of Brown remaining the Labour leader for long."" ""Squat a mess,"" exclaimed The Sun -- an influential tabloid and stable-mate of the Times in the Rupert Murdoch-owned Newscorp empire -- which had switched its allegiance to David Cameron before the election. In a scathing attack, it claimed the ""squatter PM's bombshell had plunged the country into deep political chaos -- with no new government now expected for days."" The Daily Mail, considered the most right-wing of the major UK titles, described Brown's offer to quit as ""a squalid day for democracy,"" and added that many of Labour's old guard openly condemned the prospect of a ""shabby deal with the Liberal Democrats that would deny the keys of Downing Street to David Cameron."" ""I believe it will lead to a lack of legitimacy, and I think the British people will feel that we have not heard what they said to us,"" former Home Secretary David Blunkett was quoted as saying. It added that Brown ally Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alistair Campbell were the architects of Labour's ""audacious"" plan, and accused Nick Clegg and his Liberal Democrat party of ""double-dealing"" by meeting Labour figures over the weekend despite their formal dealings with the Conservatives. The Telegraph labeled Brown's plan ""a very Labour coup"" that had outflanked Cameron as he prepared to enter Number 10. It said Labour was attempting to ""exploit the Tories' reluctance to offer the Lib Dems far-reaching voting reform."" Labour offered to hold a referendum asking voters if they want a proportional representation voting system -- a key issue for the Liberal Democrats. The left-leaning Guardian said Brown's ""last card"" had panicked the Conservatives into making an ""extraordinary"" counter-offer to the Lib Dems: a referendum on the alternative vote electoral system and a coalition government with seats for Nick Clegg's party in the cabinet. This ""hurried Tory offer, previously seen as completely beyond the ideological pale for the party, was swallowed by shell-shocked Tory MPs,"" it said. ""For the greater Gord,"" was the effusive response from the Labour-supporting Mirror, as it painted a selfless picture of a prime minister who had ""fallen on his sword"" for the good of the country.","Gordon Brown announced he would stand down as Labour leader in the autumn .

"(CNN) -- He's a radio icon and onetime voice of a beloved cartoon character. Now 82, Casey Kasem is suffering from Lewy body disease -- a common cause of dementia, a spokesman for his daughter told CNN on Tuesday. And his children say they don't know where he is. A family battle has left Kasem's children and a judge worried about his safety. Judge Daniel Murphy on Monday named Kasem's daughter Kerri the temporary conservator until a June 20 hearing. But she can't take on the responsibility without knowing where he is. And Kerri Kasem says she believes her father's wife ""fled the country (or possibly went to an Indian Reservation) with my Dad because she knew I would win in court today,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""We want as many people to be on the lookout for our dad as possible,"" Kerri Kasem told CNN Tuesday. ""If you see him, if you know his whereabouts, if you hear anything about him, please, call the police. ... This is terrible for his health. A man in his condition should not continually be moved. He's confused. He's probably very afraid, and he's not getting proper medical care."" Sisters Kerri and Julie Kasem told CNN they last visited their father a week ago in the nursing home where he was staying. ""We spent a wonderful few hours with him there,"" Julie Kasem told ""CNN Tonight"" on Tuesday. ""He was able to smile. He was able to say, 'I love you.' When we said, 'We'll be back, Dad, we'll be back,' he looked at us and said, 'When?'"" she said. ""There's so much more meaningful communication we can have with him, and we want him back. He knows that we're his children and he knows how much we love him. And he feeds off of that love, and we feed off his love, and we want him back."" When the Kasem daughters' attorney, Troy Martin, called the day after their nursing home visit to check up on Casey, he was told by the nursing home that he had been removed overnight, the attorney told CNN. Murphy has ordered that Casey Kasem's whereabouts be disclosed, Martin said. Kerri Kasem's rep told CNN a missing persons report is in process. ""The report has been filed,"" the rep said. ""Now they are waiting to speak with the sergeant they have been dealing with on this case."" After becoming conservator, Kerri Kasem got access to her father's doctors and medical records. That's when she learned that he had Lewy body, rather than Parkinson's disease, Deraney said. Previously, the children had said in court papers that they were told their father had Parkinson's disease. Lewy body dementia is the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's, according to the Mayo Clinic. It can be hard to diagnose because Lewy body and Alzheimer's cause similar symptoms, according to the National Institutes of Health. Last year, a judge ruled that Kasem was being well cared for by his wife, Jean Kasem. The judge denied a request by Kasem's children that a temporary conservator be appointed. Attempts to contact Jean Kasem's attorney Monday and Tuesday were unsuccessful. Daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, filed the previous conservatorship petition, claiming the retired radio host ""has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family"" by his wife. In November, Jean Kasem offered a very different description. ""These children single-handedly and irreparably shattered the lives of their father, his wife and youngest daughter, the calm of their home and their neighborhood by engaging in uncalled for public demonstrations and personal attacks in the media,"" she said in court papers, according to CNN affiliate KCBS. ""They are doing so with a professionally orchestrated media and legal campaign that has disgraced their father and vilified their stepmother."" The children ""falsely claim that their stepmother is wicked and is keeping her husband prisoner in his home behind closed doors and that they no longer have access to him through no fault of their own,"" she added. ""... For reasons they know all too well, their presence at this state would be toxic and extremely distressing for Casey, Jean and their daughter, Liberty, who have had enough of their cruelty."" In December, Kerri Kasem told CNN that her stepmother was preventing Kasem's children from visiting their ailing father. ""It's been a very long time. We saw this coming. We weren't blindsided by this,"" she said at the time. ""This is a man we saw every single week, talked to him every single day on the phone until he lost his voice. We are an extremely close knit family, extremely, and his family means more to him than anything,"" ""We tried everything to get her to let us see him when she stopped bringing him over to the house. She had an assistant bring him over to the house so we could see him every weekend. She stopped. My sister went there, knocked on the door and she was escorted off the property."" The petition last year said that Julie Kasem and her husband had been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. They ""have been prevented from exercising their duties"" by Jean Kasem, who has been married to the retired radio host for three decades, the filing said. ""There is no communication between Jean and us and his daughters,"" said brother Mouner Kasem. ""We have no knowledge of how he is, what he's doing, if he's better, if he's worse, and we're scared that we'll never see him again."" Casey Kasem, who for decades hosted radio music countdown shows ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40,"" retired in 2009. Besides the famed countdown shows, Kasem was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon ""Scooby-Doo"" and an announcer for NBC. He was a popular DJ and occasional actor before ""American Top 40"" began in 1970.

"London, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown fought to hold on to his job Thursday in a debate against the two men who hope to replace him, David Cameron of the Conservative Party and Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats. But he lost the debate decisively, according to two snap polls. Cameron came first in both polls, with Clegg second and Brown third. But the debate performances do not seem to have changed voters' minds about whom to back, according to one poll. Just over a third of voters say they favor the Conservatives, and the same number back the Liberal Democrats, according to the poll by ComRes for ITV News. Just under one-quarter prefer Labour, the poll suggests. Those numbers are essentially unchanged from the results after a similar debate last week. In this week's debate, Brown repeatedly insisted that Cameron represents ""the same old Conservative party,"" which would take money out of the economy for ""ideological reasons."" The Conservatives are ahead of Brown's Labour party in most polls, but it's not clear that the lead will be enough to give them a majority when voters cast ballots on May 6. A confident-seeming Cameron fended off Brown's attacks, saying time and again that Brown was wrong on the facts. ""David, you've just got it wrong economically,"" Brown said in one of the sharpest exchange, saying his party was ""the same old Conservative party of the 1930s and the 1980s and the 1990s."" ""Every leading business leader says we have got it right,"" Cameron shot back. They crossed swords again about unemployment, with Brown warning ""we don't want the labor market of the 1980s,"" when the Conservatives were in power. ""It's the same old Tories."" Cameron fired back that Brown doesn't ""even know what country you're prime minister of -- he's caused record youth unemployment."" Full election coverage . Brown continually shook his head as Cameron leveled criticism at the Labour Party, while Cameron tended to stare ahead into the studio audience when he came under attack. Clegg, whose Liberal Democrats are traditionally also-rans but are riding high on the back of their leader's debate performances, struggled to appear relevant as the leaders of the two big parties traded barbs. ""The way they got us into this mess is not the way out,"" he said, gesturing to the politicians on either side of him. The first half of the debate focused on the economy, one of the main concerns on voters' minds. Members of the audience asked about government spending cuts, the fairness of the tax system, bankers' bonuses, and how to rebuild the British manufacturing sector. The debate got even sharper in the second half when the hot-button issue of immigration came up. Cameron accused the Liberal Democrats of wanting an ""amnesty for illegal immigrants,"" while Clegg shot back that the only politician who wanted that was the Conservative mayor of London, Boris Johnson. Voters across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland cast ballots for 650 members of Parliament on May 6. The party with the largest number of MPs traditionally gets the first chance to form the government. Either Labour or the Conservatives usually gets an absolute majority, but polls suggest the Liberal Democrats may capture enough seats to prevent one party from having more than half of the seats in Parliament. Quirks in the voting system mean that the party with the most votes does not always get the most seats. The last time no party got a majority, in 1974, a new election was called within months. Labour has been in power in Britain since 1997, first under Tony Blair, and under Brown since 2007. The Conservatives governed Britain for 18 years before that.","British political rivals clash in final televised debate before May 6 election .

"(CNN) -- Health officials have confirmed that a patient who underwent neurosurgery at a New Hampshire hospital earlier this year had Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. The death, and suspicions that the patient may have had the devastating brain ailment, prompted authorities in two states to warn that as many as 13 patients may have been exposed to surgical equipment used during the patient's surgery, thus to the same disease. The now-deceased patient had undergone neurosurgery at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester. The patient was later suspected of having sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare, rapidly progressing and always-fatal degenerative brain disease. But by the time this diagnosis was suspected, equipment used in the patient's surgery had been used several other operations. This raised the possibility that the equipment might have been contaminated -- especially since normal sterilization procedures are not enough to get rid of the disease proteins, known as prions, tied to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- thus potentially exposing the other patients to infection. The patient's death spurred the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to announce September 4 that eight other patients at the same Manchester hospital were being monitored for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Massachusetts health authorities noted the next day that five Cape Cod Hospital patients may have been exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease too because their surgeons this summer later used the same potentially contaminated medical equipment as in the New Hampshire facility. The diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was confirmed by the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center, which reported its conclusion to New Hampshire's health department and Catholic Medical Center on Friday. ""Though we are not surprised by the test results, we are saddened by the toll this disease takes on families,"" said Dr. Jose Montero, New Hampshire's public health director. People with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease typically show signs of rapidly progressing dementia, impaired vision and personality changes, among other symptoms, according to the National Institutes of Health. Yet while it can be suspected, the only way the disease can be confirmed is through tests conducted after a person's death. The status of the five southeast Massachusetts patients who'd been warned wasn't immediately known Friday night. The eight being monitored at Manchester's Catholic Medical Center have been told about the original patient's ""autopsy results."" ""We let them know we will continue to help and support them and to monitor their health going forward,"" said hospital president Dr. Joseph Pepe, ""even though the risk is extremely low that any of these patients was infected."" Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has a long incubation period before symptoms appear -- sometimes up to 50 years -- according the National Institutes of Health. There's no test, so it may take many years before these patients would know if they were infected. About 300 people a year in the United States come down with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has said that no cases of the disease linked to the use of contaminated medical equipment have been reported in the United States since 1976. Most medical devices are sterilized by heat, but the World Health Organization recommends the use of a caustic chemical like sodium hydroxide to disinfect equipment that may have come in contact with tissues that could cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. CNN's Kevin Conlon and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","A test confirms a New Hampshire patient died of the fatal brain disease .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of four children swept away in a creek swollen by storm waters in western Kentucky were recovered Friday morning, local authorities said. The first body was recovered shortly after midnight; two others were located about 30 minutes later, said Graves County Sheriff Dewayne Redmon. Missouri officials assisting in the search later found the fourth body. The children were traveling with their Amish family in a horse-drawn carriage on a flooded street in Graves County when the carriage flipped over Thursday evening, said Jerry Beasley, a Kentucky State Police spokesman. In all, there were six children and their mother in the carriage, Beasley said . The mother and two children were able to get to a safe area. But the other four children were swept away with the carriage into a nearby creek.","NEW: Authorities have recovered the bodies of four children in Kentucky .

"(CNN) -- Cue the screams: One of the hardest-working couples in show business is headed on tour. On Monday, Jay Z and Beyonce announced a joint summer trek that will take them to 16 cities throughout North America, starting in June. The married couple first stirred anticipation that they'd tour together in early April, but the buzz was initially dampened by Jay Z revealing that his 2014 ""Made in America"" music festival will play in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

"(CNN) -- Leaders from Britain, Ireland and Northern Ireland appeared together Friday to hail an agreement that saves the province's power-sharing government. The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) called it a ""good day"" for the province, and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said it opened a ""new chapter"" for Northern Ireland. ""Let it be said in times to come that after decades of violence, years of talks, weeks of stalemate, this is the day we secured the future, a lasting peace, power being where it should be -- in the hands of the people of Northern Ireland, the strongest answer to those who would bring violence back to our streets,"" Brown said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also praised the accord, calling it ""another important step toward a full and lasting peace."" The United States is prepared to help ""build upon their efforts by promoting a new spirit of cooperation among all parties,"" she told reporters. Sinn Fein and the DUP, the two largest political parties in the province, have been in a bitter political standoff for months over police powers and how to devolve them, or bring them under local control. They held 10 days of talks before reaching an agreement Thursday. Brown and Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen flew in last week for emergency talks with the parties when it seemed the negotiations might fail. Had no agreement been reached, it could have brought the collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly -- the legislature -- and forced new elections. Because the power-sharing deal set up by the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 is fragile, there were fears that new elections might imperil the peace process. ""People across Northern Ireland feared that if the political process failed, they stood to lose all that had been achieved over these last few years,"" Brown said. ""But what we have found in our talks is that, while the purpose of the discussions was an agreement on police and justice, what has emerged is more than that -- a new spirit of cooperation and mutual respect."" Brown said the devolution of policing and justice powers will happen April 12. In addition, the British government has agreed to finance that devolution by making 800 million pounds ($1.26 billion) available, Brown said. Earlier, Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams called the deal a ""wonderful chance"" for Northern Ireland to move forward. ""Today presents us, I think, with another new beginning,"" he told reporters. The pro-Irish Sinn Fein has favored devolution, and Adams said it always seemed ""a bit ridiculous"" that the Assembly was not allowed to legislate on issues affecting its own people. The agreement reached Thursday with the pro-British DUP will help Northern Ireland take ""more and more possession of our own affairs,"" he said. ""There will be begrudgers, but those that have been driving this need to go forward and forget about what happened for the last year or so, and see this as a genuine 'an tus nua,' a new beginning,"" Adams said, using Gaelic. DUP leader Peter Robinson also said the agreement secures a positive future for Northern Ireland. ""No future generation would forgive us for squandering the peace that has been so long fought for,"" Robinson said. ""No sane person wants to go back to the carnage, instability, violence ... that we have endured over recent generations.""","British and Irish PMs meet after power-sharing deal agreed in Northern Ireland .

"London, England (CNN) -- They are some of the most spectacular diamonds, rubies and sapphires in the world, and they have graced the outfits of monarchs for centuries, now -- just in time for Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee -- Britain's Crown Jewels have gone on display in a new-look exhibition. ""The Crown Jewels are a collection of international significance, some of the most stunning gems in the world,"" said curator Sally Dixon-Smith. ""But they are also a working collection, and we wanted to get that across to visitors; that they are real, and that they are very much used, both during coronations and more regularly."" Once through the heavy steel doors -- weighing 2,000 kilos each -- visitors are guided through the process of coronation, allowing them to feel part of the procession, with all its pomp and circumstance. After following a line of golden trumpets and heavy maces, they are introduced to the regalia of the ceremony: Robes, anointing oil and ceremonial swords, before coming face to face with the fabled gems themselves, set in a succession of stunning crowns, scepters and orbs. Fashion and treats fit for a Queen . Even their names are the stuff of legend: Koh-i--Nur, the Black Prince's Ruby, Cullinane I and II, King Edward's Sapphire. Some even come with their own superstitions. The Koh-i-Nur (its name means ""Mountain of Light""), for example, is only ever set in crowns made for female members of the monarchy. Read more: The Royal family tree . ""It is said to bring bad luck to any man who wears it,"" explained Keith Hanson, the chief exhibitor of the jewels. ""By contrast, it is believed to bring long life and happiness to any woman who wears it, and as its last wearer, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, was 101 when she died, that would seem to be true."" The jewels that visitors see today have been worn by British monarchs for generations, but in historical terms, Dixon-Smith says, they are ""a relatively new collection."" The originals were destroyed in the wake of the Civil War, which saw King Charles I overthrown and executed in 1649. The oldest piece on display is the 12th century Coronation Spoon, which survived the break-up (and melting down) of the old jewels. Many of the items in the Tower of London today date back to the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and the rule of King Charles II, though the collection has been added to and expanded over the centuries since. Perhaps the most important piece is the St Edward's Crown, which dates from 1661, and is worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation. Made of solid gold and trimmed with ermine and velvet, it is famously heavy -- weighing more than five pounds (2.23kg) -- and can only be worn for 15 minutes during the ceremony. Read more: What does the queen really do? By contrast, Queen Victoria's tiny diamond-encrusted crown, made in 1870, measures less than 10cm (3.7 inches) tall. It was designed to be worn over her mourning veil, following the death of her beloved husband, Prince Albert. And while Queen Victoria wore that miniature coronet so often it was eventually placed on her coffin, after her death, one of the other pieces, the Imperial Crown of India has only been used once. The crown, which features more than 6,000 diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds, was made in 1911 at a cost of Â£60,000. It was used for the crowning of George V at the Delhi Durbar, because the traditional Crown Jewels are not permitted to leave the country, but has not been worn since. The new exhibition has been six years in the making, with most of the work being carried out overnight, to allow the Crown Jewels to remain on display throughout. Thousands of visitors pour in to the Tower of London every day, though Hanson insists ""there are no queues here -- only 'lines of expectation.'"" And the fact that the jewels are one of the key attractions for international visitors to London has played a large role in the way they are now displayed, with little writing and a reliance instead on imagery and film, from animations, to painting, to film of the Queen's 1953 coronation. ""The point is not to tell people about the collection, but to show them -- the Crown Jewels are the stars of the show,"" said interpretation manager Rebecca Richards. The exhibition also features dramatic lighting and sound effects, designed to allow the precious stones and gold to glow and shine in all their glory. ""They are not relics,"" said Richards. ""They are part of an active tradition, and they are still used today."" So while anyone making a trip to the Tower can expect to be greeted by plenty of glitz and sparkle whenever they visit, they shouldn't be too surprised if they find a small card in place of the Imperial State Crown, reading simply: ""In use.""","Britain's Crown Jewels contain some of the most famous precious stones in the world .

"London, England (CNN) -- How big is big? How open is open? Conservative leader David Cameron has said his power-sharing offer to the Liberal Democrats following the unresolved UK election is ""big, open and comprehensive."" But will it be big enough to tempt them to ally with a traditional political opponent? Will it be open enough to persuade those in both parties who fear that essential principles or interests will be sold out? Will there be a Conservative/Liberal Democrat deal at all? If not, could a Lib Dem/Labour deal keep Gordon Brown in Downing Street as prime minister? After knocking the stuffing out of each other for four weeks, Britain's major political parties are now jostling to buy each other a drink. Listen to their public statements and you might believe, if you had spent most of your life in Fairyland, that they are doing so in the ""national interest."" In fact they are doing so because all three of them failed to win the election and because the outcome has left them all playing a numbers game in search of at least a share of power. All three party leaders are under pressure. What happens next for UK politics? Prime Minister Gordon Brown is under the most direct pressure -- the pressure simply to quit -- because his party secured its lowest vote since the disastrous election of 1983 and shed 91 seats in Parliament. Although he stays on for the moment at least in Downing Street as prime minister, Brown's moral authority has taken a hammering. His only hope of remaining there is if he can negotiate a deal with the Lib Dems. But he will only get the chance to attempt one if David Cameron's Conservatives and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats have already failed to clinch a deal. Brown's Labour Party is a more natural bedfellow for the Lib Dems than Cameron's Tories. Labour and the old Liberal Party had a pact from 1977-79. Both are parties of the center left. Brown had already, before the election, promised action to reform the voting system, a key issue for Clegg's party. Brown is far more likely than Cameron to offer the Lib Dems their Holy Grail of proportional representation (their share of seats in parliament suffers under the current system). Spurning his advances could see the Lib Dems lose their biggest chance ever of obtaining that. But the weakness of Brown's position is that if you add his 258 Labour lawmakers to Clegg's 57 then it only gives them a total of 315, still short of the 326 required for a bare majority in the Commons, which initiates and passes legislation. It would be a perilously unstable coalition, looking for others allies among nationalists from Wales or Scotland or among Ulster Unionists. Add Clegg's 57 to Cameron's 306 and you have a healthy 363. David Cameron and his Conservatives were the nearest thing to a winner in the election. But Cameron too faces pressure. Many in his party are asking how he failed to win them an outright majority when they were up against an unpopular Prime Minister at the end of 13 years of Labour rule and the public was hurting from the biggest recession in living memory. Those on the right of Cameron's party resent his re-branding , or as some put it 'de-toxifying'' of the Conservative party. With his bold, and many would say graceful, public offer to the Lib Dems Cameron has accepted political reality and at the same time taken a huge gamble. If he fails to bring off a deal then it will be seen as a compounding failure by his critics. But he will be in internal trouble too if, in order to clinch the deal, he concedes more than his party hardliners would like. Many Tories are viscerally opposed, for example, to voting reforms, especially proportional representation, because they fear that it would ensure that future British governments are nearly always ""progressive"" coalitions between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. If Cameron doesn't clinch a deal with Clegg and the Lib Dems go off and strike a deal with Labour , thereby allowing Labour to continue in government, then Cameron too may have missed a key opportunity to become prime minister. By the time he next fights an election, Labour will almost certainly have replaced Brown with a more appealing , younger figure. If he couldn't seal the deal with the British electorate against Brown , then Cameron may find it much harder going next time. Ironically, although the Liberal Democrats lost seats at the election -- despite the breakthrough they seemed to have achieved after the first TV leaders debate -- Clegg has found himself in a high profile position as the potential kingmaker. But he too has his pressures. There are plenty of Lib Dems who would be appalled at their party linking up with a Tory Party that is more Euroskeptic than at any time in its history. Plenty feel that Cameron is merely trying to lure them in as cover for a program of slashing government spending. Lib Dems and Tories could forge some common ground on civil liberties, on education, on taxation reform, on green issues and on civil liberties questions such as scrapping Labour's plan for identity cards. But the two parties emphatically don't agree on Europe, on immigration and on the future of the Trident nuclear missile system. Above all, many Lib Dems feel that they could not trust any offer on voting reform from a party that is instinctively opposed to reform in general and to proportional representation in particular. But what if Clegg were to reject the Tory invitation and do a more advantageous deal on voting reform with Gordon Brown, who is offering a voting reform referendum? Then, he knows, the resulting group would be hounded by the predominantly Tory-inclined UK media as a ""coalition of losers"" who had put back in No 10 Downing Street a man who comprehensively lost the election. Hardly the ""change"" which was the essence of Clegg's campaign message. Clegg's allies in particular are insisting that, against a menacing economic backcloth, their man is acting in the national interest. Certainly he has won plaudits from some unexpected quarters for talking first to the Conservatives and thus honoring his pledge during the election that the party winning the most votes and seats deserved the first chance to form a government. But persuading his own party, a party which sometimes carries a tinge of sanctimoniousness with it, that he has achieved an honourable deal may not be easy and he might lose some senior figures along the way. In Brussels, Berlin, Rome and Amsterdam they know all about the process of bargaining for position in hung parliaments. In Britain it is an unusual spectacle, a game that hasn't been played for 36 years. Horse-trading is not always a pretty sight. It is difficult to do it without a fair amount of straw -- and worse -- sticking to your suit. But the UK may have to get used to it -- especially if ends up with a new voting system.","No party won a clear majority in British election, resulting in hung parliament .
The UK has not had a hung parliament since 1974 -- and parties are not used to bargaining .
Much depends on the Liberal Democrats and which party it allies itself with .
One result of the current uncertainty is that the UK edges toward a new political system ."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Can this G-20 summit prove to be anything more than group therapy for a bunch of fingernail-gnawing, troubled individuals? U.S. President Barack Obama and British PM Gordon Brown want financial stimulus assurances from the G-20. The prospects are not good. The men and women called together in London by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown to counter an economic slump are politicians -- just at a time when the world's electorates are demonstrating their lack of faith in governments and in their ability to understand, let alone sort out, the economic mess. Thirty, 20, even 10 years back there used to be some belief that getting the power-players together could solve problems, or at least give others a push in doing so. But it was once said of a former U.S. Secretary of State, ""There was never any world situation so bad that a few well-chosen words from John Foster Dulles couldn't make it a hundred times worse."" The main task of this London summit may be simply to avoid doing that. The British talking down of expectations over the past few days has been significant.  Up front, on camera, ministers make optimistic noises.  Behind the scenes diplomats warn of a potential lose-lose scenario. If the summit fails to agree, it will destroy what is left of any confidence in the world's trading centers.  Who's who at the G-20 » . But if the G-20 leaders do sign up to an agreement, it is likely to be so anodyne that it won't make any difference, other than boosting a few participants' opinion poll ratings at home a notch or two for being seen to try. It was always unreal to imagine that the economic ministers of the G-20 nations were going to re-write their budgets in 24 hours in London. And since the G-20 doesn't have a permanent secretariat, who is going to enforce anything they do agree? The run-up to the summit has revealed essential differences in approach between the principals. U.S. President Barack Obama and Brown both favor driving on fiscal stimulus, even if the governor of the Bank of England is cautioning his prime minister he can't afford to throw any more money at the problem.  Obama, Brown together before the G-20 summit » . Brown and Obama have limited room for maneuver since both their countries have such hefty current account and budget deficits. They just don't have the money to do it themselves, and they may have trouble persuading those who do have the cash to use it. In an uncomfortable reminder of serious divisions over the Iraq war, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and France's President Nicolas Sarkozy, each with more national traditions than Obama and Brown, and with their welfare states already pumping money into their economies as unemployment increases, are pursuing a different agenda. Blaming ""Anglo-Saxon economics"" and dodgy banking practices for the mess, they don't want more funds injected.  Watch the view from France » . They want to focus on tougher regulation of the financial community. They want the summit to start re-writing the global rulebook on capitalism. Sarkozy, a man constitutionally uncomfortable unless the spotlight is shining on him, has even threatened to walk out of the G-20 proceedings rather than sign up to anything he doesn't consider tough enough on reining back tax havens, policing hedge funds and restricting the bonus culture. Facing growing unpopularity at home, he is back on the ""moral capitalism"" kick he evidenced when holding the EU presidency. The intriguing thing is that the economic crisis and Brown's lining up with Obama, who has proclaimed his belief in the enduring ""special relationship"" with Britain, has revived the Franco-German alliance which used to dominate EU affairs and which had seemed to wither under Merkel and Sarkozy. She doesn't like his touchy-feely ways, he finds her incremental style of politics frustrating. They had drifted apart, but they are back sharing a political tent. Their agreement does not just make life uncomfortable for Brown. It means that on his first trip outside the U.S., Obama is facing unexpected tensions with instinctive allies and the possibility of being associated with discord and failure. He must be disappointed too at the overall contribution from the EU, which sees many of its newer members to the east struggling for survival in the economic slowdown. The EU response has been insignificant, poorly co-coordinated, and divided. Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, has outlined six areas on which the Europeans hope the summit will focus. They include, tactfully, both Brown's fiscal stimulus and Sarkozy/Merkel's tougher regulation of markets. The big question on the fiscal stimulus front is: What will China do?  The Chinese perspective » . Brown's hope is that China, worried about the safety of its money invested in the U.S., will be ready to commit extra funds to fighting the world recession. But if he agrees to do so, President Hu Jintao will surely exact a price. Already the G-8 countries have seemingly conceded that the world's current problems are too big for them to solve and that G-20 is a more appropriate forum. If China comes up with the money to help, it will need assurances that it will in the future enjoy greater power within such multilateral institutions as the IMF and the World Bank. The U.S. and Europe, who have dominated the G-8, now have little option too but to accept a new world order. The G-20 meetings -- remember that chap George Bush who called one in Washington last November? -- have given Asia, India, China and Latin America a much-needed voice at the top table. Whatever the outcome in London it is unlikely now that the G-8 alone will ever carry the same sway. And not surprisingly, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who hosts this summer's G-8 in Sardinia, has proposed that its gathering should be immediately followed by one of the G-20.","First challenge for G-20 is to not make things worse .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former President Bill Clinton says that Hillary Clinton, his wife and the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, needs time to not only decide whether she will run, but what she would bring to the race if she did. In an interview with CNN in Vietnam, Bill Clinton said that although Hillary Clinton hasn't asked him for advice on her 2016 decision, he thinks that the former secretary of state ""really does need some time to think through this."" ""We've reached a point in our life when we think you really shouldn't run for office if you don't have a clear idea of what you can do and a unique contribution you can make and you can outline that,"" Clinton told CNN's Anna Coren. ""Now that the book is done, she wants time to think about that and work through it. I think so much of politics is background noise, and we don't need the background noise anymore."" The former President was in Vietnam as part of the Clinton Foundation's work on global health in Southeast Asia. Hillary Clinton's latest memoir, ""Hard Choices,"" published earlier this summer to much fanfare and a frenetic book tour. While sales of the 600-page-plus tome have not hit publishers' expectations, the book tour has put Hillary Clinton on the forefront of political conversation and raised the specter of her likely bid for the presidency in two years. Hillary Clinton has also become more comfortable with acknowledging that she is considering a run at the presidency during the book tour. While months ago Clinton would not entertain questions about a run, more recently she has answered questions without pretense and speculated about what her campaign would look like. ""We have to make a campaign about what we would do,"" Hillary Clinton said about a possible 2016 run last week. ""You have to run a very specific campaign that talks about the changes you want to make in order to tackle growth, which is the handmaiden of inequality."" Bill Clinton 'fine' with her decision either way . Bill Clinton told Coren that he is ""fine"" with whatever decision Hillary Clinton eventually comes to on 2016. The former President did say, however, that his wife would be a ""really good"" commander in chief. ""She is the ablest public servant I have ever worked with, even if she is my wife,"" Bill Clinton said. ""She's smart, but she's also uncannily able to move from A to B to C. She gets things done and she is strong, she's just good, she is just really good. She would be really good. But it's a decision that only she can make, and I'm not going to try to jump the gun and if she decides not to do it, I'll be happy too."" Bill Clinton has long been careful to not weigh in too forcefully on what he hopes his wife will do in 2016. In an interview last week with India's NDTV, he said Hillary Clinton ""will have to make the decision and I am not going to put my thumb on the scale either way."" Last month, during an interview with NBC, he described himself as only a ""bit player"" when it comes to her presidential decision. In his interview with CNN, Bill Clinton said that now is his time to take a back seat to his wife's ambitions. ""When I left the White House and Hillary went into the Senate in New York, I told her, I said, 'For 26 years you have made a lot of sacrifices for my public life. So I'll give you the next 26 years and if I'm still around we will fight about what we are going to do after that,' "" Bill Clinton said. ""So we are just over a little half way through the second 26 years and whatever she wants is fine with me."" Hillary Clinton spent much of the couple's first decades together helping her husband's political ambition. In 2000, after eight years in the White House and five terms as first lady of Arkansas, Hillary Clinton became the first first lady to win elected office when she successfully ran for New York's open Senate seat. She would later unsuccessfully run for president in 2008, but serve as President Barack Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. A cloud over the book tour . It is what Bill Clinton did after the White House, though, that has clouded much of the last month for Hillary Clinton's book tour. In the first interview of the tour, Hillary Clinton told ABC that her family was ""dead broke"" when they left the White House. Although the family was in debt because of mounting legal fees, Clinton failed to mention her family's post-presidential windfall of book deals and speaking fees. A CNN analysis of the family's financial records in early 2013 showed that Bill Clinton had earned $106 million from paid speeches since leaving the presidency behind. Since leaving the State Department in 2013, Hillary Clinton, too, has cashed in on being a highly sought after speaker by charging upwards of $275,000 a speech. Republicans seized on the storyline and tried to make the argument that Hillary Clinton is out of touch with most Americans. Democrats close to Clinton pushed back, but some admitted in private that the attacks hurt the former secretary of state. Bill Clinton told Coren that the storyline was a ""fabricated"" one that ""shows you how desperately, sadly we are dependent on a new level of political gossip every week."" ""Most people would think that being 16 million dollars in debt would qualify as being dead broke,"" Clinton said, citing a number higher than the $2.28 million to $10.6 million figure that was cited on their federal financial records. Defending his time on the paid speaking circuit, Bill Clinton said that after leaving the White House and paying his debts, he ""wanted to try and save enough money so that if anything happened to me, Hillary and Chelsea could both be in public service if they wanted to be, and I don't apologize for that."" ""I don't think it's a bad thing to make money,"" Bill Clinton said. ""I think it's bad if you live in a system that's rigged against the poor and the middle class. That's a very different thing and the purpose of politics is to create a system of shared opportunities and shared responsibilities.""","Hillary Clinton ""really does need some time to think through this,"" he tells CNN's Anna Coren .

"London (CNN) -- Media magnate Rupert Murdoch traveled to London Friday as he seeks to rein in a crisis over alleged misconduct at the embattled Sun newspaper, part of his huge News Corp. empire. Murdoch's visit follows the Saturday arrests of five Sun journalists as part of an inquiry into alleged illegal payments to British police and officials. In what appeared to be a bid to boost morale, Murdoch told staffers at The Sun -- Britain's best selling newspaper -- that the company will launch a Sunday edition of the paper. Staff at the paper have reacted angrily to the arrests and internal investigations of their journalistic practices, which they have likened to a witch-hunt. The launch of a Sun on Sunday newspaper to replace the News of the World, a sister paper to The Sun that was shuttered amid a phone-hacking scandal in the summer, had been widely rumored. However, this is the first time News Corp.'s UK subsidiary, News International, has confirmed the move. In an e-mail to staff at The Sun, Murdoch said the company would ""build on The Sun's proud heritage by launching The Sun on Sunday very soon."" He also said he had great respect for the ""exceptional journalism"" produced by The Sun, but that it must abide by the law. ""My continuing respect makes this situation a source of great pain for me, as I know it is for each of you,"" he wrote. ""We will obey the law. Illegal activities simply cannot and will not be tolerated -- at any of our publications."" In a sign of support for the arrested journalists, none of whom have been charged, Murdoch said all suspensions had been lifted and that they could return to work. News Corp. will cover their legal expenses, he said, adding: ""Everyone is innocent until proven guilty."" But he made clear that the newspaper could not protect anyone who had paid public officials. The arrests are part of Operation Elveden, an investigation running in parallel with a police inquiry into alleged phone hacking by the media, London's Metropolitan Police said. The five journalists, aged 45 to 68, were arrested at their homes in London, Kent and Essex on suspicion of corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to both offenses, police said. Their arrests followed those of four current and former Sun employees two weeks earlier in connection with the same investigation. Allegations of payoffs to public officials by Sun employees threaten to bring the UK crisis across the Atlantic to the United States, where the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prevents companies from paying bribes overseas. ""At the moment it appears he is ready to sacrifice the journalists and journalism in London to do whatever it takes to be seen to be cleaning up his act there so that it will play better in the United States,"" Andrew Neil, a former editor of Murdoch paper, The Times, told CNN Thursday. ""The consequence of that is quite amazing -- The Sun, which is the most loyal newspaper Murdoch has ever owned -- now believes it is being hung out to dry and the Sun journalists are turning against them."" Murdoch's UK interests only represent a $1.6 billion slice of his $32 billion News Corp. empire, which includes movie studio 20th Century Fox, the Fox Broadcasting Co. and Harper Collins Publishers, as well as The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones newswires. ""This is for Rupert Murdoch no longer about journalism. This is about defending News Corp., his American based parent company, from judicial action and investigation in the United States,"" Neil said. Such actions could put broadcast operations, the most profitable part of the News Corp. operations, in jeopardy, said Porter Bibb of Mediatech Capital Partners in New York. ""If it can be proven that anybody working for News Corp. bribed or gave money to an official of a foreign government -- i.e. the UK -- that's a clear violation and the Justice Department will start the wheels in motion, and I think that's what Rupert Murdoch has been gearing up for in the past few months,"" Bibb said. Following the arrests, Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corp, assured an executive he would continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper, according to an internal staff memo sent by News International Chief Executive Tom Mockridge. Mockridge also said he was ""very saddened"" by the arrests of deputy editor Geoff Webster, picture editor John Edwards, chief reporter John Kay, chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker and John Sturgis, who is a news editor. Analysis: Murdoch empire - and journalism - on the line . News Corp. said in a statement last Saturday that it ""remains committed to ensuring that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past will not be repeated."" News Corp.'s Management and Standards Committee, set up in the wake of the scandal that engulfed the News of the World tabloid, provided the information to police that led to the arrests. The move prompted fury among many reporters at the paper. Trevor Kavanagh, associate editor of The Sun, wrote a column Monday in which he said the paper's journalists were being subjected to a ""witch-hunt."" ""The Sun is not a 'swamp' that needs draining. Nor are those other great News International titles, The Times and The Sunday Times,"" he wrote. ""Yet in what would at any other time cause uproar in Parliament and among civil liberty and human rights campaigners, its journalists are being treated like members of an organized crime gang."" He said it was right police inquiries are carried out separately from the journalists under investigation. But he added: ""It is also important our parent company, News Corp, protects its reputation in the United States and the interests of its shareholders. But some of the greatest legends in Fleet Street have been held, at least on the basis of evidence so far revealed, for simply doing their jobs as journalists on behalf of the company."" Murdoch may be hoping his visit to London will lessen the anger felt by staff at The Sun, Britain's best-selling newspaper. Editor Dominic Mohan has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million. The arrests of the Sun employees comes after Murdoch-owned newspaper News of the World was alleged to have hacked into private voice mails of a wide range of public officials, celebrities and victims of crime. The phone-hacking scandal prompted Murdoch's son, News Corp. executive James Murdoch, to shut down News of the World in July. The best-selling British newspaper was 168 years old. So far, News Corp. and its subsidiary companies have paid more than $200 million in legal fees and settlement of 59 of 60 lawsuits filed over phone hacking claims. James Murdoch is facing new e-mail evidence that would have made him aware of widespread phone-hacking at the newspaper. The younger Murdoch has appeared twice before UK. lawmakers and said he had no knowledge of the practice.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Police continued to block off a key government district in India Tuesday in an effort to stop protesters angered about the gang rape of a woman. Furious weekend demonstrations rocked the Raisina Hills section of New Delhi as public outrage surged. The protests started after a 23-year-old woman was sexually assaulted and beaten to near death on a bus on December 16 by a group of six suspects, now under arrest, police say. The security barriers throughout the Raisina Hills area, home to the presidential mansion, the parliament building and federal ministerial blocks, did not stop protests in other areas Monday. Read more: Police crackdown amid outrage over gang rape . Scores of young students held demonstrations at the Jantar Mantar observatory, a regular protest site, some distance from the restricted area in New Delhi. Many demanded immediate convening of a special session of parliament to amend laws to make rape a crime punishable with death. ""We are not satisfied with the prime minister's statement. Our protests will continue until parliament sits immediately to pass stringent laws on sexual assaults,"" said Om Prasad, a protester. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh again expressed solidarity with the rape victim in a televised address on Monday. He also reiterated an earlier appeal for calm and a pledge of safety for women and children. Read more: Indian prime minister calls for calm after violence erupts during anti-rape rallies . On Sunday, incensed protesters defied a police ban on demonstrations, clashing repeatedly with police. As officers sprayed water cannons, some dispersed, while others huddled tightly in a circle to brave high-pressure streams in the cold December weather. A police officer, who suffered injuries during the protests died in a hospital Tuesday, said police spokesman Rajan Bhagat. Also the 23-year-old rape victim remained in a critical condition at another hospital in the city. Doctors treating her said Monday her condition had worsened. She has been treated for internal bleeding and is receiving ""high doses of antibiotics"" for an infection. Reported rape cases have increased more than tenfold over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. New Delhi alone reported 572 rapes last year and more than 600 in 2012. Authorities haven't released the name of the rape victim, but protesters are calling her ""Damini,"" which means ""lightning"" in Hindi.

"(CNN) -- One half Indian, the other Pakistani, they are the most talked-about partnership in tennis. Dubbed ""the Indo-Pakistan Express,"" Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi hope to end their breakthrough year with a showdown at the infamous Wagah border that divides their countries. Bopanna, an Indian Hindu, and Qureshi, a Pakistani Muslim also aged 30, reached their first major doubles final at the U.S. Open in September and climbed to eighth in the world rankings. Yet their work off the court has attracted just as much attention as they try to soften the often-fractious relationship between their two nations since partition in 1947. The pair have been honored with a string of awards for their humanitarian work in the past 12 months, and are determined to start picking up tournament titles in 2011. Can champion duo's reunion spark an Indian tennis boom? But a showpiece clash at the notorious border crossing that hosts a nightly pageant between India and Pakistan's border forces would be the perfect way to carry their ""Stop War, Start Tennis"" campaign into the new year. ""We're thinking how to get to a wider audience and spread the message of peace through our partnership and thought,"" Qureshi told CNN's Open Court. ""How about playing a match at the Wagah border, with Rohan playing on the Pakistani side and me on the Indian side for a gesture of friendship? ""At the U.S. Open the ambassadors to the United Nations for Pakistan and India both came to watch the semifinals and finals. That was a huge deal because normally you don't see two diplomats cheering for one cause -- it was a really positive sign. I just hope in the near future we can have that match at the border, that would be great."" The village of Wagah, near the Indian city of Amritsar and the Pakistani city of Lahore, is the only road border crossing between the two countries, and the daily ceremony -- which includes a lot of strutting, stamping and saluting -- regularly attracts a crowd of thousands. A match there could be a watershed moment for a pairing that first emerged in 2003 but did not make a major impact until this season. Their burgeoning partnership on court is allied to a deep-rooted desire to strengthen links between two countries which have a long and deep distrust of each other. ""We're both brand ambassadors for an organization called Peace and Sport,"" Bopanna said. ""Right now we're trying to see if we can help tennis in both our countries, promote it and keep the sport growing as much as we can."" As well as receiving the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award at the recent ATP World Tour Finals in London, they were also given the Peace and Sport Award for 2010 at a glittering ceremony in Monaco. The citation read: ""Their commitment to promoting peace between the two countries and their conviction that peace was possible was shown amply during the year."" Joel Bouzou, president of the Peace and Sport Foundation, added of the proposed Wagah match: ""The sport is ready for peace. Will the two governments rise to the occasion?"" Their partnership may have attracted plenty of headlines but for Qureshi, teaming up with his Indian counterpart made perfect sense. ""I've been playing with Indian players ever since I started playing tennis,"" he said. ""Unfortunately there are not that many Pakistanis on the tour, and playing with an Indian was actually the most natural thing that came to me -- having the same language, most of the time having the same dinner, Indian or Pakistani foods in the evening. ""The first time I ever traveled to India when I was 16, I was one of the top [Pakistani] juniors and he was one of the top juniors in India and that's how I got to know him. ""Knowing his attacking style of play, I always knew if we played together we'd be able to make a really good impact. I think results clearly show in that way I was right, though normally he tells me that I am always wrong!"" As well as their run to the final of the U.S. Open, where they were beaten by the Bryan brothers from America, they also enjoyed success at Wimbledon which made them household names back home. ""This year we made the quarterfinal at Wimbledon and that was very, very big in Pakistan,"" Qureshi said. ""I've always told him I think he's the most popular Indian guy in Pakistan this year! ""I can thank him enough for that because obviously without him I wouldn't have been able to achieve all those goals, and with him being my best friend on the tour it makes it the icing on the cake. It's been a great journey so far.""","Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi are the most talked about doubles pairing in tennis .

"(CNN) -- The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit Tuesday that seeks to stop the state of Florida from purging voters from registration rolls. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Florida program clearly violated voter registration laws. ""We have done all that we can to try and reason with the people in Florida,"" Holder told a Senate committee at a hearing Tuesday in explaining why the lawsuit would be filed. Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, argued earlier Tuesday that removing non-U.S. citizens from lists of registered voters was a legal necessity. Appearing on CNN's ""Starting Point,"" Scott said the state had identified ""almost 100 individuals"" who had registered to vote but weren't U.S. citizens. ""Over 50 of them have voted in our elections,"" Scott said. ""I have an obligation to enforce the laws of our land. You don't get to vote in Florida if you're a non-U.S. citizen."" The lawsuit comes after the department began questioning the legality of the state's so-called voter purge program, which would remove names from Florida's voter rolls months before the 2012 presidential election. Florida is considered a key battleground state in the race between President Barack Obama and certain Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Using information from Florida's Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the state identified more than 100,000 names of non-eligible voters that could potentially be on the lists illegally. The Justice Department contends the Florida program improperly uses the information collected from old driver's license applications, saying the data could be outdated. ""A number of persons will subsequently have become citizens and lawfully registered to vote,"" the department said in a letter Monday. Critics say the plan unfairly targets minorities and paint it as an attempt to dissuade typically Democratic voters from going to the polls. Scott said Tuesday that claim was bogus. ""This is not a partisan issue,"" he said on CNN. ""This is not Republican or Democrat or independent issue. This is an issue that I want, all of us want, everyone wants every U.S. citizen to go and register to vote. Participate in elections. But non-U.S. citizens shouldn't be doing that."" Florida, which itself is suing the Department of Homeland Security for access to a citizenship database, was within its legal rights in moving ahead with the purge, Scott said. In 2008, Obama won Florida with 51% of the vote, and the state is classified as a ""toss up"" on CNN's Electoral Map in 2012. There are 29 electoral votes at stake.","Attorney General Holder says Florida is violating federal voter registration laws .

"(CNN) -- On Friday, first lady Michelle Obama turns 50, and the party, we hear, is going to be fantastic. There's even a rumor BeyoncÃ© will perform. The first lady proves 50 is certainly no signifier of slowing down or calling it quits, even if the AARP does consider you worthy of membership. The list of other powerful, in-their-prime women and men over 50 is miles long. Chances are Brad Pitt, Rita Wilson, Oprah Winfrey, Janet Napolitano, Daniel Day Lewis, Meg Whitman, and their many, many cohorts can attest to some of the pros of turning the Big 5-0, among them: . 1) You can forget about contraception. Probably. Although it is biologically possible for many women to get pregnant after 50, it's generally much, much harder and less likely: Women older than 47 account for just .01% of births. Of course, the children you already have might be teenagers. Many women, like Michelle Obama, who chose to have children in their 30s will reach 50 with teens living in the house, and might be facing all the stress, angst and struggle that comes with seeing a child through adolescence. Up next: College tuition! 2) You're perfectly content to stay home on a Saturday night. In your 20s, you might have felt a certain self-consciousness -- guilt, perhaps, or anxiety -- if your Saturday night was spent in your sweatpants on the couch rather than out being social. These days, whether you're married or single, you might have less energy, but you also know that a weekend night in doesn't spell doom for your social life. 3) Yes, it's hot in hereâ€”those are, after all, hot flashes you're having. But that's OK. While menopause can be a slog lasting as long as 12 years, the upside is not having to deal with periods. Ever again. Not to mention PMS, cysts, fibroids, or the aforementioned late-in-life pregnancy. Depression is less common post-menopause. Besides, there's nothing like a hot flash on a cold day. 4) Fifty years in, you know who you are. As Michelle Obama told Parade magazine last summer about reaching 50, ""I have never felt more confident in myself, more clear on who I am as a woman."" Many people cite their 50s as the best decade, when you know what you want personally and professionally and know -- at least better than you did in your 20s or even 30s, at least -- how to go about getting it if you haven't already. 5) That said, it's not too late to change direction. More and more people over 50 are taking on ""encore"" careers, reinventing themselves in professions that might more closely align with their passions. Nonprofit group Encore.org, dedicated to helping professionals find their ""second act,"" notes that as many as 9 million people age 44 to 70 are getting paid for work that combines their personal passion with a social purpose. 6) Mentorship isn't over. Though the traditional mentor-mentee relationship puts the older, more experienced worker in the teaching role, just because all your mentors have retired doesn't mean you have no one left to learn from. A recent trend has seen millennials mentoring boomers, teaching them about technology and keeping them current and vital. Some companies have introduced ""reverse mentoring"" programs designed to pair younger employees with older ones. 7) You sleep less -- and can therefore do more. Studies have found that people need less sleep as they age, leaving them plenty of time to go for a run, work on a project, or do anything else your 20-something cohorts aren't doing while they're dozing an average extra seven hours a week. 8) You can age however gracefully you'd like. If you're going gray, you can flaunt it, and you can be proud of your laugh lines. But if your crow's feet or other signs of 50 years well-lived bother you, there are more options than ever before to do something about it, with fewer stigmas attached. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons reports that minimally invasive facial rejuvenation procedures such as Botox, Juvederm, chemical peels and the like have reached an all-time high. Also growing: eyelid surgery and facelifts. 9)  You're your own meteorologist. Medicine has long disputed that achy joints can predict coming rain, but the old joke may have some truth to it. Doctors are coming around to the idea, admitting that those with arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibroid myalgia, or nerve damage in the knees, elbows, and other joints -- more likely, of course, as you grow older -- can indeed feel ambient changes. 10) You're not 60! Enough said, right? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: Michelle Obama turns 50, and shows it isn't about slowing down .
Drexler: The list of powerful, in-their-prime women and men over 50 is miles long .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- We are all Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The callous, brutal shooting down of an airplane carrying 298 human beings could have happened to almost any other aircraft, carrying any other people, from anywhere in the world. Indeed, in New Delhi, reports suggest that two Air India flights were nearby when MH17 crashed; one of them, Air India One, was carrying Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Frankfurt back to the Indian capital. Indian officials have been quick to offer their condolences to the families of the deceased. As a growing number of world leaders accuse Moscow of creating Frankenstein's monster, of giving Ukraine's pro-Russia rebels the heavy artillery that brought down MH17, New Delhi is so far remaining on the fence. In its ugliest hour, facing the likelihood of unprecedented sanctions, authoritarian Russia can count on at least one powerful ally: India, the world's largest democracy. Russia and India, bedfellows? Sound surprising? It shouldn't. Just last week, before the MH17 disaster, at a BRICS summit in Brazil, Modi expressed his country's deep affection for Russia. ""Even a child in India, if asked to say who is India's best friend, will reply it is Russia,"" declared the Indian Prime Minister. Or consider how, at a speech in Moscow last year, then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said these words: ""Russia has stood by India at moments of great international challenge, when our own resources were limited and our friends were few. ... Indians will never forget."" Both Modi and Singh were pointing to decades of steady relations, starting with India's independence in 1947 and its brush with socialism in the 1950s, through the Cold War years and the breakup of the Soviet Union, up to the present moment, with the two nations in the middle of joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan. The special friendship has disappointed a number of India's other allies. Washington has been frustrated by New Delhi's silence on Russia's annexation of Crimea. Ukraine is even more upset. In an interview with the newspaper The Hindu, Ukraine's ambassador to New Delhi said it especially behooved India to ""make a more clear statement on supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" given its aspirations to be a U.N. Security Council member. On paper, it would seem that India and Russia are unlikely partners. They share little by way of history or culture, are run on completely different ideals of government and have opposing economic and demographic trajectories. According to a recent Pew survey, 45% of Indians have a ""favorable"" view of Russia. Meanwhile, 56% of Indians view the United States favorably. Surely the U.S. -- the world's second largest democracy -- would be a better official ""best friend"" for India? If only. As Indian commentator Rajeev Sharma put it in an essay last year, ""the Americans are known to be fast in finding new friends when it suits their national interest and faster in dumping them for the same reasons."" Russia has been a more reliable ally, according to Sharma. It has long been India's biggest source of arms and, unlike the United States, has largely avoided doing business with India's perennial enemy Pakistan. Opinion: Putin's big blunder . But if Russia becomes more and more isolated, how long would India stay loyal? At what point would considerations of trade, arms and energy give way to a vision of what India stands for? In the coming weeks and months, India's government -- a fresh set of leaders with a rare, sweeping mandate for change -- will begin to formulate its foreign policy. It will need to redefine India's place in the world. Put simply, you can't be everyone's friend. The collective opinion and moral stance of the world's largest democracy matters. It is easy to say nice things about relations with France, the U.S., Brazil and the UK, as New Delhi has done so adeptly in the last few weeks. It is much tougher to manage unpopular friendships.","India has a long history of friendship with Russia .

"(CNN) -- Red Star Belgrade have been excluded from next season's Champions League for failing to meet their debts. The Serbian champions -- also known as FK Crvena Zvezda -- were found to be ""in breach of a number of provisions of the UEFA Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations,"" a statement on UEFA's website said. Red Star were due to enter the Champions League at the second qualifying round stage due to commence on July 15 and 16. The Chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body reported the case in early April ""after becoming aware of the existence of overdue payables as a result of a complaint,"" the UEFA statement continued. ""Accordingly, Crvena Zvezda are excluded from participating in the 2014/15 UEFA Champions League for which they had qualified on sporting merit."" The club now have ten days to decide whether they will appeal the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. City rival and league runner up, Partizan Belgrade, could be awarded Serbia's Champions League spot in Red Star's place while the country's football association may face a UEFA investigation of its own for granting a license to the club. UEFA has looked to crack down on clubs overspending in recent years, introducing financial fair play rules which aim to stop teams getting into unmanageable debt. Europe's governing body handed down sanctions to nine clubs last month, including English and French champions Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, for falling foul of the new rules.","Red Star Belgrade banned from 2014/15 Champions League tournament .

"(CNN) -- Tom Cruise's latest movie may be just the ""Edge"" the actor needs. Since 2011's ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" -- his last feature to cross the $100 million mark at the domestic box office -- the 51-year-old has had a spotty track record. The 2012 comedy ""Rock of Ages"" and the 2013 sci-fi drama ""Oblivion"" were both mildly received by audiences and film critics, while his 2012 outing as Lee Child's imposing Jack Reacher didn't fare much better. But with Friday's ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" critics are placing their bets on Cruise. Directed by Doug Liman, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" stars Cruise as a military PR rep who finds himself thrown into a battle against an alien invasion. Cruise's character swiftly dies, only to find himself in a sort of time loop that causes him to come back to life. Yet every time Cruise's Maj. William Cage returns to the land of the living, he is acquiring more skills to help him stay alive and potentially reach victory. The person helping him navigate the war zone is Emily Blunt's warrior-like soldier Rita Vrataski. The plot might sound convoluted -- it's based on the Japanese novel ""All You Need Is Kill,"" and has elicited more than one comparison to ""Groundhog Day"" -- but the movie has received largely positive reviews. ""Just when you were ready to give up on the summer season and its cookie-cutter, been-there blockbusters, 'Edge of Tomorrow' saves the day,"" raves the Los Angeles Times. ""It's a star-driven mass-market entertainment that's smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions."" Part of the movie's fresh appeal is its casting of Cruise as the guy who doesn't want to dive right into the action. As The New York Times' Manohla Dargis points out, we've become used to seeing Cruise walk on screen fully equipped as the grim action hero, and his ""Edge of Tomorrow"" role is essentially the antithesis of that. ""(W)atching him glide through the opening of 'Edge of Tomorrow' ... it's hard not to think, 'Where has this guy been?'"" Dargis writes. ""It's been years since Mr. Cruise felt this light on screen."" Blunt as his co-star is no slouch, either. USA Today calls her Cruise's ""action-hero equal,"" making ""Edge of Tomorrow"" ""better for it"" -- and, as a whole, Time's Richard Corliss was impressed. ""A furiously time-looping joy ride, (it's) the smartest action film of the early summer season,"" Corliss says in his review. ""The movie's only static element is its title, which oddly suggests a mashup of TV soap operas."" (Well, unless you count the tedium that can set in from watching Cruise ""live, die and repeat"" over and over again, as The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy warns.) But, as any studio head can tell you, good buzz is just half the battle in building a summer blockbuster. And with heady competition from ""The Fault In Our Stars,"" Variety's Brent Lang is predicting the teen romance will hold back ""Edge of Tomorrow"" at the box office. If Cruise doesn't re-emerge as box office king, he can at least rest easy knowing he's won over several critics once again. ""(G)ive Cruise credit,"" says Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty. ""Not only is he hard-headed enough to get right back on the horse that bucked him, but he manages to show us why he still matters as a movie star.""","Tom Cruise's new sci-fi movie is in theaters .
It's been met with largely positive reviews .

"(CNN) -- Some 10,000 demonstrators against the Ukraine's decision to not sign a landmark trade deal with the European Union descended on a square outside a monastery early Saturday in response to a police crackdown on the earlier protests. The emboldened demonstrators waved Ukrainian and EU flags and sang the national anthem outside the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery, where groups of protesters retreated earlier after a sweep by riot police left seven people hospitalized and dozens under arrest at Independence Square. Three top opposition leaders called for resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych as well as new presidential and parliamentary elections, according to a statement released by Vitaliy Klitchko, Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Oleg Tyagnybok. ""We have to unite in order to punch,"" said Klitschko, a Ukrainian boxer and opposition leader. ""We have to unite all together. I alone will not be able to do it...We will not be able to do anything without the support of the people. We have to unite."" Chants of ""Knockout the criminal!"" rose from the square. Yatsenyuk said the president has ""the blood of our children, the blood of students, the blood of youth on his hands."" Yanukovich, in a statement posted on his website, condemned the violence and said he supported ""peaceful civil protest."" He vowed to punish those responsible. Separately, in a post on his Facebook page, Prime Minister Mykola Azaroz said he was ""outraged"" by events at Independence Square but said it was too early to make ""firm conclusions."" He said an investigation was under way. ""Now one thing is clear: the one who is not interested in such a scenario ... is the government,"" said the statement, according to a translation by the national news agency. ""On the contrary, our task is to maintain peace and stability in the country."" Earlier Saturday, riot police detained at least 35 people after peaceful protesters thronged the main square in the capital, Kiev, to voice displeasure with the decision of Yanukovych's government to suspend the EU talks last week. But riot police stepped in early Saturday and ""brutally dispersed"" several hundred people who were demonstrating peacefully in support of Ukraine's European integration, according to a statement from Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""Forceful dispersion of peaceful demonstrations does not help the cause of Ukraine's integration with Europe,"" ministry spokesman Marcin Wojciechowski said. ""We caution Ukrainian authorities against using force as it may carry unpredictable and irrevocable consequences."" The United States condemned what it called ""violence against protesters"" in a statement posted online by the U.S. Embassy in Kiev. A statement released Saturday by the U.S. State Department said, ""We urge Ukraine's leaders to respect their people's right to freedom of expression and assembly... We call on the Government of Ukraine to foster a positive environment for civil society and to protect the rights of all Ukrainians to express their views on their country's future in a constructive and peaceful manner in [Kiev] and in other parts of the country. Violence and intimidation should have no place in today's Ukraine."" State news agency Ukrinform cited the Ukrainian Interior Ministry as saying the use of force by riot police was prompted by ""provocations"" by protesters. The protesters ""started throwing garbage, glasses, water bottles and burning sticks onto the law enforcers. Thereafter, the police pushed protesters from the Independence Square,"" the ministry is quoted as saying. Police detained 35 demonstrators early Saturday for hooliganism and resistance to law enforcement officials, Ukrinform cited police as saying. They have since been released, the news agency said. Ukrinform quoted Kiev police as saying that riot police were called in after protesters began throwing objects at law enforcement officers who were moving equipment into independence Square ahead of New Year holidays. Some 35 people sought medical help in the wake of the clashes, the news agency quoted the head of Kiev's ambulance service as saying. Tear gas and batons were also used against demonstrators earlier in the week as they clashed with police. 'Extreme danger for Ukraine' European lawmakers and diplomats reacted with alarm to news of Saturday's crackdown on protesters. Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner responsible for enlargement of the bloc, said via Twitter that he was ""following events with great concern;"" he urged authorities ""to refrain from use of force against those peacefully expressing their views."" The authorities in Ukraine may have refrained from signing the agreement, he said, ""but they should not refrain from respecting freedom of assembly & expression."" Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt tweeted: ""I fear that Yanukovich has decided on a policy of repression. But still hope that other voices will speak up. Extreme danger for Ukraine."" He added, ""Authorities in Kiev must fully respect the freedom of expression and the right to peaceful manifestations. These are core European values."" Britain's envoy to Ukraine, Simon Smith, tweeted that he was ""hugely disturbed this morning to see pictures of deplorable intimidatory violence"" against a peaceful protest in Kiev. The proposed landmark deal, the EU's ""Eastern Partnership,"" was aimed at creating closer political and economic ties and fostering economic growth among the nations of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, including Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus. Georgia, Moldova and Azerbaijan all took steps toward closer EU integration at a summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Friday, but Ukraine did not sign an association agreement as expected. Speaking in Vilnius, Yanukovych indicated the door wasn't shut to closer EU integration in the future, but said further negotiations were needed to protect Ukrainians from economic harm. ""I reaffirm the intentions of Ukraine to sign the association agreement in the nearest future,"" he said. Economic pressure . Independence Square was the scene of huge popular protests in 2004, when the so-called ""Orange Revolution"" resulted in a new presidential vote after a rigged election was annulled. The response to the thwarted EU deal has put scenes of protest there back on TV screens around the world. But Ukraine's president is in a tight spot. Under severe economic pressure from his country's giant neighbor, Russia, not to join the EU, he also was facing a key EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: free former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his political opponent. Two years ago, in a case widely seen as politically motivated, she was found guilty of abuse of office in a Russian gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison. Her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment. Yanukovych will discuss with German Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to hold trilateral talks among Ukraine, Russia and the European Union on trade and economic cooperation, Ukrinform quoted Ukraine's deputy prime minister as saying Saturday. Russia wants Ukraine to join its Customs Union trade bloc, which also includes Kazakhstan and Belarus. Yanukovych 'unmasked' Tymoshenko's daughter, Eugenia Tymoshenko, told CNN on Friday that Yanukovych's decision not to go ahead with the EU agreement revealed his true motivations. ""After Yanukovych rejected the signature, he took off his mask,"" she said. ""Now we can see his real, true authoritarian face and that he never really intended to go towards Europe or, moreover, fulfill the criteria for the democratization of Ukraine."" David Kramer of Freedom House, a U.S.-based nongovernmental organization, said: ""Yanukovych has decided it's more important to keep Tymoshenko in prison than to integrate Ukraine closer toward Europe. He has left his country vulnerable to Vladimir Putin's threats and pressure. That will be Yanukovych's legacy if he doesn't reverse course.""

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Atletico Madrid won the Spanish league title in extraordinary circumstances Saturday courtesy of a draw at Barcelona that denied the Catalan club the crown. In a breathless end to a compelling La Liga season, the 1-1 draw meant Atletico won their first championship since 1995/96 and in doing so they broke the hearts of the majority of the 98,000 fans present at the Camp Nou. It was the Uruguayan defender Diego Godin who wrote his name into Los Rojiblancos' folklore, the 28-year-old rising high to plant a header into the Barca net just after halftime and stun the home side who were hoping to win their fourth title in only five seasons. But after Godin had canceled out Alexis Sanchez's fabulous first-half strike for Barca, the defending champions could find no way back against a team which has defied the odds for most of the season. Now Atleti will turn their attentions to the unlikeliest of doubles as they face city rivals Real Madrid in a mouthwatering Champions League final in Libson next Saturday. As a result they will not have long to celebrate this triumph, but it is nevertheless one of huge significance as it has broken the stranglehold Barcelona and Real Madrid have enjoyed over the rest of La Liga for a decade. The last time neither of the biggest two teams finished top of the pile was in 2003/04, when Valencia beat Barca to the title. Barca, in truth, looked a shadow of the side that has dominated Spanish football for half a decade. After a season of turmoil on and off the pitch, Gerardo Martino's side simply did not have the tactical nous or energy with which to overpower an Atletico team who refused to bow to their more illustrious opponents. It has been a chastening few months for Barcelona. President Sando Rosell resigned in January after allegations surrounding the acquisition of Brazilian forward Neymar last summer, former coach Tito Vilanova tragically passed away in April and club lynchpins Carles Puyol and Victor Valdes have said their goodbyes as they leave the Camp Nou for pastures new. All the while Barca have struggled on the pitch after a superb start to the season, exiting the Champions League at the hands of Atletico and losing the Spanish Cup final to Real Madrid in April, in the meantime letting the title slip out of their grasp when it was theirs to lose after a 4-3 win at Real in March. Down to the wire . It was the league no-one could win as Barca, Real and Atleti all threw away points in the final few weeks of the season; the underdogs from Madrid blowing their first chance to win the title outright when they were held 1-1 at home by Malaga last weekend while Barca were drawing 0-0 in Elche. But when it came down to Saturday's once-in-a-lifetime showdown at one of the great cathedrals in world sport, Atletico did not fluff their lines, instead producing a performance that owed more to glorious guts and determination than the glamorous 'tiki-taka' style with which Barca have won trophies and hearts aplenty in recent years. And in a league that swung from Barcelona to Real Madrid to Atletico and back all season long, it was no surprise that the once-in-a-lifetime final day showdown saved some of its best twists and turns for the dramatic denouement. Going into the Camp Nou contest Atleti were three points ahead of Barca and knew a draw would be enough; Barca needed to win and they would take the title by virtue of a better head-to-head record, which is how the final standings in Spain are determined. In glorious sunshine Barca began brighter and Atleti were soon rocked by injuries to two of their most decisive players, as first talismanic striker Diego Costa -- reportedly on his way to Chelsea in the summer -- and then classy midfielder Arda Turan limped off in tears at the prospect of their seasons being curtailed so cruelly. When Alexis seized on a Lionel Messi chest pass in the Atleti box after 33 minutes and rifled a ferocious right-foot shot into the roof of the net from an audacious angle, suddenly Barca were the ones in the driving seat. But they were also suddenly the ones with everything to lose, and Atletico had clearly not come so far to be denied. It was the first time Barca had led Atleti in a match since February 2012, seven meetings ago, and they looked uncomfortable doing so as the visitors took the game to them with renewed gusto. Heading into history books . At the start of the second half they came out like a train, and after David Villa -- who won the title with Barca last year -- struck the base of the post, Godin rose majestically to score the goal his career and this most remarkable of seasons will be remembered for. If Atletico looked like they had thrown it away before they were not going to make the same mistake again. Neymar entered the fray for Barca and he gave them a much greater attacking potency, but Simeone has his team playing in his own image and they blocked and tackled and leaped and chased as if their very lives depended on it. Messi had a goal rightly ruled out for offside and Dani Alves' 25-yarder stung the palms of Thibaut Courtois in the Atlei goal but they allowed Barca no closer and as the minutes ticked down, the illogical turned into the inevitable. The 480-strong band of Atleti fans -- parked right up in the gods at the imposing Camp Nou -- sung their hearts out, and when the final whistle came and their coaching staff raced on to the pitch to celebrate, the players collapsed as one to the turf in collective disbelief at what they had just done. In the face of such heartbreak, the reaction from the Barca fans was magical -- they stood to a man to applaud the team that had just deposed them as Spanish champions and even sang ""Atleti, Atleti"" as the players rose to their feet to acknowledge what was happening around them. If winning the league with a playing budget one-fifth the size of Barca's and Real's is a modern day fairy tale in a sport where money increasingly talks, then this finale was pure Hans Christian Andersen. In Lisbon next Saturday, the brilliant Simeone will hope to cause yet another mighty upset and write one final, captivating chapter in the remarkable story of Atletico Madrid's season.","Atletico Madrid crowned champions of Spain following 1-1 draw against Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Exploration is challenging. If it's too easy, then it's not real exploration. So says Wong How Man, a Hong Konger who in 1974 began leading expeditions into what was then one of the world's most isolated countries -- China. ""It was a time when China had very few friends, so we decided to step in and help with what we could put together; funding and expertise,"" says Wong, founder of the China Exploration & Research Society. In those early days China was only just opening up. It was the tail end of the Cultural Revolution and there were a lot of restrictions. Bureaucracy and disappointment were the order of the day. Wong doesn't like to recount the red tape he faced because ""it's like living through the pain."" A number of times when he returned to Los Angeles, where he was living at the time, he considered switching his expeditions to another part of the world. But China always drew him back. Remote regions open up . Today it's a very different place. Rapid development hasn't just boosted the economy -- it's opened up vast swathes of the country. In 1985, when Wong led an expedition to find the source of the Yangtze River, he says he and his team traveled for nine days on horseback. They faced not only the challenge of high altitude, but snow, rain and hail. He returned 10 years later to find the same journey took just five days. Another decade saw times reduced even further. ""When I did it in 2005, it took just three days because the road was much closer. Now we could probably drive all the way to the source,"" says Wong, who began leading expeditions for National Geographic before setting up CERS. Expeditions into western China once involved huge amounts of off-roading, but today large mining companies are on the ground and the region is crisscrossed with roads. ""Now if we get stuck, we ask for help from the miners,"" says Wong. Though easy access is opening up once very remote regions, the traditional way of life is disappearing. In 1985 Wong says he discovered a small community that trained otters to help them fish. Twenty years later just one family still used this technique. ""Before there was this wide open field to explore,"" says the 65-year-old former journalist. ""When you have roads going in left and right, if you have to look really hard to explore, then maybe it's not where I want to be."" The next frontier . Today Wong has to look harder to find truly out of the way places he deems worthy of exploration. He says the best remaining sites are on China's frontiers. China shares land borders with 14 countries -- Mongolia, Russia, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. The often complex cultural and historical backgrounds of frontiers can make them especially interesting, but timing is everything when it comes to the exploring border regions. As its relationships with its neighbors are sometimes volatile, countries fall in and out of favor. ""You always have to look at timing. What wasn't possible suddenly may become possible,"" says Wong. During a visit two years ago to China's border with Vietnam, Wong said political unrest made exploration problematic. On the Indian border, it's currently a different story. China and India's political and trade ties are better than they've been for many years, opening it up to exploration. Wong's top frontier pick is China's northeastern border with Russia. While the Harbin Ice Festival might draw the crowds, he says this is the place to be in winter. Here, the Amur River freezes so solidly that it's possible to drive over it in a four-wheel drive vehicle. Wong went there recently to catch up with some reindeer herder friends. ""You can drive almost to the source of the Amur River, the 10th longest river in the world, and see the border troops talking to each other, people ice fishing and crossing the river even through they're not supposed to,"" says Wong. The Chinese border with Laos, near the Golden Triangle, is another region ripe for exploration, particularly for those interested in hill tribes. ""It's fascinating to look at the dynamics between people at borders,"" says Wong. ""A lot of the time the locals are closer to the people across the border than they are to their respective governments, which are far away."" Wong says the border between China's southwestern Yunnan province and Myanmar is also ripe for exploration, as it is free from the political complications of more sensitive areas close to Tibet or Vietnam. Still, Wong can't resist a challenge. He recently set off on a month-long expedition to western Tibet -- a trip made easier by a new road, but complicated by red tape. New visa regulations made it impossible for non-Chinese members of the team to join. As always, he is prepared for further trouble and has several backup plans up his sleeve. ""Exploration has to involve some logistics, some difficulty. If you're like a sprint runner, 'Oh, I got there first and I'm home already and on the computer sharing it on Facebook,' then I don't call it exploration,"" says Wong.","Journalist Wong How Man has been exploring China's most remote areas since 1974 .

"(CNN) -- It's going to take two to three weeks for thoroughbred California Chrome to heal from a nasty injury to his hoof, his trainer Art Sherman said Sunday. ""He's got a lot of talent,"" Sherman said of the colt that was the favorite for the Belmont Stakes but was denied his shot at becoming the first Triple Crown in 36 years. Tonalist was victorious Saturday at the storied race in Elmont, New York. California Chrome finished in a dead heat for fourth with Wicked Strong. Sherman said the colt's injury occurred during ""the first jump."" ""He just needs a little time off,"" Sherman said, explaining that the injury is ""superficial"" and not ""deep."" Sherman assured that California Chrome will not be in any pain as his injury is treated in part with a special bandage, and his recuperation will involve some ""pasture time."" As to what went wrong for a horse who many thought would win Saturday, Sherman alluded to the amount of racing California Chrome did leading up to the Belmont Stakes. The colt, which brought in $3.5 million this year, ran his third Triple Crown race in five weeks. Eleven horses competed in the Belmont Stakes. Sherman suggested Sunday that, as with any athlete, rest is just as pivotal as racing and training. ""I think you need a little more time between races,"" he said. Jockey Victor Espinoza seemed optimistic that Chrome would recover. ""Thank you to everyone for your support on this journey, you are awesome! I hope California Chrome gets better soon,"" he tweeted Saturday evening. California Chrome's owner Steve Coburn was incensed Saturday that none of the top three finishers had raced in both the Derby and Preakness, the two prerequisites to the Triple Crown. Those horse owners took ""the coward's way out,"" Coburn blasted. Coburn didn't ease off his comments Sunday. On ABC, he was asked whether he regretted his rant. ""Not only no, but hell no,"" Coburn answered. ""I do not regret it one bit. It's the truth."" He was asked if he thought the rules should change so that horses should have to participate in the other two races to run at Belmont. ""Yes I do, I mean think of it this way. OK, it says Triple Crown. You nominate your horse for the Triple Crown -- that means three. The Triple Crown trophy has three points on it. So when you earn enough points to be in the Kentucky Derby, those 20 horses that start in the Kentucky Derby should be the only 20 allowed to run in the Preakness and the Belmont, for the Triple Crown."" At a news conference, Sherman was asked what he thought of Coburn's comments at the race. Coburn was in ""the heat of the moment,"" he said. ""Sometimes your emotions get in front of you."" CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","Trainer says California Chrome won't be in any pain while his injury gets treated .

"Washington (CNN) -- As President Barack Obama decides whether to strike ISIS inside Syria, he has political considerations as well. U.S. lawmakers are watching critically as Obama weighs options on how to deal with the threat from ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Many have argued the surge of ISIS is the direct result of lack of strategic action to date from Obama, while others are questioning how broadly Obama's executive authority extends when it comes to taking militarily action. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, tells CNN that unless the United States or its citizens face an imminent threat from ISIS, Obama must seek approval from Congress before extended airstrikes against ISIS inside Syria. ""I do think the president should come to Congress if he intends to embark on airstrikes in Syria for the purpose of trying to defeat ISIL,"" Schiff said Saturday. ""If we're talking about the same kind of more general airstrikes we're undertaking in Iraq, that's something that would broaden the mission significantly. And, frankly, I think the case hasn't been made for that yet."" Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and a Republican from California, told CNN that he'd support the use of armed drones on ISIS in Syria. ""I think strikes at this point, against the Syrian ISIS, which has bled into Iraq, those steps should be taken,"" Royce said. ""Had they been taken some time ago, I think ISIS would not have as much influence on the ground as it has now."" U.N.: 'Unspeakable' suffering in Iraqi town besieged by ISIS fighters . Royce said he would not, however, support putting U.S. troops on the ground. ""There is no support in the United States on either side of the aisle for introducing ground troops there,"" Royce said. ""The question is: do we support the Kurds? Do we support the Free Syrian Army in their effort to turn back ISIS? And in doing that, we need to give them the heavy equipment such as anti-tank missiles that desperately they need."" ""The most important aspect of this is that this needs to be a dialogue between Congress and the administration in terms of having a strategic plan forward in supporting the Kurdish forces on the ground,"" said Royce. ""That's the infantry that is right now advancing against ISIS, and they need the support."" Perry piles on President . Republican Gov. Rick Perry of Texas tied the ISIS threat into a broader critique of six years of the Obama doctrine. ""When we think about where we are in the international scene, we think about the lack of leadership,"" Perry said. ""When we see what's happened in Libya, Egypt, Israel, Syria, Ukraine and now back in Iraq that we were told three years ago was secure and al Qaeda was on the run and we see the enemy that we are having to deal with."" Perry, who is considering a bid for the Republican nomination in 2016, made the remarks at a rally for New Hampshire Republican activists. The United States on Saturay carried out another airstrike in near the strategically important Mosul Dam in Iraq, according to the Defense Department. It's the 62nd such strike in support of Kurdish forces fighting for control of the dam and the 94th of the campaign against ISIS, which began August 8 and has included daily strikes. U.S. intelligence agencies are gathering information on the locations of ISIS leadership and troops in Syria, two U.S. officials have told CNN. Separately, U.S. officials said the military has been talking about increasing airstrikes in Iraq and possibly carrying out tailored airstrikes inside Syria against ISIS targets. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey signaled the United States was gearing up for a significant change both in rhetoric and action regarding ISIS in Syria. ""Can [ISIS] be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no,"" Dempsey told reporters Thursday. ""That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border. And that will come when we have a coalition in the region that takes on the task of defeating ISIS over time."" Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst who has researched terror groups for decades, said it will be difficult to defeat ISIS without ground forces. 'What does day two look like?' But American's gloomy feelings of war fatigue will make consensus building for action in Syria a difficult sell. ""President Obama has been very reluctant to get involved in Syria because what does day two look like?"" Bergen said. ""Two of the most effective fighting forces in Syria are al Qaeda or al Qaeda splinter groups, or groups like Hezbollah, backed by Iran. So if you intervene, you may be helping Iran and Hezbollah and [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's] regime."" Royce told CNN, however, that there are groups in Syria with which the United States can align. ""We should be arming the Free Syrian Army,"" Royce said. ""It was the opposition to Assad. It was clear that ISIS in a vacuum would move into that position. That's what we have seen happen."" Adding another layer to the political and security calculus for the White House, intervention in Syria is more complicated than the ongoing airstrikes in Iraq due to international law, Bergen said. ""You could imagine some combination of U.S. Special Forces in small numbers, drone strikes, and airstrikes in Syria just as has been taking place in Iraq. But it's a pretty big bridge to cross,"" Bergen said. ""The Iraq government is inviting us to do these strikes in Iraq. The Syrian government certainly wouldn't be inviting us to intervene militarily in Syria. So there's a good question of international law, which after all the administration and the United States has good reasons to uphold.""","Administration considers hitting ISIS targets in Syria .
But there are political, international law questions .
And intervention could have other effects ."
"(CNN) -- World War I began a hundred years ago this summer, but for many of us it might as well be a thousand. We know it, if we know it at all, as a dimly remembered chapter in high school history, or as scenes from old black-and-white movies of soldiers hunkered in trenches doing battle with Germans in pointy helmets. It was all too real for more than 65 million men from some 30 nations who were plunged into carnage the likes of which the world had never before seen. Every one of those soldiers is dead, and the causes they fought for are lost on many of us. Yet this ""war to end all wars"" is not a remote event. In fact, World War I changed the world forever, and its effects are all around us. To begin with, it rewrote history at the grandest level: Empires fell, and new nations--Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Poland among them-- were born in the ashes. Leaders of the still-powerful French and British empires used the conflict to redraw borders in ways that set the stage for future conflicts that stretch on today, in the Middle East, for example. But there is much more. The first mass conflict among industrialized nations, World War I upended the way war was fought. The weapons it introduced -- submarines, machine guns, poison gas, grenades, tanks -- are all still part of our arsenals. And it was World War I that made airpower and strategic bombing central to the success of any future war. Trench warfare traumatized both soldiers and landscapes, and informed art and literature for years. It would reappear as a battlefield strategy in both the Korean War and in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. At home and on the battlefield, World War I put new objects and words into circulation: ""cooties"" are something no kid wants to get, but for GIs in the trenches, they were real and they were lice; and sanitary napkins developed from the handy alternative use nurses found for cellulose bandage material produced for the war. The war popularized Kleenex and tea bags and zippers. In fact, every time you admire an aircraft carrier, eat a meatless sausage, sit under a sun lamp, wear a Burberry trench coat, or set your clock ahead for daylight saving time, you are reaching back to commune with World War I. The dawn of chemical weapons . World War I's new weapons caused previously unseen and horrific kinds of injuries, and scientists raced to develop protections against them -- or to make even more lethal versions to use against the enemy. Poison gas was first used on a mass scale by the Germans in April 1915 during the second battle of Ypres, and cloths strapped over the mouth and nose were at first the only protection. Gas masks evolved quickly, though, and by the end of the war even some horses and dogs at the front had their own. The horrors of gas attacks resonate today in the reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, and, earlier, in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and the world still struggles to contain them. All told, more than 9 million died in the conflict, and 21 million were wounded, psychologically scarring a generation. Soldiers were at pains to explain this new human experience of battle to those back home. The English poet Siegfried Sassoon had this to say in 1917 about his time at the front: ""I'm back from hell/With loathsome thoughts to sell/Secrets of death to tell;/ And horrors from the abyss."" Many others had no more words: these victims of ""war exhaustion,"" (the label of shell shock became more common) had trouble speaking: they are the forefathers of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder today. Likewise the scale and type of physical injuries challenged the ingenuity of prosthesis designers, whose work to replace lost body parts would enable countless soldiers to return to productive civilian life, a process echoed today as soldiers from recent wars recover from the toll of roadside bombs. World War I also set the stage for future conflicts, by breaking down barriers between military and civilian life. While soldiers fought at the battlefront, civilian women and men built their weapons, distributed food and propaganda, and kept the home front running. Women gained new visibility in society, moving into the jobs vacated by enlisted men. They drove streetcars, smelted iron, built bombs and then, after a long day at the factory, scrounged for food for their families. Civilians working for the war effort meant that anyone could be a target: German Fokker planes attacked at the front, but Zeppelin airships bombed London and Paris. ""Total war"" made the home front a dangerous place. This war left few things unchanged in its path, even in lands that saw no fighting. Although it was mainly fought in Europe, it awakened many to the scope and diversity of the planet. ""The entire world is participating in the war!"" a French almanac exclaimed in 1917, showing its readers a map of the world divided into enemy, ally, and neutral peoples. Whether as laborers or soldiers, Europeans went to other countries, and millions of Americans, Africans and Asians came to Europe. 'Trapped in a net of woe' More than two million United States soldiers fought in Europe, and the British and French empires brought over their colonial subjects. ""We perish in the desert; you wash yourself and lie in bed,"" wrote an Indian soldier to his wife in September 1915. ""We are trapped in a net of woe; while you go free. Our life is a living death."" How did Europe arrive at this state of catastrophe? The assassination of Austrian-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, on June 28, 1914 by the Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip caused an international crisis that led in just over a month to multiple mobilizations. The Archduke, traveling in an open car, was in Sarajevo to inspect imperial armed forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were among the former Ottoman territories annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908, angering Serbian nationalists such as Princip. After the assassination, Austria-Hungary gave Serbia an ultimatum, causing Russia to intervene to protect its Serbian client state, and Germany to help its Austrian ally. And so it all began: the military obligations imposed by the system of alliances drew one power after another into combat. All parties thought the war would be a short one; none imagined the speed with which the conflict would degenerate into a series of local atrocities (the Belgians became the conflict's first group of refugees, as they fled German rape and plunder) and mass slaughter across many fronts. The habituation to violence and the acceptance of these lethal new inventions is one of World War I's most unfortunate legacies. Chemical weapons provides a case in point. Their effectiveness, as proved by the precedent of World War I, has given them a permanent place in many state arsenals, despite the paper trail of international agreements meant to ban their use. Democracies and dictatorships (France and Italy) both used them in the interwar period as agents of colonial conquest and rule, and Syria is the most recent example of their use. As we approach this 100-year anniversary, each combatant country is remembering the war in its own way. In America, the echo has been fainter, due as much to the country's late entry into the war (April 1917) as to the prominence of World War II. ""The First World War is not well understood or remembered in the United States, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said at a 2008 Veterans Day ceremony at which the last living American combatant, Frank Buckles, who died in 2011, was present. ""Yet few events have so markedly shaped the world we live in."" At war's end in 1918, America emerged from its 18 months of combat with a raft of new legislation that is still in force -- such as the Selective Service Act, which still today allows the President to draft soldiers, and the Espionage Act, used recently to charge Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden -- and with a new status as an international power. A century of debates over how and whether America should intervene in global crises would lie ahead.","Ruth Ben-Ghiat: 100 years ago this summer, World War I began. Its legacies still resonate .

"(CNN) -- Ten-year-old Noah Cordle kicked off his summer vacation by dipping his toes into the Atlantic Ocean, only to make an ancient discovery when a sharp object hit his foot. ""It felt like a crab, so I jumped backward,"" said Cordle, who was vacationing with his family in Beach Haven. But it wasn't a crab, or a mussel shell as he deduced it might be next, after seeing its black color. It was an arrowhead -- one that an area expert says dates back to the Paleoindian period, approximately 8,000 to 11,000 years ago. ""A couple of people told us they didn't think it was real,"" Noah's mother, Andrea Cordle, said of the find, which she described as being about 2Â½ inches long and black with a small fleck of orange along a ridge on its side. Andrea and her husband, Brian Cordle, turned to Greg Lattanzi, the assistant curator at the Bureau of Archaeology and Ethnography at the New Jersey State Museum. Lattanzi, who said the museum has a collection of more than 20 similar arrowheads -- more technically termed projectile points -- called Noah's find ""rare."" He said that most similar arrowheads have been excavated from archaeological sites in the northeastern United States rather than washing ashore. After examining the arrowhead under a microscope, Lattanzi said it appears to be made of Jasper and Chert stone and was probably attached to a spear and used for hunting. The Cordles, who live in Lorton, Virginia, say they plan to hold on to their treasure for a while before finding it a permanent home. ""It's really cool, but we're not collectors,"" Andrea Cordle said. ""We're going to donate it.""","Noah Cordle, 10, found an arrowhead while vacationing in New Jersey .

"(CNN) -- A Missouri-based coal company was the victim of a hoax Tuesday after activists set up a fake website saying the company would offer free, custom-branded inhalers to children. A press release supposedly from Peabody Energy said it was creating a new public health initiative ""designed to combat the stigma of asthma among American children."" Under the so-called ""Coal Cares"" initiative, the false statement said, the inhaler actuators would be given to children living within 200 miles of a coal plant, along with coupons good toward purchase of asthma medication. ""Earlier today, an activist group released a 'spoof' website claiming to be sponsored by Peabody Energy,"" the real company said in a statement. ""The site is in fact a hoax, making inaccurate claims about Peabody and coal."" A group called Coal is Killing Kids issued a claim of responsibility for the hoax, calling itself ""an environmental and public health group that aims to challenge Big Coal's expensive lobbying against sensible updates to the Clean Air Act."" The actual Peabody Energy, based in St. Louis, said in its statement, ""Peabody is proud to help hundreds of millions of people live longer and better through coal-fueled electricity. A growing collection of studies demonstrate the correlation between electricity fueled by low-cost coal and improvement in health, longevity and quality of life."" Government statistics show that coal use in the United States has more than tripled in the past several decades, while regulated emissions have declined 84%, the company said. ""Peabody Energy is a global leader in clean coal solutions and is advancing more than a dozen clean coal projects around the world, leading to our ultimate goal of near-zero emissions from coal."" But Coal is Killing Kids said that Peabody Energy is ""lobbying ferociously against new pollution standards for power plants proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, standards the agency says will prevent 120,000 cases of childhood asthma each year in the United States."" A Peabody Energy spokeswoman did not immediately return a call or an e-mail from CNN. The hoax press release said children could choose from a variety of youth-themed inhaler cases, ""from tween faves like 'the Bieber' and 'My Little Pony,' to the 'Emo' and 'Diamond' inhalers for older, style-conscious youth. There's even 'My First Inhaler' for tots."" The hoax statement included a ""quote"" from real-life Peabody Energy Chairman and CEO Gregory Boyce, saying, ""Our actions are guided by a single mission: to be a leading worldwide producer and supplier of balanced energy solutions, which power economic prosperity and well-being. Coal Cares brings this mission to life, empowering children everywhere to take control of their destinies, beginning with their own lungs."" The fake statement pointed readers to the ""Coal Cares"" website. ""We at Peabody want to make asthma-related bullying a thing of the past,"" says the site's Frequently Asked Questions section. ""... Kids should never be ashamed of having asthma -- after all, many of their classmates likely have it as well."" ""Coal is a $7 billion per year industry, producing more than half of all U.S. electricity,"" the site says. ""We know we can't do this without you, the consumer, and especially without your children, who will continue consuming coal long after you're gone. We depend on your children's mental well-being and goodwill."" The site also offers a kids' section, where a word-search puzzle features words like ""sickness,"" ""propaganda"" and ""lies."" The phony press release listed a contact name and number at the bottom. Callers to the number reached a recording identifying it as the ""communications and investor relations department."" Coal is Killing Kids said in its statement that it worked with the Yes Lab, a project of The Yes Men. The Yes Men says on its website it aims to impersonate ""big-time criminals in order to publicly humiliate them. Our targets are leaders and big corporations who put profits ahead of everything else."" Asked whether the group is concerned about potential consequences, Janet Bellamy, a spokeswoman for Coal is Killing Kids, told CNN on Tuesday, ""We're really not. Most companies just leave it alone. They're just worried about their public image, and they don't want to look like the bad guys."" She said the attention surrounding the hoax has been ""quite interesting."" ""We're very passionate, just because we know there are millions of people out there with sick kids, and we know the coal companies are getting away with this and they want families to pay the price,"" Bellamy said. In the Coal is Killing Kids statement, Bellamy said, ""People may laugh at our sick jokes, but they also understand the real health impacts of burning coal. That's exactly what the coal industry doesn't want people to think about, because if enough of us were aware of it, we would shut down these plants once and for all."" Tuesday's hoax statement was posted on the spoof Coal Cares website and appeared to have been distributed by PR Newswire. But ""PR Newswire did not issue the hoax release,"" said PR Newswire spokeswoman Rachel Meranus in an e-mail to CNN. ""It appears that whoever is behind setting up the spoof website also posted that hoax release on the site and added PR Newswire's name to the release."" In this digital age, such hoaxes are becoming more common, said Kelly McBride, senior faculty for ethics at the Poynter Institute, an independent school with a focus on educating journalists. ""A fake press release is actually a fairly unsophisticated way of getting out information,"" she said.

"Washington (CNN) -- There's a fight brewing and it could get ugly. In one corner is the Republican Party. And in the other ... the Republican Party. The stakes could not be higher. The GOP has failed to get a majority of Americans to vote for its presidential candidates in five of the last six elections. And Tuesday night's gubernatorial races -- a win in New Jersey and loss in Virginia -- sent confusing signals, at best, about where the party is headed. 5 things we learned from Election Night 2013 . The fight spilled out into the open in a race for Alabama's 1st Congressional District, with two Republicans the face of the party's internal civil war. Establishment-backed Bradley Byrne beat tea party candidate Dean Young in Tuesday's bitter primary. The Alabama race could be just a sample of what may come, and the battle within the GOP may get much more intense leading up to the 2014 elections. That's because some Republicans -- especially what's left of the moderate wing -- don't want a repeat of the 2010 and 2012 elections. The GOP first regained control of the House of Representatives in 2010 and maintained its control two years later. Confused? Let's explain. 2010 was the year of the Republican . In 2010, Republicans gained 63 seats in the House. They saw a fighting chance at stopping President Barack Obama's expansive health care law and opposing government spending. But tension started to rise within the party. Many lawmakers were aligned with the burgeoning, ultra-conservative tea party movement. And in the years since -- particularly after the federal government's recent shutdown -- those newcomers' influence has frustrated and threatened the GOP's more traditional wing. Even more worrisome than a fight over ideas is that the split has led to real Election Day losses. So now the moderate wing has decided to fight back. 'No moderate counterbalance' ""There's sort of an inquisition going on,"" former Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio said of the tea party's efforts. And he's leading the charge against it. ""There is no moderate counterbalance ... on the money side,"" LaTourette, who retired from Congress in 2012 after frustration with partisanship and party infighting, told CNN in a recent interview. ""We've been slow to the dance."" Now he vows to fight with campaign dollars, dropping the 11th commandment Reagan made famous about Republicans not speaking ill of other Republicans. As head of the Main Street Partnership, LaTourette is using his group's campaign arm to fight some well-financed organizations such as Club for Growth and FreedomWorks that finance campaigns of ultra-conservative Republican candidates. LaTourette's goal is to raise up to $10 million to support as many as 10 Republican incumbents in the 2014 elections. That's a big lift compared with the previous election when Main Street Partnership, formerly the Republican Main Street Partnership, raised a little more than $1 million. The return of Sarah Palin . Not alone . LaTourette is not the only one who has decided to take this route. The business community, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and even an official arm of the Republican Party have also decided to get involved. Big business usually stands back and waits until a general election to flex its financial muscle. But it sent a strong signal recently by donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to Byrne in his Alabama congressional race. It was a rare move and a lot of money for such a primary. And the National Republican Senate Committee ""reserves the right"" to get involved in primaries ""if we ever thought it was necessary to win,"" Brad Dayspring, the committee's communications director, said. In defense of 'RINOs' LaTourette said the effort is to make the government run better, especially as scorecards and vote watchers keep track of every move Republicans make in Congress. Too often, LaTourette said, Republicans are backed into positions to avoid being called a RINO -- Republican in Name Only -- and getting pummeled by fellow Republicans on the campaign trail. ""I suspect the 87 Republicans who cast the right vote to reopen the government are not going to be called traitors,"" LaTourette said, referring to the recent 16-day partial government shutdown over Obamacare. LaTourette promises to support those ""traitors"" financially -- or at least a few of them. Election Night 2013: Christie wins easily; Virginia provides drama . He hosted a fund-raiser Tuesday night in New York, unveiling a new Web ad in which the narrator says, ""The time to act is now. Help us fight to protect Main Street. ..."" The ad plays controversial statements from some of the most fiery Republicans, including one-time Senate candidates Todd Akin of Missouri, Richard Mourdock of Indiana and Christine O'Donnell of Delaware. The spot reminds donors that these candidates all have one thing in common: They lost to a Democrat. Taking a shot at the birther movement, LaTourette said the only question he asks of potential candidates is ""if Barack Obama was born in the United States. And if they say yes, then we'll help them."" One candidate LaTourette knows he's going to help is Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. The House veteran and chairman of an appropriations subcommittee faces a challenge from Bryan Smith, one of three candidates Club for Growth has already endorsed. ""If Smith defeats Simpson, a favorite of the Republican leadership and a member of the Appropriations Committee, it will send a shiver down the spine of the party establishment,"" Club for Growth said about Smith's candidacy on its website. Targeted for defeat . Club for Growth has tried to defeat a cadre of Republicans considered too squishy for the party brand. In 2012, it spent more than $600,000 in the Republican primary of Arizona's 4th Congressional District against incumbent Paul Gosar, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. Gosar has a 77% rating on the Club for Growth's issues scorecard, but the group backed an even more conservative challenger -- Arizona state Sen. Ron Gould. However, Gosar ultimately won the primary and went on to win in November. Another GOP senator facing primary challenge . In all, Club for Growth spent $18 million in 2012, the Center for Responsive Politics says. Nearly $10 million was spent to defeat other Republicans. Mourdock was one of its candidates. He beat longtime Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana in the primary but ended up losing to Democrat Joe Donnelly in the general election. ""I refer to them as the Club for Democratic Growth,"" LaTourette said about the group and its efforts. Incumbent Wayne Gilchrest was another Republican defeated in a primary challenge. A moderate, he lost to Andy Harris, a Club for Growth-backed and financed candidate in the 2008 primary for Maryland's 1st Congressional District. ""Some very thoughtful, deep-thinking smart people have been voted out"" because they didn't completely align with tea party credentials, Gilchrest told CNN. Gilchrest said he can't afford to back LaTourette's effort financially, but he ""supports the idea 100%."" Financial drain . LaTourette said the aggressive tactics used against Republicans means the party's candidates have to spend large amounts of money against each other, making it more difficult to have enough cash to beat Democrats in general elections. That issue doesn't seem to faze Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller. ""We care only about passing pro-growth policies, and we don't care about what some lobbyist thinks about us,"" he said, referring to LaTourette. ""Come on in. The water's warm,"" Keller said. CNN poll: GOP and tea party unfavorables at all-time highs . GOP strategist John Feehery said the Republican Party is in a phase where it is taking ""two steps back"" before it can move forward. ""This is the biggest problem: Internal fights are wasting money,"" he said. And a lot more money is likely to be spent in this civil war.","Moderates are moving to battle tea party conservatives for the soul of the GOP .

"Hoylake, England (CNN) -- You can tell when Tiger Woods is stalking a major championship. The air gets thicker, the galleries larger and the bristle of excitement notably louder. Especially in this part of the world, because Liverpool's love affair with Woods clearly hasn't slowed in the eight years since he last walked the fairways at Hoylake and claimed the 2006 British Open title. But that exuberance might have frayed the edges of Tiger's love for Liverpool, such was the determination of some of the thousands of fans who followed him around Thursday to capture a memento. ""There were a lot of cameras out there and we were backing off a lot of shots,"" the 14-time major champion told reporters after his opening round of three-under-par 69, a further three behind clubhouse leader Rory McIlroy. ""It was tough. Unfortunately people just don't put their phones on silent and some of the professional guys were getting on the trigger a little early. ""I've had numerous years of dealing with this. You've just got to stay focused out there."" It might have been Woods' first major for nearly a year, injuries taking their toll on his 38-year-old body, but the surroundings were at least familiar. Victory here was his first since the passing of his father. After tapping in on the 18th green, the then world No. 1 collapsed into tears. Perhaps that is the reason Hoylake holds him in such affection, given it was a rare occasion when one of sport's great stonewallers turned on the waterworks. ""I was here that day when Tiger won and then broke down,"" says Nick Smith, a native of Liverpool and one of many who tailed Woods for the entirety of his round on Thursday. ""We celebrated with him and cried with him."" The landscape is different eight years on -- Tiger's walk isn't quite so tall. His last major title came barely 18 months after success at Hoylake, and the following years have been a litany of near misses, injuries and one off-course maelstrom of his own making. But the fascination for him remains undimmed, illustrated by the thousands that roared him off the first tee just after 9 a.m. on a still and sunny Wirral day. While he still commands huge crowds, there seems a tangible shift in mood; that people have come to see the man who once ruled supreme, rather than someone who can hit those heights again. There was still the odd unwitting sheep among a devout flock. One man who asked ""Who is this?"" as Tiger strolled down the first fairway was met with a rather stinging response: ""There's 5,000 people following him, who do you think it is?!"" Though Woods' gait might not have been entirely recognizable to all, the quality of his golf during Thursday's fledgling stages was in keeping with recent disappointments. Two dropped shots on the first two holes elicited groans from the gallery, one man remarking to no-one in particular: ""There's always next year, Tiger."" As the world No. 7 reached the fourth green, faces pressed against the windows of a double-decker bus crawling past on the main road that flanks the eastern part of the course. A par there seemed to lift Woods, who birdied the next to energetic applause. Chances came and went, one missed birdie putt on the 10th prompting a sigh as another patron opined: ""He used to rattle those in for fun."" Woods needed a spark from somewhere, and he got it on the back nine. A birdie from off the green at the 11th saw the first release of that famous Woods fist-pump, amid cheers from those who'd scrambled up grassy banks to net a glimpse. It isn't just spectators who stick to Woods on his way around the course. After a fine shot on the par-four 12th, which would yield another birdie, Woods strode over the brow of the hill with a cavalcade of cameramen, photographers and reporters in tow. Perhaps this is why he can appear emotionless and steely while walking the links -- it's simply his method of blocking out the circus that follows his every move. A expertly-struck shot on 13 carved a path through the steadily building wind thrown up from the River Dee and set up another opportunity. The bellow that communicated its success underscored the joy those present felt at capturing their own slice of Woods magic firsthand. A wayward approach to the 14th resulted in a dropped shot, reclaimed immediately at 15. And by the time a delicate chip on the 16th tiptoed towards the hole and offered a tap-in for birdie, Woods had made a blitz of five in six holes. Pars followed on 17 and 18, when he was clearly irritated again by an eager photographer's trigger finger, but his final tally of three-under was more than had looked likely after that inauspicious beginning. ""I didn't get off to the best of starts but I turned it round,"" he said. ""The forecast the next few days is supposed to be iffy -- guys aren't going to go over and above. ""There's a ton of players between two and four under par and that is the way I think this championship is going to unfold."" One brave journalist ventured that it had felt like ""old times"" as the American went on his run of five birdies in six, a statement that was met with a roll of the eyes and the reply: ""It wasn't that long ago."" But the signs are promising. Not only did Woods turn things around, he also reported feeling fitter each day after the back surgery that sidelined him for four months. ""I'm getting stronger, I'm getting faster, I'm getting more explosive and the ball is starting to travel again -- those are all positive things,"" he added. ""It felt good to be out there competing again."" With that Woods left a crowded press tent and made a beeline for the practice range. ""I thought he'd be taller than that,"" a punter said as Woods bustled past. Give it a few days and he just might be.","Tiger Woods returns to the scene of his last British Open success .

"(CNN) -- In the heart of Northern California's wine country, piles of stemware lay shattered on the ground. Building facades in historic downtown Napa crumbled into the streets. And residents who enjoyed decades of calm received a harsh reminder that intense quakes can strike anytime. ""I was in shock to see people's homes and offices on the floor,"" Napa resident Elise Martinez said. ""This is life-changing."" But even as the Bay Area tries to clean up from its strongest earthquake in 25 years, the tremor could have been much worse. No one was killed in the 6.0-magnitude earthquake that jostled residents awake early Sunday. The Queen of the Valley Medical Center said it has treated ""approximately 208"" patients since the earthquake struck. Of those, 17 were admitted to the hospital, and one is still in critical condition. The majority of patients sustained injuries that were not life-threatening. But the hospital has not seen any patients related to the earthquake since 11 p.m. PT Sunday. Although 70,000 customers lost power after the quake, power was restored for all customers Monday afternoon, according Pacific Gas and Electric. 'We need more help' Still, the recovery will be daunting. ""Everything and everyone in Napa was affected by the quake,"" said CNN iReporter Malissa Koven. ""My house, along with everybody else's, is a disaster. It looks like somebody broke in and ravaged the place, room by room."" Napa City Manager Mike Parness said the damage is beyond what the city can handle. ""We have exhausted our local resources,"" he said. ""We need more help from the outside."" California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency. The earthquake triggered six major fires that destroyed several mobile homes, Napa Division Fire Chief John Callanan said. Safety measures are still in effect for dozens of buildings across the city. Upwards of 200 commercial and noncommercial structures have been marked by yellow tags, meaning ""property owners can go into the building to clean up but have been advised not to occupy until further notice,"" said Rick Tooker, Napa community development director at a news conference Monday evening. ""Seventy commercial and noncommercial structures have been red-tagged and cannot be occupied,"" added Tooker. And it could take up to a week to get the water system back to normal after dozens of reported water-main breaks, Napa Public Works Director Jack Rochelle said. But he said running water is safe to drink. More aftershocks expected . About 50 to 60 aftershocks rattled the area in the hours after the quake, said John Parrish, chief of the California Geological Survey. The strongest had a magnitude of 3.6. ""We do think the aftershocks will continue for several weeks,"" Parrish said. The quake was the strongest to hit the Bay Area since 1989, when a 6.9-magnitude temblor struck during the World Series. The Loma Prieta earthquake caused 63 deaths, 3,757 injuries and an estimated $6 billion in property damage, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The damage from Sunday's earthquake was relatively minor compared with the buckled highways and destroyed homes 25 years ago. But some said Sunday's quake seemed more intense. ""Honestly, it felt much worse than the '89 earthquake,"" CNN iReporter Garret Gauer said. ""The refrigerator relocated itself to the other side of the kitchen."" One child hurt when a fireplace collapsed was airlifted to UC Davis Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Vanessa deGier said. Nearly 160 people were treated for minor injuries at the emergency room at Queen of the Valley Hospital, though hospital CEO Walt Mickens could not confirm that all of those patients were injured in the earthquake. How did it feel? Sunday's earthquake was centered 6 miles southwest of Napa and 9 miles southeast of Sonoma, according to the USGS. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated based on their locations that 15,000 people experienced severe shaking, and 106,000 people felt very strong shaking. The quake struck about 7 miles deep and was considered ""strong"" by the Geological Survey. Major quakes start at a 7.0 magnitude, according to the agency's scale. The economic loss will probably top $1 billion, according to USGS data. At Silver Oak Winery, owner David Duncan tried to clean up hundreds of broken wine bottles that tumbled off the shelves. ""Those bottles were very unique,"" he said. They were part of his private collection and worth hundreds of dollars. California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom stressed that it's not just the wine country that needs help. ""There's a mythology about Napa, that it's all fancy wineries,"" Newsom said. ""But underneath that there are a lot of folks here -- very low income -- that are going to need support."" Follow the story in a CNN Storify. Did you feel it?

"(CNN) -- Child witchcraft allegations are increasing in parts of Africa, as thousands of children have been attacked, beaten or killed, according to a new report. The accused children are mostly boys, ages 8 to 14 -- with orphans, street children, albinos, and disabled as the most at risk, said the United Nations Children's Fund in its report. The accused children often suffer from extreme physical or psychological violence as a result of being branded a ""child witch,"" the report said. Exorcisms that include pouring petrol into children's eyes or ears, and forcing them to swallow various substances have been reported by researchers as ways to ""cleanse"" the accused. The agency cites urbanization, poverty, conflict and the growing economic burden of raising children as some of the factors that contribute to the recent increase in accusations against already vulnerable children. Countries with the highest prevalence of child witchcraft accusations are: Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Nigeria, the report said. The issue of child witches is a relatively recent phenomenon that dates back 10 to 20 years. Researchers say before this, women and the elderly were the ones most often accused.","Thousands of children have been beaten or killed, UNICEF says .

"(CNN) -- In Lebanon's picturesque Bekaa Valley, life moves at a gentle pace. Tractors trundle along narrow country roads while sleepy vineyards blossom beneath the pleasant glare of the mid-afternoon sun. It's here, amidst this green and fertile hinterland, that the roots of Lebanon's modern wine making industry have borne fruit. But conflict across the wider Middle East region has disrupted this idyllic country scene in recent years. According to Charles Ghostine, managing director of local winemaker Chateau Ksara, tourists have been put off from traveling the Bekaa Valley because of the violence unfolding nearby. Visitors from neighboring Syria were once among Ksara's best customers, he says, but that's changed dramatically since that country's devastating civil war began three years ago. ""We used to have 70,000 visitors per year,"" Ghostine says. ""The Europeans and the Americans and Japanese used to come to Syria and then to visit Lebanon."" ""It (also) affected us because we used to export 300,000 bottles to Syria per year. Now we're exporting around 50,000 only."" Ksara has been forced to look towards new markets to make up for this shortfall. Along with Lebanon's other wine makers they are rallying to promote their goods and produce collectively. ""When we go to international fairs, we go under a Lebanese pavilion,"" says Ghostine. ""Before every participant used to go and to have his own booth."" Ghostine explains that the group is looking to sell the story and history of Lebanon and not just its wines. He points to a group of ancient cellars discovered beneath land owned by Ksara in 1898 as an example of Lebanon's rich wine producing past. ""There are a million bottles of wine, stored in these cellars that date back to the Roman era,"" he says. ""Walls of wine, steeped in history."" Winemaking dates back thousands of years in Lebanon but modern day production really didn't start until the 20th century. According to wine writer Michael Karam, this puts Lebanon behind other wine-producing nations in terms of marketing its global reputation. ""We [Lebanon] produce eight million bottles of wine a year which may sound like a lot but if we compare that to Turkey, which produces 70 million, Cypriots around 35 to 40 million. Israelis produce about 50 million -- so even on a regional scale we're tiny. Global scale? We're a dot."" ""I mean Italy the biggest producer in the world probably produces on average around four billion bottles a year."" But bigger isn't always better. The rarity of Lebanese wine is a distinguishing factor that businesses can capitalize on to help their product stand out, Karam believes. ""The message they should be sending consumers is we only make eight million bottles a year,"" he says. ""Come and get them while you can."" ""There's no reason why Lebanese wine cannot be the sexiest wine on the planet."" To that end, it's not just the large-scale wineries capping every bottle with a personal touch. Smaller family-run wine businesses like Domaine Des Tourelles are getting in on the act as well. ""The message behind this winery is to produce quality wines, products from this land made by people working in this land,"" says company co-owner, Fawzi Issa. Domaine Des Tourelles produces a not inconsiderable 250,000 bottles of wine each year. But the company's specialty remains arak, a Lebanese spirit made from aniseed. ""We're a leader now in the local market for the arak,"" says Issa. ""(Our arak product is sold) in around 15 to 17 countries, a bit everywhere where the Lebanese people are."" With the arak market well-tapped, Issa says he wants to expand the company's wine business to achieve his ultimate dream. ""My target is more ... global. To show Lebanon everywhere, to have Lebanese wine in the list of each and every restaurant in the whole world."" Issa is acutely aware, however, that Lebanon still has to overcome negative images abroad. The country remains divided along religious lines and a number of suicide-bomb attacks have rocked the country this year. Ghostine says he couldn't agree more with Issa's sentiment. ""The message that we want to forward to the world is that Lebanon is not an exporter of terrorism, Lebanon is an exporter of culture and good wines,"" Ghostine says. Getting out and showing the very best of what his country has to offer is a key method of doing just that.","Wine has been produced in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley for thousands of years .

"(CNN)  -- The human rights group Amnesty International is calling on Nigeria to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir if he attends an African Union Summit there on Thursday. Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to a five-year campaign of violence in western Sudan's Darfur region. And Nigeria, as party to the treaty that created the criminal court, is obliged to cooperate, Amnesty said. Nigerian officials could not immediately be reached for comment. ""The Nigerian government has an unconditional legal obligation to arrest President Omar al-Bashir and hand him over to the ICC, should he enter Nigerian territory,"" the group said. ""Any failure to fulfill obligations under international law and may amount to obstruction of justice."" The group said Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua invited al-Bashir to attend the African Union Peace and Security Council in the capital, Abuja. The International Criminal Court issued the warrant against al-Bashir in March. It was the first ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. The warrant covers five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. Al-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. Sudan denies the death toll is that high. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. Eighteen heads of state are slated to attend the summit, at which ex-South African President Thabo Mbeki is expected to submit a report on the situation in Darfur.","Al-Bashir is wanted by ICC on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity .

"OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- Terrie Light stands outside Oakland's stunning new modern cathedral in a first-of-its-kind garden that honors victims of clergy sexual abuse. She was abused by a priest at age 7. For the first time, the Catholic Church has offered a garden that honors victims of clergy sex abuse. ""It's a really small, important physical representation of a horrific thing that happened in many places,"" she told CNN. She says the garden's centerpiece, a symbolic low stone sculpture that's broken, is fitting for those whose lives were shattered by priests. ""The energy that the artist put was this circular stone trying to pull itself to become unbroken. That is our journey. That is what we try to do every day -- is to try to be unbroken."" The garden is placed near a wall of the Cathedral of Christ the Light, which was consecrated September 25. Two low-curved benches bracket the sculpture, one facing toward the cathedral, the other facing away. The benches are surrounded by hedges.  Watch the bishop of Oakland apologize to victims » . The bench placement is deliberate and takes into account the feelings and needs of abuse victims.Those who choose not to face the cathedral end up facing a small lake across the street. Father Paul Minnihan, the provost of the cathedral, says it was important to have the garden -- for the victims, and for the church to atone for the sins of its past. ""Part of the church's mission is to make sure we bring healing to people who are in need of it, even if we were the cause of it,"" he says. ""Having this garden on the campus says we are serious about our desire to help in your healing process on whatever level. As this cathedral will be around for 500 years, so will that garden as a place of healing and hope."" The Catholic Church was rocked earlier this decade by allegations of children being sexually abused by priests, with scores of victims filing lawsuits against their alleged abusers. The church was accused of covering up the abuse for decades by sending offending priests to other parishes. The church wound up paying hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements. Some priests went to jail; others resigned. Pope Benedict XVI in July apologized to victims and called the abuse ""evil."" At the garden's dedication on October 11, Allen Vigneron, bishop of Oakland, once again offered the church's apology. ""To the hurts of so many innocents, we preferred the darkness to the light. And for that, I again make heartfelt apologies to all victim survivors. As it says on the plaques at the entries, 'We remember and we affirm: never again.'"" Terrie Light, who has been a vocal advocate for abuse victims for many years, says getting the garden built was not an easy process. ""We got silence, then we got passed around,"" she says. She said Barbara Flannery, the former chancellor of the diocese who became the church's point person on helping victims, advocated for the garden to the bishop. ""He thought it was a good idea. But it's different from 'It's a good idea' to 'Here's the people to meet with to make it happen,'"" she says. ""When we finally met with the architect, things really changed."" ""He really understood what we were trying to accomplish and put together some architects to create this garden that he thought would give us what we wanted for a place for people to come and connect to their spirituality not inside the church."" Why outside? ""There are people that want to go into a church that cannot. It's too painful, too emotionally traumatizing,"" she says. ""There are other people that are ambivalent -- that want to be there and not want to be there. This gives them the option."" The garden is not what survivors had originally envisioned -- a lush, English garden with flowers and trees. But they are pleased with the outcome. ""It's a very simple space,"" Light says. Most victims of abuse in the Oakland area favored the garden; a few opposed it, feeling that it implied closure to a problem that still exists. Minnihan says the church has sought ""to bring back healing and wholeness and work with those who are survivors"" since the scandal. The garden is emblematic of that. ""We wanted to have a place respectful for their needs and their wishes,"" he says.","Garden at Oakland's new cathedral provides relief to victims of church sex abuse .

"Orlando (CNN) -- First, it was a record-breaking book series, selling more than 450 million copies worldwide. Then, it became the most successful movie franchise in history. Now, it is a theme-park phenomenon that has fans in a frenzy. Diagon Alley, a second area of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, opens July 8 at Universal Studios Florida. Guests will be immersed in the new Potter paradise, which spans about 20 acres and includes a high-tech ride, the Leaky Cauldron restaurant, a handful of elaborate shops and stage shows, and the Hogwarts Express train between Diagon Alley and the separate Hogsmeade area in the adjacent Islands of Adventure park. ""Universal smartly involved (""Harry Potter"" series author J.K. Rowling) and the production designers from the Harry Potter films in every step of the design process,"" said Robert Niles, editor of themeparkinsider.com. This means nearly every detail, down to the cobblestone streets and the Hogwarts Express, is just as it was in the films. The marquee ride Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts puts guests smack dab in the middle of the recognizable grand bank lobby filled with hardworking animatronic goblins, some counting money, others jotting down bank records. Turn the corner and head down the hallway, and you realize you're in Bill Weasley's office. Then, board souped-up elevators that make you feel as if you are going deep into the cavernous vaults. Finally, hop into a 12-person vehicle that takes you into Gringotts Bank. It's part roller coaster, part 3-D motion-based ride. The other attraction, the Hogwarts Express, where Harry meets pals Hermione and Ron in the first movie, is equally detailed. It takes about four minutes to shuttle people back and forth between Hogsmeade (in Islands of Adventure) and Diagon Alley (in Universal Studios). Once on board, guests step into train carriages. As the doors shut, the 3-D video screens show images of Hagrid on a flying motorcycle, the Weasley twins on their brooms and the Knight Bus in London. But keep an eye on the doorway, where shadows of Dementors, Harry, Ron and Hermione make guests feel like they are in a scene from the movies. The themed land also includes a number of shops frequented by the young wizards in the movies, such as Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes, which sells unusual items like Skiving Snackboxes that come with Fainting Fancies, Nosebleed Nougats, Fever Fudge and Puking Pastilles. (In the movies, wizards use these to make themselves appear ill. In real life, they are sweet treats.) Inside Wiseacres, you'll find armillary spheres ($179.95), which wizards use in astronomy class, and in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, there are loads of Hogwarts ties and robes, quaffles and brooms ranging from $34.95 to $300. The Leaky Cauldron has a menu featuring British classics like toad in the hole (sausage baked in a flour-egg batter, $8.99), fish and chips, and bangers and mash. Plus, there are draught beers brewed specifically for Diagon Alley, including Wizard's Brew and Dragon's Scale, and non-alcoholic drinks like Fishy Green Ale and Tongue Tying Lemon Squash. Perhaps the most talked-about food item is butterbeer ice cream, served at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour. There are live shows throughout the day. ""The Tales of Beedle the Bard"" features a troupe of four from the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts. The lively performers retell two of the famed tales of Beedle the Bard, a 15th-century author of wizarding fairy tales. The other show is a lively musical performance featured in the Potter movies. The boy with the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead is ingrained in pop culture. So, it comes as no surprise that Universal continues to invest in the franchise. ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter-Hogsmeade (which opened in 2010) has been one of the most successful attractions in the history of themed entertainment, in terms of attendance numbers, Universal's bottom line and the impact it has had on the rest of the industry,"" said Andy Brennan, industry analyst with IBISWorld. Likewise, expanding the Wizarding World by creating Diagon Alley at Universal Studios, which Brennan says has cost about $400 million to construct, was a no-brainer. ""Hogsmeade reportedly cost over $250 million,"" he added, ""so this is NBCUniversal's most significant investment to date."" Plus, ""combined attendance at Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios has jumped more than 50% since 2009,"" Brennan said. ""NBCUniversal's theme park revenue is up nearly 40% since 2009, much of which can be directly attributed to the popular WWHP."" Diagon Alley will certainly lure park-goers to Orlando, which is experiencing one of the most significant expansion periods in the destination's history. According to Visit Orlando, there were 59 million visitors in 2013, up 27% from 46.6 million in 2009. If you go: . Admission into Universal Studios Florida ($96 for adults and $90 for kids ages 3 to 9) allows you to roam around the park and visit Diagon Alley. However, if you'd like to pop over to Hogsmeade (at Universal's Islands of Adventure) via the Hogwarts Express, you must purchase park-to-park admission ($136 for adults, $130 for kids ages 3 to 9).","Diagon Alley at Universal Studios Florida expands the Wizarding World of Harry Potter .

"(CNN) -- Bodies torn apart by the weapons of war. The bloody corpse of a man hit by shelling as he walked under trees, a shopkeeper's mutilated body in front of her store, a broom lying nearby. Some three months after pro-Russian rebels declared an independent ""Donetsk People's Republic,"" Ukrainian government forces are encircling the city of Donetsk. Photojournalist Jonathan Alpeyrie was in the city in May and returned two weeks ago to find it battle-scarred and slowly draining of life as its people flee. The images he has captured show the anguish of the immediate aftermath of shelling -- the relatives of victims, people left homeless, the dead. Others depict those left behind sheltering in Soviet or WWII-era cellars and boarded-up buildings as their homes are engulfed by the conflict. The photographs, many too graphic to show here, leave no doubt about the true horror of the destructive conflict. ""If you go north of the city towards the airport you have entire areas that are no-man's land -- they are not controlled by anybody and they are being shelled daily ... with mortars and tanks,"" Alpeyrie tells CNN. ""You see some families that have remained there -- mostly elders and a lot of people that don't really have any money, they have to stay. You also get people who stay because they don't want to leave their homes. It's been their family home for a long time and they have their belongings inside, so they want to stay close to that. ""You do have a lot of elders who are pretty tough and they're very pro-Russian, so for them that's also their struggle but a lot of them are hoping that this will end quickly."" The center of Donetsk, in peacetime much like any other modern city, is less damaged, though suffering from water shortages and largely shut down, he says, abandoned by an estimated half of Donetsk's population of around one million. ""People do get killed. If you're walking down the street it's like a lottery, you just don't know,"" Alpeyrie says. The day before Alpeyrie spoke to CNN, the group he was with -- fellow photographers and a local driver/translator -- had almost been killed in the town of Marynivka. Four people died nearby. ""It's always hard when we see people getting killed where you are, that's tough, because they're just regular people and they're not really involved in the war,"" he says. The team's driver was one of the residents trying to earn a living while it was still possible. Many of those still facing the dangers of Donetsk have sent their children away, Alpeyrie says. The trains have stopped running from Donetsk, so the refugees travel by bus, many making the perilous journey through fighting in Luhansk region to reach Russia. Others go south to Mariupol, traveling through the conflict's front line to safety, Alpeyrie says. There, where the fighting is at its most intense, photography is not welcomed by the rebels. ""You can hang out with them if you want, but since just they get hit all the time and as you can't take pictures or photos there's no reason to hang out with them,"" Alpeyrie says. However, recently Alpeyrie and some colleagues got lucky -- obtaining rare images of a rebel funeral.

"(CNN) -- ""Breaking Bad,"" it's time for your curtain call. The addictive AMC series, which concluded last September, is expected to be one of the major frontrunners when the nominations are announced Thursday for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards. Its final half-season, which earned both big ratings and critical plaudits, is just about guaranteed to earn the show another nomination for best drama -- and that's only the start. Star Bryan Cranston, who already has four Emmy wins for the show, should easily nab another nod. Co-star Aaron Paul should get one as well. Altogether, the drama that turned ""Mr. Chips into Scarface,"" in the description of creator Vince Gilligan, should make out quite well. ""Remember my name,"" indeed. But it may face some stiff competition, especially since both the drama and comedy series categories have been expanded up to seven nominees this year. Here are some other Emmy storylines to pay attention to: . 1. ""True Detective"" is on the case. The praise for the ""Breaking Bad"" finale had barely started to die down when HBO's ""True Detective"" zipped into the zeitgeist. The first season, which starred Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as two Louisiana homicide detectives -- one of them given to existential flights of fancy about life, the universe and nothingness -- may have actually helped win McConaughey an Oscar. Emmy voters have no doubt paid attention. 2. The return of Netflix. If last year's eight nominations for ""House of Cards"" weren't enough, this year will likely bring more honors for the Washington-set drama and its Machiavellian characters. Moreover, the first season of ""Orange Is the New Black"" -- which narrowly missed qualifying for last year's Emmys -- is probably going to be in the thick of the comedy races, along with ""Louie,"" ""Veep,"" ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""Modern Family."" (""Orange's"" second season, which was released on June 6, will qualify for next year's awards.) 3. Room for the offbeat. HBO's ""Silicon Valley"" might not be able to find a slot among the comedy series nominees, since there are more than enough viable candidates. But the late actor Christopher Evan Welch, who played the eccentric investor Peter Gregory in the show, might earn a nomination for his standout supporting work (if that's not an oxymoron). Similarly, Fox's ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" had an up-and-down season, with its surprise Golden Globe win contrasting with mediocre ratings and uneven scripts. That may not be enough to get it a best comedy series nomination. But the show does benefit from some great supporting characters, including Andre Braugher as Capt. Ray Holt and Chelsea Peretti as Gina Linetti, aka ""the Paris of people."" 4. Remember ""Orphan Black""! Last year the Outrage Machine (commonly known as ""the Internet"") was inflamed by the lack of attention paid to ""Orphan Black,"" the thrilling BBC America series that stars Tatiana Maslany as several mysterious clones. Emmy probably won't have to be prompted twice; the most recent season of ""Orphan"" got plenty of exposure and Maslany's face has been everywhere. The CNN 10: Tatiana Maslany and more fresh faces to watch in 2014 . 5. The big HBO movie. Every year HBO -- which, it should be noted, is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN -- earns a bunch of nominations for one or more of its made-for-HBO movies and miniseries. Last year it was ""Behind the Candelabra."" Previous years have showered nominations on ""Game Change,"" ""Angels in America,"" ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,"" ""Grey Gardens"" and ""John Adams."" This year, look to ""The Normal Heart,"" the film version of Larry Kramer's wrenching play about AIDS, to be among the leaders for total nominations, with stars Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts leading the way. With the movie category being separated from miniseries for the first time this year, look for shows like ""American Horror Story"" and ""Fargo"" to be recognized -- and have a shot of winning now. 6. Leading women. Even with more nominees being named this year, the race for lead actress in a drama looks to be the most competitive. This is a good thing because there are standout performances from every corner of television. Emmy favorites like Claire Danes (""Homeland""), Kerry Washington (""Scandal""), Robin Wright (""House of Cards""), Julianna Margulies (""The Good Wife"") and Elisabeth Moss (""Mad Men"") could be upset by newcomers including the aforementioned Maslany, Lizzy Caplan (""Masters of Sex""), Michelle Dockery (""Downton Abbey"") or Keri Russell (""The Americans"").

"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton challenged nations around the world Tuesday to recognize that ""gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights,"" building on an order by President Barack Obama directing all U.S. agencies to ""promote and protect"" the rights of gay people, . In an impassioned defense of such rights, Clinton called the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people ""universal"" and criticized nations that criminalize gay behavior or tolerate abuse of gay, bisexual or transgendered people . Clinton made the unusually strong speech as Obama announced a presidential directive to use U.S. foreign aid to promote rights for gays and lesbians abroad, including combating attempts by foreign governments to criminalize homosexuality and making treatment of gays a factor in awarding foreign aid. The remarks were meant to mark Human Rights Day, which is Saturday. The date commemorates the 1948 signing of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights. Speaking to the U.N. Human Rights Council, before an audience that included diplomats from Arab, African and other countries with poor records on gay rights, Clinton said religious beliefs and cultural practices are no excuse for discriminating or tolerating violence against gay people. ""No practice or tradition trumps the human rights that belong to all of us, and this holds true for inflicting violence on LGBT people,"" she said. ""It is a violation of human rights when people are beaten or killed because of their sexual orientation, or because they do not conform to cultural norms about how men and women should look or behave."" Clinton recognized America's own record on LGBT equality is ""far from perfect."" She called laws discriminating against gays or tolerating abuse against them a violation of human rights and rejected the notion espoused by some nations that ""homosexuality is a Western phenomenon and therefore people from outside the West have grounds to reject it."" ""Gay people are born into -- and belong to -- every society in the world. They are all ages, all races, all faiths. They are doctors, and teachers, farmers and bankers, soldiers and athletes,"" she said. ""Being gay is not a Western invention. It is a human reality."" The U.N. Human Rights Council has gradually been more vocal about promoting gay rights. In June the body passed a measure supporting equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation, and in March it adopted a statement, supported by 85 countries, on gay rights called ""Ending Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity."" The State Department lobbied intensively on behalf of both documents. The Obama administration, and Clinton in particular, has made gay rights a key focus of its human rights agenda. Obama repealed the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy allowing gays to serve openly in the military and, at Clinton's urging, extended medical benefits to the same-sex partners of federal employees early in his term. Gay rights have also taken on a greater role in U.S. foreign policy. Clinton aides say she regularly raises the issue in meetings with her counterparts and she has instructed embassies around the world to report on violence and discrimination against the LGBT community and challenge laws that criminalize LGBT status or conduct. The State Department has raised concerns about proposed laws in Nigeria that would criminalize conduct, as well as in Uganda, which would have in some cases applied the death penalty. Obama issued a memorandum Tuesday directing all U.S. government agencies working abroad to use foreign aid to assist gays and lesbians who are facing human rights violations and improve protections for gay and lesbian refugees and asylum seekers. The presidential order applies to all U.S. government agencies involved in foreign aid, including the departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security and Treasury, as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development. The administration will take treatment of gays into consideration when making decisions on awarding foreign aid. ""Our deep commitment to advancing the human rights of all people is strengthened when we as the United States bring our tools to bear to vigorously advance this goal,"" Obama said in the memorandum. As part of the administration's effort, Clinton announced a $3 million fund to support civil society and non-governmental organization activists working on the subject, as well as enhancing protection for refugees and asylum seekers who are being persecuted because of LGBT status. Gay rights groups praised the effort as a significant step toward protecting the rights of gays and lesbians around the world. ""Today's actions by President Obama make clear that the United States will not turn a blind eye when governments commit or allow abuses to the human rights of LGBT people,"" said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy organization.","President Obama has ordered all U.S. agencies to ""promote and protect"" gay rights .

"New York (CNN) -- Within hours of finding Philip Seymour Hoffman on the floor of his bathroom with a needle in his arm, New York Police Department investigators were combing his apartment and the surrounding neighborhood for clues. Investigators looked through video from ATM cameras and interviewed people who saw the actor, piecing together his final hours as they searched for anyone who might be linked to the drugs believed to have killed him over the weekend. Three days later, authorities arrested four people in connection with the drugs found in Hoffman's apartment. It was a lightning-paced investigation, raising the question that out of the thousands of heroin-related deaths in the United States each year, how many yield similar results? ""There are laws in most states now that say if you give drugs to somebody who kill themselves, you are responsible for their death,"" CNN legal analyst Mark O'Mara said. But are all such investigations created equal? The answer depends on whom you ask, and where you ask. 'A victim is a victim' The large law-enforcement response to Hoffman's death wasn't surprising to Mordecai Dzikansky, a retired NYPD homicide detective and intelligence officer with more than 25 years on the job. ""...That's part of the beast,"" he said. ""Something happens in Midtown versus something happens in a corner of Staten Island, I don't think the detectives on the case feel any differently. A victim is a victim."" But add the actor's stature and the media attention, and it requires a few more ""hands on deck,"" he said. Everyone in law enforcement agrees there has been a spike in heroin use in the United States, spurred by a crackdown on abuse of prescription pills and an increase in heroin production in Mexico. As a result, heroin-related deaths are on the rise. And so, too, are the investigations into the drug that serves as a cheap substitute for prescription drug abuse. Quantifying the number of heroin-related investigations is difficult at best, given the sheer number of jurisdictions across the nation. But Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD detective with more than 20 years of experience as an investigator, believes the police response in the Hoffman case was undoubtedly influenced by media attention surrounding an apparent overdose death of a celebrity. The Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment on the Hoffman case or discuss the number of heroin-related prosecutions it has carried out. The New York Police Department did not respond to repeated CNN requests to discuss the scope and pace of the Hoffman investigation compared to others in the city. Spate of deaths . Giacalone said a spate of heroin-related deaths in the region also played a role in the police response. In Allegheny County, a predominantly working class area of western Pennsylvania, the chief medical examiner says he typically sees three to four deaths a week from drug overdoses. Rarely are they heroin deaths. But in one week in late January, Dr. Karl Williams says he saw 15 -- all heroin users, all from an overdose of heroin laced with the powerful cancer painkiller fentanyl. The drug did not discriminate. Among the dead: Men and women, young and old. None was a famous actor, though. County and state law enforcement officials sounded the warning about the deadly drug, and Pittsburgh's mayor pleaded for people to come forward with information. Within days, a 39-year-old Pittsburgh man was in custody charged with selling the heroin. Authorities seized more than 2,000 bags of the suspected heroin from the man's home, state Attorney General Kathleen G. Kane said at the time. ""It is my highest priority to find and hold accountable those involved in the distribution of this deadly drug mixture,"" she said. Authorities in Maryland sounded a similar warning after 37 people died between September and January after using heroin laced with fentanyl. And in New York City, authorities have reported a dramatic jump in heroin-related deaths. From 2010 to 2012, heroin-related deaths jumped 84%, from 3.1 to 5.7 per 100,000 people, according to a New York City Health Department report released in 2013. That amounts to 382 deaths in 2012, more than one per day. ""The more attention that these things get in the media, the more likelihood there's going to be a strong police response,"" said Giacalone, who teaches criminal investigation at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. Celebrities vs. ordinary people . But the media doesn't pay close attention to an overdose death of an ordinary New Yorker, said Dzikansky, who spent years investigating drug overdoses. ""Most of the overdoses that I dealt with, I can't say all, but there was a significant amount where the person, in order to feed the habit, would burglarize apartments,"" he said. ""Here's an example of a person with a family who brought joy to many, many people and, unfortunately, his addiction killed him. Now there's more attention ... We have to get it [heroin] off the streets. Once it's off the streets, everybody benefits, even the burglar who does it to feed a habit benefits."" Hundreds of miles from New York City, Beth Vernau heard the news of Hoffman's death and the police investigation. There has been no such law enforcement response looking into her son Andrew's heroin overdose last October, she says. ""What makes his death more important than that of my 19-year-old son?"" Vernau, who lives outside Pittsburgh, asked of Hoffman's apparent drug overdose. ""(The police) get on it because it makes the news. But you have a 19-year-old who overdosed, and there could be an example made out there: We're going to go after these people. But no, because he's not a celebrity, that's the end of it."" 'Families of ordinary kids struggle' Andrew was hospitalized two days before dying from an addiction that started when he was 13, Vernau said. He started abusing alcohol and pot, then prescription drugs and, finally, heroin. She said her son overdosed and the two people he was with put him in her car and drove him around for an hour and 45 minutes before taking him to a hospital. There was no prosecution, she said, no search for the dealer who sold him the heroin. ""Don't get me wrong, I feel bad for anybody who dies of an overdose. But the families of ordinary kids struggle just as much,"" she said. Giacalone said some will unfairly criticize the rapid police response to the death of the celebrity. ""Family members of people who aren't famous will say, look at the police response because this guy was an actor, but that's not the case,"" he said. ""The answer is that people were willing to cooperate and give out information to get this stuff. Usually family members are the last ones to know. And friends abandon them, too, because they're using heroin, too."" ""It really comes down to the fact that in the very beginning of the investigation, they had people who were willing to help out the police. That rarely happens."" The day after Hoffman died the headlines in New York screamed: ""Last Act"" and ""Death By The Needle."" There were no such headlines for Jose Juarez and Yvonne Valdez, both 18, who died last November of heroin overdoses blocks apart on the same day in Irving, Texas. Authorities were looking into whether overdoses were related, according to CNN affiliate KNBC in Dallas. How did it happen? Celebrity deaths attract attention and, ultimately, questions: How did this happen? Why did it happen? Those are the questions authorities are trying to answer about Hoffman. Giacalone is hopeful some good might come out of the investigation. ""Maybe this death of this actor won't be in vain. Maybe they'll be a huge response with arrests of people putting heroin on the streets,"" he said. And just maybe all this attention on Hoffman's death will save a few lives, Aaron Sorkin, the creator of HBO's ""The Newsroom,"" wrote in Time magazine. The two men first met on the set of the 2007 film ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" and during a break in filming the two men shared their stories of heroin addiction with one another. ""If one of us dies of an overdose, probably 10 people who were about to won't,"" Hoffman told him, Sorkin wrote in Time magazine. ""He meant that our deaths would make news and maybe scare someone clean."" CNN's Ray Sanchez reported this story from New York; Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.","The investigation into the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman is raising questions .

"(CNN) -- If not for the Bible, the bullets would have gone right through his heart. A public transit bus driver in Dayton, Ohio, was attacked by three teenagers early Monday morning after his bus broke down on the side of the road, police told CNN affiliate WHIO. Rickey Wagoner, 49, was shot three times at point-blank range and stabbed in the arm, but survived because both bullets aimed at his chest were stopped by a New Testament devotional Bible in his front pocket, according to WHIO. The third bullet struck him in the leg. ""There was obviously some kind of intervention involved in this incident, because he probably should not be here,"" Dayton Police Sgt. Michael Pauley told WHIO. Wagoner told police he believes the assault was part of a gang initiation. Wagoner said he heard one suspect tell another that he needed to ""kill the polar bear"" in order to be ""all the way in the club,"" according to WHIO. Dayton police, however, said it was too early in the investigation to draw any conclusions about the motive. During the attack, Wagoner told police, he used an aluminum pen from his pocket to stab one of the teenage boys in the leg, according to WHIO. The suspects dropped the gun and fled as Wagoner picked up the weapon and opened fire. Wagoner was transported to a hospital and was being treated for a bullet wound to the leg, among other injuries, according to WHIO. His injuries are not life-threatening, police said. Police were searching for the three male suspects. The condition of the book, which police described as a religious devotional entitled ""The Message,"" was unknown.

"(CNN) -- Even before the NBA announced it was banning Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the league for life, sports fans had begun speculating about which billionaire would swoop in to buy the team. Rumors are swirling about the possible interest of ""Magic"" Johnson, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs and Oscar De La Hoya, each potential celebrity owner no doubt more popular than the incumbent. Or perhaps, it is said, a group of virtuous billionaires, the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Larry Ellison and David Geffen, will charitably unite to rescue the franchise for the City of Angels. Here instead is my modest proposal: Sell the team to the people, to thousands of fans themselves, as shareholders. Then the Clippers would be owned not by a single incredibly wealthy patron whom we might admire or might detest, but by Americans of all races, ethnicities, religions, ages and backgrounds. As a loyal fan of the Green Bay Packers (disclosure: My wife, Callista, and I own a single Packers share and our daughter Kathy and son-in-law Paul each have one, too), I have a particular attachment to this model of ownership for professional sports teams. There is something strange about the prevailing model of teams as the ultimate billionaire's toy. That's because a professional sports team often seems like a public institution. Its logo adorns every head on the street. The jerseys of its players are sold on every corner, its apparel in every airport gift store. The mayor and the governor make frequent reference to its fortunes in their public appearances. They parade in ceremoniously to throw out the first pitch or to sit in judgment on the sidelines. And the people, for their part, are outraged when the team doesn't perform well; they demand management changes as if management requires the consent of the entertained. And perhaps the people do have some claim: As taxpayers, they lavish financial assistance upon their team, pouring resources into public safety for the games and constructing the opulent stadiums their champions deserve. Because it is, after all, the people's team. It is their team -- the fans' team -- in every regard except the one that matters. At the bottom of it all, it is really the billionaire's team -- an amateur, an enthusiast, whose whims, finances, prejudices and personal foibles can hold outsize influence on the fortunes of his or her franchise. Clippers fans were reminded of that fact rather crudely this week. What better response than to fix it once and for all, by selling the team straight to the fans, as a not-for-profit like the Packers, with a board of directors, and a strong general manager and president? The right thing to do, I think, is to give it to the people. Green Bay, not billionaires, is the model.","Billionaires are reported to be interested in buying L.A. Clippers if team put up for sale .

"(CNN) -- Dubai is home to the tallest building, largest mall and biggest candy shop. Recently, however, the city proved that its penchant for the extra large isn't limited to the inanimate. Last week, the Dubai Mall became home to a giant pacific octopus -- the largest species of octopus on the planet. The newest occupant, who lives at the mall's Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo, stretches out to a fear-inducing 14 feet, and weighs over 70 kilograms (154 pounds). Earlier this month, the aquarium announced it had acquired one of the largest known reptiles on the planet, a 1,600-pound crocodile they've dubbed King Croc (they also flew in his companion, Queen Croc). John Gerner, a theme park consultant and the managing director at Leisure Business Advisors, notes that the mall's current preoccupation with large animals is consistent with the Emirate's obsession with record-breaking pursuits. ""In a general, entertainment attractions have always been a way for countries to have bragging rights in the world. By having the best, the biggest and the fastest of everything, Dubai wants to show they've arrived on the world stage. In many ways, having record-breaking animals is another way to do that,"" he says. The country is no stranger to peppering its entertainment offerings with animals exotic to the region. In 2012, Ski Dubai -- the indoor ski slope housed at Mall of the Emirates -- welcomed a colony of King and Gentoo penguins. In 2008, Atlantis, The Palm hotel courted controversy from animal rights groups when it hosted a whale shark in its in-built aquarium. ""Lately, you're seeing attractions where you wouldn't typically find animals adding them in. It's a merging of concepts. At Atlantis, you have a lodging using an animal attraction as an amenity to justify higher room rates and occupancy,"" explains Gerner. It's a concept that doesn't sit well with local animal rights groups. ""In the wild, crocodiles spent hours swimming and can regulate the buoyancy and temperature or their bodies. No enclosure -- no matter how large -- is able to provide crocodiles with everything that is natural and important to them,"" says Ashley Fruno, the Asia and Middle East senior campaigner for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). ""If the Dubai Mall wants to set itself apart from the rest, there are other ways to do that than imprisoning wild animals in concrete enclosures and taking away everything that is natural and important to them,"" she adds. In a statement, Emaar, the developers for The Dubai Mall, note that King Croc and his companion were obtained from a crocodile farm in Australia. They add that the transfer was facilitated in partnership with Australian government authorities, who reviewed the quality of the display, qualifications of the staff caring for the animals and the educational purpose of the exhibit. Emaar also notes that the habitat made for the two crocodiles is three times the size specified by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The country's fascination with wild animals isn't always limited to the indoors. Last year the UAE's Ministry of Environment and Water issued bans on the commercial and personal import of a variety of exotic animals -- including many big cats and primates -- yet they remain popular pets for many Emiratis, who see them as a status symbol. Several locals have shot to Instagram fame showcasing their exotic animal collection. ""Unfortunately, the trade in exotic animals is largely unregulated and statistics are very difficult to come by,"" says Fruno. ""The animals pay the price for this trade. Many don't survive the journey from their homes in the wild, and those that do often die prematurely from malnutrition, an unnatural environment, loneliness and the overwhelming stress of confinement."" Still, she does note that animal rights -- though a newer concept in the UAE -- is on the rise.

"(CNN) -- The first officer aboard Malaysia Airlines MH370 when it disappeared early Saturday from radar was transitioning to work on the Boeing 777-200. Fariq Ab Hamid, a 27-year-old Malaysian, helped fly the plane from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur, where he landed it under the supervision of a senior pilot as well as a safety captain, according to CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest, who was also in the cockpit. The network was shooting video of the landing for use in a ""CNN Business Traveler"" program. ""It was interesting to watch the way he brought the aircraft in to land,"" Quest recalled about the February 19 landing, which the captain described as textbook-perfect. Hamid, who has 2,763 flying hours, joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007. He had been flying another jet and was transitioning to the Boeing 777-200 after having completed training in a flight simulator. The airline's first officers are trained to the same standards as the captains, Quest said he was told by airline officials. ""The captain was very much in control, but the first officer was flying the aircraft."" The missing plane was piloted by Capt.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's health deteriorated so badly in the last weeks of his life that he couldn't perform some of his trademark dance moves, according to evidence presented in his family's lawsuit against a concert promoter. Jurors in the wrongful death trial Friday watched a comparison of Jackson's performance of ""Billie Jean"" from 2001 with rehearsal video from June 2009, when he was preparing for his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts. ""I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now,"" production manager John ""Bugzee"" Houghdahl wrote in an e-mail to AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips on June 19, 2009. Show director Kenny Ortega sent Jackson home from a rehearsal that night because of his strange behavior. ""He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage, or worse yet -- get hurt,"" Houghdahl wrote. ""The company is rehearsing right now, but the DOUBT is pervasive."" Executives asked: Did Jackson need a straightjacket? The e-mail chain -- titled ""trouble at the Front"" -- is key evidence in the trial in which Jackson's mother and three children contend AEG Live is liable for the singer's death because it negligently hired, retained and supervised Dr. Conrad Murray. Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, told police he used the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia so he could be rested for rehearsals. The coroner ruled Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was caused by an overdose of propofol. AEG Live lawyers argue it was Jackson who chose and supervised Murray and that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous propofol treatments being administered in the privacy of Jackson's home. Houghdahl's e-mail came during a ""highly charged time"" when there was doubt the show would be ready for its London debut in July of that year, Phillips testified Friday. Phillips met with Dr. Murray, Michael Jackson and Ortega at Jackson's home a day after getting the Houghdahl e-mails, according to testimony. While Jackson lawyers argue that meeting was intended to pressure Murray to make sure Jackson was ready for rehearsals, AEG lawyers contend Dr. Murray assured producers nothing was wrong with him. 'Miracle' of Jackson's concert announcement described . AEG's lawyer showed jurors a clip Thursday of Jackson performing several non-consecutive 360-degree spins while rehearsing his song ""Billie Jean"" on June 5, 2009. Phillips described them as ""multiple 360 spins,"" although conceding he was not a choreographer. Jackson lawyers, in their rebuttal Friday, showed the jurors the side-by-side comparison of the routine in 2001 and the one weeks before Jackson's death that was seen in the ""This Is It"" documentary made from rehearsal video. ""Anywhere in the movie does it show Michael Jackson doing multiple 360 spins?"" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked Phillips. ""No,"" Phillips said.","Jurors watched a comparison of Jackson's performance of ""Billie Jean"" in '01 and '09 .

"(CNN) -- The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has long been known worldwide for its engineering programs, and a symposium at MIT this week will draw scientists from around the globe to focus on a hot facet of the field -- climate engineering. The title of the symposium itself underscores the questions surrounding climate-changing science: ""Engineering a Cooler Earth: Can We Do It? Should We Try?"" Climate engineering may sound a little Frankensteinian and worrisome, but it's not a new concept. Governments and militaries have tried over the years to control the weather for various reasons -- and have mostly failed. In the past decade, though, scientists have made major strides in developing technologies to cool the globe, and some of these processes are are gaining momentum among those who think drastic measures are needed to control the warming Earth. The subject is rife with controversy, including whether intentional climate engineering itself is even new. ""Very broadly, we're already engineering the climate. The question now is whether we should do it on purpose,"" said MIT associate professor of environmental policy and symposium participant Judith Layzer. ""That would involve taking action, inventing gizmos, and using them ideally to abate some of the warming that is expected to happen from global climate change."" But not everyone agrees that, through decades of massive pollution, humans have already interfered with the climate on a global scale, albeit unintentionally. Jim Fleming is a professor of science, technology and society at Colby College in Maine, and a speaker at the upcoming symposium. ""It's the inadvertent, 'engineering through pollution' argument, and I don't really agree with it,"" Fleming said. ""I'm a historian of science, and I believe humans have been intervening on purpose for much longer than people will admit. So one of the lessons of climate engineering, I think, is that some climate engineers insist they're the first generation to purpose this deliberate manipulation. ... I think history says otherwise."" There are several geo-engineering processes getting a lot of attention right now. Creating an artificial cloud cover, or modifying clouds to reflect light back into space, is one of them. But probably the more popular climate engineering technology now involves pumping sulfates into the atmosphere to block the sun's rays and cool temperatures, similar to what happens in volcanic eruptions. ""In 1830, the first national meteorologist of the U.S., James Espy, proposed making artificial volcanoes of his own. So whether it's weather or climate, this manipulation has been proposed and, in some cases attempted, for a very long time,"" Fleming said. Weather manipulation or modification can be traced to the 1940s and '50s, with a process called cloud seeding. In cloud seeding, many chemicals -- including dry ice and silver iodide -- were tried to produce rain or snow. In fact, author Kurt Vonnegut's brother, Bernie Vonnegut, invented silver iodide when he worked at General Electric in the 1950s. The Chinese and Russians have bragged about having weather-modifying technology for years. ""The Chinese have been claiming to have brought good weather to the Olympics for their parades. And the mayor of Moscow just said he was going to stop all snow in the city for the whole winter, but he didn't get a good response from the suburbs,"" Fleming said. MIT's Layzer thinks climate engineering will create new problems that will need their own solutions. ""The idea of taking a symptom of global warming, which is heat, and trying to mitigate that symptom seems to me to be just another form of parceling a large and comprehensive problem into bits and pieces, which will in turn need solutions."" Layzer also sees it this way: ""Climate engineering is just another example of treating a symptom. Treating problems in a piecemeal way, actually you just move the problem from one place to another. If you take pollution out of the air, you still have it. You have to put it somewhere, so you put it in the water. Then you've polluted the water."" All these issues will come up for discussion at the MIT symposium Friday. Fleming sums up the symposium as a chance perhaps to learn what might not work, in addition to what might. ""Tinkering with the planet is dangerous,"" he said. ""The lessons would be very similar to those learned in the weather control experiments. It would be very difficult to measure and it might have incredible inadvertent and unwelcome side effects.""","MIT symposium set to ask crucial questions about man's ability to change climate .
Some argue man has already manipulated the climate -- unwittingly .
Others argue trying to manipulate the weather could have unintended consequences .

"(CNN) -- A woman in California delivered what may be the nation's second live-born set of octuplets on Monday morning, surprising doctors who expected seven babies. Members of the delivery team assigned to assist in the birth of the octuplets, just minutes before the delivery. The six boys and two girls -- ranging in weight from 1 pound 8 ounces to 3 pounds 4 ounces -- were generally doing well in incubators following their Caesarean-section delivery at Kaiser Permanente hospital in Bellflower, California, doctors said. Three of the babies need breathing assistance, but otherwise the eight don't appear to have serious problems, doctors said at a news conference Monday evening. ""It was a truly amazing delivery,"" said Dr. Karen Maples, chief of the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department. Doctors initially believed the mother -- whom they did not identify -- was pregnant with seven fetuses. The woman was 23 weeks pregnant when she was hospitalized seven weeks ago and ordered to bed rest. Over a seven-week period, a team of 46 physicians, nurses and other staff prepared for the births. When they started the delivery Monday -- more than nine weeks before the babies would be full term -- they were in for a surprise. ""After we got to Baby G, we were surprised by the discovery of a Baby H,"" Maples said. Getting the number correct with ultrasounds before delivery is difficult with so many babies, said Dr. Harold Henry, the hospital's chief of fetal medicine. ""It is quite easy to miss a baby when you're expecting seven,"" Henry said. The hospital said the woman didn't want her personal information released to the news media, and it would not answer questions about whether she'd had  fertility treatments. Preliminary research indicates this is the second set of live-born octuplets in the United States, according to the hospital. Eight babies believed to be the United States' first set of live octuplets were born in Houston, Texas, in 1998. One of the infants died days after birth. The seven other siblings recently celebrated their 10th birthday, the Houston Chronicle reported last month. The first three to seven days will be critical for the California babies, said Dr. Mandhir Gupta, one of the doctors at the news conference. The infants could be in incubators for six to eight weeks and in the hospital for 10 weeks, Gupta said. The mother is doing ""very well"" after the deliveries, which took about five minutes, Gupta said. ""She is very excited that she [has] all these babies and that the babies are looking good so far,"" Gupta said.","Babies may be U.S.'s second set of live-born octuplets, California hospital says .

"(CNN) -- Malaysian authorities are bolstering security measures on the island of Borneo after a Chinese citizen was kidnapped by suspected Filipino rebels Tuesday. Gunmen armed with M-16 rifles abducted Yang Zailin, 34, from the fish farm where he worked on the east coast of Sabah around 2.45 am, the state's director general of security, Mohammad Mentek said in a statement Tuesday. The kidnappers, who are believed to be from the mainly Muslim southern part of the Philippines, fled by boat into international waters after exchanging gunfire with Malaysian security forces, the statement said. Originally from Guizhou province, Yang had been working in Sabah for three years as the manager of the farm, China's Deputy Consul General in Kuching, Liu Dong Yuan, told CNN. The farm belongs to a Hong Kong-owned company called Wonderful Terrace. Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Musa Aman said authorities are looking to introduce travel restrictions and curfews at high-risk spots around the coast of Sabah following the incident, according to local media reports. The kidnapping is the latest in a spate of abductions of foreigners in the area. On April 2, two women -- a Chinese tourist and a Filipino hotel worker -- were taken from a diving resort on the coast of Sabah. Authorities say the pair are being held for ransom, in the province of Sulu in the southern Philippines. Last November, a Taiwanese man died when he and his wife were kidnapped from another Sabah resort by suspected Abu Sayyaf gunmen. His wife was freed after being held hostage for more than a month on the island of Jolo, also in Sulu province. Early in 2013, Malaysia established a special security zone along Sabah's maritime border after insurgents from the southern Philippines stormed a village in the eastern district of Lahad Datu. The latest kidnappings could further strain diplomatic ties between Malaysia and China, which have had a tense relationship since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished on March 8. Many relatives of those on board the missing plane, most of whom were Chinese, have been fiercely critical of Malaysia's handling of the investigation.","Gunmen have kidnapped a Chinese man working in Malaysian Borneo .

"(CNN) -- Amazon's new Fire Phone isn't a phone. It's a shopping mall. Not that boring shopping mall slowly dying on the edges of suburban America, but a gorgeous mall with infinite selection and endless opportunities for entertainment, from books to movies and everything in between. The price starts at $199 with a two-year contract, or $649 without a contract. The Fire Phone may well give its competitors a run for the money. Malls are social spaces, and so is Fire Phone. Its five cameras and assorted sensors are exactly what is needed to create immersive interactive experience. And what better thing to socialize around than using it to identify new products, deals and scoops? The only piece missing from Amazon's new mall is food, but you can be sure that soon, there will be an Amazon Fresh truck waiting around the corner or an Amazon aerial drone hovering just over the horizon ready to deliver your order. Amazon is pretty late to the mobile space, and if Fire Phone was just another well-designed mobile device, it wouldn't have a prayer of catching up to Apple or Google. But Amazon isn't playing catch-up, it's changing the game by shifting the focus of mobile devices to what it does best: Satisfying our seemingly endless desire to buy stuff. Google is still struggling with creating a shopping strategy for physical products, and Apple is little more than an elegant specialty store in cyberspace. In contrast, Amazon pioneered online shopping and has reinvented the shopping experience time and again. Fire Phone is just the latest chapter in that long history. A crucial feature in the Fire Phone is Amazon's Firefly technology, which turns the phone into a one-touch information source for anything that can be viewed with the phone's many cameras. You see a cool jacket on an actor in a movie -- capture the image and Amazon will find it for sale. If you hear a song you like, grab a sample and Amazon will tell you the artist and offer to sell you a copy. Or, next time you are at your favorite suburban mall, snap a picture of a product in a physical store and Amazon will offer it to you for less. This may be the most diabolically disruptive aspect of the Fire Phone. While Apple and other companies are building out physical stores at great cost as part of their shopping strategy, Firefly allows Amazon to invade every store in every mall on the planet and turn it into a de facto showroom for Amazon. This will drive retailers crazy. Expect to hear much about how Fire Phone is going to kill physical shopping in the days to come. I wouldn't be surprised if some stores attempt to ban Fire Phone entirely. Once upon a time shopping was mainly ""bricks-and-mortar:"" an exclusively physical retail experience. After Amazon appeared on the Web, shopping evolved to ""bricks-and-clicks:"" an expanded shopping reality that provided shoppers the option of visiting either a physical space or a virtual space. Doomsayers proclaimed the end of physical stores, but while online shopping has been profoundly disruptive, the physical shopping experience evolved to coexist with shopping in cyberspace. We are now moving from ""bricks-and-clicks"" to ""bricks-in-clicks:"" a world where the line between physical and virtual not only blurs, but becomes a two-way conversation. Getting competitive pricing with your phone camera is just the start. The next phase will be ""augmented reality"" shopping. Want to see if that elegant lounge chair really fits in your living room? Select your chair, hit a button and it appears on your screen as if it were actually in your room. You can even walk around the chair, viewing it from multiple perspectives. Sounds futuristic, but iPhone and Android users can experience this today with apps like Sayduck. With five cameras and multiple sensors, Fire Phone will be able to do this with even greater fidelity. Amazon's Fire Phone is being released at a moment when we are seeing the rapid growth of the so-called ""Internet of Things,"" where billions of physical objects from toothbrushes to satellite sensors are being connected to the Internet. Before long, shoppers wandering into a physical store won't use their phones to merely take a picture of an object; they will have a phone-mediated conversation with that object. And when that happens, Jeff Bezos will probably reinvent things again.","Paul Saffo: Amazon isn't playing catch-up, it's changing the game in mobile space .

"(CNN) -- The brain is one of the last great frontiers of science. For all it does for us -- driving our thoughts, actions, perceptions and making us who we are -- we understand very little about how it works, its underlying biochemistry. We know a fair amount about what parts of the brain are involved in particular functions from studies that track blood flow to reveal the locations of brain activity during certain behaviors or processes. We know that the back of the brain, the cerebellum, keeps us upright and is involved in coordinated movement. We know that the sides of the brain, the temporal cortex, is involved in primary auditory processing, allowing us to hear words and send them into higher language processing centers. And we know the area toward the front of the brain is where complex thought and decision-making occur. But taking a deeper look into the brain, beyond these broad areas of function, there is a great deal that is far less understood. The brain is incredibly complex, with about 86 billion nerve cells, called neurons, forming about 100 trillion connections, all working in concert to drive our thoughts, emotions, reactions and interactions with the world around us. Each neuron is largely unique, driven by fundamental properties of its underlying biochemistry -- proteins controlling everything the nervous system has to do. All these proteins are encoded by our genome, comprising roughly 25,000 genes encoded in our DNA. The nature and activity of a given neuron is dictated by which of these 25,000 genes are turned on and to what level. TED.com: A light switch for neurons . How does it all work? What are the roles of each neuron and how are they connected to our ultimate experience with the world? To answer these questions, we are seeking to understand which of our 25,000 genes are turned on in the brain, and where. To this end, we have created a free online resource accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime: the Allen Human Brain Atlas. The brain mapping process is complex and visually captivating, starting with a fresh, whole brain in the lab through to the molecular magnets that detect activity, or expression, of individual genes, and the subsequent informatics used to render this information into a meaningful piece of software that can be used to analyze the brain in more detail than we have ever had access to. In 2006 we completed a map of the mouse brain. The mouse is the most common model for studying the mammalian brain, with the same basic parts and organization. The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas is used every day by thousands of scientists around the world. Creating this atlas put us in the unique position to tackle the challenges inherent in mapping the human brain. Our laboratory receives fresh human brains that satisfy strict criteria -- no history of neurologic or psychiatric disease, no drug or alcohol abuse, and no brain damage occurring at death, among other criteria. We collect 3-D, MRI-based images of each whole brain to serve as a ""scaffolding"" from which we later map the gene expression information. Brains must be evaluated, imaged and frozen within 24 hours after death to preserve the signal we need to measure. The brain is then sliced very thinly â€” 25 micrometers thick, thinner than a human hair â€” and sections are transferred to microscope slides, which are stained and analyzed for clusters and distributions of brain cells that provide a reference, kind of like a rough road map, to identify distinct regions in the brain. TED.com: How to re-engineer a brain . We then take samples from each of these distinct regions (more than 1,000 of them), purify the RNA -- the signal indicating if a gene is turned on -- and obtain a readout of the level of activity of each gene for each area. This method gives us roughly 50 million data points for each human brain. We put all that together into a single interactive database with meaningful search and visualization tools that are all freely available online at human.brain-map.org. The goal is that this database will speed discovery, launching us into a new era of understanding of the human brain. Direct applications will be fruitful in areas like drug discovery, enhancing efficacy and reducing side effects of drugs for mental illness and disease. Further, we can start to connect the ""what"" to the ""where"" of gene expression in the brain, elucidating common pathways and beginning to unravel the mysteries of the inner workings of the brain's underlying biochemistry.

"Austin, TEXAS (CNN) -- Pliny Fisk III has been called a ""mad scientist,"" a ""dreamer"" and a ""visionary."" His favorite word to describe the architectural work he does is ""crazy."" Pliny Fisk hopes his ideas like the ""megacrete"" will revolutionze how office buildings are built. Spending a day with Fisk on his 18-acre work site outside of Austin, Texas is like riding a rocket blast into the future. ""To be free to do what we're doing is absolute magic,"" Fisk recently told CNN. Pliny Fisk opened the non-profit Center for Maximum Potential Building (CMPB) in 1975 and he also teaches architecture at Texas A&M University. Running around his architectural compound are some 10 interns, from around the world, always carrying out experiments.  Watch Pliny Fisk at work in Austin, Texas » . Fisk's mission is to develop environmentally-sustainable building materials and to fundamentally change the way we build our communities, like homes and office buildings. Early in his career, Fisk might have appeared like a wacky wizard working in a secret laboratory in the Texas Hill country mesquite brush. But not anymore. Fisk is now considered to be on the cutting edge. On the day we visit Fisk he's about to launch the first prototype test of his latest invention -- an environmentally friendly cement and building structure. Fisk hopes these new ideas will revolutionize how homes and office buildings are built and how communities are planned and organized. The cement will be called ""megacrete."" Fisk says it will be made of magnesium oxide and phosphate from brine, which is a by-product of petroleum and water treatment facilities. If that doesn't make sense, Fisk makes it sound simple. He likes to say he's just taking waste and making buildings out of it. ""The world has changed,"" Fisk said. ""You used to think of waste stuff as a problem... now you look at that waste stuff as a huge business opportunity."" The cement will hold together building modules that are essentially self-contained structures created from local and regional building materials.  See photos of Fisk's proposed modules » . Pliny Fisk envisions a world where building materials leave a carbon-neutral footprint, a world where people tap into surrounding resources to create environmentally sustainable communities. That means we have to change where and how we get our building materials and cutting down on the distance those materials are transported. ""We've become very hard core unadaptable and so we expect nature to follow us,"" Fisk said. ""We're always striving to get to that point where we become as adaptable as nature is."" Pliny Fisk lives what he preaches. He and his wife live where they work. Their water source is ""off the city's grid."" They capture rain water to drink and water their landscape.

"(CNN) -- The mayor of East Haven, Connecticut, apologized Wednesday for saying he would help Latinos in his town by eating tacos, a remark that sparked anger from state officials and immigrant advocates already fuming over allegations of police mistreatment of Latinos in his city. ""My sincerest apologies go out to the East Haven community and, in particular, the Latino community for the insensitive and off-color comment that I made to WPIX reporter Mario Diaz yesterday regarding the recent events affecting our community and our police department,"" Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, I let the stress of the situation get the best of me and inflamed what is already a serious and unfortunate situation."" He was referring to the arrests of four East Haven police officers by FBI agents Tuesday for their alleged roles in abusing Latino residents and business owners, performing illegal searches, making false arrests and harassing immigrant rights advocates. The arrests are the first to stem from a federal investigation into racial profiling in the city and follow a scathing December report from the U.S. Justice Department that accused the town's police of engaging in ""discriminatory policing against Latinos."" In the interview later Tuesday, Diaz pointed out that there were no Latino officers on the police force. ""And your point being?"" Maturo responded. When asked then what he planned to do for the Latino community in light of the discrimination allegations, the mayor said, ""I might have tacos when I go home, I'm not quite sure yet."" Gov. Dannel P. Malloy on Wednesday slammed Maturo's comment as ""repugnant"" and ""unacceptable."" Malloy said the remarks ""represent either a horrible lack of judgment or worse, an underlying insensitivity to our Latino community that is unacceptable."" ""He owes an apology to the community, and more importantly, he needs to show what he's going to do to repair the damage he's done,"" the governor said. ""And he needs to do it today."" Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra added Wednesday that he was ""disgusted by Mayor Maturo's comment."" He said Maturo's words suggested that the accusations of discrimination were ""dismissed and disregarded."" ""Many have worked diligently to correct the painful history of racism in this country, and Mayor Maturo's comments are a disappointing example of how far we still have to go to,"" said Segarra. Maturo on Tuesday called the arrests of the officers ""unfortunate"" and said his office ""stands behind the East Haven Police Department."" Following his apology a day later, Maturo then asked the public to consider the difficulties the arrested officers and their families must be going through in the wake of the scandal. ""It's really a devastation to them,"" he told CNN. ""It's my apology to the communities out there; whether they're Latino or not is secondary to what our town is suffering and going through at this particular time."" Maturo made no mention of any of the alleged Latino victims in the case. ""What I apologized most to (WPIX reporter) Mario was that I think I might have hurt him personally, and I can understand that,"" the mayor added. ""Being of Italian descent, there's been plenty of people that have said to me, 'Oh you live in East Haven,' and we all know what that refers to. Or, 'Oh you're Italian; you must like meatballs and spaghetti.' We all know what that refers to. And sometimes I take those comments to heart, (even) when I realize sometimes there was nothing meant by them."" ""I've been talking since 6 o'clock yesterday morning,"" Maturo added, saying he had done more than a dozen interviews. He later claimed that his comment had been taken out of context. On Tuesday, the mayor cautioned against the blaming police prematurely. ""They're innocent until proven guilty,"" he said. Maturo added that he doesn't believe allegations of such systemic discrimination in East Haven are accurate. ""We have an open community here,"" he said, speaking on behalf of the police department. However, Maturo said his town ""is prepared to do all that is necessary to address the consequences of (the) grand jury indictment."" Still, many Latino residents of East Haven say they've for years had to contend with an overly aggressive police force. ""They always come by and bother us,"" said Esdras Marin, a manager at La Bamba, a Latino-owned bar and restaurant named in the indictment. ""Police come in two or three times a month and ask everyone in the restaurant for their identification,"" he said. ""And if you don't have it, they threaten us and say they're going to call the immigration office."" The effect, Marin said, has left many in the town's Latino community fearful of East Haven authorities. One incident occurred in La Bamba's parking lot on November 22, 2008, the indictment said, when officer Dennis Spaulding allegedly handcuffed an individual on false pretenses and threw him down onto the pavement, causing a ""deep cut"" to the man's chin. Spaulding then allegedly kicked the man repeatedly, and later fabricated a false report to ""conceal and cover-up his assault,"" it said. Others, such as Chino Perez, an East Haven hairdresser at Maly's Salon, said he's seen police harassing individuals just outside his salon. He called the mayor's comments racist, and that while he accepts his apology, he said Maturo can't easily be trusted. East Haven resident Carolina Borja added that police have also commonly stopped her Latino friends for questioning. It ""has to change,"" she said. Though Tuesday's arrests and Maturo's errant comment have likely blemished the reputation of this New Haven suburb, there have been changes since the Justice Department report, the mayor noted. An independent commission of community members, external consultants and former law enforcement officials has since been formed to adjust police patrol and complaint policies. The mayor cited a series of reforms, pointing to a revised East Haven police handbook -- the first update since 1972. ""It was an outdated book,"" Maturo said. According to 2010 census data, East Haven has a population of some 29,000 people, with about 10.3% identifying as Hispanic or Latino. Federal authorities, meanwhile, are asking the public for additional tips surrounding alleged discrimination and abuse, offering anonymity to those would-be tipsters concerned about their legal resident status.

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit killed a regulation that is key to making Obamacare work. Its decision in Halbig v. Burwell, if it were the last word on the matter, would have significant -- and damaging -- consequences for millions of Americans who purchase health insurance on exchanges established and run by the federal government. Fortunately, it won't be the last word on the matter. And the decision issued later Tuesday by another federal appellate court -- the 4th Circuit -- in King v. Burwell makes clear why: The D.C. Circuit's decision got basically everything wrong. It misunderstood the text, structure and purpose of the Affordable Care Act. The Justice Department has already indicated that it will ask the entire D.C. Circuit to review the Halbig v. Burwell decision, and when it does, it will no doubt reverse it. These two cases are both part of what Judge Harry Edwards, the dissenting judge in Halbig, termed a ""not-so-veiled attempt to gut"" the Affordable Care Act. As the members of Congress who led the enactment of the law made clear in a ""friend of the court"" brief they submitted to both courts this year, the fundamental purpose of the statute was to achieve universal health care coverage, and the Internal Revenue Service providing tax credits that act as subsidies so low- and middle-income Americans can pay for health care is central to doing so. The plaintiffs in these challenges argue that these tax credits should not be available to people who buy insurance in the 36 states with exchanges operated by the federal government -- that is, who got their subsidized health coverage through HealthCare.gov, not a state-run exchange. It's a position that's not only completely without legal merit -- ""tortured"" and ""nonsensical,"" according to one of the 4th Circuit judges -- it's also one that would critically undermine how Obamacare works. What the Obamacare court decisions mean for you . But rather than looking at the law as a whole and considering what it was attempting to accomplish, the D.C. Circuit judges focused on one small provision of what is a long and complicated statute. Edwards called the plaintiffs' argument ""illogical when cast in the context of the statute as a whole."" Indeed, the plaintiffs themselves appeared to recognize how flawed their argument, based on the statute's language, was and thus manufactured an explanation for why Congress would have written the statute to eliminate the tax credits on federally facilitated exchanges. According to the plaintiffs, Congress wanted to encourage the states to set up their own exchanges. The only problem, as Edwards noted, is that the ""claim is nonsense, made up out of whole cloth."" The legal reasoning in the majority's opinion is so weak it is difficult to understand it as anything but a political decision. And that is what makes particularly galling the judges' professed ""reluctance"" to reach their conclusion. These judges assert that their hands were tied by the ""limited"" role of judges in our democratic system. In other words, they imply, their decision -- which could have massive consequences for millions of Americans -- was actually an exercise of judicial restraint. Appeals courts differ on Obamacare . There's nothing restrained about misreading a law's text, disregarding its structure and ignoring its purpose. In fact, it was the 4th Circuit judges who exercised true judicial restraint. Two of those judges concluded that the statute was unclear and that they should therefore defer to the agencies charged with implementing the law -- in this case, the IRS, which would provide the tax credit subsidies. (The other judge concluded that the statute is unambiguous, but in the other direction, and requires that tax credits be available on federally facilitated exchanges.) As those judges recognized, where a law is unclear, the proper role of a judge is generally to defer to a reasonable construction offered by the executive branch agencies charged with implementing the statute. The judges in Halbig seemed so determined to undermine the Affordable Care Act that they ignored this bedrock legal principle. Fortunately, they won't have the last word on the subject.","Brianne Gorod: D.C. Circuit panel got it wrong by dealing blow to how Obamacare works .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys have dropped a lawsuit alleging that Taco Bell's beef was mostly not beef, both sides in the legal battle said. Alabama-based law firm Beasley Allen claimed in the class-action lawsuit in January that lab tests had shown that the eatery's beef was actually only 35 percent beef. The plaintiffs said they wanted the fast-food restaurant to stop referring to its products as beef. Taco Bell's leadership vowed to fight the lawsuit. They took out newspaper ads in January slamming the claims as ""absolutely false."" In a full-page ad in major newspapers, Taco Bell proclaimed, ""Thank you for suing us."" ""Our reputation's been falsely tarnished,"" Greg Creed, Taco Bell's president, said in January. Creed said at the time that the company was considering legal action on these ""egregious"" accusations against the chain's beef. On Monday, Taco Bell said the company had been vindicated. ""As Taco Bell has stated before, the allegations in the lawsuit and in public statements about Taco Bell's seasoned beef, food quality and advertising were absolutely wrong,"" the company said in a statement. ""No money or other value was exchanged between the parties...."" Creed added: ""This sets the record straight about the high quality of our seasoned beef."" The Beasley Allen law firm confirmed the lawsuit was dropped but also said it had pushed Taco Bell to make changes -- an assertion that Taco Bell disputed. ""As a result of the lawsuit, changes in marketing and product disclosure were made by the company, allowing us to dismiss the case,"" the law firm said in a statement.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Days before a court in eastern China announced the date for delivering the much anticipated verdict in the trial of Bo Xilai, the disgraced Communist Party leader reiterated his innocence but anticipated lengthy imprisonment in a letter to his family. ""I was dragged into this and really wronged, but the truth will come out one day,"" wrote Bo in a letter dated September 12, referring to the bribes allegedly taken by his wife and other scandals involving her and her friends. ""Meanwhile I will be waiting quietly in prison,"" Bo continued. ""Dad was thrown into prison multiple times in his lifetime and I will look up to him as my role model."" Bo's late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Chairman Mao Zedong and late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. During the tumultuous Cultural Revolution that Mao launched in 1966, however, the senior Bo was persecuted, tortured and imprisoned for over a decade. He was ""rehabilitated"" in 1979 and became one of the most influential senior politicians under Deng. 5 big moments from the trial . ""Dad and Mom have passed away, but their teachings are deeply ingrained in my mind,"" Bo wrote. ""I will never bring disgrace to them and their glory. I can bear the suffering no matter how great it is. ""I have put Mom's photo by my bed. With her by my side, I don't feel lonely."" A source with close ties to the Bo family confirmed to CNN the authenticity of the letter, which has been circulating on the Internet. She adds that the content online is only part of the original letter, which appears to be addressing the family members -- including a son and four siblings -- present in the courtroom during his trial. Timeline: The Bo scandal . In a hearing on Sunday, the Jinan Intermediate People's Court in the province of Shandong found Bo guilty of bribe-taking, embezzlement and abuse of power. He was sentenced to life in prison. During the hearings of the politically sensitive trial that took place last month, Bo, 64, strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the court. The closely watched trial was considered to be much more transparent than most cases in China. But international and independent journalists weren't allowed inside the courtroom, and doubts were raised about the fullness of the court's version of events. High conviction rate . His trial brought to light a wealth of eye-opening details about the apparently lavish and emotionally fraught life of his family and inner circle, giving Chinese people insights into how some of the ruling elite live. Read more: Corruption fight a political purge? Bo's glittering career, during which he drew both admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery. Dramatic downfall . The son of a revolutionary veteran, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. He had been tipped to ascend farther up the party hierarchy. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February 2012 and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was involved in a murder case, Bo's career began to unravel. Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise. Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts. A court found Gu guilty last year of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in 2011. She was given a suspended death sentence. The following month, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. Wang and Gu both appeared as witnesses at Bo's trial last month. Bo attacked their testimony and even claimed that Wang and Gu had been romantically involved.

"Athens (CNN) -- Having to skip cancer therapy twice in the last two months due to a lack of drugs normally available through Greece's national health system, 45-year-old Morfo Karadona says a new fear has entered her life. ""I have been battling cancer for the last six years. Now I can't find the drugs I need. Ensuring I get my treatment every two weeks is a matter of life and death for me."" Karadona is one of thousands of Greeks trapped in a vicious circle involving a cash-strapped government unable to pay its bills. She spoke as some international pharmaceutical companies have limited supplies to Greece, and increased fears of a parallel export trade as wholesalers and pharmacies look for cash. Diagnosed as the sick man of Europe, Greece is in its sixth year of recession and hugely in debt, struggling to put its finances in order. While servicing a massive bailout loan to its lenders, the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the state owes pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies around 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) through accumulated debt, Health Minister Andreas Lykouretzos admits. The president of Greece's Association of Pharmaceutical Companies, Konstantinos Frouzis, who is also the vice president of Novartis Greece, warns that ""companies are heading towards a dead end. It is impossible to run a business when there is no cash flow to plan ahead."" There are legal limitations to ensure that drugs cannot be treated like any other commodity: Pharmaceutical companies are legally bound to continue to supply hospitals with so called ""critical medicines,"" which include those dealing with life-threatening diseases such as HIV. But patients and NGOs, including Alma Zois, which supports women with breast cancer, said they receive calls on their helplines from panic-stricken people who can't get hold of the medicines they need. What really went wrong in Greece? Under the current Greek system, customers can buy some critical medicines from pharmacies and are later reimbursed by the state. At state pharmacies and hospitals they can get the medicines directly. This means poorer customers are ""guaranteed"" immediate access to ""critical"" drugs, but if there are shortages at state pharmacies and hospitals then this excludes access for people who can't pay upfront. Thirteen companies have been investigated, with eight of those found to have reduced supplies, according to the national drug regulator's president Ioannis Toundas. The firms involved have yet to be identified, but the list is understood to include large multinational corporations; they are expected to face heavy fines, Toundas said. Toundas estimates shortages of 200 medicines out of a total of 12,500 available in Greece. An export ban on 60 drugs has been issued to ensure a sufficient supply in the internal market. Roche spokesperson Daniel Grotsky said the company is withholding some non-critical drugs until it is paid the 200 million euros it is owed by the Greek state. ""We are insisting that the public hospitals fulfill their contracts and this is something we do in any country,"" he said. ""We are withholding medicines until they meet their obligations."" Greece has among the cheapest medicines in the European Union and has just announced further price drops. This makes drugs more affordable at a time when a rising number of unemployed Greeks have lost their health-care coverage but it comes with side-effects: supply problems, and an increase in ""parallel export trade."" After years of mismanagement and overspending the health ministry is under pressure to make cuts to the social funds which cover the cost of most drugs. Dimitris Karageorgiou, general secretary of the Panhellenic Pharmaceutical Association, described the new price list as ""infuriating."" ""Some prices are artificially low to show expenditure cuts to Greece's lenders,"" Karagiorgou said. ""The move could push pharmaceuticals to further reduce supplies to Greece because of low profits. The companies only care about money, not people."" ""The low prices mean that it is about three times cheaper to buy a box of aspirin in Greece than it is in Germany"", said chemist Marios Kamberis, ""but it increases parallel trade."" Wholesalers are legally allowed to sell medicines to other European countries, including at higher prices, as long as they can guarantee sufficient supply for the Greek market for three months. But increasingly wholesalers, and sometimes pharmacies, break the rules and sell larger quantities than they are allowed to other EU markets in search of a quick profit. As cash becomes scarcer in Greece, more and more people turn to this kind of trade. ""The state is so late with our payments so we keep delaying payments to wholesalers,"" says Kamberis. ""But increasingly they no longer accept credit. And we do the same. All transactions of goods are now upfront, so people have to look outside Greece because there is no money here."" Deputy Health Minister Marios Salmas said the current shortage of medicines in the Greek market is artificial. Salmas blamed wholesalers and pharmacies for exporting large quantities of drugs destined for Greeks to wealthier EU countries to increase profit. This parallel trade has long been an issue. It is a fundamental problem of any free trade area, such as the EU, where movement of goods is not only legal but encouraged. Greece is a poorer country, and medicines there have always cost less so wholesalers have always sold them for more outside the country. This is also the case with Spain and generally the countries of the south. And what is happening in the health sector is indicative of what is happening in all facets of Greek life. The country is turning into a cash economy. With no money to go around Greeks now face shortages and despair. Paying for the drugs herself, even in cases of emergency, is not a viable option for patients like Karadona, who works in education in the public sector. With her cancer treatment costing 2,500 euros a month -- but a gross monthly salary of just under half of that -- it is impossible for her to cover her medical bills. ""My husband and I also have two children to support. His business as a fishmonger has also dropped because of the financial crisis as people eat less fresh fish to save money."" In the center of Athens, in one of a handful of state pharmacies, people are looking for prescription drugs that hospitals no longer have in stock. Number 371, later introduced as 75-year-old Marina Kambaki, gets up from her orange plastic chair to reach the counter only to be told that her diabetes medicine is no available, and she should come back in a few days. ""But I must take it today. This is not something that can wait,"" she says. This is the third of the five such authorized pharmacies in Athens that she has traveled to that day, desperate to find her much-needed medication. ""I used to be a social worker. I have paid my contributions all my life and now that I am old my pension has been slashed to almost half and my country is leaving me to rot."" Many of those waiting in line offer similar accounts, echoing the frustration over what they see as the breach of a social contract. A team of officials representing Greece's creditors is currently in Athens, assessing progress and planning ahead. The pharmaceutical budget is on the agenda after being severely slashed last year. Austerity has been applied as the main treatment for Greece's many ailments and further cuts may be ahead as forecasts show that the country's economy is expected to contract by a further 4 to 4.5% this year. But without growth Greece remains on life support, dependent on its creditors. The government is optimistic that growth is around the corner, and that recovery will be visible within the year, with investors and depositors regaining confidence as talk of an exit from the eurozone has subsided. The much anticipated bank recapitalization, expected to be completed in spring, will be a first, much needed, boost. It will take some time before the effects of cash injections become visible to ordinary Greek people like Karadona, who wake every day to the fear of not being able to find life-saving drugs. Until then they will carry on tasting the bitter medicine of austerity that opinion polls suggest most believe has been applied in such strong doses as to kill the patient.","Some international pharmaceutical companies have limited supplies to Greece .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea announced Friday that it has detained a U.S. citizen who it says entered the secretive country as a tourist in April and broke the law. The news brings the number of Americans believed to be held in the communist nation to three. The North's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that authorities are investigating a man who it said violated the law by acting ""contrary to the purpose of tourism."" In a brief English-language article, KCNA gave the American's name as Jeffrey Edward Fowle, saying he arrived as a tourist on April 29. It didn't give any other details. Citing unidentified diplomatic sources, the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that Fowle was part of a tour group and that he was detained in mid-May after allegedly leaving a Bible in a hotel where he had been staying. The U.S. State Department said it was ""aware of reports that a third U.S. citizen was detained in North Korea."" But it declined to provide any further information, saying it couldn't share details about specific cases without written consent from an individual. ""There is no greater priority for us than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad,"" a State Department official said. North Korea says it has another American in custody . Other Americans held . North Korea said in late April it was holding a different American man, who it claimed came the country seeking asylum. He tore his tourist visa and shouted that ""he would seek asylum"" and ""came to the DPRK (North Korea) after choosing it as a shelter,"" KCNA said. KCNA identified that man as Miller Matthew Todd, who it says was taken into custody on April 10. The U.S. State Department said at the time that it was aware of the report and had been in touch with Sweden, which represents American interests in North Korea, about the matter. It declined to disclose any further information. North Korea is also holding Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2013 by a court that said he had carried out acts aimed at bringing down the regime of leader Kim Jong Un. Although North Korea contains a number of state-controlled churches, the totalitarian regime forbids independent religious activities, viewing them as potential threats to its authority. Other Americans detained in the North have later been released. Last year, Pyongyang freed Merrill Newman, an 85-year-old veteran of the Korean War who was on an organized private tour in the country, after holding him for several weeks. Kenneth Bae worried about his health in North Korean camp . Accused of spying and setting up church, South Korean sentenced in North Korea . CNN's K.J.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paris Jackson, the 14-year-old daughter of Michael Jackson, is being questioned Thursday about her father's last days as part of her family's wrongful death lawsuit against a concert promoter. In addition, Jackson lawyers told the judge in a court filing this week they were concerned that lawyers for AEG Live, the company accused of liability in Jackson's death, were ""behaving aggressively and erratically"" in their questioning of the Jackson children. AEG Live asked Los Angeles Superior Judge Yvette Palazuelos to order Blanket Jackson to appear for a deposition, but his doctor warned it would be ""medically detrimental"" to the 10-year-old boy, according to the court filing. When AEG Live lawyers deposed Prince Jackson, 16, earlier this month, they asked questions intended ""to agitate the boy, creating serious concern among his guardians and attorneys,"" the document said. Prince ""testified that he was intimately involved in his father's affairs,"" an AEG Live lawyer said in an e-mail defending the questioning. The wrongful death lawsuit is a high-stakes contest. Prince, Paris, Blanket and their grandmother, Katherine Jackson, are suing AEG Live for billions of dollars. The trial is set to begin in Los Angeles next month. Jackson lawyers complained that AEG Live lawyers engaged in ""a concerted tactical effort made to harass and burden the Jackson family through these abusive discovery processes."" While Blanket -- who was just 6 when his father died on June 25, 2009 -- will not be called as a witness in the trial, AEG Live has tried to force him to sit for a deposition, the filing said. Blanket's doctor provided a letter saying it would be ""medically detrimental"" to the boy. ""Yet defendants still to this day say they may move to compel Blanket's deposition,"" the Jackson filing said. Jackson lawyers accused AEG Live lawyers of mistreating Prince when he was deposed on a recent Saturday. They ""behaved in a manner designed to agitate the boy, creating serious concern among his guardians and attorneys,"" their filing said. ""Defense counsel asked the boy completely irrelevant and repetitive personal questions about whether he sends text messages, whether he send text messages from his phone, and whether he 'tweets,'"" they said. ""Defense counsel also asked the boy about every place he had ever lived, every teacher he had ever had and about his current efforts to start a career in addition to being a full-time student -- none of which have anything to do with the case at hand."" AEG Live lawyer Jessica Stebbins Bina, in an e-mail included in the court filing, defended her co-counsel Marvin Putnam's questioning of Prince. ""My understanding is that the deposition proceeded with appropriate questioning, and that the questions were legitimate questions appropriate to a wrongful death suit,"" she said. The Jackson lawyers also complained about the questioning of family matriarch Katherine Jackson, who is 82. AEG Live lawyers deposed her for nine hours over three days and are asking for a fourth chance, they said. The questioning could have been easily done in two or three hours, they told the judge. The lawsuit contends that AEG Live is responsible for Jackson's death because it hired and supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was administering the surgical anesthetic propofol to Jackson each night for a month to induce sleep as he prepared for a series of concerts organized by AEG Live. AEG Live contends that Michael Jackson chose Murray as his personal physician. The promoter denies having hired or supervised Murray. A jury found Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter after hearing testimony that he violated medical standards in his treatment of Jackson.","AEG Live also want to depose Blanket, 10, but doctor warns it would be ""detrimental""

"(CNN) -- How can a Boeing 777-200ER passenger jet go missing for more than a day? Turns out, it's not so easy. That's not just because the state-of-the-art jetliner has a wing span of nearly 200 feet and a length of more than 209 feet. It's also because it's bristling with communications gear, including radios, automatic beacons, GPS and computer communications systems, according to CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. In addition to carrying UHF and VHF radios, the planes -- which cost more than $250 million apiece -- are equipped with Aircraft Communications and Reporting System technology. Embedded in the plane's computers, it tells the airline how the aircraft is performing -- speed, fuel, thrust. ""If anything fails, it will send a signal to Malaysia Airlines,"" Quest said. The deadliest commercial airline crashes . Though officials do not know what happened to Flight MH370, whatever it may have been must have been catastrophic, he said. ""Planes don't fall out of the sky at 36,000 feet."" Asked to detail the communications devices aboard the missing jet, Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said, ""It's not appropriate for us to discuss that right now."" Still, there is precedent for a modern jetliner to fall from the sky while ""in the cruise"" and lay hidden for months, Quest said. On June 1, 2009, Air France flight 447 was en route from Rio De Janeiro to Paris' Charles de Gaulle International Airport when communications ended suddenly from the Airbus A330, another state-of-the-art aircraft. ""One of the first things we had was a series of ACARS messages that showed failure of the aircraft and degradation of the systems,"" Quest said. ""What we didn't know was why. We knew what had gone wrong; we knew how it had gone wrong; we didn't know why it had gone wrong."" It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of flight 447's wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean. It took even longer to find the cause of the disaster. In May 2011, the aircraft's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles. It was not until July 2012 that investigators published their report, which blamed the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems. France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis detailed how the pilots failed to respond effectively to problems with the plane's speed sensors or to correct its trajectory when things started to go wrong. When ice crystals blocked the plane's pitot tubes, which are part of a system used to determine air speed, the autopilot disconnected and the pilots did not know how to react, the report said. ""The occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise completely surprised the crew of flight AF 447,"" the report said. The crew responded by over-handling the aircraft, which destabilized its flight path and caused further confusing readings, the report said. ""In the first minute after the autopilot disconnection, the failure of the attempt to understand the situation and the disruption of crew cooperation had a multiplying effect, inducing total loss of cognitive control of the situation."" The Airbus A330 went into a sustained stall, signaled by a warning message and buffeting of the aircraft, the report said. ""Despite these persistent symptoms, the crew never understood they were in a stall situation and therefore never undertook any recovery maneuvers."" The pilots responded by pointing the nose upward, rather than downward, to recover. ""That rewrote our understanding of what happens in massive crashes like this,"" Quest said. ""In 447, you had a minor malfunction of the aircraft, and the pilot flew the airplane in a way that caused it to crash."" Plane was 'at safest point' in flight .","The Boeing 777-200ER is bristling with communications gear .

"(CNN) -- Jury selection begins Thursday in a Greensboro, North Carolina, federal courtroom in the trial of former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards. Edwards is charged with six felony and misdemeanor counts related to the money dealings of his failed 2008 presidential campaign. Rielle Hunter, Edwards' former mistress, is expected to testify at the trial. A major issue in the approaching trial is whether money given to support Hunter, by the former candidate's benefactors, should have been considered donations toward his presidential campaign. Edwards denies any wrongdoing, claiming the money was a gift. Edwards is accused of conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws. If convicted on all counts, Edwards could face 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.5 million. Edwards' attorneys have claimed the investigation and prosecution are politically motivated, and the charges do not clearly establish any violation of election law. Edwards was Sen. John Kerry's running mate on the 2004 Democratic presidential ticket. His wife, Elizabeth, died of cancer in December 2010. Elizabeth and John Edwards separated that year, shortly after he admitted that he had fathered a daughter with Hunter, who was hired to make documentary videos for his 2008 campaign. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","If convicted on all counts, John Edwards could face 30 years in prison .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Presidential candidate John Edwards will have to pay back over 2 million dollars in federal matching funds given to his 2008 campaign for president, the Federal Election Commission ruled on Thursday. The commission voted 6 - 0 against Edwards and contends his campaign was in ""excess of the Candidate's entitlement."" ""At the end of the day if there were more matching funds received than campaign obligations at the point when the campaign ended you have to make a repayment, "" Ellen Weintraub, FEC Commissioner said during the hearing. This latest ruling comes on the heels of Edwards' indictment last month when a federal grand jury charged him with six counts, including conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws . That indictment was brought up Thursday by FEC Commissioner Donald McGahn who called it ""the pink elephant in the room."" McGahn then asked other members of the Commission how a guilty verdict might impact Edwards' finance filings and force him to amend what the campaign spent. His trial is scheduled to start in October. ""This gets a little confusing, this has not come up like this before,"" FEC Commissioner Donald McGahn said during the hearing. The FEC determined that Edwards had received just over 2.1 million dollars in matching funds after the campaign was winding down and Edwards was no longer in the race. The commission decided that in total his campaign must pay back $2,278,315 in excess matching funds. According to the FEC, ""Presidential candidates receive federal government funds to pay for the valid expenses of their political campaigns in both the primary and general elections."" Edwards was represented at the hearing by his lawyers who filed this response to the audit. ""John Edwards for President did not receive any matching funds in excess of its entitlement, and hence, no repayment is due,"" they countered. Edwards' presidential campaign committee says it has $2.6 million in cash-on-hand as of June 30, 2011. It is unclear whether Edwards will use this money to pay back the US Government or if he will seek an appeal, his attorneys left the hearing without comment.","An FEC audit showed Edwards' campaign exceeded its matching funds .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's taken 11 years, thousands of miles and a few fistfuls of dollars for Josh Tickell to complete his film. But when you've devoted your life to a cause as important as helping save the planet, it's a small price to pay. Director Josh Tickell holds a jar of bio-diesel ijn front of his ""Veggie Van."" ""An Inconvenient Truth"" gave us shocking revelations about the problem of global warming. Now one film offers the solution. So starts the trailer to Tickell's new film ""FUEL,"" which charts the history of oil dependency in the United States, examines the current energy crisis and, most importantly, how you and I can change how we source and use energy. The premise might sound a bit preachy and be a turn off for those experiencing green fatigue, but Tickell's motivations for pursuing this direction warrant closer inspection. The 34-year-old grew up in an oil-refining area in the American state of Louisiana. Within a 100-mile radius of his childhood home there are 150 petrol-chemical facilities. ""I watched many members of my family get sick from that pollution,"" Tickell told CNN. ""My mother had nine miscarriages. So from quite a young age I was affected by that and I really had the desire to go out and find other ways of making energy."" And it wasn't just the miscarriages his mother experienced that encouraged Tickell to look to alternative fuels. Many of his family, he said, have either died or had problems with cancer. ""The average oil refinery,"" Tickell said, ""pumps out a cocktail of about 8,000 chemical combinations. Less than 50 of them have been studied. But the majority of the ones which have are cancer causing."" His upbringing in Louisiana led Tickell to start using bio-diesel, way before anyone was really talking about it as a serious alternative. He bought himself an old 1986 diesel-powered Winnebago which he christened the ""Veggie Van."" ""For me, it was like what Don Quixote's horse would have been for him,"" he said. His travels across America unearthed a genuine curiosity in bio-diesel (made from cooking oil). He began lecturing on the subject and started traveling the world in search of new energy technologies. Armed with a masters in film studies -- to go with his degree in sustainable living -- Tickell set about piecing his story together for a wider audience. The result is a compelling piece of environmental film-making which won the audience award for best documentary at the Sundance Film Festival. But despite this rapturous reception, audience feedback prompted Tickell to re-edit the film incorporating many more alternative energies. The new cut of ""FUEL"" was officially launched in U.S. cinemas earlier this month. Tickell hopes that people will walk out of the cinema feeling empowered. ""I distinguish that from inspiration or hope,"" he said. ""I think empowerment means people can start a new dialogue with a new set of concepts and information. Even if you think you know about these subjects, you'll watch the movie and have a completely different perspective and understanding of the issues."" Tickell persuaded a host of celebrities to contribute to his film including Richard Branson, comedian Larry David and musician Sheryl Crow. Branson has been particularly supportive of both Tickell and the film's producer Rebecca Harrell. The UK entrepreneur has given ""FUEL"" his backing as well as supporting curriculumhub.com -- the world's first ever open source national green educational curriculum. ""It's much more than just a green curriculum"" Harrell said. ""Any subject can be uploaded by teachers and shared with students all over the world."" The Web site was launched in New York this week after Tickell and Harrell had traveled from California in the algae-fueled car which they have dubbed ""The Algaeus"". The web site also allows visitors to download a 35-minute educational cut of ""FUEL."" Sadly, ""FUEL"" is only showing in a handful of cinemas in the U.S. right now, but Harrell is confident that the film -- which she says cost around $6 million to make -- will soon reach a wider audience. And next year she hopes the film will be showing in cinemas across Europe. The whole project has been a labor of love in more ways than one for both Tickell and Harrell who had a meeting of minds when they first met six years ago. The pair plan to marry on January 1 next year.","""FUEL"" examines the energy crisis and what the alternatives to oil are .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to believe another year is coming to end. Where on earth did 2013 go? While we try to answer that question, we're thinking about the year that was -- and all the stories that inspired us, those that made us crazy and those we couldn't stop talking to our friends about -- on and offline. We put our list together based on those stories that resonated the most on CNN.com and in social media -- the 20 stories that seemed to spark the biggest conversations among women this year. (Click on our gallery above to see them all!) No surprise that Miley Cyrus tops our list. If the former Disney star's goal was to be one of the most talked about women of 2013, she arguably succeeded. Her twerking at the MTV Video Music Awards (full disclosure -- I didn't know what twerking was until the VMAs!) followed by her nearly nude performance in a video for her single ""Wrecking Ball"" got tongues wagging all over the country. Will Miley continue to shock in 2014? We'll be watching! PHOTOS: 2013: The year in pictures . Other women who generated some heated debate this year include Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook chief operating officer whose book ""Lean In"" became an immediate best-seller. But was Sandberg, a mom of two, accusing women of not being ambitious enough or not doing enough to put more cracks in the glass ceiling, many women asked this year? Many women criticized Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer for banning working from home, and for donning a designer dress and stiletto heels in a sexy pose for Vogue magazine. I sided with others who asked: Why can't a woman be smart and beautiful and sexy? The sexualization of girls was another big topic in 2013 illuminated not just by Cyrus but by media outlets counting the days until Kendall Jenner, one of the youngest members of the Kardashian clan, turned 18. ""There is a countdown clock waiting for a girl to turn 18 so they can (ogle) her more inappropriately then they already do,"" reader Jodi Ferich said on CNN's Facebook page. ""I think it's a valid question about the appropriateness of waiting for a young lady to age so you can objectify her as a sex object."" There were many inspiring moments this year for women, too, such as that Dove ad campaign, which went viral, showcasing our inability as women to see just how beautiful we are. One of our favorite ads ever, about a fictional place called 'Camp Gyno,' took the Internet by storm. In the ad, a tween is the first girl to get her period at camp, what she calls her ""red badge of courage,"" and proudly sets out to teach her pals about this milestone. We were inspired by celebrities too, such as Katy Perry whose ""Roar"" video motivated a 16-year-old Toronto girl named Olivia Wise with an inoperable brain tumor to do her own version. Two months after Wise recorded her ""Roar"" video, which brings me to tears every single time I watch it, she died. Perry took to Twitter, telling her 48 million followers (she bumped Justin Bieber from the top spot on Twitter this year) that Wise's strength and spirit inspired her and so many others. And how could we not mention Batkid, the 5-year-old leukemia patient from San Francisco? He won the hearts of people around the world when he joined Batman fighting crime in a made-up Gotham city as part of a wish granted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. PHOTOS: The year in entertainment . There were big debates among parents, too. The documentary ""Blackfish,"" showcased on CNN, prompted families to discuss whether to take their kids to SeaWorld. The question of whether schools go too far in enforcing zero tolerance policies also came up after a 17-year-old who hugged a teacher and a 6-year-old who kissed a fellow first grader were suspended for sexual harassment. Some relatively unknown women were thrust into the national spotlight this year. Wendy Davis, a Texas state senator, became a hero to women abortion rights supporters when she staged a dramatic 11-hour filibuster. Huma Abedin, the wife of the former New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, also got women talking for her decision to stick with her husband after his second bout with sexting and reports that she blamed herself for his indiscretions. And there were definitely some lighter moments that we women loved to dish about, from Michelle Obama's bangs (yes, they really generated a ton of conversation!) to the arrival of Prince George with Kate Middleton showing the world that contrary to what you see in Hollywood, women do actually have a post-baby belly right after giving birth. I always love these opportunities to look back and showcase the issues and stories that really struck a chord with us. We just must might be talking about them again next year. Until then, can we go back to that question from the top -- where did 2013 go?

"(CNN) -- The jury in the trial of former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards is deliberating six counts stemming from allegations that he accepted illegal campaign contributions, falsified documents and conspired to receive and conceal the contributions. The maximum sentence if convicted on all six counts would be 30 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine. Here is a breakdown of the charges against Edwards: . Opinion: Are men stupid? Count 1: Conspiracy (maximum 5-year sentence) Edwards, a former U.S. senator from North Carolina, is accused of conspiring to receive and conceal contributions in excess of the allowed limits from Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon and Fred Baron, a now-deceased Texas lawyer who was Edwards' finance chairman. Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, the most an individual could contribute to any candidate in 2008 was $2,300 in the primary election and $2,300 in the general election. Prosecutors argued that Edwards, while a candidate for federal office, accepted $725,000 from Mellon and more than $200,000 from Baron. Counts 2-5 reflect that accusation. Count 2: Illegal campaign contributions (maximum 5-year sentence) Edwards is accused of receiving contributions from Mellon in excess of federal limits in 2007.

"(CNN) -- Is it really possible that our century long love affair with the automobile is coming to an end? Are we really falling out of love with our cars? At the FutureCast debate last month the most surprising discussion of the evening focused on the crisis of our car culture. Speaker after speaker noted the younger generation's lack of passion about cars. Some even said that young people no longer have any interest in driving. ""I think the biggest disruption we are going to see is the drop in driver's licensing among young people, said Doug Newcomb, former editor of Road and Track Road Gear. ""I think we are really seeing a big shift in America's love affair with the car. I talk to most young people... they are not interested in driving."" Part of the explanation may lie in the latest driving technology. According to Paul Nunes, Director of Research at the Accenture Institute for High Performance, automatic transmission has killed the car. Read more: From flying cars to shared vehicles . ""A lot of young people don't have an interest in driving because they have no idea what it means to drive,"" Nunes said. The end of our love affair with cars seems to be an international phenomenon.

""I don't even have a driver's license,"" confessed Jahan Khanna, the 25 year-old co-founder and CTO of the car-sharing network Sidecar. ""The interesting thing is that cars are expensive and you rarely, rarely use them, and when you do use them, you use them inefficiently and most of the time you are driving them, you are looking for a place to park,"" Khanna explained.

"(CNN) -- John Edwards walked out of a courtroom Thursday a free man. How long will it take women attracted by the flame of celebrity -- even ill-gotten -- to date him? And believe they can convert him to monogamy? The former Democratic presidential hopeful's affair with Rielle Hunter and the subsequent cover-up led to six counts carrying a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine. Federal prosecutors argued that Edwards knowingly violated campaign finance laws by accepting large contributions from Rachel Mellon and Fred Baron to support Hunter and their child, and keep the affair under wraps. WTVD: Juror had no intention of flirting with Edwards . A federal jury in North Carolina acquitted him on one count of violating campaign finance law Thursday and deadlocked on the five other counts against him. Prosecutors may still decide to retry him. Politicians like Edwards and Newt Gingrich and celebrities like Ashton Kutcher and Jesse James seem to have no trouble attracting new girlfriends after public accusations of cheating. Opinion: Edwards jury got it exactly right . It's always possible that people who have cheated in the past will not cheat in the future. But relationship experts say past behavior is a better predictor of the future than any cheater's promises. ""Denial can be really powerful in new relationships,"" said divorce recovery expert Andra Brosh, co-founder of Divorce Detox in Santa Monica, California. ""People use it as a defense against knowing the truth. They don't look at all the facts, and ultimately, that ends up being a problem."" Flattery works wonders . Cheaters are usually unsatisfied about something in their lives, experts say, or they wouldn't stray. But it's not always clear whether they're truly unhappy with their partners or about something they can't fix in themselves. Rarely does the cheater take responsibility for his (or her) life and getting out of it honorably. The spouses generally get the blame. The reputation of Elizabeth Edwards, who separated from John Edwards in 2010 after 32 years of marriage and died of cancer in 2010, seemed to be on trial at times. A full participant in her husband's presidential campaign, she could be tough and blunt with campaign staffers. After reports surfaced of the affair, a witness testified, Elizabeth Edwards confronted her husband and ripped off her blouse to show her mastectomy scars. ""You don't see me anymore,"" former staffer Christina Reynolds quoted her as saying. Edwards charges: The rundown . ""I've worked with countless people like this, and it's always the same,"" writes Mira Kirshenbaum, author of ""I Love You But I Don't Trust You,"" a book about rebuilding trust in relationships, in an e-mail. ""The cheater says, 'My spouse is fat/stupid/mean/boring/whatever (insert adjective) and I need someone who is skinny/smart/nice/interesting/opposite-of-whatever. You are skinny/smart/nice/interesting/opposite-of-whatever. So we can be happy forever.' "" The cheater's flattery can be intoxicating, convincing the other person that he or she is special and protected from being cheated on in the future. ""They think they're special because they've been told they're special, and they want to believe it,"" Kirshenbaum said. ""It's not that people don't think. It's that flattery and excitement short-circuit thought. "" And an ABCNews.com report that a juror might have been flirting with Edwards drew a lot of attention. Edwards flirting? Quelle surprise. Can cheaters change? Of course, many cheaters can change if they have the desire. Much has been made of Callista Gingrich, who had an affair with Gingrich while he was married to his second wife, helping her husband convert to Catholicism. It's possible that Gingrich may stay faithful, if for no other reason than the 24-news cycle means public figures are being constantly scrutinized for evidence of bad behavior. Why politicians lie and why we want to believe them . Affairs with married men or women are a high-risk gamble, says Lawrence Josephs, an Adelphi University psychology professor. Look at the evidence: Cheating is how he or she has chosen to solve relationship problems. ""When you win such a man, you are winning someone who feels entitled to have his cake and eat it too and then lie about it,"" Josephs said. So Callista Gingrich or any future Edwards girlfriend shouldn't assume she can change the cheater or that he will be different with her because she's so special. Their love, and his belief in God or occupancy of the White House, will not keep anyone faithful if he doesn't want to be or can't be faithful. (Former President Bill Clinton proved that point.) Questions to ask . It is possible for people in decent marriages to fall in love outside the marriage, but it's important to carefully assess whether the couple can get beyond the fantasy to the reality of love. ""I would try to look carefully at the (cheater's) motivation and see what you feel is genuinely true between the two of us,"" said Susan Piver, author of ""The Wisdom of a Broken Heart."" ""Do you admire their character otherwise? Do you feel loved and seen as you are?"" There needs to be some recognition that your relationship isn't a perfect replacement of an imperfect marriage. ""A question to ask yourself is, 'Does my relationship include difficulty?' "" Piver recommended. ""Are there things that bug me about this person? If there aren't, that would send up a red flag for me."" If they seem only motivated by ambition or simply looking for brighter horizons, ""delete them from your Facebook account and move on,"" she says.","John Edwards stood trial on accusations of violating campaign finance laws .

"(CNN) -- Two of the most experienced sides in the World Cup face off against each other Tuesday, including the host Brazil, the only country never to have missed a World Cup. Brazil's match against Mexico will be the South American giant's 99th match since the tournament began in 1930. But Mexico's players are no slouches. This is the 15th time the country has made it to the World Cup, putting it fourth behind Brazil (20 times), Italy and Germany (18 each), and Argentina (16). The game against Brazil will be its 51st Cup match. Belgium begins its 2014 campaign Tuesday, hoping to improve on its previous 11 appearances, when it has averaged only 1.28 goals per game. The team will be optimistic facing Algeria, which has appeared in three previous World Cups and never made it beyond the group stage. (Belgium did defeat Germany and Chile in the group stage in 1982, but was eliminated in the away-goals tiebreaker.) Algeria hasn't won a World Cup match since defeating Chile in 1982 and hasn't scored in its last five matches. Russia and South Korea are the final two teams to make their 2014 debuts, playing the last match of the day Tuesday. Russia is on a winning streak, not having lost in the last 10 matches it has played, counting both qualifying matches and friendlies. But South Korea has won the first game it played in each of the last three World Cups. Tuesday's matches follow what should have been an exciting clash of the titans Germany and Portugal. But it turned out to be a lopsided match dominated by one giant: Germany's Thomas Muller. Not only did he score the first hat trick of the 2014 tournament, but he has now scored eight goals in his World Cup career, putting him level with legends like Diego Maradona. But while it took the Argentine legend 21 matches to score eight goals, it's taken Muller only seven. Only 20 players in World Cup history have scored more than eight goals. American Clint Dempsey helped Team USA beat Ghana for the first time and scored the fifth-fastest goal in World Cup history in the process. Dempsey found the net only 29 seconds into the match, but Hakan Sukur of Turkey seems to be in no danger of being dethroned as the fastest scorer in tournament history. He scored only 11 seconds into a match against South Korea in 2002, helping Turkey to a third-place tournament finish over the co-hosts. And while Iranians might have been disappointed with a 0-0 draw against Nigeria on Monday, the game did set a record for Iran -- it's the first time in World Cup history that its players have kept their opponents from scoring. It was their 10th World Cup match. They've won one, tied three and lost six. Nigeria has reason to be less pleased with Monday's result. It has now gone nine World Cup matches without a win.

Sukkarieh points proudly to a line that would normally denote her son's sect. But on this historic, yet flimsy little square of paper, it's been very deliberately left blank. That may sound easy, but in a country of 18 different faiths spread amongst less than five million people, it was anything but. Lebanon's government relies heavily on a sectarian political balance to maintain a very tentative peace. It's a system that always seems fraught with peril for its population. Ghadi, whose name in Arabic means ""my future"", isn't old enough to worry yet. His parents dream of a future where he'll never have to. Sukkarieh, a Sunni Muslim, and her husband Nidal Darwish, who is Shiite, never wanted a religious wedding ceremony. But civil marriages aren't legal in Lebanon. Committed as much to each other as they were to their cause, Sukkarieh and Darwish took on political and religious leaders -- fighting a two-year battle from engagement onward in order to become the first couple to be granted a civil marriage license in Lebanon. Amidst the country's confessional system of governance, one whose politics have become more fractured as its sectarian lines have grown deeper, it looked on many occasions like they might not win out. But despite strong opposition and multiple threats, they persevered. The law still hasn't been changed but momentum is now growing to change it. Sukkarieh and Darwish's marriage license was approved last April, and they haven't stopped pushing the envelope since. But in Lebanon, where religion can mean the difference between life and death, love and birth aren't always celebrated. ""Somebody talked to me on Facebook,"" Sukkarieh tells me, ""and said 'I will turn your baby into blood because he's an illegal baby' based on his point of view ... saying 'you won't see him growing up -- you will see him killed some day between your hands.'"" It's difficult to imagine how anyone could see Ghadi as a threat, yet sectarian tensions have long existed in this country -- one that experienced a brutal 15-year civil war, and one that is being drawn deeper every day into another civil war in neighboring Syria. Just last week, two suicide bombs rocked Beirut. Over the summer, dozens were killed in blasts targeting both Sunni and Shiite strongholds throughout the country. It's no wonder Darwish is so fearful for his family. ""It's very hard because, when Kholoud and I started down this path, we got threats, but it didn't make a difference to us, we were proud of what we were doing and the steps we were taking,"" he says. ""But since Ghadi arrived we've started to feel scared."" The family that wants to change Lebanon may now have to leave it. As they consider relocating, they grow sadder and more worried. ""You end up living a life of fear,"" says Darwish. ""I just constantly want to protect Kholoud and Ghadi,"" he adds, ""hold them close and not let them go."" ""We are trying now to apply for immigration somewhere else where we can be protected as human beings and [where we can keep] our human and civil rights,"" Sukkarieh says. This is the sad reality of Lebanon: A beautiful baby whose arrival was meant to bring hope may now need to depart a divided country that could use that hope more than ever.","Lebanese parents refuse to mark baby's sect on birth certificate .
Parents have received threats in Lebanon, a country deeply divided on sectarian lines .

"(CNN) -- A dry and mild spring led Don Villwock, like all of Indiana's corn and soybean farmers, to plant two weeks early this year. He was hopeful for a bountiful Labor Day harvest. But the rain didn't fall and June brought blistering heat. Now, as punishing drought grips the Midwest, Villwock, 61, walks his hard-hit 4,000 acres in southwest Indiana in utter dismay. Where there should have been tall, dark green, leafy plants, there now stand corn stalks that are waist high or, at best, chest high. They are pale in color and spindly. Fragile. Tired. Pull back an ear's husk and you find no kernels, he says. With temperatures rising above 95 degrees, the pollen starts to die. ""It's emotionally draining,"" he said. ""The crop got out of the ground very well. We were so optimistic. But maybe a few of us were counting our eggs before they were hatched."" The costs of America's worst drought in 24 years is obvious to Villwock, who has been farming for four decades. They are not so apparent to American consumers -- at least, not yet. But down the line, people are certain to be paying more for food this year. Authorities have declared more than 1,000 counties in 26 states as natural disaster areas. A county is generally qualified as a natural disaster area if it has suffered severe drought for eight consecutive weeks. Farmers are then eligible for low-interest emergency loans from the Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency. Is the drought hitting your area? Let us know how you're coping on CNN iReport. As of Tuesday, 61% of land in the lower 48 states was experiencing drought conditions -- stretching from Nevada to South Carolina -- the highest percentage in the 12-year record of the U.S. Drought Monitor. The parched conditions come after some areas of the United States suffered record-setting heat waves, killer storms and blazing wildfires. In America's Corn Belt, the prognosis for farmers is grim as fields and pastures become drier by the day. Villwock says the drought is already larger in scope than in 1988, and he fears it will intensify to become worse. Many areas in the southern Midwest are reporting the poorest conditions for June since 1988. Corn prices pop after lower production forecast . ""In the hottest areas last week, which were generally dry, crop conditions deteriorated quickly,"" writes Rich Tinker, author of the Drought Monitor. He says 30% of the corn crop in the 18 primary corn-growing states is now in poor or very poor condition, up from 22% the previous week. Half of America's pastures and ranges are in poor or very poor condition, up from 28% in mid-June, he says. Think it's hot? Imagine living here . The sizzling conditions have also led to a dramatic increase in wildfire activity since mid-June, shortly after the High Park Fire ignited near Fort Collins, Colorado. During the past three weeks, acres scorched by wildfires went up from 1.1 million to 3.1 million. The past 12 months have been the warmest the United States has experienced since the dawn of record-keeping in 1895, the National Climatic Data Center said earlier this week. In Indiana, with water reservoirs at low levels, a mandatory water ban began Friday at noon in Indianapolis in hopes of saving an additional 25 million gallons a day. The ban mainly affects lawn watering. At Bilskie's Market in Indianapolis, owner Jim Bilskie says he has offered customers local produce for 40 years. This year, he's paying more for fruits and vegetables and says he has to pass on the costs. ""The cost is high now,"" Bilskie told CNN affiliate WTHR. ""The wholesaler isn't making money. The cost is going up. We're not making money. It's outrageous."" Mother nature's kill list . Iowa farmer Dave Miller, 60, has not seen rain in 21 days. His corn looked good until about two weeks ago when the soaring temperatures turned killer. ""I'm about 50 percent short of needed moisture,"" he said. ""In parts of southern Indiana, southern Illinois, they have been much drier for a longer period. We looked good, compared to them."" At this stage, Miller needs 2 inches of rain right away to carry his corn crop as well as his soybeans, which will start aborting pods without adequate moisture. It will be challenging for many farmers, who often pay $800 to $1,000 per acre to plant a crop. Consumers will be hurting as well down the line when they feel the drought in their pocketbooks, says Miller, who is also the director of research and commodity services at the Iowa Farm Bureau. Corn prices have climbed 45% already, Miller says; soybeans, 22%. ""In the short run, that doesn't show up in the grocery store,"" he said, since most of this corn is used as livestock feed. In fact, he said, meat prices could fall at first if farmers slaughter more animals to decrease the cost of buying feed. But eventually, Americans will pay more at the checkout counter. ""It's likely that in three to six months from now, you will start seeing an increase in prices in the meat case,"" Miller said. ""There will be a quicker impact on eggs and poultry because the production cycle is shorter."" And even milk could see 4% to 6% price hikes if there are reductions in dairy herds. Villwock, the Indiana farmer, says he must wait now until the fall of 2013 before he can hope for a full harvest. Harsh weather affects everyone, but farmers are especially at the whim of Mother Nature, he says. Meanwhile in Iowa, the forecast Friday included a 30% chance of rain, filling many hearts with hope. But last time Miller checked his radar, not one drop had fallen on his 350 acres.

"(Health.com) -- If you're genetically predisposed to be overweight, the amount of sleep you get each night could make a big difference in how influential those genes are, a new study suggests. After analyzing the sleep habits and body weight of 1,088 pairs of twins, including genetically identical ones, researchers concluded that people who get plenty of sleep -- at least nine hours per night -- have more control over their weight through their behavior than people who sleep less. Among twins who slept less than seven hours per night, genes accounted for 70% of the differences in body mass index (BMI), while so-called environmental factors, such as diet and exercise habits, were responsible for just 4% of the differences. The pattern was reversed among twins who slept nine or more hours per night. In this group, environmental factors accounted for 51% of BMI differences and genes accounted for just 32%. Health.com: How much sleep do you really need? Getting adequate sleep, in other words, appears to dampen genetic risk and allow the influence of diet, exercise, and other controllable lifestyle factors to ""surface,"" the researchers say. ""The less you sleep, the more important genetic factors are to how much you weigh,"" says lead author Nathaniel F. Watson, M.D., co-director of the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Center, in Seattle. ""The longer you sleep, the greater the influence of environmental factors like meal composition and timing."" Previous research has found that too little sleep is associated with a higher BMI, but many of those studies haven't been able to entirely rule out the possibility that genes, or complicating factors such as sleep disorders, are partly responsible for the link. Twin studies, by contrast, allow researchers to tease out the complex relationship between genes and environment. Identical twins share the exact same DNA, so most differences in weight can be attributed to environment rather than genes. And fraternal twins, though genetically dissimilar, tend to share the same background and risk factors. (All of the twins in the study, both identical and fraternal, were raised in the same household.) Health.com: 7 tips for the best sleep ever . The new study, which appears in the journal SLEEP, suggests that ""the amount of sleep you get has an effect on your gene expression,"" says Michael Weissberg, M.D., a sleep specialist and professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, in Denver. Researchers have identified more than 20 genes that are linked to obesity risk through their effects on appetite, blood sugar (glucose) metabolism, and other channels, but it's not clear which specific genes were at play in the study. ""Based on previous research, it's probably related to glucose metabolism, metabolism in general, inflammation -- all pathways that we already know are associated with obesity,"" Watson says. Health.com: Surprising health benefits of sleep . Sleep deprivation puts stress on your body, and that stress could help explain the relationship between sleep and gene expression seen in the study, says Carl Boethel, M.D., director of the Sleep Institute at Scott & White Healthcare, in Temple, Texas. ""When you are constantly depriving yourself of sleep, you are keeping yourself in a state of stress, and the genes that encode for that stressful environment start saying, 'I need to hold on to calories,'"" Boethel says. The study doesn't answer the question of whether you can ""sleep yourself thin,"" Watson says, but it does highlight the importance of adequate sleep to overall health. ""We spend so much time in this country trying to keep our weight down with diet and exercise, but we never think about sleep,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Former model Charlotte Collard sashayed down the catwalks and graced the covers of magazines around the world, until she decided to use her inside knowledge of the fashion industry to launch e-commerce platform SoYouThinkYouCanShop. Here the mother of three girls, who is also a GIA certified gemologist, shares her insights on the future of online shopping and talks about her transition from a model to a businesswoman. Watch out for Collard at Paris Fashion Week, where she is Tweeting and Instagramming behind the scenes exclusively for CNN. CNN: Why did you switch career from being a model to a fashion writer and now entrepreneur? Charlotte Collard: I wouldn't say that I changed my career, but more that I took it to the next level. Modeling has given me the opportunity to travel and learn about business from an early age, and that experience has helped me become an entrepreneur. It all started with a blog in 2009 where I put together various looks and photographed them, and then Net-a-Porter gave me the opportunity to sell clothes through an affiliation system. It made me realize the potential online and SoYouThinkYouCanShop became a commercial platform. I also studied gemology to gain a deeper knowledge of exclusive markets, as at the time many fashion brands were launching their own jewelry lines. CNN: What have been the greatest challenges you've faced in the transition? CC: As a model, people have preconceived ideas of you, and you have to fight them to gain credibility. But that can also be a good thing, because it pushes you to work harder and prove yourself more. You might need more time for people to take you seriously, but once you succeed you know that you're fully prepared to operate on that level. CNN: What advice would you give to someone changing careers in the way you've done? CC: Think about what you have done in the past, and start something based on what you have experienced and learned. If you want to make a drastic career change, consider what your passion is. Today, to be successful you must be professional, but also patient and persistent. You need to know what you are never willing to give up. Ask yourself - if this job wouldn't pay anything, would I be able to do it every day for a long time? If the answer is yes, then you have found your passion. CNN: How do you see consumer behavior changing over the next decade? How will shopping be different? CC: The financial crisis has made people think more about the way they spend their money. They want to invest in lasting pieces which won't go out of fashion. I have always selected garments for my website according to that principle -- elegant clothes with a modern touch, which are wardrobe staples. CNN: Do you think there will still be a role for high-street clothes shopping in the future? CC: I believe that we need both markets: virtual and physical. People shop online because it saves them time, they don't have to worry about opening hours, or maybe they can't find what they are looking for in shops. It gives them a certain ""shopping freedom"", but not everybody knows how things will fit them based on a picture from an e-boutique, no matter how detailed it may be. This is why at SoYouThinkYouCanShop we offer our clients services such as online personal shopping. CNN: How easy is it for new designers to find an audience these days compared to previous years? CC: I think it's becoming harder and harder. So many designers are coming out of schools trying to launch their own brands, and it's hard for them to stand out from the crowd. Once they have found their brand identity it isn't over, they have to be able to keep it fresh and renew it for every collection - almost four times a year. This is why I am so impressed with designers that have been in fashion for decades, and have managed to reinvent themselves without losing what identifies them. CNN: Has the Internet improved exposure for those who are up-and-coming? CC: Of course! Internet is the best way to communicate, it offers easy access to up-and-coming designers, and social networks help them go beyond the constraints of a studio and show-off their work to a global audience. Good or bad advertising, it doesn't matter, as long as it spreads the news and people remember you and your work. CNN: How important are events like Paris Fashion Week for designers? What opportunities are there after a good show? CC: Fashion weeks are extremely important for designers. They are an opportunity to impress the most important people in the fashion media, whose reports will influence department store buyers and potential customers. A fashion show is not only about designing garments of clothing, it's about inviting an audience into your world and showing your vision through a collection.","Charlotte Collard is a former model turned entrepreneur .

"(CNN) -- Inventor Nikola Tesla may have died alone and broke, but he has powerful friends who want to preserve his legacy. Cartoonist Matthew Inman, the brain behind ""The Oatmeal,"" is one. Using his popular web comic, Inman launched an effort to turn Tesla's former laboratory in Shoreham, New York, into a museum. Tesla, who lived from 1856 to 1943, developed the basis for AC power, among other ideas and innovations that have shaped our lives. He obtained more than 100 patents, according to the Tesla Memorial Society of New York. Inman partnered with the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, a nonprofit group, to generate widespread interest in a museum. The cartoonist sang the inventor's praises in a humorous, profane comic hailing Tesla as superior to the better-known Thomas Edison (""Basically, Tesla = Nicest. Inventor. EVER,"" Inman wrote). Through the crowdfunding website Indiegogo, the nonprofit and Inman stirred up more than $1.3 million in 2012, when the facility and land were put up for sale. That was enough money to save the property, but not quite what was needed to renovate it for an actual museum. From grains of 'Oatmeal,' big things for cartoonist . So this week Inman turned to a man who has become a household name in his own right: Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, which is named for the inventor. Inman published an Oatmeal comic called ""What it's like to own a Tesla Model S,"" bursting with enthusiasm about owning the electric car, and then appealed to Musk in a second installment. ""Elon Musk, if you're reading this: You owe us nothing, and you've done nothing but good things in the name of Nikola Tesla,"" Inman wrote in his endearing handwriting-esque typeface. ""But the fact remains: Tesla Motors, a company now worth billions, is using Nikola Tesla's name and they're using his technology, and all we want in return is a little bit of help."" Inman wrote that automobiles have AC induction motors and bear the Tesla name, despite the fact that no one from Nikola Tesla's family was involved in founding the car company. According to the Tesla Memorial Society of New York, Nikola Tesla invented the AC induction motor, which he sold to Westinghouse in 1888. ""But the idea of a car company using someone else's family name without any formal connection to them is a slightly arresting notion,"" Inman wrote. ""It would be like naming a company 'Steve Jobs Hoverbikes' 50 years from now, regardless of any ties to Apple or Jobs himself."" During the initial fundraiser for the museum, Musk donated $2,500, Inman wrote. But what the Tesla Museum would need to open, he said, is another jolt of $8 million. Inman tweeted Tuesday ""@elonmusk I wrote a review of my Model S, and then asked you for a little favor here [link]."" To the delight of many Twitter users, Musk tweeted back: ""@Oatmeal I would be happy to help."" Of course, we don't know if ""help"" means the full $8 million or much less. Musk's Tesla Motors declined to say how much Musk would donate. But for fans of Tesla's work and legacy, the possibility is electrifying. Elizabeth Landau is on Twitter at @lizlandau .

"Danielle Holley-Walker is a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law and is actively supporting the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama. Danielle Holley-Walker: Media's features on African-American women voters are missing the point. (CNN) -- You can't turn on a 24-hour news channel or your nightly news this week without seeing a feature on African-American women voters. It makes sense, being that the South Carolina Democratic primary is only one day away and African-American women will make up approximately one-third of the voters. The angle in these news features is virtually identical. The commentators wonder and marvel at the extraordinarily difficult choice for African-American women in this primary -- will we vote for the woman candidate or the African-American candidate? Reporters have been busying themselves traveling to crowded beauty shops all over the state to answer this question. The funniest, or perhaps most disturbing, thing about these stories is how far they are from my reality. I am an African-American woman living in South Carolina. I have African-American women family members and friends who live in this state. I actually visit beauty shops to get my hair done. Never once have I heard a single woman I know frame the choice about whom to vote for as a question of gender or racial politics. So what are African-American women talking about when the cameras aren't watching or, more importantly, what are we telling the media that is not being fairly reported? African-American women are talking about the issues! We talk about the vision that each candidate has for leading this country. We enthusiastically discuss the possibility that real, positive change will come from this election. We even parse the policy distinctions in the candidates' positions on education, creating jobs and ending the war in Iraq. Sometimes, the issues we talk about do deal with aspects of gender and racial identity. We debated Sen. Hillary Clinton's statement implying that Martin Luther King's civil rights movement did not fulfill its promise until Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. We argue and marvel at the significant generational divide in the African-American community that is being exposed by this election process. If you listen closely to the women in the news features at the beauty shops, they are commenting on these issues, even when the voice-over in the same feature is telling you that the women are discussing whether it's more important to have the first woman or the first black president. Why is the media determined to make us choose? Why do they insist that we declare our loyalty to either women or to African-Americans? This is a truly false dichotomy in that we are the living, breathing embodiment of both identities. Asking us to prefer our gender over our race (or vice versa) is the equivalent of asking us to prefer one vital organ over another. That is not to say that identity politics are completely irrelevant in this election. African-American women are expressing their pride in both candidates and in the progress this country has made that allows a white woman and an African-American man to be strong contenders for the presidency. My mother is uplifted by the idea that Obama's candidacy means that her two grandsons will grow up being able to realistically dream about being president. On Saturday, we will carry this pride into the voting booth with us, but when we cast our votes, we will be thinking about the serious issues facing this country. That's the truth, and don't let the media tell you otherwise. E-mail to a friend .","Holley-Walker: Race-or-gender choice is driven by media, not reality .

"(CNN) -- Land of the free. Home of the brave. Bastion of mediocre Internet speeds. Already getting clobbered by countries like South Korea and Japan, the United States is close to falling out of the top 10 nations in terms of Internet-connection speeds, according to a new report. The United States fell from 8th to 9th after being passed by Sweden in the first quarter of this year, according to networking firm Akamai's quarterly State of the Internet report. Akamai handles about one-third of the world's Web traffic. The other countries with quicker Web connections than the United States? Hong Kong, Switzerland, Netherlands, Latvia and the Czech Republic. Why Internet connections are fastest in South Korea . The slip comes despite average U.S. speeds going up 27% from the same time last year, according to Akamai. In some ways, the United States is at a disadvantage when it comes to fast connections. Its sprawling size and hefty population can make building efficient broadband networks a challenge. But critics argue that a relative lack of competition among service providers also hurts. Susan Crawford, a tech policy analyst and professor at Cardozo Law School in New York City, argues that Internet access should be a public utility like gas, electricity and water because it has become just as essential. In her book, ""Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly in the New Guilded Age,"" she says a lack of regulation in the Unites States has allowed a small number of companies to dominate the broadband market, meaning consumers have fewer choices and pay higher prices. ""In Seoul, when you move into an apartment, you have a choice of three or four providers selling you symmetric fiber access for $30 per month, and installation happens in one day,"" Crawford told TIME earlier this year. ""That's unthinkable in the United States. And the idea that the country that invented the Internet can't get online is beyond my imagination."" Akamai reported that the average Web connection in the United States was 8.6 megabits per second. South Korea's average was 14.2 megabits per second. Of course, some folks in the United States have it better than others. In some regions of the country, residents still don't even have basic connections to high-speed Internet. But if you live or work in Vermont, you're in pretty good shape. Average speeds there are 12.7 megabits per second -- meaning connections in the Green Mountain State are, on average, faster than Japan's. Looking for speedy Internet elsewhere in the U.S.? New Hampshire, Delaware, the District of Columbia and Utah round out the top five spots.","Report says United States has 9th-fastest Internet speed in the world .

"(CNN) -- Thinking of treating your sweetheart to a fragrant bouquet this Valentine's Day? Think again. When it comes to smelling the roses, most sold in U.S. supermarkets and flower shops have no scent, or at least none of their own. Amy Stewart bemoans the lack of fragrance. ""When a fragrant flower like a rose loses its scent, it has lost the thing that makes it a rose,"" said Stewart, author of ""Flower Confidential."" The book chronicles how a sustained effort to create sturdy flowers ended up inadvertently creating flowers without a scent. The international flower market works on a massive scale and ships flowers thousands of miles around the world. This means consumers in the United States can buy lilies in the dead of winter. It also created a market where the majority of roses sold in the United States come from Colombia, so they're bred to be affordable and long-lasting, often at the expense of fragrance, Stewart said. ""It might be a week or two before it gets to you,"" she said. ""You are trying to breed a flower that will last a long time so that it can survive on the airplane and on the truck and the train and in the flower shop."" In addition to using chemicals and refrigeration, companies also tinker with genetics to engineer flowers that last longer. ""Fragrance just got bred out along the way and a lot of these long-lasting flowers have no fragrance at all. "" Not all flowers are bereft of scent. Hyacinths, narcissus, daffodils and lilacs have yet to experience a lot of tinkering from the flower industry, she said. But the rose, America's most popular flower, stands out, in part because the flowers used to have an evocative fragrance. Indeed, Stewart said, many people still sniff roses hoping for an aroma; what they likely smell is a combination of chlorophyll and fillers used at flower shops. In other words, the smell of decay, she said. There's cause for hope, Stewart said. Big flower companies have begun trying to breed the scent back in, hoping to offer consumers a pretty rose that smells good and is hardy enough to survive the journey from the fields to the store.","Most flowers sold in U.S. supermarkets and flower shops have no scent, author says .

"(CNN)  -- When Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered her oath last summer, many women -- and especially Latinas -- felt renewed hope as a champion of women's rights took her place on the U.S. Supreme Court. With Democrats in the White House and both houses of Congress, we believed that we could stop playing defense and actually advance women's rights, including access to abortion. However, the health care debate quickly convinced us that we had to mobilize. First, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, crafted the Stupak-Pitts amendment, designed to restrict women's access to abortion coverage in the proposed public health insurance marketplace. Millions of women who have access to abortion coverage through their insurance plans would lose this coverage if the insurance plans were offered in the exchange. We were told that women could use their own money to buy an abortion rider in advance: Women would have to plan for an unplanned pregnancy. An abortion can range in cost from several hundred dollars to thousands of dollars for a ""threatened"" pregnancy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi allowed the amendment to move forward in the House health care bill out of fear that opponents would use abortion politics to tank health care reform. Within weeks, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, offered a near-exact model of the Stupak bill in the Senate. After the push for the Stupak amendment, characterized by backroom dealings among elected officials and reported pressure from the U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops, it appeared that senators might go along. Hundreds of Latinas and women of all backgrounds descended on Capitol Hill to let legislators know that they can not play politics with our reproductive health care and to advocate for abortion care coverage as a part of health care reform. For now, senators are standing up to those who would sink reform with abortion politics, voting to table the Nelson amendment, effectively killing it. But we know that these victories are often tenuous and that the growing Latina voice in favor of reproductive health care must stay strong. Over the past few weeks, I've heard from many Latinas and their families, outraged that these amendments would make a legal medical procedure financially inaccessible for many women. They called their senators and wrote letters on behalf of daughters, sisters, aunts and mothers in their communities, urging policymakers to vote for reform that includes coverage for abortion -- and also provides health care access for immigrants. They organized because they know what is at stake. The amendments claim to ""simply codify"" the Hyde amendment, an existing federal policy that prohibits federal government money from being used to fund abortions through Medicaid. But in reality, both amendments would create a two-tier health care system. After 30-plus years of the Hyde amendment, a Guttmacher Institute report released this year indicates that among Medicaid-eligible women -- that is, low income -- who would have an abortion if it were paid for by the government, one in four instead continue the pregnancy to term in the absence of funding.  This is because politicians prevent federal tax dollars from covering the procedure. Moreover, the proposed House and Senate bills both maintain the five-year ban on legal permanent residents accessing publicly funded benefits, including Medicaid, leaving millions of legal residents without coverage for basic medical needs. According to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 38 percent of Latinas are uninsured, compared with 14.7 percent non-Hispanic white women, and more than half of all immigrants are women. The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that by 2050, one in four Americans will be Latina. As Latinas, we will be disproportionately affected if we do not have a health care package that includes access to the full range of reproductive health services. Opponents argue that more women will be covered under overall health care reform, as if that should satisfy us. The fact remains: If millions of low- and moderate-income women covered under a new federally subsidized health system can't access abortion care from an insurance plan bought even partly with federal support, policymakers are essentially telling them that they do not matter -- that the reality of their lives must be ignored. The legacy of health care reform should not be to send women back into the shadows. We have worked too hard to reform our health care system for women to be worse off than they were before. There is no denying that people around the country, including many Latinas, have complex feelings about abortion. Many have conflicting feelings because of their religious faith -- Latinas are overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. But my work with Latinas during these debates reminds me that for many women confronted by the decision to terminate a pregnancy, abortion is not a political issue; it's a personal health care issue between a woman, her family and her doctor. We have an opportunity to make history in these next few weeks and months. Health care is not a luxury; it is fundamental to a healthier and stronger nation. I urge policymakers to respect women who are trying to plan their pregnancies, take control of their futures and improve the lives of their families. We demand reproductive justice for women. Anything less would be un-American.

"(CNN) -- One volunteer woke up every morning with a sigh, relieved that no one had murdered him in his home the night before. Another expected a bullet from a sniper whenever she strolled down the street. And one young woman was so petrified after an encounter that she urinated on herself in public. We've heard about the inspirational side of the civil rights movement: the rousing marches, freedom songs and electrifying speeches. But these recollections come from a group of civil rights veterans who sound more like combat soldiers who once lived in constant terror. That's part of the power of the new documentary, ""Freedom Summer,"" which premieres Tuesday at 9 p.m. on PBS. The ""American Experience"" film captures the idealism that inspired an interracial group of college students to journey to Mississippi for 10 weeks in the summer of 1964 to register African-American voters. But it also reveals what happened when that idealism collided with the casual brutality of white Mississippians who saw Freedom Summer as a ""nigger communist invasion."" A terrifying warning . ""There is no guarantee that you will get out of this summer alive; just know that,"" Bob Moses, a Freedom Summer organizer, told volunteers after learning that three of their colleagues had been killed. There have been plenty of films on the violence of segregationist Mississippi. Yet ""Freedom Summer,"" directed by MacArthur ""genius grant"" fellow Stanley Nelson, goes deeper. Nelson unearths rare film footage, interviews former segregationists, and persuades some Freedom Summer veterans to tell stories they had never before shared in public. Still, what may be most striking about the film is not what is said but what is implied. Nelson captures the idealism of an era in America that seems as distant as covered wagons. Ordinary Americans believed they could change the world. Most Freedom Summer volunteers were only 19 or 20. They had heard President Kennedy's challenge to ""ask what you can do for your country."" They saw themselves as patriots. ""It was terrifying,"" Dorothy Zellner, a former volunteer, says in the film. ""But if you cared about this country and you cared about democracy, you had to go."" The paranoia of white Mississippi . Democracy was on life support in the Mississippi of 1964. Almost half the state's residents were black, but only 6% were registered to vote. In some counties, blacks made up 70% or more of the population but were barred from voting through a combination of literacy tests, economic intimidation -- they could lose their jobs, homes or land for registering to vote -- and raw violence. It may seem odd today that the white power structure in Mississippi was willing to be so brutal just to keep people from voting. The film, though, shows that the whites' brutality was driven by an apocalyptic fear: Black voters would drive them from office, and from the state. Some had other fears that had nothing to do with politics. They seethed with fury after seeing white college women, who came to Mississippi for Freedom Summer, interact with black men and live with black families. One white volunteer recounted how segregationists were obsessed with interracial sex; one sheriff even asked her to describe the size of big black men's penises. ""We face the absolute extinction of all we hold dear,"" Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett thundered during a speech at the time. ""We must be strong enough to crush the enemy."" A brush with death . The goal of Freedom Summer, though, was to do more than register black voters. It was to empower blacks as well. The volunteers established Freedom Schools where they taught black Mississippians about black history. They established an interracial delegation to the 1964 Democratic National Convention that made a daring, nationally publicized bid to unseat Mississippi's all-white delegation. Some of the most powerful segments in the film, though, come during its smaller moments: A burly white sheriff viciously tries to snatch an American flag out of the hands of a small black boy leaving a courthouse; the boy bravely holds on while he's swung like a rag doll. A former beauty queen from Mississippi recounts how family members were driven from their homes simply for having dinner with Freedom Summer volunteers. A boy photographed being educated in a ramshackle Freedom School explains how that summer changed the arc of his life; he is now a poised college professor and author. One of the film's most riveting moments comes when volunteer Linda Wetmore Halpern tells a story that, until then, she had been too embarrassed to share. Halpern was walking alone on a Mississippi road one day in her summer dress when a group of laughing white men drove up, surrounded her, and told her they hadn't killed a white girl yet. The men grabbed her, tied a noose around her neck and tied the noose to the car. Then they started to drive, forcing her to keep up while calling her ""nigger lover."" As they sped up, Halpern says, she thought she was going to die. The men then stopped, untied the noose from the car and laughed as they drove away. Halpern stood alone in the road petrified. ""I peed all over myself,"" she says, her voice shaking years later. ""I just stood there and peed."" Who were the true heroes? Despite the courage of people like Halpern, most of the volunteers say today that the true Freedom Summer giants were the black Mississippians they worked with. Most of the students would eventually return to college, but the black residents remained to contend with the wrath of segregationists -- many for the rest of their lives. Dave Dennis, one of the Freedom Summer volunteers, remembers one such couple. He recalls seeing an elderly black man and wife pull up to a courthouse in a mule-driven buggy. The man climbed out, walked up to a set of courthouse steps ringed with white deputies, and asked where he could register to vote. ""I'm haunted by the question of what happened to them,"" Dennis says. ""I know they caught hell. Those to me were the heroes."" Dennis caught hell as well. He was with Medgar Evers, the head of Mississippi's NAACP, on the day Evers was murdered in front of his home. Dennis also knew one of the three civil rights workers who were killed that summer. At the funeral for one of the slain workers, Dennis broke down publicly while delivering remarks, shrilly shouting, ""I'm tired of going to funerals."" Dennis says some of his black colleagues from SNCC -- the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which organized Freedom Summer -- had worked virtually alone in Mississippi for three or four years before white volunteers joined them that summer. ""No one felt like he was going to make it out alive,"" he says. Not only did virtually all the Freedom Summer volunteers make it out of Mississippi alive, they were alive in a way they had never been before. The experience transformed them, made some of them more radical. Many of them had learned to some extent what it felt like to live as a minority. They had to stay with black families that summer and listen to their instructions to remain alive. ""They couldn't step out of the black community,"" says Nelson, director of ""Freedom Summer."" ""They couldn't go downtown. They got the hateful looks that black people get all the time. They had people driving by screaming stuff at them. They got a view of race that very few white people get."" The momentum generated by Freedom Summer led to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which removed all the barriers whites had erected to discourage black voters. Last year, a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court voted to gut a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. Since 2011, 14 states -- including Mississippi -- have passed voter ID laws, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy institute in New York. Critics say such laws discourage minorities, the poor and elderly from voting. Nelson, who has directed other PBS films such as ""Freedom Riders,"" says many of the Freedom Summer volunteers see history repeating itself with the recent Supreme Court decision. ""Everyone feels horrible about it,"" Nelson says. ""Everyone is so upset."" Some Freedom Summer veterans have organized voting seminars in an effort to maintain the victories they earned 50 years ago. But some of those victories can't be erased by any court decision. Chris Williams, a white Freedom Summer volunteer from Vermont, said though he went South to help black Mississippians, they ended up helping him more. He witnessed acts of courage from poor black Mississippians that stay with him today. And he saw a side of America that few white people see. ""I sincerely hope that I made some small difference in moving the movement forward"" he says. ""But I don't have any doubt all these years later that the person who benefited the most from my being in Mississippi was me.""","New documentary captures recollections of Freedom Summer civil rights veterans .

"(CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen was released from a Colorado jail Friday after he was arrested on domestic-violence-related charges, Aspen police said. Sheen, 44, was charged with second degree assault and menacing, both felonies, and criminal mischief, a misdemeanor, police said. Additionally, Colorado law mandates a protective order between someone arrested for domestic violence and the victim. Police said the alleged victim, whom they did not identify, did not require a trip to a hospital. Sheen was released from the Pitkin County Jail at 7 p.m. local time after posting $8,500 bond. He is scheduled to appear in court February 8. His spokesman, Stan Rosenfield, cautioned against jumping to conclusions. ""Do not be misled by appearance,"" Rosenfield said. ""Appearance and reality can be as different as night and day."" Sheen has been married to sometime actress and real estate investor Brooke Mueller Sheen, his third wife, since May 2008. The couple has twin sons born in March. Sheen stars in the popular television comedy ""Two and a Half Men"" with Jon Cryer. Sheen -- whose real name is Carlos Irwin Estevez -- is the son of actor Martin Sheen. He has two brothers and a sister -- Emilio, Ramon and Renee Estevez -- who are also actors.","Actor charged with several offenses with a domestic violence component, police say .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen voluntarily entered an undisclosed rehabilitation center for treatment Friday, his representative said. ""He is most grateful to all who have expressed their concern,"" Sheen representative Stan Rosenfield said. The announcement came a day after Sheen was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where Rosenfield said he was treated for severe pain related to a hernia. He checked out of the Los Angeles hospital Thursday night, he said. ""Charlie has had a hernia condition for some time,"" Rosenfield said. ""I was told by the person who made the 911 call that it was hernia-related."" Sheen's hit CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" has been placed on ""production hiatus,"" CBS and Warner Bros. Television said Friday. ""We are profoundly concerned for his health and well-being, and support his decision,"" their joint statement said. Porn actress Kacey Jordan, who was at Sheen's house the night before his trip to the hospital, issued a statement through her representative Friday. She is ""very happy that Charlie decided to get some help, it was clear to me if he didn't he would have died,"" Jordan's statement said. ""He is such a talented actor, and has his beautiful children to think about."" It was the second emergency trip to a hospital for Sheen in three months. He spent several hours in a New York hospital in October after police responded to an early morning call about ""an emotionally disturbed person"" at the Plaza Hotel, a law enforcement source said at the time. Sheen's representative blamed an ""adverse allergic reaction"" to a medication. Sheen, the son of actor Martin Sheen, spent at least a month last year at a Malibu, California, rehab center, but it was never disclosed what he was treated for there. He was arrested in December 2009 after his wife, Brooke Mueller, told Aspen, Colorado, police that he threatened her with a knife at their holiday home. A Colorado judge allowed the actor to count his time at Promises of Malibu toward a 30-day jail sentence after he entered a guilty plea in August in that case. The plea deal reduced the charges from felony domestic violence to a misdemeanor third-degree assault count.

"(CNN) -- I was born in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1954, the year of the landmark school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education. The struggle for integration has shaped my life from the very beginning. When my father, an art professor at Florida A&M University, sought to pursue his doctorate in art education at Florida State University, the state of Florida chose to pay his transportation to Penn State rather than open its doors to an African-American graduate student. In 1957, he completed his degree at Penn State, and in 1958 became the first African-American professor at Bridgewater State College, now Bridgewater State University, in Massachusetts, where I grew up. My parents were part of the great migration, moving to the North to escape segregation. They achieved their goal. My three siblings and I attended predominantly white public schools in our small Massachusetts town without protest or high court drama, and graduated well-prepared for the colleges we all attended. Forty-four years later, in 2002, my husband and I left Massachusetts and returned to the South -- initiating our family's reverse migration. Eventually our sons, and even my parents, moved to Atlanta, too. They returned to a region very different than the one they remembered. Fifty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, their choice of housing and their freedom of movement are unencumbered by race. But 60 years after racial segregation was outlawed in schools, public education is again segregating along racial lines. And not just in the South, but across the United States. Schools are more segregated today than in the 1980s, according to a new report released by researchers at UCLA's Civil Rights Project, ""Brown at 60: Great Progress, a Long Retreat and Uncertain Future."" This is the result of continued patterns of residential segregation, and a series of Supreme Court decisions that have quietly undermined the implementation of Brown through a shift away from court-ordered busing and other mandated desegregation strategies. As school districts move back to ""neighborhood school"" policies, white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had. Particularly for young white children, interaction with people of color is likely to be a virtual reality rather than an actual one, with media images (often negative ones) most clearly shaping their attitudes and perceived knowledge of communities of color. For students of color, the return to segregation means the increased likelihood of attending a school with limited resources. Most highly segregated black and Latino schools have high percentages of poor children. At most highly segregated white schools, middle-class students are in the majority. The negative educational impact of attending high-poverty schools is well-documented. Whether a student comes from a poor or middle-income family, academic achievement is likely to decline if the student attends a high-poverty school. Conversely, academic performance is likely to improve if the student attends a middle-class school, even if his or her own family is poor. The learning conditions which are taken for granted in middle-class suburban schools are too often absent in impoverished classrooms. It is not surprising that the outcomes associated with high-poverty schools across the country are bleak: lower test scores, higher dropout rates, fewer course offerings and low levels of college attendance. If we remember that the original impetus for the Brown lawsuit was not simply a symbolic fight for the acknowledgment of the equality of all children, but a struggle for equal access to publicly funded educational resources, we can see that the struggle continues. So, what must we do? In particular, white children will need to be in schools that are intentional about helping them understand social justice issues like prejudice, discrimination and racism, empowering them to think critically about the stereotypes to which they are exposed in the culture. Such tools are needed to help them acquire the social skills necessary to function effectively in a diverse world, and are essential for continued progress in a society still struggling to disentangle the racism woven into the fabric of its founding. The hopeful news is that there are educators around the country working hard to create anti-racist classrooms and learning environments even when their classrooms are predominantly white. Children of color in under-resourced, racially isolated schools also need these same tools. But they will also require powerful advocates to insure that they have committed and well-trained teachers, a challenging curriculum and the educational resources needed to inspire their own striving for excellence. Providing these resources equitably is a daunting task, one that has never been accomplished in the history of education in the United States. Yet we fail to do it at our own peril. In 2014, the question we all must ask is: How do we build strong school communities where every student, regardless of race, is supported to achieve his or her personal best, and teach the skills needed to live in healthy, democratic society? When we can answer that question, the promise of Brown v. Board of Education will be fulfilled.","The 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education is May 17, 2014 .

"(CNN) -- White House hopeful Mitt Romney on Thursday articulated his position on the role of religion in America, but avoided details about his personal faith. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said ""freedom opens the windows of the soul."" Romney, who hopes to become the first Mormon president, said ""religious tolerance would be a shallow principle, indeed, if it were reserved only for faiths with which we agree."" ""There are some who would have a presidential candidate describe and explain his church's distinctive doctrines. To do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited in the Constitution,"" the former Massachusetts governor said. ""No candidate should become the spokesman for his faith. For if he becomes president he will need the prayers of the people of all faiths."" CNN contributor Bill Bennett said he wasn't sure Romney addressed the concerns voters might have with Mormonism, but, he added, ""I don't think he had to."" ""I can see this speech he just gave being given by any of the Republican candidates and most of the Democratic candidates, frankly. I'm not sure he was responding to the concern 'what about this Mormon thing?' "" Bennett said. ""I think he will probably get more questions on it, not fewer."" Another CNN contributor, Roland Martin, said the setting for the speech was a good one -- ""in the heart of the Bible Belt.""  Watch Bennett and Martin debate the effectiveness of Romney's speech » . Romney spoke at former President George H. W. Bush's presidential library at Texas A&M University before a crowd of about 300 people: a combination of friends, family and religious and conservative leaders. ""What he is trying to say is 'I am a person of faith. Forget the fact what my faith is, that I am a Mormon. You might be Christian. You might be Jewish. I'm a person of faith. I believe in God,' "" Martin said. Romney said religion is essential to freedom, without pointing to any specific faith. ""Freedom requires religion, just as religion requires freedom. Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God. Freedom and religion endure together, or perish alone,"" the GOP contender said. Romney, who had brushed off comparisons to John F. Kennedy's famous address, didn't hesitate to mention the 1960 speech. ""Almost 50 years ago another candidate from Massachusetts explained that he was an American running for president, not a Catholic running for president,"" Romney said. ""Like him, I am an American running for president. I do not define my candidacy by my religion. A person should not be elected because of his faith nor should he be rejected because of his faith.""  Watch Romney explain what role religion would play in his presidency » . Kennedy took the stage in Houston, Texas, and addressed concerns that the Vatican would influence his policies.  Watch Kennedy describe the 'real issues' of his time » . Like Kennedy, Romney told the audience that his church would not influence his presidential decisions. Romney said he did not ""confuse"" religion and politics as governor and he would not do it as president. ""If I am fortunate to become your president, I will serve no one religion, no one group, no one cause, and no one interest. A president must serve only the common cause of the people of the United States,"" he said. Romney, however, said he would not distance himself from his religion.  Watch what's behind Romney's decision to talk about faith » . ""I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavor to live by it. My faith is the faith of my fathers -- I will be true to them and to my beliefs,"" he said, adding that if his faith hurts his candidacy, ""so be it."" Romney avoided explaining differences in his church's beliefs and other faiths. Instead, he pointed to similarities between churches in America, saying they share a ""common creed of moral convictions."" Romney said he thought some have taken the idea of separation of church and state beyond its original meaning by trying to remove any acknowledgment of God from the public arena. ""It is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America -- the religion of secularism. They are wrong,"" he said. Nearly 77 percent of those questioned in an October CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll said the fact that a candidate is a Mormon would not be a factor in the way they vote for president. But a significant portion -- 19 percent -- said they are less likely to vote for a Mormon. ""Those who have the biggest problem supporting a Mormon are churchgoing and evangelical Christians -- particularly those who believe that Mormonism is not a Christian religion,"" CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said, citing the October poll.  What do Mormons believe? » . And that also represents a large portion of the Republican base. Religion reporter Dick Ostling said Romney's speech marks an important moment for Mormons. ""Historically, the church has been very vigorously persecuted,"" Ostling told CNN. ""And today they are becoming more normalized in the normal run of American life."" Ostling said Romney is trying to make the case that although there are are a lot of differences between the Mormon church and Protestant and Catholic Christians, ""we can unite behind these cultural, American moral values."" Romney is trying to win over conservative Christians as rival Republican Mike Huckabee, a former Baptist minister, makes gains in the polls. The former Arkansas governor is touted in one of his television ads as the ""Christian leader."" ""Understand, Mike Huckabee is rising because he is speaking to those social conservatives, these evangelicals. So Mitt Romney needs to identify with them saying, 'You're a person of faith, I'm a person of faith, let's break bread together, and let's agree to agree or agree to disagree,' "" Martin said.

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton might be in the midst of one of the fiercest Formula One battles of recent years but the Mercedes man is staying cool -- ice cool. While Hamilton has just eight races remaining to secure a second world title, the 29-year-old took time out to brave the ALS ice bucket challenge. But while some might have frozen with shock, Hamilton was in red-hot form during practice at Spa Francorchamps, Belgium, Friday. The British driver, who trails teammate Nico Rosberg by 11 points in the standings, finished more than half-a-second clear of the field in the second practice session. ""It's great to be back in the car and it was feeling good out there today,"" Hamilton told reporters on the first day back after the mid-season break. ""The morning wasn't as strong, but it definitely improved in the afternoon. As always, we still have work to do tonight, but overall today was OK. ""It stayed dry throughout both sessions but the forecast is wet for tomorrow, so it was important to maximize track time as this may be our last dry running before the race. ""We've seen rain so often here in the past and that can really mix things up -- particularly when it's wet in places and dry in others. ""Your visor is almost level with the ground, so it's not like looking from above where you can see the different patches. ""That makes it really hard to pick out the areas where you can find grip, but it's also a lot of fun."" Hamilton set a fastest lap of one minute 49.189 seconds on the soft compound tires, with German Rosberg just behind on one minute 49.793 seconds. Fernando Alonso, who finished 0.741 seconds behind Hamilton, was third ahead of Williams' Felipe Massa and Jenson Button in the McLaren. Hamilton, whose five victories this season have taken him to 191 points, will start as favorite for pole position on Saturday but Rosberg is confident he can come out on top with adverse weather expected. ""As normal, it will be a long night analyzing everything that we learned today to really nail it tomorrow,"" Rosberg told reporters. ""The interesting challenge for this weekend is to find the right compromise between being quick over one lap and over a long distance in the race -- especially if it's wet tomorrow, with the predictions currently saying we will have mixed conditions.""

"(CNN) -- Charlie Sheen's plea deal to resolve felony domestic violence charges in Aspen, Colorado, will allow the actor to serve his jail term at a Malibu, California, rehab center, his lawyer said Monday. ""Guilty as charged, your honor,"" Sheen answered when the judge asked for his plea. But ""as charged"" did not include a felony count. It was dropped in exchange for Sheen's guilty plea to a misdemeanor third-degree assault count, Pitkin County, Colorado, court spokesman Rob McCallum said. The case stemmed from Sheen's arrest on Christmas Day after his wife, Brooke Mueller, told Aspen police he threatened her with a knife at their holiday home. ""We're very pleased with the plea,"" defense lawyer Yale Galanter said after Monday's sentencing. Sheen, in a statement issued through his publicist, said he was ""very grateful."" ""I look forward to complying with the court's decision, getting on with my life and putting this behind me,"" he said. The 30-day jail sentence could be completed quickly since the judge will count time the actor spent at the same rehab facility -- Promises of Malibu -- earlier this year, McCallum said. Sheen, 44, also will serve three months of unsupervised probation and attend 36 hours of domestic violence evaluation and treatment. The sentence means that Sheen can be on the set in Burbank, California, when production on the new season of his hit CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" resumes Tuesday morning, Galanter said. Mark Burg, who is Sheen's manager, said show production will not be affected. ""Thankfully, the Pitkin County court is letting him keep three (hundred) or four hundred people employed each week."" ""We employ a lot of people,"" Burg said. ""And Charlie, without him, there is no show."" A former Aspen police officer who interviewed Mueller and took photos after the incident said she was ""appalled"" that Sheen got the ""lightest possible sentence imaginable."" ""I wish that the judge could have seen what Mrs. Sheen looked like on that Christmas Day,"" said Valerie McFarlane, who lost her job with the Aspen Police Department earlier this year in an unrelated matter. Galanter, who also has represented Sheen's wife, said she is ""totally on board"" with the plea agreement. ""Brooke wanted the charges dismissed completely and still does,"" Galanter said. Sheen's legal trouble began last Christmas morning when his wife called police. ""My husband had me with a knife and I'm scared for my life and he threatened me,"" Mueller, 32, told a police dispatcher. A police report quoted Mueller saying Sheen held a switchblade knife to her throat as he held her down on her bed. ""You better be in fear,"" the report alleged Sheen told his wife. ""If you tell anybody, I'll kill you. Your mother's money means nothing. I have ex-police I can hire who know how to get the job done and they won't leave any trace."" An Aspen police officer wrote that he saw ""red marks on the upper part of the front of her neck."" Sheen denied attacking his wife, but admitted breaking her glasses, the police report said. The argument began when Mueller became jealous that Sheen ""shared a song for his daughter, whom he fathered with another woman,"" the officer quoted Sheen as saying. Sheen told police he became angry when his wife threatened to divorce him and fight for custody of their twin sons, the report said. Aspen police charged Sheen with felony second-degree assault, felony menacing and a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief. He was booked under his birth name, Carlos Irwin Estevez. Both Sheen and Mueller, 32, entered substance abuse rehabilitation several weeks after the incident. The couple was married in 2008. Their twin sons, Max and Bob, celebrated their first birthday in March.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel approved the construction of several hundred housing units in the West Bank, the prime minister's office said early Sunday, a day after five Israelis were killed in their home in the disputed territory. The government approved the construction in the settlements of Gush Etzion, Maale Adumim, Ariel and Kiryat Sefer in a rare Saturday-night decision. The development came shortly after five members of an Israeli family were killed in the West Bank, in what Israel is calling a terror attack. ""The terrorists murdered a young family, a mother, a father, a boy of 11, a boy of 4, a baby girl of four months. They all had their throats slit,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday. Throngs of mourners gathered in Jerusalem Sunday for the funeral of Ehud Fogel 36, his wife Ruth, 35, and their children Yoav, Elad and Hadas. The event was broadcast on Israeli television. Their bodies were discovered by the Fogels' 12-year-old daughter when she came home Friday night, a family neighbor told Israeli media. Two other children were left alive when the killers apparently did not notice the door to the room they were sleeping in. ""In a moment they were torn away from us by the force of monsters, vicious animals that were capable of slashing the throats of a boy or a baby a few months old,"" said Rabbi Meir Lau, former chief rabbi of Israel, at the burial service for the slain family members. Mourners encircling the shrouded bodies of the victims wept and prayed. Ruth Fogel's father, Rabbi Yehuda Ben Yishai said ""our children are prepared to be sacrificed as an offering at the altar we have to continue to build to bring redemption. Hudi and Ruthie wanted this redemption."" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said that ""all objective data based on the investigation"" led the government to believe ""the only possible conclusion"" was that the settlement murders were a terror attack. He would not elaborate on what evidence was leading investigators to that conclusion. Netanyahu convened a special meeting of the ministerial committee for settlements Saturday night after the killings. Interior Minister Eli Yishai argued that not enough new housing had been approved, saying the number should have been 5,000 units -- 1,000 for each person murdered. Nabil Abu Reudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, called the Israeli decision ""wrong and unacceptable"" in a statement reported by the official Palestinian Authority news agency Wafa. He warned that it could lead to a further escalation of conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. The Palestinian Authority and many international observers object to the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which the Palestinians want to be the basis of a future state. Israel has temporarily halted settlement expansion in the past, but says a permanent freeze is a matter for negotiations with the Palestinians. According to a military spokeswoman, an intruder entered the Israeli settlement of Itamar near the northern West Bank city of Nablus around 1 a.m., made his way into the family home and killed the two parents and their three children. Abbas spoke to Netanyahu to express his sorrow over the event, the Israeli prime minister said Sunday -- adding it did not go far enough. ""I told him that we expect much more unequivocal condemnations but even more than that, we want to see unequivocal action by the PA to stop allowing this incitement, that it stop leading this incitement,"" Netanyahu said, according to his office. On Sunday, military units continued their search of the surrounding area for the assailant. Military spokesman Maj. Peter Lerner said more than one person may have carried out the crime. Netanyahu demanded that the Palestinian Authority assist in finding those responsible and ""halt the incitement in the mosques and via the Palestinian Authority-controlled media."" He did not explicitly blame Palestinians for the deaths. ""This is a heinous act of a murder of a whole innocent family -- parents, children and baby -- while they were sleeping in their home on the Sabbath night,"" Netanyahu said. ""Israel will not accept such a heinous murder and will act strongly to keep the safety of the lives of Israeli citizens and punish the murderers."" He added, ""We all know, as do those who want to strike at us will know, that the future of the settlements will not be decided upon by terror."" Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad denounced the killings. ""I say that in regards to what happened (Saturday) in Itamar settlement -- and the victims were a toddler and two children, the father and mother -- exactly as we have always said against violence ... we refuse this and condemn it,"" Fayyad said, according to his spokesman, Ghassan Khatib. ""We refuse and condemn violence, whatever the reasons are or the perpetrators or targets or victims."" The White House condemned the slayings ""in the strongest possible terms"" and said the killers of the ""heinous"" act must be held accountable. ""There is no possible justification for the killing of parents and children in their home,"" it said in a statement. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added that she was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the incident. ""The murderers must be found and brought to justice,"" she said, asking the Palestinian authorities ""to assist in every way possible."" The United Nations, the European Union, the Russian Federation and United States also issued a joint statement condemning the murders. The four entities are members of the Quartet on the Middle East, an association involved in mediating the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. ""The Quartet condemns in the strongest possible terms the violent murder of an Israeli family of five, including three young children, in the West Bank today,"" the statement read. ""The Quartet offers their condolences to the loved ones of the victims and to the Israeli people."" ""Attacks on any civilians are completely unacceptable in any circumstance,"" the statement continued. ""The Quartet calls on those responsible to be brought to justice and welcomes the strong condemnation of this attack by President Abbas and the Palestinian leadership.""

"(CNN) -- Widely considered Japan's cultural capital, Kyoto is one of the country's top travel destinations among domestic and, increasingly, international tourists. Drawing 50 million visitors a year, it's the place to learn to whip up a cup of matcha green tea, admire the craftsmanship of a geisha's kimono and study the art of the zen garden in an ancient temple before sitting down for a $500 kaiseki (Japanese haute cuisine) dinner. Readers of ""Travel+Leisure"" magazine even voted it world's best city this year, citing its ""emerging style scene that's cutting edge."" Yet despite Kyoto's obvious allure, until earlier this year there was one glaring absence from the city's travel scene -- a top tier, super-luxury hotel brand. Ritz-Carlton ended that drought in February with the opening of its fourth Japan property, located close to popular downtown areas like Gion and Kawaramachi-dori, the city's retail and entertainment district. ""It is actually quite odd that there have not been international ultra-luxe hotel brands in Kyoto until recently, considering the fact that Kyoto is an extremely popular tourist destination,"" says Catherine Heald, CEO of luxury travel planner Remote Lands. ""Kyoto's Hyatt Regency is very nice and it has sufficed, but it is not a Park Hyatt which is more in line with Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons. The most sumptuous accommodations to date have actually been Hoshinoya [by Japanese brand Hoshino Resorts], which is what I call a Japanese hybrid ryokan (a cross between a ryokan and a hotel), very little known outside Japan. "" The decision to open in Kyoto was a matter of catering to demand, says Ritz-Carlton, Kyoto general manager Yuji Tanaka. ""The Ritz-Carlton is constantly listening to its loyal guests and a constant theme for us is to build hotels where our guests want us to be and Kyoto was high on the list,"" he says. ""Bringing the brand to Kyoto is a major milestone -- a global iconic city, a window to Japan while being sensitive to centuries of tradition. We were fortunate to be able to work with like-minded partners in a rare location."" Billing itself a modern international luxury ryokan, the property has 134 rooms and suites and faces the Kamogawa River and the Higashiyama Mountains in the distance. What's inside . It's difficult not to dismiss the ""luxury ryokan"" term as marketing fluff. A ryoken is, after all, a basic Japanese inn and the Ritz-Carlton brand hardly conjures images of elderly kimono-clad women bringing you a pot of green tea once you awake from a night on a futon. But during a recent visit we found there's some merit to the claim, given the intense attention to detail and subtle touches, like tatami suites, where guests can enjoy a classic futon experience -- albeit while covered in 600-thread-count linens. The architects and designers infused the character of a traditional Meiji house and courtyard into the architectural structure of the building, while blending in modern design elements. This includes the use of patterned motifs created by local artists and the incorporation of zen gardens (karesansui) and water features, such as a stunning three-story waterfall positioned in the heart of the hotel that stretches down to the basement swimming pool. ""Each Ritz-Carlton is designed with a strong sense of place,"" says Tanaka. ""This property carries the heart and soul of Ritz-Carlton service while staying true to the community in which it is located. The Ritz-Carlton, Kyoto was designed very much as a peaceful sanctuary and with the principles of miyabi -- or Japanese aesthetic concepts -- in mind."" The hotel's Mizuki Japanese restaurant is already gaining a reputation among locals for its incredible kaiseki expertise -- the world's most beautiful multi-course feast -- and also serves sushi, teppanyaki and tempura. Even the Italian restaurant pays respect to Japan's history. Inside the beautifully decorated venue they've reassembled a townhouse once owned by Kyoto magnate Denzaburi Fujitia and turned it into a private dining room. More luxury on the way . Though big brands are notably absent, luxury seekers in Kyoto have hardly been neglected through the years. There are a handful of top-end ryokans, but they fill quickly during popular travel times -- particularly cherry blossom season in spring and the changing of the leaves in fall. Tawaraya, for instance, has been described as the top ryokan in not just Kyoto, but all of Japan. ""Most of our clients do two-week trips to Japan including three nights each in Tokyo and Kyoto, plus three or four other destinations,"" says Remove Land's Catherine Heald. ""They typically want a mix of hotels and ryokans -- and I strongly urge all clients to do at least one ryokan. ""Traditional ryokans include elaborate 12-plus-course kaiseki dinners every night, which are absolutely heavenly in my opinion, but they can be over the top for many Western travelers to have every single night, so it is nice to have variety and a mix of cuisines."" The arrival of a branded super-luxury hotel is welcome news for high-end travelers who want the full amenities and service that come with a global brand -- or can't live without their bacon and egg breakfast -- yet also want to experience the finer details of Japanese culture. The Ritz-Carlton Kyoto isn't alone in recognizing this. Competition is on the way, with the Four Seasons due to arrive in 2016. ""I think travel to Kyoto will inevitably increase with two new five-star world-class brands,"" says Heald. ""In the past it has been very difficult to get rooms in springtime during cherry blossom season, so that situation should change a lot with hundreds of new rooms available.""

"(CNN) -- One of the most memorable moments in the Democratic presidential primaries came last year when a debate moderator asked Joe Biden about his reputation for talking too much. Sen. Joe Biden credits his mother with teaching him to stand up for the little guy. The moderator asked Biden, who was described by the Los Angeles Times as a ""gaffe machine,"" if he could reassure voters that he would have enough verbal discipline needed for the world stage. ""Yes,"" Biden replied with a grin and a twinkle in his eyes. The moderator, NBC anchorman Brian Williams, waited for Biden to elaborate, but a still-grinning Biden said nothing more. Nervous titters spread through the crowd until the audience erupted in laughter. The Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama may be known for his eloquence. But Biden, his vice presidential running mate, can handle himself behind the podium as well. He is known for his ability to throw a verbal punch. Biden, often called the ""scrappy kid from Scranton,"" Pennsylvania, once described as ""bulls**t"" and ""malarkey"" President Bush's alleged implication that Obama wanted to appease terrorists by talking to nations that Washington considers terrorist states. He delivered this savage putdown of former Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani: ""There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb and 9/11.""  See Biden campaign photos » . Yet Biden's frankness can end up hurting him more than his intended target. During the Democratic presidential primaries, he was widely criticized for describing Obama as ""the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean."" More recently, Biden attracted attention for telling a crowd that Sen. Hillary Clinton ""might have been a better pick"" as Obama's running mate. Biden has weathered plenty of public bruises during his 36 years as a politician. But his private battles have been even more dramatic.  See timeline of Biden's life » . Jeffrey Rosen, writing for The New Republic magazine, said Biden's willingness to mix it up comes from his working-class upbringing in Scranton during the 1950s. Biden's father managed a car dealership and lectured his son at the dinner table about the horrors of the Holocaust. His dad once quit his job when he saw his boss throw silver dollars on the floor and watched his employees scramble for them, Rosen said. Biden's mother taught her son to stand up for the little guy as well, Rosen said, before highlighting a passage from Biden's autobiography, ""Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics."" ""The one thing my mother could not stand was meanness,"" Biden writes. ""She once shipped my brother off with instructions to bloody the nose of a kid who was picking on smaller kids. Religious figures and authority figures got no exemption. They abuse their power, you bloody their nose."" Biden took that pugnacious attitude into the political arena. After earning a law degree from Syracuse University, he won a Senate seat at age 29 representing Delaware in 1972 -- in a surprise victory. He eventually became the chairman of the powerful Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees, establishing himself as an authority on national security issues and the Supreme Court. In the 1980s, Biden led the Judiciary Committee through the explosive hearing for controversial conservative Judge Robert Bork. In 2005, one of Biden's distinctive moments on that committee came when he questioned Supreme Court chief justice nominee John Roberts during the confirmation hearings. Roberts, who would eventually sail through the hearings, had told committee members that he was not an ideologue but more like a judicial umpire who called balls and strikes. ""As much as I respect your metaphor, it's not very apt, because you get to determine the strike zone,"" Biden told Roberts. Biden first ran for president in 1988 but dropped out after charges of plagiarism in a stump speech. He also ran for the Oval Office this year but dropped out after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. He's serving his sixth congressional term, making him Delaware's longest-serving senator. Biden's private battles, though, have shaped him more profoundly than his political skirmishes. He overcame a stuttering problem as a child. In 1988, he had surgery for a brain aneurysm. A Roman Catholic, Biden carries a rosary and kept one under his pillow during brain surgery, according to People magazine.  Watch Biden's sister describe how he fought his stuttering » . His most wrenching private struggle took place at the beginning of his political career in 1972. His first wife and infant daughter were killed in a car wreck. In an interview with CNN's Abbie Boudreau, Biden said he even considered quitting politics after the loss of his wife and daughter. Boudreau asked Biden to read a passage from his autobiography to explain how he moved on to marry his current spouse, Jill.  Watch Biden's emotional reading from his book » . The passage recounts a moment when he asked his current wife, Jill, how she could marry him when she knew he had adored his first wife. ""She didn't hesitate,"" Biden said, reading from his book. ""That's the reason I can marry you. Anybody that can love that deeply once can do it again."" Biden swallowed hard, cleared his throat and looked down after he read that passage. Then he looked up again, his eyes welling with tears. He told Boudreau that his wife ""gave me permission to be me again."" ""I know that sounds corny,"" Biden said. ""But she really did. ... She brought me back."" Biden looked down again and said nothing more. For once, he was at a loss for words.","Los Angeles Times called Sen. Joe Biden a ""gaffe machine""

"(CNN) -- Warner Bros. Television has fired actor Charlie Sheen from its comedy ""Two and a Half Men"" after a two-week public meltdown by the star that has included attacks on the show's creator. ""After careful consideration, Warner Bros. Television has terminated Charlie Sheen's services on 'Two and a Half Men,' effective immediately,"" the company said in a statement issued Monday. ""This is very good news,"" Sheen said in a statement to TMZ. ""They continue to be in breach, like so many whales. ""It is a big day of gladness at the Sober Valley Lodge because now I can take all of their bazillions ... and I never have to put on those silly shirts for as long as this warlock exists in the terrestrial dimension."" Sheen, 45, has been known for his highly publicized marital, legal and substance abuse problems as much as his acting. The show was put on hiatus after he entered a rehabilitation program in January, and production was halted after Sheen blasted show co-creator Chuck Lorre and Alcoholics Anonymous in a February 24 radio interview. He has followed that up with a series of interviews in which he threatened to sue television network CBS for shutting down the nearly 8-year-old show, demanded a raise from $2 million to $3 million per episode and insisted he was ""clean, focused and ready to get back to work."" ""I feel more alive, I feel more focused, I feel more energetic,"" Sheen told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" last week. ""I'm on a quest to claim absolute victory on every front."" Sheen then joined the microblogging site Twitter, racking up more than 1.3 million followers in little more than a day -- a pace that has made the Guinness Book of World Records. His account currently lists more than 2 million followers. Amid his professional squabbles with Warner Bros. and CBS, Sheen's estranged wife, Brooke Mueller, won a court order removing their twin sons from Sheen's home after she told authorities he had threatened to cut her head off, ""put it in a box and send it to your mom."" In an interview with NBC's ""Today Show,"" Sheen denied making the threat and insisted the quote was fabricated. Sheen earlier pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge involving Mueller in August 2010, receiving a sentence of 30 days probation, as well as rehabilitation and anger-management counseling. The following October, adult-film actress Capri Anderson accused Sheen of terrorizing her during a drunken rampage in a room at the Plaza Hotel in New York; Sheen sued her in November, claiming she tried to extort money from him. And Sheen's second wife, Denise Richards, accused Sheen of physically and verbally abusing her and threatening her life. She obtained a restraining order against him in 2006. The couple divorced that year, and Richards has custody of their two daughters. Warner Bros. Television is a division of Time Warner Inc., also the parent company of CNN.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine claims its artillery destroyed much of a military convoy that crossed from Russia into Ukraine this week -- an incursion that two British newspapers say they witnessed. If true, Ukraine's account and the British reports appear to give credence to what Kiev has long alleged -- that Russia has been sending troops and arms into eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels have battled the Ukrainian military for months. A diplomatic row was brewing Friday over the reports, with the United Kingdom's foreign office summoning Russia's ambassador in London to explain the incident. Russia's foreign ministry has denied any such incursion, and its foreign minister will meet in Berlin with his counterparts from Ukraine, Germany and France on Sunday, state-run news agency RIA-Novosti reported. The meeting's agenda wasn't immediately released. Meanwhile, a separate Russian convoy -- more than 200 trucks that Moscow says contain relief goods for civilians in war-torn eastern Ukraine -- remained parked on the Russian side of the border, waiting for Ukrainian and other inspectors to decide whether to approve the aid's entry. That Ukraine so far has blocked the aid reflects Kiev's concerns -- held even before Thursday's reported military incursion -- that Russia might try to smuggle more military supplies. Ukraine: Majority of vehicles destroyed . Those concerns took on a new light when British media outlets The Guardian and The Telegraph reported that armored personnel carriers, along with other vehicles with Russian military plates, crossed the border near Donetsk, Ukraine, on Thursday night. The Guardian reported that it witnessed 23 armored personnel carriers, in addition to other vehicles with Russian military plates, cross into Ukraine through a gap in a barbed wire fence. ""Armed men were visible in the gloom by the border fence as the column moved into Ukraine,"" the Guardian report reads. This is the first time foreign media recorded such an incursion, though it illustrates what Kiev has said has been happening for months -- that Russia has been sending troops and equipment to help the rebels -- Ukrainian military Col. Andriy Lysenko told reporters. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told British Prime Minister David Cameron that Ukrainian forces destroyed ""the majority"" of the Russian vehicles, Poroshenko's office said. Poroshenko ""expressed concern over the situation on the border, particularly over the fact that the inflow of Russian arms and military machines in Ukraine through the open part of the border continued,"" his office said. Lysenko said he didn't know exactly how many vehicles crossed the border, or how many Ukraine's artillery managed to destroy. Purported humanitarian convoy still in Russia . Back in southern Russia, across the border from Ukraine's Luhansk region, 59 Ukrainian border guards and customs officers were inspecting the scores of trucks that Moscow says contain aid for civilians affected by fighting, the Ukrainian military said. Despite Ukraine's suspicions, Lysenko said that the aid is needed and that Ukraine would allow the Red Cross to distribute it if Ukraine and the aid group find the material suitable. Months of fighting has killed hundreds of people and, aid groups say, left thousands in eastern Ukraine without access to water, electricity and proper medical aid. The Red Cross is trying to establish what exactly is in the trucks, Andre Loersch, a Red Cross spokesman in Kiev, said. The Red Cross ""will temporarily deploy additional personnel to Ukraine and Russia for the purpose of this operation and is already in the process of identifying its staff ready for deployment,"" Loersch said. ""A four-member team is already present today in the vicinity of the convoy, and more staff are on their way."" Moscow says the trucks contain grain, sugar, baby food, medical supplies and sleeping bags. Ukraine, meanwhile, says it is distributing its own aid through the Red Cross. The Kiev-recognized governor of Luhansk, Irina Verigina, said this week that she doesn't want aid from Russia. ""They send us tanks and Grads (rocket-launching vehicles) overnight and offer to send humanitarian aid by day,"" she said. Battle rages on . Tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops have recently stepped up efforts to retake areas in and around Luhansk, Donetsk and Horlivka, three cities held by rebels for months. Donetsk has been the scene of intense shelling for days as rebels try to hold off Ukrainian forces. Eleven civilians were killed in a 24-hour period straddling Thursday and Friday, the Donetsk mayor's office said. Many districts were without power and water, the mayor's office said. A CNN crew that was in Donetsk earlier noted that the shelling had pushed some residents underground into cellars and half-built basements. Five Ukrainian troops were killed in the past day, Lysekno said Friday, adding that some rebels were retreating, trying to dig in closer to the Ukraine-Russia border. The ongoing fighting -- sparked last year with a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to estimates from U.N. officials. The United States and the European Union have applied steadily increasing sanctions against Russian officials, banks and other interests since March, when Russia annexed the Black Sea Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Russia's move came a month after Ukraine's parliament ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych left office after violent protests against his government in the capital, Kiev. Those protests were motivated in part by his decision to back out of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. Aid or invasion?

"(CNN) -- Civil rights activist Evelyn Gibson Lowery, who with her husband, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, participated in the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march in Alabama, died Thursday morning at her Atlanta home, a family spokeswoman said. She was 88. She suffered a stroke last week, and on Wednesday returned home from a hospital after medical personnel decided ""there was nothing more medically that they could do,"" the Lowery family said in a statement released Thursday. ""My beloved Evelyn was a special woman, whose life was committed to service, especially around the issues of empowering women,"" Joseph Lowery said. ""She was a wonderful mother and wife and I thank God that she didn't suffer any pain and that I was blessed having her as my partner, my confidante and my best friend for close to 70 years. ""I will miss her each and every day, but as a man of faith, I know that she is with her God.

Pioneers of the civil rights movement . The Lowerys' participation in the Selma-to-Montgomery march supporting African-Americans' right to vote was just one aspect of the couple's historic lives. They were among the pioneers of the American civil rights movement from its beginnings in the 1950s. Joseph Lowery -- sometimes referred to as the ""dean of the civil rights movement"" -- was a founder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil rights group formed in 1957. Martin Luther King Jr. was the first president of the group. Evelyn Lowery was the founder of SCLC's sister organization -- SCLC/Women's Organizational Movement for Equality Now Inc., found in 1979. The purpose of the group, according to a bio on her group's website, is to ""champion the rights of women, children, families, and responding to the problems of the disenfranchised regardless of ethnicity, gender, age, or religion."" In the 1980s, she founded several prominent programs, according to the profile. One is the Drum Major for Justice Awards Dinner, which honors people who made contributions in the arena of social justice. Another is The Evelyn G. Lowery Civil Rights Heritage Tour that honors icons of the civil rights movement. She is responsible for the establishment of monuments honoring those icons. She founded the Women's Empowerment Training Center for GED/computer training in 1988 and a mentoring program for girls in1995. Lowery was the daughter of a clergyman in Memphis, Tennessee, who served in the local NAACP.

"(CNN) -- The proposal by the Cordoba Initiative to build an Islamic center near Ground Zero has drawn major media attention and engendered fierce debate.  Right-wing political commentators, politicians, hard-line Christian ministers, bloggers and some families of 9/11 victims have charged that it is insensitive to 9/11 families, dishonors memories of the victims and will be a ""monument to terrorism."" But here are the facts:The center is not at Ground Zero but two blocks away, and the Cordoba Initiative seeks to build a center, not a mosque. The center is not designed as a local mosque for a Muslim community but rather to serve the wider community. It is meant to improve interfaith and Muslim-West relations and promote tolerance -- not just to provide services to Muslims. The proposed 15-story community center will include a prayer room, offices, meeting rooms, gym, swimming pool and performing arts center. The controversy over Cordoba House is not an isolated event. It is part of a much more far-reaching pattern and problem. Mosque construction in the United States has become a catalyst for increased anti-Islam and anti-Muslim sentiment, discrimination and hate crimes in recent years. Efforts to construct mosques to accommodate growing Muslim populations have sparked intense opposition. A commentary appearing in the New York Post last month attacked plans to construct mosques in the state of New York: . ""...There's no denying the elephant in the room. Neither is there any rejoicing over the mosques proposed for Sheepshead Bay, Staten Island and Ground Zero because where there are mosques, there are Muslims, and where there are Muslims, there are problems."" It continued: ""Before New York becomes New Yorkistan, it is worth noting that the capital of Great Britain was London until it became known as 'Londonstan,' degenerated by a Muslim community predominantly from South Asia and Africa, whose first generation of 'British Asians' has made the United Kingdom into a launching pad for terrorists."" In the face of such rhetoric, where do we go from here? Globalization and an increasingly multicultural and multireligious America (and Europe), with their significant Muslim populations, tests the mettle of Western democratic principles of free speech and freedom of worship. Unfortunately, American attitudes toward Islam and Muslims often blur the line between the peaceful and rational mainstream majority of Muslims on the one hand and the acts of a small but dangerous minority on the other. In some states, opposition to mosque construction has been led by politicians -- individuals charged with representing and upholding democratic values. In June 2010, a Tennessee Republican candidate, Lou Ann Zelenik, opposed the Muslim community's proposal to build a mosque in Murfreesboro, charging  the Muslim center was not part of a religious movement, but a political one ""designed to fracture the moral and political foundation of Middle Tennessee."" She warned, ""Until the American Muslim community find it in their hearts to separate themselves from their evil, radical counterparts, to condemn those who want to destroy our civilization and will fight against them, we are not obligated to open our society to any of them. "" The charge that Muslims do not condemn terrorism has been made repeatedly, despite that post-9/11, many Muslim leaders and organizations in America and globally have consistently denounced acts of terrorism. But major media outlets do not seem to find them newsworthy, and thus they must be found in smaller outlets on the internet. Even though major polls by the Gallup Organization and PEW research center show that the vast majority of American Muslims are well-integrated and, in contrast to many Muslim countries, pluralistic in outlook, a 2006 USAToday-Gallup poll found that substantial minorities of Americans admit to having negative feelings or prejudices against Muslims. Fewer than half the respondents believed U.S. Muslims are loyal to the United States. About four in 10 favored more rigorous security measures for Muslims than those used for other U.S. citizens and requiring Muslims who are U.S. citizens to carry a special ID and undergo special, more intensive, security checks before boarding airplanes in the United States. Islam-bashing charges leveled with no concrete evidence by pundits and politicians ring hollow. The call by some New York politicians for a delay in the construction of the Cordoba Center to examine its funding is simply grandstanding that reinforces the notion that somehow all Muslims, mosques and Islamic centers are guilty until proved innocent. Muslim center flap recalls earlier N.Y. controversy over Arabic-language school . Why should Muslims who are building a center be any more suspect than Jews who build a synagogue or center or Christians who build a church or conference center? As New York's Mayor Michael Bloomberg put it: ""If somebody wants to build a religious house of worship, they should do it and we shouldn't be in the business of picking which religions can and which religions can't. I think it's fair to say if somebody was going to try to on that piece of property build a church or a synagogue, nobody would be yelling and screaming. And the fact of the matter is that Muslims have a right to do it, too."" Muslims are part of the mosaic of America, citizens and believers who are economically, educationally and politically integrated. No longer predominantly new arrivals, many are second- and third-generation citizens. Despite terrorist attacks by a very small but dangerous minority of extremists, the majority of Muslims, like their non-Muslim fellow citizens, are loyal citizens. Islamophobia must be recognized for what it is, a social cancer as unacceptable as anti-Semitism, a threat to the very fabric of our democratic, pluralistic way of life. The line that distinguishes Islam from those who commit violence and terror in the name of Islam --between the majority of mainstream Muslims and the acts of a minority of Muslim terrorists -- must be maintained. Blurring these distinctions risks the adoption of foreign and domestic policies that promote a clash rather than co-existence of cultures and threaten the rights and civil liberties of Muslims.

"(CNN) -- He's broken nearly every bone in his body in one of the most exacting all sports -- on the way setting records for jump racing that many predict will never be surpassed -- but Thursday saw Northern Ireland's Tony McCoy reach a very special milestone. The 18-time champion jockey made it 4,000 career winners when he rode Mountain Tunes to victory at a meeting at Towcester racecourse in central England. The extent of McCoy's longevity and domination of racing over the fences in Britain and Ireland can be gauged by the fact that his nearest challenger, Richard Johnson, is some 1500 wins adrift of him. Victory on the 6-4 favorite came in typical style, two lengths behind at the final fence before driving his mount home in the novice hurdle to beat Jamie Moore on Kris Spin by half a length. It was also fitting that it came on a horse owned by the legendary JP McManus and trained by former Jonjo O'Neill, a combination which has supplied many winners for McCoy. ""It's amazing, it couldn't have worked out any better for Jonjo, JP, the McManuses have been so good to me, it was always going to be hopefully that I was going to ride it (the 4,000th winner) in JP's colours,"" McCoy told gathered reporters. Racing followers have been kept on the edge of their seats in recent weeks as McCoy produced a steady stream of winners to close on the 4,000 mark and he went into the Towcester meeting one short. Johnson paid tribute to his rival for his incredible achievements. ""He has completely rewritten what we thought was achievable in a season and a career,"" he told AFP. ""He seems to get it right all the time and is a great ambassador for our sport, a true professional sportsman."" Stan Mellor became the first jump jockey to ride 1,000 winners in 1971 and his record was subsequently broken by fellow greats John Francome (1,138 wins), Peter Scudamore (1,678) and Richard Dunwoody (1,699) before McCoy got to work in 1992 with his first winner at the age of just 17. Many flat racing jockeys in other countries have notched up more winners than McCoy, but their careers are generally longer and do not put themselves at risk of heavy falls that are a feature of jumping over fences under National Hunt rules. McCoy, who won a prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 2010, is showing no signs of slowing up and bookmakers are offering odds of as low as 6-1 that he will reach 5,000 winners before he retires.","Tony McCoy rides his 4,000th winner in steeplechase racing .

"(CNN) -- Two more churches in Malaysia were firebombed Sunday, bringing the total to six since a court ruled that non-Muslims can use the word ""Allah"" as a term for God. No one has been hurt in the attacks, which began Friday. They follow a high court's ruling that Christians can use the word ""Allah"" in literature printed in the country's official language, Malay. In Malay, the word for God is ""Allah,"" as it is in Arabic. But many in the predominantly Muslim country, including the government, believe the word should be exclusive to Islam. The government has banned the use of the word in Christian literature, saying it is likely to confuse Muslims and draw them to Christianity. It has also appealed the high court's ruling. The bombings may be an attempt to intimidate judges to overturn the decision, said the Rev. Hermen Shastri, general secretary of the Council of Churches in Malaysia. Political leaders from a range of parties deplored the attacks on the churches. Prime Minister Najib Razak visited one of the targeted churches on Saturday and called for calm. Emphasizing his resolve to maintain ethnic and racial harmony in society, Najib also said the Muslim faith prohibits insulting other religions or destroying their sanctuaries. In recent months, authorities in Malaysia have seized more than 20,000 Bibles because they refer to God as Allah. The seizures have fed fears among minority groups, which see signs of encroaching Islamic fundamentalism in the predominantly Muslim but multiracial country. A Roman Catholic weekly newspaper, The Herald, challenged the ban in court after the government threatened to revoke the newspaper's license for using the word in its Malay edition. Hearings on the case went on for two years before the high court's ruling last week. Malaysia has some of the tightest government restrictions on religion in the world, according to a study published last month by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. The country was among the 10 most restrictive countries out of 175 in the survey. But it had relatively low levels of social tension between religious groups, the report found. The Pew study covered events from mid-2006 to mid-2008. CNN's Kathryn Tancos contributed to this report.","Sunday bombings bring total to six since Friday .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Dodgers baseball manager Joe Torre's new book about his old club has been burning up best-seller lists even before it hits stores. Joe Torre speaks candidly with CNN's Larry King about his controversial new book, ""The Yankee Years."" In ""The Yankee Years,"" Torre candidly details his life as the former skipper of the team he led to four World Series titles. In the book, Torre slams some of his old players such as Alex Rodriguez and longtime Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. In his first TV interview, Torre talked with CNN's Larry King about the controversial tell-all book. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: Did you ever think you would become, at this stage of your life and career, controversial? Joe Torre: No. And I'm a little surprised, you know, not really, you know because it came out of New York and it involved the Yankees, obviously. You're always in the storm's eye, so to speak, when you're with the Yankees. To me, the book is much more than controversial. I think it's very informative. I'm very proud of, you know, coupling with Tom Verducci and how he wrote this book. King: Did you realize that some people might get upset at this? Torre: You know I think there's always going to be something that someone is going to resent. That's what I'd like to think that my reputation is -- being honest. I don't really think, it certainly wasn't my intention to shock anybody with stuff in this book. I just wanted to, you know, maybe put a heartbeat on some of these players that people think are robotic and basically tell the story -- and tell people my feelings -- of course, you know, the good years. We won the World Series. We were in the World Series -- to explain my feelings and my thoughts and my decisions. And, of course, you have to talk about the years you didn't win, too.  Watch Torre discuss controversial book with CNN's Larry King » . King:  How about those who say you violated the code? That, like Vegas, what happens in the clubhouse stays in the clubhouse? Boomer Wells, a pitcher who certainly has his own problems and wrote a book himself, calls you a punk for breaking that code. Torre: Well, Boomer and I have always had this type of relationship. We've had problems. But, really, I think we've always respected each other professionally. King:  All right, here's some of what you say in the book about Alex (Rodriguez) ""When Alex came over, it became strained in the clubhouse. When it comes to a key situation, he can't get himself to concern himself with getting the job done instead of how it looks. Alex monopolized all the attention. When Alex came over, he certainly changed just the feel of the club. And he needs all those statistics he needs every record imaginable."" Now, what's your overall view here? TORRE: I can't disagree with any of that. I mean Alex is a special player. I don't think there's any player that's more talented than Alex Rodriguez. He cares very deeply about doing well. Baseball is his life. He puts a lot of pressure on himself. And when he first came over, I mean you can't put an Alex Rodriguez into a clubhouse and not think it's going to change, just based on, you know, who he is, his ability and what he's done in the past. King:  But the ""A fraud"" (comment) was... Torre: The A fraud thing was more of a joking-type thing. I know Larry Bowa used to take him out to hit ground balls after he had maybe a bad night or had made an error, and he says, 'Who is it today, is it A-Rod or A-Fraud?' It was right there in front of him. It wasn't like anything was said behind his back. King:  When did you last have contact with A-Rod? Torre: I haven't talked to Alex for a while. I've had, you know, best wishes through people. But, you know, I text him on occasions. But I have not talked to Alex since I left. King: Do you think you'll hear from him? Torre: I don't know. I may. As I say, I don't think there's anything in this book that's going to, you know, make Alex angry. King: You say you never got trust from the Yankee front office, not even when you were winning. You say it bothered you. So were you even, during the winning years, angry inside? Torre: I wouldn't say they didn't trust me. You know, the thing is George, God love him, he, you know, always wanted to go to the whip. George is that kind of owner that, you know, wants to be in total control. And, again, he really didn't give you an opportunity to enjoy what you had done, because he was always striving for the next good thing to happen. King: So then it wasn't fun? Torre: It was exciting. It was exciting, and the winning is fun. King: You have had some tough stuff to say about Steinbrenner. Here's a couple quotes. ""He would be a tyrant who would second-guess a lot of stuff"" that you did. ""He was resentful of the credit I got."" He wanted to scare you in front of other people. It drove him nuts when it made sense when I talked to him. Torre: That's not saying bad things about him. King: That's not? Torre: That's not. All of those things I think George would be proud of, . King: Are you proud of it? Torre: Yes. He liked being the boss. Everybody in the world knows he's tough. They know he, you know, can threaten you at any time, but that was the excitement. The thing that I kept telling George -- I want to make him proud of what we are doing, and for a long period of time, we did do that. King: On steroids, you write you never saw it. Players never talked about it. You said you respected guys' privacy? Torre: I always did that, even before the steroid issue. I never went in players lockers or tried to sneak around the corner. In regards to steroids, I think we're all to blame, all of baseball. I never realized how far reaching this problem has been. I'm not saying that we as managers and coaches, that you don't look across the field and said, 'you know, this guy has gotten big from last year, and stuff like that.' But again, it's not like loading a bat. I was always a little hesitant to accuse people of loading a bat to hit a ball farther. I was always very hesitant to approach people because I never had any evidence that I had firsthand knowledge of.","Former Yankee skipper Joe Torre defends comments made in new book .

"(CNN) -- Dutch fighter jets scrambled Wednesday to intercept a pair of Russian military aircraft that entered their airspace, a fairly routine action that comes amid heightened tensions between Russia and NATO, a Dutch official said. Maj. Wilko Ter Horst said that the military learned around 3:50 p.m. (9:50 a.m. ET) that two Russian TU-95 bombers, known as Bears, had come a half-mile inside its airspace. A pair of Dutch F-16 military jets were then dispatched to escort the Russian planes and ""ensure they (flew) out of our airspace,"" said Ter Horst, a Dutch military spokesman. Such a sequence of events isn't uncommon, with the Netherlands military spokesman explaining ""this is a national procedure when aircraft infringe (on) national Dutch airspace."" He estimated Dutch fighter jets scramble to check out unknown aircraft -- be they from Russia or another country -- about four or five times a year. ""It is not unusual,"" Ter Horst added. ""Sometimes they cross Dutch airspace and sometimes they stay north of Dutch airspace (in the country's so-called area of responsibility)."" In this case, British military aircraft took over from the Dutch in escorting the Russian planes. A British Defense Ministry spokesman said that planes from his military left from Royal Air Force station Leuchars ""to determine the identity of unknown aircraft that approached the NATO Air Policing Area north of Scotland and could not be identified by other means."" These planes were later identified as the Russian military planes. The spokesman stressed that they didn't enter British airspace, nor has any Russian military plane ever done so. ""The Russian military aircraft remained in international airspace at all times, as they are perfectly entitled to do,"" the spokesman said. In a separate and ""standard"" event, Britain's HMS Dragon met up with the Russian ship Vice Admiral Kulakov as it was ""transiting past the UK,"" according to the military spokesman. The British naval destroyer is now ""keeping an eye on its transit south,"" he added. There was no immediate mention of this story on the English-language versions of at least two Russian state-run media outlets, RT and RIA Novosti. While British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said his military is always on alert ""to intercept any non-NATO forces,"" he did not portray these specific incidents as alarming. ""Recent events have increased awareness of Russian military activity,"" Hammond said. ""But we have always routinely intercepted, identified and escorted Russian air and naval assets that transit international airspace and waters within the UK's 'area of interest.'"" Both the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are part of NATO, which has been increasingly at odds with Russia over its activity in and around Ukraine. The tensions ratcheted up late last year, when demonstrators pushed out Ukraine's president in part due to their anger about his moving away from an alliance with Europe and moving closer to Russia. A pro-Western government took over in Kiev. Soon after, the Crimean peninsula seceded from Ukraine and became part of Russia. Since then, Russia has deployed what NATO estimates to be 40,000 troops near its border with Ukraine, which has made other countries in the area nervous. In an interview Wednesday with RT, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia would ""certainly respond"" if its interests were attacked in Ukraine. ""Russian citizens being attacked is an attack against the Russian Federation,"" Lavrov said. Dutch fighter jets intercept cargo plane .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Nearly a year after assassins killed Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, her widower won the country's presidential election and hailed his triumph as a victory for democracy. ""I feel democracy has been vindicated,"" Asif Ali Zardari told CNN. ""I feel we are coming closer to her [Benazir Bhutto's] mission of total democracy in Pakistan. And we shall take the oath of office of President in the name of Shahid Benazir Bhutto, and that will be a momentous occasion for all the democratic forces in the world."" Zardari, 53, had been the front-runner in the race to replace former President Pervez Musharraf, who was forced to resign last month. Zardari is to be inaugurated on Tuesday and would take office the same day.  Watch an analyst discuss the election » . The election was not by public vote, but rather by lawmakers in the two houses of the National Assembly and in the four provincial assemblies around the country. Under Pakistan's constitution, the president is elected by a majority vote.  Watch Zardari discuss his challenges » . According to the chief election commissioner of Pakistan, Qazi Muhammad Farooq, Zardari received 481 votes. Retired Chief Justice Muhammad Saeed Uzaman Saddiqi received 153 votes and Senator Mushahid Hussain received 44 votes, Farooq said. ""The democracy talks, and everybody hears,"" Zardari said in a televised address Saturday evening. ""And to those who would say the People's Party or the presidency would be controversial under our guardianship and under our stewardship, I would say, listen to democracy."" The president-elect said he would hand over many responsibilities to the parliament. ""Parliament is sovereign, this president shall be subservient to the parliament,"" he said in the televised address. Watch why not everyone is celebrating Zardari's win » . ""It is the philosophy of ... Benazir Bhutto, in which we believe, which says democracy is the best revenge,"" Zadari said. ""She taught us how to live. She taught us how to do politics."" The pro-American Zardari will rule a nuclear power threatened by Islamic militancy and economic turmoil. The Taliban are resurgent in Pakistan and the country's economy is tanking. Zardari took over Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) after her death late last year. His party had been confident of a win, saying Zardari had the support of three of the four provincial assemblies -- which would be crucial in helping Zardari forge the alliances he needs to tackle the country's main problems. Hussain, who was a close aide to the ex-president, was representing Musharraf's Pakistan Muslim League-Q. The party had painted him as a candidate who represented the middle class and has a clean track record -- in contrast to Zardari, who spent 11 and a half years in jail on corruption charges that he refutes. Siddiqui was nominated by the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Musharraf resigned under intense political pressure last month as the ruling coalition began taking steps to impeach him. He had swept to power in 1999 in a bloodless coup. The chairman of the upper house of the assembly, Mohammedmian Soomro, has been acting president in the meantime. Saturday's election came one day after Pakistan's Supreme Court reinstated three of its judges who Musharraf ousted in November, following his imposition of emergency rule. The PPP had formed a coalition with Sharif's party, the PML-N, but the coalition split apart August 25. The PML-N had set that date as a deadline for the government to honor its promise to reinstate the judges who were fired. The PPP, which led the coalition, said it believed the coalition should focus on picking a successor for Musharraf before it decided on reinstating the judges. At least 60 judges were arrested after Musharraf issued his order. Some were jailed, others placed under house arrest. Security around the National Assembly building in Islamabad was tight, with police on the roof and at the gates and riot police on site. As the voting took place, a suicide car bomb exploded in northwestern Pakistan, killing at least 25 people, including eight police officers, local police spokesman Fazal Karim said. Eight-one others were wounded. The explosion happened at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Peshawar, about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from the Provincial Assembly in Pakistan, where some of the presidential voting was taking place. Peshawar is the capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. The province is near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan and is rife with Islamic extremists.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Pro-pot groups cheered passage of referendums legalizing recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington state as the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in their 50-year campaign to make the drug legal nationwide. ""Yesterday's elections have forever changed the playing field regarding cannabis prohibition laws in America (and probably in large parts of the world, too),"" Allen St. Pierre, executive director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, wrote in a celebratory blog Wednesday. But Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper warned it's too soon to ""break out the Cheetos,"" because his state must still navigate federal laws before citizens can legally buy and sell cannabis. Highs and lows of using marijuana . The Drug Enforcement Administration quickly tried to spoil the Rocky Mountain high, issuing a statement Wednesday morning saying the DEA's ""enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act remains unchanged."" ""In enacting the Controlled Substances Act, Congress determined that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance,"" the DEA statement said. ""The Department of Justice is reviewing the ballot initiatives, and we have no additional comment at this time."" Voters in Massachusetts -- and possibly Montana, pending final vote counts -- also approved medical marijuana referendums, allowing doctors to prescribe the drug to patients suffering serious medical problems, which were carefully spelled out. Colorado, Washington pass marijuana legalization; Oregon says no . In Massachusetts, a doctor who has a ""bona fide"" relationship with a patient would have to certify the patient suffered ""a debilitating medical condition, such as cancer, glaucoma, HIV-positive status or AIDS, hepatitis C, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, or multiple sclerosis."" Medical marijuana is already legal in 17 states, including California, where it was estimated two years ago that Los Angeles County had more medical marijuana shops than liquor stores. Salesmen invited tourists walking along the Venice Beach boardwalk into a store, next to the T-shirt and sunglasses stall, to see a doctor who would give them a marijuana license and prescription. The smell of burning cannabis wafted through the air along Hollywood streets and neon green crosses marked where citizens could get their pot supplies. In the past two years, however, local city councils have enacted restrictions on where the shops can locate, forcing many to close. ""Some medical marijuana clinics have been taken over by illegal for-profit businesses that sell recreational marijuana to healthy young adults and attract crime,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said in September. Federal prosecutors have aggressively worked to rein in the proliferation of pot distribution locations, contending the operations draw criminals because of the large amounts of cash involved. Three forfeiture lawsuits were filed and warning letters were sent to 71 ""illegal marijuana stores"" in Los Angeles and Huntington Park, California, in September by federal authorities. Voters approve same-sex marriage for the first time . Last month, a federal grand jury indicted 14 people ""associated with a chain of nine marijuana stores"" in Orange and Los Angeles counties on federal drug trafficking charges. The indictment included tax evasion and weapons charges. NORML's main argument is that marijuana is ""far less dangerous than alcohol or tobacco,"" which are the only recreational drugs more popular than pot in the United States. ""Marijuana is nontoxic and cannot cause death by overdose,"" while hundreds of thousands die from tobacco and alcohol use each year, NORML's website says. Legalization could save U.S. taxpayers the $10 billion spent each year on enforcing marijuana prohibition, and eliminate the criminal cases against more than 750,000 people arrested per year for possession, which NORML says is ""far more than the total number of arrestees for all violent crimes combined, including murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault."" ""The voters have spoken and we have to respect their will,"" Colorado Gov. Hickenlooper said in a written statement released by his office. ""This will be a complicated process, but we intend to follow through. That said, federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug, so don't break out the Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly,"" he said, referring to two snack food products. Marijuana could be legal across Colorado within two months, according to a spokesman for the governor's office. The 536 medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado could begin selling to the general public then, according to University of Denver law professor Sam Kamin. Whether the federal government allows that to happen is ""a billion dollar question,"" Kamin said. ""Every store that sells marijuana here is violating federal law,"" he said. ""The federal government could come in and seize assets. They could charge people criminally. They could send people to jail for scores of years. They have chosen, so far, not to do that."" With almost half the states now legalizing marijuana to some degree, the federal government will have to make a decision, he said. ""It simply can't go on the way it is,"" Kamin said. ""It can't be a big industry and a Federal crime at the same time."" Highs and lows of using marijuana . Amendment 64 in Colorado will alter the state constitution to legalize and regulate the production, possession, and distribution of marijuana for people age 21 and older. The Washington state measure includes a 25% tax imposed when the grower sells marijuana to a processor, again when the processor sells it to a retailer, and a third time when the retailer sells it to a customer. Supporters estimated it would raise as much as $500 million for the state -- a figure analysts say is overstated. While Washington and Colorado voters became the first to legalize marijuana for recreational use, a similar proposal was rejected in Oregon Tuesday. And Arkansas voters narrowly said no to a medical marijuana referendum similar to the one that passed in Massachusetts. ""Will there continue to be fits and starts, federal government incursion into state sovereignty and obstinate politicians?"" NORML's St. Pierre wrote. ""Surely. However, the dye for major cannabis law reforms is now cast."" ""The proverbial light at the end of the tunnel is before us all."" CNN's Stephanie Oswald contributed to this report.","Votes have ""forever changed the playing field"" on marijuana laws, NORML says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki confirmed Tuesday that the Obama administration is considering a controversial plan to make veterans pay for treatment of service-related injuries with private insurance. Lawmakers say they'd reject a proposal to make veterans pay for treatment of war wounds with private insurance. But the proposal would be ""dead on arrival"" if it's sent to Congress, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said. Murray used that blunt terminology when she told Shinseki that the idea would not be acceptable and would be rejected if formally proposed. Her remarks came during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs about the 2010 budget. No official proposal to create such a program has been announced publicly, but veterans groups wrote a pre-emptive letter last week to President Obama voicing their opposition to the idea after hearing the plan was under consideration. The groups also cited an increase in ""third-party collections"" estimated in the 2010 budget proposal -- something they said could be achieved only if the Veterans Administration started billing for service-related injuries. Asked about the proposal, Shinseki said it was under ""consideration."" ""A final decision hasn't been made yet,"" he said. Currently, veterans' private insurance is charged only when they receive health care from the VA for medical issues that are not related to service injuries, like getting the flu. Charging for service-related injuries would violate ""a sacred trust,"" Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis said. Davis said the move would risk private health care for veterans and their families by potentially maxing out benefits paying for costly war injury treatments. A second senator, North Carolina Republican Richard Burr, said he agreed that the idea should not go forward. ""I think you will give that up"" as a revenue stream if it is included in this April's budget, Burr said. Murray said she'd already discussed her concerns with the secretary the previous week. ""I believe that veterans with service-connected injuries have already paid by putting their lives on the line,"" Murray said in her remarks. ""I don't think we should nickel and dime them for their care."" Eleven of the most prominent veterans organizations have been lobbying Congress to oppose the idea. In the letter sent last week to the president, the groups warned that the idea ""is wholly unacceptable and a total abrogation of our government's moral and legal responsibility to the men and women who have sacrificed so much."" The groups included The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. At the time, a White House spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the option was being considered.","Obama team considering plan in which vets would use private insurance for wounds .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of Vice, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. Motherboard.tv is Vice's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology. The reports, which are being produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- It can't be very hard for Bertrand Piccard to explain to his family why he wants to fly around the world with only sunlight for fuel. In the 1930s, his grandfather, physicist and inventor Auguste Piccard, applied his excitement and interest in ballooning to designing a high-flying balloon attached to a pressurized aluminum gondola. The first of its kind, Auguste's flying machine completed a record-breaking climb more than 50,000 feet into the air, gathering valuable data about the Earth's upper atmosphere along the way. Fitting that Bertrand, for what it's worth, defeated the notorious Sir Richard Branson by becoming the first man to circumnavigate the globe in a balloon in 1999. His grandfather's pioneering principles of balloon technology were eventually applied to allow descent into the deep ocean, which informed the work of his father, Jacques Piccard, an oceanographer and engineer who made history in 1960 as part of the first and only manned exploration of the Challenger Deep, the deepest place in the ocean. The work of his family would provide the vision -- and the name -- for Gene Roddenberry's Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who would seem to exercise some influence over the real Piccard too. Bertrand's enthusiasm for adventure, morally sound intuition and haircut seem directly taken from Roddenberry's description of the fictional spaceship captain. Bertrand believes that as much as the world is locked into short term ways of thinking, there are positive and optimistic solutions that are profitable, protect the environment, create jobs and help economic growth. To fulfill his own vision, Bertrand has applied his and his family's pioneering spirit and brilliance to develop Solar Impulse, a solar-powered long-range glider to fly around the world and to harness an unlimited form of renewable energy using technologies that won't contribute to daunting environmental concerns. Think of him as Icarus in reverse. Watch the rest of Solar Plane at Motherboard.tv . Bertrand's dream is already coming to fruition. Last July, the Solar Impulse became the first solar-powered airplane ever to fly through a complete daylight cycle. The goal is to one day be able to develop a solar plane capable of carrying multiple passengers, but don't try to book a flight just yet. Andre Borschberg, who's been working with Bertrand since 2003, says that while it's possible to make it around the world with one person on board the Solar Impulse now, ""it will take more time for new technologies to allow passengers to fly without [creating] any pollution."" With a more than 200-foot wingspan and weighing in at less than 4000 pounds -- the weight of a mid-sized car -- the Solar Impulse has been designed entirely with energy conservation in mind. In fact, the remarkably resourceful aircraft uses roughly the same amount of energy that the Wright brothers' illustrious flying machine required to power in 1903. Its state of the art propulsion system is made up of four motors containing polymer lithium batteries and a heat management system designed to conserve heat at high altitudes. Coupled with an onboard computing system that gathers and analyzes flight management procedures, the Solar Impulse's likeness to the Wright Flyer is only superficial. It's hard to imagine what the look on Orville and Wilbur's faces would be if only they could see what their design has inspired. In the sixth episode of Motherboard's Upgrade! series, we travel back to Geneva, Switzerland, to talk to Bertrand about his vision for Solar Impulse, the impact it could have on the world and why, if we can't think and act sustainably, generations to come will be forced to face the growing dilemma our current way of life is creating in our increasingly fragile environment.","Solar Impulse aircraft is a solar powered, long-range glider .

There is a consensus in Britain that at least 500 young Brits have gone to the Middle East as jihadists. There is a clear belief, stated by Prime Minister David Cameron, that the ISIS fighter who executed journalist James Foley on videotape is British. This harkens back 12 years to the beheading of another American journalist, Daniel Pearl, and the fact that a British-Pakistani has been sentenced to death as one of the perpetrators. The three British newspapers devoted page after page to exploring the scale of British terrorist recruitment, the danger that the terrorists will come home, and clear warnings from the security forces that they will be overwhelmed if they come home in an organized manner. Something profound is happening when a vicious, radical movement can recruit that many young men from a society that was housing, feeding and educating them. This represents a repudiation of the idea of assimilation on a scale and intensity that will lead to profound public policy changes. Cameron cut short his vacation and returned to London for emergency meetings. He indicated quite clearly that he was prepared to expand anti-terrorist policies and make them even more aggressive. It is already illegal in Britain even to look at video such as the beheading of James Foley. This would clearly be unconstitutional in the United States, but it indicates the seriousness with which the British take the threat of radical Islamists. The British have already begun suspending passports of young men who wanted to go to Syria or Iraq. They have also made it illegal to belong to ISIS. President Obama has taken a lot of grief for reading his statement about the killing of James Foley and then going to play golf. At least one newspaper put a picture on its front page of the President laughing in his golf cart next to a picture of Foley's grieving parents. Having now read the President's statement and compared it to the reality of 500-plus young Britons joining ISIS, I think he may have been lucky that people were too irritated by his schedule to pay attention to his statement. I urge you to read President Obama's full text. It isn't very long. The most delusional line is his assertion that ""people like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy."" Of course it is freedom and the rule of law that have been rare throughout history, and tyranny and lawlessness that have been common. ISIS and the ideology it represents won't just wear themselves out. One has to wonder whether the President understands how serious a threat ISIS presents. ISIS is a fact. It is a religiously motivated movement that uses terror as one of its weapons. Beheading people is nothing new in history. ISIS is much more than a terrorist organization. It is making money out of trading in oil and grain. It is making money from robbing banks and selling stolen artifacts. It is running a significant part of Syria and Iraq. More important than ISIS itself is the larger movement it represents. It is recruiting people from many countries. As I have written before, from Boko Haram in Nigeria to Hamas in Palestine to ISIS in Syria and Iraq, we are seeing the same kind of transnational religious radicalism metastasize into a deep commitment to destroy our way of life. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey said, this is ""an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated"" -- and a vision that could ""fundamentally alter the face of the Middle East and create a security environment that would certainly threaten us in many ways."" The British reports on the number of terrorists they are producing and the potential threat they represent should sober all of us. Unfortunately, the Obama administration has no strategy for dealing with a threat of that scale.","Newt Gingrich: At least 500 young Brits have gone to the Middle East as jihadists .

"(CNN) -- President Obama renewed his call to improve the nation's ""crumbling"" infrastructure during his State of the Union address Tuesday, saying it will create jobs and help the nation compete in the global economy. Singling out roads, bridges and railways, Obama said the U.S. ""infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped."" ""Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do,"" the president said. ""China is building faster trains and newer airports."" Obama hammered home its importance by comparing his proposal to famously successful infrastructure programs of the past: the transcontinental railroad, the interstate highway system and the spread of electricity to rural America. ""The jobs created by these projects didn't just come from laying down tracks or pavement,"" Obama said. ""They came from businesses that opened near a town's new train station or the new offramp."" Obama set a goal of offering 80% of Americans access to faster railroad trains by 2036. He touted it as allowing passengers to ""go places in half the time it takes to travel by car."" ""For some trips, it will be faster than flying -- without the pat down,"" he joked, referring to recent public criticism of airport security procedures. Perhaps in an attempt to ward off criticism about rising federal spending, Obama said the projects would be ""fully paid for"" and would ""attract private investment."" Projects would be chosen ""based on what's best for the economy, not politicians,"" he said. But Washington's current high-speed rail proposal may have a fatal economic flaw, according to infrastructure expert R. Richard Geddes, of the American Enterprise Institute think tank. Many of the high-speed passenger trains would run on existing rails, which are now used by the nation's freight train industry. Interruptions in freight traffic, Geddes said, could potentially cost tens of billions of dollars per year in lost value to the U.S. economy. Building special rail lines dedicated to the 110-mph passenger trains could cost as much as $50 million per mile, he said. ""Whatever we do with the passenger rail system, we cannot afford to mess up our freight train system in the United States,"" Geddes said. The prohibitive cost makes it more economically feasible to limit high-speed rail to regions with high populations, like the Northeast, Geddes said. Funding . Included in the White House statement were details about how public and private funds would be combined to pay for these projects, including ""transformational investments such as an infrastructure bank that will revolutionize infrastructure finance"" by ""leveraging government resources through attracting private capital."" So far, the Department of Transportation has awarded $8 billion as a ""down payment"" to begin developing projects in at least a dozen states. Newly elected governors in Wisconsin and Ohio have balked at the rail programs, prompting Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to redirect Wisconsin's $810 million and Ohio's $400 million to other states. California is getting the lion's share of the funds -- $624 million for its link between Los Angeles and San Francisco. About $342 million is going to Florida, and the remainder will be divided among Washington and 10 other states. This was not the first time Obama has rallied the nation to renew its commitment to infrastructure. Last year, backed by a group of governors and mayors, the president proposed a six-year $50 billion infrastructure development plan. Although he didn't specifically mention Obama's infrastructure initiative during the official GOP response to the State of the Union address, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, did target White House spending proposals that he said cost too much.  ""Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25% for domestic government agencies, an 84% increase when you include the failed stimulus,"" he said. ""All of this new government spending was sold as 'investment.' Yet after two years, the unemployment rate remains above 9%, and government has added over $3 trillion to our debt.""  Internet gap . This slipping U.S. infrastructure, Obama said, also includes the internet. Pointing out that South Korea enjoys greater internet access than the United States, the president called for a National Wireless Initiative, which aims to extend wireless internet coverage to 98% of the U.S. population. South Korea has some of the fastest and most available broadband connections on the planet, according to a 2011 report from Akamai Technologies. The United States ranked ninth in fastest high-speed broadband connectivity, just below Belgium and above Canada. Current internet usage by Americans is around 75%, said Jim Harper of the CATO Institute, a Washington-based conservative think tank. ""There are people -- who could very well get broadband -- who don't want it. Where there isn't demand, we shouldn't have government policies trying to push it there because that's just going to waste resources."" Federal officials should free up more of the airwaves' electromagnetic spectrum for use by private wireless internet providers as a way to increase broadband access and competition among businesses, said Harper. He agrees that internet access is directly related to a stronger economy. ""If you're able to access information more quickly, then that increases productivity -- especially in an economy like ours which is increasingly a knowledge-based economy,"" he said. The White House, in a statement released Tuesday, said greater internet access ""will enable businesses to grow faster, students to learn more, and public safety officials to access state-of-the-art, secure, nationwide, and interoperable mobile communications."" CNN's Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this report.","Obama calls on Congress to redouble efforts to rebuild infrastructure .

"Washington (CNN) -- The American Petroleum Institute has a message to Congress as it starts work Wednesday: Open more areas for drilling and we will create more jobs for the American people. ""With the right policies in place at all levels of government, our industry stands ready to be the engine of economic growth and recovery this country needs in 2011 and well beyond,"" said the industry group's chief, Jack Gerard, in a speech Tuesday. The institute commissioned a study that says if the government will sign off on a plan to open the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, portions of the Rocky Mountains, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Atlantic and Pacific Outer Continental Shelf to oil and natural gas exploration and production, the industry can create 530,000 jobs by 2025. But critics of previous plans to open vast areas to drilling have disputed industry reports about job creation, citing increasing production of drilling equipment outside the United States and a shortage of refineries in the United States that could limit the amount of oil sold in the country. Additionally, according to the Department of Energy, oil companies are sitting on nearly 70 million acres of leases they are not drilling, and America's oil refineries are not operating at their capacity because demand is lower. ""It's hard to say they create jobs when you look at the oil spill in the Gulf and see how they destroyed jobs,"" said Joe Mendelson, director of Global Warming Policy at the National Wildlife Foundation. ""We've certainly seen in the Gulf that when drilling offshore and things go wrong, they have a domino effect on the economy and the regions that depend on the other natural resources,"" said Mendelson. But Gerard said he is concerned that if oil and gas companies cannot drill in U.S. territory or if that ability to drill is restricted, companies will take their infrastructure and jobs elsewhere. ""We've already seen some companies send their idled Gulf rigs to waters off the coast of Africa and South America -- and other companies are discussing plans to relocate their Gulf rigs,"" he said. Mendelson agreed that job creation is important but said the renewable energy industry will create jobs that have less potential for an environmental disaster. ""The renewable energy industry is one of the fastest growing industry sectors and it can create jobs that keep us competitive in the world and that are much healthier for our country,"" he said. T. Boone Pickens, a former oil and gas executive and current proponent of alternative energy, said that while he disagrees with much of the institute's study, it did get one thing right. ""America has an ever-increasing supply of natural gas and those reserves and development of untapped shale resources should be utilized to meet expanding energy needs, especially in power generation,"" he said. Gerard said the Department of Interior is delaying the process of granting offshore leases for exploration and drilling, has placed large areas off limits and is slow to issue permits in areas where exploration and drilling are currently allowed. The Department of Interior and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement dispute Gerard's statement that they are slow to issue permits or that they are opposed to offshore drilling. In fact, according to the Interior Department, there are more than 42 million acres in the Outer Continental Shelf that are leased and available for permitting. ""We remain focused on raising the bar for safety and environmental protection in offshore drilling, while also continuing to take aggressive steps to strengthen the agency responsible for overseeing offshore energy production,"" Interior spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said. ""Outer Continental Shelf decisions will continue to be based on science, public input and an open and transparent process."" Ocean Energy Management spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said there have been a significant number of shallow water permits approved and that they are accepting applications for deepwater permits. However, she said oil companies have not requested many deepwater permits since the moratorium was lifted in October. ""There have only been two permits submitted for new deepwater wells since October 12, one of those is for activity that had been allowed under the moratorium. That means that there is only one application for a new deepwater well,"" said Schwartz. At one time, the Obama administration was actively trying to increase the area available to oil and gas companies for exploration and drilling as part of a strategy to become less reliant on foreign energy. In March 2010, President Barack Obama and U.S. Department of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced a plan to expand oil and gas development along the Outer Continental Shelf and the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. ""By responsibly expanding conventional energy development and exploration here at home we can strengthen our energy security, create jobs and help rebuild our economy,"" said Salazar. But the April 2010 explosion and subsequent spill at BP's Macondo Oil Field in the Gulf of Mexico stopped those expansion plans. The Department of Interior later issued a moratorium on deepwater drilling that lasted until October 12. There was no moratorium on shallow water drilling as it was deemed less risky. Gerard said that incidents like the BP spill are rare and the oil and gas industry is committed to improving safety, but said the oil and gas industry can work on improving safety, explore new resources and create jobs all at the same time. ""More domestic production of oil and natural gas both onshore and offshore is critical to jobs for all Americans, a stronger economy (and) an enhanced energy security,"" he said.","Oil industry promises hundreds of thousands of jobs if Congress opens more areas to drilling .
Department of Energy says millions of acres are leased now and not being drilled .
Interior Department says oil companies aren't applying for deepwater drilling now ."
"(CNN) -- Auburn University officials got their first glimmer of hope Friday since they received word that that school's beloved live oak trees had been poisoned with a massive dose of the virulent herbicide Spike 80DF. A task force made up of horticulturists, agronomists and engineers had determined that the area directly adjacent to the trees does not show high concentrations of the dangerous toxin, Auburn spokeswoman Deedie Dowdle said. ""We were very concerned that the herbicide would spread. This particular one has been known to kill everything in a very large area, up to an acre,"" Dowdle said. Dowdle said that new, clean soil mixed with activated charcoal was installed around the trees. The charcoal's purpose is to try to pull away any remaining herbicide in the soil, she said. Workers began removing the highly contaminated dirt earlier in the week, after conducting extensive tests to see just how far the poison traveled through the grounds. As a precaution, the workers were also removing several areas outside beds around the trees that have shown elevated levels. Although it's unknown how much of the poison the live oak roots took in, Dowdle said the task force was encouraged with their progress. ""Obviously we're very concerned about the trees, given that they were given 65 times the dose than what would be necessary to kill them,"" she said. ""But they feel a bit better. We had thought there was virtually no chance, and now we're just hoping."" Auburn police arrested Harvey Updyke Jr., 62, last week for allegedly dousing the landmark trees with herbicide so potent that agronomists said the two 130-year-old trees on Toomer's Corner have little to no chance of survival. Updyke has been charged with one count of criminal mischief and has been released on $50,000 bail. ""At this time, we have no other suspects,"" Auburn Police Chief Tommy Dawson said Friday. Updyke has cycled through three court-appointed lawyers and is currently being represented by Glennon Threatt Jr., a Birmingham-based attorney, according to court documents. Attorney Jerry M. Blevins said Tuesday that he was retained on the matter last week but withdrew from the case, based on ""some conflicts between me and Mr. Updyke."" Updyke's two previous court-appointed attorneys were allowed to withdraw because of their affiliations with Auburn University. Authorities first learned of the herbicide after a caller who identified himself as ""Al from Dadeville"" phoned into a Birmingham, Alabama, radio talk show, saying he had poisoned the renowned live oaks after Auburn won a contentious November football game against the University of Alabama. ""Al"" ended the call with ""Roll Damn Tide,"" a battle cry for the University of Alabama. Fans typically gather around the trees after victories, draping them with toilet paper, said Mike Clardy, Auburn University spokesman. Clardy said it's not just Auburn supporters who have rallied around the trees, however. ""We've had hundreds of calls of encouragement and suggestions from other schools in the SEC, including from the University of Alabama,"" he said, referring to the Southeastern Conference, which includes Auburn and the University of Alabama. Friday, a Facebook page called ""Tide for Toomer's"" said more than $47,000 had been raised in support of the historic trees. Dowdle said that sum, combined with the amounts contributed through Auburn and its partnerships, brings the total donation to more than $100,000. ""Isn't that fantastic?"" Dowdle said. ""On the field, there's a tremendous rivalry, but off the field, there's a tremendous respect."" Student body presidents of the longtime rival schools announced earlier in the week an initiative to plant sister trees on each other's campuses, in an expression of joint unity. ""Our rivalry is more than a game. It's a partnership. More times than not, it unites us instead of dividing us,"" James Fowler of Alabama said. The unity trees will be planted within the next months. The next step for the Toomer's Corner trees, Dowdle said, is to see whether the live oaks produce leaves come spring. ""Depending how long the poison was in the soil and taken up by the roots, in spite of the rain,"" she said. ""We're just going to wait and see. Everybody is giving it their all.""","The 130-year-old live oaks were poisoned with a massive dose of a virulent herbicide .

"(CNN) -- Don't run, Hillary. Nobody is saying the former secretary of state, New York senator, U.S. and Arkansas first lady, and Yale-trained attorney is not qualified for the White House. In fact, she may have one of the most impressive rÃ©sumÃ©s to ever be submitted for the job. Clinton has a breadth of experience that indicates she has every capability needed to be president of the United States. But it is time for America to move on. The first argument against another Clinton candidacy is generational. Baby boomers need to release their arthritic fingers from the torch of leadership and pass it off to another generation. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama will have accounted for 24 years of the presidency by 2016, which seems more than sufficient. Clinton's election potentially extends boomer influence in a manner that risks creating a generation gap that further increases political disaffection among young voters. Age is another important consideration, regardless of howls of outrage on this question by her supporters. Clinton would be 69 when she raised her right hand for the oath of office. She would be the second-oldest person to become president -- younger than Ronald Reagan by several months. The pressures of the White House amplify the afflictions of time. Arguably, an optimal president combines an earned wisdom and natural intellect with the residual energy of youth. No one does this by turning 70 during their first year as president, which would be Clinton's status. How long can Hillary Clinton wait? Although doctors pronounced her perfectly healthy after a recent scare with a blood clot on the brain, the probabilities of geriatric disease in office are very real for someone who might be 77 at the end of a second term. Reagan's comportment during his last years suggests that he had already begun moving behind the veil of Alzheimer's. This is not ageism. An accumulation of years defines our range of capabilities, physically and intellectually, and the Clintons as well as the nation need to confront the question of whether a person in their mid-70s is the best to serve as president. The obvious answer is no. There is, nonetheless, no underestimating the cultural importance of the first female president and the glory it will bestow upon history's grandest democracy. The Democratic Party, too, will have an interest in being the political organization that gave the country its first female as well as African-American presidents. Clinton, who is properly positioned with experience, has other challenges that impede her getting a chapter in future textbooks as the first woman in the Oval Office. America is weary of limited political choices and dynasties. A second Clinton presidency might culminate in 28 years of Clinton-Bush control. We are, more than ever, a nation that desperately needs to renew itself with what is different and hopeful and visionary. Unfortunately, there is too much that is predictable with a second Clinton candidacy. No one needs a time machine to look into the future and see the grainy video in TV attack ads with a baritone voice rattling on about Benghazi or mumblings about how her husband enriched himself by accumulating a net worth of $55 million since leaving office. Hillary on possible presidency: 'I'm realistic' ""Don't the Clintons have enough?"" the voice would ask. ""And hasn't America had enough of the Clintons?"" In spite of the fact that Clinton's accomplishments as secretary of state are significant, including diplomatic efforts that averted a war between Israel and Hamas, she is likely to be forced to endure campaign onslaughts accusing her of character flaws for forgiving her husband's indiscretions, which means the electorate probably has to endure at least some painful flashbacks. This is not, however, a recommendation to back away from a fight. Clinton has proved that her political knuckles are toughened with gristle, and she can skillfully marginalize absurd allegations from her opponents. Instead of running and winning a fierce campaign, there might be a more honorable endeavor for the former secretary of state. There is always a right moment to leave the stage, and failing to recognize that timing can lead to a lingering image that, in the longer term, overwhelms the accomplishments of a person in the prime of their powers. Hillary Clinton can make a gracious exit. Yes, she has every right to run for president and is brilliantly qualified for the job. That does not mean, however, she is the best person at this time in America's narrative. There is also nothing inexorable about anyone's presidential candidacy, regardless of how vehemently it is argued by Clinton's backers. Presumptive candidacies, which appear initially like logical choices that are the consequence of devotion and hard politics, often tend toward failure. The Dole, McCain and Romney nominations, presumed candidates with generationally disconnected politics, have sundered the GOP's power for possibly decades. Running for president because it is expected and seems like an obvious decision are clearly not the right motivations. Clinton's service to her country has already transcended even the starry-eyed youthful dreams she shared with her husband. Beyond her time in office as U.S. senator, and as secretary of state, and as counsel to Bill during his presidency, the namesake foundation she leads with her husband and daughter is having a profound impact in this country and internationally, facilitating education, health care and nutritional programs. That nonprofit needs her guidance and initiative. America, though, is ready for different choices representing a new generation for president. Don't run, Hillary. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James C. Moore.","James Moore: Hillary Clinton is brilliantly qualified to be president .
Moore: But it is time for America to move on to a new generation of leaders .

"(CNN) -- My daily trek to work is the last place I would expect to encounter a hateful message. But anti-Islam blogger Pamela Geller is determined to make that happen to me and my fellow commuters. This week, at 10 subway stations around New York, commuters will encounter ads from the virulently anti-Islam group headed by Geller, the American Freedom Defense Initiative. Geller has been cited both by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center for her anti-Muslim activity. The subway ads say, ""In Any War Between the Civilized Man and the Savage, Support the Civilized Man."" Below that are the words: ""Support Israel. Defeat Jihad,"" with a Star of David on either side of the phrases. The coded message makes clear who the savages are: those who support jihad, which in Geller's mind includes all Muslims. She has called Islam ""an extreme ideology, the most radical and extreme ideology on the face of the Earth."" As a rabbi, I find the ads deeply misguided and disturbing. The Jewish community is deep in the heart of our High Holidays, the Ten Days of Repentance that encompass the holy days of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. One of the most powerful moments in the holy days is when the community rises for a recitation of public confession, beginning Tuesday night. I have always been struck by how many of the foibles of daily life have to do with speech. The words from our mouths have power: Once released, whether intentionally or by accident, what we say shapes reality. It can bring about healing or atonement, or it can unleash violence and hatred. Geller's ads, sharply dividing the world into civilized people and savages, are only intended to hurt and tear fragile relationships apart. 'Defeat Jihad' ad to appear in New York subway stations . At first, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rejected the ads, but a district judge ruled the ads were protected under the First Amendment. The ads follow similar ads in San Francisco as well as posters at New York's Metro North train stations that made unsubstantiated claims about the number of people killed in terrorist attacks since 9/11. The Metro North ads denied their bigotry by stating, ""It's not Islamophobia. It's Islamorealism,"" claiming the actions of a few represented the ""reality"" of Islam. But when did it become acceptable to spread bigotry against any American religious, racial or ethnic group in the name of ""realism""? As an American, I believe in the right to free speech, even when I detest the message or disagree vehemently with the messenger. But I can still raise my voice against words of hatred. Moreover, freedom of speech does not absolve our elected officials from denouncing hateful rhetoric. A key part of their jobs as our representatives is to uphold core American values of pluralism and inclusion. Unfortunately, New York City's public officials have largely been silent about the message of hate that will confront all of us during our morning commutes. In a recent radio broadcast, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg explained the court's decision regarding the ads and affirmed the right of freedom of expression as an American value. He said that ""as Americans, we tolerate things that we find despicable,"" but fell short of condemning the ads. I have only to look at the news of the past several months to see how unchecked messages of hatred manifest themselves into acts of violence. The growing number of attacks against mosques in places such as Joplin, Missouri, and the killings in August at the Oak Creek, Wisconsin, Sikh temple are the extreme end of a growing domestic threat against religious minorities. Here in New York, hate crimes surrounding Muslim religious services and at a Holocaust memorial site have been committed. These acts of hatred are not individual tragedies but for all of us as Americans. As a Jew, I know the extreme to which where baseless hatred can lead. And the Jewish community has been in the past a target of hatred in the United States. Geller's message ignores the positive contributions that our Muslim friends, neighbors and colleagues make to our country every single day. It is also unfortunate that Geller chooses to frame her message of hatred as one of support for Israel. The complicated struggle for peace in the Middle East and against terrorism must not be reduced to a simplistic message of a war between good and evil. Although there is considerable debate within the Jewish community about how to best support Israel and achieve peace with her neighbors, it is clear that part of our contribution as Americans is to show the world that religious pluralism is both possible and beneficial for a thriving democracy. In America, no one should have to live in fear for his or her safety because of faith. If there is a silver lining to the events of the past few months, including the subway ads, it is that Americans of all religions have the opportunity to come together and loudly reaffirm their commitments to religious pluralism. Together, we have and will continue to show that speech can also heal. This is our strength. It is time for all of us, regardless of belief, or nonbelief, to stand together and reject stoking bigotry and hatred in our city with these ads. Our goal should be healing, not rupture, and laying the foundation for peace within our community and around the world. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Rachel Kahn-Troster.","Group posts ads in New York subway stations with coded message Islam is ""savage""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- ""The Last Beekeeper"" will change the way you see honeybees. A scene from ""The Last Beekeeper,"" premiering this weekend on the Planet Green cable channel. You may find yourself rescuing a tiny bee you see struggling in a puddle of water. Instead of fearing its sting, you may think about the role honeybees play in putting food on your table. The documentary, which premieres Saturday on the cable channel Planet Green, explores the ""intimate relationship"" between humans and bees through the eyes of three struggling American beekeepers. ""You suddenly realize that even though they look like insects, when you really look at them they take on these personalities,"" said producer Fenton Bailey. Apiarists -- the professional title for bee scientists -- estimate that one out of every three bites of food you eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees. Alarming headlines two years ago about the mysterious disappearance of honeybees prompted filmmakers to follow beekeepers from South Carolina, Montana, and Washington as they traveled with their colonies to pollinate California's massive almond crop. Director Jeremy Simmons said they wanted to show ""more than what was in the paper"" about the mystery. ""There is a really powerful connection between a human being and a bee because we've tended bees for thousand of years,"" Bailey said. ""It's such an old tradition and bees are incredibly sophisticated, evolved creatures."" The cameras rolled as these beekeepers faced ""colony collapse disorder,"" a still unexplained phenomenon which scientists estimate has wiped out almost a third of the domestic honeybee hives in the United States. Nomadic beekeepers truck their bee colonies across the country, following the pollination seasons for almonds, apples, cotton and other crops dependent on their insects. Nicole Ulibarri, who inherited her father's Montana beekeeping business last year, said it's a roller coaster ride for both the bees and the beekeepers. ""You can have a high this month and all of the sudden you can run into something, and the bees start starving to death,"" Ulibarri said. Bees are loaded on trucks in January for a cross-country ride to California to pollinate almonds for a few weeks. Their next stop may be Washington state apple orchards for the spring pollination. The changes interrupt their natural rhythms, Ulibarri said. ""It's like putting you on a strict diet and that's all I feed you for the next month,"" she said. ""And I pick you up and I shake your house and I take you down the road, which is pretty stressful, and then I move you to a new location, and, guess what, for the next six weeks, now, I've changed your temperature and now I'm only going to give you watermelon. You get sick."" The travel also exposes the bees to a variety of pesticides, adding to their stress, she said. And mites, believed to have been brought in by bees that were imported to replace lost hives, are also a problem, she said. The film does not offer an answer to what's killing the honeybees. But Ulibarri said researchers are ""getting real close"" to identifying a virus as the main culprit. In one poignant moment in the documentary, the cameras capture one of the beekeepers breaking down in tears after lying to his wife to hide the fact that he lost most of his bees. ""It's a tragedy, that silent moment in the bee yard when you realize you are surrounded by death,"" Simmons said. ""It's a very powerful, very sad moment."" Along with the loss of their livestock, American beekeepers face tough competition from less expensive imported honey -- especially from China and Argentina, Ulibarri said. She planned to sell her bees after last year's disappointing year, but the prices being offered for them was ""literally nothing."" But this year has been better, with fewer lost colonies, she said. ""Bees really become a part of us, we learn so much all the time,"" she said. ""One really neat thing, when you're around enough hives, as soon as you open it, you can hear from the energy of the hive how they are doing. They are the voice of mother nature.""","""The Last Beekeeper"" documentary premieres Saturday on the Planet Green channel .

"Le Havre, France (CNN) -- Several thousand demonstrators marched through this industrial port city in a mostly peaceful protest against an upcoming summit of the world's group of eight wealthiest countries. Activists from an eclectic mix of labor unions, leftist political parties, and environmentalist and women's rights groups participated in the march through Le Havre's mostly deserted streets, under the slogan ""G-8 Degage."" Degage means ""get lost."" It was also a rallying cry for the revolution in Tunisia last January that toppled Western-backed dictator Zine el Abidine Ben Ali. The protest is being held days ahead of the summit. On Wednesday, leaders from the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, Canada and Russia will converge in the coastal resort of Deauville, more than 20 miles away from Le Havre. ""No, of course they are not welcome here,"" said Baptiste Simon, who held a sign denouncing government cutbacks in social services. ""If it was the G-182, like all of the countries of the United Nations, then they would be welcome here."" ""Deauville is the capital of the grand bourgeoisie in France,"" said union activist Philippe Saunier, referring to Deauville's reputation as an exclusive playground for the French aristocracy. ""It is a symbol of the bourgeoisie."" ""We are part of the protest here because we feel that with all the issues that are being discussed here, whether it be trade or the crisis, it's always that women are left behind, voices of women are never heard,"" said Wilhelmina Trout, a South African activist with the group World March of Women. After marching peacefully for several hours, several younger, black-clad members of the protest began smashing shop windows and spray-painting anarchy signs on store fronts, sending several city residents running in panic down a side street. A half dozen plain-clothes police officers who had infiltrated the march tried to detain one of the suspected vandals. The young man resisted, prompting other anarchists to come to his rescue. They hurled stones at the undercover police officers and chased them as they fled the scene. For the moment, the suspect escaped arrest. Moments later, the anarchists clashed with fellow anti-G8 protesters. They threw paint and oil at security volunteers from one of the largest labor unions organizing the protest when they were barred from entering the main grounds where a concert was to be held. Large international summits and meetings of the world's largest financial institutions are regular targets of anti-globalization demonstrators, whose radical fringes often engage in vandalism and clashes with police. ""We are clearly against violence,"" said Saunier, who was a member of the protest's volunteer security force. ""But there are always some provocateurs."" Though the demonstrators were clearly from the left wing of the political spectrum, there was little to no mention of the disgraced former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Up until his arrest in New York last Saturday, Strauss-Kahn was widely considered to be the French Socialist Party's best hope for wresting the presidency away from Nicholas Sarkozy in next year's presidential election. Saturday's anti-G8 protesters had little positive to say about Strauss-Kahn. ""He's not a good candidate of the left,"" said Saunier, the labor activist. ""He is a member of the grand bourgeoisie,"" he added, referring to Strauss-Kahn's vast wealth, and his residences in Paris, Washington and Morocco, which are widely reported to be worth millions of dollars.","Large demonstration mostly peaceful .

"(CNN) -- ""How much did you weigh when you were born?"" Dr. Alfred Brann asks the first time we talk. It's not a typical, get-to-know-you kind of question, but it seems almost normal coming from Brann. He's a pediatric neurologist who specializes in perinatal medicine and reproductive health in the United States and developing countries. Each year, worldwide, nearly 1 million babies die on the day they are born, according to a new report from Save the Children. Giving birth is also risky for mothers; nearly 800 women die every day during pregnancy or childbirth. While we've made significant strides in reducing child and maternal mortality rates since the 1970s, there are still many lives to save. ""Almost all newborn deaths originate from preventable and treatable causes,"" the report authors write. ""We already have the tools available to save about three-quarters of the newborns who needlessly die each year."" Brann has worked his entire life to ensure that moms and their babies have the best chance of survival. In 1983, he co-wrote the American Academy of Pediatrics' first official ""Guidelines for Perinatal Care,"" which is still being used by doctors to ensure pregnant women and their infants receive quality care. Now, as director of the Global Collaborating Center in Reproductive Health at Emory University in Atlanta, Brann's primary focus is on preventing low birth weight by improving women's health care. Brann recently spoke with CNN about his work and the personal loss that inspired his passion. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: Why are you so passionate about this issue? Dr. Alfred Brann: My mother died during my birth in 1934 in Arkansas. She was 30 when I was born. She was born in the 1900s and she went to college -- unusual for (women at that time). I think if there had been a cesarean section possibility, then my mother would have survived. It was unclear whether she had an old rheumatic heart disease that may have affected a valve. Or ... there was a lot of malaria at the time. The possibility might have been that she had malarial heart disease and was really tired out and couldn't make labor. They had to pull me out. My mother died shortly after that. CNN: What are the most common health issues associated with a low birthweight? Brann: A low-birthweight infant is at greater risk for respiratory distress, bacterial infections, gastrointestinal tract problems and the effects of jaundice. In surviving infants weighing less than 3.5 pounds, problems of neurodevelopmental disabilities include cerebral palsy, impaired mental development, blindness and hearing deficits. CNN: The center at Emory has developed what's called a ""systems approach"" to reducing maternal and infant deaths. Why is that important? Brann: We have to treat the triad of the mother, the fetus and the newborn in a very special, continuous way. There has to be a systems approach to care. (Infant) mortality, you see, we don't have a vaccine to prevent that. It's not like polio; it's not like smallpox. From the moment a little girl is born... all the things that influence her life, all the factors that influence her life, are extremely important. We clearly understand that the missing link in all (maternal and infant deaths) is the absence of women's health. That's not pregnant women's health, you see. It's women's health. It's critical that we change our whole view, that the woman is more than a vessel for making children. Her health is very vital. CNN: What's the goal of the center? Brann: ""The role in those in leadership must be to continuously reevaluate what is unacceptable."" That's (a quote) from the doctor that eradicated smallpox. I've sort of moved from (saving) the high-risk, critical, intensive-care tiny babies to finally asking myself, ""Where are all of these babies coming from, and can we have fewer?"" Yes, we need continued research on finding out why things happen. But there is a moral imperative in implementing what we already know works. And the collaborating center has been about that mission. CNN: What have you've learned working in developing nations? Brann: We've probably ... worked in some 30 different countries. (We are) in active projects right now in Russia and in Mexico. We have been working in Cuba a number of years. Our center is working in places like Afghanistan, and the Central Asian republics, some in sub-Saharan Africa. I've worked in all those regions. The message, I think, there is the fact that if you do not have malaria, then the issues surrounding women's health and pregnancy outcomes -- whether it's in the delta of Mississippi, in south Fulton County in Atlanta, Islamabad, in Beijing, in Havana, in Mexico City -- all around the world, the issues of women's health are the same. CNN: What do you mean? Brann: Women in low-resource settings have difficulty controlling their lives. You didn't choose your parents, and... you didn't choose your color of your skin. You didn't choose the country in which you're born. If you think carefully, that probably influences 90% of our (health) outcomes. We have maybe 10% left. It's just great to be involved in helping to improve a system of health care through which we never ask to come. We work within ministries of health, and also within universities, so that we can help design systems that influence all of the population. CNN: What is most crucial for a woman to have a healthy baby? Not too early, not too many, not too soon and not too late. The best outcome for a healthy pregnancy is to be wanted, planned and have access to prenatal care with appropriate nutrition and delivered by a skilled attendant ... followed by access to modern contraception for appropriate child spacing.","Dr. Alfred Brann is a pediatric neurologist who specializes in perinatal medicine .

"(EW.com) -- Will that final season order get a little smaller? Fox's ""Glee"" fell to a dramatic new low for its fifth season finale Tuesday night. The once-hugely popular musical dramedy dropped to just 1.9 million viewers and a 0.6 ratings among adults 18-49 â€” that's down 38 percent from ""Glee's"" previous series low reached earlier this season. ""Glee"" was even topped in the preliminary ratings by The CW's ""The Originals"" finale, which is inflated slightly due to some baseball preemption in New York City, but The CW says its shows should still beat Fox's lineup in the demo when the final numbers are released. ""Glee"" is ordered for a 22-episode final season that will premiere next year, but earlier this week Fox left open the possibility of that order shrinking. Fox also premiered improv-obstacle course comedy Riot last night to what one analyst called the lowest rating for a series premiere on the Big 4 broadcast network ever. Also Tuesday: The finales for CBS' ""NCIS,"" ""NCIS: LA"" and ""Person of Interest"" were all up from last week. NBC's ""The Voice"" was steady, ""About a Boy"" was up slightly for one episode and tied with last week for its finale, and the finale of ""Chicago Fire"" was steady and up 12 percent from last season's closer.

"New York (CNN) -- He came to London as a young man who loved the Western lifestyle, wanted to make money and have fun. ""American style,"" smiled Abu Hamza al-Masri as he began his testimony Wednesday in his federal trial on terrorism charges. The 56-year-old Egyptian-born al-Masri worked as a bouncer and strip-club manager before bits of Islamic teachings from friends began to penetrate his mind, he testified. The hypocrisy of his lifestyle hit him like a slap in the face. Al-Masri would go on to become the high-profile imam of a London mosque and allegedly inspired several notorious terrorists with his sermons, including failed shoe bomber Richard Reid and 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta. Al-Masri testified he hasn't spoken before a crowd since his 2004 arrest and said a decade in solitary confinement has eroded his memory and grasp of language. The trial has been reinvigorating, said al-Masri, and the preacher drew laughter from the courtroom Wednesday afternoon as he used examples of marital spats to illustrate the practical application of Islamic truth. Al-Masri will continue his testimony Thursday morning. Attorneys for al-Masri have said he may be their only witness. The British cleric pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of terrorism-related charges in 2012. He was extradited to the United States after a lengthy legal battle. The charges against al-Masri involve supporting efforts to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon, sending a young recruit from London to fight alongside al Qaeda on the front lines in Afghanistan, and aiding kidnappers in Yemen with the 1998 abduction of a tour group. ""He was a trainer, a terrorist, and he used the cover of religion so he could hide in plain sight in London,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Kim in his opening statement. Weapons and gas masks were found at al-Masri's London mosque, the prosecutor said: ""Tools of war stockpiled in a place of worship."" The government's three-week case has been an effort to connect the dots between al-Masri and events thousands of miles away from hi, through key witnesses who often had never met the defendant and are testifying as government informants in deals with the prosecution. Defense lawyer Joshua Dratel told the jury in his opening statement that no evidence links the cleric to the alleged crimes -- ""not in Yemen, not in Oregon, not in Afghanistan."" Dratel said his client ""never gave directions or orders to people"" and served merely as a ""commenter on events and issues"" when he lauded the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and celebrated the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""These are ideas, not acts,"" he said. ""These are expressions, not crimes."" Prosecutors called their final witness Wednesday morning to testify about the 1998 kidnapping of 16 tourists in Yemen. Mary Quin traveled with the tour group on the morning of December 28, 1998, when a large group of men in two pickup trucks blocked the road and abducted the travelers. Quin managed to flee after wrestling an AK 47 assault rifle from one of the captors, according to opening statements. Quin testified that she decided to write a book about the ordeal and traveled to London to do research and conduct interviews for the project. She approached al-Masri outside his mosque one Friday morning in the fall of 2000, because he'd stated publicly that he knew the kidnappers, and he agreed to speak to her. When she explained that she was one of the kidnapped tourists, the cleric leaned back in his desk chair and gazed at her, she said. Quin says he told her, ""I'm surprised you would come here. Very surprised."" Al-Masri is alleged to have provided the kidnappers with a satellite phone to use in the incident. In a conversation she recorded at his London mosque, Quin asked if he had provided the phone. ""Yeah, perhaps,"" al-Masri says on the recording, which was played for the jury. In other excerpts of the recorded conversation played in the courtroom, al-Masri can be heard telling Quin that she and the other hostages were intended as ransom for prisoners held by the Yemeni government, possibly including al-Masri's own son and stepson. The leader of the abductors was a ""softhearted person,"" said al-Masri. While al-Masri would not confirm to Quin that he'd known about the kidnapping ahead of time, he did tell her that the perpetrators didn't expect the deadly shootout with government forces. ""We never thought it would be that bad,"" he said. One of Quin's fellow travelers, Margaret Thompson, testified Tuesday about the harrowing kidnapping experience, saying the travelers were used as human shields during a gun battle between her captors and the Yemeni military that left four tourists dead. Thompson was shot in the leg, and walked with a significant limp as she took the stand. A British telecommunications company employee, Paul Anthony Sykes, testified Tuesday that he sold a satellite phone to the defendant several months before the kidnapping. Another pivotal witness against al-Masri was the Seattle man who conceived the idea for a pay-as-you-go jihad training camp on a large patch of barren land outside Bly, Oregon, in 1999. James Ujaama testified he pitched the idea for the camp to the defendant in a fax. ""It looks just like Afghanistan,"" Ujaama wrote to the prominent preacher, asking for trainers in both the physical and spiritual aspects of holy war to be sent from London so fighters could be readied for the Afghanistan front lines. Ujaama testified that his note promised scores of eager recruits who'd already pledged their loyalty to the preacher, along with a hillside hiding place and personal security detail when he arrived at the camp. They were amassing stockpiles of weapons, and building living facilities and even a mosque, wrote Ujaama. These were lies, he testified; there were no recruits or weapons, and the ranch's only living structures were two run-down trailers. ""If he accepted it, I'd know I had a buy-in and I'd start building."" Al-Masri's presence was crucial to getting the cash flow started, Ujaama testified: ""He'd be the star attraction."" Two men were allegedly sent by al-Masri to aid with the effort, carrying cash and training materials, but left once they realized Ujaama's promises were empty, according to testimony. Ujaama later worked for al-Masri at his London mosque and ran the website of Supporters of Sharia, an organization the defendant headed, he testified. In 2000, the defendant ordered him to deliver a young man, Feroz Abbasi, to a front line commander in Afghanistan, he testified, along with envelopes of cash to a girls' school and widows of holy warriors. He instead abandoned Abbasi in a Pakistani guesthouse. Ujaama admitted on the stand that his past is marred by a range of criminal endeavors, including selling stolen laptops and knock-off watches he picked up in New York City and passed off as expensive brand originals. He spent approximately six years in prison for his role in the defendant's alleged endeavors and testified as part of a deal with the government that allowed for a significant reduction in jail time. Another witness, Saajid Badat, testified to later seeing Abbasi at an Afghan training camp and gave jurors a glimpse into the world of recruits there; a world where bin Laden himself handed out awards for target shooting, and classmates included future 9/11 hijackers. Badat, who reached a deal for leniency with British prosecutors in exchange for his testimony, took the stand via closed circuit television from London because of his steadfast refusal to risk traveling to the United States, where he faces additional charges. The charges against Badat both in the United Kingdom and the United States center on his plan to join Richard Reid in a suicide mission to take down commercial airliners with shoe bombs. Badat testified he backed out of the mission after reconnecting with his family. The prosecution also called terrorism expert Evan F. Kohlmann to introduce jurors to the key figures of al Qaeda and the Taliban regime, and to testify about the crucial role non-al Qaeda members like al-Masri play for the organization, providing financial support and spreading its message. Al-Masri cuts an unusual figure in the courtroom; missing one eye and both hands, he wears an occasional writing prosthesis on his right forearm rather than the infamous hook-like device he's often seen sporting in photographs. Opting for comfort, he asked his attorneys for sweat pants and T-shirts for the proceedings, rather than a suit. He could face life in prison if convicted.","Cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri tells court he went to London for ""American style"" fun .

"London (CNN) -- Work on the world's largest solar bridge has started in central London. The new solar roof spanning Blackfriars Railway Bridge above the River Thames will cover more than 6,000 square meters when finished, according to developers. Over 4,400 individual photovoltaic panels are expected to produce around 900,000 kilowatt hours of electricity every year, providing the station with half of its energy needs, according to Solar Century, the UK company installing the solar roof. Annual CO2 emissions are also expected to be reduced by more than 500 tons. ""It's fantastic to see this project finally come to fruition. Blackfriars Bridge is an ideal location for solar,"" Derry Newman, chief executive of Solar Century, said in a statement. ""For people to see that solar power is working is a vital step towards a clean energy future,"" he added. Built in 1886, the railway bridge is being transformed as part of an upgrade by Network Rail -- the owner and operator of rail infrastructure in the UK -- to the existing Blackfriars station. ""The Victorian rail bridge at Blackfriars is part of our railway history. Constructed in the age of steam, we're bringing it bang up to date with 21st century solar technology to create an iconic station for the city,"" Lindsay Vamplew, Network Rail's project director for Blackfriars said in a statement. In addition to the solar panels (manufactured by the SANYO Electric Co. Ltd), the station will also include rain-harvesting systems and sun pipes for natural lighting. The solar roof and the new station are due to be completed by the summer of 2012.","New solar array will be largest on a bridge anywhere in the world, say developers .

"(CNN) -- Young and old, they have braved the freezing cold for weeks to voice their discontent. Using snow, wood, metal and tires, thousands of protesters have barricaded themselves into a makeshift tent city, paralyzing central Kiev and refusing to leave until their demands are met. Undeterred by the Ukrainian winter chill, the demonstrators chant day and night, sometimes to the drumbeat of sticks on corrugated iron, and take to the stage to give speeches, demanding the government's ouster and new elections. For the past few weeks, billowing smoke, large fires, burnt out tires and cars as well as smashed windows of public buildings have become familiar scenes in the snowy city as protests have plunged Ukraine, an eastern European country of 45 million people, into a deep political crisis. Some of the images beamed around the world have been particularly dramatic -- protesters knocking down a giant statue of the Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin and hacking it with hammers to loud cheers, explosions reminiscent of a war zone echoing around downtown Kiev, fierce clashes and abuse. One protester, naked aside from his shoes, was seen being kicked and forced onto a police bus. The battlefield is central Kiev, the power base of an opposition which is demanding change in the former Soviet Union state. The lines have been drawn. Batons have been raised on both sides -- between the protesters armed with petrol bombs and stones and shielded riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets -- sometimes resulting in deadly clashes. But despite a crackdown, demonstrators' morale is high with no sign of their labyrinth of tents, railings and metal barrels that have taken up Kiev's central arteries being dismantled just yet. It has been two months since the first rattled demonstrators took to the streets, underscoring tensions in a country split between Europe and Russia. But Ukraine's political unrest seems to be worsening by the day -- drawing concern from its neighbors, Western European states and Washington. Here are some key questions about Ukraine's political unrest. Ukraine through a protester's eyes . What sparked the protests? The protests began in November as a pro-Europe gesture, underscoring the tensions in a country split between pro-European regions in the West and a more Russia-oriented East. Thousands spilled onto the streets after President Viktor Yanukovych did a U-turn over a trade pact with the European Union that had been years in the making -- favoring closer relations with Russia instead. Angered by this backpedaling, the demonstrators demanded the EU deal be signed, saying it would strengthen cooperation with the bloc. Their daily protests soon escalated, drawing parallels to Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution, which toppled the government. But with Ukraine desperately in need of a cash injection, Kiev cited the need for financial assistance if it were to do business with the EU. Yanukovych, in power since 2010, said Ukraine could not afford to sign the deal, alluding to economic pressure from Russia. Another factor in Yanukovych's decision not to sign the deal is likely to have been the EU's demands that he free from jail former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his political opponent. The Orange Revolution that swept him from office in 2004, when he was prime minister, also swept Tymoshenko to power. Soon afterward, he flew to Moscow where he and President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas. While unhappy with that, what inflamed the demonstrators even more, however, was the adoption of a sweeping anti-protest law by the parliament on January 16. The new law included provisions barring people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies and from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission. This sparked concerns it could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech -- and clashes soon escalated. Last week, several people were killed and hundreds of others injured in heavy street fighting. The epicenter of the protests has been Kiev's central Independence Square, Maidan, but the demonstrators have also blocked other streets and government buildings. On Sunday, they briefly seized the justice ministry. ""The changes that occurred after the Orange Revolution weren't simply deep enough. This time around, it appears that the disenchantment is so strong that there is a genuine opportunity to make a fresh start,"" said Dalibor Rohac, policy analyst with the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity. ""For Ukrainians this is a chance to get on a different trajectory from the one the country has been on for the past 22 years and become eventually a part of prosperous, democratic Europe."" Read more: Ukraine protests - 5 things you need to know . What's being done to try to reach an end to the fighting? The leaders of three opposition factions have met several times with Yanukovych and a government working group to try to resolve the crisis. They are former boxer Vitali Klitschko, leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party; Arseniy Yatsenyuk, of the Fatherland party; and Oleh Tiahnybok, of the Freedom party, or Svoboda. The president's foes have mainly been calling for the government to be dissolved, new elections to be held and for the protest laws to be absolved. On Saturday, Yanukovych offered a package of concessions under which Yatsenyuk would have become the prime minister and, under the president's offer, been able to dismiss the government. He also offered Klitschko, a champion boxer known as ""Dr. Ironfist,"" the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues and also agreed to a working group looking at changes to the constitution. But the opposition refused. ""No deal @ua_yanukovych, we're finishing what we started. The people decide our leaders, not you,"" Yatsenyuk tweeted. A special parliamentary session also looked at legislation that might provide amnesty for more than 200 people arrested since the demonstrations began in late November. It was adjourned until Wednesday, when lawmakers will continue the debate. How does the situation affect the rest of the region? Ukraine is the biggest frontier nation separating Russia and the EU. Once part of the Soviet Union, the country gained its modern Independence in 1991 following the fall of the Berlin Wall. The West -- the EU, together with the United States -- has been working on its relations with former Soviet bloc countries for more than two decades, with the aim of restoring democratic rule and improving quality of life for Ukrainians. It views the decision by Ukraine, the largest of the former republics, not to partner up with the EU as bowing to Russian pressure. Ukraine is something of a pawn between Russia and the West. For the West, the deal would mean its reach would spread further east; by contrast, the Russians see the Ukraine as key to holding on to their turf. Putin has denied that Moscow is exerting undue influence in Ukraine. At a long-planned ""Russia summit"" in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday, where Ukraine was high on the agenda, he said: ""Russia has always respected, is respecting and will respect the sovereign rights of all the international entities including new states that emerged after breakdown of the Soviet Union."" Putin also said Russia would stick to the loan and energy commitments to Ukraine -- agreed in December -- even if the opposition comes to power. European Council President Herman van Rompuy told reporters the bloc was ready to move ahead with the planned trade deal, or association agreement that has been at the heart of the crisis, but also urged restraint and said those responsible for violence in Ukraine must be held accountable. Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, is due in Kiev on Tuesday. Ukraine has made an effort to move toward Western ideals when it comes to politics and human rights, but the nation is still ranked 144 out of 177 countries in Transparency International's corruption index. The Ukrainians who have taken to the streets say they want to see a better governed, less corrupt and politically liberal country, more closely aligned with its western neighbors. Ukraine's economy has been slow to follow its western neighbors that were also under Soviet control -- Poland, for example, where the economy has grown exponentially. Many Ukrainians hope that an EU deal would offer the chance of economic recovery. How does this affect the United States? The United States has been among the Western governments calling for an end to the violence and a solution through political dialogue -- but some say it has not been the most vocal. Washington has released several statements voicing concern about the crisis, and top officials have spoken on the phone to Kiev. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Yanukovych on Monday night to reiterate American support for ""a peaceful, political solution to the crisis,"" the White House said. In December, U.S. Sen. John McCain, who has been critical of Ukrainian authorities' use of force against demonstrators, and Sen. Christopher Murphy traveled to Kiev and met with the protesters. ""The U.S. seems to be treading carefully to avoid getting crosswise with Russia at a moment when Moscow's support is critical for what the U.S. is trying to do on Syria and Iran,"" said Jeffrey Mankoff, deputy director and fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Russia and Eurasia Program. ""It's wise for the U.S. to avoid making Ukraine into a bellwether for relations with Russia, and for encouraging both sides in Kiev to seek a negotiated settlement, but some of the Europeans are already unhappy at what they see as a lack of U.S. leadership ion this issue.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A faulty pipe, flawed operations, and inadequate government oversight led to the 2010 Northern California natural gas explosion that killed eight people, federal officials said Tuesday. During a public board meeting, National Transportation Safety Board investigators delivered their final report on the matter, sharply criticizing pipeline owner Pacific Gas and Electric for the explosion in San Bruno, saying the pipe was inadequate from the time it was installed in 1956. That was compounded ""by a litany of failures"" over several years, including poor record-keeping, inadequate inspection programs, and ""an integrity management program without integrity,"" NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said. ""It was not a question of if this pipeline would burst,"" she said. ""It was a question of when."" Hersman said the probe yielded ""troubling revelations about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight, and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety."" The September 9, 2010, explosion created a 72-foot long, 26-foot-wide crater, destroyed 38 homes and left eight dead in San Bruno, near San Francisco International Airport. A 28-foot segment of the pipe was found about 100 feet away from the crater. Scorched homes and the shells of burned-out cars lined charred streets where firefighters battled hot spots trying to save the devastated neighborhood. PG&E did not respond to CNN's requests for comment about the report, but in advance of the hearing, the company released a statement saying it had taken ""multiple steps"" to improve the safety of its natural gas operations, including efforts to replace aging pipe and improve contacts with local police and fire departments. In a statement posted on its website, the company said, ""The NTSB's continued work to determine the cause of this tragic accident is critical in helping PG&E and the industry understand what steps need to be taken to avoid a future accident like the one in San Bruno. As before, we will update our improvement plans based on these latest findings without delay."" NTSB investigators determined the explosion was caused by a substandard and poorly welded pipe, creating a weak spot that grew to a critical size, causing the pipeline to rupture during a pressure increase stemming from poorly planned electrical work. They said the faulty welds should have been detected when the pipe was originally laid in the ground in 1956. Compounding the problem, investigators said, was the fact that PG&E failed to alert emergency responders as soon as they realized the line had burst. Isolating the rupture to stop the flow of gas took over an hour, and put first responders in a defensive mode as they struggled to put out the fire, investigators said. ""There was a lot of denial in the operating room that maybe it's a plane, maybe it's a gas station,"" said Ravi Chhatre, the NTSB's investigator-in-charge. At a mid-day news conference Tuesday, Hersman said the problem ""could have been detected if they (PG&E) had hydrostatically tested the line, if they had done in-line inspections."" ""There were a lot of opportunities missed here by PG&E,"" Hersman said. During the board meeting, board member Robert Sumwalt noted that the California Public Utilities Commission failed to exercise adequate oversight and enforcement of PG&E, and that the federal regulator, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which is a part of the Department of Transportation, failed to monitor the state commission's oversight of PG&E. ""This accident is not just about the failure of a seam in a pipeline. Rather it's about a failure of an entire system -- a system of checks and balances that should have been put in place to prevent the disaster,"" Sumwalt said. Board members pointed to past PG&E-related incidents as examples of the company's lax procedures, noting a gas explosion resulting in a fatality in 2008, and a gas main break in 1981 that forced more than 30,000 people to evacuate San Francisco's financial district. The NTSB closed the hearing with 26 recommendations, including requiring natural gas pipeline operators to equip their systems with real-time recognition tools to pinpoint leaks and line breaks, and automatic shut-off and remote control valves in ""high-consequence areas."" Speaking to members of the press after the hearing, Hersman said the recommendations ""are strongly worded and far-reaching."" She said the board's recommendations in the past have not been taken seriously. ""We've heard a lot of promises, but now what we're asking is ... that regulators are tough,"" she said. ""The regulators are the only ones that are standing between the operators and the public, and the public is counting on them to make sure the operators are doing the right thing."" San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera, who has filed an intent to sue the California Public Utilities Commission and federal regulators ""for their failure to reasonably enforce safety standards,"" said in a statement issued after the NTSB's meeting that the investigators' findings support his move. PG&E runs three major gas pipelines, including the one involved in the San Bruno explosion, under ""nine high-population-density neighborhoods in San Francisco,"" Herrera said.

"(CNN) -- The new cease-fire implemented in embattled eastern Ukraine by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Friday was clearly under threat by Saturday, if not sooner. Three Ukrainian border guards were wounded when pro-Russian separatists launched a mortar attack and opened fire with automatic weapons near the town of Vyselky, in the Donetsk region, Ukraine's State Border Service said in a statement Saturday. The wounded guards were evacuated as security forces were notified, according to the Border Service. The separatists also targeted a nearby checkpoint in Uspenka, using small arms, but the attack was repelled by guards, the Border Service said. Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since March, when Russia annexed Crimea and massed troops along its border with Ukraine. Ukraine's government in Kiev has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russia separatists, who have led uprisings in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Meanwhile, three military tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers of unknown origin were seen in Luhansk, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which operates a special monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine, said Saturday. The military convoy drove through the city early Friday morning, according to local witnesses and traffic surveillance camera footage seen by the mission. The convoy came from the direction of the Russian border, going east and was observed in Alchevsk, 27 miles southwest of Luhansk, heading toward Donetsk, OSCE said. Meanwhile, four OSCE monitors from the Donetsk team have been missing for 26 days and four other monitors from the Luhansk team for 23 days, the group said. Kremlin responds to cease-fire plan . Also Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed support for Poroshenko's cease-fire plan, the Kremlin said in a statement. Putin emphasized that the plan ""should not take the character of an ultimatum to militants"" and that the cease-fire ""should be used to begin constructive negotiations and political compromises between the opponent parties in eastern Ukraine,"" according to the Kremlin. But the statement also mentioned an incident Friday on the Ukrainian-Russian border after the cease-fire was first declared. The Russian Foreign Ministry said one of its units in Novoshakhtinsk, near the border with Ukraine, was shelled, injuring one customs officer. Ukraine denied that it fired artillery or mortar at the Russian unit. Putin said in the statement released Saturday that he considers the incident ""unacceptable,"" especially because it happened after Poroshenko declared a cease-fire. Poroshenko declares cease-fire . Poroshenko declared a cease-fire Friday in Kiev's fight against separatists in the country's pro-Russian east. He said military units would respond only if they're attacked and he warned militant fighters to abandon their weapons before the cease-fire expires on June 27. ""Those who will not lay down their weapons will be destroyed,"" Poroshenko said, according to a statement issued by the Interior Ministry. Poroshenko announced plans for the cease-fire on Wednesday. He spoke with Putin by phone on Thursday, according to Poroshenko's office. Putin has said he backs an effort to de-escalate tensions in eastern regions and supports a process to forge a cease-fire and a peace plan. President: Free hostages . Poroshenko's cease-fire includes the closure of the Ukraine-Russia border and changes to the constitution to decentralize power. It also offers amnesty to those who didn't commit serious crimes, the President said. An escape corridor will be offered for those who disarm to leave Ukraine. ""We expect that hostages and seized premises will be liberated. We expect that a large number of civilians will use the security guarantees for the citizens of Donbas,"" Poroshenko said, referring to Ukraine's eastern region. In his conversation with Putin, Poroshenko stressed the need for the release of Ukrainian hostages and to establish effective security controls on the border with Russia.

"London, England (CNN) -- A solar-powered aircraft, which a team hopes will one day circle the globe, completed a 26-hour test flight in Switzerland at 9 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) Thursday. Solar Impulse took off shortly before 7 a.m. Wednesday from an airfield in Payerne, 80 miles northeast of Geneva. The plane was piloted by Andre Borschberg, who flew to a height of nearly 28,000 feet (8,500 meters). ""I've been a pilot for 40 years now, but this flight has been the most incredible one of my flying career,"" Borschberg said, according to the New York Times. ""Just sitting there and watching the battery charge level rise and rise thanks to the sun. I have just flown more than 26 hours without using a drop of fuel and without causing any pollution."" During the evening, the plane slowly descended to an altitude of 4,500 feet (1,500 meters), where it remained for the rest of the night using battery power. An hour before dawn, the plane still had six hours of flying time left in its solar-fueled batteries. Solar Impulse has a wingspan of more than 206 feet (63 meters) -- the same as an Airbus A340 -- and is nearly 72 feet (22 meters) long. It weighs about 3,500 pounds (1,600 kilograms) and has nearly 12,000 solar cells attached to its wings and horizontal stabilizers. The plane is equipped with four electric engines and has a top speed of about 43 miles (70 kilometers) per hour. ""The goal of the project is to have a solar-powered plane flying day and night without fuel,"" said the co-founder of the project, Bertrand Piccard. The Swiss adventurer, who piloted the first nonstop balloon flight around the world in 1999 in the Breitling Orbiter III, said the test flight was ""crucial for the credibility of the project."" The challenge to fly a solar plane around the world was announced in 2003. With the success of the test flight, a second airplane will be designed to fly much farther next year, with the aim of flying across continents and the Atlantic Ocean. In 2012, the team hopes to fly Solar Impulse around the world in five stages.","Solar plane completes a 26-hour test flight in Switzerland .

"(CNN) -- U.S. drug agents in Thailand took custody of five men wanted in the United States on allegations of being part of a drug ring that sought to traffic in North Korean methamphetamine and other drugs, CNN has learned. The men, who have British, Filipino, Taiwanese and Slovak citizenship, were being flown to New York to face charges, according to a source. Thai authorities announced the arrests after the men were turned over to U.S. authorities. A U.S. law enforcement official said the charges would be made public soon. The men are part of a broader investigation that federal prosecutors made public in September, filing charges against a group of former U.S. and European ex-military men in a murder-for-hire and drug-importation plot. The Drug Enforcement Administration concocted a sting operation and arrested Joseph Hunter, a former U.S. Army sniper trainer nicknamed Rambo, and four others in the sting case. The five more recently arrested were expelled by Thai authorities and put on a DEA plane to New York. Additional details of the charges couldn't be learned because they remain under seal. Drug trafficking from North Korea has occurred for decades with at least 50 documented incidents. In previous years, North Korea had been linked to shipments of heroin and methamphetamine, according to the CIA World Factbook. In 2003, a North Korean ship, Pong Su which was carrying nearly 300 pounds of heroin, was seized along the eastern coast of Australia after a four-day chase. There isn't enough information to determine whether the North Korean government is currently involved in drug trafficking, according to the 2013 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report issued by the U.S. State Department . ""There have been no confirmed reports of large-scale drug trafficking involving DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) state entities since 2004,"" it stated. ""This suggests that state-sponsored drug trafficking may have ceased or been sharply reduced, or that the DPRK regime has become more adept at concealing state-sponsored trafficking of illicit drugs."" The report also highlighted that the ""proximity and availability of precursor chemicals in China likely contribute to the production of methamphetamine within North Korea."" It alluded to reported transactions between North Korean traffickers and organized crime groups. Corrupt security agents and government officials are likely responsible for transnational drug operations, according to a different report published in North Korean Review in 2010. There is great difficulty in collecting data or accurate information regarding drug trafficking because of the secrecy in North Korea. So the report's authors, Minwoo Yun and Eunyoung Kim relied on interviews with 28 North Korean defectors living in China and Thailand as well as various documents. They could not be reached Wednesday for this story. Their report alleges that in the 1980s, the North Korean state ""deliberately chose various transnational crime businesses including drug trafficking"" during economically troubled times. The North Koreans specialized in heroin trade and kept the drug away from the ordinary population. Once the economy veered into famine and economic disaster in the 1990s, individuals desperate to survive turned to private drug enterprise, according to Yun and Kim's report. Corrupt agents and officials sold drugs to transnational organized crime operations through the North Korea-China border, they wrote. Family members also became private drug traffickers, they added. After poppy production failed due to weather, methamphetamine became more popular, according to a 2007 Drug Trafficking and North Korea report prepared for the U.S. Congress. One of the interviewees in Yun and Kim's report said that the city of Hamhueng is the center of methamphetamine production, because it produces the country's chemicals. Internally, North Koreans started using opium instead of hard-to-obtain and pricey medication, according to the report. And recreational drug users are more likely wealthy businessmen or members of the Party, according to South Korean media. More recently, methamphetamine is more widely used in North Korea as stricter China border controls forced drug producers to seek a local market for ""ice,"" according to a report in the Spring 2013 edition of the journal North Korean Review.","5 men arrested in Thailand are being flown to the United States, CNN has learned .

"(CNN) -- It may be a case of wishful thinking, but a British tabloid is reporting that Kim Kardashian may be pursuing a music career again. According to The Sun, the newlywed has enlisted the help of husband Kanye West as well as vocal and songwriting coaches to help her break into the industry. Now, we say wishful thinking because embarking on such a venture would just give folks the opportunity to write even more about Kardashian (raising our hands over here, too). That's the whole point, isn't it? Still, it's not that she hasn't tried before. Remember the reality star's single, ""Jam (Turn It Up),"" from 2011? Most people probably don't. The song gained practically no traction. In 2012 Kardashian was quoted as saying that she would never try to launch a singing career. ""No, I'd never (make another single), that was just for fun, and for charity,"" she said at the time. Proceeds from her single, which failed to make the charts, reportedly went to fund St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.","A British tabloid is reporting the reality star is ready to try singing again .

"(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman in the prison where he is serving a 28-year sentence, his attorney told HLN, CNN's sister network, on Friday. Van der Sloot, who remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of American Natalee Holloway, and his unnamed fiancÃ©e are working on completing the paperwork required for the wedding, said attorney Maximo Altez. The couple hopes to be able to marry within the next two weeks, Altez said. They reportedly met while she was visiting another inmate at Miguel Castro Castro prison in San Juan de Lurigancho. Joran van der Sloot challenges extradition to U.S. Van der Sloot, 25, pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephany Flores, whose body was found in May 2010 in a Lima hotel room registered in the Dutchman's name. He also has been indicted in the United States on charges related to the disappearance of Holloway. Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament.","Joran van der Sloot plans to marry in Peruvian prison .

"(CNN) -- Former President Bill Clinton acknowledges he got ""very close"" to helping achieve peace in the Middle East shortly before ending his eight years in office. Over a two-week period in 2000, Clinton played host at Camp David to then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat. The summit ultimately ended without agreement. Two U.S. presidents later, the conflict rages on. Now, Clinton is less optimistic Middle East negotiators will get that close again, telling CNN's Anna Coren that peace between Israel and the Palestinians is impossible until Hamas renounces violence. ""There is no way the Israelis are going to give up the West Bank and agree to a state unless Hamas agrees to give up violence and recognizes Israel's right to exist,"" he said in the interview airing Monday on ""New Day."" ""They won't do it so that's a non-starter and I think it should be. You can't just have a one-way peace. Both sides have got to give up what the other side most objects to."" There's still hope for peace in the Middle East . Israeli-Palestinian relations are at a low point. Israeli military forces began a ground offensive into Gaza on Thursday, inflicting heavy casualties. More than 400 Palestinians have been killed since the latest outbreak of violence. At least 13 Israeli soldiers were killed in fighting in Gaza on Sunday, the Israeli military said. Nevertheless, Clinton said he's not giving up hope for peace in the region. ""We dance around the bush so many times and sooner or later someone will jump off the merry go round and do the right thing,"" he said. ""We got very close in 2000."" Clinton was interviewed by Coren during stops on the former President's eight-day tour of Southeast Asia, which included a visit to an AIDS orphanage in Vietnam ahead of the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne. The conference opened Sunday on a somber note -- at least six delegates traveling to the event were killed Thursday when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 exploded over eastern Ukraine. Clinton is scheduled to give a keynote address at the conference on Wednesday. ""They're really, in a way, martyrs to the cause we are going to Australia to talk about,"" Clinton said of the researchers who died when unknown attackers shot their plane down over a rebel-controlled area of eastern Ukraine. ""Thinking about those people being knocked out of the sky, it's pretty tough."" On the crash of the Boeing 777 itself, Clinton was careful not to draw immediate conclusions on who was responsible for the downing of the jet, which he called ""sickening."" ""We need to wait to make any definitive statements until we know exactly what happened, but it was sickening and I hope they will know and I hope they will know soon,"" he said. Since leaving office, Clinton started the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative (now called the Clinton Health Access Initiative) in an effort to get treatment to HIV/AIDS patients in the developing world. The initiative has brought access to HIV/AIDS treatment to 8.2 million people since it was founded in 2002, according to the Clinton Foundation. ""I like it because it's personal flesh and blood,"" he says of his second career in public service through his foundation. ""You're not just talking in abstract policy terms. You actually see the lives of people change. ... I loved my life in politics. I loved it. But the difference now is I can see the personal human implications of the decisions we are making and I can work on, you know, how do we get the right policy? How do we make it work? And then you see the results."" Clinton touched on a number of other issues in the wide-ranging interview, among them: . Aid for migrant children a good step . President Barack Obama's pitch to Congress for billions of dollars to handle the cases of tens of thousands of children from Central America who are illegally crossing the border is a step in the right direction, Clinton said. ""I hope that he will get this money he has asked for, because some of these kids may be eligible to stay under our laws because of the circumstances they face back home,"" Clinton said. ""And we don't want to deny the ones who are eligible the right to stay even as we send the other ones back."" Since October, officials say more than 57,500 unaccompanied minors have been apprehended at the southwest U.S. border. The Obama administration has labeled the situation a humanitarian crisis, and has asked for emergency funding to deal with it. ""The system he has proposed to put in place, if he gets the money for it, will give all the ones who aren't immediately sent back ... quicker hearings, so if they are entitled to stay, they can stay,"" Clinton said. Ukraine wants independence, not war with Russia . ""The Ukrainians don't really want a hostile relationship with Russia. ... What they want is to be independent,"" Clinton said of the political conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Tensions have been high between Ukraine and Russia since street protests forced former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion has been raging in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Ukraine wants ""to be a bridge to Europe, between Europe and Russia. And if done properly it would be good for Ukraine but also be very good for Russia and good for Europe. So we have a clash there about what the 21st Century ought to be like. Is it important for all of us to divide up and hide behind our walls? Or can we find a way to work together?"" U.S. should help Iraq, which needs to help itself . ""I wouldn't rule out the United States doing more in Iraq if the Iraqis do what's necessary to help themselves,"" Clinton said of the worsening humanitarian situation in the country. The violent militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has taken over large swaths of land in Iraq and aims to establish a hardline Islamic state. At least 2,400 Iraqis died in violence in June, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. Of those, the United Nations said more than 1,500 were civilians. ""We have got to be helping an entity committed to inclusive government for the next 20 or 30 years -- people who don't want the forces of destruction to prevail are going to have to prove they can do inclusive government and inclusive economics,"" Clinton said. Settle China's territorial claims internationally . China's territorial claims over nearby bodies of water have caused tensions to escalate with neighboring countries. Conflict between Vietnam and China flared in May when a Chinese oil corporation moved a drilling rig to an area claimed by both countries in the South China Sea. And last November, China declared an air defense identification zone over the East China Sea, imposing air traffic restrictions over an area disputed with Japan. China's moves have made other Asian countries nervous over its expanding military and more assertive foreign policy. And Clinton says the United States has a different take than China on how to solve the disputes. ""One of the big differences is the United States believes that we should have these issues involving natural resource claims in the south and east China seas resolved in a multinational forum where the small countries are not disadvantaged by being smaller than China,"" Clinton said. ""And the Chinese believe that all these things should be subject to what they call bilateral resolution, where the small countries believe they wouldn't have a chance trying to negotiate against China, just one country against the Chinese.""

"(CNN) -- Florida's decision this week to shun federal funding for high-speed rail has set off an auction house-like frenzy among some states hoping to get a bigger piece of the pie. Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he rejected the rail funds because the risks outweighed the benefits, citing the projected costs to state taxpayers and ""overly optimistic"" ridership and revenue projections. The plan ""would likely result in ongoing subsidies that state taxpayers would have to incur,"" he said in a statement Wednesday. ""I was elected to get Floridians back to work and to change the way government does business in our state,"" Scott said. With his rejection of the highly touted federal money, Scott joined two other Republican governors elected in November -- Wisconsin's Scott Walker and Ohio's John Kasich -- in turning down funds from the White House initiative for national high-speed rail. Florida was offered $2.4 billion to link Tampa and Orlando by rail. Florida officials had hoped the tracks would be the first of a three-part system that would connect the tourist destinations of Orlando, Tampa and Miami. The rail funds are part of the Obama administration's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail project, which the White House hopes will make high-speed rail accessible to 80% of Americans by 2035. The administration recently proposed $53 billion in additional spending on the national high-speed rail project. The plan represents a significant expansion of the $10.5 billion already allocated for high speed rail, including $8 billion in the 2009 economic stimulus package. Republicans have targeted billions of dollars in cuts from the current year's budget, with high-speed rail one of the targets. Given the momentum the White House hoped to gain from the states' cooperation, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said he was ""extremely disappointed"" in Scott's refusal to take the funds. Immediately after Scott's decision, state jockeying to take Florida's share of rail funding began in full force -- including immediate overtures from Illinois, California and New York. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, wrote LaHood acknowledging the more than $1.4 billion sent to Obama's home state. ""But more can be done,"" Durbin said. ""Illinois is ready and willing to put rail dollars to work if other states are not. In fact, the funding dedicated to Florida can accelerate completing other segments of the Chicago Hub high-speed network,"" Durbin said. Democratic New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand also wrote to LaHood, imploring him to redirect the funds to New York. ""These investments will create jobs, spur economic development and continue to build on the growth of ridership we've seen in recent years,"" she said. ""You are keenly aware of the benefits that high-speed rail development would bring New York and the United States, which is why I respectfully request that these dismissed funds be re-appropriated to New York and the Northeast Corridor."" The stakes are high: In December, LaHood announced that 14 states would divvy up the $1.4 billion that Wisconsin and Ohio spurned, with California getting the lion's share. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, wrote to the Obama administration at the time: ""You are more than welcome to redirect that money to California."" This week, a California lawmaker acknowledged another potential windfall to the state. ""It's a cloudy day in the Sunshine State,"" Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of Walnut Grove said Wednesday. ""But Florida's deep loss is likely to be California's tremendous gain. We're prepared to show the rest of the country what a modern transportation network looks like and will gladly invest every penny the federal government is willing to provide,"" he said. On Friday, Maryland threw its hat in the ring. ""Maryland and the NEC (Northeast Corridor) would benefit greatly from receipt of the federal high-speed rail funds recently rejected by the governor of Florida,"" Democratic Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said in a statement addressed to LaHood. In Florida, criticism of the governor's move came from both sides of the political aisle. Some Republican lawmakers wondered if the governor's actions could be sidestepped. ""I don't know constitutionally speaking whether or not this can be rejected by the governor without the consent of the Legislature,"" Republican State Sen. David Simmons told the Orlando Sentinel. Also, Florida Republican U.S. Rep. John Mica, chairman of the House Transportation Infrastructure Committee, and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said they would try to bypass the governor's decision. Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor said Floridians could have used the appropriation to create jobs. The funds were originally sought by then-Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned independent. ""Gov. Scott's decision demonstrates a devastating lack of vision for Florida and a lack of understanding of our economic situation,"" Castor said. ""The governor put his own rigid ideology ahead of the best interests of Florida's businesses, workers and families. High-speed rail is projected to create thousands and thousands of jobs in our state."" The Obama administration has given Florida until February 25 to accept the transit funds, according to CNN affiliate WKMG in Orlando. Nelson said state officials were researching a plan to have a private metropolitan organization take oversight of the rail project without the governor. ""Looks like we are going to have to find another entity that would be something other than the state in order to channel the funds through, along with participation of the private companies that are bidding to build and to operate the high-speed rail,"" Nelson said on his Youtube channel. ""We have the lawyers in the Department of Transportation that are now doing the research.""","Immediately after Florida Gov. Rick Scott's decision, state jockeying for rail money began .

"New York (CNN) -- A dark chapter in recent New York City history stands to close with a proposal for the city to pay a $40 million civil rights settlement to five black and Hispanic men wrongfully convicted in the horrific beating and rape of a white female jogger in Central Park in 1989, a source with knowledge of the settlement told CNN on Friday. The sensational case polarized the city along racial lines and became emblematic of a state of rampant crime. Five minority teenagers, who became known as the Central Park Five, were coerced amid public uproar into making incriminating statements and convicted in 1990. The proposed agreement between the city law department and the five men -- who served between seven and 13 years in prison -- averages about $1 million per year of incarceration, according to the source. One of the men, Kharey Wise, served 13 years in prison. Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Raymond Santana Jr. each served about seven years. The proposed settlement still has to be approved by the city comptroller and then submitted for approval to Judge Deborah Batts of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where the men filed their civil rights lawsuit. The source said a formal announcement on the settlement would be made next week. The agreement was first reported in The New York Times. In a statement Friday, the city comptroller's office said it had received the agreement. ""As with all proposed settlements, under our Charter-mandated authority, we will do our due diligence and provide feedback to ensure that any settlement we approve is in the best interests of the City,"" the statement said. In 2012, filmmaker Ken Burns, along with daughter Sarah Burns and her husband, David McMahon, produced an award-winning documentary about the infamous case. ""We are thrilled to hear about the potential settlement with the Central Park Five,"" the three said in statement Friday. ""It will finally give some closure and bring a measure of justice in this tragic case. The five men were just teenagers when they were wrongly convicted. ... Their story has come to symbolize the immense challenges we continue to confront when it comes to race in this country, but it is also the story of five men maintaining their dignity in the face of injustice and now, of the collective power to acknowledge and correct our mistakes."" Sarah Burns told CNN that it was time for the story of the Central Park Five ""to be over."" ""Having gotten to know them well ... the closure and finishing this meant a lot,"" she said. ""I never heard them talk about money, but I heard them talk about closure and being able to move on, and feeling some sense that a settlement would be an acknowledgment to their exoneration, and that meant a lot to them even though it's not like they're ever gonna get an apology for the people responsible. But this is the closest they'll get, and that does mean a lot."" On April 19, 1989, a 28-year-old Wall Street investment banker jogging through Central Park was raped, viciously beaten and left for dead. She would have no memory of the attack. That same night, a group of black and Latino boys had been in the park, throwing rocks at cars and assaulting people in a practice the media and law enforcement at the time called ""wilding."" An investigation led to the arrest of five teens who were accused of rampaging through the park in a ""wolf pack"" and preying on innocent victims. They were charged and convicted. ""If they had their way,"" Salaam told CNN in 2012, ""we would have been hanging from one of those lovely trees here in Central Park."" The victim, Trisha Meili, kept her identity hidden for 14 years until the publication of her book, ""I Am the Central Park Jogger."" ""I guess there are lots of theories out there but I just don't know and it's almost too confusing for me to understand,"" she told CNN in 2003, referring to the false confessions given by the five men. ""I've had to come to peace with it by saying: 'You know what? I'm just not going to know.'"" Three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms, one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer in 2001 confessed to the crime and said he had acted alone. ""After being exonerated, it's like somebody running free through the...grass and throwing their hands up and yelling, 'ah!' you know...the feeling is overjoy and happiness,"" Salaam told CNN. DNA analysis later determined that Reyes did rape the jogger and that hair evidence used in the boys' trials did not match. Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney at the time, ordered a new investigation and, on his recommendation, a judge vacated the convictions. A civil rights lawsuit filed by the five men accused police and prosecutors of false arrest, malicious prosecution and a racially motivated conspiracy. The administration of former mayor Michael Bloomberg fought the case, but his successor, Bill de Blasio, pledged to settle the suit before taking office.","Wrongfully convicted men in New York City jogger rape case to settle suit, source says .

"(CNN) -- Neuroscientists love Aplysia. They are a type of sea slug that grows to be about a foot long. With only 20,000 nerve cells -- compared with about 100 billion found in the human brain -- Aplysia are the perfect lab animals for brain researchers hoping to isolate a crucial connection. Plus, ""they're just attractive to look at,"" says Dr. Eric Kandel, a biochemistry and biophysics professor at Columbia University. Kandel won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work with Aplysia -- or more specifically, for his work on the biological mechanisms of memory storage. For decades, Kandel has studied how we create short-term and long-term memories at the molecular level. His work has shown what genes are changed during the learning process, how these genes are altered and how the changes contribute to the growth of new connections in the brain. CNN spoke with Kandel about his research and why he's fascinated by the human brain. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . CNN: Why do you think the Nobel Prize committee recognized your work? Dr. Eric Kandel: There are two forms (of memory). One is complex forms of memory, which require the hippocampus and (are called) explicit memory storage. The very simple forms like driving a car -- once you know how to do it, you do it automatically -- we call that implicit memory storage. And the two involve different systems in the brain. Being a romantic, I started out with Alden Spencer to study the hippocampus. I'm thinking, 'That's the seat of complex memory, and I want to get complicated.' And we succeeded to record from the hippocampus. We were the first scientists to do this and we were euphoric. A medical miracle: Saving cholera victims . But after a while, we realized that studying the cells in a region involved in memory is necessary but not sufficient. You've got to see how a memory is formed. You've got to see how information comes into the hippocampus and how it is stored over the long term. And when we tried to see what comes into the hippocampus, we found it very complicated to analyze. So I realized we had to take a very different approach. Rather than studying the most complex form of memory in a very complicated animal, we had to take the most simple form -- an implicit form of memory -- in a very simple animal. So I began to look around for very simple animals. And I focused in on the marine snail Aplysia. My colleagues and I found that learning involves alterations in the strength of communication between nerve cells. Nerve cells communicate with one another at specialized points called synapses. And these synapses are plastic -- they can be modified by learning. If you produce a short-term memory -- if you look up a telephone number you just remember for a short period of time (or) you meet somebody and remember their name briefly -- you have a transient change in the strength of communication. But if you have a long-term memory, you alter the expression of genes in the brain and you grow new synaptic connections. So as I tell my friends, if you remember anything about this conversation, you will have a different brain than you started out with before the conversation. CNN: So would memory work the same in a human as it does in a snail? In other words, is what you've discovered applicable to us? Kandel: Yes and no. Obviously human memory is much more complicated than memory of a snail. We can learn things that they can't learn, obviously. We (have) conscious experiences as well as unconscious experiences. So the level of complexity is infinitely greater. But the remarkable thing that Darwin discovered is that evolution is very conservative. If it finds through natural selection that some set of mechanisms work, it tends to retain those mechanisms in perpetuity. And this is what one finds with the learning process. 10 women who changed medicine . CNN: What led you to neuroscience research? Kandel: I had no interest in science whatsoever. I went to medical school after having decided to do so somewhere between my junior and senior year at Harvard -- very late. I initially wanted to be an intellectual historian. And I didn't particularly enjoy the science courses; even in medical school, I enjoyed the clinical work much more than the basic science courses. But I found working in the lab is so completely different than reading a textbook about it. You know, you're planning strategies; you're working with your own hands. There's essential satisfaction in running experiments. I remember having dinner with my wife before we were married and telling her, 'You know, I can see doing this for the rest of my life, but it's ridiculous. You don't have any money and I don't have any money. We want to raise a family, and I've got to earn a living going into private practice.' And she goes, 'Money is of no significance.' She has never uttered those magic words again, I can assure you (laughs). But that, at the moment, was quite inspirational. CNN: Why has memory research held your attention for so long? Kandel: Well, I think it's a fascinating problem because it's so central to everything we do. I once had the privilege of going to a Willem de Kooning retrospective at MOMA (the Museum of Modern Art in New York). De Kooning already had Alzheimer's disease. With Alzheimer's disease, you lose explicit memory, complicated memory, so he would have difficulty recognizing people. But he would go into studio, and he'd be another person because for a gifted painter, painting is like an implicit skill. It's like driving a car -- after you learn it, you can do it automatically. And he did some beautiful paintings when he had fairly advanced Alzheimer's disease. Clive Wearing -- the choir conductor in England -- had a severe explicit memory deficit. He couldn't recognize people, places. But when he sat down at the piano, he could play almost as well as he ever did. If you ask him afterward, 'What's it like to play the piano?' He would say, 'What are you talking about? I haven't played the piano in 20 years.' It's amazing. The other reason memory is so important is there is a number of a diseases that affect memory storage, and we'd like to know how they work so we can try to remedy them. Mom's death inspires doctor's work . CNN: There's been a lot of talk lately about ""mapping"" the brain. Why is that important? Kandel: The brain is the most complex object in the universe. And it is so important that we understand it, not only to understand ourselves and who we are, but also to be able to overcome many of the miseries that affect the brain. It's not just schizophrenia and depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety syndromes and autism. It's Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease -- dreadful disorders that we want to be able to help people with. So this is a major challenge. To see the president of the United States announce this first, in his State of the Union address, and then more recently at the White House -- and I had the privilege of being there -- is very exciting. They introduced President Obama by saying, this is our scientist in chief, and Obama broadly took on that title. So I think it's wonderful. CNN: In 2004, you said that we could have effective memory drugs in two years. Why do you think that's proved to be a bit more difficult than expected? Kandel: We have a reasonably good understanding of the molecular underpinnings of age-related memory loss. With Alzheimer's disease, I think the understanding is surprisingly good. But if we're so smart, how come we're not rich? How come we don't have treatments for Alzheimer's disease? There are two possibilities -- one is that we're deceiving ourselves and our understanding is much less complete than we think it is. Or, and I think this is a real possibility, we are starting to treat people too late in the disorder. By the time they come to us with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, they've had the disease for 10 years. Now if, God forbid, somebody has breast cancer or colon cancer for 10 years and you sought treatment then, that's pretty darn late if they're (even) still alive at that particular point with this severe form of cancer. So the whole thrust in Alzheimer's disease -- or at least an important thrust -- is to try to get early diagnoses so we can treat people much earlier than we are now treating them. CNN: When you first began your research, did you think we'd get this far? Kandel: Well, you know, it's a relative thing. When I started, we knew, on the level that I now work, practically nothing. We knew the anatomy a bit, we knew a lot from clinical insights, but we had very little insight into the underlying mechanism. And we've made a lot of progress on that, not just in learning but in perception and motor coordination and development. But if you look at where we want to go, what we ultimately want to understand, and how large the task is, one has to be very modest. ... There's much, much more to be studied, and much, much more to be learned. Moreover, the clinical benefits that we've gained out of what we've learned so far have been modest. The best is yet to come.","Dr. Eric Kandel studies how we create short- and long-term memories .

"(CNN) -- The Florida Supreme Court ruled Friday that Gov. Rick Scott can reject $2.4 billion in federal money that would have funded a proposed high-speed rail system in the state. The governor had made clear that he would reject the money, but two state senators -- a Democrat and Republican -- took him to court over that decision. They argued that he would overstep his executive authority and violate Florida's constitution if he did not accept the money, but the state's high court disagreed. The court decision clears the way for Scott's administration to focus on projects other than high-speed rail, the governor's spokesman, Brian Burgess said. ""The governor is gratified that the court provided a clear and unanimous decision,"" Burgess said. ""He is now focused on moving forward with infrastructure projects that create long-term jobs and turn Florida's economy around."" Scott had consistently opposed plans for an 84-mile-long high-speed rail line that would link Tampa and Orlando. After meeting with Scott last week, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood had set Friday as the deadline for accepting the federal dollars to help pay for the project. Otherwise, the money would be redirected to other states. The loss of the Florida project is seen by some as a direct blow to President Barack Obama's vision for a national high-speed rail network. ""I know that states across America are enthusiastic about receiving additional support to help bring America's high-speed rail network to life and deliver all its economic benefits to their citizens,"" LaHood said after speaking with Scott on Friday. In 2009, the legislature created and funded the Florida Rail Enterprise to oversee the high-speed rail line. But in oral arguments before the court on Thursday, an attorney for the governor said no laws were violated. The governor had stuck to his guns in recent weeks when questioned about his reasons for derailing the project. ""Our taxpayers aren't going to take the risk of the cost overrun of building it,"" according to Scott, who said the tab for the project could total $3 billion. He had also expressed concerns about long-term operating costs. ""We already have a train that goes from Palm Beach to Miami,"" Scott said Sunday during in an interview with Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Only one-sixth the cost of operations is covered by the fares."" But leaders in several of Florida's cities say they've eliminated all risk to taxpayers. ""We have addressed all of the governor's concerns,"" said Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio. ""We have structured this so that if there were cost overruns the private sector would take care if it."" Iorio, along with the mayors of Orlando, Lakeland and Miami, signed an agreement that calls for local authorities to take over the project with the help of the private sector. They presented their plain to Scott Wednesday. ""If there are operational short falls -- private sector. This is a true public-private partnership,"" Iorio said. ""This is what governors all across the country want and we had structured this in such a way that there would not be risk to the Florida taxpayers."" Scott's office did not respond to CNN's request for a comment on the agreement. Scott has said that he believes there would be a greater long-term benefit to the state if the money were used for other infrastructure projects. ""I want the money for our ports,"" he said, noting the expansion project now underway at the Panama Canal and the growth of economies in Central and South America. ""Put that money into the Florida ports. That's where we want that money spent."" But LaHood said the funds were specifically allocated for high-speed rail and can't be switched to other projects. Proponents of high-speed rail said they believed that Florida was the ideal location for an inter-city system. The Tampa to Orlando project would be the first leg in a line that advocates hope to extend to Miami and eventually Jacksonville in the north of the state. ""Here we have the most viable high-speed rail project in the country,"" said Petra Todorovich with The Regional Plan Association, a transportation and public policy think tank in New York. ""It has over 90 percent federal funding to get started. It has a team of private investors who are interested in covering the remaining capital costs and assuming the risks on ridership."" In theory, local municipalities could continue with the project regardless of whether the governor supported it, but that's not considered likely. Iorio said they can't get it done without the expertise of the state's transportation department -- an agency the governor could order not to get involved. CNN Radio's Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this report.","Florida Supreme Court rules that Gov. Rick Scott can reject federal funding .

"Kabul (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Austria on Sunday for talks with five other world powers and Iran on Tehran's nuclear program. The participants will hold a final round of negotiations ahead of a July 20 deadline aimed at reaching a permanent deal on the future of Iran's nuclear program. ""Obviously, we have some very significant gaps still, so we need to see if we can make some progress,"" Kerry said in the Austrian capital, Vienna. ""I really look forward to a very substantive and important set of meetings and dialogues."" The nuclear talks will include the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the U.S., UK, France, China and Russia -- and Germany. ""It is vital to make certain that Iran is not going to develop a nuclear weapon, that their program is peaceful,"" Kerry said. Tehran insists its ambitions are peaceful, but the world powers fear it plans to build nuclear weapons. ""We don't see any benefit in Iran developing a nuclear weapon,"" Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told NBC's ""Meet The Press"" from Vienna. He said Iran has a number of advantages over its neighbors, including ""the fact that we have better technology,"" which Iran doesn't need to augment with nukes. ""I believe nuclear weapons reduces countries' influence in our region,"" he added. ""It doesn't help anybody."" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking on ""Fox News Sunday"" from Jerusalem, called Zarif's comments a ""joke"" and a ""sham."" He said Iran has invested billions into its nuclear program. ""For what? For creating medical isotopes for Iranian patients circling the earth? What are they developing ICBMs for if not for nuclear warheads?"" he asked. ""What are they developing these -- building these enormous underground nuclear facilities, if not for a nuclear weapon?"" Kerry is expected to meet with Zarif on Sunday night. Kerry seeks to mend U.S.-German relations . Kerry met Sunday in Vienna with his German counterpart, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The encounter came amid a row over fresh spying allegations against the United States. On Thursday, Germany's government asked America's top spy chief stationed in the country to leave. This followed the revelation that two Germans -- one working at a German intelligence agency, the other in the Ministry of Defense -- are suspected of spying for the United States. After Sunday's meeting, Kerry described the relationship between the two countries as ""a strategic one. We have enormous political cooperation, and we are great friends and we will continue to work together in the kind of spirit that we exhibited today."" Kerry did not address the spy flap in his public remarks after the meeting, saying instead the conversation focused on Iran and also included Afghanistan and Iraq. Kerry: Afghanistan election audit coming . Kerry's stop in Austria follows an unannounced visit to Afghanistan, where divisions are growing since the country's contested presidential runoff election. After his visit, he announced that an audit of the disputed presidential election results will begin within a day in Kabul, and the two candidates will accept its determination of who won. The inauguration of the new president, originally scheduled for August, will be postponed during the audit of votes cast for Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, Kerry said. Provisional results showed Ghani ahead with roughly 56% support to 43% for Abdullah. Both candidates have alleged vote fraud and manipulation during the runoff last month.","NEW: Israeli Prime Minister says Iran is obviously trying to build nuclear weapons .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- Tuesday's explosion at a soccer viewing center in northeastern Nigeria claimed the lives of several men and young boys watching the Brazil-Mexico World Cup match. There are conflicting reports of the number of people affected by the blast. An updated number is expected later on. A hospital source said Wednesday that 21 people were killed in the explosion and another 27 were injured. The source from Sani Abacha Specialist Hospital in Damaturu spoke on the condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""All the victims are young men and boys. They sustained burns, ruptured tissues, shattered bones,"" he said. A police official placed the death toll lower Wednesday, saying 10 people had died. The hospital spokesman said its count was based on the number of bodies delivered to the facility's morgue. The incident occurred on the outskirts of Damaturu, in Yobe state, the sources said. The explosives had been concealed in an abandoned motorized rickshaw outside the center. ""Our men have deployed to the scene, but it's too early for us to give details, said Yobe state police Commissioner Sanusi Ruf'ai. Volatile northeastern Nigeria is the home of the Boko Haram group, the militant Islamists who abducted scores of schoolgirls in April. A Yobe police official in Damaturu told CNN the extremist group had distributed leaflets to the viewing centers in three different languages warning them not to open during the World Cup. Maina Ularamu, a local official in Madagali, in Adamawa state, also confirmed to CNN that people in the town -- which has been the target of previous Boko Haram attacks -- had been warned against watching the soccer matches. ""Letters have been distributed to viewing centers in Adamawa state warning people not to gather to watch the World Cup games,"" she said. ""We suspect these letters to be from Boko Haram. People are very afraid and are not leaving their homes."" According to a police official, ""This is Boko Haram's area of operations.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- With less than half an hour to spare, Chen Zhu calmly emerged from the subway station connected to the massive Beijing West Railway Station with a small, wheeled bag. Upon retrieving her ticket from a kiosk, Chen breezed through the security checkpoint before scanning her ticket to open an automated gate leading to the platform. Five minutes after boarding, she was reading a book as her bullet train pulled out of the station precisely on time. For this young journalist who frequently travels for work, these steps have become part of an increasingly appealing routine amid worsening air traffic congestion at major airports across China. ""Flights out of Beijing are always delayed,"" Chen said. ""Door to door, high-speed trains are often faster than flying for me. ""I usually get to the station last minute and board the train right before departure. The service is just so punctual."" China's fast-expanding high-speed rail network is now the world's busiest with daily ridership exceeding 1.3 million. On morning of Chen's journey, train G511 raced through the countryside at 300 kmph (186 mph) from Beijing to the central city of Wuhan in just five hours -- less than half the time of the regular rail route. The new link between Beijing and Wuhan opened last December and added to what has become the world's longest high-speed rail line, running almost 2,300 kilometers (1,429 miles) from the Chinese capital to the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. Read more: What female business travelers want in hotels . Although Chen still prefers to fly on longer routes, she says on business trips shorter than six hours, the choice of train over plane is now a no-brainer. ""I work or read on the train,"" she said, highlighting the benefit of uninterrupted mobile phone reception. ""It's great that everyone has access to a power outlet."" At $85, her second-class seat costs less than half of a full-fare economy-class plane ticket on this major business route. Now the world's second-largest economy, and flush with cash, China has been busy purchasing foreign rail technologies and building high-speed lines. The Chinese government, which owns and operates all domestic rail companies, launched the country's first high-speed service in 2007 and now boasts 9,300 kilometers (5,778 miles) of high-speed routes nationwide, turning a nonexistent network into the world's longest in a few short years. ""In less than a decade, we constructed more high-speed rail lines than what it took Japan and Europe 40 years to build,"" said Zhao Jian, an economics professor at Beijing Jiaotong University and one of the country's leading experts on rail transportation. ""We've had such amazing growth because land expropriation is cheap and so is labor,"" he explained. ""You also have the economy of scale -- other countries usually build a few hundred kilometers of tracks, but in China we're talking about thousands of kilometers."" Read more: Want an office with room service? Although Zhao is often cited as a skeptical voice in the development of high-speed rail in China, even he is impressed after taking a few rides. ""I've taken high-speed trains in Japan, Germany, France, South Korea and Taiwan,"" he said. ""Ours offer the smoothest and fastest ride in the world."" The massive investments and rapid construction, however, have raised public concerns over the new service's safety record and commercial viability, amid state media reports of empty trains traveling between inconvenient new stations in less-developed provinces. Already, rail officials have slowed down some bullet trains -- originally planned to run as fast as 380 kmph (236 mph) -- to make the service safer and cheaper. ""Raising the speed to 350kmph (217 mph) or 380 kmph (236 mph) would lower built-in safety redundancies, and greatly increase wear-and-tear and operating costs,"" Zhao said. ""It's not the faster, the better."" During most of her journey, Chen's train was only half full, but that hasn't dampened her enthusiasm for her favorite mode of transportation. ""I think in parts of the country, taking high-speed trains will be like taking buses in the future,"" she said. The Chinese government is reportedly spending some $300 billion to make that vision a reality, moving full steam ahead on its plan to build a 25,000-kilometer (15,534 mile) high-speed rail network by 2020.","China's high-speed rail network is now the world's busiest with daily ridership exceeding 1.3 million .

"(CNN) -- One can hardly read the news these days without learning that yet another American corporation has announced plans to invert, which is corporate-speak for restructuring as a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes. It's a trend that has increased exponentially over the past decade with barely a peep from Congress. Now that corporate giants such as Pfizer, Walgreen, Medtronic and Mylan have made bids to invert by merging with foreign companies and will be eligible to claim their headquarters are offshore to avoid U.S. taxes, Congress may finally act. These large corporations have publicly asserted they are moving their headquarters, but they really won't change the way they do business. Medtronic, for example, is buying an Ireland-based company. If the merger goes through, the company has said it will maintain ""operational headquarters"" in Minneapolis, where the company is currently based. In other words, not much will change except the company will claim to be foreign. (Medtronic officials say the move is not about avoiding taxes and that the firm will still face substantial taxes; the firm does have the right to cancel the deal if Congress changes the law in a way that removes the tax benefits of inversion.) Walgreen, the nation's largest drug retailer, has said it is considering moving its headquarters to Switzerland. Inversions are just another ploy that corporations use to reduce or eliminate their U.S. tax bills. According to the Congressional Research Service, legislation to limit corporate inversions could provide an additional $19.5 billion in revenue over 10 years. Even among corporations that aren't pursing inversions, shifting profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes is a huge problem. For example, American corporations reported to the IRS that subsidiaries in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands collectively earned profits equal to 16 times the gross domestic product of those countries, according to recent data. It's clearly impossible for companies to earn profits in a country that are exponentially larger than that country's entire economy, further proving companies are using accounting gimmicks to avoid U.S. taxes. American corporations engage in these tricks because they can defer paying U.S. taxes on alleged offshore earnings until they officially bring those profits to the United States, which may never happen. Corporations get a permanent break when they invert because the United States will not tax profits earned outside its borders. Corporate inversions are often followed by earnings stripping, a maneuver that artificially shifts profits into lower-tax or zero-tax countries. A recent exposÃ© explains how the highly profitable manufacturer Ingersoll Rand suddenly began reporting U.S. losses or very small profits each year after inverting to become a Bermuda corporation in 2001. This did not reflect any actual loss of U.S. customers or business. Rather, the corporation accomplished this by loaning $3 billion to its U.S. subsidiary, which then deducted the interest payments on the debt to effectively wipe out its U.S. income for tax purposes. Defenders of corporate inversions often argue the United States' 35% statutory corporate tax rate is too high compared to that of other nations and therefore puts companies at a competitive disadvantage, but most U.S. companies pay nowhere near that rate. Defenders also claim profits earned in the United States will always be taxed here. But the earnings stripping practiced by Ingersoll Rand and other inverted companies suggests this is not true. The ultimate goal of much multinational tax planning is making profits appear to be earned in countries with a zero or low tax rate. Reducing the nation's corporate tax rate cannot address the fact that many corporations are employing various means to avoid U.S. taxes altogether. Companies that have recently sought inversions continue to benefit vastly from public investments. The drugs and devices made by Pfizer and Medtronic, which are often sold by Walgreen, would have far fewer buyers if not for Medicaid, Medicare and other federal health programs. They would not exist without federal investments in research and education and in the infrastructure that makes commerce possible. Taxpayers should be outraged that these companies have no qualms about benefiting immensely from the U.S. economic system without contributing their fair share. But Congress can easily fix this by moving forward with a White House proposal to bar corporations that are obviously American from pretending to be foreign. The plan would sensibly treat newly merged companies as American if they are majority owned by shareholders of the original American company, or if they are managed and controlled inside the United States and have substantial business here. There's much more to be done to reform America's tax code, but we can't afford to wait for lawmakers to settle how to approach that challenge. If Congress waits too long, there won't be much of a corporate tax left to reform.","U.S. corporations merge with foreign companies, move their headquarters .

"(CNN) -- Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina, the new pope, is breaking historic ground by choosing the name Francis. It's the first time the name is being used by a pope, said CNN Vatican expert John Allen. Pope Francis chose his name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi because he is a lover of the poor, said Vatican deputy spokesman Thomas Rosica. ""Cardinal Bergoglio had a special place in his heart and his ministry for the poor, for the disenfranchised, for those living on the fringes and facing injustice,"" Rosica said. St. Francis, one of the most venerated figures in the Roman Catholic Church, was known for connecting with fellow Christians, Rosica added. 5 things to know about the new pope .

""At that moment St. Francis was called to repair the small church, but the ruinous state of the building was a symbol of the dramatic and disquieting situation of the Church herself,"" Pope Benedict XVI said. ""At that time the Church had a superficial faith which did not shape or transform life, a scarcely zealous clergy, and a chilling of love.""

The U.S. pulled its combat troops out of Iraqi cities and towns back on June 30th. That left security responsibilities to the Iraqis. But violence has been on the rise since then, and yesterday marked the deadliest day in the nation since the end of June. At least 95 people were killed and more than 560 others were wounded by six explosions across Baghdad, including two that targeted government buildings. Authorities said that two people who were believed to be connected to the attacks were arrested yesterday. Iraq's prime minister said the bombings will force the country to re-evaluate its security plans. But American officials said the attacks won't stop Iraqis from building a peaceful society and won't stop the U.S. from helping with those efforts. Afghan Election Day . AZUZ: U.S. forces are also helping out in Afghanistan today, as that country holds just the second presidential election in its history. Security has been a big concern leading up to the event. Several election workers were killed in attacks this week, and the Taliban has vowed to disrupt the voting with violence. That's why American Marines and Afghan soldiers have been deployed to help protect voters. Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission estimates that there are about 17 million registered voters in the country. That's about 4.6 million more than in 2004 during the last election. Many of them live in remote areas. In order to get them voting supplies, officials are using helicopters, cars, even donkeys. Ivan Watson went along for the ride to one of these polling places and he tells us about the preparations leading up to today's election.

We're escorting this truck up ahead of us -- in the dust, you might be able to see it -- and it's taking ballot boxes up to some of the polling stations here in Afghanistan's central Bamiyan province. As you can see, security is important here, even though this is one of the safest provinces in the country. Despite that good track record, election workers say, in some parts of the province, they've heard of armed men going house to house, warning people not to vote. And also, there's been a spike in violence and insurgent attacks over the past three months, as insurgents have tried to disrupt this election process. Now, you can tell the roads here are not paved. Despite the fact that Bamiyan is one of the safest provinces in the country -- it's been spared the daily car bombs and roadside bombs that the south and the east of the country have seen, and some of the assassination attacks -- it still hasn't really benefited from reconstruction. There are fewer than five miles, five kilometers of paved road in this entire province. And that makes this election a real logistical challenge. You can see the posters over there of some of the candidates for provincial council and for president. People here, they say they are going to participate in the elections. And there is a lot of support here for the incumbent president, Hamid Karzai, in part because some of the traditional ethnic Hazara leaders, this is a predominantly ethnic Hazara province, they have endorsed the incumbent president, Hamid Karzai.

In fact, this is the seventh time that the launch has been postponed since the program was started in 2002. Engineers say this week's delay is due to a technical glitch, and it will take at least three days to figure out what went wrong and try again. South Korea is hoping that the rocket, which cost about $400 million, will jump-start its space program. The ultimate goal is to send an unmanned probe to the moon by 2025. Discovery Launch .

It's the Gibson Dark Fire, which is based on the famous Gibson Les Paul classic guitar, but with a microprocessor inside, taking studio effects out on the road. HALPEN: With the advantage of digital audio and recording systems that are available in-house, to where everyone can do it themselves. This allows you to tap into those abilities and get all sorts of different sounds that were never possible with a regular guitar. BARRAL: The guitar tones itself, just by turning the master control knob, one can change to any of 18 different tones. With a small servo motor on each tuning key, it looks like magic. The guitar also has a technology called ""chameleon"" that can simulate several classical sounds, sounds that use to depend on the different types of wood a guitar is made from, like a classic electric guitar or an acoustic guitar to a more jazzy sound. HALPEN: Guitar players are generally kind of looking to the past for what they've always liked sound wise. And what this does is lets you get all those classic sounds from the past, staples of rock music, jazz music and all that from one guitar. BARRAL: The guitar can also be connected to a nearby computer that gives more choices: the type of amplifier you use, the equalization, effects and even record a ""loop"" and play on top of it, all live. For some guitarists, this is the evolution of sound: endless turning possibilities, cutting edge technology and the ability to produce different sounds with just one click.

"(CNN) -- The peculiar standoff on Borneo between Malaysian security forces and a group of men from the southern Philippines has its roots in a recent landmark peace deal between Manila and Muslim rebels, according to an expert on the region. More than 100 men from the mainly Muslim southern Philippines came ashore in the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo early last week demanding to be recognized as representatives of a sultanate that has historical claims on the area. Their claims touch on an unresolved territorial question between the Philippines and Malaysia, as well as Manila's efforts to improve relations with Islamic insurgents in the country's south after decades of violence. Malaysian police and armed forces soon surrounded the village in the eastern Sabah district of Lahad Datu where the men had gathered. Police officials said they were negotiating with the group in an effort to persuade its members to return to their homes in the Philippines peacefully. The Philippine government also urged them to come back to the country, saying it hadn't authorized their voyage. There was no indication of a resolution to the standoff on Monday. The men claim to be the Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu, which once encompassed Sabah, and say they don't want their people to be sent away from the area, Malaysian authorities said. There are conflicting claims about to what extent the men are armed. Eroded power . Over the weekend, comments appeared in the news media from representatives of the sultanate, whose power is now largely symbolic, saying that their followers who had gone to Sabah planned to stay where they were. ""Nobody will be sent to the Philippines. Sabah is our home,"" Jamalul Kiram, a member of the sultanate's ruling family, told reporters in Manila on Sunday, according to Agence France-Presse. The sultanate's claim to Sabah plays a long-standing and important role in the Philippine government's relationship with the country's Muslim minority and with neighboring Malaysia, said Julkipli Wadi, the dean of the Institute of Islamic Studies at the University of the Philippines. Established in the 15th century, the Sultanate of Sulu became an Islamic power center in Southeast Asia that at one point ruled Sabah. But the encroachment of Western colonial powers, followed by the emergence of the Philippines and Malaysia as independent nation states, steadily eroded the sultanate's power, according to Wadi. It became ""a sultanate without a kingdom"" to rule over, he said. Sulu is now a province within the Republic of the Philippines. But the sultanate has nonetheless retained influence over some people in the southern Philippines and Sabah who still identify themselves with it, according to Wadi. Excluded from a peace deal . The members of the sultanate's royal family, although riven by internal disputes over who the rightful sultan is today, appear to have felt isolated by the provisional accord signed in October by the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has fought for decades to establish an independent Islamic state in southern Philippines. Malaysia, a mainly Muslim country, helped facilitate the agreement. Kiram was cited by AFP as saying that the sultanate's exclusion from the deal, which aims to set up a new autonomous region to be administered by Muslims, prompted the decision to send the men to Sabah this month. Dispatching the boat loads of followers to Lahad Datu served to make the sultanate's presence felt, according to Wadi. ""The whole aim is not to create conflict or initiate war, it is just to position themselves and make governments like Malaysia and the Philippines recognize them,"" he said. Historical ties . The economic, cultural and historical links between Sabah and the nearby Philippines islands, as well as the porous nature of the border between the two, means that many of the Filipino men have friends and relatives in Lahad Datu. But the historical connection still fuels tensions between Malaysia and the Philippines, with Manila retaining a ""dormant claim"" to Sabah through the Sultanate of Sulu, according to the CIA World Factbook. According to the official Philippine News Agency, Manila still claims much of the eastern part of Sabah, which was leased to the British North Borneo Company in 1878 by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 1963, Britain transferred Sabah to Malaysia, a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal. Malaysia still pays a token rent to the sultanate for the lease of Sabah, according to Wadi.","More than 100 Filipinos arrived by boat on the Malaysian coast last week .
They say they represent a sultanate that once ruled the area .

"(CNN) -- At a moment when diplomacy is back in the international spotlight, are Americans becoming more isolationist, wanting the United States to pull back from the world? You might think so listening to Washington. Republicans like Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are betting their presidential aspirations on it. Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik released a memo identifying ""pull back from the rest of the world"" as the No. 1 area of consensus across the political spectrum ahead of the 2014 elections. And, at first, it looks like they may be on to something. But as you dig deeper, you might see they are missing the point. Yes, poll after poll has shown that if you ask Americans to choose between focusing on problems at home or abroad, they overwhelmingly call for focusing at home. A recent IPSOS/Halifax International Security Forum poll released last week found an overwhelming 88% of Americans agreed. Along with the Obama administration's inability to muster congressional support for limited military strikes against Syria (and the British failure to win approval in their parliament), this is often seen as the latest sign of war-weary populations that don't want anything to do with international entanglements. Yet, a closer look at how Americans think about the world today provides a note of caution before joining the isolationist bandwagon. Americans are clearly reluctant to support military intervention. They may agree with former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, that anyone ""who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should 'have his head examined.'"" But rather than pulling back, Americans are looking for leadership to tackle today's most difficult global challenges, even if they aren't always sure how to deal with them. The world seems a more dangerous place than just three years ago. Compared with 2010, the poll shows that 22% more Americans see a nuclear or chemical attack in the world as a real threat, and 13% more Americans see a terrorist attack in their country as a real threat. Over this time, support for global engagement through civilian means of diplomacy and development has stayed surprisingly stable. Three-quarters of Americans agree that their country has a responsibility to be a moral leader for the world, a figure largely unchanged since 2010. They support economic sanctions against countries that behave badly and helping to respond to natural disasters or famines. Even after a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, majorities agree their country should help the growth of democracy and assist countries with less developed economies. The problem is that Americans aren't sure what will work in today's challenging world. Take Syria. It's amazing to see that 66% of Americans supported the deal to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control, while only 36% of them believed it will succeed. Americans know that today's global threats rarely have military solutions and no longer resemble the Cold War conflicts between strong states. An overwhelming majority say that, in today's world, economic power is more important than military power -- as do most people around the world. But if you ask Americans whether under some conditions war is necessary to obtain justice, three-quarters of Americans still agree, unlike most Europeans and Canadians. It is sobering to note that only in China is there stronger support for war at 80%. Part of the challenge is that Americans know the United States cannot solve today's global problems alone, but we are hardly unique in wanting to focus on economic problems at home. Among the 20 countries surveyed in the IPSOS/Halifax poll, every country but Sweden felt it should focus more on problems at home. Even 75% of Canadians agree, and Canada is the country the rest of the world regularly sees as having the most positive influence on the world. While the economy has slowly been showing signs of recovery, perhaps the desire to focus on problems at home is the continued hangover from the financial crisis. It turns out that there is only a modest difference in support for global engagement among Americans who see the economy negatively, with about 10% fewer (but still majorities) agreeing. The drop-off among those who see the economy negatively is greater (about 30%) on support for assisting countries with less developed economies. This suggests that policymakers and global development advocates need to do a better job making the economic argument that today's fastest-growing economies are in the developing world, not in our traditional trading partners in Europe and Japan, and that the emerging middle classes in Brazil, India, China and across Africa are the new markets for goods and services. All signs are that business understands this, but the public may not yet. We're seeing a remarkable resurgence of diplomacy, whether in the first steps toward a deal to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons or in the Middle East peace process. But the passionate reactions against the Iran agreement suggest that some have come to see diplomacy as weakness. This is unfortunate, as Americans are looking for leadership, not conflict, in a world that they feel is growing ever more dangerous. Let's hope that cooler heads will prevail in the months ahead and see this as an opportunity for the United States to work with our allies to lower the temperature and work to build a safer world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John K. Glenn.","Glenn: Top Republicans are betting presidential aspirations that Americans want to stay out of global hotspots .

"(CNN) -- Brazil has delivered only four of the six stadiums that will be used in June's Confederations Cup, considered a dress rehearsal for next year's World cup, on time. One of the venues -- Recife's Arena Pernambuco -- opened just a day before FIFA's April 15 deadline, which comes precisely two months ahead of the start of the continental competition. The other three cities that succeeded in delivering arenas before the deadline are Fortaleza, Salvador and Belo Horizonte, which are all now scheduling games to test the facilities. After initially setting stadiums a deadline of December 2012, FIFA had to push the date back in the face of repeated delays. Brazil will host the Confederations Cup from June 15-30, using six different stadiums in six cities across the country. However, two of the designated arenas missed the deadline: the Estadio Nacional in Brasilia and the iconic Maracana in Rio de Janeiro. Operators of the stadium in Brasilia, Brazil's capital city, say the arena is not too far behind schedule, with its opening planned for April 21. The big question mark is over the legendary Maracana, which hosted the decisive World Cup finals clash in 1950. It has repeatedly pushed back deadlines and run over budget and although officials said last week that it should be ready by April 27, that date is not considered definite. After showing some largesse in the construction of stadiums for the Confederations Cup, FIFA's Secretary General has insisted that delays will not be tolerated when it comes to the World Cup itself. ""The deadline for the FIFA World Cup stadiums delivery stands firm as December 2013. There will be no compromise,"" Jerome Valcke said in a statement. All eyes will be on Brazil when it hosts the Confederations Cup, which will also be a trial run of infrastructure -- from hotels to airports and urban transport. More than half a million tickets have already been sold and many fans will want to travel from one city to another to follow their team. ""The next few weeks will be an acid test for the host cities,"" added Valcke, who has clashed with Brazilian authorities in the past when questioning the delay in preparations for FIFA's forthcoming events. The eight-nation Confederations Cup pits continental champions against each other, with world champions Spain among the teams joining hosts Brazil in an intriguing line-up. On Sunday, Fortaleza's Castelao stadium underwent a test event as it staged a local championship match. In front of a crowd of 16,000, local organizers tested out such different areas as cleaning and refuse collection, transport, competitions, spectator services and IT. ""Every area received a very thorough assessment,"" Tiago Paes, the Stadiums Operations Manager for the Local Organizing Committee, told FIFA.com. ""There are always going to be changes here and there, but everything went off well."" The Castelao has already hosted 19 events since it was opened in the middle of January, with that number expected to rise to 30 prior to the start of the Confederations Cup. Belo Horizonte is the next arena lined up to test facilities, with the Mineirao stadium set to host the Brazil-Chile friendly on April 24.","Two stadiums scheduled to host Confederations Cup matches in June miss FIFA deadline .

"London (CNN) -- The parents of a 17-year-old girl will spend at least 25 years in a British prison for the death of their daughter after the couple's conviction Friday for killing her over her desire to live a Westernized lifestyle and become an attorney, a court spokeswoman said Friday. Chester Crown Court Judge Roderick Evans sentenced Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed to life in prison. He said the couple, who were originally from Pakistan, must be imprisoned for at least 25 years before being eligible for parole. The sentence came hours after the court found them guilty of murder in the death of Shafilea Ahmed. The girl's dismembered body was found on a riverbank in February 2004, months after she disappeared in 2003. The death was the final act in a long-running effort by the couple to get their daughter to conform to their beliefs, Detective Superintendent Geraint Jones told reporters. ""When this failed, they murdered her, a vile and disgraceful act,"" he said. In sentencing the couple, Evans said they had used ""intimidation, bullying and ... physical violence"" in an effort to force her to adopt ways they viewed as more culturally appropriate. ""Your problem was that, in what you referred to as your 'community,' Shafilea's conduct was bringing shame upon you and your concern about being shamed in your community was greater than your love of your child,"" Evans told the couple, according to a transcript provided by court officials. ""In order to rid yourselves of that problem, you killed Shafilea by suffocating her in the presence of your other four children."" Melissa Powner, a friend of the slain girl, told reporters the conviction ""brought our friend the justice she deserves."" ""If there is one thing that we pray will come from this, it is that her beautiful face and tragic story will inspire others to seek help and make them realize that this kind of vile treatment, no matter what culture or background they are from, is not acceptable and there is a way out,"" Powner said in a statement to reporters. The conviction and sentencing came just days after the girl's mother changed her long-standing denials and testified Monday that she had seen her husband attack their daughter on the night Shafilea died. Iftikhar Ahmed has denied killing his daughter. Read more: Father denies killing daughter in UK 'honor murder' case . On Monday, Farzana Ahmed testified that she had tried to intervene to protect the girl, but her husband pushed her away and punched her, according to CNN affiliate ITV. She said she was ""extremely scared"" when she fled the room and stayed in a bedroom with other children until she heard a car leaving 20 minutes later. When her husband returned alone, she said, she asked where her daughter was. ""If you care for your dear life and that of your children, don't ever ask me this question again,"" he told her, ITV reported. Farzana Ahmed testified Monday that only one of their children, Mevish, was present when she saw her husband attacking Shafilea. Another of the couple's children, Alesha, testified last month that she saw her parents kill her sister. Alesha said her parents were angry that Shafilea was wearing a short-sleeved, V-neck top, and no sweater, on the night she was killed. ""Just end it here,"" Farzana said to Iftikhar, according to their daughter. They pushed Shafilea onto a sofa and suffocated the struggling girl, Alesha testified. Prosecutor Andrew Edis called it ""an act of suffocation by both parents acting together."" Police will review evidence that came out during trial and could decide to seek additional charges, Detective Chief Inspector Chris Ankers said. ""It's clear that there are a lot of things in play here,"" he said. Prosecutor Helen Morris used the verdict as an opportunity to urge others who may be suffering or fearful of similar violence and abuse to come forward and ""put your faith in the criminal justice system."" So-called honor killings, in which members of a family kill relatives because of behavior that they say shames the family, claim about 5,000 lives a year around the world, according to the United Nations Population Fund. In England, the Crown Prosecution Service handled 234 crimes involving alleged ""honor violence"" in 2011. About half resulted in convictions. CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","NEW: Couple more concerned about shame than their daughter, judge scolds .

"(CNN) -- The 2014 Grammy Awards are in the books, and in typical fashion, there were some notable moments. These five were among the best: . 1. Daft Punk and their dancin' friends perform ""Get Lucky."" The recorded version of ""Get Lucky"" -- which went on to win record of the year -- already featured Pharrell's vocals and Nile Rodgers' distinctive guitar. But the Grammys' added attraction was Stevie Wonder, who dominated the awards in the mid-'70s (he has three album of the year honors). Wonder can still bring out the best in his collaborators -- including the robot-headed Daft Punk, who played from the ""control room"" of the recording studio set and moved like, well, robots. Still, the group would make for a great tour. 2. Old royalty, new royalty . The Beatles' Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr were in the audience and earned frequent shout outs from such presenters as host LL Cool J, Dave Grohl and Jamie Foxx. (You'd think there was some kind of Beatles' anniversary coming up.) But there was also plenty of deference to Jay Z and Beyonce. The pair led off the show with a rousing version of ""Drunk in Love,"" and Jay Z later won a Grammy for rap/sung collaboration. Jay Z mentioned his child-in-waiting, baby Blue, in his acceptance speech. Stars rock all-white ensembles . 3. Nifty performances, as usual . The Grammys always try hard to match known names with rising stars, and this year, the pairings paid off with several performances.

"London (CNN) -- London's Metropolitan Police was under fire Friday after 10 cases involving alleged racism by police officers were referred to the independent police watchdog for investigation. Eight officers and a staff member have been suspended while allegations that they used racist language are reviewed, the Metropolitan Police said. The 10 cases involve about 20 police officers and one staff member, a police spokesman said. Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said Thursday that the force, known as the Met, was taking the matter very seriously. ""I want to reiterate -- there is no room for racism in the Met,"" he said. Seven cases involving alleged racism were referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) Thursday, he said, in addition to three that are under review. The record of the Metropolitan Police has been tarnished by claims of racism in the past. A government inquiry ordered in the wake of a bungled investigation into the murder of a black teenager nearly 20 years ago labeled the Metropolitan Police force ""institutionally racist"" and a raft of recommendations were made to stamp out the issue. The new allegations follow the release by the Guardian newspaper last week of mobile phone footage that appeared to show a police officer directing racist remarks at a young black man arrested after the riots in London last summer. The complaints commission said three of the cases under investigation involve officers in Newham, east London. One case concerns racist comments alleged to have been made within a group of officers between January and March this year, the commission said. The three officers involved have been suspended, the watchdog said. Other investigations in Newham involve a 15-year-old boy who was allegedly assaulted by an officer and an allegation that a 21-year-old man was the victim of racist remarks and assault by Met officers, the commission said. Prosecutors initially decided not to take action against three officers accused of misconduct in the second of those cases but that decision is now under review, the complaints commission said. IPCC commissioner Mike Franklin said many members of the public would be concerned that Newham officers were accused in more than one case. ""Undoubtedly, these are very serious allegations and I would like to reassure the Newham community and wider public, that we are conducting a full, thorough and independent investigation to establish the facts behind these allegations,"" he said. Mackey said the vast majority of the force's 50,000 or so staff, including 32,000 officers, ""act with the professionalism and high standards we expect,"" and that unacceptable behavior would be challenged. ""Whilst any use of racist language is abhorrent, what is reassuring for me is that in the 10 cases that have been referred to the IPCC, six involve other officers who have stood up and raised concerns, showing that we are an organization that will not stand for any racist behavior,"" he said. ""The Met does not tolerate racism."" The National Black Police Association said last week that the decision by prosecutors not to act on the claims of assault and racist remarks against three officers highlighted the issue of racism and the criminal justice system. The association is ""deeply concerned that this issue undermines efforts to build and maintain trust and confidence of communities grappling with the impact of serious violent crime and escalating hate crimes,"" it said in a statement. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","Eight officers and a member of staff are suspended, the Metropolitan Police says .

"(CNN) -- Workers have walked off the job at one of the world's largest shoe factories, leading apparel maker Adidas to temporarily shift its production. As many as 50,000 employees are on strike at Yue Yuen Industrial, a major Adidas and Nike supplier in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan. Activists say it's one of China's largest worker strikes ever. ""This is a result of the long-term exploitation of this big enterprise,"" said Suki Chung, the executive director of Hong Kong nonprofit Labor Action China. ""Workers' demands are very clear."" Strikers say that they are not being paid the full amount of social insurance and housing benefits owed to them. Additionally, they say their work contracts are fraudulent, preventing them from enrolling their children in local schools. The factory offered last weekend to recalculate its social insurance and housing benefit payments to workers, but did not offer new contracts. The strikers refused the offer. Adidas responds . Adidas spokeswoman Katja Schreiber said the company was moving some of its future orders from Yue Yuen Dongguan to its other suppliers. ""At the same time, we'd like to point out that we are not pulling out of the Yue Yuen factory in Dongguan and we have no plans to do so,"" she said. Nike spokesman Greg Rossiter said the company was in touch with factory management, but did not say whether the company would move production to other facilities. Teresa Cheng, an organizer with the International Union League for Brand Responsibility, slammed Adidas for moving some of its orders. ""This is the typical behavior of Adidas,"" she said. ""Adidas systematically withdraws its orders and moves them to factories with more exploitative conditions, essentially punishing workers who dare to stand up to sweatshop abuse."" To support strikers at Yue Yuen, Cheng's group has organized protests at Adidas and Nike stores in Tapei, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Los Angeles, New York City, and Melbourne. China's massive manufacturing sector has slowed in recent months, and many companies have shifted production to China's inland provinces or countries with cheaper labor. According to Suki Chung, workers in southern China are now worried about long-term job security, leading them to ask for more than just higher wages. ""Workers are in a very insecure position,"" she said. ""They are paranoid they will lose their jobs. If they don't fight at the moment, the factory could be gone very soon."" Activist detained . Zhang Zhiru, a labor rights activist who aided the strike and advised workers, was detained by state security agents Tuesday for two days. ""They took my phone and didn't allow me to contact anyone,"" he said. ""I think they released me because of outside pressure, saying it was illegal for them to detain me."" Despite the incident, Zhang vowed to press on. ""I prepared myself to face these sorts of things when I decided to protect the rights of the public,"" he said. ""If the workers ask me for help again, I will still help them.""

"(CNN) -- Mark Covert is something of a celebrity in the running world. Every year around this time, his phone starts to ring off the hook as he passes another milestone in his ""running streak"" -- the number of consecutive days he's logged at least a mile. This week he hit 44 years, or 16,075 days in a row. It's the longest active streak ever recorded by the United States Running Streak Association. His closest competitor is Jon Sutherland, who's logged 15,768 days. Covert, now 61, started his streak on July 23, 1968, as a high school senior. In 1970 he was named the NCAA individual cross country champion, and he helped his California State University, Fullerton cross country team grab a NCAA Division II title the year after. In 1972, Covert placed seventh at the U.S. Olympic marathon trials. Covert, now a coach and teacher at Antelope Valley College in Lancaster, California, still logs between 35 and 45 miles a week. We caught up with him to ask for his ""streaking"" tips. The following is an edited version of that interview: . Why did you start running every day? I had no idea this was going to happen. The summer after I graduated, early in my freshman year of college, I realized I was in 100 days without missing one. I wondered if I could get a year in without missing. That became a little bit of a goal. That year turned to two, to three. At four or five years, I thought, this is a big deal. I truly look forward to putting my shoes on every day. ... It's something that makes me feel better, something that in a lot of ways is therapeutic -- not only physically but mentally. It's something I enjoy. What's your running routine like? I run in the morning. There's no real set time, just earlier in the morning. I usually run between 50 to 60 minutes. Some days I go shorter, some days I run 80 minutes. I'm sure I don't run as fast as I used to. I tell people the trees pass me by real slow now, but that's OK. I'm still getting something out of it. How do you fuel your run? I eat nothing before I go run. I'm up for maybe half an hour, then go out the door. When I come back, I eat a regular breakfast -- oatmeal one day, toast with peanut butter and jelly another day. As I've gotten older, you try to eat a little bit better and little bit wiser. Lunch, usually an apple and some almonds. Dinner is chicken, fish, a salad, vegetables. One of the things I struggle with is my weight. As I've gotten older ... my weight has kind of crept up. That's a never-ending battle. Do you struggle to drag yourself out of bed in the morning? I don't have any problem getting out of bed in the morning. I have a sleep disorder, so I wake up early -- four o'clock. Getting out the door and running for me has never been a problem. When I was younger, when I was in college, I was training for races and things like that and it was something I was committed to being the best I can be. As I've gotten older, it's something that's just ingrained. Was there any day that you thought, 'I'm just not going to be able to run today'? The two most recent ones -- seven years ago I had surgery on my knee. The day after that was a challenge, but I was able to get out and get a mile in. Fifteen months ago, I hurt my back. That was really a challenge because it was hard to walk, hard to bend over. I hurt it running and when I got back I went to the doctor and he was able to give me a little bit of relief. But the three or four days after that were really uncomfortable and painful. I'm assuming your doctor told you not to run. (Laughs) I've surrounded myself with great doctors over the years that have kind of bought into this craziness. They understand if they told me 'No' I'd go out and try to do it anyway. They'd never say, 'Go out and try this' if it was going to cause real damage. They've been really tremendously supportive. How do you push through aches and pains? I slow things down a whole lot -- stay within things that are manageable. I try not to do things that are going to make it a lot worse. People that have these running streaks like this, our pain threshold is a little bit higher than most. Most of the time I find after 10 or 15 minutes I tend to warm up a little bit and find I can move along a little bit better. How do you get through that last mile? You're trying to finish your run up pretty strong, whether it be a mile, half mile or 10 minutes from your house. It's a matter of bearing down and concentrating on what you want to get out of that workout at the time. I've always thought that you have to become somewhat comfortable with being uncomfortable. When you're working out, we all feel a little bit uncomfortable.And this might sound ridiculous, but I kind of like feeling uncomfortable -- I think there's great benefit from that, physically and psychologically. That's something, I think, in that last mile finishing up, you just have to wrap yourself up in that uncomfortable feeling and kind of go with it.","Mark Covert has run at least a mile every day for 44 years .

"(CNN) -- Some off-duty public safety workers ended up with an unusual catch when they went fishing off the coast of Florida on Saturday morning. They found a man and woman splashing in the water 7 miles from shore who said they'd spent the last 14 hours treading water, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said. Sean McGovern, 50, and Mellisa Morris, 52, said they'd fallen off their boat in Key Largo about 6 p.m. Friday. The boat was in gear, and they watched it pull away from them, the sheriff's department said. ""They are very lucky â€” they didn't have any signal device,"" said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Mark Barney. ""They were trying to signal people down with their T-shirt. To be located and recovered by off-duty cops and a firefighter â€” that's a stroke of luck right there."" About 8 a.m. Saturday, two Broward sheriff's detectives, a Broward firefighter and one of the officers' father-in-law noticed splashing in the water from their boat, the sheriff's department said. ""We saw birds diving,"" said Adam White, a detective. ""As we got closer, I saw fish jumping. We saw a white male with his shirt flagging us down."" The men pulled McGovern and Morris onto the boat. They were exhausted after drifting 10 nautical miles and appeared to have mild hypothermia and jellyfish stings, the sheriff's department said. ""We checked them out, made sure they were stable,"" White said. The fishermen passed them over to the Coast Guard, which carried them to the Fort Lauderdale Coast Guard station. Friends picked them up there. ""A lot of people don't wear life jackets because they don't have intention of being in water,"" Barney said. ""It was a miracle they were able to tread water that long and were safely recovered."" White summed it up: ""They're pretty lucky."" And what happened to the boat from which the swimmers fell? The Coast Guard said it washed up on the beach in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday afternoon.","NEW: Boat comes ashore .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- ""The Earth is just too small,"" sighed South African adventurer Mike Horn, one of the few people on the planet who can get away with saying such a statement. Action man of climate change: Horn is hoping to inspire a new generation of leaders. During the past eight months the 43-year-old has sailed around the world twice and during a life of exploration, often living on the edge of survival, he has trekked to both poles, sailed solo across oceans and walked across almost every continent. The challenge for Horn now is to find the challenge. Even his first trek to the South Pole earlier this year, a dream he'd had childhood, left him underwhelmed. ""I think it was just an overrated experience,"" he told CNN. ""You were walking to civilization, away from the edge of Antarctica, which is completely wild, to the pole where there's an American base, airplanes landing everyday, red lights telling you if you can cross the runway or not. If I can't satisfy myself walking to the pole and back, let's try and do something else."" That something else is pursuing a different type of adventure: motivating a new generation to take action to conserve the planet in the face of climate change. Using a specially designed and made 35-meter exploration boat called Pangaea, Horn is showing a lucky few parts of the world unreachable to most. Nearly a year into the four-year Pangaea Expedition, he's been more than encouraged by what he's seen in his ""young explorers"" selected from across the world. ""I haven't been disappointed by one of them. They're not polluted by politics or money. I'm not changing their lives, they're changing them themselves. I'm just taking them to somewhere it's nearly impossible for them to go without the boat, infrastructure and my knowledge,"" he said. It's a knowledge he said he has gained through hard experience; he lost the tips of fingers to frost bite in the Arctic and claims to have narrowly avoided execution at the hands of militia in DR Congo. His desire to preserve nature in a changing world stems from his respect for it. ""To come back alive [from an expedition], you haven't conquered nature, you've just managed to live in harmony with it. That is true competition to me. There's no start or end to it. Adventure becomes a way of living, an inner search of your knowledge,"" he said.  View the gallery of Mike Horn's adventures » . Spirit for adventure . Horn's adventurous spirit manifested itself early. Growing up in South Africa he was given his first bike at age 8 and set off to visit his uncle, not the one 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) away, but the one nearly 300 kilometers away. While his parents encouraged him to explore, a degree in Human Movement Science and honors degree in marketing gave him a greater of a sense of the psychology of competition. Time with the South African military's Special Forces fighting in Angola gave him a harsh lesson in survival and the difference between life and death. And a wife and two children who live in Switzerland remind him not to push it too far on his solo expeditions. Now when choosing the teenagers and young adults to join his expeditions he looks for things in them he saw in himself at that age; a curiosity and enthusiasm similar to his own and that continues to keep him motivated every day. Lecturers join Pangaea's voyages to add some scientific knowledge to Horn's first-hand understanding of the world, and there are ongoing projects for the young explorers to pursue when their time on the boat is over. Yet it is action, not words, that defines Horn. ""I think it's time to act more than anything else. Why discuss global warming and what are we going to do, if we can basically go out and do it?"" he said. ""I don't believe in global warming as such, I believe more in the climate and seasons changing. I'm not a specialist, I'm an adventurer, but maybe I've seen things that other people haven't seen that leads to what I think is a change in climate,"" he said . ""On the North Pole where before there was three to four meters of ice, today the ice breaks up, seals come through and polar bears can hunt there. When you see the big ice shelves break off around Antarctica, you think that there is something happening. I just talk about what I see."" Action, not words . He's criticized the United Nations as a talking shop and says he has rebuffed advances to become affiliated with them, but has some plans to work with environmental groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund in Indonesia, in the near future. ""Politics slows down a lot. Everyone should have the freedom of speech and with organizations usually you have to keep to the protocol, but there's no protocol when it comes to the world and the future of the planet,"" he said. He's equally tired of adventures or projects that just raise awareness of climate change. ""We have to have a different approach, not that the one I have is completely right, but an approach where you have to build a boat out of plastic bottles... is that something we really must do? It's not enough to just take water samples and say the planet is warming up, or say there is plastic floating in the oceans,"" he said. ""Pangaea"" has some eco-friendly elements. As well as being able to go almost anywhere in the world's oceans, it is made from aluminum, since it is the most recyclable metal and is unpainted to reduce pollution from noxious paints usually found on ships. Part powered by solar, the crew is able to make its own water onboard and there is a plastic compactor for all the trash the boat trawls out of the oceans. Horn's single-mindedness has also secured lucrative partnerships with some big-name brands that bankroll his missions. Mercedes Benz are contracted to change Pangaea's engines every year with the most efficient model; next year they will get one with zero CO2 emissions. ""It gives them something to work on and me an opportunity to stay with my philosophy. There are some [companies] that don't give a s**t; you mustn't preach to the converted. That's why it's important to get companies involved that might change their mindset."" Horn is positive that he can make a difference through educating his young charges and the problems many fear are impossible to solve, can be dealt with. ""I came back after the expedition around the Arctic and the North Pole and I saw 'An Inconvenient Truth' and I thought, 'It's not that bad.' The world is still a beautiful place. Let's conserve that beauty and teach [the younger generation] how to conserve it.""","Explorer Mike Horn aims to encourage new generation to take action on conservation .

"(CNN) -- One of the jurors who convicted Michael Dunn of attempted murder after he fired into an SUV during a fatal argument believes he should have been convicted of first-degree murder. ""I believed he was guilty,"" Valerie said in an interview with ABC's ""Nightline"" early Wednesday. Also known as Juror No. 4, she asked that her full name not be given in order to protect her identity. A Florida jury on Saturday night convicted Dunn of three charges of attempted second-degree murder for shooting into an SUV full of teenagers after arguing about their loud music. He was also convicted of one count of shooting into the vehicle. But a separate first-degree murder charge in the death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis resulted in a hung jury. Prosecutor Angela Corey said she would seek a new trial on the charge. Dunn faces 60 years or more in prison for the attempted murder charges when he's sentenced next month. Split over self-defense . On the murder charge, Valerie said the jury split over the issue of self-defense. Florida law says the use of deadly force is justifiable if someone reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. In his testimony, Dunn insisted that Davis threatened him and that he saw a gun. Police never recovered a weapon. Valerie said the jury's first vote was 10-2 in favor of a murder conviction. Over nearly 30 hours of deliberations, the vote became 9-3. Attempted murder conviction . Ultimately, the jury convicted Dunn on the charges of attempted murder. Valerie said all the jurors felt Dunn crossed a line when he continued to fire at the SUV as it fled the scene in Jacksonville. In their minds, any threat Dunn may have felt before had passed. ""We all believed that there was another way out, another option,"" she said. But for Valerie, it never should have happened at all. Dunn could have chosen another path. ""Roll your window up, ignore the taunting, put your car in reverse ... move a parking spot over. That's my feeling."" Ron Davis, the victim's father, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" he believed Dunn should have been found guilty of first-degree murder. But the father said he thought jurors tried hard to render a just decision. ""We believe absolutely with all of our hearts that they did everything that they could to come to what they believe was the most just decision,"" said Jordan Davis' mother, Lucia McBath. ""We do now know that they were torn."" Jailhouse phone calls . The revelations from the juror come after prosecutors released recordings of nine phone calls Dunn made while he awaited trial in a Florida jail. Some of the conversations were mundane, while others revealed a man who calls himself the victim and the victor. ""Like, I'm the f***ing victim here,"" Dunn said. ""I was the one who was victimized."" ""I mean, I don't know how else to put it,"" Dunn continued. ""They attacked me. I'm the victim. I'm the victor, but I was the victim too."" Other comments by Dunn highlighted his negative perception of the teens. ""When the police said that these guys didn't have a record I was like, you know, I wonder if they're just flying under the radar,"" he told his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer. ""Because they were bad."" Gas station confrontation . It was November 23, 2012, when Dunn pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville, parking next to a red Dodge Durango with four teenagers inside. The teens had come in for gum and cigarettes; Dunn, meanwhile, had just left his son's wedding with his fiancee, who'd gone inside the convenience store for wine and chips. Dunn didn't like the loud music -- ""rap crap,"" he called it -- coming from the teens' SUV. So he asked them to turn it down. What followed next depends on whom you believe. Dunn says Davis threatened him, and he decided to take matters into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Durango. But prosecutors say it was Dunn who lost control, firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the SUV over music he didn't like. After learning almost six hours later that he had killed Davis, Dunn testified that he became ""crazy with grief,"" experiencing stomach problems for about four hours before taking a nap. ""My intent was to stop the attack, not necessarily end a life,"" he testified. ""It just worked out that way."" Yet Rouer testified that Dunn had never mentioned any weapon to her -- be it a shotgun, a stick, a barrel or a lead pipe. In fact, police found a basketball, basketball shoes, clothing, a camera tripod and cups inside the teenagers' Durango. There was no gun in the vehicle. Dunn himself never called police. The first contact he had with them was at his home in Satellite Beach as he was being apprehended. Arguing that he wasn't in a rational state of mind, Dunn admitted, ""It makes sense that I should have (contacted authorities). We didn't. I can't tell you why."" Ron Davis told ABC he wants another trial. ""I want Michael Dunn to be tried and found guilty of killing my son, letting him know that it was wrong to kill my unarmed 17-year-old,"" Davis said. ""All the other 17-year-olds out there, they shouldn't have to fear the adults with the guns that are running around here shooting them at will.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ralph Nader's presidential candidacy has received little media attention, but his latest critique of Sen. Barack Obama has come under fire for its seemingly racial overtones. Ralph Nader is running for president as an independent. Speaking with Colorado's Rocky Mountain News, Nader accused Obama of attempting to ""talk white"" and appealing to ""white guilt"" in his quest to win the White House. ""There's only one thing different about Barack Obama when it comes to being a Democratic presidential candidate. He's half African-American,"" Nader told the paper in comments published Tuesday. ""Whether that will make any difference, I don't know. I haven't heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos. Payday loans, predatory lending, asbestos, lead. What's keeping him from doing that? Is it because he wants to talk white? He doesn't want to appear like Jesse Jackson? We'll see all that play out in the next few months and if he gets elected afterwards,"" Nader added. Obama said Wednesday in Chicago, Illinois, that Nader was simply trying to ""get attention."" ""What's clear is, Ralph Nader hasn't been paying attention to my speeches,"" he said. ""Ralph Nader's trying to get attention. He's become a perennial political candidate. I think it's a shame, because if you look at his legacy ... it's an extraordinary one. ... At this point, he's somebody who's trying to get attention, whose campaign hasn't gotten any traction.""  Watch panelists weigh in on Nader's remarks » . Obama's presidential campaign earlier had called Nader's comments disappointing, and his communication's director, Robert Gibbs, said Tuesday that they were ""reprehensible and basically delusional."" ""I don't think he's spent a lot of time looking at the record of Barack Obama,"" Gibbs said on MSNBC. Nader is a longtime consumer advocate who was blamed by many Democrats for Al Gore's loss in the 2000 presidential election; they said he claimed votes that would otherwise have gone to their candidate. He said Obama's top issue should be poverty in America, given his racial heritage.  Watch Nader describe whom the Democrats should be ""going after"" » . ""I mean, first of all, the number one thing that a black American politician aspiring to the presidency should be is to candidly describe the plight of the poor, especially in the inner cities and the rural areas, and have a very detailed platform about how the poor is going to be defended by the law, is going to be protected by the law and is going to be liberated by the law,"" he said. ""Haven't heard a thing."" Nader also said Obama is making a concerted effort not to be ""another politically threatening African-American politician."" ""He wants to appeal to white guilt. You appeal to white guilt not by coming on as black is beautiful, black is powerful. Basically, he's coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure, whether it's corporate or whether it's simply oligarchic. And they love it. Whites just eat it up."" Nader formally entered the presidential race in the spring, expressing disappointment with both remaining Democratic candidates at that time. ""They are both enthralled to the corporate powers,"" he said of both Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton. ""They've completely ignored the presidential pattern of illegality and accountability; they've ignored the out of control waste-fraud military expenditures; they hardly ever mention the diversion of hundreds of billions of dollars to corporate subsidies, handouts and giveaways; and they don't talk about a living wage.""

"(CNN) -- From the air, the Namibian desert looks like it has a bad case of chicken pox. Spread across 1,100 miles of a narrow strip sit a smattering of barren polka dots, otherwise known as fairy circles. These sizable craters measure 10- to 65-feet in diameter, and represent one of nature's greatest mysteries. Over the decades, a number of theories, from alien invasion to poisonous gasses have been put forth to explain the phenomenon. Last year, a study published in the journal Science made headlines by claiming sand termites were the culprit. None of these, however, have been fully proven. ""The point is, fairy circles are still a mystery. There's been lots of work done in the field and in labs, but none could solve the issue,"" says Stephan Getzin, a scientist from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany. Nature on repeat . Getzin, along with a team of Israeli experts, recently put forth a theory of their own. Using aerial photography, they were able to study the spatial patterns of the fairy circles. The consistency and breadth of their distribution put him in mind of other landscapes whose vegetation, from a distance, also resembles a textile designer's sketchpad. ""If you go to Wikipedia and type in 'tiger bush', you'll find aerial images of a county in Niger where the vegetation forms in striped patterns. In Australia, you have [areas with grass circles known as] spinifex grass,"" he notes. ""A few days ago, a professor in California sent me an example of ring-like patterns formed in the Mojave Desert."" Getzin hypothesizes Namibia's fairy circles are formed through a similar phenomenon: self-organization. Basically, in arid climates, where water is scarce and soil nutrient-poor, plants face stiffer competition for resources. As a result, they ""organize"" themselves at a distance to maximize what limited resources are available -- ultimately forming strongly ordered patterns on the landscape. Debunking the termite . The self-organization theory comes about a year after biology professor Norbert Juergens argued in a paper published in Science that fairy circles were the work of a species of sand termite, psammotermes allocerus. Juergens' argument went that they created an underground oasis for themselves by eating the grass roots and killing them, thereby causing a subterranean water trap (without vegetation, water doesn't evaporate and remains underground). Getzin finds the explanation unlikely. ""I don't want to overstate things,"" he says. ""But there is not a single study showing that social insects can cause such large-scale homogenous distribution patterns, as revealed by our study,"" adds Getzin. ""Whereas all insect studies showed large-scale clumping of nest locations, self-organization in itself can cause homogenous spacing at those scales and even beyond to several kilometers."" Juergens based his findings on the fact that p. allocerus were the only insect species found consistently across the full stretch of desert where the circles are present, and were especially abundant around the circles. Though a tempting explanation, some experts remain unconvinced. ""There is a high correlation between fairy circles and these termites, and therefore Juergens claimed that they're the cause. But it's just a correlation, and one of the most fundamental mistakes a scientist can make is to confuse correlation with causation,"" says Walter Tschinkel, a biology professor at Florida State University who specializes in both social insect behavior and fairy circles. ""The termite theory is very appealing to people, because it's relatively easy to understand, whereas self-organization requires some knowledge or intuition for how plants work,"" he adds.

"(CNN) -- The Florida judge presiding over George Zimmerman's murder trial ruled Monday that jurors will be allowed to hear about marijuana found in Trayvon Martin's system the night he was fatally shot. Prosecutors argued the amount was so minimal that ""we just don't know"" what effect it had on Martin. They also accused the defense of trying to ""backdoor some very negative character evidence"" into the trial. But the defense said the amount found in Martin's system would have affected his judgment that night and is therefore relevant to the case. Judge Debra Nelson ruled she would allow the testimony about Martin's toxicology results in front of the jury and told the prosecutors they would be able to cross-examine the defense's witness and present rebuttal witnesses of their own. Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder for killing 17-year-old Martin in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman told police he was pursuing the teenager because there had been a rash of crime in the area. A confrontation ensued, and Zimmerman said he was forced to kill Martin. Protests were held around the country, calling for Zimmerman's arrest in Martin's death. Zimmerman was eventually charged with second-degree murder in April 2012. The case has reinvigorated national conversations about race, racial profiling and self-defense laws. Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy, took the stand on Monday to describe what he heard in the background of a 911 call made by one of Zimmerman's neighbor. ""Basically what I was listening to, I was listening to my son's last cry for help. I was listening to his life being taken and I was trying to come to grips with that -- that Trayvon was here no more. It was just tough,"" said Martin. Earlier in the day, the defense called the former lead investigator from the Sanford Police Department, Chris Serino, who said Martin told him ""no,"" under his breath, when asked if the voice belonged to his son. Another investigator, Doris Singleton, also said there was no doubt Martin told them it wasn't his son screaming for help on that 911 call. ""He was very upset, he was very sad, he hung his head, he cried,"" said Singleton. ""I was choked up myself. I had to stand back. I could feel how he must feel because I have children. I was choked up by it -- I felt horrible for him."" But Martin testified that he never said it wasn't his son. He said that he pushed his chair away from the desk where he was listening to the call and told investigators he ""couldn't tell."" The man who trained George Zimmerman how to fight also testified on Monday that the former neighborhood watch captain didn't know how to throw a punch after training for almost a year. ""He was -- and I don't really like to use this terminology -- soft, just physically soft. He was an overweight, large man -- and a very pleasant, nice man -- but physically soft,"" said Adam Pollack. Zimmerman started taking grappling classes where Pollack said trainers teach choke holds, arm locks and leg locks to students -- ""Basically make the person say, 'Uncle,'"" according to Pollack. After his school schedule changed, Zimmerman moved on to boxing training, where he didn't advance beyond learning how to jab, according to Pollack. When asked what level Zimmerman was at right before the shooting, Pollack said, ""He's still learning how to punch. He didn't really know how to effectively punch."" ""Did he ever get to the point where he could box somebody else?"" asked defense attorney Mark O'Mara. ""Absolutely not,"" said Pollack. At one point during his testimony, Pollack stepped down from the witness stand to mount defense attorney O'Mara, who lay on the ground. O'Mara wanted Pollack to show what the technique ""ground and pound"" looks like. A witness who saw the fight between Zimmerman and Martin testified earlier in the trial that it looked like a ""ground and pound"" and that Zimmerman was on the bottom. Pollack showed how the person on top usually has the advantage in this position, which is associated with mixed martial arts fighting. Pollack demonstrated how his knees would be placed above the person's waist and explained how gravity helps the person on top punch the person on the bottom. In a continued effort to show Zimmerman was not the aggressor in the altercation, the defense also called a slew of his friends on Monday to identify the voice heard screaming in the background of the 911 call made by a neighbor. John Donnelly, a former Vietnam War combat medic, grew emotional on the stand in the George Zimmerman trial Monday as he explained why he thought the screams for help heard on a 911 call made the night Trayvon Martin died were made by his friend, Zimmerman. Donnelly was just one of a group of defense witnesses who testified on the trial's 10th day about the controversial 911 call, which has become a key point of contention in the case. Choking back tears, Donnelly explained that the reason he could identify the screams is because of his experience with the fog of war. During combat, Donnelly had to recognize the screams of his fellow soldiers and run to them when they needed help. He said he has heard a 250-pound man scream like a little girl. ""In the midst of combat, there are a lot people yelling and screaming,"" said Donnelly. ""Sometimes they are screaming for help."" Donnelly told the court that he views Zimmerman as a ""son,"" but his close relationship with Zimmerman would not affect his testimony. Donnelly donated almost $3,000 to Zimmerman's defense fund and spent $1,700 on suits for Zimmerman to wear during the trial. Donnelly's testimony Monday was preceded by that of four of Zimmerman's other friends, who all said that they also recognized the screams on the 911 call as Zimmerman's voice. During cross-examination, prosecutors focused on potential bias -- due to their close relationships with the defendant -- on the part of the witnesses. The defense team told Nelson that it expects to introduce Martin's toxicology reports sometime on Tuesday. Testimony is expected to resume at 9 a.m. ET.","NEW: Judge allows presentation of Trayvon Martin's toxicology test that shows THC was in his system .

He left Bosnia with the belief that training in physical jihad, even for children, is crucial to the defense of Muslims when governments and outside forces fail to keep them safe. He's seen it from Afghanistan to Chechnya, he said: ""The West will not do the job."" The Egyptian-born cleric pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of terrorism-related charges in 2012. He was extradited to the United States after a lengthy legal battle. The charges against him involve giving aid to terrorist groups, including supporting efforts to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon; sending a young recruit from London to fight alongside al Qaeda on the front lines in Afghanistan; and helping kidnappers in Yemen with the 1998 abduction of a tour group. Al-Masri, who may be the only defense witness, testified he came to London as a young man because loved the Western lifestyle, wanted to make money and have fun. ""American style,"" he smiled. He worked as a bouncer and strip-club manager before bits of Islamic teachings from friends began to penetrate his mind, he testified. The hypocrisy of his lifestyle hit him like a slap in the face. Al-Masri would go on to become the high-profile imam of a London mosque and allegedly inspired several notorious terrorists with his sermons, including failed shoe bomber Richard Reid and 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta. He denied on the stand that he ever provided support to al Qaeda or the Taliban government. He noted that he hasn't spoken before a crowd since his 2004 arrest and that a decade in solitary confinement has eroded his memory and grasp of language. The trial has been reinvigorating, said al-Masri, and the preacher drew laughter from in the courtroom Wednesday afternoon as he used examples of marital spats to illustrate the practical application of Islamic truth. The government's three-week case against al-Masri was an effort to connect the dots between the defendant and events thousands of miles away from him, through key witnesses who often had never met him, and are testifying as government informants in exchange for leniency or protection. ""He was a trainer, a terrorist, and he used the cover of religion so he could hide in plain sight in London,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Kim in his opening statement. Weapons and gas masks were found at al-Masri's London mosque, the prosecutor said: ""Tools of war stockpiled in a place of worship."" Defense lawyer Joshua Dratel told the jury in his opening statement that no evidence links the cleric to the alleged crimes -- ""not in Yemen, not in Oregon, not in Afghanistan."" Dratel said his client ""never gave directions or orders to people"" and served merely as a ""commenter on events and issues"" when he lauded the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and celebrated the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""These are ideas, not acts,"" he said. ""These are expressions, not crimes."" Missing both hands, Al-Masri wears an occasional writing prosthesis on his right forearm rather than the infamous hook-like device he's often seen sporting in photographs. During his testimony, he said colorful stories abound about how he lost the limbs. It happened, he testified, when he worked as an engineer with the Pakistani military during the rebuilding of war-torn Afghanistan, and a bottle-bomb intended for a roadblock project exploded in his hands. Al-Masri, who faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted, will continue his testimony Monday.","Cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri weeps as he describes Srebrenica massacre .

"(CNN) -- In a stunning achievement for unionists and Democrats, critics of the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker marshaled over a million signatures for a petition that has made it possible for Walker to lose his office in a recall election this spring. If so, that would be the first successful gubernatorial recall in Wisconsin history and only the third in that of the United States. Walker blundered last year by pushing through the state legislature a hugely unpopular law that cripples public-sector collective bargaining and thereby suffocates most government unions. Coming on the heels of the November referendum in Ohio, which overturned a similar Republican-sponsored law, it's clear that the American trade union movement is not yet dead. Indeed, the defense of these venerable institutions retains the capacity to put thousands in the streets and mobilize millions of voters, not all of whom are card-carrying unionists by any means. But those hostile to unionism are hardly backing off. In Indiana, where Republicans control the legislature and governor's mansion, they are about to pass a state ""Right-to-Work"" law similar to those anti-union statutes long ago enacted in deep red states as South Carolina and Texas. And in the nation's capital, Republican legislators are on the warpath against the very existence of the National Labor Relations Board, the 75-year-old agency whose Depression-era mandate fosters the capacity of workers to form ""unions of their own choosing."" Why the fuss, when private sector trade unions enroll but one out of every 14 workers and public sector unions have hardly grown in more than 30 years? Meanwhile the strike has practically vanished from the American landscape - there were at least ten times more each year in the 1970s - and the negotiation of a new union contract, in both the public and private sectors, is considered a labor victory if the workers escape without too many givebacks. Political rhetoric during this campaign season fails to capture what's at stake. The Republicans denounce the pensions long ago negotiated by public sector unions as too expensive and they keep up attacks on the contributions of ""Washington union bosses"" to the Democrats. For their part, most Democrats, and this includes President Barack Obama, rarely offer a full-throated defense of the labor movement itself. Instead they frame the Republican anti-union offensive in the Midwestern states largely as an assault on the middle class, as if questions of power and ideology were not at stake. But the fate of unionism is all about class power in American society and the ideologies that motivate those who either defend or defame these institutions. The Occupy Wall Street protests have moved issues of economic inequality closer to the top of the contemporary political agenda, but it's the unions -- in their sometimes plodding and prosaic fashion -- that have long ameliorated the stark disparities of wealth and income that an unfettered capitalism so naturally produces. Tax fairness is a big political issue this campaign season, but of far greater impact on the distribution of American wealth and power is the existence of a union movement and the prospect that it might one day grow again. In the middle decades of the 20th century, when incomes were less unequal -- economists called this the era of the ""great compression"" -- the trade unions were potent, both at the bargaining table and in politics. Conversely, there is much evidence to show that the sharp decline in private sector unionism since the late 1970s is connected to the rising inequality we have today. When they are strong, unions can limit the prerogatives of individual businessmen, government officials and the untamed workings of the labor market. Contemporary free-market conservatives find all this intolerable, which is why governors like Scott Walker and New Jersey's Chris Christie so often seek to demonize the trade unions as corrupt and omnipotent. Fortunately, that rhetoric has found its limit, first in Ohio and now in Wisconsin where more than a million citizens put down their names endorsing the union idea.

"Vatican City (CNN) -- Call him Pope Francis, the pontiff of firsts. When Jorge Bergoglio stepped onto the balcony at the Vatican on Wednesday to reveal himself as the new leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, he made history as the first non-European pope of the modern era, the first from Latin America, the first Jesuit and the first to assume the name Francis. What do you think about the new pope? Tell us. The new pope then quickly made another kind of history, breaking with tradition in his first public act before the 150,000 people packed into St. Peter's Square. Rather than bless the crowd first, he asked them to pray for him. ""Let us say this prayer, your prayer for me, in silence,"" he told the cheering crowd. The willingness by Francis to dispense with tradition was interpreted by a Vatican spokesman as a sign he will be willing to chart his own path in other ways. Pope's name choice 'precedent shattering' ""We have a pope who probably upset some people tonight by not following the formula,"" the Rev. Tom Rosica said. The pontiff also broke with another tradition by refusing to use a platform to elevate himself above the cardinals standing with him as he was introduced to the world as Pope Francis. ""He said I'll stay down here,"" Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York and the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. ""He met each of us on our own level."" Francis, wearing white papal robes, appeared on a rain-soaked night to the throngs shortly after being elected by cardinals in what apparently was the fifth round of voting on the second day of the conclave. ""As you know, the duty of the conclave was to appoint a new Bishop of Rome,"" he said. ""It seems to me that my brother cardinals have chosen one who is from faraway. But here I am. I would like to thank you for your embrace."" As pope, Bergoglio takes the helm of a Catholic Church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy. First Latin American pope 'very exciting' Conservative reformer . The 76-year-old Bergoglio, who served as the archbishop of Buenos Aires, is the first pope to take the name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, revered among Catholics for his work with the poor. St. Francis is viewed as a reformer of the church, answering God's call to ""repair my church in ruins."" The pontiff is considered a straight shooter who calls things as he sees them, and a follower of the church's most social conservative wing. As a cardinal, he clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives. Latin America is home to 480 million Catholics. By choosing Bergoglio, the cardinals sent a strong message about where the future of the church may lie. According to a profile by CNN Vatican analyst John Allen and published by the National Catholic Reporter, Francis was born in Buenos Aires to an Italian immigrant father. 5 things to know about the new pope . He is known for his simplicity. He chose to live in an apartment rather that the archbishop's palace, passed on a chauffeured limousine, took the bus to work and cooked his own meals, Allen wrote. Francis has a reputation for being a voice for the poor. World reacts . Word of the election of Pope Francis, who was not considered a front-runner among analysts, quickly spread around the globe, with everyone from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to U.S. President Barack Obama offering congratulations. ""As the first pope from the Americas, his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day,"" Obama said. World reacts to new pope . Ban said the new pope shares common goals with the United Nations, from the promotion of peace to social justice. ""We also share the conviction that we can only resolve the interconnected challenges of today's world through dialogue,"" he said. Nowhere was the reaction to Bergoglio's selection as pope more surprising than in Latin America. ""I am truly still very surprised ... not just that a Latino pope came out, but that he is an Argentinian from Buenos Aires,"" the Rev. Eduardo Mangiarotti told CNN en Espanol. Calling Benedict . The new pope called his predecessor, Benedict XVI, after he was elected, Rosica said. Francis plans to visit with Benedict on Thursday ahead of an evening Mass with the cardinals in the Sistine Chapel, according to the Vatican . Francis participated in the conclave that elected Benedict in April 2005. He was widely reported to be a runner-up to Benedict in the election. The new pontiff will deliver the traditional Angelus blessing from the Vatican on Sunday, Rosica said. Francis will be formally installed as pope at a Mass on Tuesday, according to the Vatican. What's in a name? Bergoglio's selection of the name of Pope Francis is ""the most stunning"" choice and ""precedent shattering,"" Allen said. ""The new pope is sending a signal that this will not be business as usual."" The name symbolizes ""poverty, humility, simplicity and rebuilding the Catholic Church,"" Allen said. St. Francis of Assisi was born in 1181 or 1182 the son of a rich Italian cloth merchant, according to the Vatican website. After ""a carefree adolescence and youth,"" Francis joined the military and was taken prisoner. He was freed after becoming ill, and when he returned to Assisi, Italy, a spiritual conversion began, and he abandoned his worldly lifestyle. In a famous episode, Christ on the cross came to life three times in the small Church of St. Damian and told him: ""Go, Francis, and repair my Church in ruins,"" Pope Benedict XVI said, according to Vatican's website. CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Hada Messia reported from Vatican City, and Chelsea J. Carter wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Dana Ford, Catherine E. Shoichet, Mariano Castillo and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Pope Francis refused to stand on an elevated platform, a cardinal says .

"(CNN) -- You have a brain with billions of neurons. You have thoughts, and you do things because of those thoughts. But how do tiny cells translate into thoughts and actions? The Brain Activity Map initiative is seeking answers to that question. As described in a proposal published online Thursday in the journal Science Express, a group of prominent researchers is proposing a large-scale effort to create new tools to map the human brain in unprecedented detail. This could lead to treatments for brain disorders such as epilepsy, autism, dementia, depression and schizophrenia, as well as ways to restore movement in paralyzed patients. ""We don't actually understand (how circuits of neurons) generate all these interesting behaviors we have, like speech and language and thoughts and memory,"" said John Donoghue of Brown University's department of neuroscience. ""What we're hoping is that as the tools develop -- and they will continue to develop -- we have additional insights that will lead to better medical devices."" Donoghue and his colleagues are eagerly waiting to see if the federal government will approve new money to pump into the project; the recent spending cuts known as the sequester could affect that prospect. But the scientists' proposal states that the project should be ""funded by a partnership between federal and private organizations,"" and they're already beginning to ramp up their collective efforts, according to George Church, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, who is one of the key minds behind the project. There are already indications of federal interest. President Barack Obama, in his State of the Union address in February, said, ""If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas,"" and alluded to scientists ""mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's."" Along with talking about drug development and materials science, Obama stated, ""Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation."" Fixing and manipulating the brain . A big goal of the initiative is to create ways of stimulating neurons that are less invasive than what's currently available, said Church. There is already research being done on brain implants. Parkinson's disease, for example, is being treated with deep brain stimulators, electrical devices in the brain that restimulate specific circuits of neurons that have become faulty. Donoghue is working on a project called BrainGate2, where scientists are developing technologies to reconnect the brain to the body in patients with paralysis. Researchers implant a small sensor -- about the size of a baby aspirin -- in the motor area of the brain. The sensor picks up a person's thoughts about moving, and transforms brain signals into movement signals. Through this technology, researchers have demonstrated that patients can move a computer cursor by thinking and manipulate a robotic arm as if it were their own. A next step will be to connect to the person's own arm or -- if a person has an amputated limb -- to a prosthetic limb that they could control with thoughts. So far, the movements of the robotic arm don't seem as natural, coordinated or quick as a real arm. That's because scientists do not yet understand the precise brain processes involved. The Brain Activity Map project could help, for instance, look at the neural connections involved in brushing teeth. ""If we truly understand the code of how the brain does that, we could reproduce it,"" Donoghue said. Further into the future, if scientists better understand the neural bases of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, it could be possible to also develop treatments by targeting groups of neurons with electrical impulses. ""If you understood how thinking emerges from the interaction of many neurons, then you would have ideas about what a disordered thought would look like,"" Donoghue said. Another set of tools in the project that looks promising is called optogenetics. Ed Boyden of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is well-known for this technique. It involves using proteins that are sensitive to light, derived from other organisms such as algae, and putting them into neurons. Researchers can then use optic fibers to manipulate those neurons. High-density optical fiber arrays would offer more, and thinner, probes for neuronal exploration than bulky electrodes. ""About a thousand groups are using these right now to study the brain because it lets you turn on one cell, or one kind of cell, and figure out what it does,"" Boyden said. ""Although we don't have a complete list of the parts of the brain, we know that some cells are different than others, and people can turn on and off those cells to figure out how they work."" From worms to humans to cars . The intention of the Brain Activity Map project is to study the human brain, but there is also a lot of work going on in animal models, as they allow opportunities for testing devices before they are deemed safe for human trials. Worms, flies and leeches are good invertebrate candidates, and zebra fish, mice and rats provide another level of depth. ""Within 5 years, it should be possible to monitor and/or to control tens of thousands of neurons, and by year 10 that number will increase at least 10-fold,"" Donoghue and colleagues wrote in the Science article. ""By year 15, observing 1 million neurons with markedly reduced invasiveness should be possible."" Donoghue anticipates that there will be insights that come out of the Brain Activity Map project that go beyond the human brain. After all, as a result of the space program, we have GPS. We have the Web because a primitive version of it was developed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research so that particle physicists could communicate better. How particle smasher and space telescopes relate . In the case of this project, next-generation sensors that work in the brain could also be used to make cars smarter, Donoghue said. For instance, a car could automatically slow down if a soccer ball is detected in the road, anticipating that a child may dart out next. About that money... Researchers compare the economic benefits of brain mapping to the Human Genome Project, which generated $800 billion in economic impact as a result of a $3.8 billion investment, according to the Science Express article. The genome project, for which Church was a key leader, was another one of the ""best ideas"" Obama mentioned in his State of the Union. The Human Genome Project started out in 1990 with $30 million in funding a year, and was ramped up to $300 million a year, Church said. But Church and his colleagues involved in the brain project have a vision that is akin to what happened after that project ended in 2003. Between 2004 and 2011, Church said, there was a ""million-fold"" reduction in the cost of genome sequencing, and it's still happening. ""Every person who does molecular biology now is a million times more effective because of the cost drop that came after the genome project was over,"" he said. Cost reduction of brain mapping is also a big aim of the Brain Activity Map project. As technology gets better, it will also get cheaper, Church said. ""Rather than have some monolithic juggernaut goal, where we're compulsively going to get this neuron and this neuron and this neuron, I think it's more, we want to enable all the creativity, and maybe even jostle the creativity a little bit, because people can dream different dreams,"" he said.","Brain Activity Map project wants to study brain in great detail .
This could lead to treatments for paralysis, Parkinson's and other brain disorders .
Budget cuts may affect funding, but scientists are working with existing resources ."
"Woodland, Washington (CNN) -- Alan Northrop was playing pool in 1993 when his life changed forever. He was lining up a bank shot when he felt something on his wrist: a handcuff. Northrop was arrested for the rape and kidnapping of a housekeeper. ""I instantly said, 'No, you've got the wrong guy,'"" Northrop recalls telling detectives. But detectives believed the victim's testimony, although she was blindfolded for most of the attack. A jury agreed, sentencing Northrop, a father of three children under age 6, to 23 years in prison. From behind bars, Northrop tried to prove police had the wrong guy. In 2000, he contacted the Innocence Project Northwest at the University of Washington School of Law in Seattle. For years, prosecutors denied the project's requests to use more advanced DNA testing on the evidence in Northrop's case. In 2005, a new state law gave judges the power to order additional testing. But it took five more years for Northrop's testing to be completed and for a court to consider the results that conclusively showed another man's DNA was on the victim. In 2010, Northrop, still sitting in prison, got a letter with news he thought he might never get. ""I was jumping around the day room saying, 'I'm out of here! I'm out of here!'"" Northrop said. He walked out of prison a few months later, an experience he could barely describe. It was like every emotion you've ever had, it was so overwhelming, he said. But because he was convicted in Washington, Northrop got little more than that feeling when he was released. Like 23 other states across the country, Washington provides no compensation for those who have been wrongfully convicted. Northrop left prison with less than $2,500, money he had been sent while in prison and wages from his 42-cent-an-hour prison job. Had he been wrongfully convicted in one of the 27 states that do provide compensation, Northrop could have received hundreds of thousands of dollars for his 17 years behind bars. State standards vary . According to an Innocence Project study, Northrop is among the 40% of exonerated prisoners nationwide who received nothing from authorities for their time behind bars. The report calls for all states to pass laws providing the same compensation that the federal government offers for federal crimes: $50,000 per year of wrongful incarceration with an additional $50,000 for each year spent on death row. Today, five states have the same standard. Money would give Northrop a chance to ""just get started over again and have a normal life again,"" he said. He works full-time but lives in a small room in a friend's house because he can't afford his own apartment. Even in the states that do offer compensation to the innocent, standards vary wildly. Some pay $50,000 per year. Two pay more (Texas and Vermont), but others less. Wisconsin pays $5,000 per year while Missouri pays $50 per day. New Hampshire sets an award cap of $20,000 while other states set a maximum of $500,000, $1 million or no limit. Does your state compensate the wrongly convicted? According to the Innocence Project, exonerated prisoners who are eligible for compensation wait an average three years to receive their money. Most states tax the money, according to the Innocence Project Report. Exonerees denied right to benefits . ""There's sort of a gut reaction that this is a horrible injustice,"" said Innocence Project Northwest attorney Lara Zarowsky, who helped free Northrop. She is lobbying for a law in Washington state that would provide not only compensation for exonerated prisoners but also counseling, job training and other benefits that are currently available only to guilty former prisoners, not exonerees like Northrop. Some tasks, like learning new technology or finding transportation, can be difficult for someone who has been out of society for a decade or more. Zarowsky is also pushing for mental and physical health care benefits for exonerees. Washington state agencies ""just say flat out they're not eligible because they weren't actually guilty so they don't qualify, they don't fit our criteria,"" Zarowsky said. Nationwide, 10 states provide social services to help the innocent recover from their time in prison. ""It's not all about the money,"" Northrop said. ""It's about possible counseling for certain individuals. ... People have no idea what effect stress has on a person in there. ... What that does to a mindset is just devastating. Terrible.""","After 17 years behind bars, Alan Northrop released with funds from prison job, gifts .

"(CNN) -- Oberlin College in Ohio suspended classes Monday after a student reported seeing a person resembling a Ku Klux Klan member near the college's Afrikan Heritage House. The sighting of the person wearing a white hood and robe was reported early Monday morning and follows a string of recent hate incidents on Oberlin's campus that have ignited shock and confusion among the student body. ""Since the beginning, there's been anger, frustration, sadness and fear, but we've been working toward a concentrated effort toward change,"" said Eliza Diop, 20, a politics and Africana Studies major who serves on the college student senate and is a resident of the Afrikan Heritage House, which offers programs focused on the African diaspora, according to the college's website. Oberlin College is a small liberal arts college in Oberlin, Ohio, with almost 3,000 students. An emergency meeting among the college's officials was immediately called after the report. In lieu of classes, college administrators asked students, faculty and staff to ""gather for a series of discussions of the challenging issues that have faced our community in recent weeks,"" a statement on Oberlin's website said. ""We hope today will allow the entire community â€” students, faculty, and staff â€”to make a strong statement about the values that we cherish here at Oberlin: inclusion, respect for others, and a strong and abiding faith in the worth of every individual,"" the statement said. The programming included a campuswide teach-in led by Meredith Gadsby, an associate professor and chairwoman of the Africana Studies Department; a collective demonstration of solidarity, including musical performances by campus groups and speeches by campus leaders; and a community convocation entitled ""We Stand Together."" Gadsby has been teaching at Oberlin since 2000 and was notified of the incident at 3 a.m., just hours after the sighting was reported. ""I am worried about the students who have been made to feel incredibly unsafe and still feel targeted,"" Gadsby told CNN Monday. The reported sighting of KKK regalia is the latest in a spate of incidents on Oberlin's campus. According to an incident report provided by the Oberlin Police Department, 15 hate-related events have been reported in the last month alone. Police have not yet been able to substantiate the reports of the alleged KKK regalia sighting. ""We're looking into it and we're trying to talk to other students to see if we can verify the incident,"" said Oberlin Police Sgt. David Jasinski. The other incidents have included several posters containing multiple racial slurs and other derogatory statements targeting various student communities placed around campus. Other reports include various fliers placed around campus containing racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic language and swastika graffiti. ""The frequency of these reports is astounding,"" Gadsby said. ""Over the past four weeks, there has been a concentration of bias incidents in such a short period of time. I have no idea why this happened, no idea who the culprits are, no idea where this is coming from. Students are saying this is not what they came to Oberlin to experience."" Shimon Brand, Hillel director at Oberlin for more than 30 years, noted that these types of incidents were ""exceedingly out of the ordinary"" but that students have worked together to address the incident. ""Instead of students acting as victims, they reacted through understanding and engagement. There's a real sense of sadness and anger, but solidarity that there's work to be done,"" he said. Chris Landers, 21, an English major and co-editor-in-chief of the college's newspaper, the Oberlin Review, said the paper has welcomed letters to the editor and has asked people to contact the staff with any incident reports to encourage dialogue from all groups on campus. ""We value every member of Oberlin. We know we're not the perfect place, but we strive to be an inclusive place. We want Oberlin to be a place where every member of every community feels valued and feels that they have a legitimate voice,"" he said. These incidents are being investigated by both Oberlin College security and the Oberlin Police Department. Scott Wargo, director of media relations for the college, said, ""No official disciplinary action has been taken."" No official charges have been filed. But Jasinski said that two students had been removed. ""It's an ongoing investigation. At this time, college security caught a couple of students. Two students have been removed from campus,"" Jasinski said. Vicki Anderson, special agent for the FBI's Cleveland Division, said, ""We have been made aware of the incidents and we have been in contact with the Oberlin Police Department and will continue to assess the situation accordingly."" Gadsby still feels that Oberlin can be a model for other campuses that have dealt with hate-related incidents. She hopes students will continue to mobilize and share information with law enforcement. ""It's good to be made uncomfortable; it strengthens our resolve,"" she said. ""These incidents don't just happen at small liberal arts colleges. These moments are important for students to engage in the theories that we teach and put them into practice."" For students, it's a reminder that they need to remain vigilant in their fight against hate on their campus. ""Racism is still here. It may not be as visible as it was 50 years ago, but it's still visible. We still need to fight it, even in 2013,"" Diop said. ""I want us to remember that hate is unproductive. Love reigns supreme.""","A reported Ku Klux Klan sighting at Oberlin College prompts cancellation of classes .

"Washington (CNN) -- For years, Jeff Ragsdale was in and out of jail, high on drugs and alcohol, and homeless. ""I've had so many chances, but this time it's really working out. I'm a little more focused than I was in the past,"" he said. This weekend, he was part of a team of chefs from DC Central Kitchen who are busy boiling 6,000 eggs for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. After many failed attempts to get clean and hold a steady job, Ragsdale applied to DC Central Kitchen's Culinary Job Training program. He's one of hundreds of chefs who have graduated from the program, which is geared toward helping formerly incarcerated and homeless adults get back on their feet. ""It makes you feel good to know that you're a part of an organization that does so many good things for the community and to be recognized by the White House, you know it doesn't get much better than that. It makes me feel good that I can be a part of something of this magnitude."" This is third year that students and graduates of DC Central Kitchen's job training program have helped to prepare the White House Easter Egg Roll, which is hosted by President Obama and the first lady. The kitchen serves about 5,000 meals a day, 365 days a year to those in need in the DC area. But the 16-week job training program has been at its core for nearly 20 years, spokesman Bryan MacNair said. Graduates of the program, which boasted an 80% job placement rate in 2009, move on to work at restaurants, hotels and convention centers. The program equips students with culinary and sanitation skills, but ""really, 40 or 50 percent are life skills,"" MacNair said. ""There's a camaraderie, a community of men and women working next to each other and really feeling that their lives are changing,"" he said ""Men and women come here and leave as different people."" Dwain Arrington is another chef who is thriving in the program. It's the first job he has held after spending 12 years in prison for weapons possession. Here, he feels like people understand him, and he takes pride in their collective accomplishments. ""A lot of folks went through my similar situation and perhaps worse. They told me their stories and how they overcame their adversity. I just stuck with it. They saw something in me that I didn't see. They offered me the position and I stuck with it, grew like a family, things worked out good,"" he said. Ragsdale says the best feeling for him is to give back to a community he took so much from in troubled times. ""This organization is different because it works on giving back to the community, and it largely works with those of us who in the past have taken so much from the community, so just to be able to give back is a blessing.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Debates are a campaign's restart button. Voters try to erase their preconceptions and examine the candidates face-to-face, equal and unscripted -- which is why a challenger, particularly one who's running behind, is eager to have as many debates as possible. Voters said John Kerry won the debates in 2004 but they liked George W. Bush better and he won a second term. ""Let's meet every week from now until the election and talk about the real issues facing Americans.'' That was John Kerry to U.S. President George W. Bush in August 2004. Republican John McCain issued the same challenge to Democratic Barack Obama this summer, when Obama was the frontrunner in the polls. This year there's three debates between the presidential candidates -- September 26 in Mississippi; October 7 in Tennessee and October 15 in New York state. Debates are valuable because they provide most of the spontaneous moments in the campaign. Everything else is staged -- the rallies, the television ads, the conventions. But debates, which are organized by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, are unscripted. The candidates do not know the questions in advance. How do they prepare? Debate coaches grill them. They ask them tough questions on every subject likely to come up. They even coach the candidates on ""body language,'' such as how to invade an opponent's space in order to appear dominant.  Watch a preview of the upcoming presidential debate » . In every election since 1952 -- until this year -- either the president has run for re-election (like George W. Bush in 2004) or the vice president has run to succeed him (like Al Gore in 2000). Debates give the challenger a chance to close the stature gap with the president or the vice president. And to make the election a referendum on the incumbent president. In 1960, John F. Kennedy, who was challenging Vice President Richard Nixon, played to concerns that the U.S. was losing its competitive edge against the Soviet Union. ""Are our strength and prestige rising?"" Kennedy asked in a debate. ""Do people want to be identified with us?"" The 1980 race was very much in doubt when challenger Ronald Reagan went into his one and only debate with President Jimmy Carter one week before Election Day. Reagan's hard-line image frightened many voters. He used the debate to reassure them that he wasn't a dangerous man. And to frame the election as a referendum on his opponent. ""Ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?'' Reagan said in his closing statement. ""Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?'' Debates often provide revealing moments. Like when President Gerald Ford prematurely liberated Eastern Europe at a 1976 debate. ""The United States does not concede that these countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union,'' the president said, making specific reference to Poland, Yugoslavia and Romania. In 1988, Michael Dukakis gave a dispassionate response when asked whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. ""I've opposed the death penalty all of my life,'' Dukakis replied. ""I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent.'' In 1992, the first President Bush was criticized for being out of touch with ordinary Americans. That perception was reinforced during a debate when the camera caught the president looking at his watch as he took questions from voters. One voter asked about the consequences of the national debt. ""I'm not sure I get it,'' President Bush responded. The challenger got it. ""Tell me how [the debt] has affected you?'' Bill Clinton responded. ""Do you know people who have lost their jobs and lost their homes?'' In 2000, Al Gore may have won more debating points. But the camera caught Gore theatrically sighing while George W. Bush answered questions. Voters liked Bush better. And that's what counted. Similarly in 2004, when CNN polled viewers after each debate, the prevailing view was that Kerry won. Voters concluded Kerry was a better debater than Bush. But that didn't get Kerry many votes. Voters decide how to vote based on many qualities, not just debating skills. The prize for winning a debate is not winning the election. What debates really do is keep the race open. Many voters say: ""I'm going to hit the restart button, clear the screen and watch the debates with an open mind. Then I'll decide how to vote.''","Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama are having three debates .
Debates provide spontaneous moments and often provide revealing moments .
They give voters the chance to examine the candidates face-to-face and equal .
But winning the debate does not necessarily mean winning the White House ."
"(CNN) -- Glass Onion Catering has recalled more than 180,000 pounds of ready-to-eat salads and sandwich wrap products with fully cooked chicken and ham that may be contaminated with E. coli, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The Richmond, California, company products, which were shipped to distribution centers in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington, may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, according to the USDA. They were produced between September 23 and November 6, and have ""P-34221"" inside the USDA inspection mark. E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2-8 days after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old and older adults. At least 26 people have been sickened in three states by E. coli O157:H7 in recent weeks. Of those, 15 ate products included in the recall.

"(CNN) -- In the black market of prison life, cell phones have become perhaps the hottest commodity. Now, Texas is among a growing number of state governments going after them. Hundreds of contraband cell phones were found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008. Tiny, easy to hide and an unmonitored link for convicts to the outside world, cell phones are valuable contraband, fetching a greater asking price from convicts than some shipments of illegal drugs. John Moriarty, inspector general for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said that one phone can fetch as much as $2,000. ""It takes one crooked prison worker to populate a whole prison unit with them,"" he said. More than 1,200 wireless phones sit in law enforcement evidence rooms, all found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008. Moriarty is the investigator and bloodhound the state of Texas uses to trail the illegal traffic. ""These are not stupid people,"" he said of the coordinated efforts to slip phones into the prison and hide them. ""There are a lot of hands in between and they all want a piece of the action."" Accomplices on the outside vary from family members, to friends to fellow criminals who buy or steal the phones and charge them with minutes. The contraband is then moved through an elaborate series of drop points and usually ferried into the walls of a prison by a guard or trustee -- an escape engineered in reverse. Finding the dirty prison employee is often the key. ""Some of these guys make next to nothing, so you can see how easy it could be to corrupt them,"" Moriarty said. State Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and the chair of the state senate's Criminal Justice Committee, became an ally of Moriarty's after one phone call in October. He picked up a phone slip from his secretary and called the number on it -- only to realize he had returned a call to a death row inmate's cell phone. The inmate, he said, was Richard Tabler -- a convicted double murderer who was sharing a wireless phone with nine other inmates. ""At first I thought it was a hoax,"" said Whitmire, who said he called the state justice board and ""read them the riot act."" Whitmire is one of the sponsors of a bill in the Texas Legislature that would crack down on convicts caught with phones and allow prison systems to monitor and detect cell signals. It's en route to Gov. Rick Perry's desk after clearing both houses of the legislature this week. Other efforts are under way at both the state and federal level. In January, U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, introduced legislation that would let prisons jam cell-phone signals within their walls. Last month, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley asked the federal government for permission to do so in his state. Prison officials in Arizona are training dogs to sniff out cell phones.","Texas is among a growing number of states going after contraband cell phones .

"(CNN) -- Cyprus, the tiny Mediterranean island bailed out a year ago, remains ""in difficulty...but not as bad as one would have expected,"" its finance minister Harris Georgiades told CNN during an interview in the capital city Nicosia. The country, which was given a 10 billion euro ($13.7 billion) injection by the European Union and IMF ago after its banking system collapsed, was the smallest of the euro economies to get help during the bloc's financial crisis. Unlike the Greek economy which has seen more than a quarter of its GDP wiped out during the past five years, the finance minister said that Cyprus will lose about half that. The European Commission is now forecasting growth in 2015 after a steep contraction of 4.8% this year and 6% percent last year. According to Georgiades, the situation is ""bad and I have never tried to paint a rosy picture."" The country has been ""dealing with shortcomings and there were significant shortcomings, we have to admit."" Cypriot banks were big buyers of Greek bonds during the pre-crisis boom, before the 2004 Athens Olympics and until the bottom fell out of economy in 2008. Cyprus, crippled by losses on Greek debt, set a precedent in the euro crisis by imposing losses on bank depositors. It was a move which infuriated savers, worried investors and pushed the euro crisis back into the headlines. But Georgiades said the country's main mistake was letting the crisis escalate. ""We should have seen action both on behalf of the Cypriot authorities and the EU two years ago,"" he said. One of the key challenges during the rebuilding effort is dealing with an estimated $40 billion of non-performing loans which are holding back fresh lending. When asked if a ""bad bank"" could be set up to absorb those loans, Georgiades said the banking sector and supervisory authorities ""need to work in a coordinated effort to deal with this problem,"" but added, ""I would say that all the possibilities should be left on the table."" Meanwhile, Cyprus' relationship with Russia is under pressure as the West increases economic pressure on Vladimir Putin's government and his allies. Relations with the West fractured after Russia's military intervention in Crimea and its amassing of troops on Ukraine's border. Russians are strategic investors in Cyprus, and wealthy individuals have long been drawn to the island and its low tax rates. A total of $30 billion has been invested by Russian companies over the past two decades, according to the Russian statistical agency ROSSTAT, putting Cyprus just behind the Netherlands as the top EU recipients. Georgiades said Cyprus -- along with its EU partners -- was supporting a ""clear coherent common stance"" and was not pushing toward a ""new cold war."" The country's stance is based on principles of ""sovereign and human rights,"" Georgiades said. ""We believe these principles are best served with well thought cool headed action and reaction and not a rushed move into a cold war mentality,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United finally lost patience with manager David Moyes Tuesday after a disastrous first season in charge of the English Premier League champions. ""Manchester United announces that David Moyes has left the club,"" said the English Premier League team in a statement on the club's official Twitter feed. ""The club would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work, honesty and integrity he brought to the role."" Moyes succeeded Alex Ferguson last May but has overseen a lackluster campaign, with the club lying seventh in the table having amassed 57 points from 34 games. United slipped to an 11th league defeat this season against the Scot's former club Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday -- a result that finally ended any mathematical chance of participating in next season's Champions League. The three-time winner of the European club football's biggest prize is now 13 points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with four games remaining. The last time United failed to qualify was in 1995 and their chances of even playing in the Europa League next season are slim. ""The football and the results have been poor,"" former Manchester United defender Gary Neville told Sky Sports News. ""The performances have got worse and worse."" Soon after Moyes' departure was confirmed, United appointed current player-coach Ryan Giggs as caretaker manager. ""Ryan Giggs, the club's most decorated player, will assume responsibility for the first team until a permanent appointment can be made,"" said United in a statement. ""The club will make no further comment on this process until it is concluded."" Moyes, who turns 51 on Friday, signed a six-year-deal with English football's most successful club last May, when the outgoing Ferguson personally endorsed his appointment. ""David is a man of great integrity with a strong work ethic ... There is no question he has all the qualities we expect of a manager at this club,"" Ferguson said of his compatriot. Ferguson also implored United fans to stand by Moyes when he addressed them following his last game in charge at Old Trafford last season, which ended with his 13th league title in a trophy-laden 27-year reign. But United's owners, the American Glazer family, have clearly had second thoughts following a persistently stuttering campaign -- which has led to the club falling down football's rich list. In January it was reported that United's share price had fallen 16% since Moyes took over, while Deloitte's annual football money table placed the Old Trafford team outside of the world's top three richest clubs for the first time in 17 years. Moyes opened his account with a 2-0 win against Wigan in the FA Charity Shield match at Wembley in August and followed it with a convincing 4-1 win at Swansea in the opening game of the league season. But pressure soon started piling up in September with league defeats against arch rivals Liverpool, Manchester City and, embarrassingly, West Bromwich Albion at Old Trafford -- the Midlands' club first win at the ""Theater of Dreams"" for 34 years. United also endured embarrassing exits from both domestic knockout competitions, losing at home to Swansea in the third round of the FA Cup and going down on penalties against another struggling Premier League team -- Sunderland -- in the League Cup semifinals. Hopes of Champions League glory were ended by Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals earlier this month, with the reigning European champion winning 4-2 on aggregate. Netherlands Louis van Gaal has been installed as the favorite to succeed Moyes on a permanent basis by British bookmaker . Current player-coach Ryan Giggs and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt are reportedly set to be placed in caretaker charge for Saturday's home game with Norwich City.","David Moyes is dismissed after less than a year in charge of English league titleholder .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel is denying Palestinians access to adequate water supplies by controlling shared water resources, the human rights group Amnesty International said in a report released Tuesday. In the 100-page report, titled ""Troubled Waters: Palestinians Denied Fair Access to Water,"" Amnesty says Israel restricts Palestinian access to water through various means while making it readily available to its own citizens. The group accuses Israel of ignoring humanitarian and human rights laws, in violation of its obligations as the occupying power. The report says water from the shared Israeli-Palestinian mountain aquifer is inequitably distributed, with Israel using more than 80 percent of it. The aquifer is the sole source of water for the approximately 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank. The Israeli military has denied Palestinians access to Palestinian lands where water from the Jordan River could be accessed, the head of the Palestinian water authority told CNN. ""Since (1967) the Israeli authorities did not allow us to drill in the Western Aquifer, which is the most important shared aquifer in the West Bank,"" Dr. Shaddad Attili said. Amnesty argues that Israel also limits access to water supplies by placing restrictions on the movement of people and goods, and by enacting ""a complex system of permits which Palestinians must obtain from the Israeli army and other authorities in order to carry out water related projects"" which effectively prevent the creation of needed water and sanitation projects. The Israeli government rejects many of the conclusions of the Amnesty report. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, called the idea that Israel was taking water away from the Palestinians ""simply false."" He said that Israeli consumption of water from the mountain aquifer had gone down in absolute terms from 1967 to today, despite the fact that Israel's population had more than doubled in that time to its current level of approximately 7 million people. A statement from the Israeli Foreign Ministry charges that the authors of the Amnesty International report ""chose to ignore Israeli data, papers and reports, although they contain verifiable facts presented with total transparency."" ""Israel has fulfilled all its obligations under the water agreement regarding the supply of additional quantities of water to the Palestinians, and has even extensively surpassed the obligatory quantity,"" the foreign ministry statement said. ""The Palestinians, on the other hand, have significantly violated their commitments under the water agreement, specifically regarding important issues such as illegal drilling (they have drilled over 250 wells without the authorization of the Joint Water Commission) and handling of sewage (The Palestinians are not constructing sewage treatment plants, despite their obligation to do so and the important foreign funding earmarked for this purpose),"" the statement added. Amnesty's report notes the stark discrepancy in water use between Israelis and Palestinians, claiming that water consumption per capita for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza is about 70 liters (about 18 gallons) per day, while Israeli per capita use is 300 liters (79 gallons) per day. In an interview with CNN, Amnesty researcher Donatella Rovera said a drive through the Palestinian West Bank shows the striking disparity in water use, with ""Israeli settlements with vast, green, well-irrigated farms and swimming pools and right next to them, Palestinian villages which are absolutely parched."" In Gaza, which is home to approximately 1.5 million Palestinians, Rovera said the water situation has reached a ""crisis point."" She said water from the coastal aquifer, which supplies most of Gaza, is 90 percent to 95 percent polluted and unfit for human consumption. Rovera said immediate and long-term solutions were not workable under the current Israeli and Egyptian blockade of Gaza, which is meant to isolate the Hamas movement, which took over Gaza in 2007. Gaza's water system, which was in a state of decay when Hamas took power, was further damaged in the three-week war between Israel and Hamas in January. Regev argued that Israel has provided more water to the Palestinian Authority than it is obligated to under the Oslo accords and that more than a third of the water transferred from Israel to the West Bank was lost to theft and lack of infrastructure maintenance by Palestinians. Watch what happened to Gaza water infrastructure in war . He said the Palestinians have received ""billions in aid"" over the past decade and a half and invested little in their water systems, and termed ""ridiculous"" the notion that the mountain aquifer was only for Palestinian use. ""Israel has every right to take water from that source,"" Regev said of the mountain aquifer. The Palestinian Authority was quick to seize on the findings of the Amnesty report in a statement released Tuesday. ""What is emerging today is a growing consensus over how the discriminatory water laws and practices Israel employs to deny Palestinians access to clean and adequate water supplies are emblematic of what amounts to a system of apartheid that underpins the entire structure of Israel's illegal settlement enterprise in the West Bank, and collective punishment in the Gaza Strip,"" said Palestinian water authority chief Attili. Amnesty's report made no conclusions about what amount or percentage of water should be made available to the Palestinians, but called on Israel to allow Palestinians ""to access and extract an equitable share of water from the shared aquifers and surface water resources in the West Bank and Gaza.""","Palestinians denied same water access as Israelis, Amnesty International says .

"(CNN) -- Thirteen Galveston, Texas, police officers have been disciplined in connection with a brawl last year between officers and wedding guests. Houston Astros pitcher Brandon Backe was among the wedding guests arrested in the brawl. The fracas led to the arrest of 13 people, including Houston Astros pitcher Brandon Backe. Nine officers will be suspended, with the lengths of time ranging from two to seven days, and four will receive written reprimands in connection with the October 5 disturbance. The disciplinary actions stem from the violation of Galveston police administrative procedures, which stymied investigators trying to determine whether rules about the use of force had been violated. In the end, police said, the officers heeded the department's rules on the use of force but not on recording details of what happened. The incident centered around the drunk and disorderly behavior of Daniel Cole O'Balle, 19, who had been attending his sister's wedding at a convention center, police said. During the wedding reception, O'Balle became inebriated and at the end of the reception, ""instigated a confrontation"" with a security guard when he tried to take beer from the center, police said. The guard later spotted O'Balle with a beer at the San Luis Hotel bar H2O and called police, authorities said. O'Balle ""was, in violation of Texas law, permitted to consume alcoholic beverages to the point of becoming highly intoxicated,"" police said. O'Balle's attempts to take beer from the convention center was also in violation of the law, authorities said. ""This comprehensive review has revealed that this incident, and the resulting arrests, was instigated by the actions of a single individual. This individual exercised extremely poor judgment and, if he had been properly supervised by his parents and not allowed to violate the law, this incident likely could have been avoided in its entirety,"" police said in a news release announcing the disciplinary action. Under Texas law, a minor can consume alcohol ""if they are in the visible presence of, and have the consent of their adult parent, legal guardian or spouse."" Police said O'Balle became ""belligerent"" when an officer confronted him and that he became ""aggressive toward and noncompliant with"" the officer. More officers showed up and others with the wedding party interfered to keep officers from arresting O'Balle, who threw punches at the officers, police said. About 30 police officers responded, and a large crowd eventually gathered. CNN affiliate KHOU-TV in Houston said police used pepper spray and electrical shock Tasers to detain and arrest 13 people, including Backe. KHOU said Backe was charged with interfering with a police officer. A mug shot of the Astros pitcher shows bruises on his face. Police gave the following account of what happened, based on an internal investigation: . ""When Lt. Joel Caldwell arrived, he determined that the crowd was so out of control that it was necessary to clear the bar to re-establish order. Accordingly, Lt. Caldwell ordered a tactical crowd control line was formed to clear the bar. ""As officers instructed people to leave the bar, more individuals, some of whom were intoxicated, became belligerent and refused to leave when asked to do so,"" the account continued. ""Those individuals who refused to leave peaceably or were otherwise disorderly, and those who appeared to officers to be intoxicated, were taken into custody for their violations."" KHOU said police charged O'Balle with three counts of assault on a public servant and one charge of retaliation. Police said arrests were ""based on probable cause"" and that any force they used was a proper reaction to confront ""resistance or interference."" ""No officer was found to have violated any departmental policies related to any arrest or any use of force,"" police said. The disciplinary actions are the result of an internal investigation in which 70 witnesses, suspects and officers were interviewed, documentation was examined and video was produced. Police investigators said ""insufficient and inadequate reporting"" by officers complicated their review of the case. There were failures by some officers and supervisors ""to properly file affidavits, supplemental reports, booking reports, use of force reports and arrest warrants."" The 13 disciplined officers also will be getting remedial training in documentation and reporting. ""The investigators also determined that these paperwork failures, all of which occurred after the incident and related arrests, did not cause or contribute to the events in question or lead to any improper conduct by any officer in their responses to the situation presented by O'Balle and the others who were arrested,"" according to police. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","Nine police officers face suspension for response to wedding brawl .

"(CNN) -- At least one member of the jury that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death in the arson homicides of his three children says she is struggling with the idea that she might have convicted an innocent man. A family photo shows Cameron Todd Willingham with his wife, Stacy, and daughters Kameron, Amber and Karmon. It has been 17 years since Willingham was convicted in Texas of setting a house fire that killed his children, a crime Willingham vehemently denied right up until his execution in 2004. Since that time, three investigations have concluded arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire, including one that arrived in Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office 88 minutes before the scheduled execution. Perry replaced four of nine members of the Texas Forensics Sciences Commission in recent weeks, just before the commission was to receive a report from the latest of the three investigations. The controversy has led juror Dorenda Brokofsky to think twice about the decision she made in a jury room in 1992. ""I don't sleep at night because of a lot of this,"" Brokofsky said. ""I have gone back and forth in my mind trying to think of anything that we missed. I don't like the fact that years later someone is saying maybe we made a mistake, that the facts aren't what they could've been."" Brokofsky spoke with CNN by phone from her Midwest home. She has long since moved away from tiny Corsicana, Texas, where the fire took place. ""I do have doubts now,"" she said. ""I mean, we can only go with what we knew at the time, but I don't like the fact now that maybe this man was executed by our word because of evidence that is not true. It may not be true now. And I don't like the fact that I may have to face my God and explain what I did."" ""When you're sitting there with all those facts, there was nothing else we could see,"" she said. ""Now I don't know. I can't tell you he's innocent, I can't say 100 percent he's guilty."" Brokofsky had another revelation. She said she thought she would be excluded from the jury because of her family's close relationship with key witness and then-Corsicana Assistant Fire Chief Douglas Fogg. Her father was also a fire marshal for eight years before the Willingham fire. ""I was raised with my father being a fire marshal,"" she said. ""He went around proving that stuff, so he wasn't here at that time. But I knew Doug Fogg, who was one of the witnesses. It was no secret, but I didn't think they would pick me as a juror because of it."" Critics say Perry's recent actions to shake up the commission were politically motivated, a charge he denies. Perry's office said it received a five-page fax on the day of the execution that contained an arson expert's findings that the fire was not deliberately set. It is unclear whether Perry read the fax. ""Given the brevity of the report and the general counsel's familiarity with all the other facts in the case, there was ample time for the general counsel to read and analyze the report and to brief the governor on its contents,"" Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle said. Willingham was executed less than two hours later. Death-penalty opponents say an impartial review of Willingham's case could lead to an unprecedented admission -- that the state executed an innocent man. The latest report concluded that the arson ruling at the heart of Willingham's conviction ""could not be sustained"" by modern science or the standards of the time. Perry said he remains confident Willingham was guilty, as do authorities in Corsicana, south of Dallas, who prosecuted Willingham. Willingham's wife's brother, Ronnie Kuykendall, said in a signed affidavit that Stacy Willingham told her family that Todd Willingham confessed to killing the children during her visit to him on death row a few days before the execution. But Stacy Willingham testified for her husband during his trial, while her family argued he was guilty. CNN could not reach her for comment. Even Willingham's defense attorney, David Martin, remains confident his client committed the crime. ""There was no question whatsoever that he was guilty,"" Martin said on CNN's ""AC360"" Thursday night.  Watch defense attorney say client was guilty » . Martin slammed the most recent report on the Willing ham case, by Maryland arson expert Craig Beyler, as ""one of the least objective reports I've ever read.""

"Editor's note: Douglas W. Blayney, MD, is president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. He specializes in the treatment of breast cancer and lymphoma and was in private practice for 17 years in California. Brenda Nevidjon, RN, is president of the Oncology Nursing Society and clinical professor of nursing at Duke University School of Nursing. She was the first nurse and first woman to be chief operating officer of Duke University Hospital. Douglas Blayney says a health care bill provision on end-of-life care has been completely misconstrued. (CNN) -- The heated national debate on health care reform has taken an unusual turn, with many eyes focused on a minor provision regarding end-of-life care embedded in the House bill. The measure provides coverage for Medicare beneficiaries who elect to meet with their medical team once every five years to discuss options for treatment if they become seriously ill. It's called end-of-life care or advance care planning. Some opponents of the House bill have expended great energy and resources in recent weeks to convince seniors that this provision will somehow result in government-sponsored euthanasia. We have seen the volatile response to these allegations at town hall meetings across the country. This argument is completely false. This provision simply provides for Medicare to pay for voluntary conversations between patients and their health care practitioners on the difficult but important subject of planning for care at the end of life. The provision is purely optional, and patients would be able to choose whether to discuss the issue with their practitioners. For those who decide to do so, there would be clear benefits. These discussions can include where a person wants to receive care and how physical needs, including pain, are to be managed. The merits of broader health care reform legislation aside, there should be no controversy about the benefits of end-of-life care planning discussions. According to a 2008 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, these discussions have been proven to improve patient care and quality of life. Confronting the prospect of death isn't easy for anyone. So perhaps it's no surprise that few people talk with their doctors, nurses or loved ones about their wishes for end-of-life care. Surveys show that only 13 percent of Americans have established a living will laying out their desires for treatment near death, and shared it with their medical teams. We discuss end-of-life care with patients to fulfill our commitment to them throughout the course of their care. When a disease cannot be cured, we can assure our patients that we can make them comfortable in their last days. When these conversations are done in advance and done well, everyone benefits -- patients, families and all members of our care teams. As practitioners, we know from experience that discussions with patients in the end stages of their cancers and with their family members may be long and emotional, but ultimately lead to end-of-life care centered on the patient's wishes. We have seen many patients who were well-cared-for by their families, with professional help, and were comfortable in their surroundings. We know, through research and through our own experience, that patients who have discussed end-of-life care make better-informed treatment decisions, experience less pain and depression, and fare better overall. iReport.com: Share your hopes for health care reform . At some point, we all will need to make decisions about care at the end of life. Whether ill or not, every American should think ahead about the kind of treatment they want, discuss their desires with their loved ones and their doctors and nurses, and develop living wills to document their wishes. A new Medicare benefit that acknowledges the value of end-of-life conversations between health care practitioners and patients is long overdue and should be included in any health care reform bill. It is good medicine and improves the lives of patients -- exactly what policymakers say they are looking for in health care reform. More importantly, it would help all Americans live their final days with dignity and in accord with their own wishes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas W.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Violence across Iraq has claimed nine lives in the past two days, officials with the nation's interior ministry said Monday. Gunmen killed Arkan Yaqoub, a Christian citizen, who was shot dead along with his driver by gunmen as they were driving in central Mosul on Monday morning, said ministry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns and because they are not authorized to talk to the media. Yaqoub was the deputy director of the state cement factory in Mosul. The motive behind his killing was unknown, but many Iraqi Christians have been targeted since 2004 by Sunni extremist groups, prompting many to flee the country. In Saqlawaiya, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of Falluja, two civilians were shot to death by gunmen Monday morning. The two were driving in a car when gunmen intercepted the vehicle on a highway, the officials said. The motive was unknown. In northeastern Baghdad's al-Shaab neighborhood, a roadside bomb exploded near a minibus Monday, killing one civilian and wounding five others, the officials said. Elsewhere, a police officer at al-Kadhimiya civic court died when a bomb attached to his car exploded in the Saba al-Boor district of northern Baghdad. On Sunday, an Iraqi servicemember and a firefighter died when they responded to the scene of a roadside bombing. The bombing targeted a liquor store in the Abu Ghraib area of western Baghdad and set the building ablaze. When the servicemember and firefighter responded, another roadside bomb exploded. Six people were wounded. There have been at least 20 such bombings at liquor stores across Baghdad since the beginning of March, when the Iraqi government decided to reopen liquor stores and bars in the capital city. They had been closed for four months. The interior ministry officials said Sunni and Shiite extremists are believed to be behind the attacks. In the al-Taji district in Baghdad's northern outskirts, an Iraqi police officer was shot by gunmen while driving in a car Sunday afternoon, the officials said. Atheel al-Nujaifi, Mosul's governor, escaped a roadside bombing unharmed Monday morning. He was driving to Baghdad in a convoy consisting of six vehicles when a roadside bomb exploded at one of the vehicles. One of al-Nujaifi's bodyguards was wounded, the interior ministry officials said. The incident occurred about 110 kilometers (68 miles) south of Mosul. Others were wounded in attacks, interior ministry officials said. Five civilians were wounded in a roadside bombing in eastern Baghdad on Monday, and two employees of a security company were wounded in another roadside bombing in southeastern Baghdad. On Sunday, a police lieutenant was wounded when a bomb attached to his car exploded. Overall, violence in Iraq is down considerably from its peak between 205 and 2007. However, assassinations, gunfire and bombs remain regular occurrences.","A Christian citizen was shot dead along with his driver .

"(CNN) -- Living near Wrigley Field has always felt magical to diehard Chicago Cubs fan Deb Gordils, who was born and raised in Wrigleyville, just blocks away from the famed ballpark. The 53-year-old said her life has been intertwined with the ballpark. She spent most of her youth daydreaming that she'd become the next shortstop for the Chicago Cubs, and she was devastated when she was told she couldn't play Little League baseball because she was a girl. But that didn't lessen her undying love for the Friendly Confines. ""I remember racing to the park after school to catch the last part of a game,"" Gordils said. When she was much younger, she would watch some of those games from a friend's apartment window that had a view of the field. Similar apartments still exist today. Gordils is one of many Chicagoans, baseball fans and historians who shared their memories and photos of the renowned ballpark with CNN iReport in honor of Wrigley Field turning 100 years old on April 23. The second oldest major league ballpark, Wrigley Field has become a cultural and historical institution in the Windy City since its opening in 1914. From its outfield walls covered in ivy -- which was planted in the 1930s and has occasionally thwarted outfielders in their quest for the ball -- to its manual scoreboard, which no batted ball has ever hit, Wrigley Field retains much of its original charm. 25 years on the 'dead stadium' tour . In an age when newer baseball stadiums are the norm, what's the secret to Wrigley's longevity? Gary Gillette, co-chair of the Society for American Baseball Research ballparks committee and a baseball writer, said the ballpark's assimilation into the community is part of the secret. He said it's the same for Boston's Fenway Park, which celebrated 100 years in 2012. ""There's a reason the neighborhood around Wrigley Field is called Wrigleyville. Wrigley Field is integrated into the neighborhood,"" he said. One of the park's features that he attributes to its neighborliness is its lack of parking spaces. That's right, no cars. ""Wrigley and Fenway, they're very tight knit. There's very little parking, most people take mass transit or walk and that helps preserve them,"" he said. Loving Chicago, despite it all . The Cubs' lack of success may have actually helped preserve the park as well, said Wrigley expert Stuart Shea. ""After World War II, the Cubs were a bad team for 20 years. And they didn't have a lot of attendance during that time,"" said Shea, who recently published an updated version of his book, ""Wrigley Field: The Long Life and Contentious Times of the Friendly Confines."" ""The fact that the Cubs weren't that good means there wasn't pressure to move somewhere modern or bigger."" Howard Katz, a Boston-based psychologist said going to a ballpark evokes feelings of camaraderie, which can also explain why Wrigley Field has lasted. ""I think that gathering with large groups of people in spaces where we celebrate something larger than ourselves is very meaningful for us. There is a kind of admiration for being all we can be in terms of human achievement."" That communal experience transcends generations. Herschel Pollard said he felt like he had ""traveled through time"" when he visited Wrigley in 2012 to see the Cubs play the Astros. 15 of nature's most spectacular shows . ""I loved knowing I was seeing the same sights, smelling the same smells, hearing the same sounds as every person who's attended a game at Wrigley over the last 100 years,"" he said. ""Wrigley fulfilled every ballpark fantasy I had as a kid. This is how baseball should be seen."" At 100 years old, how much longer does it have left? According to Shea, another 30 to 40 years before it will need some major upgrades. ""The one thing I worry about is that if new scoreboards were added, then that will reduce the city view, and you will lose the feel that makes it special. That open view of the city is the one of the most important parts of the park,"" he said. It adds to a sense of community that Gordils, now mother of two girls, said makes Wrigley Field irreplaceable. ""I was born and raised around the ballpark. I attended school blocks away from the ballpark, and today my kids go to school blocks from the ballpark and my office is near Wrigley,"" she said. ""It was really magical living around Wrigley field. It was -- and is -- always home."" 10 things you don't know about 100 years of Wrigley .

"(CNN) -- A bear believed to be involved in this week's attack on a 54-year-old Florida woman has been caught and euthanized, a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokeswoman said Thursday. The trapped bear closely fits the description of the animal involved in the attack, according to a statement from the commission. The 200-pound female bear was caught by commission biologists in the Longwood neighborhood where Susan Chalfant was mauled Monday night. Because the bear was caught within 48 hours in the vicinity of the attack, the decision was made to euthanize her. A female yearling bear was trapped Tuesday night, but it did not fit the description of the bear involved in the incident. Chalfant, who was walking her dogs at the time of the attack, was hospitalized for her injuries. As of Tuesday, the hospital declined to provide updates on Chalfant's condition. The woman's face was severely injured, according to a neighbor who told a 911 dispatcher she was ""so bloodied"" that the neighbor couldn't determine her age. Neighbors in Longwood, north of Orlando, say bears often roam through the area, especially when looking for food thrown out by humans. ""There's an actual walkway of the bears between my home and the immediate neighbor,"" said one resident, who identified himself only as Richard. ""We see them on a regular basis, especially the nights before garbage pickups."" Wildlife officials say that if homeowners aren't careful with their trash, the bears will keep showing up. ""Unless we get the full cooperation with everybody in every neighborhood around here, the bears are going to come in for a free lunch,"" Florida Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Karen Parker said. Unprovoked black bear attacks in Florida are extremely rare. The first one documented by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission was last year. The problem, biologists say, is that people are now living in areas that bears once called home. And bears like to roam. 12-year-old bear attack survivor: 'I just thought I was going to die' Alaska hunter mauled by bear survives 36 hours in wilderness .

"(CNN) -- It took only hours after the identities of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing were revealed for some politicians and commentators to suggest that the tragedy was somehow the fault of a broken immigration system. Ever since September 11, there has been a strong and understandable desire for a perfect screening system for would-be immigrants. If only the United States could put that system into place, bad people would never be admitted to the country. But such perfection is unachievable, and would not have prevented the Boston attacks. It would be a further tragedy to allow sensible overhaul of the U.S. immigration system to be derailed by such misperceptions. Here's what we know so far. The two brothers suspected in the bombings, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, were brought to the United States by their parents in 2002, likely from the former Soviet Republic of Kyrgyzstan. That means one was a child and the other in his early teens when they moved to Boston. The younger brother became a U.S. citizen last year and the older brother held a green card. The family was originally from Chechnya, a region that has long resisted Russian rule, and where the mostly Muslim Chechens have been fighting for independence from the Russian government of Vladimir Putin, and have carried out attacks again Russian civilians. Could the two have been stopped by immigration controls? The immigrant and visitor screening systems created by the U.S. government after 9/11 are designed to identify people whose history gives cause for concern. Consular officers and Department of Homeland Security officials check names against long terrorist watch lists and search for criminal records. Those with suspicious travel histories -- to places such as Afghanistan or Yemen -- are subject to extra scrutiny. Secure passports and the fingerprints taken from all new arrivals help prevent fraud. The database also includes records of fingerprints lifted by the U.S. military and intelligence from battlefields and safe houses in Afghanistan, Iraq and other terrorist hot spots. All these systems make the United States far more secure than it was a decade ago against those with terrorist or criminal histories. They do nothing, however, to protect us against the children of immigrants who might later become radicalized. Like Britain after the 2005 London subway bombings, which were committed largely by young, second-generation immigrants, the United States can no longer think this is only a foreign problem. Radicalism can find fertile ground at home as well as overseas. Does that mean the Boston attacks have nothing at all to do with immigration? That would not be a reasonable conclusion either. A country that opens itself to immigrants, as the United States has for many decades, invites in both the goods and ills of the world. Boston, for instance, is a city teeming with bright foreign students, many of whom will go on to make great contributions to the United States. Indeed, one of the victims of Monday's bombing was Lingzi Lu, a Boston University math and statistics graduate student from Shenyang, China, who often told her friends how much she loved Boston. But immigration also brings with it the disputes of other cultures. In 1985, when I was living in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada -- a city that abounds with Asian immigrants -- an Air India flight from Montreal to Delhi was blown up over the Atlantic Ocean, killing 268 Canadians, 27 Britons and 24 Indians. The architects were Sikh extremists who had emigrated from India to Canada and were fighting for causes of which few Canadians had ever heard. The two-decade long investigation that followed was traumatic for Canadians and for the many Indian immigrants with no ties to or cause with the radicals. But Canada moved on and remains a vibrant society that is largely welcoming of immigrants. It is not yet clear what motivated the Tsarnaev brothers to allegedly detonate a pressure cooker filled with explosives, nails and ball bearings at the finish line of one of the greatest foot races in the world. Both could well have become caught up in the extremism that has roiled too much of the Islamic world and caused others to carry out horrifying, senseless attacks against the innocent. Or they may have had other dark reasons. But what is certain is that the United States cannot shield itself by closing its doors to immigrants, or even by coming up with still better screening tools. This country needs and deserves a far better immigration system, which is the goal of the immigration effort under way. But we should be realistic about what it can and cannot do to protect us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward Alden.","After Boston suspects ID'd, politicians start blaming immigration system .
Alden: Perfect screening is impossible and wouldn't have prevented the bombings .
The U.S. can't shield itself with better screening or by keeping immigrants out .
We need immigration reform, but must be realistic about what it can and can't do ."
"(CNN) -- iPads will soon be ubiquitous in American Airlines cockpits, but don't expect pilots to be playing ""Angry Birds"" instead of paying attention to the flight path. AA is striving to go all-digital by the end of 2012, replacing pilots' bulky 35-pound bags full of navigational charts, log books and other flight reference materials with the 1.5-pound Apple tablets. It's a move that the airline says will save at least $1.2 million a year, based on current fuel prices. ""That's even on the low end,"" said Capt. David Clark, an active AA pilot and spokesman for the company. ""Really, we know what each aircraft burns in terms of weight per hour, so for every pound, you can measure the fuel burn."" iPads aren't new on the scene. The Federal Aviation Administration approved the use of the tablets in 2011, but American is the first commercial carrier to receive the agency's approval to use them in the cockpit during all phases of flight from gate to gate, including during landing and takeoff. Many airlines are using flight apps, which don't require Wi-Fi once installed on the tablets. Clark says the initiative is designed to not only save American money but, since each flight bag is made up of thousands of pages that must be updated constantly, to be a valuable time-saver as well. ""It takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, an hour and a half, for revisions to take out the old page and put new pages in. That's at least three to four times a month,"" he said. User error in misplacing a page here or there will be eliminated, improving the navigational charts' accuracy. ""We've got all of our charts into a digital format,"" Clark said. ""Every two weeks, we get revisions. It pushes updates, we touch the icon, and it updates."" Eliminating the need for the reams of paper each kitbag requires is another consideration, as well as preventing personal injuries. ""Each kitbag can weigh 35 to 45 pounds,"" Clark said. ""It's a quality of life thing. We have a lot of pilots in these very small cockpits that are trying to gingerly place kitbags in very small (areas). We've seen pulled muscles and injuries on duty."" United Airlines has been paperless since last year, distributing 11,000 iPads to all United and Continental pilots for use in the cockpit. It's unclear if or how soon United will match American in getting the FAA's approval for iPad use during all phases of flight. Delta says that although it has been experimenting with moving to an electronic flight bag program, no formal decision has been made to go to tablets just yet. While the iPad is the only tablet currently approved by the FAA to replace current flight kits, other tablets could be authorized as well. ""It's a game-changer,"" Clark said. ""I'm in my 23rd year (with American Airlines). If you just fly one trip with me, you could see the amazing difference all that weight, and all the monotony of doing all those revisions, can make."" He understands that consumers may have concerns about playing games or being distracted by other entertaining iPad apps. ""We are professionals, we have rules that we follow, and our licenses and crew depend on our being professional and following the rules. And our pilots are good at that. We self-police, so we will be keeping an eye out.""","Some airlines are phasing in iPads for pilots to replace heavy manuals and charts .

"Washington (CNN) -- You can describe it as a political convention or a carnival, but either way, all eyes are on the Conservative Political Action Conference this week. The three-day event -- better known by its initials, CPAC -- kicks off Thursday at National Harbor, a major convention center just outside of the nation's capital. The conference is the largest annual gathering of conservative leaders and activists, and when there's no Republican in the White House, it's a must-attend cattle call for GOP presidential hopefuls looking to pass the conference's conservative litmus test. CPAC will close Saturday with the much-watched results of the confab's GOP presidential nomination straw poll. ""After the Super Bowl and the two parties' national conventions, CPAC is the most covered event in the country,"" Al Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative Union, the organization that puts on the conference, told CNN. Latest developments . ""It's the only venue where thousands of activists get to see, back to back during our three-day conference, the likely 2016 leading GOP presidential candidates and begin to create perceptions which last through Election Day."" Among those addressing the crowd this year are nearly all the major names among the potential 2016 Republican White House contenders. They include Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee. Also speaking are Govs. Rick Perry of Texas, who ran for the Republican nomination in 2012, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Chris Christie of New Jersey, who wasn't invited last year because he wasn't considered conservative enough. Inside Politics: Will CPAC be launch of Cruz 2016? Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who also ran for the White House in 2012, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who made a bid for the nomination in 2008, are addressing the audience. And don't forget about former Alaska Gov. and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and Donald Trump, who seem to be flirting with 2016 bids. ""The reason so many presidential hopefuls come to CPAC is because they get to take a measure of themselves before an activist audience, and that audience gets to take its measure of the potential candidates,"" Republican communications strategist Keith Appell told CNN. ""CPAC still provides both the contenders and the pretenders these opportunities,"" added Appell, a senior vice president at CRC Public Relations, a Washington, D.C., PR firm that has had many conservative clients. Republican strategist Ana Navarro says this year's colder and snowier-than-normal winter in the Washington area won't keep conservatives away. ""Thousands of people trek to snow- and ice-covered Washington for three days to listen to Republican leaders preach the gospel to the faithful. I'd call that relevant. It's a good platform to keep the Republican base, and many young people, energized and charged up,"" said Navarro, a CNN contributor. CPAC changes mind, won't allow atheist group at conference . CPAC has its critics . Some conservatives say that CPAC has become too mainstream. ""I think CPAC is really RPAC these days and is as much, if not more, lobbyist oriented than grass-roots oriented. It is like church homecoming for the Republican Party, wrote Erick Erickson, co-founder of RedState.com and a leading voice on the right. And Rep. Steve King, an outspoken conservative from Iowa, said in a prepared statement that he ""will neither speak at nor attend the Conservative Political Action Conference."" Instead, King will join other conservatives in addressing a National Security Action Summit being held just a few blocks away from CPAC. Spotlight on Christie . While most of the major potential 2016 contenders will address CPAC, two will be absent: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had previous business commitments, and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin has events to attend in his home state. Both spoke at CPAC last year. While the spotlight's on the speeches in the main ballroom, for the possible White House hopefuls, some of the real action is away from the cameras, in private meetings with top activists, strategists and rainmakers. One of those possible presidential contenders is Christie. The pragmatic Garden State governor, never popular with many in the party's conservative base, was not invited to last year's conference. CPAC organizers said Christie was snubbed because some of his positions were not conservative enough. Are controversies helping Christie with conservatives? Christie is currently awash in allegations that some of his aides closed access lanes to the George Washington Bridge last September to punish the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, for not endorsing Christie's re-election. The governor has denied knowing anything about the gridlock until after it occurred and has said he knew nothing about any political mischief by members of his administration. While one tea party leader told CNN he was ""stunned"" that Christie was invited this year, Cardenas, the American Conservative Union chairman, said the national media coverage of the controversies in New Jersey might help Christie with the party's base, which doesn't like to see Republicans attacked by the media, adding that the episode's made conservatives ""kindred spirits with Gov. Christie."" While many conservatives may not be Christie fans, they like the mainstream media even less. ""I think Christie is going to get a good reception, maybe even better than he would have before the bridge thing. He's a good, engaging, energetic speaker. He's been under attack by mainstream media and Democrats everywhere. The enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" added Navarro, the GOP strategist. Straw poll scrutiny . The results of the CPAC straw poll are analyzed and scrutinized on TV and online. But the idea that the results are any kind of barometer of what will actually happen in the battle for the GOP nomination are extremely debatable. But the straw poll is useful. ""The straw poll is still more of a scrimmage of expectations. Beat the expectations, and you can generate a lot of buzz among the media and activists,"" said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist, CNN contributor and senior adviser to Mitt Romney in the former Massachusetts governor's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. In 2007, Romney, considered in tune with conservative activists at the time, made winning at CPAC a priority. And he met expectations with a straw poll victory. He won again in 2008, narrowly edging out eventual GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who was not a favorite of the conservative base. Romney won even though he ended his bid for the Republican nomination on the first day of the conference. Then-Rep. Ron Paul of Texas won the straw poll in 2010 and 2011, in between his two bids for the GOP nomination. His victories were proof of the strong libertarian influence on the CPAC straw poll. Romney won in 2012, as he was battling two more conservative candidates: Santorum and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Romney's 2012 appearance is less remembered for his straw poll victory than for his description of himself as ""severely conservative"" in his speech to the audience. Last year's contest ended up being a two-person race, with Rand Paul winning the straw poll with 25% of the vote, one percentage point ahead of Rubio. The 21 other people on the ballot were far behind, registering in single digits. This year, 26 names are on the straw poll ballot.","CPAC is the country's largest gathering of conservative leaders and activists .

"(CNN) -- My family moved to Bahrain in the late eighties when I was only three years old. Like many Western expats who grew up in Bahrain, I was fairly insulated from local politics. None of my friends or their parents talked politics, and most Western expatriates like myself lived in safe, walled compounds, segregated and separate from Bahrain's villages. Read more: Bahrain enacts stiff laws against 'terrorism' before opposition protests . Even during the 1990s intifada in Bahrain, I do not remember witnessing much trouble. I heard the odd skirmish, and the occasional siren, but as a child you tend to think that the police are the good guys and anyone giving them trouble are ""the bad guys."" Sometimes people would discuss ""trouble in the villages,"" but other than that, my ignorance of the situation was the result of youthful indifference cultivated by an informal apartheid. Fast forward to 2013, and my youthful ignorance serves as a useful metaphor for the alarming extent of apparent Western indifference to the ongoing political crisis in Bahrain. Zakaria: Bahrain will pay heavy price for crackdown . Despite a lack of media coverage, state sponsored repression has been going on for the past two years. Skirmishes in villages between groups of youths and the riot police occur almost daily, and while the former burn tires and throw Molotov cocktails, the latter fumigate the villages with tear gas, a tactic so virulent that one NGO accused the Bahrain authorities of ""weaponizing toxic chemical agents."" The skirmishes in the villages are symptomatic of over two years of repression by the Bahraini authorities. Peaceful demands for political reform put forward by thousands of Bahrainis in early 2011 have been ignored, and legitimate attempts to protest have been brutally repressed. Renewed calls for demonstrations on August 14 have prompted the government to initiate a fresh swathe of repressive measures. Bahrain's opposition-less parliament recently passed reactionary laws banning peaceful gatherings in Bahrain's capital city and checkpoints, roadblocks and barbed wire fences have been erected around villages to stop people getting to protests. Keen to censor any criticism, the Bahraini authorities have also arrested a number of activists and journalists, while some foreign observers have been denied entry. A lawyer representing a citizen journalist was even arrested for tweeting about the fact his client was tortured by police -- as if the message was not clear enough. The prime minister declared that Bahrain would ""burn to a cinder all those who seek to tamper with its security and stability,"" It is unlikely that these ""Tamorrod"" protests will amount to anything, especially as the Bahraini authorities have spent the past two years breaking the back of the opposition movement. In 2011, thousands were arrested, tens killed, and dozens tortured. Doctors who bore witness to the gross excesses of the security forces were tortured and imprisoned on spurious charges. Leaders of several political societies were arrested, tortured, and put in jail, where they still remain. Thousands were fired from their jobs for participating in legal strikes. The state media spewed out sectarian hatred, and Sunni and secular support for the populist movement was tempered by government propaganda that claimed, despite there being no evidence, that the pro-democracy movement was an Iranian-backed attempt to install a Shia theocratic state. The government also demolished a number of Shia religious structures in order to anger Shia protesters and encourage them to become violent, and thus lessen moderate support for the movement. In an attempt to reduce popular sympathy for the pro-democracy movement, the government portrayed the movement as xenophobic and intolerant by exaggerating protesters' attacks on expats. A government spokesman implied that 12 expats had been killed by protesters in 2011. In actual fact, two expats were killed by civilians, while one was shot by the Bahrain Defence Force. Expats who publicly express sympathy for the opposition risk deportation. Recently an American teacher was kicked out of Bahrain for writing articles critical of the government. Between the blatant repression of 2011 and the recent reactionary measures ahead of August 14, there has also been an insidious attack on freedom of expression and due process in Bahrain. Insulting the King on Twitter or ""inciting hatred"" against the security forces will land you in jail, while activists are spending months in detention before trial -- often without access to a lawyer. Torture and forced confessions are reportedly still ongoing, and no one has been held accountable for any of the alleged state crimes perpetrated over the past two years. On the contrary, Bahrain's prime minister was recently filmed thanking a suspected torturer for his services and promising his supporters impunity. The prospects for Bahrain's pro-democracy movement are bleak, especially without Western support. Obama's recent call for meaningful reform in Bahrain was disconcertingly vague, and in his September 2012 address to the U.N., Obama failed to mention Bahrain despite expressing the need to support freedom elsewhere in the Arab world. The unrest in Bahrain has also provided many commercial opportunities for Western companies and individuals. U.S. arms sales to Bahrain since the year 2000 have totalled $1.4 billion, and the Bahraini government have paid more than $32 million to Washington and London-based public relations companies to help whitewash human rights abuses. In 2011, the Bahraini authorities used U.S.-made tear gas on protesters, and ex-Miami police chief John Timoney went to Bahrain to help ""reform"" the police. Some of the Bahraini police have even received training from the U.S. military. The current U.S. position can be explained by the fact the Bahraini government allows the U.S. to keep a naval base on the island -- and as long as U.S.-Iranian tensions continue, Bahrain's strategic value will remain high. Unfortunately for Bahrain's pro-democracy movement, the U.S. are not going to risk upsetting the Bahraini government by pressuring for too much ""meaningful"" political reform. This continued U.S. support for a brutal regime is leading to increased resentment towards the American government by many Bahrainis, who feel let down by a nation that claims to support those who aspire to greater freedom, democracy, and liberty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marc Owen Jones.","State sponsored repression has been going on for the past two years, Marc Owen Jones writes .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Eleanor Coppola met her husband, Francis in Ireland in 1962. Eleanor Coppola with husband Francis. They have been married for 47 years. It was on the set of splatter flick ""Dementia 13"" -- she was the shy set decorator; he was the ambitious rookie director. They began dating and three months later she became pregnant and the couple married. That was 47 years ago and since then the retiring artist has become something of a chronicler of the extraordinary Coppola family, which includes her flamboyant Oscar-winning husband, daughter, Sophia and actors Nicolas Cage and Jason Schwartzman. Life with Francis has also allowed her a ringside seat during the making of some of the most revered films in cinematic history. Most famously, she was in the Philippines in 1976 during the notoriously difficult production of ""Apocalypse Now,"" the war epic that almost destroyed Francis' blossoming career. Her little camera captured revealing footage of her husband as he and his actors and crew unraveled psychologically, much like the characters in the film. The footage was subsequently immortalized in the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse."" Here Eleanor Coppola talks exclusively to CNN about her pride at seeing Sophia win an Oscar, what Francis is really like and just how close ""Apocalypse Now"" came to disaster. The Screening Room: Is Francis different on set than at home? Eleanor Coppola: No. I think because he spent his life as a director it's just in his nature. It's in his blood. He is always directing. So, when he gets home he's directing the dinner, where we are gonna sit, what we are going to eat. I've adjusted to it, so now it's really funny. TSR: What does Francis enjoy most in life? EC: People might not realize what a good sense of humor he has. He really likes to sing, he can sing a song about anything. He'll make up a song, set to a major show tune about anything. If he were here this moment he could make up a song about you. TSR: Do his films mirror life? EC: Definitely the ones he has written; the original pieces resonate with his life and aspects that reflect the way his life has evolved. He does address the issues -- both the positive and the darker side too. I think ""The Godfather"" was a raw example of his experience at weddings, with family, and he just took his experiences and viewed those characters with the familiar aspects that he had known. TSR: What was Francis' inspiration for ""Apocalypse Now?"" EC: After making ""The Godfather,"" ""The Godfather: Part II"" and ""The Conversation,"" in which he felt like so many of the scenes he was shooting were inside these dark rooms and were about the complex relationship between the characters, he had the idea that he was going to go out to the Philippines on location and make this big shoot about the green landscape and everybody was going to be out in the sun -- light, expansive, exciting. Just a fun, big war film. But once he got out there, he found that he got delving into the research for the material -- he realized this was no lightweight thing. This was a war and people lost their children, sons, husbands. He realized it had more serious themes and considerations and it took him deeper and deeper into himself, the issues of life and death and all the heavy questions of war an epic brings to life. TSR: How did ""Apocalypse Now"" affect Francis' state of mind? EC: It was a journey for him up the river I always felt. He went deeper and deeper into himself and deeper and deeper and deeper into the production. It just got out of control. He didn't have the ending. He didn't know how to deal with it. The script was evolving and the scenes were changing -- it just got larger and more complex. And little by little he got out there as far as his characters. That wasn't the intention at all at the beginning. TSR: Tell me about how the documentary you shot while Francis was making ""Apocalypse Now"" came about. EC: I never intended to make the documentary of all documentaries. I was just trying to keep myself occupied with something to do because we were out there for so long. I just had never shot a documentary before. They wanted five minutes for a TV promotional or something and I thought sooner of later I could get five minutes of film and then it went on to 15 minutes. I just kept shooting but I had no idea ... the evolution of myself that I saw with my camera. So, it was a surprise for both of us and a life changing experience. TSR: In what way was it a life-changing experience? EC: When you do something that's the most extreme and hardest thing you have ever done -- everything is in jeopardy; your personal life, your financial life is in jeopardy and people's lives were literally in jeopardy. Two people lost their lives in that production, in the course of building. It involved 700 people to build the temple and there was an accident. So, it was a powerful experience and I think we came back in a new place. When you stretch yourself that far, you are able to come back in a deeper more thoughtful way. TSR: Francis is known to fight for his actors, like when he insisted on having young unknown Al Pacino in ""The Godfather"" against the studio's wishes . EC: I think his vision is extremely clear. That is just the way his life is. So, when someone says you can't have the green chair on this set, that isn't acceptable to him. He just doesn't see it that way. It is the way his vision perceives it and there aren't any alternatives. So, if people say ""no"" to him, he just brushes that aside and he pays no attention. TSR: What's it like to watch your children, Roman and Sophia who are both film directors on set? EC: It has been deeply satisfying for them to find their way and find their voice, I think particularly for Sophia. I shot a documentary for ""The Virgin Suicides"" and then also ""Marie Antoinette,"" so I was there seeing her blossom and emerge. TSR: What was it like seeing Sophia win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for ""Lost in Translation"" in 2004? EC: Well, I was deeply thrilled, particularly because she's a woman and I thought it was so touching that the children actually do reflect their parents and their upbringing and their parents' abilities do seem to have been passed on to their children. It was very emotional moment to see her. Especially because Francis won a screenplay Oscar at the same age, both 32, so that was a touching circle of life.","Eleanor Coppola is married to legendary filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola .

"CANNES, France (CNN) -- The line-up at this year's Cannes Film Festival is a cineaste's dream. There are high expectations for Jane Campion's ""Bright Star,"" a drama about 19th-century poet John Keats. Packed with big name auteurs (Pedro Almodovar, Ken Loach, Lars Von Trier, Quentin Tarantino, and Park Chan-wook among others) and intriguing propositions, the competition for the coveted Palme d'Or is sure to be fierce. While there may be a dearth of surprises in the line-up, the world's shiniest cinema event has certainly proved that in these tough economic times it can still cherry pick the best of what's out there. But what among the dizzying array of celluloid magic has caught the eye of industry insiders and professionals? The Screening Room asked a blogger, a critic and a film buyer attending the festival what films they will be watching out for at this year's event. THE CRITIC . Name: Jonathan Romney . Credentials: Film critic for British newspaper The Independent on Sunday . Cannes experience: 17 years . It's heavily loaded with big names and the strange thing is that this year there are very few surprises in there. Last year there was Italian Matteo Garrone's ""Gomorrah"" (which won the Grand Prize) and Israeli Ari Folman's animation ""Waltz with Bashir,"" films that nobody knew anything about in competition. The one that people are either really looking forward to or dreading is ""Enter the Void,"" Gaspar Noe's new film. Noe gave everybody a rough time in 2002 with ""Irreversible,"" a violent, confrontational rape-revenge drama. The thing about him is once he's got you in the cinema you're not going to get out. This one has been made in Japan and is the story of someone looking at the events leading up to their own death. In particular, I'll be looking at Jane Campion's film, ""Bright Star,"" starring Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw. It's based on the three-year romance between 19th-century poet Keats and Fanny Brawne, which was cut short by his death at the age of 25. She hasn't delivered for quite a while. Her last few films were at best patchy and at worst disappointing. She's shown skill at her version of costume dramas in the past with films like ""The Piano,"" which won the Palme d'Or in 1994. Five-times Palme d'Or nominated German[-born] Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon"" is another film people are talking about. It is set in 1914 and is apparently about the emergence of Nazism. I imagine it will be fairly austere and confrontational. I also imagine it will be very good. He has never made a film that doesn't really engage or impress on some level. There's also Danish Cannes stalwart Lars von Trier's film ""Antichrist,"" starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg about a grieving couple who retreat to a small cabin in the forest to mourn following the death of their child. There has been some controversy over why he is making what looks like a conventional Hollywood horror. It almost certainly won't be that. I suspect it will be philosophical. A lot of these filmmakers are not entertainers. They like to give their audiences a hard time. One of the keynotes of this year is going to be confrontation. THE BLOGGER . Name: Karina Longworth . Credentials: Co-founder of Cinematical film blog and editor of Spout blog . Cannes experience: two years . In the Directors' Fortnight section I'm really excited about ""Go Get Some Rosemary,"" which is directed by these two young American brothers, Joshua and Benny Safdie. Their style is reminiscent of the French New Wave -- but with this sense of humor and willingness to experiment in real locations, and use the people that are walking by as accidental characters. They're sometimes lumped together with the young American ""Mumblecore"" scene but their films are really different. They've got a really interesting sense of style. Another film I'm really excited about is a documentary by French Oscar-winner Michel Gondry. The English title is ""The Thorn in the Heart,"" and it is about his aunt. Because it is in the Special Screening section and it's not in competition, it won't get the full red carpet treatment. But while the international press is looking the other way, if it's really good it could stand out from the crowd. Of course I'm excited to see a Quentin Tarantino movie, but my experience of being at Cannes is that going to see one of those giant films ends up taking all day long. I try to go and see films that I might not ever be able to see again. The film I'm most excited about seeing is Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist."" It looks sort of ""Rosemary's Baby""-ish and it is a return to working in English with American-known actors. I'm also looking forward to Jane Campion's new film. THE BUYER . Name: Robert Walak . Credentials: Senior vice-president, Acquisitions Worldwide, Momentum Pictures . Cannes experience: seven years . Sometimes a film is going to ""pop"" where you least expect it, and it's often not the film with established directors. It's quite difficult to find those -- the ones that create industry buzz, the ones that the critics suddenly go for, but also when you finally do get around to releasing it in your territory that the film actually crosses over and becomes an art house hit. I've already read the scripts for a lot of the films in competition -- you really want to get all of the information and do your homework. This year there's buzz about a film by an Iranian director, Bahman Qobadi, called ""No One Knows Persian Cats,"" which is being sold by innovative production company Wild Bunch. Qobadi has served as a juror on the Cannes jury before and took home a Golden Camera award in 2000 for ""A Time for Drunken Horses,"" a drama about young Iranian Kurds. I'm also looking forward to ""Antichrist."" It's going to be interesting to see what von Triers' take on a horror movie is going to be. The script was off the wall and I want to see how he brings it all together. The Ken Loach film ""Looking for Eric,"" which stars ex-footballer Eric Cantona, is meant to be fantastic. It's already sold in the UK but the script was wonderful and I think it's going to be a very distinctive, different film for Loach. Feel-good is a very overused term, but people are going to be looking for more feel-good films now anyway.","From Quentin Tarantino to Ken Loach, Cannes is packed with big names .

"(CNN) -- A new French government was announced Tuesday, one day after it dissolved amid turmoil among top ministers. The biggest change was the naming of a new economic minister, Emmanuel Macron, who replaces Arnaud Montebourg. French media reported that the upheaval was caused by public calls from Montebourg for a major reorientation of economic policy in a country where growth has stalled and unemployment remains high. Macron, a close associate of President Francois Hollande's, is a former banker. The former economic minister's comments were seen as a challenge to the authority of Hollande, and the change tightens the President's reins over the ministry. Manuel Valls was confirmed as Prime Minister again. Valls has been in the post since March 31, replacing Jean-Marc Ayrault. The new government also includes the nation's first female education minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem. Laurent Fabius remains foreign minister and minister for international development, Michel Sapin remains minister of finance and public accounts, and Jean-Yves Le Drian remains defense minister. Socialist leader Hollande said Monday that he wants the new government to be ""a team that is coherent with the course that he himself has set for our country."" Hollande has the worst approval ratings of any French President on record. Valls' popularity, meanwhile, has shown a decline in recent opinion polls. CNN's Justin Hoffmann, Jim Bitterman, Jethro Mullen and Carol Jordan contributed to this report.","France announces new ministers .

"London, England (CNN) -- Working together must be easy for Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, the award-winning movie producers. More often than not, the co-chairmen of Working Title Films finish off each other's sentences, revealing a mutual respect that has its roots in a strong friendship that has spanned two decades. The London-based producers began working together in 1992. Two years later, they had their first massive hit, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" It took $245 million worldwide by then ticket prices, according to boxofficemojo.com, with more than three-quarters of that coming from outside the United States.  Since then the pair have been on a rollercoaster ride. Their long list of worldwide blockbusters includes ""Bridget Jones Diary,"" ""Notting Hill"" and ""Billy Elliott,"" proving, more than once, that you don't have to be American to be a success in Hollywood. Here, the champions of the British film industry talk exclusively to CNN about the future of movies, bad reviews and why they don't sleep at nights. The Screening Room: What exactly does a producer do? Tim Bevan: A producer facilitates a film being made; there are different levels of facilitation. For instance, we work with the Coen [Brothers] a lot on their movies. They know what they're doing. They've got a great deal of experience. So, the facilitation is raising the money and ensuring that it's spent correctly -- but they're responsible in doing that -- and then working on the marketing and distribution of the films. At the other end of the spectrum, we would facilitate a film that is an idea we'd had ourselves and we're intimately involved in all areas of the production, as well as financing it and overseeing the marketing and distribution. Eric Fellner: There are three key components; the financial aspects, the making aspect and the marketing aspect. You've got to come with the idea, get it made brilliantly with the best possible people and then get it to the market as quickly and as effectively as you can. TSR: What are the attributes a producer should have or needs to have in order to survive in this business? TB: The producer needs to be a fool -- a determined fool! You have to be incredibly tenacious because there are a lot of ""nos"" out there, the whole thing is a bit like herding cats. You have to keep at it and keep at it and one day you get there, to the movie. EF: The natural response to anything one is trying to do is ""no."" The only way you can make things happen is by turning the ""nos"" into ""yeses."" TSR: How have the market conditions changed from when this company first started and when you first made the film that made your name? TB: The biggest thing that has changed is the cost of making films because like everything it's gone up and up and up. Even bigger than the cost of making films is the cost of marketing them. TSR: How has the recession impacted your industry? EF: I think it's a bit too early to say. We've only had nine months worth of films out in this downturn period. From what I see, it looks like as many, if not more, people are going to the cinema but they are going to less types of movies. If they're going to make the effort to go out, it looks to me like they're going out because they want to be purely entertained. They don't want thought-provoking, they don't want difficult, they don't want dark, they don't want dramatic. They want things that are going to take them out of their everyday lives. TSR: How important are negative reviews? TB: Really bad reviews can hurt pretty much any movie. They say that some films are review-proof but I think that's probably big high-concept movies, comedies and so on. But, on the whole, if a film gets dreadful reviews it will affect its business. TSR: Is there a film that has kept you awake at night or you thought would never get made? EF: Every single one. They're all enormously difficult propositions. There's no such thing as an easy film. In terms of a film that was kind of pivotal, boringly we have to say ""Four Weddings"" because it was the first big hit that we had and it gave everyone a certain confidence that we hadn't had before, that you can make a small British film and take it out around the world as a success. Up until then, a lot of the films we'd been making had critical success, but none of them had really found their mark on a business level. We were probably 25-30 movies in between us. We were a long way into our careers. TB: But it wasn't only for us, it was for British films actually. It proved to the world that a British movie could go out and do Hollywood-style business around the world and, interestingly, as it has been proven in a lot of our subsequent movies, it was out of the territories outside of America where that revenue really came from. TSR:  Why does this partnership work so well? TB: I think it's a mutual respect. We learnt very early on that it was much better to make the big decisions together -- shall we make the movie, who's going to be in it, who's going to direct it -- and then for one of us to run with the film from there, because that way we can cover more ground. Also, it's an easy way of doing it. We're not likely to step on each other toes that way around.","Award-winning producers Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner began their partnership in 1992 .

"WUGANG, China (CNN)  -- Hengjiang Village is nestled in the lush mountains of China's Hunan province, just a few kilometers from the bustling city of Wugang. It is a simple place, where mopeds carrying families of four zoom up and down dirt roads, and villagers drink water from local wells. Xiao Junmei spent more than 20 days in hospital recovering from severe lead poisoning. Their simple, unassuming way of life was shattered when children started getting sick. A few cases turned into hundreds and parents started to worry. So far, 1,354 children in Hunan province have tested positive for abnormal levels of lead in their blood, authorities say. Lead poisoning is a devastating side effect of industrial pollution. In Shaanxi province's Fengxiang County, 851 children recently also turned up with high lead levels along with more than 200 in Yunnan province. All of them live near industrial plants, some only a few hundred feet away. Local officials say eight factories in Wenping and Simachong, including the plant in Hengjiang, have since been shut down, including coal, manganese and iron smelting plants. Environmental protection officials from the central government have been dispatched to various locations to conduct factory inspections and environmental evaluations. Authorities say all factories will remain closed until they meet official safety standards.  Watch Chang's report on lead poisonings in Fengxiang » . Two executives at a manganese factory in Wenping have been detained. The general manager was on the run for two weeks but turned himself in on August 27. ""What they did is totally wrong,"" Wugang government spokesman Lei Zanning told CNN. ""The factory and the boss have violated the production safety standards. This is the result of illegal production and construction."" Authorities say children living up to 20 kilometers away from factories have been affected, and more were being tested. The government is offering free examinations for children under 14 years old and compensation for affected families.  See photos of the families, the plants and the kindergarten where cases were first found » . Although officials have showed remorse and concern, villagers said they have been intimidated to keep quiet.  Watch Chang's report on being followed by officials during one of her lead poisoning investigation » . Upon arriving at Hengjiang Village, residents rushed our crew behind homes before we could be seen by local government ""spotters"" or police. Once they felt safe, one parent after another recounted tales of their sick children.  Watch Chang meet the parents and children » . ""My baby's been in the hospital for more than 20 days,"" said Xiao Aijun, of his 10-month-old daughter Xiao Junmei. ""We have to go back in the month. Look at her hair, look at her hair!"" Xiao said Junmei's hair is not growing properly and his older daughter has lost her appetite. Lead poisoning can cause severe developmental problems in children ranging from anemia to stomach pains and permanent brain damage. Doctors say the only treatment that is available is incredibly high-risk, and cannot completely rid the body of lead. Lead not only infiltrates the bloodstream, but also the body's soft tissue and bones and can cause lifelong consequences. According to doctors, pregnant women can also pass lead poisoning on to their unborn children. ""The government hasn't done anything to take care of pregnant women,"" said Liu Yanqun, who is seven months pregnant. ""My first child miscarried due to external factors, and this is my second. The government just doesn't care."" ""Of course, I'm worried about my baby's future,"" Liu added. ""Is my baby going to be like these children with lead poisoning, with birth defects?"" A government notice posted in town outlines a compensation plan for families with sick kids, but also warned villagers not to ""spread rumors"" or cause trouble. ""They're insulting us,"" said one man. ""Yeah, all they want us to do is stop talking,"" said another woman. At the manganese plant down the street from Hengjiang Village, another public notice indicates there was recently a protest there, during which some equipment was damaged. The notice says the government will be lenient to those who turn themselves in. Those who provide information will be rewarded. Protests in response to industrial pollution are increasingly common in China where health and environmental standards have at times been sacrificed to promote economic development. According to reports, up to 10,000 villagers recently rioted at a sewage plant in Fujian province, claiming it is responsible for causing cancer. The protesters reportedly clashed with 2,000 police who fired warning shots and tear gas to break up the crowd. Environmentalists say pollution will continue to be a challenge for local governments that are often poorly equipped to monitor the environmental impact of factories in their areas. ""Local environmental bureaus don't have much capacity or resources to conduct frequent inspections,"" said Steven Ma of Greenpeace China. Regardless, Ma said, ""GDP growth is still like the first priority for a lot of local governments although ... the central government is more aware of a necessity for more balanced development."" In the case of lead and other metals, contamination may be more widespread than many local villagers can anticipate. Lead can remain in the air, water, soil and crops even after the source of contamination is cut off. ""If you don't reduce the use of heavy metals at the source it's very difficult to actually treat them after they're released into the environment,"" said Ma. ""So it poses a long term threat to environment in China. According to the government, about 10 percent of the nation's arable land is contaminated with lead, and annually about 12 million tons of food crops are contaminated by lead."" Children with the most serious cases of lead poisoning in Hengjiang Village and surrounding areas are being treated at local clinics and larger hospitals in nearby Changsha. Parents said hospital officials asked them to sign forms agreeing not to talk to journalists. However, they defied orders and agreed to meet us outside to tell us their stories. Many of their children are undergoing risky medical treatment that while helpful, cannot completely reverse the damage that has already been done. ""When the manganese plant was built, we didn't really know the influence it would have on our families,"" said mother Luo Meiling, clutching her daughter. ""If we knew, we wouldn't have been living there in the first place. We had no idea the plant would poison our children.""","About 1,354 children in Hunan province test positive for abnormal levels of lead .

"(CNN) -- Despite being recently branded a ""rotten apple"" by AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi, Mario Balotelli was treated to a rapturous reception on his return to the northern Italian city. With votes at stake in the Italian elections -- La Stamp estimates the signing of ""Super Mario"" could be worth 400,000 votes as Berlusconi attempts a political comeback -- his new boss' blunt assessment was quickly forgotten as the former Italian prime minister sanctioned a $30 million deal to sign Balotelli. His transfer ends the striker's whirlwind two-and-half-year stay with English champions Manchester City, during which time a litany of dust-ups have allowed Balotelli to become a caricature of the modern playboy footballer -- sporting talent and tabloid cult hero rolled into one. One of his final acts as a City player was a training ground brawl with team manager Roberto Mancini, pictures of which were sprawled across newspapers. In the aftermath of the dust-up, Balotelli's teammate Carlos Tevez offered to counsel the 22-year-old striker. When Tevez, infamous for refusing to come off the substitutes bench during a match last season and subsequently going AWOL for three months, is doling out advise, it might be to seriously consider where your career is headed. Having signed a four-and-a-half-year deal, Balotelli's future now lies back in Milan, where he rose to prominence with AC's city rivals Inter between 2006 and 2010. Myriad stories -- both mythical and true -- surround Balotelli, who recently unveiled a head of bleach-blonde hair ahead of a match between second-place City and Arsenal. There's the one about Balotelli driving into a women's prison, or the time he reportedly threw darts at youth team players out of a training ground window -- not to mention the impromptu bonfire which burned down his bathroom hours before he became the face of a firework safety campaign. Or Balotelli being stopped by police for having thousands of pounds in a bag on the passenger seat of his car. His alleged response when inquisitive officers asked why he was carrying such a huge amount of cash was to say: ""Because I'm rich."" Outrageous talent . City showed admirable patience with their mercurial marksman, hoping he could consistently produce the form which saw him spearhead Italy's run to the final of Euro 2012. Balotelli endured a tempestuous relationship with former Inter coach and current Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho, but in Mancini, also a one-time coach of the Italian international at the Nerazzurri, he found a staunch ally, though the City manager used the striker with increasing sparsity. It's this mix of lashings of outrageous talent, outlandish behavior and childish ill-discipline -- Balotelli has already picked up six red cards in his fledgling career -- which have made him a gold mine for newspapers. Vincent Pericard is one former player who has experienced the high of being at a leading club and the low of languishing in the game's lesser leagues. Born in Cameroon, Pericard was raised in France -- representing his adoptive country at under-21 level -- before he was snapped up by Italian giants Juventus as a teenager. A bright future was predicted for the striker, but after leaving Juve in 2002 he moved to England and spent a decade slowly falling through the leagues. He made five appearances for sixth-tier club Havant & Waterlooville before retiring from football in 2012, aged just 29. Since quitting the game, Pericard has set up Elite Welfare Management, a business aimed at helping foreign players settle within the English game. ""The organization is the sum of my own experiences,"" the former Stoke City and Portsmouth player told CNN. ""We want to stop players wasting their talent. We should support and understand what makes him behave the way he does, instead of judging him and saying he is a lunatic or he is not bothered,"" added Pericard, referring to Balotelli, who is of Ghanaian heritage and was born in Perugia and raised by an adoptive family in Brescia in northern Italy. ""All the problems relate to the social side of being a human being and how you interact with other people and how you interact with a new culture and how you adapt to it."" Football clubs are experts when it comes to keeping a player in peak physical condition, but Pericard is convinced the game has room for improvement when it comes to addressing issues of mental well-being. ""A player spends 80% of his time outside of the club's supervision and only 20% inside of the club,"" continued the Frenchman. ""It is one thing to look at how a player is physically, but the mental well being of a player is just as important. It can be the difference between teams going up, getting relegated or reaching the Champions League. ""The mind plays a massive part in a player's development and performance and this is something clubs need to tap into if they want to increase their chances of winning."" The view that talent alone is not enough is one which is widely supported by sports psychologists. That is an approach not lost on five-time European champions Liverpool. As part of a new philosophy adapted by manager Brendan Rodgers, -- appointed at Anfield in June last year -- the club recruited Dr Steve Peters, who helped hone the minds of Britain's all-conquering Olympic cyclists. ""It is absolutely vital that young players are given support right from the start,"" said Rebecca Symes, Sport Psychologist from British organization Sporting Success, who argues the amount of psychological support available to footballers decreases as they progress into the first team. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), a body which represents the interests of soccer players in England and Wales, was not available for comment when contacted by CNN. ""The transition from an academy into a senior squad is a really significant time,"" continued Symes. ""I don't think enough emphasis is put on providing support to players during this transition and then throughout their professional career. ""While the access to support is a lot better compared to 10 years ago there is a lot of work still to do, especially in football."" With clubs in England's top division receiving unprecedented levels of income -- the recent sale of EPL television rights domestically and internationally is set to generate more than $8 billion according to British media reports -- Symes sees no reason why mental health professionals should not be given a higher profile at clubs. ""Don't get me wrong there is some great work being done by organisations such as the PFA; Sporting Chance Clinic and the like. But appropriately qualified internal backroom staff fully integrated within a club is essential."" Breaking into a top-flight team can transform a young player's life as they are exposed to the pressures of a voracious 24/7 media and experience a level of financial wealth which they previously would have probably only dreamed of. While sudden monetary gain itself might not destabilize a player, an inability to manage their finances in the long term might, suggests Dan Abrahams -- a sports psychologist specializing in football. ""I think its more having a capacity to deal with the wealth which comes to them,"" said Abrahams. ""Over time, if you're not doing that, it can create pressure. ""The club needs to produce a culture of excellence,"" added Abrahams. ""The five Cs -- culture; confidence, commitment, cohesion and caring. ""Many people would baulk at the last one. They might become multimillionaire footballers, but the only way they get there is if they have emotional and intellectual support."" After a career which shares some parallels with that of Balotelli, what advice would Pericard -- with the benefit of hindsight -- offer to the Italian? ""To seek help and accept help that will allow him to fulfil your potential and play until 35 and maybe be the best player in the world,"" he answered. ""With everything surrounding him, that is not going to happen. Accept the help that people are giving. Please accept it"".

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan government said Sunday that ruler Moammar Gadhafi's son and three of his grandchildren died in a NATO airstrike that the longtime strongman and his wife survived. Gadhafi and his wife were in their son's house when it was targeted, but they are in good health, government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told journalists. But the son, Saif al-Arab Gadhafi, and three of his children were killed, Ibrahim said. The Libyan government vowed to retaliate with death to ""invaders"" in the nation, and empty Western embassies were vandalized on Sunday, U.S. and Italian officials said. But CNN could not independently confirm the reported fatalities, and a spokesman for anti-Gadhafi rebels cast doubt on the claim even as it provoked celebratory gunfire in rebel-held Benghazi. Ibrahim slammed NATO after the airstrike, calling the attack an illegal act and a ""war crime."" He said the 29-year-old son killed was a student in Germany, the sixth of eight children. The strike destroyed the house in Tripoli, leaving a massive crater. Saif al-Arab Gadhafi is one of two sons of the Libyan leader whose names begin with Saif. Another son -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- had previously touted reform, but has emerged as one of his father's most visible defenders in recent months. The commander of the NATO operation, Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, said NATO was aware of ""unconfirmed media reports"" that members of Gadhafi's family had been killed in an airstrike. ""We regret all loss of life, especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict,"" said Bouchard, a Canadian air force general. But he said all targets ""are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals."" But Russia, which has criticized the allied campaign, said it had ""serious doubts"" about NATO's assertion that it is not targeting Gadhafi and his family. ""The disproportional use of force, all the more so, beyond the mandate of U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 1973, which in no way stipulates the replacement of the Libyan leadership, is leading to harmful consequences and the death of civilians,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official RIA Novosti news agency. ""We are again calling for strict compliance with the provisions of the decisions made by the international community on the Libyan conflict, for an immediate cease-fire and the start of a political settlement without any preconditions."" The airstrikes started March 19, after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians demanding the ouster of the ruler, who has been in power for nearly 42 years. A senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said the U.S. government is ""very aware"" of the reports of Gadhafi's son's death, but cannot confirm who, if anyone, died in a strike until they see the evidence. Gunfire broke out around Tripoli after the news came out. A crowd of demonstrators gathered around the ruler's compound. Images on Libyan state TV showed what appeared to be dozens of people chanting and waving flags. Protesters could be heard yelling, ""We want to redeem the martyr,"" and, ""Oh youth, this is time for jihad."" They were joined at one point by Ibrahim, who told the demonstrators, ""Every one of you are Saif al-Arab."" ""We will make Libya the grave of all invaders,"" he told the crowd. A spokesman for the Libyan opposition doubted the report of the death. ""In all honesty, we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising,"" said Hafiz Ghoga, deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi. ""We don't believe this is true,"" Ghoga said. ""It is all fabrications by the regime in a desperate attempt to get sympathy. ... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying."" Despite skepticism by some rebels, some opposition members celebrated the report of Saif al-Arab's death in the streets of Benghazi. Revelers danced and sang overnight as the sound of celebratory gunfire pierced through the air. ""By God, we're not supposed to rejoice anyone's death,"" one man told CNN. ""But we want him to feel the pain and sorrow that we're going through with our own people he killed."" Many of the reported civilian deaths have come out of the western city of Misrata. On Sunday, a witness there described especially intense shelling by government forces in the country's third-largest city and speculated that the intensified attacks were tied directly to reports of the death of Gadhafi's son. This is not the first time the ruler has reportedly been at the site of an airstrike that killed one of his children. In April 1986, his adopted daughter, Hanna Gadhafi, was killed when U.S. forces launched an airstrike that targeted his residential compound. At the time, U.S. President Ronald Reagan said the strikes were an act of self-defense following the bombing of a West Berlin, Germany, club that killed two American servicemen and injured several others.

"(CNN) -- Men sprawled on a tile floor, shirtless and convulsing. Children, too, seemingly unable to control their shaking and flailing. Panic and screams in the background. These are some of the hard-to-stomach images that the Obama administration has shown a select group of senators in closed-door briefings to make the case that a limited military attack on Syria is justified. CNN was the first to obtain the 13 different videos seen by members of the Senate Intelligence Committee that depict the gruesome scene of an chemical weapons attack in Syria on August 21. The administration told senators that their authenticity was verified by the intelligence community. The attack, allegedly carried out by Syrian forces under President Bashar al-Assad, has touched off the most critical foreign policy question since the uprising began in 2011: Is a military response merited? The videos capture a moment of panic, as those who are standing try to feed water to those who appear incapacitated. Prayers are repeated. What is sarin? Many of the videos were previously posted on YouTube, but this collection of footage is significant because the intelligence community has given it a stamp of authenticity. The footage could be vital in the administration's quest to convince Congress and the American public that the U.S. must launch punitive strikes against Syria, former U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson said. ""That video will sensitize the American people that this isn't just an intervention, that this is a military strike to stop that type of atrocity,"" the former congressman told CNN. While the videos are hard to watch, they do not prove who is responsible for the attack, nor do they provide an answer for whether military strikes are the correct course. President Barack Obama favors limited intervention, and his administration has been working nonstop to convince allies in Europe and lawmakers back home for support. Hours after CNN obtained and broadcast portions of the videos, the Senate Intelligence Committee posted them on its website for public viewing. An aide to Dianne Feinstein, the committee's chairwoman, said it's expected the video will be played Monday at a briefing for all House members. Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and National Security Adviser Susan Rice will be among those representing the Obama administration at that hearing and one Wednesday for senators, according to the White House. Based on her attendance at closed-door briefings, Feinstein has decided to vote in favor of the measure to intervene militarily in Syria, defying the wishes of many of her constituents. ""What's coming in is overwhelmingly negative,"" Feinstein said Thursday about the feedback from voters. ""There's no question about that. But you see, then they don't know what I know."" The availability of these videos obtained by CNN means that anyone can see at least part of the administration's evidence and come to their own conclusions. One video shows a room with enough children to fill a classroom, but they are arranged on the ground, the bright colors of their shirts -- red, yellow, green, purple, blue -- contrasting the paleness of their dead bodies. There were dead adults placed in this space, too. The video captures at least six rows of adults with no less than four bodies each. Sheets and blankets cover some of the bodies. In another video, a man uses a manual resuscitator on a toddler, who appears motionless. Another man comes with a bottled water and the men together try to rinse the small boy's face. It looks like the boy's chest moves, but his arms remain pinned to his side like a soldier at attention. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the videos. But officials have a number of reasons as to why they believe they are authentic. The videos were shot from multiple angles, providing overlap, not just in what could be seen but what could be heard, the administration officials told the senators. Why use chemical weapons? CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","NEW: The Senate Intelligence Committee posted the videos on its website .

"Washington (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama addressed the nation in the hours following Monday's Boston Marathon bombing, he did not use the word ""terror,"" immediately raising questions. When he took the podium at the White House less than 24 hours later, his phrasing changed. But he still was very careful about what he said, making separate points. ""Any time bombs are used to target civilians, it is an act of terrorism,"" Obama said. He said it was unclear who carried out the attack and why, but that the Boston bombings were a ""heinous and cowardly act"" that the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism. The two bomb blasts near the downtown finish line of the storied marathon killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and sent more than 170 others to local hospitals, some with critical injuries. With developments unfolding late on Monday, Obama spoke to the nation from the White House, saying ""we still do not know who did this or why"" and cautioning Americans against jumping to any conclusions. ""But make no mistake, we will get to the bottom of this and we will find out who did this. We'll find out why they did this,"" he said. Obama, calling attack 'terror,' shifts to response . Though Obama didn't mention ""terror,"" federal investigators and a White House official later classified the bombings as such. Those close to the case have said it is not clear whether the attack was domestic or foreign in origin. It makes sense Obama would be cautious in his initial public remarks and then clarify matters later with more information known, said Aitan Goelman, a former assistant U.S. attorney who helped prosecute the Oklahoma City bombing case. ""The president is absolutely right in cautioning people we don't know who did this,"" Goelman said. 'Boston will overcome,' mayor vows amid bombing investigation . Careful decision-making in communicating information to the public seems to reflect lessons learned by a chief executive who has had to navigate the aftermath of attacks or threatened attacks where American lives were lost or threatened. ""There were three attacks in the first 17 months of the administration, four if you count Fort Hood,"" said Matthew Miller, who served as a director of the Office of Public Affairs for the Justice Department during Obama's first term. ""What we learned in dealing with each of those is it's important for government officials to communicate early and reassure the public,"" he said. The president learned that lesson on Christmas Day in 2009 when a passenger attempted to detonate a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard an international flight heading into Detroit. The White House called it an attempted terrorist attack and it took Obama three days to address the incident publicly, delay that some Republicans in Congress criticized. A thwarted attempt to detonate explosives in New York's subway system in September 2009, the November 2009 shooting massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, and a failed bombing of New York's Times Square in May 2010 offered valuable lessons on communicating early, often and cautiously, Miller said. The administration has also benefited from consistency in staffing. Key officials, including White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who in 2009 served as National Security Council chief of staff, and homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco, who formerly served as a senior Justice Department official, are at Obama's side now. The administration also learned a tough political lesson around the word terror when Obama was hesitant to say it outright when first describing the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last September. Details emerge: Boston bombs may have involved pressure cooker, timer . The president did call the attack one of several ""acts of terror."" The administration's reluctance to clearly label that attack terrorism and comments blaming events initially on a response to an anti-Islamic film ignited partisan bickering and an election-year showdown with Republicans over his administration's handling of the matter. Politics aside, experts point out that classifying an attack as terrorism carries important legal and investigative meaning. ""You know, there's been much discussing about the parsing of words: is this terrorism, isn't it terrorism, it's criminal? First of all, terrorism is a crime. So it's automatically a criminal case if it's a terrorism case,"" said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN contributor. ""But secondly, if it was not terrorism, the FBI would not be in charge. It would be Boston P.D. running this case. So it's clear the authorities are absolutely clear. This is a terrorism investigation. It's a terrorism case,"" he said.","President Barack Obama uses word ""terror"" in latest comments on Boston bombings .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has struggled to contain ethnic tensions in the far northwest region of Xinjiang, recently launching a crackdown after a series of violent attacks left hundreds dead in recent months. But authorities think they may have found a new tonic to mend the cultural differences between the region's indigenous Uyghurs -- a mostly Muslim, Turkic-speaking group -- and China's dominant ethnic group, the Han Chinese. Her name is Ipal Khan. The wide-eyed Uyghur beauty is the protagonist of an upcoming cartoon based on the well-known tale of a girl from the city of Kashgar who captivated China's Qianlong Emperor with her good looks and sweet fragrance in the 18th century and became his concubine. According to the legend most Chinese are familiar with, the girl fell in love with the emperor and became his cherished consort. ""She is a figure that has contributed much to cross-cultural communication,"" Deng Jianglei, director of the cartoon, ""Princess Fragrant,"" told CNN. The animation is set to become a television series at the end of 2015, and a film the following year. Deng's company, Shenzhen Qianheng Cultural Communication Company, won a tender to create the 3-D animation last year, as part of a campaign by Xinjiang authorities to promote social harmony among China's different ethnic groups and raise awareness of the folk customs of the Uyghurs. During a visit to the province in June, Deng and his colleagues were inspired by the natural beauty and rich culture of Xinjiang -- a region the size of Iran that shares borders with eight countries. ""The cultures there and the folk arts are exquisite. But the place's economy is less developed. So we wanted ... to help them promote their cultures,"" he said. But appealing to both Han and Uyghur audiences may prove a challenge. Princess or sex slave? Selecting a musician to compose the theme song, for example, took over a year, China's Global Times reports, because it was difficult to find a composer who was familiar with both Han and Uyghur traditions. Then there are the alternative versions of the Uyghur girl's story. Although the legend of Fragrant Concubine has become a symbol of national unity for many Chinese, modern Uyghur interpretations of the tale portray her as an imperial sex slave who was murdered by the emperor's mother after stubbornly rejecting the emperor's advances. Deng said he wants the series to be entertaining while also fulfilling ""political needs."" ""(The cartoon) is a re-understanding of the friendship between Han and Uyghurs, which is especially significant to the re-education of the children and teaching them to accept different cultures."" His animation company, working in collaboration with the government of Kashgar, has plans to show the cartoon in China and abroad, especially in Islamic regions. Xinjiang has a long history of ethnic unrest. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han Chinese in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment by security forces, discrimination and a lack of economic opportunities. Muslim separatists have been held responsible for a series of recent deadly attacks, with Chinese authorities launching an anti-terror campaign in May. Measures to end the violence have ranged from executing convicted terrorists to banning beards and Islamic dress in some areas. But authorities have not ignored the role of soft power. ""It is similar as fighting a war in the realm of ideology. If we don't pass on positive energy, the opposite side would occupy the battlefield,"" Sheng Jun, a deputy director of cultural industry office at the Xinjiang Bureau of Culture told The Global Times. Finding common ground, however, was difficult even among the animators. Some of the more conservative Xinjiang artists who were consulted in the making of the cartoon objected to the use of animal characters because of the negative connotations associated with some creatures like snakes according to Islamic traditions, and because Uyghur families rarely own pets, the Global Times reports. ""The difficulty is that you have to respect history and culture while catering to the market,"" Deng said. When it came to the animals, Deng insisted they should stay. ""It's all about compromise,"" he said. Intern Linda Yan contributed to this report.","New cartoon seeks to foster cultural understanding between ethnic groups in Xinjiang region .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people are fleeing violence in Myanmar only to be robbed, beaten and starved on boats helmed by human traffickers, according to a new report from the United Nations Refugee Agency. In the 12 months to June, around 53,000 people left ports in the Myanmar-Bangladesh border area -- 61% more than the previous year -- many with the hope of reaching family in Malaysia, according to the report ""Irregular Maritime Movements."" They paid between $50 and $300 to board boats carrying up to 700 passengers, some manned by armed guards, many of whom doled out verbal abuse or beatings to prevent their human cargo from moving around. Some passengers were fed rice and noodles, while others received nothing at all on journeys lasting anywhere from seven days to two months, the report said. More than 200 people are thought to have died making the trip so far this year, due to illness, heat, lack of food and water, and severe beatings. However, the number of people who have perished at sea appears to have fallen over the past year, the report noted, after people smugglers hired bigger, more seaworthy vessels. Persecution in Myanmar . That so many people, the vast majority Rohingya Muslims, are rushing to flee the country is a scathing indictment of the conditions they're being forced to endure in Myanmar, or Burma, as it's also known. Of around 800,000 Rohingya Muslims living in Rakhine State, violence has pushed around 140,000 into temporary camps, while another 40,000 are effectively detained in isolated villages, according to Human Rights Watch. ""It's a humanitarian disaster,"" said HRW's Phil Robertson, who said conditions had worsened, especially since February, when the government barred international aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) from working in Rakhine State. The ban was lifted in late July but aid is yet to reach tens of thousands of people, many who are hungry and suffering preventable illnesses in crowded, unhygienic camps. ""What you're seeing is people who are leaving Rakhine State with very frail health to start with; people who have been in these camps and face the slow deprivation of food and basic medical services to the point that they're already weakened,"" Robertson said. ""They're getting on these boats, and these boats are landing in Thailand, and they're being put in jungle camps where they're on starvation rations unless their relatives can find exorbitant fees that the traffickers are demanding to release them and send them onto Malaysia."" The U.N. report said upon arrival in Thailand, new arrivals said they were driven through the night in pickups with 15 to 20 other people who were forced to sit or lie on top of one another. They were then taken to camps where hundreds of people, including women and children, were held while smugglers phoned family members abroad, demanding more money for their loved ones' safe passage to Malaysia. Demands ""were accompanied by threats or, when payment was not immediate, severe beating and prolonged detention in a smugglers' camp for up to six months,"" the report said. Malnourished in Malaysia . As many as 38,000 people had registered as Rohingya in Malaysia, the report said, noting that since 2013, many had arrived with serious medical conditions. In the first half of this year, more than 140 people had been diagnosed with beriberi, a condition caused by severe malnutrition and vitamin B deficiency, which can cause paralysis and death. That's 12 times the number diagnosed in the previous 14 months. ""They have faced deprivation, abuse and suffering every step of their way as they try to flee the predations of the Burmese government, and the local state government and the Rakhine state government,"" Robertson said. Myanmar doesn't recognize the Rohingya as citizens or as one of the predominantly Buddhist country's ethnic minorities. ""I think the international community really has to push very hard on the Burmese government to accept the reality that these people should be considered citizens of Burma. ""For the government of Burma to maintain this fiction that somehow these are recently arrived migrants from India or from Bangladesh is absolutely unconscionable,"" Robertson added. In a statement following their five-day visit to Myanmar last week, two commissioners from the U.S. Commission on Religious Freedom said they were ""deeply troubled by reports we received of abuses against the Rohingya Muslim community in Rakhine State."" ""No impartial observers question reports of systematic, large-scale and egregious abuses of human rights of this community involving acts and omissions resulting in deaths, injuries, displacement, denial of basic health and other services, denial of freedom of movement, and denial of the right to a nationality, among other violations,"" said Commissioners M. Zudhi Jasser and Eric P. Schwartz. In the past few years, Myanmar's new leadership under President Thein Sein has won praise for its efforts to open the once reclusive country to foreign influences and trade. However its treatment of the Rohingya continues to cloud its stated commitment to improving human rights.","More than 50,000 people have fled Myanmar-Bangladesh border ports .

"Santa Barbara, California (CNN) -- As Elliot Rodger was carrying out a deadly rampage Friday night around Santa Barbara, his parents were frantically trying to find him, having just received a chilling manifesto from their son. Rodger, 22, sent a couple dozen people -- including his parents and at least one of his therapists -- the 140-page document via e-mail not long before the shootings began, Simon Astaire, a family friend, told CNN. The manifesto is a lengthy chronicle detailing Rodger's frustrations with his height, his parents' divorce and rejection by women. It was obtained by the media on Saturday, but it was not known then that his family had seen the document before the rampage. Rodger's mother, Lichin, who saw the e-mail at 9:17 p.m. PT, immediately went to Rodger's YouTube page, where he had been known to post videos about himself. According to Astaire, that's when Rodger's mother saw her son's latest video, called ""Retribution,"" that he posted Friday, the day of the shootings. In the video, Rodger outlined his plan of ""slaughtering"" women at a sorority house at the University of California at Santa Barbara. His mother called Rodger's father, Peter, and said he had to watch the YouTube video. At the time, Peter Rodger had not yet seen the manifesto. Lichin Rodger called 911, and the parents set off for Santa Barbara from Los Angeles, according to Astaire. En route, they heard there was a shooting. Later that night, they found out their son was behind the violence. Authorities say the killing rampage left six victims dead and 13 injured. It ended when Rodger slammed into a parked vehicle and apparently shot himself in the head, police said. Who were the victims? There had been warning signs that Rodgers was struggling with mental health. His mother came across his YouTube videos in April after she hadn't heard from Rodger in a few days, Astaire said. She called one of his therapists, who then called a Santa Barbara mental health hotline. A woman on the hotline called police to check on him, Astaire said. Six policemen showed up at his house in Isla Vista on April 30, but they found nothing alarming, so they told Rodger to call his mother and they reassured her that he was OK, according to Astaire. Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters Saturday that at the time, deputies ""determined he did not meet the criteria for an involuntary hold."" Looking back, Rodger's parents now feel that the well-being check in April by police was a ""pivotal moment,"" and his parents are frustrated, Astaire said. He described it as a ""missed opportunity"" to really find out what was going on with Rodger, but his parents admit that hindsight is always easy, Astaire said. In fact, Elliot Rodger himself wrote in the manifesto that he worried that someone had discovered his plan when the police visited. ""I had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning to do, and reported me for it,"" he wrote. ""If that was the case, the police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can't imagine a hell darker than that."" He continued: ""If they had demanded to search my room ... That would have ended everything. For a few horrible seconds I thought it was all over. When they left, the biggest wave of relief swept over me."" Brown told reporters that Rodger suffered from an undisclosed mental health issue and was under the care of a variety of health care professionals. On Sunday, the sheriff defended the April welfare check, saying on CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley"" that getting involved in mental health cases is a ""delicate balance."" ""You want to certainly intervene and obviously try to prevent a tragedy such as we've experienced here. On the same token, you don't want to stigmatize people who are seeking treatment for mental illness and you don't want to prevent them from doing so because of the potential stigma that's attached,"" he said. ""It's a double-edged sword in some respects."" Rodger had been seeing therapists on and off since he was 8, according to Astaire. He went to high school in Van Nuys, California, and met with a therapist ""pretty much every day,"" Astaire said. Before his death, Rodger was seeing two therapists, Astaire added. ""(Rodger) has always been going to see someone,"" he said, describing him as ""reserved to a daunting degree."" But Astaire said Rodger didn't seem to have violent tendencies. In fact, there was no recent indication Rodger was growing increasingly distant or that his condition was deteriorating, Astaire added. Rodger's father said a week ago that Rodger seemed to be doing well ""at the moment."" On Thursday, he spoke to his father and said he was looking forward to seeing his family this weekend. Astaire told CNN that Rodger never expressed any fascination with guns. ""Guns were never part of the dialogue,"" he said. Inside Rodger's car Friday night police found three handguns -- all legally purchased -- and more than 400 rounds of unused ammunition. Rodger passed the background check needed to buy the firearm used in the shooting, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN. The official said nothing had been found in the gun trace to indicate Rodger should have been disqualified. Astaire also mentioned a feud that Rodger had had recently with his roommates, saying Rodger complained to his landlord that his roommates were too noisy and played lots of video games. Rodger suggested they move out but was told that couldn't happen. ""(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health,"" Astaire said. ""They thought he was in good hands."" But ""in a moment of indescribable grief,"" he said, they are ""of course asking themselves, 'Did we do as much as we can do?'"" CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","Elliot Rodger's mother read his manifesto, alerted his father, and they set out to find him .

"(CNN) -- Outspoken Australian billionaire tycoon and politician Clive Palmer has apologized for his verbal attack on China during a television interview last week, when he called Chinese people ""mongrels"" who ""shoot their own people."" The leader of the Palmer United Party was appearing on Australian television channel ABC when he was asked about the Chinese state-owned company he is locked in a dispute with. They're ""bastards,"" he said. ""I'm saying that because they're Communist, because they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country [Australia]."" He later clarified that his comments were meant for the company rather than the Chinese people or their government -- though Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qin Gang was unimpressed and described Palmer's words as ""totally irrational and absurd."" Apology . Then in a letter to China's ambassador to Australia Monday, Palmer apologized for his remarks. ""I regret any hurt or anguish such comments may have caused any party and I look forward to greater understanding for peace and cooperation in future,"" he wrote. ""I now come to the realization that what I said on Q&A was an insult to Chinese people everywhere and I wish to assure them they have my most genuine and sincere apology."" He then went on to emphasize his links with China, before referencing Mao Zedong, China's late paramount leader. ""I have had a long involvement with China since first visiting the country in 1962. As Chairman Mao said in Nanjing when celebrating the 45th anniversary of the 1911 Revolution, words to the effect that over 45 years have passed since the 1911 Revolution and China had only sought friendly relations with its neighbors. ""He went on to say that another 45 years would pass and China would continue to seek good relations with its relations and China has. It is in the interest of the whole world that Australia and China have good relations."" In response, China's ambassador to Australia, Ma Zhaoxu, said any remarks that attacked or slandered China would not gain popular support and were doomed to fail, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday. ""The healthy and stable relationship between China and Australia is in the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, and cannot be hindered by any individual,"" he said.","Clive Palmer called Chinese people ""mongrels"" during an interview on Australian television .

"(Budget Travel) -- Just because you watch ""Jersey Shore"" or -- worse -- were a member of the David Hasselhoff International Fan Club doesn't mean you really know what it's like to be a lifeguard. To find out, we went to the source: a veteran whistle-blower at a New Jersey beach. Enjoy your swimming! The money is terrible . Lifeguard season is about four months long, from mid-May to September. First-year guards make about $10 an hour -- not much -- and we pay a lot of money to live in a house down on the shore. But it's the summertime -- you gotta enjoy it. We work hard . We actually work a lot harder than most people think. I've done more than 60 rescues now, in six years. Sometimes, a group of 30 or more people will all get swept out by a riptide at once. I can bring in five people at a time, if I have a buoy, and two people if I don't. And I can get 10 to 15 guards to come help me within a minute or two. I've only lost two people, and they were swimming after hours. It was the worst riptide I'd ever seen. Awful. Budget Travel: 10 affordable beachfront resorts . Hot or not? We talk about everybody on the beach . Of course we talk about everybody on the beach -- any flaw in any person. We buy our own walkie-talkie radios and communicate that way, about hot girls and everyone else who's not so hot. We always get these big, old French-Canadian guys who wear tiny thongs. It's a long day sitting in the chair. You have to entertain yourself. You don't want to know where we go to the bathroom . We pee in the water just like everybody else -- some of the guards even go No. 2 in there. It's quicker than walking up to the bathrooms on the boardwalk. But we don't always want to get wet, so most of us pee without even leaving our chair. There's a technique to it. You know how most guards wear sweatpants? That's because it's easier to hide a Gatorade bottle in sweats than in shorts. You just stick the bottle down there and pee in it. We party hard . We lifeguards have this motto: ATF, or Alive 'Til Five. It's our goal for the night. We get off of work at 5:30 p.m. Then we usually drink at the house before heading to the bars at 1 a.m. After they close, we go home around 3:30 a.m. and drink a few cases of beer until 5 a.m. I'm an old man of 24 now, so I usually fall asleep by 3 a.m. -- and I always get heckled for it. Budget Travel: Confessions of...a cruise ship musician . Some lifeguards sleep on the job . I party, but I'm a total worrywart, and I take my job seriously; no matter how hard I go out the night before, I'm always at work when our day officially starts, at 9:30 a.m. I never fall asleep on the job, especially with all the caffeine and tobacco in my system. But I know guys who will sleep for five hours straight up in the chair. They have their tricks. Some will roll a towel up, wrap it around their neck, and then tuck the ends between their legs to keep themselves from falling out of the chair. Others will wear a big sweatshirt and then hide an apple or orange under their chin, so it looks like they're looking straight ahead at the water. Sex on the beach -- it happens more than you might think . I have to break up a lot of fights, mostly high school kids. No one's allowed to drink on the beach, but everyone does -- even the lifeguards on their days off. And, of course, it's illegal to have sex on the beach, but I always catch people doing it in the water. To be frank, I know a few lifeguards who have. But I always blow the whistle and put a stop to it, not just because it's illegal. It's a decency thing.

"(CNN) -- The streaking ball of fire Friday night above the East Coast did not, alas, signal the end to civilization as we know it. Though you might get that sense from social media. The sky lit up along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard with reports of ""a thin streak of blue-greenish-white"" from people like Chip Guy, who was driving in eastern Maryland when he and his family he spotted it. ""It didn't last more than eight or nine seconds, then it disappeared,"" said Guy, a spokesman for Sussex County, Delaware. ""Frankly, I didn't think too much of it."" But his tune changed once he posted something about the presumed meteor on a local social media web page, which triggered a quick and hearty response. Welcome to the year of the comet . That was just the tip of the online iceberg. Through Friday night, new reports of meteor sightings appeared every few seconds on Twitter, some of them from the metropolises of New York City and Washington. ""OMG I saw a real meteor in the Brooklyn's sky,"" wrote one person on Twitter, with the handle Curious Sergey. ""It's all over the news now! I thought it is some kind of firework..."" The Federal Aviation Administration fielded calls about a meteor from Virginia to Maine, said agency spokeswoman Arlene Salac. So what exactly was it? Michael Kucharek, a spokesman for NORAD, said his agency heard about the sightings, too, and can confirm it was not from anything man-made, such as a plane or falling satellite. On Saturday, Bill Cooke from NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office explained that the bright, fast-flying object was, in fact, a meteor. The space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory defines a meteor as ""light phenomena"" from a meteoroid -- which is itself a comet or asteroid orbiting the sun -- that ""enters the Earth's atmosphere and vaporizes."" It made for quite a show, producing a fireball as bright as a full moon and spurring more than 630 visual reports to be submitted to the American Meteor Society, as it soared southwest into the Atlantic Ocean. But just because it was bright doesn't mean it was big. The meteor was one yard in diameter, about the size of an exercise ball, when it entered the atmosphere over eastern Pennsylvania, said Cooke. That's still big enough potentially to produce meteorites -- which are meteoroids, or fragments thereof, that do manage to hit the Earth -- before burning completely. If it did, though, they fell harmlessly into the Atlantic, according to Cooke. As anyone who has seen a shooting star can attest, it's hardly unprecedented for otherworldly objects to enter the Earth's atmosphere. And some of them do strike our planet, though they tend to be small when they do and strike unpopulated areas on land or plunge into the world's oceans. There are exceptions, like the massive asteroid that many experts believe killed off dinosaurs. More recently, a meteor exploded over the steppes of southwestern Russia on February 15, a blast that scientists at Canada's University of Western Ontario estimated had the energy of about 30 early nuclear bombs. The related flash and boom shattered glass in buildings and left about 1,000 people hurt, authorities said. There were no confirmed reports Friday night that the greenish streak spotted by so many actually impacted anywhere. Even if it didn't, the mere possibility was enough to send chills down some stargazers' spines. ""Seriously, after that massive meteor in california a few weeks ago, the one that hit russia, and now this hugee one tonight,"" wrote a Twitter user by the name of Olivia, referring to the Russia incident and a mass shooting star sighting on the West Coast last night.
