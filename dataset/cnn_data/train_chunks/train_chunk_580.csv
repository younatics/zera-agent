This picture of Mark Duper was released by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office after he was arrested and charged wth allegedly beating his son . American football star Mark Duper has been released from jail on bond after allegedly beating up his 17-year-old son in a domestic row. The former Miami Dolphins player faces a felony child abuse charge after assaulting his teenage son and knocking him out during a series of fights at their Florida home. The wide receiver, who starred for the Dolphins from 1982 to 1992, spent a night in jail after his arrest on Wednesday following the assault the day before. Authorities say Duper attacked his son Marcus three times and knocked him out twice. Duper has reportedly admitted there was an altercation but said he was acting in self-defense. It was reported that the argument began with a row over a text Duper's son had sent to an ex-girlfriend. During the row, Duper allegedly asked his son to pick a hat off the floor and punched him in the face when he 'wouldn't listen', according to the arrest report quoted in the Miami Herald. The report claims Duper picked his son up and body-slammed him, knocking him unconscious. The fight is then said to have calmed down before escalating again, with Duper allegedly 'hitting the child in the head and face with his fist'. Later, the fight started up again when the boy is said to have dented his father's car with his bike, and Duper allegedly punched him in the face. The Herald reports the police report: 'Once [the victim] went to the ground on his stomach, Mark climbed on top of [him], grabbed [him] by the neck and began choking.' Mark Duper is seen here in 1988 getting caught from behind by Green Bay Packers' Mark Lee during an NFL game in Miami . Duper was arrested on Wednesday after . police were alerted to the boy's injuries, which included a cut lip, . scratches, and a knot on his forehead. He was questioned and spent a night in jail before being released on bond, and police notified the Department of Children and Families. Duper, nicknamed Super Duper, played 11 seasons for the Dolphins, the best being 1984 and 1986.","Mark Duper, 54, faces child felony abuse charge after row at Florida home .

After a string of horse deaths over the last ten years, this week's Grand National will now be run over new plastic fences in the hope of making the course less dangerous. Last year joint favourite Synchronised and outsider . According to Pete had to be put down after falling . at the sixth fence of the Grand National, the infamous Becher's Brook at Aintree racecourse, Liverpool. The deaths led to public outcry and calls from animal welfare groups for the Grand National . to be banned. Scroll down for video . Outcry: According to Pete injured himself during the 2012 Grand National falling over the old birch barrier and had to be put down . Infamous: The new Becher's Brook fence at Aintree racecourse no longer has a hard birch core but has been covered by spruces so it will not affect the appearance of the course . Aintree has responded to criticism by introducing several safeguards to help make the demanding course more horse-friendly. The most important change will be the fences, which have seen many dangerous falls in the past. Aintree managing director John Baker said: ‘The fences . will look the same. The idea is to make the core . softer.' When the spruce is knocked off, the wooden core may possibly . have contributed to injury.' The fences will remain the same height so this year's race should be safer but not any easier. Horse-friendly: The more forgiving plastic frame in place for this year's Grand National .

'The old fences were unique to Aintree,' he . said. 'They were completely solid and four or five wooden posts deep. He explained: 'If a horse hit them, it would be catapulted into almost a somersault. I . pushed very hard to have them taken away.

I simply don't think the . public will tolerate another National like the ones we've had the last . few years.' 'To many inside the racing industry, the death of Synchronised was a final moment to say, 'It has got to change''. One of the more controversial changes is moving the start 90 yards . forward so that the horses will not be so worked up when they start. The noisy grandstand can agitate some horses, causing them to bolt out from the start to the first fence.

Staff at a zoo in South Africa are watching their step after a highly dangerous snake escaped from its enclosure. Pretoria Zoo's black mamba - one of the fastest and most venomous snakes in the world - is believed to be hiding somewhere in the zoo grounds after it was reported missing over a week ago. Now, desperate staff at the zoo in South Africa's capital are using infra-red cameras in a bid to find the six-and-a-half foot (two metre) missing reptile - before it finds one of them. South Africa's most feared snake: Pretoria Zoo's black mamba is missing from its enclosure . Marketing manager Craig Allenby said he hoped the snake was hiding in the roof of a service building behind its terrarium. Staff have placed snacks of rats, mice and chicks in the service area in a bid to tempt the snake out, but it has yet to bite. Mr Allenby's team is using cameras which can pick up radiation emitted by bodies and even objects as cold-blooded as killer snakes. Another theory is that the snake may have been stolen.  Zoo staff say there is a trade for indigenous reptiles such as Houdini, as they have named the missing mamba. However despite the uncertainty over the snake's whereabouts, a Friday night zoo tour and sleepover at the attraction are still going to go ahead - albeit at a distance from the snake enclosure, and with guards on hand. Mr Allenby told Sowetan Live: 'We would like to assure the public of our utmost commitment to resolving this issue as quickly as possible. Black mambas can kill lions with just one bite thanks to the powerful venom in their fangs . 'There is no additional threat to the public.' The Easter Egg hunts planned for Easter weekend will also go ahead.  Hundreds of children are expected to flock to the zoo to hunt for 20,000 chocolate eggs. Bites from the black mamba nearly always result in the victim's death. Black mambas are known as Africa's most feared snakes, and with good reason.  Just two drops of their venom can kill a human, and they have up to 20 drops in their fangs. The venom contains a fast-acting neurotoxin that paralyses and kills it prey.  Such is its strength, black mambas can kill a lion with just one bite.","Six-and-a-half foot snake has been missing from its enclosure for a week .

A woman went on a spending spree treating herself to a breast enhancement, motorbike and new car after her husband embezzled £100,000 from a building company, a court heard today. Rhianna Thomas, 24, allegedly spent more than £4,000 of the embezzled cash on breast surgery after her new husband Arron Thomas, 32, stole £99,243.62 from building company Grafton Merchanting. Today, prosecutor Robin Griffiths told Oxford Crown Court who Thomas drew up fake invoices and wrote cheques out under his wife's maiden name of Tucker - the same name as one of Grafton's suppliers. Rhianna Thomas, pictured on her wedding day with husband Arron, is accused of spending money he embezzled on plastic surgery and a new car . The jury was told that while Arron Thomas had admitted the fraud, his wife denies the charges against her. They heard that after the money started to flow into her account, Rhianna Thomas visited the Make Yourself Amazing (MYA) cosmetic surgery centre in Birmingham and booked a £4,250 operation to enhance her breast size. Finance director of MYA Cosmetic . Surgery, Martina Jackson, told the jury her company had performed the . defendant's breast enlargement. 'She wanted to have the operation as soon as possible and she paid the full amount for the procedure,' she said. Outlining the case, Mr Griffiths said that Arron Thomas registered with recruitment agency Hayes and requested work in an accounts department. He said Thomas was found work as a purchase ledger clerk at Grafton Merchanting in Oxford, working 37 and a half hours per week at an hourly rate of £8.34. Mr Griffiths said: 'The trial will be concerned with very large sums of money and the prosecution draws attention to the relatively modest scale of his legitimate earnings during that six-month period [of his employment]. 'The way it is believed to have worked is that Grafton Merchanting would submit weekly time sheets regarding hours he actually worked. Rhianna Thomas, left, and husband Arron, right, leaving Oxford Crown Court at a previous hearing . 'Hayes paid him by bank transfer into the account he nominated which was a NatWest account held in the name 'R Tucker'. 'It turns out R Tucker stood for Rhianna and the surname to which she had at the time. It was later to become Thomas when she married Arron in April 2011.' Invoices were made to a legitimate and entirely innocent company named Tuckers Glass and Windows. This totalled £36,679.98 on January 31, 2011.  Three other payments of £8,505, £29,895.67 and £24,162.97 then followed. The prosecutor added: 'Suppliers send an invoice to Graftons and any adjustment made if necessary before it's processed and then a cheque is printed and signed off. It is placed into an envelope and placed in the post room ready for dispatch. 'After Arron Thomas left that employment it was discovered that he had abused his position of trust there by manually raising requests for payments on the computer to a company which had submitted no invoices for the kind of sums of money for which he then used the system to issue cheques. 'This created a cover for the issue . of the cheque in these very large sums. The money - £99,243.62 - was . paid into the same NatWest bank account held in the name of R Tucker - . the name of this defendant.' Tuckers Glass and Windows was a small supplier to Graftons who usually submitted invoices for under £100. Mr . Griffiths said the couple embarked on a mammoth spending spree once the . illicit funds were in Rhianna Thomas' account, buying a Suzuki GSXR600 motorbike and Volvo C70 coupe. 'Virtually all the money was spent in a remarkably short amount of time,' he said. Rhianna . and Arron Thomas got married at Eynsham Hall in Oxfordshire on April . 29, 2011 - the same day heir to the throne Prince William wed Kate . Middleton at Westminster Abbey. The jury at Oxford Crown Court heard that Rhianna Thomas denies the charges of possessing and transferring criminal property . The following January, they were arrested at their Oxfordshire home and later charged by police with a string fraud-related offences. In a pre-prepared statement handed to . police upon her arrest, the defendant said: 'Arron has had use of my . personal bank account for most of our relationship. 'At . times he has had total control. I was aware large amounts had been paid . into my account. I was told by Arron that these were loans.' The statement went on: 'I . have not had any involvement in these amounts being paid into my . account in any way. Control and management of these loans was entirely . the responsibility of Arron Thomas. 'I was not aware of any thefts of cheques at any time.' The jury heard that Arron Thomas had already admitted four counts of fraud and three counts of transferring criminal property. He will be sentenced by a judge at the end of his wife's trial. Rhianna Thomas denies four counts of possessing criminal property and three counts of transferring criminal property between February and April, 2011. The couple, from Abingdon, are on conditional bail and the three-day trial, before Recorder Philip Brook Smith, continues.

Ghassan Hitto, the Syrian opposition's newly elected prime minister, says he has no intention of entering into dialogue with President Bashar al-Assad . He enjoys American football, has an American-born wife, and has spent the last 30 years bringing up four children in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas. But 50-year-old Ghassan Hitto is, as of yesterday, the new prime minister of the Syrian opposition National Coalition. And now the Syrian-born IT executive who follows the Dallas Cowboys has lofty ambitions: to bring stability and peace to the wartorn homeland he left as a teenager. Mr Hitto started as he means to go . on, with the bald statement: 'Our main goal is to bring about the . downfall of the Assad regime by all means and while providing the basic . services to our people on the inside.' He said he had no intention of trying to enter into dialogue with the Syrian president. The bespectacled father of four was chosen to run the opposition coalition, the main political grouping opposing President Bashar al-Assad, in an election held in Turkey, where he has been living, yesterday. The coalition was formed with Western and Gulf backing in Qatar last year to bring together Assad's political foes and build an alternative government structure to replace his rule. But after a brief period of harmony, divisions have racked the group, with its liberal minority accusing the powerful Muslim Brotherhood and its allies, who include a handful of Christians, of assuming control of the coalition. After a meeting in Istanbul yesterday, the coalition chose Mr Hitto, the Western-educated exile who is little known in Syria, as provisional prime minister.  He was elected with 35 out of 48 votes. Mr Hitto was backed by the Muslim . Brotherhood and opposition coalition Secretary General Mustafa Sabbagh, . who has strong links with Gulf Arab states, according to sources at the . meeting. However his . election was not to everyone's tastes, and nine people suspended their . membership of the Syrian National Coalition after Mr Hitto was named as . prime minister. Veteran opposition campaigner Walid . al-Bunni said: 'The Muslim Brotherhood, with the backing of Qatar, have . imposed their prime minister candidate. We will keep away if the . coalition does not reconsider its choice.' Ghassan Hitto says his main aim is to bring about the downfall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, pictured . Fans of Mr Hitto, who left Damascus in his teens to study in the US, has lived and worked in IT for nearly 30 years in Dallas, where he is a well-known member of the local Muslim community. He helped run an Islamic school, the Brighter Horizons Academy, in Texas, where three of his children have been educated, and where his wife, Suzanne, still works teaching English. But despite having built a life for himself in American, Mr Hitto remained committed to helping rebuild his homeland. Smoke billows from burning vehicles following a car bomb in Damascus last month: such attacks in war-torn Syria are a regular sight . Cheerleaders for the Dallas Cowboys: In his nearly-30 years living and working in the US, Mr Hitto became a firm fan of the team . Last year he quit his job, left Dallas and moved to Istanbul to 'join the ranks of the Syrian revolution'. Now he faces the challenge of uniting the opposition against the Assad regime and bringing stability to the fighting and poverty-ravaged rebel-held areas. Mr Hitto will also need to build, and raise, his profile in his native land - some are opposed to him on the grounds that he does not live there and hasn't for years. However his supporters say he is just what the country needs. Ahmad Abo Kayass, president of the Coalition for Free Syria, told The Times: 'His greatest qualities are leadership, he listens to people, and he is decisive and determined.' 'Some people are saying ""Who is this guy?"" but they will be really happy with him being the prime minister.'","Ghassan Hitto, 50, voted new head of Syrian National Coalition opposition .

A female vandal has daubed one of France's most iconic paintings with graffiti referring to the 9/11 terrorist attacks at the new Louvre museum in the northern city of Lens. The 28-year-old woman used a red permanent marker pen to scrawl 'AE911' in three-inch high letters on Eugene Delacroix’s 1830 masterpiece Liberty Leading the People - which dramatically depicts a bare-breasted woman raising the French flag against oppression. AE911 is the name of a website calling for an independent inquiry into the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and New York’s World Trade Centre. Vincent Pomarede (centre), director of the paintings department at the Louvre Museum, and Xavier Dectot (left), director of the Louvre-Lens Museum, speak to the media . The woman was immediately grabbed by security guards after she wrote on the painting on Thursday evening, and remained in custody on Friday. A specialist restorer was rushed to the scene and the Louvre believes that the inscription can be removed. Liberty Leading the People is one of France’s best-known images that represents popular resistance to tyranny. It had been loaned to the Louvre in Lens by the Paris Louvre to help launch the museum’s regional offshoot. Main attraction: Eugene Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People was defaced with a red marker pen . French President Francois Hollande next to the painting 'La Liberte Guidant le Peuple' by French artist Eugene Delacroix during the opening of the Louvre-Lens Museum in Lens, northern France . Guarded: A fireman stands in front of the closed gallery room after a Eugene Delacroix painting was damaged . Theories: The truth behind the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington have been disputed by conspiracy theorists . It is not clear exactly what the . woman's reasons were for attacking the artwork in the Lens Louvre but . the graffiti she daubed on the piece suggests she was making a political . point about the 9/11 terrorist attacks. There . are dozens of conspiracy theories claiming to explain the 'truth' behind the attacks floating around cyberspace, some of which are more . believable than others. Proponents . of these theories claim there are inconsistencies in the official . government conclusions, or evidence which was allegedly 'overlooked.' A . 2008 global poll of 16,063 people in 17 countries, 15% of those who . responded said they believed the US government was responsible while . seven per cent even claimed Israel was the culprit. One . of the most prominent conspiracy theories among self-proclaimed . 'truthers' is that the Twin Towers and number 7 World Trade Center were . destroyed in a controlled demolition rather than as a result of the . impact of the two aircraft and resultant fire. Others apparently believe the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the US. government. Some . also claim the authorities had pryer warning of the terrorist attacks . but deliberately failed to act on them, or even assisted the attackers. Critics claim the theories are simply a common, and misguided, response among sections of society to a traumatic global event. In 2009, a Russian woman tourist was arrested after hurling a mug at the world’s most famous painting the Mona Lisa, at Louvre in Paris. The mug which she had just bought in the gift shop bounced off the bullet-proof glass shielding the Mona Lisa and shattered on the floor, causing no damage. In 2007, another woman was prosecuted for kissing a 1.5 million pounds painting by American artist Cy Twombly and leaving a lipstick smudge on the canvas. She claimed in court that her act was an ‘artistic gesture’, telling the court: 'I just gave it a kiss. It was an act of love, I wasn’t thinking. I thought the artist would understand.' And in 2006, pensioner Pierre Pinocelli smashed a porcelain urinal - a modern ‘artwork’ by Marcel Duchamp - with a hammer. He told a court in Paris: 'I am not the cheap vandal that some would have me to be. I wanted to pay homage to the spirit of Dadaism, which is all about disrespect.'","Woman, 28, used a red marker pen to scrawl 'AE911' in 3in high letters .

The teenager told the court that as he had sex with the 31-year-old woman, her boyfriend Brian Ecclestone walked in and told him he was doing a good job. Ecclestone then got out his video camera and filmed the boy with his partner, Emmanie Hughes, Swansea Crown Court heard. Emmanie Hughes, 31 . Brian Ecclestone, 32 . Peter Sweetman, 32 . The jury heard how the boy had been dropped off by his mother at the home of family friend Iwan Walker, 24, who had invited him to spend the night.

She described the 13-year-old as 'muscular and confident', and said he appeared to know what he was doing. 'I thought he was older, he told me he was 16,' she told the court.  'I had no reason to doubt what he said.  He initiated sex; he was the first to ask me to go upstairs. Bryan came afterwards to see if he was ok.' And she told police during interview: 'I am not in the habit of asking for ID.' She added: 'Brian filmed. He (the boy) filmed as well', and told the court she later had sex with Sweetman and Walker. Walker told the court he had exchanged text messages with Ecclestone a few days before about having sex with Hughes, but had never met her before that night. He agreed that one text from Ecclestone read: 'Come and bang her, mate. Shall I get her showered for you?' 'I knew the offer was there', he told the jury. Walker said that once inside Ecclestone's house, he thought the boy and Hughes had gone upstairs to 'have a chat'. He said that after a while he went to the bedroom to see Hughes naked but the boy clothed. Later again, he went upstairs and had sexual intercourse with Hughes for several hours. Sweetman told the court he had sex with Hughes from time to time with Ecclestone's knowledge. The jury at Swansea Crown Court heard that defendants Hughes and Ecclestone had been swinging since 2010 . Ecclestone told the jury he and Hughes had been swinging since 2010.

I was happy for them to have sex,' he said. 'She found it quite flattering, to be honest.' The boy said the suggestions he had said he was 16 and had asked to lose his virginity with Hughes were not true. Hughes and Ecclestone, both of Llandysul, Sweetman, of Newcastle Emlyn, and Walker, of Saron, all deny inciting a child under . 16 to engage in sexual activity with Hughes.  Hughes denies a further charge of sexual activity with a child.

Daredevil: Cameron Peacock, 14, travels more than ten miles a week getting to lessons on his unicycle . The 14-year-old schoolboy, who lives in Roseworth, Stockton-on-Tees, says he likes to be different, and considers the strange looks he gets as he travels to his lessons every morning as part of the fun. He said: 'I still get sarcastic comments from some people, who shout 'You've lost half your bike' or 'Give us a wheelie'. 'Lots of car drivers beep their horns when they see me, and most make a joke, but if it is an old person they tend to shout a bit.' Cameron says he is used to motorists shouting at him as he cycles to school . Cameron, a pupil at Bishopsgarth School in Stockton-on-Tees, learnt his unusual skill at JUST (Juggling Unicycling Stockton-on-Tees), and says he likes to be different. He said: 'I like to be unique and it keeps me fit and healthy. 'Obviously, riding a unicycle is more tricky than riding a conventional bike but it is not as difficult as people think: everyone can do it if they put their mind to it. 'It took me about two-and-a-half hours of practice before I was able to cycle five metres, and a week of practice before I could cycle constantly. 'I love doing trialling on my unicycles, which means I do tricks like jumping on ramps. 'I don't know exactly what I want to do in the future, but at the moment I would like to be the best I possibly can be at unicycling. I want to be number one in the UK.' Cameron has eight unicycles and spends his free time doing stunts on them, as well as taking them on cross-country tracks. His mother, Claire Peacock, 42, is used to her son's preferred mode of transport, but says she worries about the reactions of others. She said: 'I'm surprised he hasn't ever caused a crash, as motorists stare at him open-mouthed. 'I was quite worried when Cameron first started riding his unicycle to school, but I worry less now, and am just very proud of him. 'He had more accidents on his normal bike than he's ever had on his unicycle, and he is in complete control of it.' Off to school: Cameron Peacock has been going to lessons on his unicycle for two years . Mrs Peacock said Cameron was never into football like other boys, and got into unicycling at 11.  He now spends all his pocket money on unicycles, and is the sixth best trial rider in the country. Later this year Cameron, who lives with his mother, father Jeffrey, 46, a self-employed haulage contractor, and brother Matthew, 18, will be taking part in various competitions at the British Juggling Convention, and he hopes to be named the best trial unicyclist in the country. Bishopsgarth School headteacher Sue Cain said: 'Cameron has shared his skills and talents with his year group in assemblies, and we have all been wowed by his expertise in using the unicycle. 'We strive to see all of our students develop a wide range of skills and knowledge both in and out of the classroom, and Cameron has shown that we can all be the best we can be in our chosen field.'

Moreton's solicitor told Northampton Crown Court the defendant had 'demonstrated some poor thinking skills' Moreton, who lists herself as an estate agent on her Facebook page, was handed a four-month jail term, suspended for two years, for perverting the course of justice and 14 days in prison, suspended for the same period, for the driving offences. Judge Lynn Tayton told Moreton the only reason she was not imposing an immediate custodial sentence was for the welfare of her four-year-old son. She said: 'I think you've been utterly manipulative, arrogant and stupid, and if you come back before this court you can expect very different treatment. 'The picture I'm getting here is somebody who seems to think it's perfectly all right to drive without insurance and pretend she is just dippy.' Judge Lynn Tayton said Moreton had been 'utterly manipulative, arrogant, and stupid' Judge Tayton also drew parallels with the case of disgraced Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce who were both jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice. She told Moreton: 'You have seen the news the sentences imposed for this type of offence. 'One of the reasons these sentences are imposed is that the legal system depends on people giving a proper account for justice to be served.' Moreton was also banned from driving for three years, ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and given a six-month supervision order. She refused to comment outside court last Thursday.","Belinda Moreton told owner she would deny it to police by pretending to be stupid, Northampton Crown Court heard .

Two teenagers charged with shooting dead a 13-month-old baby in his stroller appeared in court on Monday. De'Marquise Elkins, 17, made his first court appearance in Brunswick, Georgia today, charged as an adult. Elkins and a 14-year-old boy, who has not been identified, are both charged over last Thursday's shooting of baby Antonio Santiago and the wounding of his mother, Sherry West. On trial for murder: De'Marquise Elkins, 17, appears in court on Monday over the death of a 13-month-old baby who was shot dead in Brunswick, Georgia . Murdered: Baby Antonio was shot in the head as he slept by two boys who attempted to rob his mother . Antonio died of a gunshot to the head . after a botched robbery by two teenagers while West was out for a walk . in the historic city. 'My client is absolutely, 1,000-percent not guilty,' public defender Kevin Gough, who represents Elkins said on Monday. Elkins is . charged as an adult with first-degree murder, along with a 14-year-old . who was not identified because he is a juvenile, Police Chief Tobe Green . said. At Monday morning's hearing, the 14-year-old came into the courtroom shackled and wearing a baggy orange jumpsuit. He glanced at the few members of the media allowed into the courtroom for the initial appearance as he shuffled to a lectern facing Glynn County Magistrate Tim Barton. The magistrate told the boy he couldn't set a bond because only Superior Court judges can do so in murder cases. 'I'm going to see that you get a lawyer immediately,' Barton told the boy. Grief: Antonio's father Luis Santiago tries to comfort Ms West at her apartment on Friday . Horror: Demarquis Elkins, 17, allegedly threatened Sherry West then shot her infant son when she didn't give him any money . The 14-year-old was in the eighth grade at Glynn Middle School before his arrest, said Jim Weidhaas, a school spokesman. Elkins was last a student in the . system in October 2011 when he left Ombudsman, an outsourced alternative . school program, Weidhaas said. The baby's mother said she was . walking home on Thursday morning when two boys confronted her and one of . them opened fire. Police say she was shot in the leg, and her baby was . shot in face. Gough said he has demanded a bond hearing and filed a request for a speedy trial for Elkins. 'We look forward to our day in court,' he said. Ms West recounted the attack this weekend. She said: 'He asked me for money and I said I didn't have it. 'When you have a baby, you spend all your money on babies. They're expensive. And he kept asking and I just said ""I don't have it."" And he said, ""Do you want me to kill your baby?"" And I said, ""No, don't kill my baby!""' Authorities said one of the teens fired four shots, grazing West's ear and striking her in the leg, before he walked around to the stroller and shot the baby in the face. West said her son was walking well on his own and eight of his teeth had come in. But she also mourned the milestones that will never come, like Antonio's first day at school. 'I'm always going to wonder what his first word would be,' West said. Tragedy: Little Antonio Santiago's stroller stands empty after the 13-month-old was shot in the head during a botched robbery . Tearful: West is devastated that she will never see her son grow up - or even learn to speak her name . Luis Santiago, the boy's father, said he must take comfort in his faith that his in a better place. 'He's all right,' Santiago told the boy's mother, trying to smile. 'He's potty training upstairs in heaven.' West said she took one look at a teenage suspect's jailhouse mugshot on Saturday and said he was definitely the killer. Yet an aunt of the teen said he was eating breakfast with her when the slaying took place. Despite the conflicting stories, police have charged 17-year-old De'Marquise Elkins with murder, along with a 14-year-old suspect whose name has been withheld because he's a juvenile. Brunswick police spokesman Todd Rhodes said even though Elkins' aunt provided an alibi, authorities have good reason to bring the charges. 'That's what she's saying, but the evidence we're looking at says something else,' Rhodes said, though he would not elaborate. Also Saturday, police in the coastal . port city released 911 recordings from neighbors who sobbed and pleaded . for help right after 13-month-old Antonio Santiago was shot in the head a . few blocks from his mother's apartment. Two teddy bears, a vase of flowers and a decorative cross had been left on Saturday against a wooden fence near the shooting scene. Katrina Freeman said Saturday the . shooter can't be her nephew, Elkins, because he showed up at her house . on Thursday at 8.15am - roughly an hour before the killing. She said she . cooked eggs, grits and sausage for breakfast and that Elkins . accompanied her and her children to run errands when they left at about . 11.30am. 'He was with us the whole time,' said . Freeman, adding that she gave police the same account of her nephew's . whereabouts. 'There is no doubt in my mind that he is innocent.' The slain boy's mother said she picked . the gunman out of a photo lineup of 24 mugshots police brought to her on . Friday. When a reporter showed her the photo of Elkins taken when he was . booked into the Glynn County jail Friday, she wept and nodded. Scene of the shooting: Antonio's upturned stroller still lies on its side in the residential area of Brunswick . ""He killed my baby, and he shot me, too,"" she said. At her apartment on Saturday, West had . filled several bags with her son's clothes and diapers to donate to . charity. She said she hopes prosecutors pursue the death penalty in the . case. 'My baby will never be back again,' West said, sobbing. 'He took an innocent life. I want his life, too.' In 2008, West's 18-year-old son was . stabbed to death in an altercation in New Jersey. Prosecutors said the . stabbing was self-defense and did not file charges. In Georgia, police said they are still searching for the gun. No eyewitnesses have come forward. In the 911 recordings, two callers . said they heard gunshots and then saw West take her son out of his . stroller, lay him on the ground and try to revive him using CPR. 'Yes, I heard the shots. Somebody shot . this child,' said one sobbing caller, who told the operator there were . three shots fired. 'She's got him on the ground. Please, we need . everything we can get.' The 911 operators asked the callers if . the boy was breathing. Finally, a man in a grave voice, answers: 'No, . the baby's not breathing.' He says the child was shot 'right between the . eyes'. A woman can be heard screaming in the background just before police arrive. Sirens drowned out her cries. Elkins' older sister, Sabrina Elkins, said . police arrested him as he came to her home on Friday. 'The police came pointing a Taser at . him, telling him to get on the ground,' she said. 'He said, ''What are . you getting me for? Can you tell me what I did?''' The suspect's sister said he returned . to Brunswick a couple of months ago after living in Atlanta for a while. While he wasn't enrolled in high school, she said, he had been taking . classes to earn his GED. 'He couldn't have done that to a little baby,' Sabrina Elkins said. 'My brother has a good heart.'

Germany has re-opened an investigation into the massacre of 642 French villagers by Nazi soldiers in one of the darkest chapters of World war Two. Almost the entire population of Oradour-sur-Glane, including 400 women and children, was gunned down or burned alive in a single day by SS troops on June 10, 1944. More than 68 years later, a German prosecutor and senior police officers have visited the abandoned village in central France, which Hitlers troops burned to the ground before they fled. German authorities believe there may still be six men still at large, . all now in their late 80s, who were members of SS Panzer Division that . committed the atrocity. Scroll down for video . Germany's investigators walk in front of the ruins of Oradour-sur-Glane, central France, yesterday. An investigation for crimes of war is led . by German and French authorities 68 years after the 1944 massacre . Other investigations into the . massacre have been started over the past 60 years, but all earlier . probes were abandoned due to lack of evidence . The team of investigators from Berlin (pictured) want to speak to the only two living survivors of the bloodbath, carried . out in revenge for the capture of a German officer by French resistance . fighters in a nearby village . The village has been left untouched since the massacre to serve both as a shrine to those who died and as a constant reminder of the unremitting evil of the Nazis. The team of investigators from Berlin want to speak to the only two living survivors of the bloodbath, carried out in revenge for the capture of a German officer by French resistance fighters in a nearby village. Although several probes have previously been opened into the massacre, they had to be shut down due to a lack of evidence. But when a historian in 2010 discovered documents implicating all six suspects, still alive and now aged between 85 and 86, the case had enough evidence to be re-opened. The documents were found in files kept by the Stasi, former East Germany's feared and hated secret police. The German authorities are under . constant pressure from Jewish and human rights pressure groups to round . up Nazi war criminals before they die. The latest probe into the Oradour massacre comes after detectives from . Berlin re-opened an investigation three years ago into another mass . murder of 124 people in the French village of Maille in August 1944, but . no culprits have yet been brought to justice. The women and children were herded into the village church where SS troopers had soaked the . church pews with petrol and barred all exits. Fire grenades were tossed . among the villagers and those that survived were later burned alive as a reprisal for attacks on German . soldiers occupying France by members of the French Resistance . movement. More than 200 men were herded into a barn where machine gunners opened fire, shooting at their legs so they could not move then dousing them with petrol and setting them alight. The village has purposely been left . untouched since the massacre, to serve both as a shrine to those who . died and as a constant reminder of the unremitting evil of the Nazis . Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel told French reporters in Oradour: 'We hope the survivors may be able to help us identify any culprits who are still alive' Remains of a burnt out vehicle.

Dortmund . prosecutor Andreas Brendel told French reporters in Oradour: 'We hope . the survivors may be able to help us identify any culprits who are still . alive.' Three trials of 30 . former SS officers have taken place since 1953, but only one man, . SS-Obersturmfhrer Heinz Barth, was ever convicted. In 1953 a French military tribunal sentenced 21 Nazi soldiers  to death . for the atrocities they committed. They were never executed and their . sentences commuted in the name of ‘national reconciliation’ between . France and Germany. The only man convicted was SS-Obersturmfhrer Heinz Barth, who gave the order to shoot 20 male victims. Barth was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1983 and released in 1997. He died  ten years later in August 2007. Oradour-sur-Glane in a picture taken not long after the troops left and survivors were left to pick up the pieces .

Early on the morning of 10 June 1944, the 2nd SS Panzer Division entered the village of Oradour-sur-Glane to avenge the death of a German officer who had been kidnapped by the French Resistance. They marched into the town and separated the men from the women and children. The men were taken to six barns and shed while the women and children were locked in the church while the village was looted. The men were said to be shot in the legs before being doused in petrol and set alight. Six men escaped although one was later found nearby and shot dead. In total 190 men perished. The soldiers proceeded to the church and tried to set it alight. Women and children tried to escape through the doors and windows of the church, but were met with machine-gun fire. A total of 247 women and 205 children died. Two women and one child survived; one was 47-year-old Marguerite Rouffanche. She hauled herself out of a window behind the altar, followed by a young woman and child. German soldiers shot all three of them, killing the woman and child by wounding Rouffanche who escaped into nearby foliage where she stayed until she was rescued the following day. The following is part of her testimony read out to the 1953 Bordeaux military tribunal: . 'Firing burst out in the church then straw, faggots and chairs were thrown pele-mele onto bodies lying on the stone slabs. I had escaped from the killing and was without injury so I made use of a smoke cloud to slip behind the altar. In this part of the church there are three windows. I made for the widest one in the middle and with the help of a stool used to light the candles, I tried to reach it. I don't know how but my strength was multiplied. I heaved myself up to it as best I could and threw myself out of the opening that was offered to me through the already shattered window. I jumped about nine feet down. 'When I looked up I saw I had been followed in my climb by a woman holding out her baby to me. She fell down next to me but the Germans, alerted by the cries of the baby, machine-gunned us. The woman and the mite were killed and I too was injured as I made it to a neighbouring garden and hid among some rows of peas and waited anxiously for someone to come to help me. That wasn't until the following day at 5 p.m.' Several other investigations into the . massacre have been started over the past 60 years, but all earlier . probes were abandoned due to lack of evidence. Mr Brendel added: 'This time we aim to make arrests and put those responsible on trial for war crimes.' Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel said that the aim of the visit, . the first by German investigators since World War Two was to identify . the exact locations where the SS unit was deployed and interview . witnesses to the massacre. French historian Guy Perlier told Le Figaro newspaper, ‘ This . illustrates German thinking which insists on shedding light on all acts . committed by the German army during this period’. Camille Senon, one of the survivors who witnessed the aftermath of . the massacre in which her family members died, said: ‘It is considered . a positive gesture by the Germans to send investigators for the first . time, 68 years after, even though I would have liked to have seen it . happen sooner’.

French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler doesn't the President's ex-partner from gaining a top cabinet post in his government . French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler is trying to block the President's ex-partner from gaining a top cabinet post in his government, it was revealed today. Ms Trierweiler, 47, has been 'putting pressure' on Francois Hollande not to let Segolene Royal - also the mother of his four children - into his closest circle of ministers, the French media reported. The bitter rivalry between the two women has been described as a 'Bermuda love triangle' by insiders at the presidential Elysee Palace. Their feud six years ago when Mr Hollande, 57, separated from Ms Royal after 28 years together and began a relationship with journalist Ms Trierweiler after meeting her at a political rally. The First Lady was then at the centre of accusations in May that she tried to wreck Ms Royal's political career by tweeting her support for a candidate standing against her in the parliamentary elections. Ms Royal - a former presidential candidate in 2005 - lost the election and later said she had been 'stabbed in the back' by Mr Hollande's girlfriend. Ms Trierweiler is said to be still so jealous of Ms Royal that she can not even bear to hear her name spoken. Now France's Ici Paris magazine has reported: 'Ms Royal has made it quite clear to the president that she wants a place in his government. 'But Ms Trierweiler is opposed to this and is putting pressure on the president to shut the door in her face. 'He has not yet revealed his intentions, possibly because he is well aware of the complicated relations between his girlfriend and his ex-partner, and does not want to upset Ms Trierweiler.' And news magazine VSD added: 'One insider at the Elysee Palace told us the three-way relationship is like a Bermude love triangle - you can't cross it without something going wrong. 'Another source said no one is looking forward to the two women coming face to face if Ms Royal gets a ministerial post and they meet in the Elysee Palace after a cabinet meeting.' Ms Trierweiler has been the target of repeated attacks by the French media and MPs since Mr Hollande won the election last May. 'Bitter rivalry': Ms Trierweiler has been 'putting pressure' on Francois Hollande (left) not to let Segolene Royal (right), who is the mother of his four children, into his closest circle of ministers, the French media reported . Outspoken French MP Bernard Debre recently branded her 'nothing more than the President's mistress' and told her to 'stop meddling' in the country's affairs. He wrote on his own internet blog: 'Madame Trierweiler, self-proclaimed first Lady, is nothing more than the President's mistress. 'What is she meddling in? What right does she have to speak out? 'When one is in her position, after the blunders she has already made, it would be much better it she shut up.' Ms Trierweiler also faced humiliation in September when her boss at the French magazine where she works said she would be sacked at the end of this year. Ms Trierweiler is said to be still so jealous of Ms Royal that she can not even bear to hear her name spoken . Glossy weekly Paris Match's owner Arnaud Lagardere branded her her as 'an unpinned grenade' who has caused him 'nothing but trouble' and said he would not be renewing her contract in January. The First Lady is also demanding 70,000 pounds in damages over a book claiming that six years ago she cheated on her now divorced husband with two lovers at once. Ms Trierweiler was the shared mistress of left-wing President Francois Hollande and right-wing minister Patrick Devedjian while she was married, the biography called The Troublemaker claimed. And a separate book about Ms Trierweiler called Between Two Fires, by investigative journalist Anna Cabana describes her 'a cocktail of jealousy, vengeance and political calculation'. And a third book about her called The Favorite by journalist . Laurent Greilsamer also writes: 'As I see it, you have shown yourself to be not normal, snooty, infatuated, explosive, unpredictable. And visibly dangerous.'","Ms Trierweiler 'putting pressure' on Francois Hollande not to let Segolene Royal into his close circle .

The result is 200 black and white . photographs celebrating the glory of nature while examining the . fragility of the natural world. Genesis explorations lead him to think there are lessons Westerners can learn from other societies, such as the Amazonian Zoé tribe. ‘The populations I was photographing were so mobile – but we sit all day, we become heavy, we eat bad food with lots of chemicals inside,’ he told Metro. ‘We can slowly change the model of our way of life.’ During the 8 years in which Salgado travelled around the world to produce this collection of images, he often stayed with the people he photographed. The exhibition's design follows the 5 themes in Genesis: Sanctuaries, Planet South, Africa, Northern Spaces, and Amazonia and Pantanal. 'Many of us live in cities, cut off completely from the planet. My wish was to experience living with people with real links to nature... For me to go back to nature was a huge pleasure. I wished to present the planet in my language, photography. And so came Genesis,' he said.

A French family of seven - including four children - has been kidnapped by Al Qaeda in Cameroon today. The family is believed to have been taken from northern Cameroon to Nigeria, where another group of foreign nationals were taken yesterday. The seven foreigners, including one Briton, were abducted by a little-known extremist group on Monday, a French official said. Radical abductions: Members of Nigerian radical Islamist group Ansaru, pictured in November, which has previously claimed responsibility for kidnapping foreign nationals in the area . The abductions follow a French military mission in Mali to remove Islamic jihadists who had taken control of the north of the country. Details of the kidnapping were not immediately clear, however, President Francois Hollande, speaking during a visit to Greece, noted that terrorists 'are not just in Mali.' Hollande warned French citizens in the region to avoid putting themselves in dangerous situations. A total of 15 French citizens are currently being held in western Africa - one other in Nigeria and seven thought to be in northern Mali. Boko Haram - which means 'Western education is sacrilege' - has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings and shootings across Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north. Stern words: Francois Hollande warned that there is a threat against French nationals following the French military mission in Mali . It is blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to an AP count. It is known to have ties to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, an Algerian-based group that opened a front in Mali. 'If everything is confirmed, this signifies that the fight against terrorist groups is a necessity,' Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in Paris. 'There is a battle to be led by the international community against terrorist groups and narco-terrorists,' a reference to the trafficking in drugs, cigarettes and other commodities that has flourished in northern Mali under the extremists. The latest kidnappings have added to fears of instability and danger toward Westerners. Before Tuesday, there were eight French citizens being held in the region, including one who was taken in Nigeria. An analysis published Monday by Stratfor, a U.S.-based private global intelligence firm, warned that there likely will be more attacks by Ansaru targeting Westerners and Western interests in Nigeria, as well as neighboring nations.","Three adults and four children kidnapped in Cameroon .

Investigators . have said the gun Ebel used in the shootout he was killed in was the . same gun used to kill Clements when the prisons chief answered the front . door of his home. Both Lohr and Guolee were already wanted on warrants unrelated to Clements' death. Guolee, who remains at large, is a parolee who served time for intimidating a witness and giving a pawnbroker false information, among other charges, court records show. Lohr was being sought on warrants out of Las Animas County for a bail violation and a violation of a protection order, according to court records. The 211 gang is one of the most vicious white supremacist groups operating in U.S. prisons, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups. It was founded in 1995 to protect white prisoners from attacks and operates only in Colorado, according to the center. Ebel joined the 211 Crew after he entered prison in 2005 for a string of assault and menacing charges that combined for an eight-year sentence. He was supposed to spend an extra four years in prison for punching a prison officer in the face in 2006, but a clerical error led that sentence to be recorded as one to be served simultaneously with his previous sentences. Authorities believe Lohr was in contact with gang associate Evan Ebel days before the murders of Clements and pizza delivery man Nate Leon . Chaos: Ebel was killed by police following a shootout and a high-speed chase that resulted in a fiery crash in Texas . Lisa Clements, Tom Clements' widow, is supported by her daughters Sara (L) and Rachel as she speaks at his memorial . He was released on parole January 28. Records show that the vendor operating the electronic monitoring bracelet that Ebel wore noted a 'tamper alert' March 14. Corrections officials left a message for Ebel telling him to report in two days and have the bracelet repaired, records show. The next day, for the first time since his release, Ebel did not call in for his daily phone check-in. On March 16, he missed his appointment to repair the bracelet. Only on the following day do the records show that a note was made in the corrections system that he failed to show up. By then, Leon, a father of three, was shot and killed after answering a call for a pizza at a Denver truck stop. Lisa leaves his memorial services with minister Matt Heard (R) and L.M. Jaros at New Life Church . Family man: Clements, the married father of two daughters, was mourned by law enforcement officials across the state . On March 18, parole officers contacted Ebel's father, who said he was concerned his son had fled and gave them permission to search Evan Ebel's apartment. The next afternoon, two parole officers concluded he had fled. Hours later, Clements answered his doorbell and was fatally shot. The next morning, still unaware of a connection with the most recent slaying, the state issued a warrant for Ebel's arrest on parole violations. A sheriff's deputy in rural Texas pulled Ebel over March 21, but he fled. Ebel was killed in the shootout that followed. Clements, born in St. Louis, worked for 31 years in the Missouri Department of Corrections, both in prison and as a parole officer, before he joined the Colorado Department of Corrections in 2011.","White supremacist gang member James Lohr was taken into custody early Friday .

Fleeing France: Musician Jean-Michel Jarre may move his business to London's new 'Tech City' to escape France's looming tax hikes . French millionaire composer Jean-Michel Jarre is set to flee to London to escape France's looming socialist tax hikes on the rich. The icon of electronic pop music may join a flood of well-heeled French moving to 'wealth-friendly' countries like Britain, Switzerland and Belgium. The 64-year-old musician has met Downing Street officials to discuss relocating his business to London's new 'Tech City', a media and technology hub in east London. His move will come after film star Gerard Depardieu and France's richest man Bernard Arnault both announced earlier this year that they were moving to Belgium - where taxes are significantly lower than France. French optician shop tycoon Alain Afflelou, another of France's richest men, has also announced he is moving to Britain to expand his business empire. A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron's office told France's AFP news agency: 'Jean-Michel Jarre visited Downing Street to meet with officials about Tech City, London's media and technology hub. 'There are a growing number of businesses and entrepreneurs from across the world who want to be part of the technology cluster in east London and we are keen for that to continue.' Jarre is known for his spectacular concerts and hit seventies albums Oxygene and Equinoxe. He also owns Jarre Technologies, a company which makes products like the AeroPad One, a dock speaker for iPods, iPads and iPhones. Mr Cameron angered the French in June when he said Britain would 'roll out the red carpet' to welcome more French businesses to the UK. Negotiations: French musician Jean-Michel Jarre, pictured on stage in Monaco, has held talks with Downing Street officials in recent months about the possibility of relocating his business to Britain . Mass exodus: Actor Gerard Depardieu, pictured above left in January 1990, and France's richest man Bernard Arnault, pictured right, have both announced plans to move to Belgium because of France's impending tax hike . He told a business summit in Mexico: 'And they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and everything else.' The exodus from France began after left-wing President Francois Hollande announced plans for new higher tax of 75 per cent on all earnings over one million euros (£850,000). France's highest court last week ruled the tax was illegal because it targeted individual earnings and not the joint in come of a household.

But Mr Hollande has insisted he plans . to fight the court ruling and raise taxes on the rich to ensure 'those . with the most pay the most'.

Crossing the Channel: Another of France's richest men, Alain Afflelou, has also announced he is moving his business to Britain . Luxury property agent Daniel Feau said: . 'It's nearly a general panic out there with some 400 to 500 residences . worth more than one million euros coming onto the Paris market since . May. 'And the profile of those who are leaving has changed, from the idle rich to managers of major international corporations who are scared of a marginal tax rate of 62.21 percent on sales of stock.'

British estate agent Sotherby's said this summer that its French offices sold more than 100 properties over 1.7 million euros between April and June this year - a marked increase on the same period in 2011.

Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn 'was fully aware' that young girls at orgies were being paid to have sex with him, a prostitute has told a court in France. The disgraced economist came face-to-face with the 30-year-old Belgian call girl during a pre-trial hearing into accusations he was part of a global vice network. Strauss-Kahn, 64, insists he only ever had sex with 'willing young women' at sleazy swingers parties around the world. In court: Former International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn insists he did not know he was having sex with prostitutes . But the hooker named Jade told a judge in the French town of Douai on Thursday that the man once tipped as a future president of France KNEW the girls were prostitutes. Strauss-Kahn is appealing a decision to send him to trial on charges of 'aggravated pimping as part of an organised gang', when he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. His latest court appearance was aimed at discovering if he genuinely believed that young women in their 20s were having sex with him for free. According to a judicial source quoted in French newspapers today, Jade told the court: 'He was fully aware we were prostitutes being paid to have sex.' The same prostitute revealed last year how she was flown to Washington DC, where she had sex with Strauss-Kahn at the city's four-star W Hotel. Then the next day, the International Monetary Fund boss even took her to his office at the institution where he managed the stability of the world's finances. Separated: Dominique Strauss-Kahn with his wife Anne Sinclair, . pictured outside Manhattan criminal court in 2011, at the time of the . alleged offences . But Jade also praised Strauss-Kahn for his 'courtesy and respect' during the sleazy swingers' parties. In an interview with France's Nord-Eclair newspaper in March 2012, she told how hookers at an orgy in Paris waited for Strauss-Kahn 'like the arrival of the Messiah'. She added: 'When he turned up, everyone was very admiring of him. He always had a certain charisma about him, an aura. 'I must say, I found DSK to be very pleasant and overly polite. 'Each encounter with him was mutually respectful. I have always ensured I am seen as a woman and not an object.' Strauss-Kahn is one of four Frenchmen charged with conspiring with pimps to procure girls for orgies in Paris, Lille, New York and Washington DC. He is also accused of knowing fraudulently obtained money was being used to fund the vice network based in the northern French city of Lille. The looming trial in France is the last in a catalogue of sex scandals that began when Strauss-Kahn was arrested for trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May 2011. After being held in New York's notorious Ryker's Island prison, criminal charges were dropped and he recently paid hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo four million pounds in a civil settlement. He returned to France last year only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer. When those allegations were also dropped, he was then confronted with the latest claims he used knowingly used hookers supplied by the Lille vice network. His lawyer Richard Malka has described Strauss-Kahn as 'simple swinger' whose only crime was giving in to his 'lustful urges'. Mr Malka said his client intended to appeal every decision to send him to trial, branding the charges 'as false as they are absurd'. Strauss-Kahn remains under 'judicial control' on £85,000 bail until a new date is set for his appeal hearing in the French Cour de Cassation. The hugely experienced economist has meanwhile made a discreet return to public life, giving a speech on the global finances in China and advising the Greek government on their massive debts.","Disgraced economist insists he only ever had sex with 'willing young women'

After months of wrangling the stadium that hosted the most magical moments of the London Olympics has finally got a new tenant. West Ham have been handed the keys to the Olympic Stadium today after a deal for the tenancy was agreed. The club were named as the preferred bidders in December but negotiations with the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) have been long and tortuous. Scroll down for video . New home: A mock-up picture shows how the Olympic Stadium will be transformed after it was announced that Premier League club West Ham FC have become tenants under a 99-year lease . New tenants: The LLDC announced this morning that a deal has been signed off that sees the Barclays Premier League club become anchor tenants under a 99-year lease . But the LLDC announced this morning that a deal has now been signed off that sees the Barclays Premier League club become anchor tenants under a 99-year lease. The reported £150million facelift is due to be completed in time for the 2016-17 season. The Olympic Stadium will be transformed into a 54,000-seater venue, with the Hammers now set to embark on a detailed, independent supporter consultation process. The club's chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said in a joint statement: 'It's fantastic for everyone at West Ham United that at last all the club's hard work over the past three years has paid off.' 'Since we came to West Ham in 2010 we have had a vision to really take the club forward so West Ham United can compete on the pitch at the highest level.

Stunning: The stadium was the focal point of the 2012 London Games . 'It is an honour we will take on with pride.' The lease will give the club long-term security but they will have no property interest in the stadium.

Nelson Mandela will battle to recover from his life-threatening lung infection, a close friend believes. The comments from his lawyer, George Bizos, came as Mr Mandela spent his second night in hospital. He believes the 94-year-old is determined ‘to keep on going’ despite suffering a long history of illness. Scroll down for video . Ailing health: Nelson Mandela has been re-admitted to hospital with a recurrence of a lung infection, the South African government announced today . 'Having best possible treatment: Mr Mandela (pictured with his family celebrating his 93rd birthday) was taken into hospital shortly before midnight, according to South African President Jacob Zuma . Mr Zuma said Mr Mandela was doing 'very well' and said he was hoping to visit him in hospital as soon as possible . The anti-apartheid hero was admitted to . hospital late Wednesday night, prompting South African president Jacob . Zuma to call on the nation to prepare itself for the worst. But Mr Bizos said: 'It's a matter one doesn't have to discuss. I am 84 – every one of us wants to keep on going. 'I think that he has always had . confidence in members of the (health) profession and he has the love and . care of (his wife) Graca and members of his family and a few of his . friends that go to him from time to time. I think he enjoys that and . would like to continue.' The South African government today said Mr Mandela was in good spirits and making 'steady progress'. Mr Bizos, who defended Mr Mandela . during his 1960s treason trial told The Daily Telegraph he was planning . to visit his friend – either in hospital or at his home if he is . discharged – 'in the next day or so'. Mr Zuma said South Africans should be realistic about the prognosis because of Mr Mandela’s age. ‘In Zulu, when someone passes away . who is very old, people say he or she has gone home. I think those are . some of the things we should be thinking about,’ Mr Zuma said. It is the fourth time in just over two years that the increasingly frail Mr Mandela has been admitted to hospital. Mr Zuma said Mr Mandela was doing ‘very well’ and said he was hoping to visit him in hospital as soon as possible. But a family member said: 'He is very poorly. This (situation) is very worrying.' Zuma had yesterday called for the 'world to pray for our beloved Madiba', making reference to his clan name. Fondly referring to the Nobel Peace . Prize laureate by his clan name, he said: ‘We appeal to the people of . South Africa and the world to pray for our beloved Madiba and his family . and to keep them in their thoughts. ‘We have full confidence in the medical team and know that they will do everything possible to ensure recovery.’ The governing African National Congress called for prayers for Mr Mandela, as did US President Barack Obama. Reclusive: Mr Mandela last made a public appearance on a major stage when South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup. He is pictured here with his wife Graca Machel during the closing ceremony in Johannesburg . Mr Zuma’s office said Mr Mandela was . conscious and ‘responding positively’ to treatment but did not reveal . where he is being treated. Spokesman Mac Maharaj later added: ‘I think . we need to be clear that the doctors are attending to Madiba on a . continuous basis. They prefer to act on the side of caution, and the . moment they felt there was a recurrence of the lung infection, they felt . that it warranted immediate hospitalisation given his age and given his . history.’ Mr Mandela, who became South Africa’s . first black president in 1994, has been in and out of hospital for the . past few months. He spent 18 days on a ward in December undergoing . treatment for the lung infection and gallstones surgery. It was his longest stay in hospital . since 1990, when he was released from  prison after serving 27 years for . conspiring to overthrow the white-minority apartheid government. Icon: Mr Mandela strikes his famous salute with then-wife Winnie after being released from prison in 1990. He contracted tuberculosis in jail which has caused him a number of health problems over the years . But he has been frail and in poor . health for several years. It is believed his lung infection stems from a . bout of tuberculosis he contracted in the 1980s while working in a . prison quarry at the Robben Island jail. Mr Mandela spent much of last year in Qunu, his ancestral village in the poor Eastern Cape province. But since his release from hospital . in December he has been at his home in an affluent Johannesburg suburb, . close to sophisticated medical care. Earlier this month he underwent medical tests. Fondly called the ‘father of the nation’, Mr Mandela has been mostly absent from the political scene for the past decade. But he remains an enduring symbol of the struggle against racism.","George Bizos says Mr Mandela 'wants to keep going' despite long illness .

The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday urged David Cameron to raise the amount of taxpayers' money spent in development aid to poor countries. The Most Reverent Justin Welby called on the Prime Minister and other national leaders to stick to their pledge to increase aid because 'development is working'. Dr Welby said numbers living in extreme poverty in the world had halved since 1990 and said more could be done, 'but only if governments do not waver from the moral and political commitments that they made more than a decade ago.' The Most Rev and Rt Hon Justin Welby, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury has asked Cameron to invest more in foreign aid . Mr Cameron has promised to raise British . aid spending to 0.7 per cent of national income in line with . 'Millennium Goal' targets set by the United Nations. At present spending . is around 0.56 per cent, about £9 billion a year. The Coalition promises to hit the target figure next year, a pledge which will take British aid spending over the £10 billion mark. The Prime Minister is under pressure from backbench critics to cut aid on the grounds that most of it is wasted, abused or sucked up by corrupt regimes, and developing countries are better helped by growing trade. The Archbishop, who made his call in a letter to the Financial Times together with a group of other religious leaders, said financial crisis was not an excuse for cutting aid and governments should 'fulfil existing commitments to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid.' Dr Welby's letter was also backed by the leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols, other Christian and Islamic figureheads, together with Hindu, Jewish and Sikh leaders, and spokesmen from more minor faiths. Mr Cameron has promised to raise British aid spending to 0.7 per cent of national income in line with 'Millennium Goal' targets set by the United Nations .

But challenges remain,' the leaders said. 'The number of people living in extreme poverty has been halved ahead of time and 14,000 fewer children die each day than in 1990. 'Yet one in eight people still goes to bed hungry every night and more than two million die of malnutrition every year.' Dr Welby and his fellow leaders added: 'The financial crisis may be a reason but is not an excuse for deferral. MP Douglas Carswell dopes not believe that improvements in developing countries are down to foreign aid from the west . 'In addition to providing for the wellbeing of our own societies, we have a collective responsibility to uphold human dignity and the common good at the global level.' The letter said G8 countries should co-operate to stop untaxed wealth being hidden and to encourage more open finances in developing countries. However the claim that development aid has been responsible for reducing poverty over the past two decades met a scathing response from economists and Tory MPs, who said economic growth in China, the Far East, India, Africa and Latin America has been the overwhelming reason why people are better off. Tory MP for Clacton Douglas Carswell said: 'I grew up in one of the poorest countries on the planet, where my parents worked as doctors in a mission hospital. I can tell you the improvement in living standards in Uganda and Africa has not been brought about by aid. 'Development aid is a government-to-government subsidy that has only encouraged corruption. Uganda and Africa have improved because Africans are joining the global marketplace, because of the impact of individual donors like Bill Gates, and because of new technology.' Economist Ruth Lea of the Arbuthnot Banking Group said: 'Aid is of residual importance, to be kind to it. What has brought people out of poverty is economic growth. 'It has not been aid that has taken people out of poverty in China and India, and what governments really need to do get rid of poverty is to adopt pro-growth policies.'","The Most Reverent Justin Welby said 'development is working'

Ipswich has seen a sharp drop in the number of people boozing and brawling in the street after they clamped down on off-licences selling super strength alcohol. Ipswich's drastic move has sparked a plunge in crime and anti-social behaviour of nearly 50 per cent related to street drinking since the mission was launched six months ago. Police have said that reported incidents involving street boozers were slashed to 94 between September and March this year, compared to 191 during the same period the year before. After Ipswich banned off-licences selling ultra-strong alcohol, police have reported an almost 50 per cent drop in street crime . By the end of last year, there was a 20 per cent cut in the number of people defined as being part of the street-drinking community. East of England Co-op has also stripped super strength alcohol off the shelves in all 53 of its Suffolk stores. The campaign has been so successful that the huge high-street chain is now in high-level discussions about banishing it from all 135 of its off-licensed premises across East Anglia. Some 80 out of 122 off-licences in Ipswich have now voluntarily stopped selling cheap, highly-potent lagers and ciders. Ipswich generated massive national media coverage when it kickstarted the bold drive last September. Now the rest of the UK looks set to follow the example of the Suffolk town, which has clamped down on those selling strong booze . Apart from Co-ops and independent retailers, Tesco, Martin McColl, Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, BHS, Waitrose, Sainsbury's and Aldi are all backing the groundbreaking scheme. Among the other partners leading the campaign are Ipswich Borough Council, Suffolk County Council, and NHS Suffolk. 'Start Afresh', the over-arching operation launched in 2011 to tackle issues surrounding street drinking in Ipswich, has seen a number of improvements being made. It is not the first time Ipswich has been seen as a template for helping the vulnerable in society. Following the murders of prostitutes by Suffolk Strangler Steve Wright in 2006, the town~s innovative street prostitution strategy was lauded by many and implemented elsewhere. Ipswich residents say they are thrilled to see the amount of street drinkers fall and have welcomed the booze ban . Reducing the Strength has been hailed for helping to make lives of the people who live and trade in the town more tolerable. Mike Brain, a neighbourhood watch co-ordinator in Ipswich, said: 'I think it's brilliant. 'The residents have noticed a difference. 'In 2008/09 there were real problems in our area. 'Those have gone. We have very, very few instances now. 'It seems to me that over the years we have learned more and more about the harm alcohol can do. 'With street drinkers you hear all sorts of stories. You can imagine people's lives falling apart. 'Reducing the Strength is a really good step forward.' The Suffolk town's trailblazing Reducing the Strength campaign has sparked a plunge in crime and anti-social behaviour . Strong alcohol, such as Tennent's lager, has been banned from being sold . Roger Grosvenor, of East of England Co-operative Society, said the company would continue to help spearhead the brave blueprint. All 53 of its Suffolk stores, including the 26 in Ipswich, have voluntarily stopped selling super-strength alcohol. Mr Grosvenor said they were now poised impose the ban across the region. 'There has been no significant impact on turnover and even if there had been we would have still continued to support this initiative,' he said. Suffolk's assistant chief constable, Tim Newcomb, said:'The support we have received from independent and national retailers has been fantastic. 'A significant number of police forces and public sector agencies across the UK have been in contact with us to talk about our campaign. 'We look forward to assisting others in setting up similar initiatives and looking at the potential for rolling it out across the county.' And now the Suffolk town's pioneering Reducing the Strength campaign - launched to crack down on street crime - is now taking off all over the country. Towns and cities across the UK will follow its example by stopping shopkeepers selling ultra-strong alcohol, which has been linked to street disorder. Insp Andrew Mason, of Ipswich Police, said: 'We have had about 50 enquiries from police forces and councils about the Reducing the Strength campaign. 'We have put together an email pack to send to those who have contacted us.' He added: 'Portsmouth and Lincoln have decided to appoint street drinking liaison officers like we have in PC John Alcock. 'I made a presentation in London to 140 officers and we have boroughs down there such as Hackney and Camden coming to see us to see what we are doing.'","Ipswich led campaign to clampdown on street disorder .

A teenager who was given a reward for chasing down a robber in the street has been jailed just weeks later for committing robbery himself. Thomas Dolan was praised by a judge at Gloucester Crown Court last month for his selfless act of bravery, and awarded £250 from public funds. But yesterday he appeared in the same court to be sentenced to two years' detention for attacking a delivery driver in a drunken rage and stealing from him. The 19-year-old was forced to give his £250 reward to the victim as compensation for the brutal robbery. On March 2, Dolan was congratulated in court for chasing after and catching a man who had stolen £10 from a woman after she withdrew it from a cash machine in Gloucester city centre. Judge William Hart said that the teenager had put himself in harm's way for the good of a stranger, and gave him a reward from the Sheriff of Gloucestershire's fund. But it has now emerged that Dolan had previously been arrested on suspicion of robbing fast food deliveryman Abdul Seer in a residential street in Gloucester. When he pleaded guilty to the crime yesterday, judge Jamie Tabor said: 'It would be hard to find a more citizenly and public-spirited action than the one you took a few months ago. 'But then you ambushed a food delivery man outside your house and subjected him to an extremely unpleasant sustained assault with your fists and your feet. 'Your actions that night were inexplicable - an enigma, a complete puzzle.' Attack: Dolan robbed a driver as he was delivering fast food to this road in Gloucester . Susan Cavender, prosecuting, said a call had been made to order food from a takeaway late at night which was later found to have come from Dolan's phone. When Mr Seer went into the front yard of the house where the delivery was ordered he was attacked by Dolan, who punched him in the face and shouted at him to give him the food. 'Mr Seer was then punched a number of times, and the defendant also kicked him when he was down on the ground,' she said. 'He shouted to Mr Seer to stay on the ground and took the food and made off. But Mr Seer saw him go into a nearby house and when police arrived on the scene he directed them to it. 'The defendant ran off through gardens, but he was arrested nearby.' Mr Seer was taken to hospital and suffered continual headaches and other complications for two weeks afterwards, said the prosecutor. He was also scared of being targeted again, and worried he would lose earnings while he was unable to work. Jailed: The teenager was sentenced to two years in detention after pleading guilty to robbery at Gloucester Crown Court, pictured . Dolan told police he had drunk eight or nine cans of strong lager before carrying out the attack. Defending, Sarah Jenkins said the teenager's actions had been a moment of madness which was completely out of character. 'He is not a violent young man and there is no suggestion that this kind of violence has ever been exhibited by him before,' she said. 'He was significantly under the influence of alcohol. He does not normally drink much but is a classic binge drinker. 'He knows that now and since this incident he has not touched alcohol at all and intends never to drink again.' Mr Tabor sentenced Dolan to two years in detention and ordered him to pay a £100 victim surcharge as well as the £250 compensation.","Thomas Dolan, 19, given £250 reward last month for chasing down robber .

A professional wrestler who took part in a £1.5 million pound VAT scam with a former lance corporal has been jailed. Ghent Wakefield, 32, was offered a contract with America's famous WWE wrestling federation in 2011 - but his dreams of stardom were dashed after he ruptured both biceps. After suffering the career-ending injury at a show in Skegness, the former male stripper turned to a life of crime. Professional wrestler Ghent Wakefield became part of a £1.5milion VAT scam - and lived the life of luxury . He set up a company in his name to allow Paul Hackney, 36, a former lance corporal in the Royal Artillery, to use for a lucrative fraud. Hackney, from Salford, Manchester, used a string of companies to claim refunds for sales of construction equipment which had never taken place. Wakefield’s company - Equinox Manufacturing - was used in a failed bid to make a fraudulent VAT reclaim for £45,000. A court heard Wakefield also acted as 'henchman' for Hackney and chauffeured him around in a Rolls Royce Phantom. Professional wrestler Ghent Wakefield suffered a career-ending injury during a show in Skegness and became implicated in a scam . In return, Hackney treated Wakefield to an all expenses first-class trip to Australia and helicopter tours in London, where they stayed in luxury hotels. In October last year Hackney was jailed for six years for fraudulently exploiting EU trade rules to fund his extravagant lifestyle. He admitted conspiracy to cheat HM Revenue and Customs and conspiring to launder money. And on Tuesday Wakefield, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, joined him behind bars after being sentenced to 17 months in prison at Manchester Crown Court. He was found guilty of conspiracy to cheat the revenue at an earlier trial. Wakefield took up wrestling in 2009 and joined the British Wrestling Alliance. Wakefield had harboured hopes of joining the WWE - but instead ended up being a henchman for a former lance corporal . After his dreams of stardom were dashed, Wakefield set up a company in his name to allow Paul Hackney, 36, a former lance corporal in the Royal Artillery, to use for a lucrative fraud . The wrestler later impressed WWE scouts and he was offered a training contract in 2011 subject to a physical test. But he suffered an unfortunate injury at a show in Skegness, Lincolnshire, that same year and ruptured both biceps, which ended his dreams of stardom. Prior to that Wakefield had appeared at a tournament in his home town which had featured the world famous masked wrestler Kendo Nagasaki. Sentencing Judge Martin Steiger QC, said: 'Wakefield was Hackney’s driver and henchman when Hackney was ironically studying for a law degree. The pair were sentenced at Manchester Crown Court after their VAT scam was rumbled . 'Furthermore, this defendant received treats quite apart from what he was paid by Hackney - he went on a lavish trip to Australia and two ostentatious trips by helicopter. 'He must have known all this profusion of money squandered on luxuries was coming from crime.' Nicholas Tatlow, defending, said Wakefield had derived limited benefit from the fraud. He told the court: 'It's plain that this defendant was used and manipulated by a particularly sophisticated and intelligent criminal, Paul Hackney. 'He’s a man who was plainly anxious to please and a man who was all too easily impressed by Hackney's show of wealth and sophistication.'","Ghent Wakefield suffered career-ending injury during a show in Skegness .

A police officer is suing a burglary victim for £10,000 after allegedly falling into a drain while investigating a break-in. PC Richard Seymour says he tore an Achilles tendon and spent four months in a cast after the fall during a 4am call-out to the man's shop in March last year. The 34-year-old officer is now suing owner Stuart Lambley for 'loss of overtime' during his six-month absence from work – despite being on full pay throughout this time. A letter from PC Seymour's lawyers . adds that the officer also missed out on special duties during the . London 2012 Olympics – something which came as a 'bitter disappointment' to him. Mr Lambley said: 'I was in complete shock when I received the letter last month. 'I won't be calling the police any . more. I don't see the point. Not if there's a danger of getting sued. It . should not be allowed.' The claim emerges just days after WPC . Kelly Jones sparked public outrage and was criticised by her own chief . constable for suing a burglary victim for £50,000.

He added: 'He has signed up to be a police officer, he knows there is some risk involved. 'It's ridiculous and disgusting that a copper should think it is okay to sue someone who has called him for help.'

She added the 'vast majority' of her officers . would 'never consider making a private compensation claim against a . victim of crime'. Mr Lambley, who has been in the . aquatics business for more than 20 years, said the burglary, in which . his safe was broken into and property damaged, has already cost him more . than £2,000 in losses and repairs. 'We had a number of break-ins around . that period and each time the police didn't catch anyone,' he added. 'On . this occasion, again no one was caught and instead I've been landed . with this. He said he does not even know where PC Seymour fell and said . officers had arrived at the property before him after responding to an . automatic alarm. He said: 'I saw him attempt to climb . over the fence to get in. I saw that PC Seymour was hobbling a bit. But . he didn't mention falling into a drain or a manhole. 'If he wants to try to climb over a fence then that's his business. The whole claim is ridiculous.' PC Seymour's lawyers, London-based . Slater & Gordon, claim Mr Lambley's business exposed him to a . 'foreseeable risk'. Their letter states: 'Our client fell into an open . downpipe drain which was not covered at the time. It was extremely dark . and our client didn't see the opening.' It was not possible to reach PC .

Campaigners have hit out at this growing compensation culture, warning the spiralling council payouts mean less money is spent on education. Compensation culture: Schools are paying out hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to those hurt in classroom accidents . Payouts: Families in Lancashire have been awarded almost £800,000 over the past five years after they sued over falls, slips, fingers trapped in doors and other mishaps . The figures come a month after it emerged that compensation for teachers injured at work broke through the £30million barrier for the first time in 2012. A request under the Freedom of Information Act revealed there were 100 successful claims for injuries sustained by pupils on Lancashire school property between 2006-7 and 2011-12. The resulting payouts added up to £783,831. One pupil won almost £50,000 after hurting his hand climbing a gate, while another received more than £6,000 for cutting a leg sliding down a handrail. A third was awarded £12,519 after they fell while climbing a tree. In another case a pupil was awarded £2,500 after pricking their thumb on a needle. There were multiple payouts for hands trapped in doors, with the highest payout in this category amounting to £7,695. Minor injuries: A third was awarded £12,519 after they fell while climbing a tree. In another case a pupil was awarded £2,500 after pricking their thumb on a needle . The largest single award was £100,000, given to a pupil who was injured when a cupboard fell off a wall. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Some of the claims will have been perfectly legitimate because of negligence, but a good number will either have been nobody’s fault or could have been avoided with a bit of common sense: at the end of the day, accidents do happen. 'Every penny spent on settling these claims means less money spent on educating children.’ And Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, warned that schools were becoming so ‘risk-conscious’ that they wrapped children up ‘in cotton wool.’ Bob Stott, of Lancashire county council, said: ‘When the council receives a claim for compensation it has to make a decision regarding its liability, and defend or settle the case as appropriate.

HMV called in administrators from Deloitte in January but hopes of a rescue deal were subsequently raised after Hilco bought the company's £176million of debt for a reported £40million. It was announced in February that 66 of HMV's 220 shops would close over two months, at the cost of nearly 1,000 jobs. Declining sales: HMV went into administration in January as it battled against declining sales of CDs and DVDs as well as competition from supermarkets and online retailers .

A male boss would have had me fired. Not only was I running a week late on a very important deadline, but I’d lied about how well the project was going. I’d made a stupid and very embarrassing mistake and was desperately trying to cover it up. In the end my only option was to come clean and go grovelling to the top for forgiveness. Luckily for my career’s sake, what followed was not the verbal battering, formal warning and possible P45 I’d have got from a man — it was a gentle dressing-down and sympathetic enquiry as to whether I was all right. She also said these things happen. In short, I got away with it. But was it because my boss, as a woman, was naturally more empathic and fair-minded? Or was it because she looked at me doing my best puppy-dog eyes and couldn’t resist my charms? According to a study published last week, women make better bosses than men thanks to their ‘cooperation, collaboration and consensus-building in order to make decisions’. I couldn’t agree more. As a magazine journalist, I’ve worked for strong, powerful women for most of my career, and they’ve made far better bosses than the men. The more women at the top, the better, I say. But not because of their co-operation, collaboration, etc. It’s because I can flirt with them and get away with far more than I ever could under a man. Have the firms I’ve worked for benefited from the female touch? Who cares? I’m not a board member, I’m just paid to do my job. And that job has often been made far easier thanks to the fact I’m working for women who cannot help but be seduced by my cheeky-chappy charms. It should be said that I’m not the best-looking man in the world. But I’ve been known to turn on the charm. And no matter how powerful or brilliant my woman bosses have been (and most have been brilliant), being a man has almost always helped me get on with them. There was the boss who saw herself as a mother figure to me, treating any professional failings on my part as something we could overcome together, and cutting me far more slack than any of my women colleagues. There was another who regularly asked me for advice on her love life then gave me the better jobs to do as a thank-you. I’ve been extravagantly flirted with by another two bosses — one who, like me, is married, and said she enjoyed it because she knew neither of us would really want anything to come of it. About ten years ago, another female boss had a crush on me. Even though I’d no intention of taking her for a drink, I kept up the pretence that I might. Cheeky chappy charm: Dominic said he can get away with more with a female boss (posed by models) According to the study, male bosses tend to follow ‘rules, regulations and traditional ways of doing business’. For me, that’s meant male editors have refused to take any nonsense, been unforgiving of failure — and happy to punish slackness, sloppiness or even honest mistakes with a good old-fashioned bawling out. That way everyone knows who’s Alpha Dog. It’s not pleasant to be on the receiving end but there’s no disputing it works. The women editors have, as the study says, ruled through cooperation. They’ve opted to motivate staff through example and inspiration rather than fear and intimidation. The end product hasn’t necessarily been better — but it’s made my life a whole lot easier. Although they have, for the most part, been excellent at their jobs, they’ve not been immune to the charms of a straight man in offices mostly filled with women. Noticing that your boss has had her hair done sounds too obvious a way to wriggle out of an uncomfortable situation. But shallow tactics have helped me often. I’ve also got away with more office hangovers than I should — they’re seen as somehow more acceptable for a man — and a cheeky wink has usually got me excused for late arrivals, too. Would I attempt any of those things with a male boss? Good God, no! Tell the average Alpha Dog male editor you love his new haircut, and he’ll more than likely swing for you. The magazine writer has never faced the wrath of a female boss - he believes they are harder on women (posed by models) Even the fiercest women are softer on men. In the Nineties I worked under a particularly fearsome female — she’d made her reputation as a girl who could outperform guys, and was determined to show she wouldn’t give anyone an easy ride just because of her chromosomes. Her skirts were tiny, her shoulder pads huge, her language robust, and she strode around daring anyone to deliver anything less than perfection. She was terrifying. Unless, that is, you were a man. I quickly found out that she reserved her greatest fury and harshest standards for the girls. In her view, young women starting out in their careers had to be shown that nothing would come easy — because they were women. She’d had to fight her way to the top and so would they. It’s the same for my friends. We’d never admit to getting on in our careers just because of a willingness to exploit our sexuality, but those of us who have worked under female bosses haven’t been able to resist at least trying it. So give me a strong, powerful woman in charge any day. Especially if I’m one of the few men in the office with her and she’s got a soft spot for talented but occasionally lazy journalists with a tendency to put an inappropriate ‘xx’ on the end of work emails.","Magazine journalist Dominic Utton prefers working for women so he can flirt .

Surrounded by mobiles ringing, emails pinging, screens flickering and worries about work, it is impossible to get enough sleep these days. Or so we tend to believe. In reality, we’re actually getting more shut-eye than we were 30 years ago, a study has claimed. Research has revealed the proportion of adults managing at least nine hours of sleep a night has risen sharply since the early 1980s. New research suggests we get more sleep than we did 30 years ago . One in four now gets a full nine hours on most nights, compared with fewer than one in six in 1983. Meanwhile, the numbers getting by on six hours or fewer has fallen to just 10 per cent, down from 15 per cent three decades ago. The University of Sydney research calls into question the notion that our 24-hour society has disrupted conventional sleeping patterns. Nick Glozier, professor of psychological medicine at the university, said: ‘In the UK, short sleep has been less common in every survey since 1983, but long sleep has been more common. This turns the concept of an increasingly sleep-deprived society on its head.’ Instead, researchers believe the perception that we are all sleeping less stems from the fact that populations in developed countries are ageing and actually need less rest. Sleep deprivation has emerged as a major concern in recent years. In 2010, a team of British and Italian researchers found that regularly getting fewer than six hours a night could increase the risk of premature death by 12 per cent. Sleep deprivation has become a major health concern in recent years . Last year, University of Pennsylvania scientists reported that two hours of missed slumber is enough to stop the brain from laying down and storing memories – and simply dropping from eight hours of sleep to six could make the difference. And a Japanese study found men who snooze for an average of nine hours a night may be half as likely to develop prostate cancer, possibly because lack of sleep may trigger inflammation in blood vessels. But the latest research casts doubt on how many of us are actually affected by sleep deprivation. It pooled data from surveys carried out down the years in the UK as well as Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Holland, Norway, Sweden and the US. ‘We found strong evidence that long sleep durations have become more common in adults in the majority of countries examined,’ the researchers said. ‘But the prevalence of short sleep duration has shown no consistent increase over the last three decades.’ However, they warned that sleeping too long can also be harmful. Previous studies have indicated lying in bed for more than eight or nine hours every night could signal mental health problems, conditions such as diabetes or even the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.","Adults managing at least nine hours a night has risen sharply .

A man has admitted faking his own death after being caught out when he got a speeding ticket four days later. Raymond Roth, 47, had been reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach, New York, while swimming in July last year. Officers . combed the water near the beach during a massive rescue effort but, . days later and 730 miles away from home, Roth was stopped by police for . speeding in South Carolina. Arrested: Raymond Roth is escorted by law enforcement officers after being arrested after he faked his own drowning at a New York beach in a scheme to collect on a life insurance policy . Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced yesterday he has now admitted a conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said. The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. State police arrested both men in last August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence. The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, 'There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here' from the father. But Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme. 'We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,' Davis told CNN on Thursday. 'He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.' Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks. During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said. On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.'He would like to straighten things out with (Jonathan) when the time comes,' he said. Scrum: He was arrested at a hospital where he was receiving psychiatric treatment for depression . Charges: Roth was arraigned on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident . 'Scheme': Roth's son Jonathan, left, and his attorney Joey Jackson after his appearance in court on charges that he helped his father to fake his death. Jonathan claims he was coerced . Days after his disappearance, Raymond Roth was reported to be at a resort in Orlando, Florida and on August 2, he was stopped driving at 90 mph in Santee, South Carolina. When police ran his name, they saw he was listed as missing, but Roth said he was driving back to New York and the officer let him continue. But he failed to show up to a scheduled . meeting with police and his attorney claimed he had in fact been . admitted to hospital with depression. Cost: Tens of thousands of dollars were wasted searching for Roth at Jones Beach, Long Island . Found: Roth left his shoes, wallet, clothing and phone on the beach when attempting to fake his death . Caught: More than a week after his disappearance, Roth was pulled over for speeding in South Carolina . Jonathan Roth, 22, is free on $10,000 bond. He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, filing a false report and other charges. Court papers show he 'was fully aware that his father never walked into the water and had in fact driven off in his own personal vehicle'.. He faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty. The younger Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, said his client and his father had a 'strained' relationship and claims he was coerced into going along with the scheme - which Davis has denied. He also claimed he feared for his life after his father left him a threatening voicemail when the scandal went public. Hurt: Roth's wife Evana said she has received numerous phone calls from him despite court order of protection . Up for sale: Roth had put his Long Island home on the market days before he faked his death and was allegedly calling about the sale . 'Listen, tough guy. You say you’ve been to the Marines and you can kill and everything else. When I get back, you are gonna do just that. One of us is going to die,' Mr Roth allegedly said. Raymond Roth's wife, Evana, said her husband had not told her of the scheme, and handed over emails she found on the family computer that implicated her stepson. In one dated the day before he vanished, the elder Roth told his son to contact him at an Orlando resort to update him on developments following his disappearance. 'This is a terrible nightmare that I just want to wake up from,’ said 43-year-old Evana last week. 'Why did he do this? I think I’m just numb.’ Raymond Roth had put the family's home up for sale just days before he vanished, and Evana Roth also said her husband had recently been fired from his job in New York City. Police estimated that an air and sea search for Roth cost tens of thousands of dollars.","Raymond Roth disappeared on last July during swim with son in Long Island .

The widow of West Virginia sheriff who was murdered while he ate lunch in his car has been appointed to replace her husband as the rural county's top cop. Rosie Crum was sworn into office on Thursday to finish the remainder of of Mingo County Sheriff Eugene Crum's job after county officials agreed she was the best person to continue his legacy of fighting the scourge of prescription pill abuse. Dozens of mourners turned out to pay their respects to Sheriff Crum on Thursday. Carrying on his legacy: Rosie Crum will take over the sheriff's department for her murdered husband Eugene Crum . Killed: Mingo County Sheriff Eugene Crum died of his wounds on Wednesday after being shot on the streets where he regularly parks his car for lunch . Hope: Sidney Ooten, the granddaughter of Mingo County Sheriff Eugene Crum, sang at the memorial service for her slain grandfather . His suspected killer, Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37, remains in critical condition at the hospital after he was shot by a Mingo County deputy following a chase. The Williamson Daily News reports that County Commissioner John Mark Hubbard said: 'After much thought and prayer, the three of us have come to believe that the best plan to fulfill this obligation is with the person who knew Eugene the best. The person who knew his stand on crime and drugs, who knew his plans for Mingo County and who was his best friend and soulmate. 'My recommendation is that we appoint Eugene’s widow, Rosie Crum, to fill his position.' Rosie Crum has no law enforcement experience, though county residents said the sheriff is usually a 'politician-type,' who wasn't already a police officer. Melvin Maynard, the father of Tennis Maynard, said his 37-year-old son developed mental issues after he was exposed to chemicals on a job in an Alabama coal mine. Taking the oath: Rosie Crum, the widow of the murdered Mingo County Sheriff, is sworn in to replace her husband . Mourning: Deputies sobbed as they honors their slain leader at a town memorial service on Thursday . Tragedy: Crum died from his injuries at the scene after leading a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance as part of a campaign pledge . Wounded: Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37, is suspected of killing the sheriff . The elder Maynard would not elaborate . on what kind of mental health problems his son had, although according to a pending lawsuit he was injured in a 2007 explosion caused by a lightning strike at his work. His father says he . believes his son would have shot the first person he saw and Crum's death was not targeted. 'I know he should have been in a hospital,' Melvin said, adding that his son had previously been in an institution. Sheriff Crum led a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance, making good on a campaign pledge, said Delegate Harry Keith White, who . campaigned with Crum last year. He said his friend was shot to death where he regularly parked his patrol vehicle to eat lunch, near the . site of a former pharmacy known for illegally distributing pills. 'I think anybody you ask would tell you he was a great guy, always with a positive attitude, always trying to help people,' White said. 'It's just a sad, sad day for Mingo County and the state of West Virginia.' The suspect, who was shot by a deputy, was taken to a hospital in Logan, said Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's chief of staff Rob Alsop said. Beloved: Friends say anyone who knew Crum would say he was a great guy who was always surrounded by family as a devote grandfather . Promises: Crum led a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance, making good on a campaign pledge last year, he's seen while being sworn in . The suspect wrecked his vehicle while . attempting to flee the scene and was shot after he was seen raising his . weapon, Capt Dave Nelson of the West Virginia State Patrol told CNN. The . courthouse was immediately evacuated, streets into the city were . blocked off and officers held white sheets around the crime scene, . Crum's body further shielded by two vehicles. The shooting occurred within a block of the county courthouse, said Office of Emergency Services head dispatcher Willis Spence. Crum had resigned his post as a county magistrate before launching his sheriff's campaign as a signal of integrity, preferring to run as a civilian rather than an official, White said. He won the primarily handily and ran unopposed in the general election in the fall. Crum had been a magistrate for 12 years and had previously served as police chief in Delbarton. White said Crum was dedicated to improving the community and devoted to his grandchildren and adult children. 'He always had family around him,' he said. After dozens of indictments were issued earlier this year, Prosecutor Michael Sparks issued a press release declaring that Crum 'exceeded my highest expectations' and 'has provided a game changing boost to our drug enforcement program.' Crime scene: Law enforcement officers and emergency service personnel cover the vehicle at the scene of the shooting in downtown Williamson with one suspect in custody . Delegate Justin Marcum, D-Mingo and an assistant county prosecutor, called Crum 'a true friend to the county.' 'He'll be dearly missed,' he said. Williamson, a town of about 3,200, sits along the Tug Fork River in a part of the state long associated with violence. Mingo and neighboring McDowell County are home to the legendary blood feud between the Hatfield family of West Virginia and the McCoy family of Kentucky, a conflict dating to the Civil War. Crum's county was dubbed 'Bloody Mingo' during the early 20th century mine wars, when unionizing miners battled Baldwin-Felts security agents hired by the coal operators. In May 1920, after evicting striking miners in Red Jacket, some of the Baldwin-Felts men tried to board a train in nearby Matewan but were confronted by the mayor and the chief of police, Sid Hatfield, a former miner, who had family ties to the Hatfields in the feud. After a gun battle recreated in the 1987 John Sayles film 'Matewan,' the mayor, two miners, a bystander and three agents lay dead. Hatfield became a hero but was gunned down on the courthouse steps a year later in Matewan. Emergency response: The courthouse just one block away was evacuated, streets into the city were blocked off and officers held white sheets around the crime scene . Though there is no indication of a direct connection, Crum's killing comes on the heels of a Texas district attorney and his wife being shot to death in their home over the weekend, and officials suspect a white supremacist prison gang. Those killings happened a couple of months after 1 of the county's assistant district attorneys was killed near his courthouse office. Colorado's corrections director, Tom Clements, was killed March 19 when he answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs. Two days later, Evan Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected of shooting Clements, died in a shootout about 100 miles from Kaufman. On Monday, judicial officials acknowledged Ebel was freed four years early because of a paperwork error. U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin called Crum's killing 'shocking' and said he's spoken to the State Police, which will lead the investigation. He pledged the assistance of his office and whatever other federal agencies are needed. Over the last century, 14 prosecutors have been killed, according to news reports and statistics kept by the National District Attorneys Association. At least 8 of them were targeted in the line of duty. The Officer Down Memorial Page says 197 police officers in West Virginia have died in the line of duty, 136 of them from deliberate gunfire.","Eugene Crum was known for cracking down on illegal drug trade in West Virginia's coalfields .

Residents in a small village of just 30 homes have accused the National Trust of ruining their tranquillity after allowing a country manor house to open on Sundays. Locals in Chastleton, near Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucester, say keeping Chastleton House open all weekend will overwhelm the village. They fear the village will be swamped with traffic and have accused the National Trust of a lack of consultation. Uproar: Villagers are concerned the extended opening hours of Chastelton House, Gloucester, will lead to an influx of visitors . But the charity says that extending the opening hours will see visitors to the Jacobean manor jump from 26,809 last year to an estimated 30,500. At a parish council meeting with the trust, some of the village's 75 residents aired their views. Councillor Garry Jones said the plan would change the character of the unspoiled Cotswold village. He said: 'How can the village trust the National Trust? 'Villagers are angry at the lack of consultation, lack of response to numerous emails regarding the issue, and complete lack of any form of impact assessment. 'The village's infrastructure cannot cope, and the once green verges of the road into the village have been destroyed.' Chastleton House was built between 1607 and 1612 by a prosperous wool merchant as a statement of his wealth and power. The National Trust has acquired the property in 1991 after the family finances took a turn for the worst. Richard Henderson, the charity's Oxfordshire general manager, said: 'Across the National Trust it's now the norm rather than the exception to open on Sundays. 'We're proposing this for the current visitor season to December. 'We will still maintain a close liaison with the parish council. 'We're keen to work with county highways and the parish to ensure verges and roads are protected where possible.

Staffordshire Police have been deluged with prospective candidates after they announced they were recruiting 14 officers for the first time in three years. Staff have sent out a staggering 1,466 application packs to people who replied to the force's advert for roles. Staffordshire Police has lifted its recruitment freeze - and been flooded with job applicants . It means there are more than 100 people chasing each vacancy which comes with a starting salary of just over £23,500. Chief Constable Mike Cunningham - who has previously called for funding for new recruits - said he was pleased, but not surprised, by the level of interest. He said: 'We were definitely expecting a lot of interest in these jobs. 'The police service has always been seen as a good career and a vocation, especially among those who want to make a positive difference in their communities. 'The state of the economy has obviously played a part in generating this response, but even in times of plenty we get a lot of people applying to join the police. There are more than 100 people chasing each vacancy at Staffordshire Police . 'Having 100 applicants applying for each vacancy means we will be able to find the very best people for these jobs.

A new PC earns £23,259-a-year on appointment, rising to £27,471 after two years in the job. A recruitment freeze was imposed in February 2010, as the force looked to save £38 million by 2015. Staffordshire Police and Crime . Commissioner Matthew Ellis, who was elected last year, ended the . recruitment freeze and the forced retirement of officers with 30 years' service. The decisions mean Staffordshire Police have 50 more officers than they would have otherwise had by this time next year. But the overall number is still expected to fall from 1,814 to 1,786 due to officers leaving and retiring. The number of PCSOs is set to remain at 209, while police staff numbers are expected to fall from 1,153 to 1,135. Staffordshire Police Federation . chairman Andy Adams said: 'I think policing is still a career people are . interested in. We've had a list of people asking when the police will . start recruiting again. 'I . am really pleased that we've had such a good response to these new . vacancies. I would like to see the overall number of officers to stay . the same, rather than fall. 'The amount of crime doesn't fall, and so it means there is more work for those officers we do have.' In a similar scenario, a new sofa shop which advertised just nine jobs was inundated with more than 1,200 applicants. The new branch of furniture superstore DFS is due to open in Bristol on April 14 and had a handful of positions still available. While people rushed for Staffordshire Police jobs, a desperate 4,000 job seekers flocked to a Hampshire hotel in the hope of finding work at a new shopping centre . But when it advertised the nine jobs 1,200 people applied - including 610 for one position as a warehouse assistant. In total 79 people applied to be a salesman, 137 as a sales office administrator, 62 as a weekend sales office administrator, three as an upholsterer and 88 as a cleaner. Another 42 people applied to be a warehouse manager, 610 as a warehouse assistant, 131 as a van driver and 70 as a co-driver. The figures show the number of people competing to find work - even as official statistics say unemployment in the area is falling. DFS regional controller Adam Hankinson said: 'We were surprised at first but this is a trend we have been witnessing around the country as new stores open. 'We understand this is a difficult time for people looking for jobs with the economy as it is.' The situation is similar to the rush for jobs in Whitley. Yesterday, 4,000 job seekers flocked to a hotel in the hope of finding work at a new £84 million shopping centre. Queues formed as people were desperate to try and get work. The desperate job hunt was echoed in Staffordshire . Long . queues started to build two hours before the jobs fair at the Solent . Hotel, in Whiteley, Hampshire, as the work went up for grabs. The . turn-out was so strong a one-in-one out policy was enforced, as eager . job seekers tried to land employment the new shopping centre. As the unemployment catastrophe rumbles on, an international watchdog has predicted that the bleak outlook looks set to stay. The . US and Japan will lead the recovery among advanced economies but the . turnaround in Europe will take longer, The Organisation for Economic . Co-operation and Development warned yesterday. It said the outlook in the G7 is improving after the slump at the end of last year. But it claimed that vast swathes of the eurozone remained deep in recession and urged the European Central Bank to cut interest rates to stimulate growth. ‘The global economy weakened again in late 2012, but activity is now picking up in many major economies,’ said Pier Carlo Padoan, the think tank’s deputy general secretary and chief economist. ‘The outlook in the first half of 2013 is for a return to moderate growth in the US and an acceleration from low levels in Japan. ‘In Europe, a meaningful recovery is likely to take somewhat longer. Within the euro area, there is a renewed divergence between growth in Germany, which is likely to pick up strongly, and that of other countries, which will remain slow or negative.’ The OECD forecast annual growth of 3.5pc in the US in the first quarter of 2013, 3.2 per cent in Japan and 2.3 per cent in Germany. It said Britain would avoid a triple-dip recession, with annual growth of 0.5 per cent. But it said the French economy would decline by 0.6 per cent and the Italian economy by 1.6 per cent. The Paris-based OECD said that output across the G7 fell at an annual rate of 0.5 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 but predicted growth of 2.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent in the first and second quarters of 2013. ‘We are moderately more optimistic,’ said Padoan. ‘We see growth firming in the US, we see more growth in Japan, and we see more growth in Germany.’ He added that ‘some scope remains’ for the ECB to cut interest rates.","More than 100 people competing for each role at Staffordshire Police .

A former professor charged with viewing child pornography from his first-class seat on a commercial flight to Boston will be spared his jail sentence if he sticks to the terms of his probation. A Boston judge suspended Grant Smith's 2 1/2-year sentence after the Salt Lake City father of two pleaded guilty on Thursday to possessing child pornography. Smith is instead placed on five years' probation, must continue sex offender treatment, comply with Utah sex offender registry requirements and follow restrictions on contact with children and Internet use. Off the hook: Grant Smith, 50, a former engineering professor at the University of Utah, pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography on Thursday sparing him jail time . Smith, 50, was a University of Utah engineering professor, recently divorced, before he resigned from his position several weeks after his 2011 arrest and being placed on administrative leave. A fellow first-class passenger reported Smith viewing pornographic images of young girls on his laptop during a November flight, according to prosecutors. Caught: The divorced father of two young children was arrested after a fellow passenger on a flight into Boston saw him looking at the photos on his laptop while in first class in 2011 . Delta passenger Kurt Wade, who broke down in tears while recounting the experience, took a cell phone photo of Smith viewing the pictures before alerting a flight attendant. 'He kept scrolling through the pictures and they became sexual and explicit,' Wade told Fox News. 'Little by little they were semi-nude, then completely nude. Just terrible, terrible stuff. It was kind of sad. Tough stuff to see,' he said. Wade says Smith began to erase the files after a flight attendant told him to turn off his computer that was purchased with grant money while an adjunct professor. 'Even as I was trying to explain it [to an air steward], I broke down. I couldn't contain it. So disturbing what was going on,' said Wade. He also alerted police himself, sending officers to greet their plane at its arrival at Boston Logan International Airport. He added: 'When I was in the interview room with forensic computer police down the hall, they confirmed for me there were other images of sexual activity with grown ups.' When asked if he considered himself a hero, he added: 'No. I think any common sense person would see this and understand what was going on.' Speaking to the Associated Press, Wade added: ‘I feel bad for a lot of people but mostly for these innocent girls. He’s got two young kids and these kids are innocent victims of their father’s behaviour.’ Horrific: Fellow passenger Kurt Wade broke down in tears while recounting the disturbing images he saw on Smith's computer that he says grew worse and worse . The images were mostly of girls between eight and 10 years old, naked or nearly naked, engaging in simulated sex acts. 'These weren't photos of a child in the bath that a parent might keep,' Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said of the images. 'These were explicitly sexual and extremely disturbing.' Some of the pictures were of children as young as six, the prosecutor said. All files were ones downloaded from a website but police say they also found photos on his cell phone of young girls seen in parks and airports. Attorney and victim's advocate Wendy Murphy told WCVB at the time: 'The notion that someone would be so bold as to view it in public is extraordinary and I'm not sure what the explanation is. 'What we have is the equivalent of a confession. Someone who not only sees it but is smart enough to take a picture of it is very solid evidence. 'Reporting it immediately to law enforcement, law enforcement then being able to do their own immediate investigation - that's a very strong case - at least at this point.' Investigators from Massachusetts State Police told NewsCenter 5's Cheryl Fiandaca that Smith was travelling to Boston to attend a conference for the Material Research Society. Smith, a materials science and engineering professor, has two bachelor’s degrees and a doctorate, and had worked at the university for 14 years.","Grant Smith, 50, has jail sentence suspended by judge so long he sticks to the terms of his five-year probation .

A driver has been killed after a high-speed commuter train hit a car on a level crossing in Somerset. Police, fire crews and ambulance services were called to the crash involving the First Great Western Exeter to London Paddington service at around 6.30am this morning. The red car, believed to be a Peugeot 306, was shunted more than a mile down the tracks as a result of the collision. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The First Great Western train was bound for Paddington this morning when it hit the red car in Somerset . A recovery vehicle removes the wreckage of the car from the tracks following the fatal collision . British Transport Police said the man was pronounced dead at the scene. It is understood the half-road barriers were down at the time of the incident at the crossing near Athelney on the line between Taunton and Castle Cary which has been categorised as 'non suspicious'. The car was trapped under the front of the Paddington-bound train and firefighters worked all morning to cut it free. Aaron Mead, who lives 100 yards from the scene, told the BBC he heard an 'almighty bang'. 'A couple of pictures on the bedside table fell over,' he said. 'Before we knew it we had endless amounts of sirens - police cars, fire engines and ambulances bombing up and down the road.' Fatal: Emergency services at the scene near Athelney, Somerset, where a man has died after his car was hit by a train . The senior fire commander at the scene Paul Cregan said: 'The train struck the vehicle and then carried it along the tracks, eventually stopping over a mile from the crossing. 'Firefighters had to run to the scene carrying firefighting and rescue equipment to deal with the person trapped in the car, deal with the very real risk of a fire occurring as well as dealing with nearly 40 people on the train in terrible weather conditions. 'This incident was a significant challenge causing a number of dangerous and difficult circumstances for our Fire and Rescue crews.' Network Rail said an investigation has . been launched but the focus will be on actions of the driver rather than . the working of the crossing. Witnesses said the barriers at the level crossing were lowered when the car drove on to the track. A spokesman for Network Rail added: 'There were 45 people on board, comprising 37 passengers and eight train crew. 'The train did not derail and no passengers or crew were injured. 'The train driver and First Great . Western staff gave a statement to British Transport Police that . the barriers were lowered and the car was seen to drive on to the . crossing.' James Hector, owner of Willowbank Services less than a mile from the scene, said the barriers close very quickly. 'It's a very fast crossing,' he said. 'Once the barriers go down the train is there within 30 seconds. 'They are half-road barriers so it would be possible to drive around them, but you would have no chance if you did.' First Great Western said none of the 37 passengers or eight crew were injured in the crash. After almost six hours waiting on the train, they were taken back to Taunton train station. Scene: A street view of the Athelney level crossing in Somerset where the fatal accident happened . Stuart Lambert, a passenger on the train, was on his way to London for a training course when the tragedy happened. The teacher, 37, from Taunton, said: . 'I was sitting at the back of the train, just dozing, when I felt a . shudder and the brakes slam on. 'The train came to a controlled stop . some distance later, where the announcer told us that someone had jumped . the level crossing. 'We were told to move to the front of the train, where they kept us calm and refreshed, and kept everyone well informed.'. Stuart added: 'A lot of people were . shaken up, understandably, but the staff were absolutely brilliant and . kept everyone calm and comfortable.' A group of schoolchildren from Isca . College of Media Arts in Exeter were on the train travelling to Radio 1 . for BBC School Report. One of them, a 15 year old called . Denis, said: 'We heard a loud bang.

Audiences of BBC children's show Blue Peter are being forced to go through security scanners over fears members of the public may bring dangerous objects and weapons into the studio. The new security measures at the CBBC studios have been implemented since the Jeremy Kyle Show began filming at the same location last month. Now panel members and audiences have to enter the studios through 'airport-style x-ray machines' as a result of the controversial ITV chat show moving to Blue Tower Studios in Salford’s Media City. Weapons scare: Audiences off children's show Blue Peter, presented by Barney Harwood and Helen Skelton, now have to be checked for weapons since the Jeremy Kyle Show moved in to their studios . Previously, the Manchester studios were home to Blue Peter and other CBBC programmes, but since Jeremy Kyle's move from ITV's Granada, new safety measures have been put in place. 'It's like the studio has gone on lockdown, with everything needing to be bolted to the floor so it’s not stole,' a source told The Sun. 'It all seems a little ridiculous, but I guess they’ve got to be careful with the guests on Jeremy Kyle. 'The famous Blue Peter Garden is just outside – so you can imagine the atmosphere is now very different.' Controversy: The new security measures have been described as 'requirements' for the Jeremy Kyle Show . ITV told the paper the new security measures are 'required' for the controversial television show, which is not foreign to guests getting physical on set. The Jeremy Kyle show, previously . branded 'a form of human bear baiting,' by a Manchester judge, has seen several convictions of assault following violence on set. Earlier this month Jason McPartland, 41, told a . court he was 'goaded' by production staff into punching a relative's . ex-boyfriend in front of a baying audience. The show, which was never broadcast, on the theme ‘You can’t stop me seeing our children just because you . hate my new girlfriend!’ was filmed last summer. After the hearing, an ITV spokesman said: ‘The Jeremy Kyle Show does not show violence and  neither does it condone it.’ Previous court cases involving the . show include and assault case in 2007, where David Staniforth, 45, . headbutted Larry Mahoney, a lodger who had an affair with his wife, at . the studios.

DNA tests have confirmed a prominent Al-Qaeda leader was killed by French and Chadian troops in northern Mali, the French President confirmed today. Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, senior commander in Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was killed among 40 other Islamist fighters last month in the foothills of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains. In a statement the office of French . president Francois Hollande said the death was 'definitively confirmed' and that Abou Zeid's death 'marks an important step in the fight against . terrorism in the Sahel'. Scroll down for video . Serious blow: Abou Zeid, one of the leaders of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was killed by French and Chadian troops in the mountains in northern Mali . Chad's president had said earlier this month that Chadian troops had . killed Abou Zeid while fighting to dislodge an al-Qaida affiliate in . northern Mali. French officials have maintained for weeks that Abou Zeid . was 'probably' dead but waited to conduct DNA tests to verify. Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, thought to be 47, was a pillar of the southern . realm of al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, responsible for the . death of at least two European hostages and a leader of the extremist . takeover of northern Mali. He was killed in operations in the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains in . northern Mali in late February, the statement from Hollande's office . said. The French military moved into Mali on January 11 to push back militants . linked to Abou Zeid and other extremist groups who had imposed harsh . Islamic rule and who are seen as an international terrorist threat. Abou Zeid led one of the most violent brigades of al Qaida's North . African franchise. He was believed to be holding four French nationals . kidnapped two years ago at a uranium mine in Niger. The fate of those . hostages, working for French company Areva, was unclear. Fatal battle: The French President Frncois Hollande confirmed today that Abou Zeid, pictured, was 'definitely confirmed' Alleged murder: Abou Zeid is said to have been the one to execute British hostage Edwin Dyer in 2009 . Abou Zeid held a Frenchman released in February 2010, and another who . was executed that July. He's also been linked to the execution of a . British hostage in 2009. A powerful and shadowy figure, mystery surrounds even his real name. Along with his nom de guerre, Abou Zeid had an alias, Mosab . Abdelouadoud, and nicknames, the emir of the south and the little emir, . due to his diminutive size. But the Algerian press has raised questions . about his legal identity - Abid Hamadou or Mohamed Ghedir. He was viewed as a disciplined radical with close ties to the overall . AQIM boss, Abdelmalek Droukdel, who oversees operations from his post in . northern Algeria. Abou Zeid fought with a succession of Islamist insurgency movements . trying to topple the Algerian state since 1992. He reportedly joined the . brutal, and now defunct, Armed Islamic Group that massacred whole . villages in northern Algeria, then joined the Salafist Group for Call . and Combat that morphed into al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in 2006. An Algerian court tried him in absentia in January 2012, convicting him . of belonging to an international terrorist group and sentencing him to . life in prison. After a loose alliance of Islamist . groups seized northern Mali from April last year, Abou Zeid took control . of the ancient desert trading town of Timbuktu, employing a violently . extreme form of sharia, including amputations and the destruction of . ancient Sufi shrines. Confirmed: Abou Zeid was among 40 militants killed last month in the foothills of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains . Timbuktu . elders who dealt directly with him during the Islamist occupation . described a short man with a grey beard and a quiet, severe manner who . was never seen without an AK-47 rifle. Locals . said that when he fled Timbuktu, before the town fell to the French-led . military advance, he took several blindfolded Western hostages in his . convoy. Born in 1965 in the Debdab region of Algeria's Illizi province, close to the Libyan border, Abou Zeid joined the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) during the 1990s civil war, which later transformed itself into AQIM. Abou Zeid is regarded by some as one of AQIM's radicals, unwilling to negotiate or make concessions. Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler, in an . account of his kidnapping by another Islamist cell in the Sahara, . recounted how Abou Zeid refused to give medication to two hostages . suffering from dysentery, one of whom had been stung by a scorpion. Abou Zeid is reported to have a strong rivalry with Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the mastermind of the mass hostage taking at the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria last month, due to the latter's decision to found his own brigade last year.","French President says death of Al-Qaeda leader  'definitely confirmed'

Police were then called after one of the men allegedly assaulted Thompson during the incident on November 21 last year. He was later charged with being in possession of a stun gun after the device was recovered at Grampian Police headquarters. Thompson admitted the offence when he appeared in court in February. He also admitted assaulting a constable by spitting at him on the same date and acting in a threatening manner towards officers at the police station. Sentencing: David Thompson, left, is facing a minimum of five years in prison for possession of the modified stun gun, right . Defence lawyer Gary Foulis argued that his client had not set out to get his hands on a stun gun which was disguised as a mobile phone. Defence lawyers for Thompson, pictured, had argued his case was 'out of the ordinary' He said that the device was not a barrelled weapon that fired bullets which could cause serious damage. The Firearms Act 2003 offence carries a minimum five year jail sentence unless the court decides there are exceptional circumstances. But Mr Foulis said a five year sentence would be 'disproportionate' given the circumstances of the case. He said: 'This is a scenario that is certainly out of the ordinary.' However, fiscal depute David Bernard argued there were no exceptional circumstances to the case and said Thompson could have handed the stun gun in. Sheriff Christopher Shead sentenced Thompson to five years in prison. Chief Inspector George MacDonald, from Grampian Police, said: 'Thankfully incidents of this type are rare within the city and I believe the sentence sends out a strong message to any individuals who concern themselves with weapons of any description. 'Through excellent joint working we have seen significant reductions in violence in Aberdeen city centre and across the city as a whole. 'However, we will continue to target the small number who choose to involve themselves  in violence, drugs, and anti-social behaviour and, as the public expect of us, lock the perpetrators up.' Police forces across the UK have seen a growing number of stun guns disguised as mobile phones on Britain's streets in recent years. Marketed in the U.S. as self-defence weapons, they can be bought online and delivered to the UK for as little as £9. Police fear as many as 10,000 could be out on the streets. One website MailOnline visited said: 'A cell phone stun gun will cause your attacker pain and leave them temporarily immobilized and disoriented, but cause them no permanent damage.' But such stun guns are classed as firearms under UK law and possession carries a minimum jail sentence of five years and maximum of up to ten years. There is also concern that potentially lethal weapons, some 20 times more powerful than the Taser guns used by police, can easily be brought into the UK. A Mail investigation in January uncovered a German website selling 1million volt stun guns which could be mail delivered into Britain with a free can of pepper spray. They are highly prized by members of the criminal underworld as an alternative to guns and knives. In the last three years the Met police force has seized 498 stun guns in London alone.","David Thompson, 35, told court he stole phone from nightclub in Aberdeen .

A comic book fan has become the proud owner of a full-sized, working replica of the Batmobile, but will have to wait a few years before he can use it to catch criminals as he is only six years old. Alfie Wilde is the envy of the school after his grandfather converted an old Daihatsu into the iconic superhero car. Alan Dennett, 63, spent more than £5,000 so that his grandchild could dress up and act out his favourite fight scenes from the Caped Crusader comics. Little hero: Young Batman fan Alfie sits behind the wheel of his very own Batmobile, custom made for him by his grandfather . Alfie even has his own Batcave - his grandfather’s garage in Rhyl, North Wales - and he travels from his family home near Manchester most weekend’s to get behind the wheel of his Batmobile. Mr Dennett, a retired mechanic, converted the old Daihatsu after the car failed its MOT, modelling it on the old fashioned Lincoln Futura driven by Adam West in the 1960s TV series. He cut off the roof, adding a red trim, wings, an elaborate exhaust and a custom windscreen, as well as flashing lights, a red Batphone and Batman's iconic logo stuck on the steering wheel. Mr Dennett said: ‘When we gave the car to him he was absolutely amazed. ‘He couldn't believe his eyes, he was so excited, it was worth all the effort just to see the look on his face.' Batman and Alan: Alfie with his grandfather Allan Bennett who spent £5,000 to turn his old Daihatsu into the iconic car, outside Mr Bennett's home in Rhyl, Wales . Bat-fan: Alfie, who lives near Manchester, visits his grandfather in Wales most weekends to play with his car . Dark squire: Despite being eleven years away from a licence, Alfie is the proud owner of a car, and his grandfather believes he will be able to take it on the road in the future . ‘He loves Batman but he tells me that I'm his real hero now. He comes down whenever he can he loves playing games in the car. ‘He . sits in the drive pretending to be batman, singing the theme song and . acting out fight scenes, shouting ‘Kapow, smash, biff, boff’. ‘It's a big toy for him, something that he will remember all his life.’ Although not allowed on the road lacking an MOT, Alan believes with a few minor . modifications the Batmobile will be road worthy. Thankfully, Alan has plenty of time to make the changes as it will be another 11 years before Alfie is eligible to apply for a driving licence. Fighting crime: The Batmobile comes complete with a warning, flashing light and a Batphone . Original: Alfie's Batmobile is modelled on the classic version from the 1960s television series starring Burt Ward and Adam West . In the meantime, Alfie, from Heywood, Greater Manchester, and the Batmobile will be forced to remain on the drive, but this does not seem to damped the mood of the six-year-old. Alfie said: ‘It's great, I love it. I have been into Batman since I was two. ‘It is brilliant, I really enjoyed getting in it. I like Batman because he is a hero.’ His proud grandfather added: ‘He first got into Batman by watching the original TV series, he started watching it when he got home from school. ‘That's the one he loves, he isn't really a fan of the Dark Knight Rises.’","Alfie Wilde, 6, has a fully functioning Batmobile, thanks to his grandfather .

An injured fisherman caught in bad weather on the Irish Sea has to be winched to safety as the 17ft waves threatened to sink his boat. Due to the rough sea, a 3,500 tonne Royal Navy vessel had to be called in to provide shelter as the rescue team struggled to get to the French fisherman in time. The coastguard had already scrambled both an RAF search and rescue helicopter and an RNLI lifeboat to rescue the fisherman, but weather conditions were deteriorating fast. Saving the French: The RAF helicopter evacuated the French crewman using a winch following a difficult rescue mission in the stormy weather . Royal Navy Hydrographic survey vessel, . HMS Echo, was carrying out maritime security operations when she . received a request for assistance from Milford Haven Coastguard. The 17-ft high swell meant it was not possible to lower a winchman safely onto the vessel’s deck and assist the fisherman who was showing signs of hypothermia. Once Echo was called in the 3,500 tonne ship attempted to provide some shelter for the RNLI lifeboat to get alongside the French fishing vessel, Alf, but once again the weather prevented a rescue. This left them with no choice but to escort the fishing vessel closer inland before the helicopter was able to winch the injured fisherman to safety. Dangerous mission: A gigantic wave nearly swallows the boat as the RAF helicopter hovers nearby to save the French fisherman . Distress call: The helicopter closes in on the French fishing boat as it is battered in the rough waves . With 59 crew members on board, HMS Echo . was fortunate to have Gunnery Officer, Lieutenant Adam Butler, among the . Ship's Company. Lt Butler studied French at University College London before joining the Royal Navy and was able to translate what the French crew were saying. Lt Butler said: ‘It’s not often that I get to use my language skills in my current job, but this was a refreshing change. ‘I'm just pleased we were able to assist another mariner in his time of need.’ Search and rescue: The rough sea meant a tricky operation which saw 3,500 tonne HMS Echo called in to provide shelter for the RNLI lifeboat . Lt Cdr Karen Fyfe, HMS Echo's Executive Officer, added: ‘The safety of life at sea remains the responsibility of every mariner - HMS Echo was the right ship, in the right place, at the right time. ‘We have the expertise onboard to enable the ship's company to make an immediate impact on the lives of those unfortunate enough to have been caught up in the incident on the fishing vessel. ‘I am pleased that we were able to provide valuable and timely support to fellow mariners. ‘This is what our people in the Royal Navy are trained to do, and do well.’ However, this was not the only incident where French fishermen found themselves in trouble on the Irish Sea.

Expensive holiday: Georgia Harris' phone was stolen in Barcelona and while she was in the air on her way back to Britain the thieves racked up a £21,000 bill . A recruitment worker whose phone was stolen while she was on holiday is facing a £21,000 bill. Georgia Harris racked up the huge bill after her mobile was taken and then used to make premium rate international calls. The 23-year-old realised her phone had been taken when she arrived back in Britain after a trip to Barcelona. She lost her phone in the morning and the thief only took a few hours while she was in the air to rack up the staggering bill. As soon as Miss Harris realised her Samsung Galaxy had been stolen, she immediately called police and her phone company to report the theft and visited a store a few hours later to pick up a replacement. She discovered the thief’s abuse of her account when Vodafone staff informed her that it had been suspended for ‘suspicious activity’. They revealed her service had been stopped when the bill totalled £21,183.82. Records show the thief had used the phone for several conference calls to premium rate international numbers from 7.52am on the day it was lost. Miss Harris, from Worthing, West Sussex, arrived at Gatwick Airport a few hours later, following a holiday in Barcelona to celebrate a friend's birthday, at around 1pm, reporting the theft shortly after. She said: ‘I went into the store to pick up my replacement phone and the customer assistant told me that the phone had been locked. ‘He looked at the account further and his mouth dropped open. I thought that someone might have used the phone and racked up a bill of hundreds of pounds. ‘But then he said it was £21,000. I just couldn't believe it. I phoned Vodafone and they kept saying that I was liable to the point when I reported it stolen. ‘I didn't realise it was stolen until I reached Gatwick. They kept talking about payment plans. It is such a lot of money. ‘I didn't think it was possible to run up such a huge bill. It is the size of a house deposit.’ Miss Harris was shocked when Vodafone customer services insisted that she was responsible for the bill, saying the company should have suspended the account earlier. ‘A couple of hundreds of pounds maybe, or a thousand, but £21,000 is crazy. High fees: Georgia's Samsung Galaxy was used to make premium rate international conference calls . ‘I just can't believe they didn't suspend the account when it began running into thousands of pounds. ‘Vodafone said that because I was abroad, it didn't show up on my bill for 24 hours. I find it hard that a global company in an age where everything is instant can say that. ‘I shouldn't have to pay for their computer system not updating.’ Vodafone initially offered to reduce Miss Harris' bill by £1,500 as a ‘goodwill gesture’ - leaving her to pay more than £19,500, but after investigation a the company said that all fees to her account will be waived. A spokesman  said: ‘This is a very unusual case. Normally, the customer is liable for any charges up to the point they report their phone lost or stolen. ‘However, this phone seems to have been used as part of a deliberate and organised crime which we will be investigating. ‘In this case, we will waive all of the charges raised by this fraud. ‘It's worth remembering how important it is to keep your phone safe, and get in touch with us as soon as you suspect it's missing.’","Georgia Harris's phone was stolen in Barcelona on day she left for the UK .

A former England cricketer has been convicted of harassment after putting a picture of his ex-wife next to an image of a witch in his car. Kim Barnett, 52, who played for Derbyshire and Gloucestershire, displayed the two pictures, with the slogan  ‘Which is Witch?' written alongside them, in full view of passers-by. He was fined was fined £380 after pleading guilty to harassing his former partner Janet Barnett during August and September last year. Mr Barnett, of Leek, Staffordshire, also admitted driving his car past his . ex-wife’s home on several occasions despite being issued with a . harassment warning in April last year. Prosecutor Leanne Jones told magistrates sitting in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire that the retired cricketer, who played in four Test Matches for England in 1988 and 1989, had been suffering from mental health difficulties after the break-up of his marriage. Defence solicitor David Green said Barnett, who separated from his wife in 2004 and went through divorce proceedings in 2010, retired from professional cricket in 2003 after a 25-year career. Describing Barnett as a man of ‘impeccable’ character, Mr Green told the court: ‘It’s fair to say that Mr Barnett found the break-up extremely difficult to deal with. ‘These incidents occurred in the aftermath of the break-up and everything else that happened as a result of that.’ During his submissions, Mr Green stressed that the course of conduct admitted by Barnett did not involve any direct contact with his ex-wife. The two images were seen in his vehicle by Mrs Barnett, who also lives in Leek, on both September 13 and 14 last year. Addressing the ‘ill-thought out’ pictures placed in his client’s car, Mr Green added: ‘We have two incidents on two separate days which are in my submission quite bizarre, but also in some ways quite childish.’ Magistrates were told that the . Professional Cricketers’ Association had supported Barnett through his . health problems, which included a ‘stress-related’ heart attack in 2011. Fallen hero: Kim Barnett, pictured second from left during his cricket glory days, was fined £380 after pleading guilty to harassing his former partner Janet Barnett . It also emerged during the court hearing that Barnett, who works as a cricket coach, has no income during the winter months.

Williams and Fox went on ’an appalling catalogue’ of burglaries, using some of the £1,910 they stole from their frail victims to buy a PlayStation. Callous: Care worker Michelle Williams used her own keys to enter the homes of the pensioners she was meant to care for while her boyfriend Terence Fox stood guard outside . A court heard Williams would enter the homes of the elderly people she was meant to care for while Fox stood outside and held a torch to guide her as she carried out the thefts.

When he asked care staff the next day they confirmed there had been no call-out in the middle of the night.’ Williams and Fox, of Morriston, Swansea, held hands and cried in the dock as the court heard they escaped with £1,910 from their frail and elderly victims. Judge Keith Thomas said the pair had carried out ‘an appalling catalogue’ of burglaries, preying on vulnerable people in their 80s. Williams admitted eight burglaries and one attempted burglary, Fox, pleaded guilty to seven burglaries and one attempted burglary. Williams was sentenced to two years in jail and Fox was jailed for 20 months.","Michelle Williams, 30, used her own keys to gain access to victims' homes .

The choice of a Pope from Latin America is a powerful symbol of the shift of influence in Roman Catholicism from the old to the new world. Jorge Mario Bergoglio is the third Pontiff in a row who is not from Italy and the first in more than a millennium from outside Europe. His election to the Papacy signals the importance of the burgeoning strength of the church in Latin America and in Africa, now home to a growing proportion of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics. Balance of power: Newly elected Pope Francis I waves to the waiting crowd from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica . The election of the first Jesuit to the Papacy also represents the triumph of the order founded nearly 500 years ago, which has for centuries concentrated on mission around the globe, and particularly in the Americas. It also points to the rising economic influence of Latin America where Brazil has joined the list of booming nations with fast-rising levels of wealth. Although Argentina lags behind in economic terms, the election of the new Pope Francis says that Latin America is no longer a sideshow in terms of world power. The election was greeted with joy in Buenos Aires where the shifting centre of gravity was taken as an occasion of deep national pride. Cardinal Bergoglio has European links to satisfy conservatives who would worry about the risks of too great a break with tradition. The child of Italian immigrants, from a country with deep Italian connections, he has a cultural background that will be familiar and comfortable for many in the Curia. Many will regard the choice of the new Pope as a compromise between the safety-first option of an Italian or European candidate and the radical departure that picking a Pontiff from the rising churches of Africa would have represented. A number of cardinals from the developing world, including Ghanaian Peter Turkson, had been mentioned as candidates. Cardinal Turkson fired the first shot in the battle to succeed Benedict XVI when he said ‘young churches’ of Africa and Asia were ready to provide worldwide leadership for Roman Catholicism.

Developers are building homes on green fields rather than on derelict sites in towns and cities because of new Government planning rules, a report said yesterday. It said that the Whitehall push for a construction boom is overriding concerns that ‘brownfield’ sites should be used first. The report from the National Trust and a local government think-tank said developers are successfully arguing that they can only build on green fields by claiming that brownfield projects would lose money. Developers are building on green land instead of derelict sites, a charity says (file picture) The claim by the charity and the Local Government Information Unit, a body largely funded by local councils, adds to the pressure on ministers over the new planning rules, brought in a year ago amid a wave of criticism. Opponents say the rules will lead to building over large areas of countryside against the wishes of those living in the suburban and rural areas. Ministers anxious to provide more and cheaper homes for a fast-rising population have told councils to produce local plans which include room for large-scale housing projects. Their rules also say planning decisions should be biased in favour of ‘sustainable’ development, a rule which conservationists say simply means the planning system will be skewed in favour of builders. Developers claim the new system led to a 45 per cent increase in the number of projects given the go-ahead last autumn. Chancellor George Osborne added to the new homes push in the Budget by offering interest-free state loans for five years to those who buy new houses or flats. The loans will be worth 20 per cent of the value of homes costing up to £600,000. The South Downs in Sussex. The National Trust claim new rules mean areas of countryside will be built on . Communities Secretary Eric Pickles insisted every area of brownfield land is being used . Yesterday’s report said the National Planning Policy Framework is tipping the scales against brownfield development because it requires councils to produce local plans including housebuilding that can be completed inside five years. This means that 400,000 sites across the country which already have planning permission for homes are unlikely to be included in development plans because builders say it will be too expensive to start construction inside five years. Brownfield sites are more expensive than virgin land because they need to be cleared and cleaned. ‘The fact that greenfield sites are more profitable to develop than brownfield sites, and therefore more viable, is forcing councils to propose development of these sites,’ the report said. Peter Nixon of the National Trust, said: ‘We are very concerned that the principal of “brownfield first” is being eroded as the new plans emerge. ‘Our research suggests a growing number of greenfield sites are being prioritised for development with developers arguing that brownfield sites – many of which already have planning permission for construction – are now unprofitable to build on.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has insisted ‘we are making the most of every single square inch of brownfield land’.","The National Trust say new Government planning rules are to blame .

From the age of four Bobby dressed as a boy, he dated girls as he got older and at the age of 15 he decided to begin hormone treatment to become a fully-fledged man. He is now living as man while he waits for full sex change surgery and while Bobby has always had the full support of his mother Tracey Wood in his quest to change his sex, in another twist Bobby has fallen in love with Tracey's best friend Donna Price. Scroll down for video . Bobby Barnes (left) who was born a girl but lives as a man is now engaged to marry his mother Tracey's best friend Donna (middle) Donna knew Bobby as a young girl but lost touch with the family until she met Bobby again last year. The two of them got together after a chance meeting in a pub and now have Tracey's blessing to get married. Today the trio from Worcester appeared on This Morning to explain how they are delighted to be part of such a modern romance. Bobby and Donna met years after Donna had lost touch with his mother Tracey, and fell in love immediately . Mother Tracey, who has four other sons and one daughter, told hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'I always knew,. He was always a tomboy. 'He was misbehaving one day when he was little and I said ""What do I have to do to make you behave?"" he told me that he wanted to have a boy's haircut and a boy's school uniform like his brothers and so that's what I did.' 'It has never been a secret. I always said not to lie about anything, just be honest.' Bobby, who like the rest of the family spent most of the interview grinning, said: 'From day one I always felt this. It just came naturally. 'It has been a bit of a struggle, but with my mum's support it went quite smoothly. 'I got a bit of gip at school, but the more I have explained to people the better it has been.' Bobby says that he knew from the age of four that he should have been born a man . Donna, who was understandably nervous about getting back in touch with Tracey after meeting and falling for Bobby, joked: 'I went with Tracey to get his first short back and sides!'

Donna said: 'I bumped in to him, said 'alright bab', I didn't think I would be walking out of the pub with him because I was there to kiss someone else! 'But then Bobby spun me around and just kissed me. Donna admitted that she was nervous about seeing Tracey again and admitting that she was in love with Bobby but Tracey said she is delighted that they are together as Donna already knows everything . 'I was scared because his mum Tracey was my old friend and I have known him from such a young age ... but I don't need to care about people's feelings now as long as I know I love him, because we are going to spend the rest of our lives together.

More than a third of councils will be putting their tax bills up next week in defiance of calls by the Government for a continued freeze. In total, 124 councils are increasing their bills – some by nearly 4 per cent. Many households will be forced to pay up to £50 more on their annual bills, despite the Prime Minister’s insistence that they should not go up. Government figures show how bills have risen more slowly since the general election, which ministers say amounts to a 9.7 per cent real terms cut . Councils must call a local referendum . to get the approval of voters if they want to put bills up by more than 2 . per cent, under rules set by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. But the 22 councils that have imposed . rises greater than 2 per cent have dodged the rules by loading costs on . to unelected quangos that can set their portion of the tax bill without . having to face voters. As a result, these councils do not need to hold a referendum. In Greater Manchester, for example, . the waste disposal board has put its council tax demand up by nearly 20 . per cent and the transport authority by nearly 6 per cent. This means Manchester council has put . its bills up by 3.9 per cent, nearly double the official cap, and an . increased burden of more than £50 for a band D council tax payer. In other areas, fire or police . authority bills have gone up steeply and led to 2 per cent-plus rises in . council tax bills. This means that across areas including Manchester, . West Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire and Berkshire, householders will face . rises of more than £30 and in some cases more than £50 on the benchmark . band D bills. Many parish councils, which are also exempt from the 2 per cent rule, have raised their council tax demands. Yesterday, the Communities Department . revealed that 41 per cent of billing authorities, including fire and . police authorities and  council quangos, have ignored the call for a . freeze. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles offered councils financial help if they froze bills, but only two thirds took it up . The average increase was 0.8 per cent, with an average band D bill coming in at £1,456, compared with £1,444 last year. Across all council tax bands from A to H, the average household bill will be £1,045. The increase is the biggest in the . three years since the Coalition took power. Council tax for 2011-12, its . first year in charge, was frozen across the country. Last year the . average rise was 0.3 per cent. But councils have been resisting . pressure to keep the tax down. They do not like the reward offered by . the Treasury for freezing it – a one-off grant worth 1 per cent of . council tax – because it means council tax rises in future years will be . worth less. Any council which puts up the tax this year will have a higher base on which to impose rises next year. Yesterday, ministers tried to direct attention to the majority of councils that have frozen the tax. They claimed that after taking . inflation into account, the average council tax bill has gone down  in . real terms by 9.7 per cent since the election of the Coalition in spring . 2010. Mr Pickles said the Government had . ‘worked to freeze council tax for three years, helping hard-working . families and pensioners with their cost of living’. But Matthew Sinclair, of the . TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Rises in council tax are the last thing . families need after the last decade of hikes in a tax that hits those on . low and moderate incomes the hardest. ‘At a time when household budgets are . being squeezed by stagnant wages and rising prices, councils have a duty . to ease the burden they place on residents.’ Hilary Benn, Labour’s Communities . spokesman, said: ‘It is astonishing that Eric Pickles is trying to claim . a success when over two million people on the very lowest incomes will . see their council tax rise next month.’","Bills in England to rise by 0.8% on average but some impose hikes of almost 8% .

The country’s most senior judge yesterday dismissed murder law reforms pushed through by former Labour minister Harriet Harman as useless. Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, said the Harman laws – designed to help women who kill violent boyfriends or husbands – could only very rarely influence the decisions of a judge or jury in a murder trial. As a result, judges had to ‘question their purpose’, he said. Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice (left) said laws pushed through by Harriet Harman (right) could only rarely influence the decisions of a judge or jury in a murder trial . His ruling – delivered in the Appeal Court alongside two other senior judges – effectively wrecks the Labour murder reforms, which were intended to make it harder for men and easier for women to escape a murder conviction. Miss Harman’s reforms, passed by Parliament in 2009, swept away the longstanding ‘crime of passion’ defence of provocation, in which defendants could claim they were driven to murder by the sexual infidelity of their spouse or partner. Labour’s new law said the courts should not consider the effect of infidelity. Instead, it brought in a ‘loss of control’ defence. This could be used by those who feared violence by the person they killed. The law designed to provide a defence for female victims of domestic violence such as Sara Thornton . Miss Harman, who was Minister for Women at the time, said her law would ‘end the culture of excuses’ for male killers. It was designed to provide a defence for female victims of domestic violence such as Sara Thornton, jailed for life in 1990 for murdering with a knife her husband, whom she said was a violent alcoholic. Miss Thornton, who became a feminist heroine, won a retrial and her conviction was reduced to manslaughter six years later. The first part of the Harman law, which was meant to abolish the crime of passion, was overthrown by the Appeal Court last year when judges, including Lord Judge, said that for the courts to ignore infidelity was ‘unrealistic and carries with it the potential for injustice’. Yesterday Lord Judge, sitting with Lady Justice Rafferty and Mr Justice Simon, shot down the second half of Miss Harman’s law. The ruling came as the three Appeal judges considered claims from three killers – all men – that their murder convictions should be overturned because of the new ‘loss of control’ defence. The judges rejected the appeals by Mark Dawes, Mark Hatter and Barry Bowyer. Lord Judge said that the laws introduced by Miss Harman could be considered by the courts only in circumstances ‘much more limited than the equivalent provisions in the former provocation defence’. Otherwise, he said, the loss of control defence would succeed whenever someone accused of murder declared in court that ‘the circumstances caused me to have what I believed was a justifiable sense that I had been seriously wronged’. Lord Judge said: ‘If so, when it is clear that the availability of a defence based on the loss of control has been significantly narrowed, one would have to question the purpose of the law.’","The Lord Chief Justice said the Harman laws could very rarely influence decisions of a judge or jury in a murder trial .

A Liberal Democrat Lord Mayor has kept his job despite making a lewd remark to a schoolgirl. Alan Armitage, 62, was accused of telling the child, ‘It’s sexy when you bend down like that’ while on official duty at an awards evening. It happened while the youngster and other members of an under-13s sport team were having their photograph taken with him. The married father-of-three, who is a city and county councillor, claims he may have said ‘best if you stand next to me’ and was misheard. Oxford Lord Mayor Alan Armitage allegedly made the comment to a member of a under-13s sports team at a awards evening. He is pictured with Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi last June . But a council investigation found it was ‘highly probable’ Mr Armitage, Lord Mayor of Oxford, did make an ‘inappropriate and disrespectful’ comment. At a hearing held in secret to protect the girl’s identity, they ruled he had brought the office of Lord Mayor and the city council into disrepute. But apart from being ‘censured’ – effectively, given a telling off – the council has taken no disciplinary action and he has been allowed to remain Lord Mayor. Yesterday Mr Armitage said: ‘I regret the whole thing very much, but there is no single version of what was said that was endorsed by all the witnesses. ‘I am absolutely sure I did not say ‘‘bending’’ because in the context it is an inappropriate word to use. ‘I think it is very unlikely that I said the word ‘‘sexy’’, and that is what I have said all along, but in any case, I do not believe it [the word] has any sexual connotation. ‘I think it is very unlikely that I would have used the word ‘‘sexy’’ to a 13-year-old girl, but I cannot remember exactly how the repartee went. It was a confused, rowdy event, with a lot of people wanting a photo. ‘I may have said something like ‘‘best if you stand next to me’’ and that could have been misheard as containing the words ‘‘bending’’ and ‘‘sexy’’. However, I don’t believe the girls lied.’ Rap: Oxford City Council's Standards Committee called the alleged comment 'highly inappropriate' The investigation began after a parent complained to the girl’s school about the incident in June last year, a month after Mr Armitage began his year in office as Lord Mayor. The school passed it to Oxfordshire County Council’s child protection team, which found Mr Armitage was not a risk to youngsters. But it did pass its findings to Oxford City Council to see if its code of conduct had been breached. There were differing accounts of what Mr Armitage was alleged to have said. They included: ‘It’s sexy when you bend down like that’; ‘bending is very sexy, isn’t it?’; and ‘ooh, that’s a bit sexy’. It is understood the girl and up to five witnesses gave evidence about the alleged offending comment. Mr Armitage denied the allegation. His wife Jane, a professor of clinical trials and honorary consultant in public health medicine at the University of Oxford, has stood by him. The council’s standards committee met on Wednesday and found he should be censured for breaking the council’s code of conduct. But they also decided ‘there was no reason why Councillor Armitage should not continue to undertake the full range of his mayoral duties and noted that he had given an indication that he would do so’, council documents say. While he has held on to the office of Lord Mayor, Mr Armitage now faces a grilling and disciplinary action from his party. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘Such behaviour is absolutely unacceptable.’ Mr Armitage, who lists his hobbies on a council website as music, history and his allotment, said the investigation had been ‘like a pall’ over his time as Lord Mayor, during which his duties have included presenting Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi with the freedom of the city of Oxford.

I’m very much looking forward to a crowd who have come to see and talk about history.’ A new feature will be an air show featuring Second World War planes like Hurricanes, Mustangs, Messerschmitts and Spitfires (pictured) Explaining the appeal of the festival, . now in its third year and held in an area of outstanding natural beauty . near Salisbury, Wiltshire, fellow author Tom Holland, who will also . appear, said: ‘It’s a  magical world. The setting is absolutely . stunning, like a vision of Wessex. ‘The roster of speakers is amazing – it’s not often you get the chance to see Boris Johnson and Tom Stoppard in the same field as someone dressed up in Dark Ages armour.’ Knight in shining armour: There will be a variety of historical displays and re-enactments . He added: ‘Even if you think you know nothing about history, you do because the raw material of history is what goes into films, novels and television. ‘When you come to the festival you feel you’re going into a slightly different dimension of reality – it has the feel of a Doctor Who episode where they have to time-travel and gather people from different eras.’ The festival, which runs from June 24 to 30, also hosts a history writing prize, in partnership with the Daily Mail and Penguin Books. Mr Iggulden said: ‘The thrill in historical writing is you get the facts and you want to know more. Historical fiction helps you to imagine what it was like to be there.’ A new feature will be an air show featuring Hurricanes, Mustangs, Messerschmitts and Spitfires. Captain Eric ‘Winkle’ Brown, a former Royal Navy officer and test pilot who has flown more types of aircraft than anyone else in history, will also give a talk. Other speakers include the team behind the recent discovery of Richard III’s bones in a Leicester car park. Living history events include ‘Have-a-Go Archery’ and a First World War trench experience.For the first time, there will also be a two-day schools programme, delivered by leading historians, for Year 10 and 12 students.","Chalke Valley History festival has stellar line-up of speakers .

But an exhibition opening today reveals that some of our most common words are in fact not ours at all. The English Effect, staged at the British Council in London, examines how we absorb words from overseas and although English originally developed from Germanic dialects, there are plenty of individual foreign words which have since been added to our vocabulary. Foreign invasion: The word 'zombie' was created by merging the West African words for 'fetish' and 'god' The word booze, for example, has its . origins in the medieval Dutch word busen, which means ‘to drink to . excess’ – and was first used in English by the thieves and beggars of . the 1500s. And despite an urban myth that the . word bungalow was coined when a builder was told to ‘bung a low roof’ on . a house after running out of bricks, it actually originated in the . Bengal region of India. There it was a name for one-storey . homes built for early European immigrants, meaning ‘belonging to . Bengal’. Among other absorbed words are: royal, which came from France . during the middle ages; marmalade, taken in the 1400s from the . Portuguese word marmelo meaning ‘quince’; and shampoo, which derived . from the Hindi word for ‘press or knead’ and came to mean ‘massage’ in . 18th-century English. Meanwhile zombie and vampire – . ever-popular characters in English-speaking films – have their roots in . West Africa and Hungary respectively. Even the word for a favourite English drink, cider, originated from the Middle East. Bloody Mary: We may have named the drink after an English queen, but both tomato and booze are foreign words, the former being an old Aztec word for grow and the latter old Dutch slang for excessive drinking . 1. Dollar (German) 2. Booze (Dutch) 3. Bungalow (Hindi or Bengali) 4. Tomato (Aztec Nahuatl - Mexico) 5. Zombie (West African via the Caribbean) 6. Vampire (Hungarian) 7. Parka (Russian) 8. Shampoo (Hindi) 9. Magazine (Arabic) 10. Avatar (Sanskrit). John Worne, director of strategy at the British Council, said that examining the roots of these words can offer an insight into our history. ‘Many of our most popular and . evocative English words – words we couldn’t live without – came from . other countries and cultures,’ he said. ‘When we look at their roots, we get a fascinating insight into how the language has been influenced throughout its history. ‘English is not just “our” language – . it truly belongs to the whole world, and brings real benefits to anyone . who can speak it. 'Even a few words can bring work, a job or new opportunities.’ Split into three zones the first part of the exhibition examines the value of learning English and the personal benefit it brings to people from around the world. A ‘talking wall’ allows individuals, among them footballers Dider Drogba and Petr Cech, to discuss how the language helps them express themselves and form friendships with their teammates. The second zone addresses the economic value of the language which remains an essential part of entry into many industries. The English teaching industry alone is worth around £2billion to the UK economy. The free exhibition runs until June 29.","Quintessentially English words booze and royalty originated overseas .

A Chinese takeaway worker has told how she is scared she will be 'killed and eaten' after she was linked to an alleged cannibal plot. Lian Chen, who regularly served Dale Bolinger, 57, at the Chop Chop takeaway in Canterbury, Kent, was horrified to learn police were investigating him over an alleged email exchange with a man on trial in the U.S. for cannibal charges. Lian, 27, has said she is too terrified to go out alone after the sinister emails were uncovered. One mentioned a woman apparently matching her description, which said: 'Her name is Lian... I've got so many plans for her! I'll just snap her neck.' Arrested: Dale Bolinger from Canterbury, Kent, was arrested in connection with planning acts of cannibalism with New York police officer Gilberto Valle . 'Terrified': Lian Chen, 27, regularly served Dale Bolinger at the Chop Chop takeaway in Canterbury, Kent . Kent Police swooped on Bolinger after it emerged that the U.S. suspect, New York police officer Gilberto Valle, had been corresponding online with a British contact using the names Moody Blues. Valle - nicknamed the 'Cannibal Cop' - is accused of plotting to kidnap, kill and eat up to 100 women. U.S. court documents contain the details of alleged conversations between the pair. In one e-mail on September 8, Moody Blues described the woman he named as 'Lian', and added 'very cute Chinese accent'. The takeaway worker told the Sun newspaper: 'I'm really terrified. It's evil,' she said. Nurse Bolinger, who has been released on police bail, has said he denied all of the allegations against him. In sick exchanges with Valle, 28, Moody Blues claimed that he had previously eaten a white boy aged five and a black . woman - and in a grotesque British twist advised using the fat from . female breasts to make Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes. The cannibalism enthusiast also had a recipe for 'human haggis' using the lungs and stomach. As he spurred his American associate on, he used the aliases MeatMarket Man and Moody Blues, and even recommended eating a victim alive, saying 'I think of it as eating her to death.' The e-mailer also offered to travel to meet Valle to help him kill and butcher a woman, offering to bring anaesthetic gas and a meat cleaver. By kidnapping and eating a variety of women they could evade capture, unlike the Yorkshire Ripper, he added, saying, 'Girls go missing all the time'. Following up the reports from America, Kent Police arrested two men from Canterbury aged 57 and 30 - one of them male nurse Bolinger - and searched and dug in his garden seeking clues. Police have not released details of the other man arrested, but he is understood have been Bolinger's son Rick, according to a report in the Sun. Two men were detained at the weekend on suspicion of conspiracy offences, grooming and the possession of child abuse images, and are now on police bail. But Bolinger, who separated from wife Rosemary last year, and who shares his home with his son, a would-be performance artist and amateur poet, told reporters he denies all the allegations against him. Arrested: Dale Bolinger, pictured, is one of two men from Canterbury, Kent in the UK who has been arrested in connection to New York's 'Cannibal Cop' case, according to reports .

New York City police officer Gilberto Valle who is charged with plotting to kidnap, rape, torture and cook women alive before eating them . A nurse since 1979, he has been suspended from his nursing job with East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust. Arriving by bicycle back at his rented £100,000 end-of-terrace former council house, Bolinger, who has six cats and three grown-up children, was asked if he denied the allegations against him. Clad in a black woolly skiing hat, a blue fleece, jeans, gloves and white trainers, he said: 'Yes, I do deny them. I don't want to say anything, I have to leave it to the police.' The nurse told The Times: 'None of this is real. It is all fantasy. I have spoken to the police and they are undertaking inquiries.' Meanwhile, Mr Bolinger's next-door neighbour how he saw police searching the 57-year-old suspect's garden sheds and digging in his garden. The neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police turned up last Thursday at about 7am. They were here until about 10pm. There were about seven police vehicles parked outside. 'I could see police going into the back garden. There were two police dogs and they were looking through the two garden sheds. Target? Kathleen Mangan, right, was the subject of horrifying e-mails between Valle and other internet users. He claimed he could lure his wife to India so she could be eaten . An undated photo submitted as evidence shows Gilberto Valle with his daughter. Valle is accused of conspiracy to kidnap a woman and unauthorized use of a law enforcement database that prosecutors say he used to help build a list of potential targets . Sobbing: Kathleen Mangan sobbed in court, shown here in a sketch, as she discussed her husband's plot to abduct, torture and eat dozens of women . 'There was another police person with a shovel. I saw him digging all the soft soil in the flower beds. I think it was soil that looked like it had been dug up recently.' James Godden, 31, who lives near . Bolinger, told KentOnline: 'We saw police here from about 7am last . Thursday and they were all day. 'They had forensics teams and sniffer dogs in the house. We don't know him and have never really seen him.' A police source said: 'Officers examined some areas of the garden that looked like they had been dug up but the police did not carry out a full-scale search of the garden.' New York policeman Valle is being tried on suspicion of conspiracy to kidnap, after being caught by his wife Kathleen Mangan, 27, looking as obscene fetish websites focusing on cannibalism. Among his intended victims was his wife and other acquaintances, one a New York primary school teacher. He is also said to have discussed his plans with a co-defendant from New Jersey, and a butcher in India who said there was an oven to cook Valle's wife in in Pakistan. Valle claims his vile exchanges were all fantasy, but he allegedly used police computers to compile files on more than 100 potential victims - and insisted to his British correspondent 'Moody Blues' that he was serious about his plans. Prosecution case: A passage of a Federal complaint filed in New York against Valle . 'Discovered': Kathleen Mangan, 28, pictured with her husband, was offered up to a Pakistani man to be cooked and eaten . 'Moody Blues', who also called himself Christopher Collins, said: 'I've been let down before, that's why I tend to work alone.' The emailer suggested cutting living victims' feet off and barbecuing them before their eyes. Feet meat was a delicacy, he claimed. When Valle suggested a particular woman as a victim. 'Moody Blues' said he would like her liver 'lightly cooked to keep it sweet and tender'. Valle replied: 'I'm dying to taste some girl meat.' The writer of the emails also suggested using the bones for stock, and added: 'Cut off their t*** and slow roast. That way you'll got lots of girl fat. Great for roasting potatoes and Yorkshire pudding.' The Federal Courthouse in Manhattan where the trial of New York Police Department officer Gilberto Valle, accused of conspiring to kidnap women that he planned to cook and eat, began . Moody Blues also said: 'The meat isn't quite like pork, but very ""meaty"" ... I've eaten a black woman and a white person.' On Facebook Bolinger is pictured with a live snake curled over his shoulder - and among his 'favourites' is the cooking equipment specialist Lakeland, along with a fan page for Olympic heroine Jessica Ennis. On his Friends Reunited website Bolinger fondly remembers his years at the nursing college he graduated from in 1979. Neighbours said Bolinger's son Rick lived with his father - and sometimes the younger man had a girlfriend staying there too. Rick Bolinger has a degree in theatre and performance from the University of Kent in Canterbury, and since graduating has scratched a living as a performance artist with the Accidental Collective - whose members stage bizarre drama 'happenings', and also writes poetry online under the name Rickasaurus Rex. His poems include numerous references to masturbation, and in one he describes himself as 'a punk who likes lattes'. The British suspect separated from his wife Mrs Bolinger, 55, last year, after 32 years of marriage. A director of a company linked to the disability charity Scope, she was 15 years ago diagnosed with cerebral palsy - and has long lobbied for better access for the disabled, even appearing on Radio 4 and in newspapers, as well as pressing Gordon Brown for change when he was premier. Speaking at the former marital home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, she said: 'I don't know anything about the arrest. We are separated. I haven't seen him for over a year. He is my husband in law only.' His daughter Laura-Jane, 26, who is her mother's carer said: 'I knew he had been arrested but not what for.' A spokeswoman for the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation, where Bolinger works, said yesterday: 'A member of staff is suspended pending further police inquiries.' She refused to specify where he worked within the trust. A police spokesman said: 'Kent Police has been in contact with U.S. Law enforcement agencies in relation to this investigation.'

Worse off: A UK family with one worker and two children lost 27.9 per cent of their wages in tax in 2012, compared with the international average of 26.1 per cent, according to an OECD study . Stay-at-home mothers have been hit hardest by new taxes imposed by the coalition, a damning new international study reveals. The British taxman now takes more from single-earner families than most other countries, after launching extra raids on incomes since the 2010 election. The average traditional UK family with one worker and two children lost 27.9 per cent of their wages in tax in 2012, compared with 26.2 per cent in 2009, the year before the Coalition was elected. The international average for such a family is 26.1 per cent, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The situation is even worse for British families with a stay-at-home mother which are classed by the OECD as well-paid – earning more than double the national average. They pay 40.5 per cent of their earnings in tax, compared with an international average of 38.6 per cent. The punishing tax inflicted on traditional families – as a result of a reduction in child benefit and changes to tax credits – contrasts with both single people and two-earner families which have benefited from cuts in the tax-free personal allowances and other changes. According to the OECD both groups pay tax below the international average. The research comes as Nick Clegg faces an angry backlash from stay-at-home mothers over his proposed changes to childcare benefits. The findings will add to fears that the Coalition has developed policies which penalise families with stay-at-home mothers. And it comes amid speculation that the Government is attempting to force women back to work in order to stimulate the economy. Former barrister: Laura Perrins, with her one-year-old son Matthew, ambushed Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg on his weekly radio phone-in show, accusing ministers of viewing her role as ¿worthless¿ . Coalition policies have seen ministers strip high-earning families of child benefit this year, a policy which many claim discriminates against households with a single breadwinner. And a £1billion policy to help families with childcare costs is to be made available only to homes where both parents work. Backlash: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg faces an angry backlash from stay-at-home mothers over his proposed changes to childcare benefits . Last week former barrister Laura Perrins, 32, who stopped work to care for her two children, ambushed Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg on his weekly radio phone-in show, accusing ministers of viewing her role as ‘worthless’. The OECD studied the taxes on wages in its 32 member countries. It studied four groups – single people earning the average wage, a single parent with two children earning two-thirds of the average, a one-earner couple with two children on the average wage, and a two-earner couple with two children. The report compared tax paid in 2012 with figures from 2009 and 2000. In Britain, it found that single parents had seen the biggest fall in tax from 15 per cent of their earnings in 2000 to 8.4 per cent in 2012, mainly because of tax credits. The single person’s tax rate fell from 32.6 per cent to 32.3 per cent over the same period, while the two-earner couple’s tax rate fell from 28.3 per cent to 28 per cent. But while the single-earner couple’s tax rate fell from 27.8 per cent in 2000 to 26.2 per cent in 2009, it rose to 27.9 per cent in 2012.","Family with one worker and two children lost 27.9% of wages in tax in 2012 .

An oil tycoon worth ‘tens of millions’ is establishing a ‘cheats’ charter’ for divorcing husbands by hiding his money in companies, the Supreme Court was told. Businessman Michael Prest, 51, is supposed to be paying ex-wife Yasmin £270,000 a year - but instead is giving her just £150 a week in cash, less than the minimum wage. And although he was previously ordered by the High Court to give her a lump sum of £17.5m and several London houses, he managed to quash that order at the Appeal Court in October by claiming the millions of pounds in cash and properties held by companies he controls should not be counted as his assets. Battle: Michael Prest, left, is 'hiding his millions' from ex-wife Yasmin Prest after being ordered to give her a lump sum of £17.5million . Now, in a divorce case that has built up legal costs estimated to exceed £3m, Mrs Prest, 50, who has four children by her ex-husband, has appealed to London’s Supreme Court to get her hands on the fortune. The ruling could set a precedent for countless other warring couples. Mrs Prest is understood to still live in the £4m marital home in exclusive Bayswater, west London. Technically, her court battle is against three Isle of Man-registered companies under her husband’s control: Petrodel Resources, Petrodel Upstream, and Vermont Petroleum. Her barrister Richard Todd QC told the court yesterday: ‘It is not hyperbole to say that this is a case where, if the companies succeed, this wife will be rendered destitute. ‘They say it is not the case that this is a “cheats’ charter”, even though it would result in Mr Prest and his companies coming away with tens of millions of pounds, while the wife is reduced to claiming benefits. ‘They say it is not a cheats’ charter because there are potentially other remedies available to the wife. We say that is not so.’ Mr Todd said although Mr Prest claimed she could simply be given shares in the companies, their whole management was so much in his hands, and he had already woven such a ‘web of deceit in respect of ownership of these shares that it would be impossible to ever work out what the position is’. Seeking any such agreement with Mr Prest, said Mr Todd, ‘is going to result in her being led a merry dance without any reward’. The barrister went on: ‘The husband, who is resident in Monaco, simply uses these companies as his piggy bank. ‘He is supposed to be paying Mrs Prest £270,000 per annum, but he simply chooses not to pay that. ‘The true position is that he is paying Mrs Prest £150 cash per week - £7,800 per annum - a little bit less than the minimum wage.’ Lawyers acting for Mrs Prest at the Supreme Court in London said her ex-husband could leave her 'destitute' Mr Todd said the businessman had also ignored orders to pay massive legal costs, although his companies were financing the four children through ‘the finest public schools with a bill exceeding £100,000 per annum’. He said the wife had managed to identify two properties owned by the companies which arguably could be sold and the money given to her - but Mr Prest claimed they were in negative equity. Mr Todd went on to say that if Mr Prest and his companies won the Supreme Court case, other husbands would similarly be able to dishonestly hide their assets from their wives in companies, behind a ‘corporate veil’. If the case went Mr Prest’s way, he said, the Matrimonial Causes Act, put into law to give divorcing spouses a fair share of their assets, would be rendered useless. He said: ‘Mr Prest has exhibited a strong desire to thwart the intentions of the court. ‘It is effectively the companies’ case that we would have a cheats’ charter. ‘It would be a simple matter to incorporate a company, or better still use a company already incorporated, in order to retain assets and make them judgement-proof in a case such as this.’ ‘This would be that very cheats’ charter, it would reduce the Matrimonial Causes Act to being nothing more than a scarecrow.’ Mr Todd added that the court should ‘pierce the corporate veil’ Mr Prest was hiding his fortune behind and simply treat the companies’ assets as his. In previous hearings in the lengthy divorce campaign, Nigerian Mr Prest had been criticised by a judge who told him he was treating the case ‘as a game’ by claiming to be £48m in debt when his Petrodel companies had a turnover of almost £2.5bn a year. The High Court estimated his wealth to be at least £37.5m when it ordered him to give almost half that to Mrs Prest. But he then referred to ‘native’ African law in his successful appeal, claiming that under customary Nigerian law he was head of his extended family, and held his company assets in trust for them. He met his England-born and Isle of Man-raised wife in London and they married in 1993. He was named one of the most influential black men in Britain in 2007. Mrs Prest originally sought a payout of more than £30m and said she and the children needed £730,000 a year to cover their ‘reasonable needs’. The case continues.

The mother of a three-year-old girl killed when a gust wind blew her buggy into the road is still too distressed to talk to police, an inquest heard today. It was also revealed that the driver of a delivery van that hit Olivia Langley in Croydon, South London, was reversing at the time. Louise Uffindell left her daughter in her pushchair outside her front door for a matter of seconds to get something from inside and when she returned her daughter was on the road. Despite her desperate efforts, nursery nurse Ms Uffindell was unable to revive her daughter. Scroll down for neighbours' reaction to girl's death . Olivia, pictured with mother Louise Uffindell, died when her buggy was apparently blown in front of a van . Olivia's grandmother Debbie McClatchie said: 'She was very chatty very funny, very clever. She was such a lovely girl . I don't know how we're going to live without her' Detective Sergeant Matt Austin, from . the road death investigations unit at Catford, told the inquest the . driver was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by . careless driving. He said: 'The driver has given us an . account saying he is very familiar with the area and very familiar with . that particular block as he makes deliveries there quite regularly. 'He says he was driving slowly partly . due to the fact the road is so poorly maintained. When he has his goods . on board he doesn't want to damage them. 'He was in the process of reversing . the vehicle when he felt some sort of bump or touch. He immediately . stopped to get out of his driver's seat. 'That is when Olivia's mother has picked her up from the roadside and taken her straight into the hallway of the property.' The court heard how Olivia's mother turned her back on the child for just a few seconds when the tragedy occurred. DS Austin said: 'Olivia was in the buggy she was placed in the buggy by her mother outside her home address. 'We haven't been able to take a formal . account from the mother because she is in too much distress, this is . what we have been told by the grandmother. 'Olivia was put into the buggy, Louise . turned around to get something from her kitchen work top and as she has . turned back around again to go out, the buggy has been blown by the . wind into the road and she (Olivia) has then come into contact with a . white Mercedes delivery van that was delivering parcels to an adjoining . block.' Olivia's mother was said to have let go of her pushchair for less than a second as she reached back inside her front door .

The inquest heard how a post mortem found that the three year-old died from a severe head injury. But a second post mortem is set to be carried out after being requested by the drivers' solicitors. Coroner Dr Roy Palmer asked for it to . be carried out speedily so that the toddler's body can be released to . her family to allow her funeral to be conducted.

"One in four people in Japan now suffer from hay fever every year . By . Amanda Williams . PUBLISHED: . 12:07 EST, 26 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:35 EST, 27 March 2013 . Japanese scientists say they have developed the first pollen and allergy-free cedar tree (stock image) As Britain gets set to wind the clocks forward and prepares to welcome in the signs of summer, Japanese experts may have engineered a solution to one of its most dreaded problems - hay fever. Scientists at the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute announced they have successfully developed the first pollen and allergy-free cedar tree. They say by using a process called genetic recombination, which alters the DNA makeup of the plant, they were able to create region-specific trees that do not produce pollen. Katsuaki Ishii, who led the research, said although American scientists have already created pollenless pine trees, it has never been achieved before with cedars. The completely pollen-free trees are still in the experimental stage, but low-pollen trees have already been planted across Japan - which has recorded worsening hay fever figures in recent years, Abc News reports. The number of Japanese who suffer from hay fever has tripled in the last 30 years. One in four people in Japan now suffer from hay fever every year, and pollen counts have already been especially high this year – five times higher than last spring. Researchers have attributed this to a sudden spike in temperatures, a hot summer last year, and also a large amount of the cedar trees - known as 'Sugi'. They say by using a process called genetic recombination, which alters the DNA makeup of the plant, they were able to create region-specific trees that do not produce pollen . An allergy causes the body’s immune . system to see a harmless substance, as harmful, and produce antibodies . called IgE (immunoglobulin E) to fight it. This results in the release of . histamine, which produces a range of conditions including itching and . rashes, swelling, gut symptoms such as vomiting, stomach ache and . diarrhoea, and respiratory symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, asthma, . blocked or runny nose. Severe cases can be life threatening — this is known as anaphylactic shock. The lips, tongue or face can swell up . or the throat may constrict, causing breathing difficulties that need . urgent medical attention. A mass of the trees were planted after World War II, in a bid to aid the post-war construction boom. Since then, demand for the wood has dropped off, and the trees have matured and so now emit more pollen. Japanese retailers have been reaping the benefits of the soaring pollen count however, with a host of products, including surgical masks, anti-pollen glasses, nose plugs, nasal sprays, and portable air purifiers small enough to be worn around the neck. Currently up to one in eight people in Britain experience moderate or severe hayfever symptoms. Pollen counts are usually high between the start of June and the middle of July. Pollen is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle, and contains proteins that can cause the nose, eyes, throat and sinuses to become swollen, irritated and inflamed. There is currently no cure for hay fever but most people are able to relieve symptoms with treatment, at least to a certain extent. An agricultural research group is creating a hypoallergenic apple by substituting natural proteins for those which don't cause an allergic reaction. Apples are not usually associated with allergies. However, 75 per cent of people suffering from an allergy to birch pollen are also allergic to apples. Those sensitive to the fruit can still experience unpleasant irritation and blistering of the tongue and lips.","Japanese experts used process called genetic recombination to create tree .

A crowd of many thousands, made up of Islamists and liberals, highlighted the anger some feel towards the ruling military who they blame for the country's political chaos. A giant banner unveiled at the demonstration read: 'rejection of military rule.' Protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square saw the unfurling of a 'rejection of miilitary rule' banner . Pressure is piling up on the military leaders of Egypt after thousands chanted slogans and demanded the hand-over of power in Tahrir Square . Friday's huge demonstration came on the eve of the country's first presidential elections since Hosni Mubarak was ousted more than a year ago. 'Down with military rule,' protesters . in Tahrir chanted. Giant banners draped around the plaza . denounced candidates seen as 'feloul,' or 'remnants' of the Mubarak era. Liberals and youth . groups called for all factions to agree on an anti-military 'revolution' candidate in the presidential vote. The Muslim .

Zookeepers have finally been able to get close enough to a protective mother gorilla to determine the sex of her baby . And after two months Twycross Zoo, Warwickshire, are finally able to announce it is a bouncing baby boy . Ozala, gave birth to the critically endangered western lowland gorilla, on January 3 2013, at 9.15am following a short and stress-free labour . Yet, while initially some were lucky to catch a glimpse of the newborn, Ozala is now a very confident and relaxed mother, enabling staff to properly inspect the infant. Now, the only thing left to do is to decide on a name for the baby. The zoo is part of a successful primate breeding programme. The youngster, is the fourth offspring born to the 18-year-old female. At the time of the birth, Neil Dorman, curator of conservation programmes and planning at the zoo, said: 'Gorillas are very protective creatures, for the first few weeks, even months, the baby with stay very close to mum, she will carry it all the time. 'Even when it starts to become more independent, she won't let it venture very far from her. 'Because she is holding it so close it is very difficult to tell the sex, early indications are it is a boy, but we can't be certain. 'She's being very attentive towards it, cleaning it, feeding it, all the signs are good at this stage.' Gorillas have been at Twycross Zoo, which is part of the European breeding programme for critically endangered primates, since the 1960s and they have been successfully breeding the animals since 1985. After the baby gorilla was born, staff at the zoo soon found were unable to get close enough to 16-stone Ozala to take a look at him . In 2009 a new 20-year-old male, a dominant silverback named Oumbie, was introduced to Twycross' gorilla 'troop,' which also includes Ozala's mother, Biddy, 38, and her half-sister, Asante, 27. By that time Ozala had already had two babies - her first born, Matadi, arrived in March 2003 and is now cared for at Paignton Zoo, Devon. Unfortunately, her second baby, a female named Ndoki, who was born in May 2007, died aged just three months. However, following the arrival of Oumbie, Ozala fell pregnant again and a male Okanda was born last April. Although Okanda suffered some problems around six months old, when the zoo's vet Sarah Chapman was forced to care for him at home for a spell because he wasn't getting enough nutrients from his mother, he survived and is currently living at Stuttgart Zoo, Germany. Oumbie is also the father of the new baby . A 60 per cent decline in numbers in the last 25 years has moved the central African ape's status from 'endangered' to 'critically endangered'. Forest clearance, which has allowed hunters into previously inaccessible areas, combined with the deadly Ebola virus, has been blamed for wiping out a third of all western lowland gorillas in protected areas in just 15 years.","Twycross Zoo, Warwickshire, is finally able to .

They say the camera never lies – and even in this early picture you can see she oozes star quality. This remarkable photograph captures Karen Gillan’s first appearance in front of a television camera – courtesy of Girls Aloud star Nicola Roberts. The girl band superstar spotted Miss Gillan’s talent long before Doctor Who producers, and headhunted the Scot from the catwalk to star in a TV show. Beauty: Karen Gillan in the ITV programme The Passions of Girls Aloud. Singer Nicola Roberts was ahead of the curve when she saw the talent in the actress . More importantly perhaps, the Inverness-born beauty – who was then a struggling student – actually got paid for her work. The still, from documentary The Passions of Girls Aloud, was taken more than five years ago, shortly after Miss Gillan was seduced by the bright lights of London and moved south from her family home. She had won a place at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts drama school on the BA (Hons) degree course, and like most  cash-strapped students, the star in the making needed to earn some money to survive. With her striking looks, it was hardly surprising that Miss Gillan was soon scouted by a top London modelling agency and booked for assignments including appearances at London Fashion Week. Leading designer Allegra Hicks was enthralled by Miss Gillan’s slender figure, long legs and stunning looks and used her prominently throughout her autumn/winter collection. During one fashion show, Miss Gillan captured the eye of another stylish redhead, Nicola Roberts. The pair boast remarkably similar features and delicate colouring. Porcelain: Nicola Roberts thought Karen Gillan was prefect to help her market Dainty Doll, a make-up line for paler women . At the time the singer had already achieved incredible success as a member of the all-female group Girls Aloud. After 20 consecutive Top Ten singles, five albums and positive critical acclaim from an army of young teenagers, Miss Roberts was keen to put her entrepreneurial skills to the test. She also wanted to combat the snide remarks made about her pale skin which she had endured during her early days in the spotlight. The taunts she suffered left Miss Roberts severely depressed and on the verge of quitting her successful pop career to disappear into the background. But Miss Roberts recognised that many other young women faced similar problems and decided to help by establishing a cosmetics collection. The result was Dainty Doll, a make-up line created especially for girls with fair skin, and she chose Miss Gillan as one of the models for the brand. The business venture would eventually lead the two redheads to develop a special bond – and provide a vital career break for the Scot. Early days: Karen Gillan, top, in TV show with Nicola Roberts, centre . The pop star invited Miss Gillan to appear in an episode of  ITV2 television documentary series The Passions of Girls Aloud, which charts her struggle to create her beauty range. Since then, the pair have remained good friends as they have gone from strength to strength  professionally, with the unknown student becoming as much a household name as her mentor. While the Girls Aloud star has returned to the fore to perform a series of sell-out concerts, Miss Gillan took on a starring role as a Doctor Who companion. Now that her character Amy Pond has departed the sci-fi series in a blaze of glory, the 25-year-old is ready to seek international fame and fortune in Hollywood. Although home in Scotland over the festive season, the actress will soon be heading back to Los Angeles and what promises to be a hugely exciting period in her life and film career. Miss Gillan said: ‘I have a few things in the offing but I don’t want to give too much away at this stage. 'Hopefully things will work out really well for me, although it is still strange getting used to all that sunshine in LA.’","Doctor Who star spotted by singer in fashion show .

These photos, taken in remote villages in rural Albania, appear to be portraits of elderly and middle-aged men. But the subjects are in fact women, women known as 'sworn virgins', females who have chosen - in the absence of any suitable male heir within their family - to renounce their femininity, cut off their hair and live in celibacy as 'honorary' men for the rest of their lives. Antonia Young, anthropologist and author of Women Who Become Men: Albanian Sworn Virgins, explains that the rigid patriarchy of remote Albania refuses to allow a woman to take over the family estate once all men have died. 'Sworn virgins' came about when there was no man left to inherit a family's land in rural, patriarchal Albania, and a woman was forced to take over by abandoning her womanhood and becoming a celibate male figure . And so when only women remain within a family, one will decide to become a 'man', swearing to remain an unmarried virgin forever and become the new head of the family. Or else, as is the case when girls are very young, her parents will decide for her. Young explains that the sworn-in girl will be brought up and dressed as a boy, forced to act as a male and to socialise with other boys and men, shall organise the farmland and the work done on it, and even be permitted to carry a weapon. The 'sworn virgin' will never be allowed to revert back to being a woman. It is thought that breaking the vow was once punishable by death. Sworn virgins, right, are required to dress and act as men, and be completely celibate - it is thought that breaking the vow was once punishable by death . She adds that the ancient custom, now dying out, has lasted for some 200 years. It remained a strong tradition in Albania - and to a lesser extent in Montenegro and Kosovo - until the fall of communism in 1991, but sworn virgins are now a rarity. The practice was born from traditional, northern Albanian law, . the Kanun of Lek Dukagjin, which believed that women belonged to their fathers . until marriage, and then became the property of their husbands. Becoming a 'sworn virgin' did allow women to escape from unwanted arranged marriages. Speaking about the custom, Young says it not only gave women independence, 'but also a right to head a family, and retain . property which otherwise would be taken over by the closest male . relative'. In rural Albania the practice of 'sworn virgins', left, is the social norm, according to anthropologist Antonia Young, right . The public declaration in which the female becomes a man happens on one of three occasions: At her birth (if the family has no male heir and knows they never will), at the death of the family's only male (often at war), . or at her refusal to marry the man her family wish her to accept as a husband. Interestingly, most 'sworn virgins' confess to feeling proud of their fate, and say they gained status they would not otherwise have had in such a patriarchal society. In rural Albania, the practice is still accepted as a social norm. Young says: 'It is so accepted as normal that people could not understand why I found it so interesting.'","Remote mountain villages allow women to become 'honorary' men .

Warrior: The bones of a medieval knight have been discovered under an old city car park in Edinburgh . In life, he would have been among the social elite, a man of honour and privilege befitting his warrior status. But, in death, it seems the Scottish knight was destined to suffer the same indignity as King Richard III – being buried on a site that was to be later covered by a car park. Only months after the king’s 500-year-old corpse was found in Leicestershire, the grave of a medieval knight has been uncovered in Edinburgh. The body was found near the foundations of a 13th century monastery yesterday, on the construction site of a state-of-the-art university research building. Workers were taken aback when they came across a sandstone slab decorated with elaborate carvings of a cross and a sword. They called in archaeologists, who found a man's skeleton beneath the stone. The inscription on the gravestone signifies the skeleton is that of a knight. The knight's skeleton and teeth are in good condition and have been removed by forensic experts, who will examine them in an attempt to find out as much as they can about his life and death. The site where the knight was found was once a 13th-century Blackfriars Monastery founded by King Alexander II of Scotland, but was destroyed during the Protestant Reformation in 1558. Archaelologists say the knight would have paid a toll to the local monastery over the course of his life to make sure he was buried in religious grounds. Discovery: Archaeologist Ross Murray at the grave which was discovered near the remaining foundations of a monastery built during the reign of King Alexander II of Scotland . Archaeologists discovered the skeleton with many other artifacts when excavating a building site in Edinburgh's Old Town . This is not the first time that . archaeologists have excavated in the area; the sites of the 18th- . century Old High School and the 16th-century Royal High School were . found only yards from the knight’s grave. Astonished by his unexpected discovery, Ross Murray of Headland Archaeology, who studied at a University of Edinburgh building yards from where the knight was buried, said: ‘We obviously knew the history of the High School Yards site while we were studying here, but I never imagined I would be back here to make such an incredible discovery. ‘We used to take breaks between classes just a few feet away from the building’s doorway – and all the time the grave was lying under the car park.’ The skeleton was found in good condition in grave covered by a stone marked with an inscription of a sword . 1214: King Alexander II takes the throne of Scotland. 1215: A Scottish army joined English barons in battle against John of England. 1221: King Alexander married Joan of England which strengthened diplomacy. 1234: Independence in Galloway ends after the death of Lord Alan. The King's forces crush rebels there in 1235. 1237: Treaty of York is signed by Scotland and England. 1249: King Alexander II dies of a fever on Isle of Kerrera and is succeeded by his son Alexander III. 1263: The Scots defeat the Norwegians in the Battle of Largs . 1292: King Edward I of England interferes in Scottish affairs and appoints John of Balliol King of Scotland . 1296 - 1328: First War of Scottish Independence is fought and won by Scotland. The car park in the Old Town was being demolished to make way for the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation (ECCI). The innovative green building has been designed to be highly efficient and sustainable – and is even fitted with a tank which harvests rainwater. But the building of the future will have to wait as historians go back in time on the site. ECCI director Andy Kerr said: ‘We always knew that the building retrofit might uncover historical artefacts, given the site’s history – but this knight is an extraordinary and exciting find. ‘We want our new building to play a key role in shaping Scotland’s future, as these historical buildings on this site did in their time.’ Richard Lewis, culture convener for the City of Edinburgh Council said: 'This find has the potential to be one of the most significant and exciting archaeological discoveries in the city for many years, providing us with yet more clues as to what life was like in medieval Edinburgh '. After King Richard III’s remains were found in a car park in 2012 Leicester cathedral yesterday revealed there will be no grand tomb when his remains are reinterred later this year.

According to Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, . the reverse is also true. In fact, she says the 'secret' of her success . was marrying a man 20 years older than her. Burns's husband Lloyd Bean also worked for Xerox as a scientist and researcher, but she was the real star. The engineering . hotshot started as a summer intern at Xerox and rose rapidly through . the ranks to become the first African-American female CEO. Behind every great woman... Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, who was named Forbes' 14th most powerful woman in the world in 2009, says she owes her success to her older husband . In 2009, . Forbes magazine called her the 14th most powerful woman in the world, . and she's credited with helping bring the company back from the dead. But it . seems that Burns, who was known for challenging conventional wisdom at . work, wasn't afraid to do the same in her personal life. She saw her . husband's age as an advantage instead of an obstacle because, according . to The Wall Street Journal, he 'had already gone through this 'growing . up' stuff. Often, stories . about massive age gaps feature pictures of Ronnie Wood or Hugh Hefner . holding hands with women young enough to be their daughters. But Burns . isn't the only ambitious women to discover out that an older man's . assets go way beyond the size of his wallet. Older men are biologically wired to be more nurturing. As someone raised by a single mom in a Lower East Side housing project, this was undoubtedly an important quality to Burns. Her mother ironed shirts and ran a day care center - making only $4,400 in her best year - to raise the funds to send her girls to a private Catholic school. Power couple: Catherine Townsend, pictured with her husband Peter Katsis on their wedding day, agrees that older men are more supportive to an ambitious woman . When Burns began studying engineering at Columbia University, her goal was to eventually support her mother. As her career and travel schedule became more demanding, her husband was able to retire and help raise their children (Burns has a daughter and a stepson). Older men are also more emotionally bonded to their partners because testosterone begins to decrease after 40, while levels of the 'cuddle' chemical oxytocin stays steady. This is why the ruthless CEO who was out the door at 35 wants to spoon after sex once he hits 50. It's also why first families get so annoyed when the man who was MIA becomes a doting husband and father the second time around. I'm not in the same league as Burns when it comes to my career, but I did marry a man 20 years older than me. As a writer who climbed the ranks from intern to newspaper columnist and later author, having a supportive partner has been crucial to my continued success. It wasn't always this way: In the past, my love life and career success seemed to be inversely proportional. I was attracted to successful, charismatic, ambitious men whom I considered my peers and went through dozens of 'Mr. Bigs'. But the ones I would consider setting up home with often didn't consider me wife material. The men I dated either became competitive professionally or expected me to have a more traditional, stay-at-home role.One ex, a banker, offered to pay me the yearly equivalent of my biggest-ever salary if I relocated with him to Hong Kong to be there for him when he got home from work. 'Don't worry darling,' he said, 'you can still do your writing as a hobby.' Sadly, the assumption that my career should take a backseat to theirs wasn't uncommon. 'I was rooting for her. There's no way you could try to hold somebody like that back' Lloyd Bean, husband of Ursula Burns . Everything changed when I met Peter, a handsome and successful music manager 20 years older than me. At first, the age difference seemed . like the least obvious red flag. He had never been married, had a . reputation for partying like the rock stars he managed, and brought . several scantily-clad twenty-somethings to our first dinner date. But . after being hyper-focused on work and his next conquest throughout his . thirties and forties, he was now ready to ditch the entourage and focus . all of his attention on me. His age was a plus because, like . Burns's husband, he was ready to grow up. So I married him, and now I . have the best of both worlds: a man who is successful enough to . understand my ambition, while at the same time happy to let me have the . spotlight. Super women: Both Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman (left) and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (right) have openly spoken of how their husbands' support has been crucial to their careers . Other high-profile females have spoken out about the importance of choosing the right partner. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has openly praised her husband's willingness to split childcare and housework. And for some power couples like Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, whose neurosurgeon husband Griffith Harsh IV moved from Harvard to California when she became CEO of eBay, the secret seems to be prioritizing and compromise. So for ambitious women, it seems that the most important factor isn't a partner's age. It's his attitude. 'I was rooting for her,' Bean told CNN when asked how he felt about his wife's career eclipsing his own. 'There's no way you could try to hold somebody like that back.' Most successful people have learned the importance of picking the right person on the job. But since relationships can build us up or tear us down every day, the most important member of the team is the one waiting for us at home.","Ursula Burns, 54, is the first female African-American CEO and was named 14th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes in 2009 .

After his last resting place beneath a council car park, anything would be an improvement for Richard III. But following one row over whether his remains should be reburied in Leicester or York, a new dispute emerged yesterday over how grand the tomb should be. Despite calls for an elaborate memorial, it seems the last Plantagenet king will have to make do with something much more simple within Leicester Cathedral. The cathedral’s design brief specifies a preference for ‘a place of simple dignity’ – an engraved memorial stone. It informs architects the church authorities would like to ‘mark the place of burial with a ledger stone’ which sits flat on the floor, possibly with a ‘decorative border’. Anything more grandiose would be ‘disproportionate’. The new monument will be placed on the spot where a memorial stone commemorating the 15th century king currently sits within the chancel. ‘While the remains of an English king are of historical significance, it should not be forgotten that Richard demonstrated both the honourable and dishonourable characteristics of human beings,’ the brief states. ‘Opportunities for prayer and reflection should focus on themes of sin and redemption, justice and peace.’ The proposal was greeted with dismay by Philippa Langley of the Richard III Society, who led the campaign to search for the king’s remains which were unearthed last year under the car park near Leicester Cathedral. She . had commissioned a raised limestone tomb embellished with Richard’s . symbols and said she was ‘shocked and disappointed’ by the design brief.

The robot is able to speak, move and interact using a series on sensors - and can even tell where Aiden is looking that's to  a specially developed cap. Scroll down for video . Aiden, three and a half, with Nao, his robotic 'buddy' that is programmed to help him deal with some of the social problems associated with autism . Nao the autism robot can help children become more adept in social situations by running through behavioural exercises with them . A team of mechanical engineers and autism experts . at Vanderbilt University have developed the system and used it to . demonstrate that robotic systems may be powerful tools for enhancing the . basic social learning skills of children with ASD. Writing in the March issue of the IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems . and Rehabilitation Engineering, the researchers report that children . with ASD paid more attention to the robot and followed its instructions . almost as well as they did those of a human therapist in standard . exercises used to develop joint attention skill. 'This is the first real world test of whether intelligent adaptive . systems can make an impact on autism,' said Zachary Warren, . who directs the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum . Disorders (TRIAD) at Vanderbilt’s Kennedy Center. The researchers built an 'intelligent environment' around NAO, a . commercial humanoid robot made in France, whose control architecture was . augmented for the purpose. The . setup allowed the researchers to test the relative effectiveness of the . robot-based system and human therapists in joint attention training . with a dozen 2- to 5-year-old children, six with ASD and a control group . of six typically developing children. They alternated short human-led . and robot-led training sessions and compared how the children performed. Nao the robot being used in tests with autistic children . The small robot stands on a table at the front of the room, and flat panel displays are attached to the side walls. The chair where the child sits faces the front of the room and is . high enough to put the robot at eye level. The room is equipped with a . number of inexpensive web cameras that are aimed at the chair. Their purpose is to track the child’s head movements, so the system can determine where he or she is looking. To aid in this effort, children in the study wore a baseball cap . decorated with a strip of LED lights that allowed the computer to infer . where they are looking. The robot has been programmed with a . series of verbal prompts, such as “look over here” and “let’s do some . more,” and gestures such as looking and pointing at one of the displays, . that imitate the prompts and gestures that human therapists use in . joint attention training. The trials begin with a verbal prompt that asks the child to look at an image or video displayed on one of the screens. If the child doesn’t respond, then the therapist provides increasing . support by combining a verbal prompt with physical gestures such as . turning her head or pointing. When the child looks at the target then . the therapist responds with praise, such as telling the child, 'good . job.' Researchers found that the children in both groups spent more time . looking at the robot than they spent looking at the human therapist.

Sarah Tipping and George, 13, who was kidnapped when he was six months old and not reunited with his mother for 12 hours . The mother of a teenager who was kidnapped as a baby has confessed the ordeal left her so fiercely protective of her son that she now stalks him to make sure he is safe. Sarah Tipping, 34, from Brighton, East Sussex, admits she follows 13-year-old George every time he leaves the house because she is still traumatised by him being snatched when he was six months old. Baby George was snatched in his pram from outside a cafe in 1999, leaving his distraught mother Sarah not knowing if he was dead or alive. Although he was found safe and well several hours later and his kidnapper was jailed, Sarah’s agony had just begun. Sarah said: 'I'm ashamed to admit what I do but the truth is, the terror of that day haunts me even now. 'Everyone . thinks that when a kidnapped child is found, the story is over. But . when my son was snatched, our lives changed forever and it was the start . of the nightmare. Now my biggest fear is I will lose him all over . again.' While George was a toddler at home it was easy to keep him under watch - and when he started nursery, she went with him. When he moved up to primary school, she made sure she was always the first parent outside the gates at pick-up time. Sarah also insisted on going on all . school trips and staying at children’s parties to watch over him. When . George was six, she started having counselling to deal with her anxiety . but it did little to help. By the age of ten, George started . complaining about not being allowed to do anything on his own - so she . began bribing with money and computer games to get him to stay indoors . under her watchful eye. Sarah, pictured with George when he was a baby, says her biggest fear is that she will lose him all over again . Sarah says: 'I tried to explain what had happened to him, but he was too young to understand really. 'So instead, I resorted to bribing him with cash to stay home. Like most boys his age, he soon realised he could work it to his advantage.' When George turned 12, his friends started going out on their bikes, and Sarah knew his social life would suffer unless she loosened her grip. That was when she started letting him out - but following him in secret. Sarah said she tried bribing George with cash to stay at home because she was scared what would happen if he left the house . She said: 'I never thought I could run that fast until I followed George on his bike. But believe me, if you're worried about your child, you have speed you never thought you had. 'I was very careful not to be seen, even if it meant hiding behind a wall. I wish I could stop but I am still terrified something will happen to him.' Sarah said: 'Everyone thinks that when a kidnapped child is found, the story is over - but when my son was snatched, our lives changed forever and it was the start of the nightmare' Sarah was single and 21 when she gave birth to George, having split up with his father with his dad when she was five months' pregnant. Keen to support her son, she worked at a local shoe shop in Brighton while her parents looked after George. But on October 12, 1999, the happy new mum's life was turned upside down when her dad James burst through the door of her shop without her beloved baby. George as a young boy . Sarah says: 'I looked at him and the first thing I said was, ""Where’s George?"" 'Dad looked pale and there was no buggy so I knew something was terribly wrong even before he spoke.' Her father managed to say through tears: 'I’ve lost him.' Sarah said: 'I felt like my heart stopped.' James explained that he had taken George out for a walk in his buggy when he'd been approached by a new neighbour, an 18-year-old girl who had moved in four months earlier. She had tearfully explained that she was having trouble getting her wages from a local café. She asked James if he would go back with her for support. Feeling sorry for the girl, he had agreed. But when they got to the café, the teenager offered to stand outside with George while James went to speak to the owner, who had no idea who he was talking about. When James came out, he discovered the girl - and his grandson - had vanished. He immediately went to find Sarah at work and a huge police hunt began, complete with helicopter search teams. Sarah had never met the woman who stole her baby so tried not the think the worst. She said: 'I tried to stay positive but at the end of the day, I didn't know what she wanted my son for. 'Dad just sobbed on the sofa while I paced the floor unable to sit down.' It was six agonising hours before they finally got news. Baby George with Sarah's father, James, who was looking after George when he was kidnapped by a teenage woman from outside a cafe . Police announced that they had found George and his abductor in Alton, Hants, 50 miles away. They had received a tip-off from someone who knew the girl, who was claiming George was her own. They had become suspicious and called the police. The girl was arrested and George was taken to a local police station. Sarah and her father went straight there when they were told. Sarah says: 'George was actually smiling when he saw us. His cheeky little face gave no clue to what he had been through.' George in an early school photo . In May 2000, George’s kidnapper was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court to 18 months at a young offender’s institute. She claimed to have taken George because she had suffered a miscarriage and had been too afraid to tell her boyfriend. After snatching George, she had boarded a train to her boyfriend's mum's house and pretended George was hers. The judge called her 'a very devious and dishonest young woman'. Sarah says: 'I almost fainted with the relief when she was sentenced.' But the young mum's joy was short-lived as she found she was unable to let George out of her sight - and even gave up her job to devote herself to his safety. Sarah says: 'I’d forgiven my dad but I couldn’t risk losing my son ever again. 'My dad turned to drink to cope with the guilt of what he had put us through. I told him I didn’t blame him but it wasn’t enough - a year later he died of a heart attack, aged 42. 'I blamed the stress of the kidnapping. It was devastating and made my urge to protect George even more overwhelming.' Sarah snubbed strangers who stopped to coo over her baby and avoided all kinds of social situations. And even all these years later, she still cannot overcome the terror and kick the habit of guarding her boy - although she does worry that she will end up driving him away. She says: 'Even George tells me not to be daft - after all, he's almost taller than me - but nobody knows the fear of kidnap until they have experienced it. 'I want the best for my son and worry that I’ll lose him all over again because of my over-protectiveness.' 'George will now know what I am doing but I have to tell my story. I know I need to get help before I push him away. 'I wish that when he was found it was the end of the story, but it was just the beginning. But I’m determined to control this for the sake of my son. 'I want people to understand how devastating and traumatic kidnapping can be, even when a child is found.' All these years later, Sarah still can't get over the fear of George being taken away from her all over again, so she stalks him to ensure he is safe .","Sarah Tipping, 34, from Brighton, East Sussex, admits following George, 13 .

It's been just a few weeks since Jeff Bush died after being swallowed by a sinkhole in Seffner, Florida but the scares for the town continue. Another sinkhole emerged Saturday evening at the 1400 block of Lake Shore Drive between two houses. According to WFLA estimates have this sinkhole measuring approximately 8 feet in width. Another sinkhole appears in Seffner, Florida just a few weeks after Jeff Bush was killed after a sinkhole swallowed him while he was sleeping at his home . Both of the homes on either side of the sinkhole have been evacuated. This is now the third sinkhole to emerge in the Florida town this month after a sinkhole appeared just days after the one that killed Bush. Jeff Bush was presumed dead after he was sucked into . the 30-foot-wide, 60-foot-deep hole late on March 3rd at his home in Seffner, Florida. Three days after that workers began filling the sinkhole with crushed rocks, after authorities conceded they may never find his body. These images, which reveal the size of the hole for the first time, came as a second sinkhole appeared just streets away. This sinkhole, which is 12-feet round, three-feet deep around the edge and five-feet deep in the center, opened beneath a fence on Monday, straddling two properties. Scroll down for video . First look inside: An aerial view shows the sinkhole in Seffner, Florida which opened up last Thursday and swallowed Jeff Bush from his bedroom . Revealed: The sinkhole could only be seen once the home was pulled down on Monday. But authorities believe it could reach to the neighbours' homes underground . End of the search: Officials have given up hope of finding Jeff Bush alive and filled in the hole beneath his family's home with crushed rock . Secured: The sinkhole in Seffner, Florida has now been filled with crushed rocks as authorities admitted they may never find Mr Bush's body . It does not pose an immediate danger, Hillsborough County spokesman Willie Puz said, and it did not cause any injuries or structural damage to the homes around it but buckled the fence. Families in the neighborhood said they . were leaving to stay at hotels and Laurie Goldstein, who lives across . the street from the sinkhole, said she will have her home inspected for . other sinkholes. 'Is it too close for comfort having it across the street? Yeah. Is my house gonna sink? Yeah it's very, it's scary,' she told WFLA. But others were less worried: Ana Marie Serna, who owns one of the properties, said she was not concerned about the hole. Fears: Another sinkhole opened up between two homes in Seffner, Florida on Monday, just two miles from the one which swallowed Jeff Bush on Thursday . Nearby: A map shows the distance between the first sinkhole (on Faithway Drive) and the second (Cedar Tree Lane) in Seffner, Florida . Missing: Authorities said they may never recover the body of Jeff Bush . 'For me, no is strange because... the hole is little,' she said. Puz said the latest sinkhole appears to be unrelated to the one that opened last Thursday. 'It is not geologically connected,' Puz said. Dirt now fills the sinkhole on the Seffner lot where a home once stood. With it being sealed, it has effectively become a tomb for Jeff Bush, who was killed when the floor opened up last week. Bush disappeared into the hole that opened up under his bedroom on Thursday night in a scene his brother, Jeremy Bush, likened to a horror movie. The other occupants of the house, which is owned by the family of Jeremy Bush's fiancee, had been preparing for bed when they heard a loud crash and Jeff Bush screaming. Jeremy ran to help his brother but could only hear his screams. Firefighters arrived on the scene and pulled Jeremy away from the edge of the chasm. On Monday, demolition crews returned to Bush's home to demolish the rest of the house - revealing the massive hole for the first time - before efforts will begin to stabilize the sinkhole. Two nearby houses have been evacuated as the sinkhole has weakened the ground, and the residents probably will never be allowed inside again, said Jessica Damico of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue. Bush, a landscaper who mowed highway medians for a living, had moved into the four-bedroom home only two months ago which he shared with his brother, Jeremy Bush, 36, and four others. The other adults, a two-year-old child and a dog were at the home at the time the sinkhole opened, but were not injured. Demolition: Authorities believe the hole which swallowed Jeff Bush beneath this home was 60-ft deep and continue to carry out tests on the ground . Hidden danger: Authorities believe the sinkhole could stretch under neighbours' homes and they have been evacuated . Workers recovered a family Bible, . flag, military medals, a purse, teddy bears and generations of photos . from the site. On Monday they also recovered two antique rifles that . were family heirlooms. Engineers placed listening devices, microphones, ground-penetrating radar and other equipment to test the soil to find whether it was safe to work and to look for any sign of life below. They have detected no such sign ever since the hole opened up late on Thursday. Jeremy Bush said the family was discussing plans for a memorial service and a possible marker at the site. 'I'm the only one who tried to get him out,' he said, while begging county authorities to do more to find his brother's body when the lot is cleared. The property's owner Buddy Wicker says he want's nothing to do with the home. He says he'd love a memorial placed there for Jeff Bush but the whole sequence of events made for a bizarre occurrence. Sadness: A family member prays in front of home where Jeff Bush was killed before demolition crews tear it down . Hope: Jeremy Bush, who tried to save his brother from the sinkhole as he was sucked from his room, prays as he speaks to the media . Sinkholes in Florida are caused by the state's porous geological bedrock, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. As acidic rainwater filters into the ground, it dissolves the rock, causing erosion that can lead to underground caverns, which cause sinkholes when they collapse. 'There's hardly a place in Florida . that's immune to sinkholes,' Sandy Nettles, who owns a geology . consulting company in the Tampa area. 'There's no way of ever predicting where a sinkhole is going to occur.' Watch out: Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . A sinkhole is a hole that opens . up suddenly in the ground. They mostly occur because of erosion or . underground water that gathers naturally or due to man-made activities. When . this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer, spaces . and caverns develop underground. Limestone, carbonate rock, . and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion. Meanwhile, . the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. When the dissolving area . beneath the surface becomes too large, the surface suddenly gives way.

Miss Thompson was 16 and left grammar school to help run the business after her father died and, along with her mother and her uncle, she worked from dawn until dusk. Goods in sacks and tea chests were collected from the railway station by horse and cart. Her uncle died in 1961 and her mother in 1982, leaving Miss Thompson, now 85, to run the shop alone until she retired in 2004 after a fall. Her friend Pat Duggan said: 'The shop was her whole life and she kept it going as long as she could. In 1880, Edward D.

She didn't think that was right. 'She is very proud of her family and rightly so - Thompson's is famous, even in America and Australia.' Estate agent Robin Jessop is selling the property at auction on May 15, along with the family's two-bedroom cottage next door, which has a guide price for £100,000. He says: 'It was Miss Thompson's wish that it should remain a village shop and the parish council and the York North Moors National Park have both supported the restrictive covenant. 'It is an iconic property with a tremendous position and a lot of history. It must be the oldest grocery store in North Yorkshire and perhaps beyond.'

Former International Space Station commander Suni Williams has lifted the lid on how astronauts aboard go to the toilet in space. Personnel aboard the ISS often spend months at a time in space, so effective facilities for using the smallest room in zero gravity are essential. Captain Williams, who holds the record for the longest space flight by a woman at 195 days, revealed details of the 'orbital outhouse' in a video tour of the station. Stinky: Former International Space Station commander Suni Williams demonstrates the orbiter's smallest room in space in a Nasa video . Her tour of the £12.5million facilities showed that it is apparently all a case of docking and alignment when it comes to going to the toilet in space. The toilet, she explains, unsurprisingly 'serves for two functions' - number one and number two - with different colour-coded receptacles to accept each. Pointing out the number two loo, she says: 'You see it's pretty small and you have to have pretty good aim, and be ready to make sure things get let go in the right direction.' Pinching her nose, she adds: 'And it smells a little bit, so I'm closing it up.' This is for number ones... Captain Williams holds up the colour-coded tube where astronauts urinate . And this is for number two: Both units have suction 'to keep things going in the right direction', she revealed . 'Also there's a selection of paper,' she says, including a soft kind for U.S. astronauts and a coarser, rough variety preferred by Russian cosmonauts. Captain Williams, a U.S. Navy test pilot pilot who has over seven missions spend a total of almost 322 days in space, says the crew are provided with gloves, nappies and disinfectant wipes, 'in case things really get out of control'. 'The number one stuff can get really all over the place if you don't aim correctly,' she warns. Although, she adds, both toilets have a little bit of suction to keep things 'going in the right direction'. For that fresh feeling: Captain Williams points out the baby wipes made available for astronauts . A little privacy please...

One of the pumps in the crew's main bathroom flooded, which is connected to the station's wastewater-recycling system. Astronauts were forced to don goggles, gloves and masks for some impromptu plumbing. They ripped apart the compartment, working well into the evening but failed to solve the problem until spare parts were sent from Earth.","Captain Sunita Williams hosts a video tour around the stations facilities .

Mobile phone users will soon be viewing images in 3D thanks to a revolutionary display unveiled for the first time today. The new three-dimensional display, which doesn't need special glasses and is particularly suited for smaller devices, has been developed by U.S. electronics firm Hewlett-Packard. Its inventors say it could revolutionise data visualisation, medical training and entertainment with a high resolution that makes it ideal for multi-view 3D display applications. A 3D image of an HP logo in RGB, from a completely transparent substrate: The company today unveiled its revolutionary new 3D display which would be perfect for mobile devices . Both static and moving images can be viewed in full colour from multiple angles at a distance of up to three feet away - even when the device is tilted. The success of blockbusters like Avatar and Alice In Wonderland has whetted the appetite of the public for 3D, but such films can only be seen in their full glory by viewers wearing special glasses. However this technology, which makes use of an effect known as 'diffractive optics' where an obstacle causes light waves to deflect, works on the naked eye. Alternative methods researchers have tried to create easily accessed 3D images have included holographs, but they proved expensive and too slow for real-time operation. Applying optical tricks to create 3D depth to mobile devices is difficult because the display needs to be thin, high-resolution and have a wide view zone. But the backlit display developed by Dr David Fattal and colleagues at Hewlett-Packard's laboratories in Palo Alto in California overcomes these challenges. The key element is a set light-emitting diodes and a thin structure called a waveguide that controls electromagnetic waves in the optical spectrum. Dr Fattal, a quantum scientist, said none of the leading multiview 3D solutions is particularly well suited to mobile devices such as watches, cellphones or tablets which require high resolution and a short viewing distance from potentially steep angles. Breakthrough: A scanning electron microscope picture of the backlight surface for the HP logo shown on the above picture. It shows a close packed array of grating pixels . 'Here we introduce a multi-directional diffractive backlight technology that permits the rendering of high-resolution, full-parallax 3D images in a very wide view zone - up to 180 degrees in principle - at an observation distance of up to a metre,' he said.

The key element is a set light-emitting diodes and a thin structure called a waveguide that controls electromagnetic waves in the optical spectrum. Researchers used ink-printed patterns or high resolution commercial liquid-crystal displays to project static images or animated sequences into a screen in a view zone of 90 degrees to illustrate its capabilities.

Professor Neil Dodgson, of the computer laboratory at Cambridge University, reviewed the invention for the journal Nature. He said it could be a 'compelling alternative', but cautioned that it could be as much as a decade before it is being used by consumers because it must be manufactured reliably, robustly and in quantity. 'This is a matter of careful engineering that can take a long time,' he said. 'I am reminded of the nine-year development of Texas Instruments' digital micro-mirror device - now widely used in digital projectors - between the invention in 1987 and the first commercial product in 1996.

If the Duchess of Cambridge and Kim Kardashian want to be prepared for the arrival of their impending babies, they'd better make sure they have at least £2,500 tucked away in the baby bank. The cost of preparing for a newborn has shot up to to £2,547, and a significant proportion of parents-to-be are being forced to take out bank loans, borrow from families or use their savings just to afford the bare essentials, according to research. Moreover, 30 per cent of parents worry about how they will pay these debts back, and 40 per cent are concerned about how they will be able to save for their children's future.

A man chased and gunned down his 20-year-old ex-girlfriend in her car before barricading himself in his home and taking his own life as a SWAT team swarmed outside. Kaitlin Gerber, 20, was followed by her ex-boyfriend Jashua Prez, 29, as she drove to work in Toledo, Ohio and, as he shot at her, she crashed her car in a parking lot. Authorities are uncertain whether she had been shot before crashing her car, but said that Prez approached the stopped vehicle and fired several more times. Prez then fled south to his home in Maumee and barricaded himself inside as a SWAT team gathered outside the property. Horror: Jashua Prez, left, chased his ex-girlfriend Kaitlin Gerber, right, as she drove to work and shot at her, causing her to crash her car. He then went over to her vehicle and shot her several more times . Crisis negotiators spoke with him by phone for several hours, and at some points he indicated that he was going to emerge, the Toledo Blade reported. But when a SWAT team forced their way into his home shortly before 5 p.m. on Sunday, they found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Gerber's family said her death was the culmination of months of stalking, threats and harassment by Prez, whom she had met while working in a restaurant ahead of applying to college. When their relationship turned sour . last year, she was forced to dye her hair so Prez would not recognise . her, and after he sent her reams of letters to her workplace, she . contacted authorities. Scene: He then barricaded himself in his Ohio home, pictured, as SWAT team members arrived . Fraught: After a five-hour stand off, the SWAT team entered the home and found Prez dead . But her father, Jeff Gerber, believes they did not do enough to help her. He said they reported an incident where Prez turned up at her workplace and threatened to kill her with a knife. She later  obtained a restraining order against him. He was charged on February 6 with four misdemeanor counts of violating the order after he continued to call and write to his ex-girlfriend. But the cases were dismissed three weeks later on the recommendation of the prosecutor's office. 'This guy was in jail for violent . behavior and he broke a protection order,' he said. 'He was a monster. A . real monster. The criminal justice system has completely disappointed . us.' The family said that, on the day of . the murder-suicide, Miss Gerber had seen Prez's car outside her home on . Sunday and when she started driving to work, he began following her. Fears: Gerber, 20, had previously contacted authorities with her concerns that Prez was stalking her . In hiding: She dyed her hair, changed her car and moved in with her parents as she tried to hide from Prez . 'She drove off to protect the rest of the . home,' her father said. 'He was a monster.' She frantically called 911 at 11.30 a.m. to report that an ex-boyfriend was chasing her in her car with a gun. Witnesses also called 911 to report that a man was shooting at a woman in a car. She came to a stop on the sidewalk outside a shopping center. Prez drove up to her car and fired several more rounds, Steve Kahle, a Lucas County Coroner’s Office investigator, said. When officers reached her, she was dead from the gunshot wounds. 'It's a very sad situation,' Sergeant Heffernan said. 'It is unusual to have somebody being chased through the streets getting fired at. It’s just sad to see this young lady had to lose her life in this manner. It's just a tragedy.' Loss: She was remembered as an ambitious young woman who hoped to attend the University of Toledo . Police tracked the vehicle to Prez's nearby home and SWAT team members were sent to the address, where they administered tear gas. But when they gained access to the house, he had killed himself. 'I think it did go well in regard to the fact that no police officers were injured, no citizens, and no other threats were posted to the community at large,' Maumee Police Lt. Jeff Siebenaler told the Blade. 'It’s unfortunate it ended the way it did, but the reality is, that's his decision.' Miss Gerber worked at a car dealership and a restaurant and was hoping to attend the University of Toledo to study either pharmacology or chemical engineering, her father said.","Jashua Prez shot at Kaitlin Gerber as she drove to work in Toledo, Ohio .

A German court has convicted a woman of manslaughter and sentenced her to nine years in prison for killing five of her newborn babies. The 29-year-old woman, whose name has not been released - in keeping with German privacy rules - turned herself in to authorities last September. Prosecutors said then that she killed the infants shortly after giving birth in secret at home or in the woods, because she worried her husband would leave her if she had any more children. Grim: Prosecutor Ulrike Stahlmann-Liebelt (pictured right, with Dirk Czarnetzki, of Flensburg police) said the woman was afraid her husband would leave her because he did not want more children . The state court in Flensburg, on Germany's border with Denmark, convicted her today of five counts of manslaughter, the DPA news agency reported. Prosecutors had sought a 10-year sentence and the defense a seven-year term. The babies were born between 2006 and 2012. The woman has two living children. She turned herself in after police took a DNA sample, and confessed to killing the children. The case had been under investigation . since a newborn baby's body was found in a paper-recycling plant near . the city in 2006. A second body was found in a car park in 2007, according to the BBC. Discoveries: The woman handed herself in to police in the town of Flensburg, Germany (pictured) Three further bodies were found in the cellar of the woman's house. Prosecutor Ulrike Stahlmann-Liebelt told a news conference in Flensburg in September that the woman was afraid her husband would leave her because he did not want any more children. He knew nothing of the five births, she said. The case is one of a number of infanticides in Germany in recent years. In 2006, a woman was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison for killing eight of her newborn babies and burying them, the BBC reports.","Mother sentenced to nine years in prison for killings .

Examined: Convicted arsonist Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in 2004 for the murder of his three children. The evidence from the fire at his home is being re-examined . Evidence used to convict a man who was executed nine years ago for killing his three children in a fire - is to be re-examined. Cameron . Todd Willingham was put to death in 2004 after being found guilty of deliberately setting fire to his family's home in Corsicana, Texas in 1991. But the evidence used to convict him is now to be reassessed by the state's fire . marshal and the 'Innocence Project' of Texas as part of a wider review of dozens of past convictions for arson. Authorities in Texas and in other . states are beginning to re-examine cases in which defendants were sent . to prison for setting fires based on expert testimony about burn . patterns and charring that today is considered suspect. The Innocence Project, a national . legal reform group that has worked to exonerate more than 250 convicts, . has identified potentially problematic arson cases in several states, . including one in Tucson, Arizona, in 1970 in which 29 people were . killed. In Texas, which has had to free more . than 100 inmates wrongly convicted in criminal cases, the state . Innocence Project has narrowed its working list to about 60 arson cases . of the 1,000 reviewed, chief counsel Jeff Blackburn said. A state expert panel, the Texas . Forensic Science Commission, has also made 17 recommendations for . improving how arson cases are handled. The widespread attention given the Willingham case has driven interest in looking at other arson-related convictions. Willingham was convicted of killing . his children after deliberately starting a fire the family's home in . Corsicana, Texas on December 23, 1991. He was executed in 2004. The Forensic Science Commission . investigated the case for years, but was barred by Attorney General Greg . Abbott from issuing a final report. Arson experts hired by the . commission found the 1991 fire was most likely accidental. It is . possible that problems will be found with more cases, State Fire Marshall Chris Connealy said. Execution: The Polunsky Unit West Livingston, Texas, where Willingham was executed . 'Having been around fire investigations and being in the fire service the last 35 years, I saw where there could be improvements,' he added. 'I wanted to try to lead that effort to improving fire investigations. It should be based on science.' If the group finds problems with an . arson investigation, its findings will be sent to the authorities with . jurisdiction over the case and to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, . Connealy said. No action will be required, but the report could help . someone who is wrongly imprisoned . Convicted: Ed Graf is one of a number of men convicted of arson whose cases are now being re-examined by the authorities . Another case to be reviewed is that of . Ed Graf - who was given life in prison 25 years ago for killing his two . stepsons by locking them in a backyard shed and setting it on fire. Two . investigators used photos of the shed's remains to persuade jurors that . Graf had started the fire intentionally. But by today's standards of . fire analysis - the investigators may have been mistaken. Representatives will meet next month to start reviewing the first six . cases, including Graf's, who was convicted in 1988 of setting the deadly . fire in the central Texas town of Hewitt. Graf is now a white-haired, 60-year-old man, who in a recent prison interview continued to maintain his innocence. 'I know that there will be people that . will never change their mind, and of course, there will be people that . will,' Graf said. 'It's difficult for me to believe they can't believe . the science. The science, it's pretty accurate now.' Graf's then-wife, Clare Bradburn, said she remains convinced he is guilty. Ms Bradburn said she remembers Graf acting suspiciously before and after the blaze. Of the new questions about the arson investigation, she said, 'He got lucky. This might be his get-out-of-jail-free card.' A final decision on a new trial is pending before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Mr Connealy would not take a position on Graf's innocence but wants to address any problems with old cases. 'I really won't know, personally, until we get into this,' he said. And that first opportunity will be in April.'","Cameron .

Overweight people have an in-built ‘fat-nav’ that helps them remember where high-calorie food is, a study suggests. The discovery comes after psychologists at the University of Aberdeen asked 41 students to imagine they were going to a food fair. They were then shown images of fruit and vegetables and high-calorie snacks, and briefly shown the location of stalls selling them. In tests, those who were better at remembering where to buy fatty snacks were more likely to have a higher body mass index – which compares height with weight. Overweight people have an in-built 'fat-nav' that helps them remember where high-calorie food is . The trait may have helped our ancestors survive when food was in short supply, by pointing them towards energy-rich options. The latest research suggests it may explain why some find it so hard to resist over-consumption of calorie dense snacks, even though food is in abundance.Obesity has emerged as a major burden on the NHS. Recent figures showed the number of people admitted to hospital for obesity-related illnesses has shot up by more than 10 times in the past decade. These range from surgery to have gastric bands fitted or undergo gastric bypass procedures, to weight-related ailments such as breathing difficulties and even organ failure. Health experts predict Britain’s obesity epidemic will cost the NHS and the economy £60bn annually by 2050. Previous research has highlighted that both men and women have a better spatial memory for high calorie foods instead of low calorie ones. Spatial memory is where we store information about our immediate environment. When our predecessors were foraging for foods, the ability to recall the location of energy-rich items would have been crucial for survival. The research found that students who were better at remembering where to buy fatty snacks had a higher body mass index . The latest research, led by Dr Kevin Allan, from the School of Psychology at Aberdeen University, looked at whether there was a direct link between this evolutionary trait and body mass index, a measure of weight compared to height. He recruited 41 female students with body mass index ratings varying from 18.5 to 30. Anything between 18 and 25 is judged to be healthy but a score of 30 or more is classed as obese.Researchers chose women for the study because the evidence suggests they have a better memory for the location of ‘gatherable’ foodstuffs than men. The volunteers were told to imagine they were at an international food fair with 24 stalls. They were then shown images of either healthy fruit and vegetables or calorie-loaded snacks and the location of the stall selling them, before these details were taken away from them. Participants were asked to think about how desirable each food item was and to try and remember where on the map each one came from. The results, published online in the journal Appetite, showed women who were better able to remember which stalls sold the snack foods were also more likely to have a higher body mass index. In a report on their findings the researchers said: ‘Improved spatial memory for high-calorie snacks predicted higher and less healthy body mass index. ‘In contrast, no significant relationship existed between women’s BMI and spatial memory for fruits and vegetables. ‘These findings reveal, for the first time to our knowledge, a link between spatial memory function and weight gain in the modern urban food environment.’","Researchers at University of Aberdeen gave 41 students memory test .

The mother of a CNN reporter who has just been named as the co-host of the network's new morning show is reportedly facing jail for crashing into a man and injuring him while she was drunk driving. The network announced on Thursday that Kate Bolduan, 29, will co-host its new flagship breakfast show alongside former Good Morning America host and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's brother, Chris Cuomo, when it starts later this spring. But new job jitters will not be the only anxiety Bolduan faces next month as her mother, 60-year-old Nadine Bolduan, faces sentencing after pleading guilty to driving while intoxicated and injuring a man. It comes nearly 20 years after Mrs Bolduan was also charged with reckless homicide after her jet ski struck two children, killing a nine-year-old girl and injuring a 10-year-old. Trouble back home: CNN's new morning host, Kate Bolduan (left), could see her mother, Nadine Bolduan (right), go to prison next month when she is sentenced for driving while drunk and injuring a man . Mrs Bolduan, a former nurse who has three other daughters and is married to Dr Jeffrey Bolduan, was charged following the crash near the family's hometown of Goshen, Indiana, on May 31, 2012, around 2pm, according to local reports. Her Chevrolet Avalanche collided nearly head-on with a Buick LaSabre driven by Paul Fought who was on his way home from work. He was pinned in the vehicle by the crash, the Goshen News reported. CNN said they would not be commenting on the charges against Kate Bolduan's mother, while Bolduan's attorneys did not return MailOnline's request for comment. There was no answer at the family home in Goshen last night. Mr Fought, 59, suffered leg fractures, a head injury, a fractured . elbow bone, torn muscles in his shoulder and three brain bleeds. He had nine surgeries and still requires shoulder and leg therapy. He told Mail Online that it had been a long road to recovery but he had found it in his heart to forgive Bolduan. 'By the grace of God, I have healed very well. Last May 31st they weren't even sure I would make it through the night. Today I limp and I have some pain in my arm but I am hoping with exercise it will be better. It has been a year-long process,' he said. 'I just attended the deposition which was attended by Nadine and her husband so we had an opportunity to speak to them face-to-face. She was very, very sorry for what had happened - very remorseful - it was good for all of us. 'I told Nadine when we met with them that we had forgiven them.' 'She and her husband said on oath that she doesn't drink, however that day she did for whatever reason.' Family support: Kate Bolduan, center, has three sisters and her father, Jeff, is a doctor in Goshen, Indiana . Bolduan testified earlier this month that she had drunk two glasses of red wine before the crash and was intoxicated. Her blood-alcohol level was over the legal limit at 0.19 per cent, according to local reports. She will be sentenced on April 11 and faces a possible year in jail. She also faces a suspension of her driving privileges for up to five years and will have to serve a year on probation. Mr Fought has spoken to the judge and prosecutors to say that she should be given community service. He said she should be made to interact with 'victims of drunk driving' to understand the consequences of what she did, but jail, in her case, isn't 'the answer'. While Bolduan's attorneys told Goshen News that she has no prior criminal history, reports show she was charged with reckless homicide in 1994 after her jet ski hit two children on Syracuse Lake. Elizabeth Leman, 9, was killed and Christa Konarski, 10, was injured as the Bolduans raced their jet skis between two boats, hitting inner-tubes the girls were riding, according to a 1995 Kokomo Tribune report. Hurt: Paul Fought, pictured with his wife Nancy, still undergoes physical therapy following the crash last year . But in 1995 the charges were dismissed as the court's prosecutor said he believed the actions were negligent, but did not constitute recklessness, the News reported. The case moved to the civil courts in Elkhart County, where Nadine and her husband Jeffrey Bolduan were ordered to pay the Konarski family more than $1 million. Judging by Facebook pictures and . comments made by Kate in the media, the Bolduans are a tight-knit family . who still have close links to each other. Kate has long left Indiana. She . studied journalism at The George Washington University where she was a . college athlete in volleyball before moving to North Carolina and most . recently Washington D.C. where she works as congressional . correspondent of 'The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer' on CNN. Married: Kate, the youngest co-host of any network morning show, with her husband Michael Gershenson . Politics beat: Kate Bolduan will say farewell to Congress and take up her more prestigious post this Spring . When she was just 11 she credited her mother for her own achievements. 'My mom was a registered nurse when our family moved to . Goshen,' she told The Elkhart Truth in 2000. 'Once my little sister was born, she's been here for us full . time.' The report noted that Mrs Bolduan volunteered at the middle school, helped coach the junior cheerleaders and assisted at First English Lutheran Church. 'My parents made me the . person I am. My life, my ambitions, my drive come from my parents,' Kate added. 'They've never pushed me in anything, they've allowed me to make my own . decisions and my own mistakes.' Following . the announcement of her new job on Thursday, she said it was 'a huge opportunity' and . expressed her excitement in joining Cuomo and Michaela Pereira from KTLA .

Deputies on the hunt for a Florida couple accused of kidnapping their two young sons now believe that the family may be on board a sailboat after their pickup truck was discovered abandoned in Madeira Beach. The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said Friday that 35-year-old Joshua Michael Hakken recently bought a 25-foot 1972 Morgan sailboat with a blue hull with the word 'Salty' painted on it and white paw prints on both sides. The boat's whereabouts are unknown. The vessel bears Florida Boat Registration #FL3717BK, HUL #M252099. There may be a yellow horseshoe life preserver on deck. New twist: Officials say suspected kidnapper Joshua Hakken recently bought a 25-foot 1972 Morgan sailboat with a blue hull, and they suspect he and his family are on it now . By land and by sea: The hull of the boat has the word 'Salty' painted on it and white paw prints on both sides (left), and officials believe the Hakkens planned all along to use the vessel in the abduction plot . Last sighting: The family were seen sailing in their boat underneath the John¿s Pass Bridge towards the Gulf of Mexico after ditching their truck . Hillsborough Sheriff's spokesman Larry McKinnon told ABC Action News that the U.S. Coast Guard along, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation commission and other agencies will be searching for the boat on the water and from the air. The official said that it appears that boat was part of the Hakkens' coordinated abduction plan, and that it is possible that they have returned back on dry land and switched to another vehicle by now. 'These are not dumb people. They're very intelligent people with some emotional issues,' McKinnon said. 'Our goal is to still resolve this peacefully.' According to McKinnon, after ditching their GMC pickup truck in a parking garage in Madeira Beach near the marina on the day of the kidnapping, the parents and their toddler sons, Cole and Chase, were seen sailing in their boat underneath the John’s Pass Bridge towards the Gulf of Mexico, Bay News 9 reported. Law enforcement officials will be checking all inlets and intercoastal waterways from the Panhandle in all the way to Naples in search of the family. The pickup truck that police say Hakken had used to abduct his two sons from their grandmother's home earlier this week was found abandoned in a Madeira Beach parking garage Thursday night.

I am absolutely devoted to life, liberty, the rights of the individual and the Constitution of the United States of America.' Hakken lamented that 'things here in Florida have not added up for quite some time,' and emphasized the importance of 'maintaining open communication lines for ideas, observations and news...if the ""good guys"" are to be successful in surviving to maintain the fight of ideas.' The couple own a home in the Virginia Park area south of Palma Ceia, where neighbors described them as a normal, average family. While Robert Lucas said the Hakkens were not overly outgoing, that did not seem like bad people.

A mansion near San Diego where millionaire Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend and six-year-old son died in 2011 is about to go on sale for $16.9 million, it has emerged. The 10-bedroom oceanfront home in Coronado will reportedly be listed in the next four to six weeks. Shacknai, the CEO and founder of Arizona-based Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp., owns the historic house known as Spreckels Mansion, and has carried out extensive renovations since the tragedies. In July 2011, Shacknai's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau was found bound and hanging from the mansion's balcony two days after Shacknai's son Max was fatally injured after falling down the stairs. House of horrors: A mansion owned by millionaire Jonah Shacknai - where his son sustained fatal injuries in a fall three days before his girlfriend was found hanged there - is going on sale for $16.9 million . Investigators called Max's death an accident and Zahau's a suicide, but Max's mother and Zahau's family have both called the deaths suspicious. Scott Aurich, of Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty, told U-T San Diego the home has received a top-to-bottom renovation, but no changes have been made to the balcony where Zahau was found. The renovations were carried out after Shacknai entered into a deal with a group of investors, but Aurich would not disclose the nature of the deal or the people involved. The updates include a new roof, refurbished wood flooring and improvements to several rooms, including the master bedroom and the kitchen, U-T San Diego reported. Tragic: Max Shacknai, six, died after he fell down the stairs at the home. Days later, Rebecca Zahau, the girlfriend of Max's father, was found bound and hanged from an outside balcony at the mansion . Lavish: The oceanfront, historic home near San Diego has 10 bedrooms and 9-and-a-half bathrooms . Shacknai bought the 10-bedroom, nine-and-a-half bathroom home for $12.75 million in March 2007. The listing describes the property as 'one of the premier oceanfront beach . compounds in all of Southern California... overlooking one of the most beautiful beaches in the world!' The home gets its name from John D. Spreckels, a sugar baron who was once the wealthiest man in San Diego and who financed the home more than a century ago. The mansion hit headlines two years ago for the deaths, which have been deemed suspicious by family members of the deceased. Max Shacknai's mother Dina Shacknai, who had a turbulent relationship with his father, was so unconvinced that her son's death was an accident that she hired her own team of investigators. Loss: Zahau was dating millionaire businessman Jonah Shacknai (pictured together), who owned the home . They reported that her son's death was not an accident. 'He was a victim of assault and a victim of homicide,' Dina Shacknai told NBC News last August. 'Even though nothing will bring my only child Maxie back, I owe it to him, as his mother, to make sure the true facts of his death are known.' The official police investigation into the death of Max found that the boy tumbled over a railing and fell down the stairs. The little boy is said to have hit the carpeted floor face first which fractured his forehead and when paramedics arrived he was not breathing and did not have a pulse. Questions: Max's mother, Dina Shacknai, hired investigators who said he had been assaulted and killed . He died one week later at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. Max Shacknai was in the care of his father's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau at the time of his death, but her family members said it was 'preposterous' she would be involved in his death. Zahau was found by Jonah Shacknai hanging from an outside balcony at the home days after Max's tragic fall. She was naked, gagged and her hands and feet bound. Zahau's family has also commissioned their own private investigation. Her sister said she spoke with her the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she planned to take her life.","Max Shacknai, 6, sustained fatal injuries after falling down the staircase at his father's California mansion in July 2011 .

There are tens of millions of wine lovers in China . It has supplied fine wines and other vintage beverages to the Royal Family since the reign of King George III. But now Britain's oldest wine merchant is focusing on the future by stocking claret from China - reflecting the astonishing growth of the country's wine industry. Berry Bros & Rudd - which has been based in St James', London, since 1698 - now sells four kinds of Chinese wine. The firm has tapped into the growing taste for wine in Asia, and now has offices in Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai. Its decision to stock Chinese wine is a major boon for the country's winemakers as Berry Bros & Rudd has supplied the Royal Family since the 1700s. The Chinese wines the firm stocks are sourced from European grapes and were bought from Château Changyu - the world's tenth largest winery, The Times reports. The drink is increasingly popular with China's expanding middles classes, with more than 1.6 billion bottles already consumed in the country each year. Perhaps unsurprisingly China is on course to becoming the World's largest consumer of wine - and is the eighth largest producer. One of the four wines stocked by Berry Bros is a red from Changyu, while the other three are sweet, 'ice wines' made from frozen grapes, according to The Times. They include a 2008 Chateau Changyu Moser priced at £39. Wine production in China is aided by the similarity in climate in parts of the nation to key wine growing regions in Europe. Concerns have been raised over the amount of 'fake' European or New World wines that are available on the black market. However, the best Chinese wine is now competing with vintage from more established nations in Europe and the New World and could become a common sight on British supermarket shelves. Historic: Berry Bros & Rudd has been based in St James' London since 1698 and has long supplied the Royal Family with wine . Class: A visitor smells a glass of Italian wine at a Shanghai trade fair.

Ningxia province is also noted for its high quality wines, with some winning prestigious industry awards for quality.","Berry Bros & Rudd is 300-years-old and supplies wine to the Royal Family .

"By . Steve Robson . PUBLISHED: . 14:43 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:37 EST, 18 March 2013 . A letter written by Victorian novelist Charles Dickens documenting his first-ever novel is expected to fetch £400 when it goes up for auction. The beautifully written note accompanied the first-ever bound copy of Dickens' first novel, the Pickwick Papers. Dated Monday evening, December 11 1837, the letter is written to his friend and later biographer John Forster, offering him a copy of the literature. Unique: The beautifully crafted letter from Charles Dickens' addressed to his friend and biographer John Forster is set to go on sale . A first bound edition of Pickwick Papers from 1837. It was originally published as a 20-part serial . It reads: 'My Dear Forster, Chapman and Hall have just sent me three extra super bound copies of Pickwick - as per specimen enclosed. The first I forward to you, the second I have presented to a good friend Ainsworth and the third Kate has retained for herself. Accept your copy, with kind regards, from your affectionate friend Charles Dickens.' The Pickwick Papers was Dickens' first work to receive public acclaim. Written at the tender age of 24, Dickens balanced writing this episodic work with his job as a court reporter. Chapman and Hall approached Dickens with their concept of writing lines to accompany their comic 'cockney sporting plates' by illustrator Robert Seymour. However, Dickens rarely adjusted his narrative to plates that had been prepared for him. Typically, he himself led the way with an installment of his story, and the artist was compelled to illustrate what Dickens had already written. The story thus became the prime source of interest, and the illustrations merely of secondary importance. The serialisation of The Pickwick Papers launched Charles Dickens as an international literary celebrity . Literary genesis: The Pickwick Papers was Dickens' first work to receive public acclaim . By this reversal of interest, Dickens transformed, at a stroke, a current type of fiction, consisting mostly of pictures, into a novel of contemporary London life. While still working on his Pickwick Papers (1836-37), Dickens was contracted to write two more novels and started publishing Oliver Twist (1837-38). Auctioneer Charles Hanson, who will be selling the letter at auction on Friday in Derby, said: 'This letter, written by Dickens himself, is a rare and fascinating thing. 'I can't help but imagine a young Dickens writing by candlelight, with immense excitement at his first literary success. Keen to share his first work with his dear friend and biographer John Forster, historical novelist William Harrison Ainsworth, and his wife, Kate, this would have been frantically scribbled and swiftly put in the post.' Long career: Charles Dickens was a prolific writer during more than 30 years as an author . Charles Dickens, the greatest novelist of the Victorian era, was yet to discover fame as an author when he excitedly wrote the letter above. Born in Portsmouth in 1812, he left school early to work in a factory and had little education. His anger at the conditions that working class people had to live in became major themes of his work. His experience working in a blacking factory was never forgotten and inspired two of his novels 'David Copperfield' and 'Great Expectations'. During his career he edited weekly journals, wrote 15 novels and five novellas as well as hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles. Like many others, he began his career as a journalist. While working for The Morning Chronicle he also began writing sketches under the pseudonym 'Boz'.

One ton cake stand: Christopher Lawrence, 78, a silversmith from Essex was commissioned by the Sultan of Oman to handcraft the masterpiece . Flown by private plane from Essex to Oman, this £1 million cake stand was commissioned by the Sultan of Oman to give his tea times a touch of English elegance. The 14ft-high solid silver masterpiece was made by Christopher Lawrence, 78, a silversmith from Westcliff, Essex. He proudly made it for the Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said, 72, who has an estimated £470m fortune. Master silversmith Mr Lawrence created the cake stand 14 years ago, but has only now revealed the story. The lavish one ton cake stand still serves the Sultan's guests at his palace in the Gulf. Mr Lawrence explained: 'It was made in my workshop at home, and I then had to check that it all fitted together. So I erected it in the garden. The neighbours didn't bat an eyelid.' The cake stand was then transported to the Middle East in one of the sultan's two private planes. Mr Lawrence, who has just received a lifetime achievement award from Princess Michael of Kent, said: 'It needed 28 packing cases to contain it all.' The cake stand was ordered by the Sultan, a keen anglophile, because he wanted to reproduce English style . tea parties, with an Arabian touch. Hospitable: The Sultan of Oman holds lavish receptions at which each guest receives a piece of one vast cake on arrival as a welcome . Pride of place: The cake stand is likely to be at the Sultan's main residence, the Al Alam Palace in Muscat . Mr Lawrence explained: 'Cake is very . central to their culture and notions of hospitality. It goes back to the . days when guests to a sultan's tent were offered cakes baked in a hole . in the ground.' The tradition has been modernised but the gesture remains the same. On arrival, guests at one of the Sultan of Oman's receptions are offered a slice cut from a vast cake. The Sultan has been a particular fan of Britain since his stint at military academy Sandhurst, Berkshire, to which he donated a sports pavilion as a sign of his happy time there. He served with the now defunct Cameronian regiment and spent six months learning about local British government in Suffolk County Council before returning home to Oman. Fellow royals: The Sultan of Oman at Buckingham Palace during his State Visit in 1983 . Anglophile Sultan: The Sultan of Oman Qaboos bin Said Al-Said welcomed then Prime Minister Tony Blair, left, to his palace at Muscat . Sultan Qaboos seized power in a coup against his father, Said Bin Taimur, in 1970 and has ruled ever since. The Sultan's fortune derives from oil though recently he has invested much of it building up Oman's tourism industry. Mr Lawrence said that he resisted any temptation to serve tea from the stand while it was still in his back garden: 'Somehow I don't think a Mr Kipling cake would have done this particular stand justice.' Prince Charles and The Duchess of Cornwall as the Sultan's guests may well be having a slice from the cake stand from Essex on their visit later this month.","Christopher Lawrence assembled the one ton stand in his Essex garden .

But only three of the new Lamborghini Venenos - described as a 'street legal racing car' - will be built and sold; and they already have buyers. The £9million trio have been built specially to celebrate the Italian supercar firm’s 50th anniversary and each will carry a different colour from Italy’s national flag – green, white and red. Scroll down for video . Sueprcar: The exclusive new 220mph Lamborghini Veneno, which has a £3million price tag . Speed: The car is expected to be able to accelerate from rest to 60mph in under 3 seconds . The two-seater Veneno is powered by a massive 6.5 litre 12 cylinder petrol engine developing 750 horse-power – equivalent to seven Ford Fiestas – linked to a seven speed manual gear-box with five different driving modes and permanent all-wheel drive, which Lamborghini says delivers ‘a thrilling combination of absolute high-revving frenzy and phenomenal pulling power’. It is expected to accelerate from rest to 60mph in under 3 seconds. Lamborghini described the ‘extremely exclusive’ Veneno as ‘a racing prototype and road-going super sports car’ based on the Lamborghini Aventador. It was unveiled on the eve of the Geneva Motor show in Switzerland at a special evening event hosted by the parent Volkswagen Group at which Britain’s Bentley also showcased its new Flying Spur. The supercar firm said: 'Only three unique units of the Lamborghini Veneno will be built and sold. 'Its design is consistently focused on optimum aerodynamics, giving the Veneno the look of a racing prototype, yet it holds a regular road license.'

Power: The two-seater Veneno is powered by a massive 6.5 litre 12 cylinder petrol engine developing 750 horse-power, equivalent to seven Ford Fiestas . Lightweight but super-strong carbon fibre materials form the single cell or monocoque chassis as well as the outer skin of the ‘extreme sports car’ with an aluminium sub-frame and ‘scissor doors’ which open up and out. A spokesman for Lamborghini said: 'Fully in keeping with the tradition of the brand, the name of the Veneno originates from a legendary fighting bull. 'Veneno is the name of one of the strongest and most aggressive fighting bulls ever. He is also famous to be one of the fastest bulls in the history of bullfight. His name became popular in 1914, when he gored do death José Sánchez Rodríguez during the bullfight in the arena Sanlúcar de Barrameda's.'

Racing prototype: Lamborghini has described the 'extremely exclusive' Veneno as 'a racing prototype and road-going super sports car' based on the Lamborghini Aventador . To boost aerodynamic flow, the side line of the Veneno is therefore dominated by enormous sills and mighty wheel arches front and rear. A spokesman said: 'The Lamborghini Veneno brings the aerodynamic efficiency of a racing prototype to the road. Every detail of its form pursues a clear function – exceptional dynamics, optimum downforce with minimal drag and perfect cooling of the high-performance engine. 'The entire front end of the Lamborghini Veneno has been laid out for perfect airflow and downforce. The front end works as a large aerodynamic wing.' It has 20 inch alloy wheels at the front . and 21 inches at the rear.

Rare: The fourth car, called 'number 0' and created as a test vehicle for the other three, is the only one being shown at Geneva . The Veneno is painted in an all-new, grey metallic-look colour with individual parts highlighed in black in the exposed and visible carbon-fibre structure. The three cars sold to customers compose a trilogy in green, white and red accents, each of one featuring a single color of the Italian national flag, thus representing a unique piece: ‘The trilogy of three unique vehicles will be produced in the course of the year 2013 and handed over to their future owners.’ A fourth car called 'number 0' and created as a test vehicle for the other three is the only one being shown at Geneva and will also be the only Veneno displaying all three colours of the Italian flag.Lamborghini said: 'Its future has not been determined yet, but it will allow Lamborghini to continue its activity of testing and innovation, both on the road and on the race track.' Quick: To boost aerodynamic flow, the side line of the Veneno is dominated by enormous sills and mighty wheel arches front and rear . All exterior parts are made from carbon fibre which also dominates the interior with an exposed central tunnel and sills. Two lightweight bucket seats are made from Lamborghini’s patented composite. A specially woven carbon-fibre skin is used to clad the entire cockpit, part of the seats and the headliner.

In an angry outburst, Andrew Rodgers, 34, accused women of ‘draining resources’ by going on maternity leave, it is claimed. The hairdresser is said to have justified his threat by saying gay people were less likely than straight people to have children. Tribunal: Former salon manager Natasha Bramhall, 26, is claiming sex discrimination and unfair dismissal against Andrew Rodgers's business which operates three hair salons in Sheffield and employs 28 people . He allegedly added that he made an . exception for fat heterosexual people – because ‘no one would want to . have a baby with a fat person’. The comments were reported in a sex discrimination hearing in which Mr Rodgers was branded a sexist bully by former employees. Salon manager Natasha Bramhall, 26, says she was bullied out of her job after having her son, Alfie. Colleagues queued to support her at Sheffield employment tribunal. Mr Rodgers, who is gay, allegedly . resented employing women at his Funky Divas salon chain, which has three . branches in Sheffield. Witnesses said he was ‘very sexist’ and picked on those who became pregnant because he did not want them to . take maternity leave. Building: Mr Rodgers, who runs a chain of salons called Funky Divas in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is accused of being a sexist bully by hairdressers who used to work for him . Nail technician Kirsty Diver, 32, said she was reprimanded for  taking time off to have a baby. She said: ‘He stated that in future . he will be employing only fat, gay and lesbian members of staff as  no . one would want to have a baby with a fat person and gays and  lesbians . would not need to be off for maternity or paternity leave.’ Tracey Everatt said that she quit because of her boss’s ‘poor’  attitude towards women. She said: ‘Andrew used to say “I’m sick of these women draining the resources, I am going to make their life hell”. ‘He wanted to sack someone when he found out they were pregnant. He didn’t want the hassle.’ Miss Bramhall, who claims  sex . discrimination and unfair  dismissal, said Mr Rodgers’s behaviour . changed dramatically after she told him she was pregnant in 2009. She said she was left to work alone in a run-down area and was not paid when she took time off for pre-natal appointments. She added that he branded her a ‘drama queen’ for raising concerns about down-and-outs in the salon. Miss Bramhall, of Darnall, . Sheffield, said she returned to work in March 2011 after six months’ maternity leave – but quit in  September after finding she had . effectively been demoted. The tribunal heard Mr Rodgers was a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ character who could erupt in anger. One stylist said she had a . miscarriage in the toilets while doing a client’s nails but was too . scared to tell him. Another said she went into early labour in a salon . after Mr Rodgers allowed her no breaks all day and just a cookie for . lunch. Mr Rodgers, of Ecclesfield, . Sheffield, denies all the claims.

Oscar Pistorius is back at the track for the first time since he killed his model girlfriend on Valentine's Day two months ago. The Olympian is pictured with his hands on his hips wearing his blades as he walks across a running track as his agent said his return to training was imminent. Pistorius, 26, is keen to begin training again - just weeks after he appeared weeping in court charged with the death of Reeva Steenkamp and despite facing a murder trial. Oscar Pistorius pictured on a running track for the first time since shooting of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . The Beeld newspaper showed a photo of the athlete on the running track - nearly three months after he shot his girlfriend dead . The Afrikaans-language Beeld newspaper printed the image of what it said was Pistorius on the front page of its Thursday edition. In the photograph, the double amputee is seen from some distance wearing his blades and dark lycra running clothes and is walking on a track with his hands on his hips. The newspaper said the photo was taken on March 24 by a high school student visiting the University of Pretoria, where Pistorius' regular practice facility is. It was the first time Pistorius had put his blades on since he shot dead Steenkamp in his home his agent, Peet van Zyl, said, but it was not a training session. Pistorius was only 'having a jog . around the track,' the agent said, as the newspaper claimed sources had . told it the Olympic 400-meter runner and Paralympic champion had begun . full training on March 21. Mr . Van Zyl disputed that and said neither he nor Ampie Louw, Pistorius' coach and the man who controls his training sessions, were present at . the track on the day the photograph was taken. Reeva Steenkamp, girlfriend of South Africa's Olympic sprint star Oscar Pistorius, was shot dead by the athlete on Valentine's Day . The single photo, a grainy image taken through a metal fence showing Pistorius walking on the far side of the track, was accompanied by a front-page story under the headlines 'Oscar is back on the track' and 'In training with other athletes.' But while Pistorius wasn't yet in a training routine, his return could be any day now, his agent said. 'He was just having a jog around his track on his own accord. He wasn't back at training,' Mr Van Zyl said. 'That picture was taken by a schoolkid on March 24. Myself, Oscar and . his coach had a meeting on Tuesday to discuss him getting him back to . training. 'Based on that he told us he would like to get back in training and we can now look at formulating his training schedule. 'He is finding it very difficult and . he is still coming to terms with the sad loss of Reeva. That is why it . will be better for him to be back at training. It will be great to get . him back to the track and get some routine. That's why we are taking it . day by day.' While a return to training might be . on the cards for Pistorius, who holds several IPC World Championship . titles over 200 metres, 400m and 4x400m, Van Zyl revealed there is . currently no plan regarding his competitive return, if he is invited to . compete. Pistorius appeared at the Magistrates Court in Pretoria and is set to face a murder trial - an accusation he strongly denies . The athlete, who claims he mistook his girlfriend for an intruder, is reportedly keen to begin training . 'We haven't even spoken to him or contemplated him running in a competition,' Van Zyl said. 'He has got to be able to train first . and be in some decent form as a world-class athlete before we would . allow him to run in a competition. 'If he trains well and his mindset is . right then by all means we will look at competitions and options. When . that will be we don't know. It could happen quickly or it could take a . year. 'But at the moment, there is no specific date when it comes to him returning to training. 'In the current state he is in he . might get up tomorrow and give the coach a phone call and say he might . want to train again. He then might not want to train for a few days. 'We are not going to force him. We are going to be guided by him.' Pistorius' family said: 'Oscar is not back on any official training programme. 'This may change . in future, but this will be a decision taken by Oscar, and Oscar alone. At this . point Oscar is still in an extremely traumatized state and has made it clear to . all of us that he is not able or willing to even contemplate this issue at this . stage. 'We can confirm that we did have a meeting with Oscar . yesterday where various family members and his trainer were present. 'We all . encouraged him to get back onto the track to help stabilise him emotionally. 'Oscar has been out running on a number of isolated occasions in the . days following the relaxation of his bail conditions, but each time has been . very difficult and he has ""struggled immensely"" with the decision to . even leave the house. 'As a family however we encourage him to start exercising as we believe . it is a vital step in helping him deal with the trauma.' Mr Van Zyl insisted Pistorius' desire to start training again did not show disrespect to the family of Steenkamp. 'I can't see there would be any people saying this is disrespectful. This is not disrespectful to Reeva or her family. 'This has been part of his life for . so many years. If it makes things easier for him to work through it and . get some sense back into his life, let him run and let him jog. 'He's a human being and that's maybe an outlet for him.' Pistorius denies murder in the Valentine's Day killing of model Steenkamp, saying he mistook her for a nighttime intruder in his home. His next scheduled court appearance is June 4, when prosecutors say they intend to serve indictments. The athlete is free to compete in Britain this summer after a judge relaxed his bail terms in March to allow him to make money. It is certain to prove controversial as  it potentially paves the way for Pistorius, one of the world’s most successful athletes, to earn vast sums of money while he  is awaiting trial. Although charged with murder, Pistorius has not been convicted of any crime and would be allowed to enter Britain by the Home Office.","Pictured on track at the University of Pretoria and is keen to start training .

Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Indonesia not to execute drug smuggling grandmother Lindsay Sandiford . Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged a court in Indonesia not to execute a British grandmother convicted of drug smuggling. A panel of judges in Bali is expected to rule this month on an appeal against the death penalty passed in January on Lindsay Sandiford from Cheltenham. Drugs mule Sandiford, 56, was caught smuggling cocaine worth £1.6 million in the lining of a suitcase from Bangkok to the island last year. She got a death sentence despite taking part in a sting after her arrest which resulted in the arrest and conviction of the smuggling plot’s alleged masterminds, who got lighter sentences. Now, in a forceful intervention, Mr Hague has sent a strongly-worded appeal to the three judges through the Foreign Office arguing Sandiford’s death penalty is 'unwarranted because it is an excessive punishment'. The 14-page submission, shown to the Mail on Sunday by a court insider, says the British government has 'serious concerns' over Sandiford’s case. 'The government requests that the court takes into account the violations of Mrs Sandiford’s fundamental rights and decide that in these circumstances the death penalty would not be appropriate,' it says. 'Allegations of mistreatment of Mrs Sandiford during the initial period in detention have been raised. This includes threats with a gun and sleep deprivation. 'The UK government also has serious concerns at the absence of immediate – and prolonged delay of – consular notification. This is all the more concerning given the absence of legal representation and a translator during the period of detention.' The document – known as an Amicus Brief  – says Sandiford’s death penalty should be reduced to a jail term and implies her execution would have diplomatic repercussions. 'Mrs Sandiford is a 56 year old woman. She has two sons and an infant grandchild who would plainly be seriously affected were Mrs Sandiford to be executed,' it says. Lindsay Sandiford was caught smuggling cocaine worth £1.6million in her suitcase from Thailand . 'Mrs Sandiford cooperated with the authorities with a view to detaining others who were involved in the drug trafficking. 'The High Court should take into account this cooperation, especially given that the others involved have now been convicted.' Briton Julian Ponder, 43, the plot’s . alleged mastermind, was sentenced to six years for possessing cocaine . after initial accusations of conspiracy to traffic drugs were reduced. His . partner Rachel Dougall, 38, got one year for failing to report a crime . while a third Briton, 40-year-old Paul Beales, jailed for four years for . possessing drugs. Sandiford . claims she only agreed to carry the cocaine because of death threats to . her son and says Ponder, Beale and Dougall organised her smuggling run . from Bangkok to Bali. British . embassy officials in Indonesia did not learn of Sandiford’s arrest for . nearly two weeks after her initial arrest as she cooperated in the . drawn-out police sting. 'The . (British) government wishes to draw the attention of the court to the . allegations of mistreatment by officials when Mrs Sandiford was first . detained,' says the document. Lindsay Sandiford, left, was convicted of drug-smuggling along with Briton Julian Ponder, right, the plot's alleged mastermind who was jailed for six years . 'This . mistreatment constituted violations of Mrs Sandiford’s fundamental . rights under international law and Indonesian constitutional law. 'Mrs . Sandiford was also not provided with a lawyer during the period of . interrogation and in addition concerns have been raised about the . adequacy of Mrs Sandiford’s legal representation during parts of the . trial process.' Criticising . the January sentence in the district court in the island capital . Denpasar, document argues: 'It is not apparent that the court took . account of these considerable mitigating factors when making its . decision. 'The fact . that the prosecution did not seek the death penalty gives weight to the . inappropriateness of the death sentence in Ms Sandiford’s case.' Sandiford will be executed by firing squad if her death penalty is upheld. She can, however, make a further appeal to Indonesia’s Supreme Court in Jakarta. She is on death row in the Bali’s notorious Kerobokan jail with Dougall, Ponder and Beale and claims to have been subjected to death threats for sneaking on them to police. Dougall, whose six year-old daughter with Ponder, Kitty, is being cared for by her parents in Brighton, is due to walk free in May after completing her one-year sentence. Foreign Office spokesman Jonathan Farr said the amicus brief was not signed personally by Hague but by a representative of the Foreign Office 'on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government'. He added: 'The amicus brief forms part of Lindsay Sandiford’s appeal against her death penalty sentence. 'It continues to be the longstanding policy of the United Kingdom to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances and we will do all we can assist British Nationals facing the death penalty.'","Foreign Secretary has sent strongly-worded appeal through Foreign Office .

Peter Sagan was widely criticised after being photographed grinning with his had on hostess Maja Leye's backside after coming second in the Tour of Flanders on Sunday. The 23-year-old apologised and insisted he meant it as a 'joke' - and many of his fellow Slovaks have come out in support of him. Controversy: Peter Sagan, left, pinched Maja Leye's bottom as she was kissing Fabian Cancellara on the podium after the Tour of Flanders in Oudenaarde, Belgium on Sunday . Support: Slovaks have been pictured pinching each others' behinds in homage to the controversial act . Polemic: The pictures are intended to signify that there was nothing wrong with Mr Sagan's actions . Dozens of web users have posted comic pictures of themselves pinching others' behinds in a homage to Mr Sagan's divisive actions. The controversy started after the race in Oudenaarde in Belgium, in which Mr Sagan, 23, was runner-up to Fabian Cancellara. The winner was pictured on the podium being kissed on the cheek by Ms Leye and another hostess. But the Slovakian cyclist drew attention to himself by reaching out and grabbing the bottom of the blonde woman. Elaborate: This comic picture posted online clearly took a lot of logistical effort to set up . Parody: Some Slovakian web users involved props such as cuddly toys to craft their supportive jokes . Backlash: They clearly though that Mr Sagan had done nothing wrong and was being unfairly criticised . Many commentators accused Mr Sagan of sexism - Jane Aubrey, editor of cyclingnews.com, tweeted: 'In the workplace, it's called harassment.' The online storm prompted the cyclist to issue an apology for his actions, saying he did not want to 'disrespect women' and adding: 'Just a joke, sorry if someone was disturbed about it.' He later posted a video on his website in which he said: 'I sincerely apologise to Maja for what I did on the podium yesterday after the race because it was wrong of me. I never should have done it. 'I am so sorry and I hope that Maja and anyone else I have offended knows how sorry I am and accept my apology. I promise to act more respectfully in the future.' Sexual harassment: The online jokers argue that Mr Sagan's bottom-pinching was meant to be light-hearted . Close-up: Another staged incident making fun of the controversy which flared up this week . Raunchy: Some of the submissions involved a certain amount of explicit content . However, many Slovaks apparently thought Mr Sagan had nothing to apologise for, with many making jokes which indicated they thought the incident was overblown. 'The hostess kissing the winner - a complete stranger - is a shocking case of harassment in the workplace,' journalist Tomas Teicher wrote on his blog. Nearly 5,000 people have joined a Facebook group urging members to pinch strangers' bottom in solidarity with the cyclist. They have posted lighthearted photographs of themselves pretending to 'harass' either friends or inanimate objects such as statues and even cuddly toys.","Peter Sagan, 23, pinched Maja Leye's bottom after race in Belgium .

The government has been ordered to pay compensation for the ‘injustice’ of inflicting misery on an elderly couple who were left without heating for three years by a bungled state-sponsored energy programme. Donald Siteman told a parliamentary watchdog his three-bedroom home had become a ‘hell house’, with his dying wife Evelyn forced to wear her coat indoors and go to bed early in a desperate attempt to get warm. A boiler installed under Labour’s £2.4billion Warm Front scheme broke down after just six months, beginning a tortuous battle to have it fixed which lasted through three bitterly cold winters. A damning report found both the Department for Energy and Climate Change and its contractor Carillion guilty of ‘maladministration’, accusing them of inflicting ‘distress and physical and material hardship’ on an ‘elderly and vulnerable’ couple. Donald and Evelyn Siteman signed up to the Warm Front scheme in 2009 to update their heating system, but endured three years of misery after it stopped working. Mrs Siteman died in October, having never seen the problem fixed . As a result of three years of excuses, . mistakes and unresolved complaints, Mr Siteman experienced ‘distress and . physical and material hardship’ which would have been ‘amplified . because he also had to watch his wife, who was unwell, also suffer’, the . Parliamentary Ombudsman said. Mrs Siteman, 85, died from tongue cancer in October. The inquiry was told that one of the last things she said to her husband while being treated in hospital was to ask if the heating problems had been fixed. The Ombudsman ordered DECC to pay Mr Siteman £1,000 in addition to a raft of remedial work at the property in Wembley, north London to put right the mess left by Carillion after installing the boiler in 2009. The contractor repeatedly refused to put the problem right, and only acted after a complaint was made to the Parliamentary Ombudsman about the dysfunctional Warm Front Scheme. Mr Siteman, who turned 90 on Saturday, told MailOnline that after three years without heating and the death of his wife he was forced to move out of his home altogether after during the unusually cold winter at the end of 2012. ‘It was grim’, he said. ‘I had electric heaters going but it didn’t make any difference. It was so cold it was unbelievable. I moved out and was staying with my daughter.’ DECC was severely criticised for its role in the ‘emotional and physical distress’ the couple suffered’. The ministry first learned of the . problems in October 2010, but it took two years before a remedy was . found and the house had already been without heating for a year. Labour MP Barry Gardiner, a former environment minister, said: ‘This was more than incompetence and maladministration. ‘It was a heartless refusal to help . an elderly couple whose home Carillion had wrecked under a government . scheme that was supposed to keep them safe and warm. ‘I am delighted that the Ombudsman has . now secured substantial compensation for Mr Siteman. The only tragedy . is that his wife passed away just before Christmas and did not survive . to see the Ombudsman’s report.’ The couple live in Mr Gardiner’s Brent . North constituency. The boiler was installed in 2009 but six months later it stopped working, leaving the Sitemans without heating for three years (file picture) Mr Siteman would often wear a coat in . the house and wore a dressing gown to bed, which had an electric blanket . and three further blankets on top. The couple would go to bed during the . day, not to sleep but to keep warm while running up electricity bills . using heaters to warm the kitchen – where they ‘effectively lived’ as . the only room they were able use comfortably. Getting dressed was ‘horrible’ and the experience reminded Mr Siteman of ‘wartime’, he told the Ombudsman. The devastating report said: ‘Mr . Siteman said that he would often wake up early, at 5am, to put the . electric heaters on so his wife could be warm when she got up. Mrs Siteman, . who was 85 at the time, would sit in the kitchen with her arms on the . radiator to try and get warm. ‘Throughout the time they did not have . heating, Mrs Siteman was very unwell. This turned out to be the symptoms of . the tongue cancer that she eventually died from. ‘Mr Siteman was distressed when . talking about his wife and the suffering she must have felt being unwell . and freezing cold on top of that. ‘He said that one of the last things . his wife said to him when she was ill in hospital before she died was to . ask him if the heating had been put in yet. ‘He said that she must have really suffered to still be thinking about the heating at that time.’ The . Ombudsman said it was clear that Carillion failed to carry out work to . meet Mr Siteman’s needs, and stopped working altogether within six . months of being installed. ‘The . purpose of Warm Front was to tackle fuel poverty by ensuring people . without working heating systems got working heating systems,’ the report . added, arguing both DECC and Carillion should have recognised that they . had failed to meet this basic objective. Mr Siteman was persuaded to sign up to . the scheme update the working heating system in the three-bedroom home . the couple had lived in since 1962. Carillion carried out a survey of the Sitemans’ home in February 2009, and a boiler was installed in July that year. But . in January 2010, Mr Siteman complained to Carillion that his house was . not warming up, including having problems with the water pressure and . thermostat. Some remedial work was carried out in February 2010, but . this made little difference. Labour MP Barry Gardiner condemned the 'heartless refusal' of the government to intervene earlier . Mr Siteman made a formal complaint in May 2010 about the suitability of the boiler and the fact it had been put in a place that he was not happy with. They promised to carry out a ‘power slush’ to remove sludge and debris from the pipework and radiators in August. In October that year he complained to the DECC, and they promised a power flush in November but the firm and ministry kept blaming the properties old pipework. It was not until March 2012 that Carillion finally admitted it had put the boiler 90 degrees from it should have been, and said the heating system no longer met Mr Siteman’s needs. They offered to replace the boiler in the position originally agreed and fit new radiators in the lounge, but Mr Siteman considered the offer to ‘inadequate’ and complained to the Ombudsman. As a result, Carillion upped its offer and has installed a better boiler, new radiators and underground pipes and is planning to make good the kitchen and redecorate and pay £1,500 in compensation. While the firm had now gone beyond what was required under guidance, these actions were only ‘reasonable, adequate and fair’ given the suffering the family experienced. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: 'The customer service provided on this occasion was unacceptable and we are writing to Mr Siteman directly to express our most sincere apologies that the service he received was far from the usual high standard. 'We have worked with Carillion, who run Warm Front, to ensure that Mr Siteman now has a suitable heating system installed in his home which he is happy with. 'Warm Front has helped around 2.3million vulnerable households since 2000. Overall customer satisfaction remains high for the scheme.' A Carillion spokesman said: ‘We acknowledge and accept the findings of this report and would apologise unreservedly for what has clearly been a difficult time. ‘The heating system is now fully operational and we are in contact with Mr Siteman to discuss additional measures as a goodwill gesture. ‘Warm Front assisted more than 2.3 million households in England during its existence, helping to make their homes warmer and more affordable to heat. On this occasion service levels clearly fell short of the high standards set.’","Government ordered to pay compensation to Donald Siteman, 90 for the misery inflicted by the catalogue of errors under the Warm Front scheme .

A father-of-three died on the bathroom floor of a hospital after a junior doctor left life-saving drugs off his medication chart, an inquest has heard. Medics failed to realise Edward McKean, 52, was not receiving vital blood-thinning drugs for six days after he underwent brain surgery to remove a benign tumour. Mr McKean did not receive the drugs - designed to reduce the risk of blood clots - because a junior doctor missed them off his treatment chart when she copied it up. As a result, a clot formed in Mr McKean’s leg, broke free, and blocked an artery, causing a fatal pulmonary embolism - a blood clot in the pulmonary artery - as he walked to the bathroom. A post-mortem examination found he had already suffered a smaller embolism which could have alerted doctors to their mistake and saved his life. A coroner ruled that doctors and nurses missed numerous opportunities to spot their mistake and said ‘neglect’ had been a contributing factor to his death. An inquest at Coventry Magistrates Court on Friday heard that the keen walker’s life could probably have been saved if the mistake had been picked up. Mr McKean had surgery to correct a rare tumour in his nasal cavity and skull at University Hospital Coventry, in Walsgrave, on April 3 last year. He initially received the anti-coagulant medication after the opeation but stopped receiving it following the error. The contracts manager, from Solihull, West Midlands, died as he walked to the bathroom on April 22, almost three weeks after his operation. Mr McKean’s partner, Susan Rickards, told the inquest she had ‘fought for a year’ to stop the tragedy being ‘swept under the carpet’. Describing the moment she learned of his death, she told the inquest: ‘The hospital rang me at five in the morning and told me there was an emergency, so I shot up there. ‘I thought if he saw I was calm it would help him to keep calm. ‘I thought he might have broken his arm or leg, but when I got to the ward they told me he was gone.’ Consultant neurosurgeon Hussien El-Maghraby admitted the mistake should have been detected sooner. He said: ‘What is serious is that it was not picked up for six days.’ Mr El-Maghraby added that when he learned what had happened, he sent an email to the hospital’s chief executive. A junior doctor at University Hospital Coventry missed vital blood-thinning drugs off Mr McKean's medication chart and as a result he went without them for six days and died of a blood clot in the pulmonary artery . Deputy coroner Louise Hunt asked him: ‘On a scale of one to ten, how serious would you say these collective failings were?’ He replied: ‘Very serious, ten out of ten. ‘That’s what made me send an email.’ The inquest heard the hospital had since improved ward rounds and made other changes to minimise the risk of a similar tragedy. Ruling that neglect had contributed to Mr McKean’s death, Ms Hunt asked the hospital to send her written confirmation that it had implemented measures to prevent similar mistakes occurring again. Dr Mike Iredale, deputy medical director, apologised to the family for the ‘unimaginable distress and grief’ the hospital had caused them. He accepted serious mistakes were made and promised the hospital would continue to improve its procedures.","Edward McKean, 52, had undergone surgery to remove benign brain tumour .

Scientists are planning to intentionally smash a spacecraft into a huge asteroid in 2022 to see inside the rock. The European-led Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission (AIDA) will launch in 2019. It will send two spacecraft — one built by US scientists and the other by the European Space Agency — on a three-year voyage to the asteroid Didymos at a cost of around £225million. The European-led Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission (AIDA) will launch in 2019. It will send two spacecraft on a three-year voyage to the asteroid Didymos . The asteroid has been selected for the mission because it has 'no chance of hitting the earth' making it perfect for this type of fact-finding missions. Speaking at the 44th annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, experts explained Didymos is actually a binary asteroid system. It consists of two separate space rocks - the largest measuring 2,625 feet (800 metres) across, and the smaller around 490 feet (150 m) - which are bound together by gravity. The AIDA Didymos mission will be carried out to give scientists a groundbreaking first look at a binary space rock system and hopefully reveal ways that dangerous asteroids which pose a possible risk to the earth can be deflected. The European Space Agency is building the second AIDA spacecraft - the Asteroid Impact Monitor (or AIM) - which will observe the impact and collect data to properly understand the impact . AIDA scientist have timed the 2022 mission to coincide with a 'close approach' by the Didymos asteroids -  meaning it will be about 6.8 million miles (11 million km) from the Earth,. Should Britain spend millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on space exploration? Andy Rivkins, of the Johns Hopkins' Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland is working on the U.S. arms of the AIDA project. He and his colleagues are building DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test), one of the two spacecraft  which will be involved in the mission. It will be launched into the smaller Didymos asteroid while travelling at 14,000 mph (22,530 km/h). The exact composition of the Didymos asteroids is not yet known, but scientists hope once the spacecraft impacts, they will be able to measure how much the asteroid's orbit is . affected and ascertain its surface composition. Rivkin told the Huffington Post it will create a crater during impact which will hopefully send the space rock off course - but just by a few millimetres. The European Space Agency is building the second AIDA spacecraft - the Asteroid Impact Monitor (or AIM) - which will observe the impact and collect data to properly understand the impact. If the mission is successful, it could help inform space agencies around the world how to deflect larger, more threatening asteroid that could pose a threat to Earth, Rivkin added. The AIDA mission's AIM space craft is expected to cost about £127m ($194 m), while the DART spacecraft is slated to cost about £98million, mission officials said.","Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission (AIDA) to launch 2019 .

Nine secret crypts have been uncovered under the ruins of Coventry's bombed cathedral by restoration workers. Two crypts had already been discovered in the former cemetery grounds of St Michael's Church when it was cleared to make way for the new cathedral building. But a further nine ancient graves have been revealed after maintenance work began when a crack appeared in part of the 14th Century ruins in September 2011. Discovery: Nine crypts have been uncovered underneath the ruins of St Michael's Church in Coventry which was reduced to rubble during World War Two . Ongoing project: Restorations workers made the discovery while conducting maintenance on the ruins which began after a crack appeared in September 2011 . It is believed the crypts may date back to the 1350s and were used as burial places for Coventry's nobility. Some contained human bones. Dr Jonathan Foyle, chief executive of the World Monuments Fund Britain, which is handling the work, described the find as significant. He told the BBC the discovering was like finding a 'subterranean wonderland'. Dr Foyle added he is hopeful that the crypts can be opened to the public after they have been cleared of rubble and checked for damp. Kept secret: It is believed the crypts date back to the 1350s when the original church was constructed . Destroyed: A new cathedral was built among the ruins of the first St Michael's Church which was almost completely destroyed by German bombs on November 14, 1940 . He said: 'It's where Coventry's medieval burial grounds were - and at that time it was the fourth greatest city in England in the 14th Century. 'These spaces would have been created to to provide a fitting burial for the many thousands of people who contributed to the rise of this city at its peak.' Campaigners are fundraising to restore more of the cathedral after more than £350,000 was spent on repairs to the cathedral ruins in 2010. The ruins were placed on the World Monuments Fund's Watch List, a catalogue of cultural heritage sites around the globe which are in danger, in October 2011 shortly after the crack appeared. St Michael's Church was largely constructed between the late 14th century and early 15th century.

Only the tower, spire, the outer wall and the bronze effigy and tomb of its first bishop, Huyshe Wolcott Yeatman-Biggs, survived the bombing blitz.

The ruins of this older cathedral remain hallowed ground and are listed at Grade I. The new St Michael's Cathedral was built alongside the ruins from a design by Basil Spence, whose plan was selected in a competition from over 200 entrants. Spence (later knighted for this work) insisted that instead of re-building the old cathedral it should be kept . in ruins as a garden of remembrance and that the new cathedral should . be built alongside, the two buildings together effectively forming one . church. The use of Hollington sandstone for the new Coventry . Cathedral provides an element of unity between the buildings. The foundation stone of the new cathedral was laid by the Queen in 1956, and building was finished in 1962.","Ancient graves uncovered by restoration workers at 14th Century cathedral .

"PUBLISHED: . 04:37 EST, 3 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:28 EST, 3 April 2013 . A £16 computer designed to help children learn how to write code has sold out across the US within hours. The Raspberry Pi, manufactured in Pencoed just outside Cardiff, has become a huge hit among both children and adults since in launched across Europe in February. The gadget went on sale on Monday in the . U.S. through retailer Allied Electronics, but the cheapest version, . costing just £16 (£25) is already out of stock. The Raspberry Pi model B low cost computer, which has sold out within hours in the US - and has already sold a million across Europe . The Raspberry Pi is a tiny no-frills computer that was designed to get children interesting in the nuts and bolts of computing. Costing just £16, it comes with a processor that uses the ARM architecture, a British technology that is particularly good for small, light battery-operated devices. The Raspberry Pi arrives without a case or any other peripherals: you have to add a keyboard and mouse, and plug it into a computer screen or your TV. You also have to load the operating system yourself. It can run a special version - or 'distro' - of Linux, the open-source operating system, called Raspbian. There's even a version of Google's Android for the Raspberry Pi. The A version of the computer, which . only costs £16 ($25), has 256MB of RAM, a single USB 2.0 socket, an HDMI, SD . card, and 3.5 audio sockets, but no Ethernet port. The £22 ($35) Raspberry Pi B has 512MB of RAM, two USB 2.0 sockets and an Ethernet port. The tiny gadget has already sold a million units in Europe, and its creators hope it will become a global hit. Co-founder Eben Upton, who says his . job is like getting paid to play with digital Lego all day, says the . Raspberry Pi Foundation initially planned a run of only 10,000 when it . was launched in 2009. 'The fact we have sold out in the US is very satisfying,' he told MailOnline. ‘We did not set this up to sell . computers, we set it up because we realised since the Eighties and . Nineties young people have fewer opportunities to learn to programme . computers,’ he said. The firm also recently moved production back to the UK. 'We are manufacturing in Pencoed, in Wales, at the . Sony UK Technology Centre, after we discovered we could build at the . same cost in the UK,' said Upton. 'We're building a few thousand a week of the cheaper version, . compared to tens of thousand of the more expensive model, but we may . change that now,' he said. 'It turns out people are very enthusiastic and demand has been satisfying high.' The co-founders had the idea after meeting at Cambridge University. The low-cost computer – available as a £16 or £22 model – plugs into a TV and has ports for a keyboard and mouse. 'The . idea behind a tiny and cheap computer for kids came in 2006, when Eben . Upton and his colleagues at the University of Cambridge’s Computer . Laboratory, including Rob Mullins, Jack Lang and Alan Mycroft, became . concerned about the year-on-year decline in the numbers and skills . levels of the A Level students applying to read Computer Science in each . academic year,' the firm says on its website. It has been hailed across the industry as a key way to attract students to programming. How the Raspberry Pi works . Earlier this year the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced more than 15,000 children in the UK will be given one of their iconic microcomputers for free, thanks to a donation from Google Giving. Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman, Google, said: 'Britain’s innovators and entrepreneurs have changed the world - the . telephone, television and computers were all invented here. 'We've been . working to encourage the next generation of computer scientists and we . hope this donation of Raspberry Pi’s to British school pupils will help . drive a new wave of innovation.' Despite technology being one of the world’s fastest growing industries, the teaching of computer science in schools has been in decline. Over the last decade, the number of people studying computer science in the UK dropped by 23% at undergraduate level, and by 34% at graduate level. This at a time when the UK needs more computer scientists than ever.","Credit card sized computer has already sold a million in Europe since being released in February .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:42 EST, 17 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:49 EST, 17 February 2013 . Famed actress Rita Moreno dedicated much of her new memoir to her lengthy affair with Marlon Brando, which continued for nearly a decade even though he had two different wives during that period. Moreno, known best for her role as Anita in West Side Story, met Brando on the set of his 1954 movie Desiree, when he was 30-years-old and far more experienced than she since she was just 22-years-old at the time. 'Just meeting him that first day sent my body temperature skyrocketing as though I had been dropped into a very hot bath, and I went into a full-body blush. It was the sort of rush that inspires poetry and songs,' she writes in her new memoir. Into lovers' eyes: Rita Moreno and Marlon Brando met when she was 22-years-old and he was 30, though they reunited for a film later in life after their romantic relationship ended (pictured in 1967) Star: Rita Moreno won many awards for her acting work, but much of her new memoir is dedicated to the ins- and outs- of her 8-year relationship with Brando . The New York Post reports that an early copy of the book, aptly titled 'Rita Moreno', she tells how their physical connection created a real emotional entanglement. 'To say that he was a great lover — . sensual, generous, delightfully inventive — would be gravely . understating what he did not only to my body, but for my soul. Every . aspect of being with Marlon was thrilling, because he was more engaged . in the world than anyone else I’d ever known,' she wrote. Their . intimacy did not lead to mutual respect, however, as she writes that . Brando cheated on her frequently in order to try to meet his . 'insatiable' sexual appetite. In . order to stand her ground, she would date other famous men in order to . make him jealous, including future Oscar-winner Dennis Hopper. She tells . a story about how a man that she didn't know made aggressive eyes at . her while his 'regal' wife sat beside him, only to later learn it was . then-Senator John F. Kennedy. Tempestuous: The lowest points of their relationship came when Brando 'forced' her to abort their child and she tried to kill herself . The paramour that drove Brando the most insane, however, was when she went on a number of dates with pop star Elvis. Little did he know that Elvis and his famous pelvic thrusts did not match up to the sexual chemistry that she had with Brando. 'My dates...nearly always concluded in a tender tussle on my living-room floor, with Elvis’ pelvis in that famous gyration straining against his taut trousers. I could feel him thrust against my clothed body, and expecting the next move...but it never came,' she said of the singer. No matter the emotional toll, she kept coming back to Brando. Earning her reputation: Moreno, who became a household name after starring as Anita in West Side Story, went on to be the first Hispanic actress to win an Oscar, a Grammy, a Tony and an Emmy . Lovers: Moreno was driven crazy when Brando (left) openly took other lovers while he was with her, so she did the same by going out on dates with stars like Elvis Presley (right) Two of the lowest points in their torrid affair came when he pressured- and paid for- her to have an abortion when she became pregnant with their child. Shortly after that, he flew away to film . Mutiny on the Bounty and she was left heart broken when he fell in love . with his new co-star. Keepsake: This sexy still of Moreno and Brando during their film The Night of the Following Day was found hanging above Brando's desk when he died . After he returned and he picked her back up, she was left alone in his house at one point and she took the chance to attempt an overdose on pills. 'I went to bed to die. This wasn’t a revenge suicide, but a consolation, an escape-from-pain death,' she said, crediting her survival to his assistant who found her and took her to the hospital to have her stomach pumped. A therapist told the lovers to keep away from each other for their own health and finally, they relented. Moreno went on to have a successful and made records for being the first Hispanic actress to have won an Oscar, Tony, Grammy and Emmy. She is still working today at the age of 81-years-old, most recently appearing in the television series Happily Divorced. Her romantic was also far more successful after she finished her affair with Brando, as she was set up with- and ended up marrying- a doctor named Lenny Gordon. 'We balance each other,' she told People Magazine in 1975, ten years after marrying Gordon. 'I am not exactly Mrs. Good Housekeeping, although I love to cook, bake, even iron, but only because it's not mandatory.' Lasting career: Moreno won an Academy Award in 1962 (left) and at the current age of 81-years-old, she still has an active acting career (pictured at right in 2002) Looking back on the suicide attempt, the prospect of ending her life as there was so much left to come- including her daughter Fernanda- leaves her filled with regret. 'The thought that I may never have lived to see that beautiful creature Nandy just tears at me sometimes. But not for long. I can't dwell on past mistakes,' she told the magazine.","Rita Moreno had an affair with Marlon Brando for eight years .

Families who dodged the rain for long enough to take a swim in the sea last summer were more likely to catch a bug and fall sick. More than one in 20 popular beaches failed to meet even the minimum water quality standards set by the EU, according to research published today. The list of 42 failures, which is 17 more than last year, includes several beaches at some of the UK’s most famous resorts such as Blackpool and Rhyl. No good: Popular seaside holiday destination Blackpool in Lancashire was among the beaches who failed . EU rules mean that if these beaches are not cleaned up they will be required to put up danger signs, warning people not to swim, from 2016 onwards. Household water bills have soared in recent decades to raise billions of pounds to treat and clean-up sewage released into rivers and the sea. However, relentless rain and flooding during the wettest summer in 100 years led to an increase in the amount of bacteria and viruses ending up in bathing waters. This type of pollution can originate from farmland and urban run-off, storm waters, misconnected plumbing, septic tanks and dog faeces. Health risk: Several British beaches, including Rhyl in North Wales, did not meet the minimum water quality standard set by the EU . Danger: Summerleaze Beach at Bude on the Cornish coast was not judged clean and safe by the Marine Conservation Society . Bad business: For holiday destinations such as East Looe at the south Cornish resort of Looe, the water quality failures may lower visitors numbers further this summer .

The number with excellent water quality fell by 113 to 403. The remaining 351 failed to achieve the highest rating with 42 missing even the minimum safe standard. Among the high profile failures were some of the beaches in Blackpool, Rhyl, Bude, Bridlington, Lyme Regis, Exmouth, Seaham, and Kimmeridge Bay, in Dorset. The findings are a blow to the resorts, which are already struggling because of a cost of living squeeze that means many people are staying at home. However, not all is lost, for the same study was generally able to identify beaches within a short distance that were clean and safe. Underperformed: The 42 failing EU beaches included several in the UK, such as Lyme Regis beach in Dorset . The failing beaches were spread across Britain, going as far north as Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire, Scotland . MCS Coastal Pollution Officer, Rachel Wyatt, called for improved monitoring of sewer overflows and urgent action to reduce pollution from farms and populated areas. ‘We have recommended fewer beaches in every English region and in Wales and Scotland. In England, the north west and south west were hit particularly hard, with the fewest number of recommended beaches for at least a decade. ‘Action must be taken now. With stricter bathing water standards from 2015 and summers that appear to be getting wetter, the iconic image of people bathing off golden beaches could be at serious risk.’","More than one in 20 beaches fail to meet minimum water quality standards .

Minister Kristin Halvorsen says schools . have the right to change dates for midterms exams and that the ministry . does not intend to intervene. The popstar has been through more than his fair share of controversy in recent weeks after being late for concert appearances, taking a pet monkey on a flight and notoriously attacking a photographer during his stint in London. But Justin Bieber has found himself at the centre of yet more trouble after reportedly being banned from one of Vienna's biggest nightclubs amid allegations of violent behaviour from members of his entourage. According to the Austrian Times, bodyguards smashed the cameras of fans who were enjoying themselves in Passage nightclub over the weekend, and even destroyed mobile phones in the midst of the furore surrounding the 19-year-old singer after her performed his Believe world tour in the Austrian city. Club manager Joachim Bankel told the newspaper: 'Justin Bieber is no longer welcome here.' Representatives for Justin Bieber declined to comment on the alleged incident when approached by MailOnline. This is not the only time the teen idol has been banned from an exclusive nightclub, with the Boyfriend hitmaker claiming he had the 'worst birthday ever' after he was turned away from London's Cirque Du Soir when he arrived at the venue with underage friends in tow. In February, he was snubbed by Manchester nightclub Sankeys as they didn't want him to tarnish their edgy image. Sankeys posted on Twitter at the time: 'Yes the rumours are true, we turned Justin Bieber away. He shuffles on stage and we can’t be having that in Sankeys now can we!’ To add to his woes, Justin is now facing criminal charges after for allegedly spitting on and threatening his neighbour after a fellow resident at his posh Calabasas gated community confronted him for driving recklessly on their private roads. It has already been a difficult year already for the teen star after dumped by his fellow popstrel and movie actress Selena Gomez, following a string of allegations he had been unfaithful. Meanwhile, he has been late for concert dates, and was taken to hospital in London after collapsing during his run of concerts in the English capital. Perhaps the most noteworthy incident was when he had to be held back by his own minders when he tried to get into a fistfight with photographers outside his London hotel last month. The young star provoked more speculation over his state of mind when he took a monkey on a flight with him from LA to Munich last week, which was then seized by customs.","The Canadian pop star is scheduled to perform in Oslo on April 16 and 17 .

A prolific criminal, who broke into a house to steal onion bhajis from the kitchen, was caught after he was found asleep in the garden. John Stalker, 59, from Workington, Cumbria, who has been found guilty of burglary, also stole apple juice and a slice of birthday cake from the home of Marie Mulla, last October. The owner had gone out for the evening with her 16-year-old daughter. Prolific criminal John Stalker, 59, was found guilty of breaking into a house and stealing food from the kitchen at Carlisle Crown Court . After taking the food, Stalker went outside the house in Silloth, Cumbria and fell asleep in a garden chair, where he was later found by Mrs Mulla's son, Lewis. The 18-year-old had noticed food was missing from the fridge and while the birthday cake and apple juice were found beside Stalker, there was no sign of the onion bhajis. Stalker, who is a prolific petty criminal with 98 previous convictions, pleaded guilty to burglary and was jailed for 81 days. Because of the time he has already spent in prison on remand, he will be released almost immediately. Carlisle Crown Court heard the break-in happened on the morning of October 2, after Stalker had been on a night out. After he was abandoned in Carlisle by the two men he had been with, Stalker hitchhiked as far as Abbeytown before walking through the night - and the rain - to Silloth. Following the break-in, Stalker stole the food items before falling asleep in the garden chair and wrapped himself in a canvas canopy. But Stalker was soon discovered by the teenager when he looked outside and saw the intruder asleep. He managed to wake him 'with some difficulty'. Stalker then threatened to kill the youth if he dared follow him over the hedge through which he escaped. Stalker was arrested five hours later in the nearby village of Blitterlees. The court heard Mrs Mulla now feels unsettled and insecure in her own home, and is plagued by thoughts of what might have happened if her son had confronted Stalker inside the house. In mitigation defence advocate Mark Shepherd - who described it as 'the most unsophisticated burglary imaginable' - said Stalker had been so exhausted after his long walk that the police who arrested him had sent him to hospital, because they were so worried about him. His 'sheer exhaustion' meant he could not remember going into the Mullas' house, he said. 'He has no recollection of it, but having been presented with the evidence he accepts he did it,' he said. Passing sentence, Judge Robert Brown told Stalker he shared Mrs Mulla's worries about what might have happened if her son had confronted him inside the house. He said: 'One is left wondering how you would have reacted had Lewis come downstairs at the time you were in the kitchen. 'In view of the threats you made to him when out in the garden, It is at least possible that there might have been a physical altercation.'","John Stalker, 59, found guilty of breaking into house and stealing food .

Award-winning Hollywood director James Cameron has received critical acclaim for his numerous hit films including Avatar, Titanic and Aliens. But the multi-talented director is also a passionate deep sea explorer who last year became the first person to descend to the deepest place in the ocean alone. He is now donating the submarine - called the Deepsea Challenger - he used for the trip to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in America for scientific research. Scroll down to watch the video . Cameron's dive took him to a part of the ocean no one has visited for 50 years - and he is the only human being to have travelled and returned solo . Gift: James Cameron pictured emerging from the hatch of Deepsea Challenger which he has now donated to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in America . Cameron became the first to descend the 10.9km - almost seven miles - down into the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, for . 50 years - and the only person to have ever done it alone. But he is now donating the submarine he used to achieve the incredible feat as he says cuts to funding for deep sea exploration is jeopardising research. The submarine parts will be used as add-ons for other vessels but the Deepsea Challenger could dive again in the future. Cameron told the BBC: 'I'd love to keep the . Deepsea Challenger continuously operational. But I think that what I'm . going for right now is what I call ""potentially operational"". 'My hope is with the sub's home now at . Woods Hole, there will be a residential team in place - and they will . have the knowledge of how to bring that sub back online.' Explorer: The Deepsea Challenger, pictured being tested off the coast of Papua New Guinea, descended 35,756 feet to the Pacific Ocean seafloor . Record-breaking: Cameron became the first to descend almost seven miles down into the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean for 50 years . And if it does come back in service, Cameron will the first queuing up to get behind the controls. He added: 'I'd like to go dive the sub again. There are a number of really, really . interesting science targets out there. I would love to see the Deepsea . Challenger dive in the Tonga Trench, the Kermadec Trench and the Sirena . Deep (a 10.7km-deep part of the Mariana Trench).' When Cameron travelled to the Mariana Trench, it took him two hours to reach the seafloor. He then spent several . hours exploring the seafloor while 3D cameras captured images for a National . Geographic film being released later this year. Speaking after the dive, Cameron said he had hoped to see some strange deep sea monster like a creature that would excite the storyteller in him and seem like out of his movies, but he didn't. All he saw were voracious shrimp-like critters that weren't bigger than an inch. Cameron was the first person to ever make the descent alone and spent several hours exploring the sea floor . Protection: Cameron commanded the sub from a spherical cockpit - the best shape for withstanding pressure . He said: 'It was bleak. It looked like the moon. I didn’t see a fish. I didn’t see anything that looked alive to me, other than a few shrimplike amphipods in the water.' The only previous manned dive to the Trench was carried out by US Navy Lt Don Walsh and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard in a bathyscaphe called Trieste in 1960. A series of dives - including Cameron's - in the last year have helped discover several new species. The director told BBC News: 'As an absolute minimum, (there were ) over 68 new species - most are bacteria, some are amphipods, and there is possibly a new sea cucumber... and that number may go way up. 'There were also some quite interesting new species of giant amphipods that were 7-8in long when amphipods are normally 0.5-1in in size.'

Labour's failed system of financial regulation that is blamed for Britain’s economic crisis is swept away today. Chancellor George Osborne and the outgoing head of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, will hail the abolition of the Financial Services Authority, the watchdog set up by Gordon Brown in 1997. The Bank is once again taking sole charge of regulating lenders and protecting and enhancing financial stability. Chancellor George Osborne, right, and outgoing head of the Bank of England Sir Mervyn King, left, will hail the abolition of the Financial Services Authority, which was set up by Gordon Brown . The FSA was set up as part of Mr Brown’s so-called ‘tripartite structure’, which meant banks, insurers, building societies and other such firms were regulated by the FSA, the Treasury and the Bank of England. But the watchdog failed to prevent a lending boom or risky trading by banks, which ended in a spectacular crash that saw Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB collapse and need massive taxpayer bailouts. The FSA is being replaced with two successor organisations: the Prudential Regulation Authority, which will ensure the stability of financial services firms and be part of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority, which will act as the City’s behavioural watchdog. The Bank’s financial policy committee, meanwhile, is responsible for protecting and enhancing financial stability. In a speech today, Mr Osborne is due . to say: ‘The changes coming into effect today are the start of resetting . the system of financial regulation in our country.

'They do away with the discredited . system that failed to sound the alarm as the financial system went . wrong, and put in its place a new system that puts the Bank of England . back in charge and that will help ensure a strong, safe and successful . financial system in Britain.’ Mr Osborne announced the proposed changes soon after the coalition was formed in 2010, insisting clarity was needed over who was responsible for supervising the financial services sector and avoid a recurrence of failing banks and vast taxpayer bailouts. The moves are part of a big increase in the powers of the Bank of England and its new governor, Mark Carney, who takes charge in July. Together they represent the biggest changes to the central bank since it was given its independence in 1997. The PRA is to be led by the Bank’s deputy governor Andrew Bailey, and will regulate around 1,700 financial firms.

But for one set of parents and their two children, it proved the route to disaster. But the overweight Robinson family have managed to beat the bulge and have shed an astonishing 23 stone between them. Nicola Robinson, 47, was spurred into action when she begun to have trouble breathing because of her weight. Super slimmers: The Robinson family have lost a staggering 23 stone between them . Galvanised into action, she was joined by her equally overweight family - all of whom have dropped an impressive number of pounds. She managed to lose eight stone, her son Luke, 25, has shed over nine stone, her daughter Sally, 14, has lost nearly four stone, and her husband Stephen, 49, has lost nearly three stone. Nicola, an educational skills tutor, said: 'It is hard to believe that we have lost so much weight between us. We all feel so much better for it, we feel like a different family. We have lost 23 stone between us, in just a year.' The family piled on weight after eating four takeaways a week. They would binge on curries, Chinese food, pizza and kebabs, and would snack on chocolate and family sized bags of crisps. Before changing their diets, Nicola weighed a massive 23st 2lbs, Luke 23st 6 lbs, Stephen 17st 2lbs and Sally 16st 2lbs. Nicola was so overweight that it was caused her to stop breathing as many as 20 times each night. She said: 'It was frightening. I had to be hooked up to a machine each night to keep my airways open and stop them collapsing. 'I went to see the doctor and he told me that if I didn’t lose weight it would shorten my life by 40 per cent. It terrified me. I needed to be around to help my children grow up. 'When the doctor told me that, it felt like my whole world had collapsed around me. It was a frightening thing to hear - it was like I had been given a death sentence. I knew that I had to do something about it whilst I still could.' Healthy: According to mum, Nicola, cutting out the junk food has made a huge difference to their wellbeing . Parents: Before losing weight, Nicola (left) was having trouble breathing and was terrified of dying young . Nicola was referred for a gastric bypass operation, but before the operation could go ahead, she needed to lose some weight herself. So she decided to join Slimming World in January last year and go on a diet. Her son Luke came with her as he wanted to be healthy enough to join the police force. And daughter Sally came along two weeks later as she was getting bullied at school because of her weight. Nicola said: 'We all had our problems with our weight. It was getting us down as a family. I couldn’t move more than a few feet without getting out of breath and I was risking my life each time I went to bed at night. 'Luke was desperate to join the police force, but at 23st, he was far too fat to do that. And Sally was getting bullied at school because of her weight which was heartbreaking. 'As a mum I really wanted to help her, so I knew that it would be a good idea if we could all lose the weight together.' So the family ditched the takeaways and instead had cereal for breakfast, pasta for lunch and home made curry for dinner. They snacked on fruit and yoghurt. Nicola said: 'It was surprisingly easy. Our favourite meal was a mushy pea curry which was a Slimming World receipe. It tasted fantastic and we didn’t miss our takeaways at all. 'We still managed to go to McDonalds for the occasional treat, but we’d all have small portions of fries, instead of the large ones.' Thwarted: Son Luke was too fat to realise his ambition of becoming a policeman while Sally was being bullied . Nicola managed to lose four stone and was allowed to have her gastric bypass operation in July. She has since lost a total of 8st 1lb, and has gone from a dress size 30 to a much slimmer size 16. She said: 'I wanted to make sure I would never put the weight back on again, and I thought that was the best way I could guarantee that. It is a big operation, but my life was at stake and I wanted to live as long as possible to see my children grow up. 'I feel like a different person now. I don’t have to be hooked up to the machine at night and I don’t stop breathing anymore. Even my feet have shrunk two sizes, from a size seven to a size five. And my ring size has dropped too. 'Luke can achieve his dream of now being in the police force - his waist has gone from a size 52 inches to 36.  And Sally isn’t getting bullied at school anymore. She wore a skirt to school for the first time in September instead of trousers and I was so proud of her. 'Stephen joined in with the diet too and he has managed to lose nearly three stone too, so he feels much healthier too. We feel like a completely different family.'","At 23st 2lb, Nicola Robinson was at risk of dying early .

But this Easter there will be  rather a lot of lamb joints studded with anchovies at the family dinner table. The meal has been given a distinctive, fishy twist by chef Heston Blumenthal, triggering a rush for supplies of the tiny salty fish which have previously catered to a niche market. Fishy lamb: Heston Blumenthal with his unlikely but winning combination of lamb studded with anchovies . Sales of anchovies have soared five-fold after the recipe, which Blumenthal first saw as a child, was the focus of an advertising campaign for Waitrose. John Vine, grocery buyer for the chain, said: 'Sales are up 400 per cent week-on-week. The lamb is studded with anchovies to bring out the very best in the meat.' The sales boom revives memories of the 'Delia Smith effect' when the former Waitrose figurehead pushed up demand by using unlikely or obscure ingredients. In the advert, Blumenthal, depicted as  a ginger-haired teenager, is transfixed by a sizzling pan of lamb in a restaurant in France. The narrator promises viewers that 'the little tiddlers enhance the flavour' by melting away in the oven to leave a delicate tang. Fresh take: The new lamb recipe includes garlic, anchovies and, more conventionally, rosemary . Experimental: Heston Blumenthal has become the leading chef on the British cooking scene for cutting-edge recipes and novel food combinations . But . looking past the Blumenthal craze, the anchovy has quietly been . making the transition from foodie crowds to the family for some time. Anchovies it seems are the perfect accompaniment for frugal times, even the word in Italian describes a skinny person. Appearing on pizzas, pastas and salads, for some its appearance in the traditional roast was only the next logical step. The tinned fish has long been blended with meat in Mediterranean . cooking. British chefs such as Nigel Slater and Nigella Lawson have . long advocated their inclusion everything from meatballs to meat stew. Blumenthal’s version involves tucking them into the skin of the browned lamb along with garlic and a sprig of rosemary. The . whole thing is then roasted and the fish melts away leaving a delicate . salty tang and without any fishiness Blumenthal insists. He says: ‘The combination may sound odd but it really works. The savouriness of the anchovies brings out the best in the meat, without tasting overly fishy.’ Traditional: The roast lamb at Heston Blumenthal's Michelin-starred The Fat Duck restaurant .

A graffiti artist has paid tribute to a two-year-old boy who died from a rare form of cancer by spray painting the toddler's face onto a 30ft memorial wall. Scott Vincent spent two days painting the skate park mural in honour of little Leon Bartholomew, who lost a six month battle against the disease. It shows the cartoon-mad youngster with Mickey Mouse ears and has been described as a 'shrine' by his grieving father Daniel, 25. Family and friends have flocked to the wall in his hometown of New Milton, Hampshire, to lay flowers, light candles and add messages. Leon was diagnosed with undifferentiated sarcoma, which caused tumours to form his lungs and brain. Mr Bartholomew was touched when Mr Vincent travelled from his home in Brighton, East Sussex, to commemorate Leon's life. He described the finished work as a 'perfect picture' of his son. The former warehouse worker, who had to quit his job when Leon fell ill, said: 'The whole family was warmed when we saw the wall for the first time. 'We were all devastated when Leon passed away after battling a rare form of cancer for six months. 'But the wall is the a great way to remember our son and people have treated it with respect - it's just like a shrine.'

The Pope discussed the ‘pressures of office’ during private meetings with  Dr Rowan Williams last year and gave the impression that he might step down, the former Archbishop of Canterbury has revealed. Many of Benedict XVI’s aides described last week’s announcement that he would retire later this month as a ‘bolt from the blue’, but Dr Williams said it did not come as a total surprise to him. During their conversations, the 85-year-old pontiff acknowledged his ‘frailty’, Dr Williams said. He added that he thought then the Pope ‘was beginning to ask, “Is it possible to carry on with a good conscience?” ’ Rapport: Dr Rowan Williams, pictured with the pontiff in 2010, said Benedict XVI had acknowledged his 'frailty' during their meetings . Interviewed by Vatican Radio, the former Archbishop said he was sure the Pope had been wrestling with the dilemma of whether to resign or ‘soldier on to the end’ like his predecessor Pope John Paul II, who publicly battled with illness until his death in 2005. The disclosure is fresh evidence that the Pope had been considering his future for many months as he struggled with the so-called Vatileaks scandal – the leaking by his butler of stolen documents that exposed corruption in the Vatican. Insiders believe a secret report into the affair – that made clear the extent of feuding among cardinals – could have been the clinching factor in convincing the Pope that he no longer had the energy to impose his will. Private meetings between Dr Williams and the Pope, who built up a firm rapport as they battled various crises in their respective churches, took place in Rome in March and October last year. 'Dilemma': The former Archbishop of Canterbury said he was sure the Pope had been wrestling with whether to 'soldier on to the end' like his predecessor John Paul II . Dr Williams said he and the Pope had discussed his own decision to step down as Archbishop eight years earlier than he was required to, adding that ‘we shared some reflections on the pressures of office and, yes, we spoke about the promise to do a bit more thinking  and a bit more praying’. One priest involved in  Dr Williams’s visits added: ‘There was certainly an air of weariness from the Pope.’ Senior Church sources have revealed that the Pope’s ‘seismic’ decision to become the first pontiff for nearly 600 years to resign has angered key Vatican figures, who fear it will ultimately undermine the papacy. One cardinal said there  was ‘no doubt’ that some within the Vatican were  upset by the decision. He added while many senior clergy supported Benedict’s right to leave office, others feared the post would be diminished and his successors would be plagued by groups demanding  their resignations.","Pope described 'pressures of office' to former Archbishop of Canterbury .

Some frustrated passengers said they had been held on a plane for six hours waiting to take off, before being told their flight had been cancelled and that they had to disembark.

But rival Gatwick, just 24 miles away, kept its runway open and said the 50 cancellations it had made were all due to disruption at other airports. It said it had boosted its snow-clearing capabilities by studying methods used at Scandinavian airports such as Oslo.

Any passengers experiencing delays and cancellations will not be impressed when they see other airports operating more effectively.’ Hannah Furnish, 30, a nurse from Ashtead, Surrey, was dismayed when her flight to Geneva was cancelled yesterday. She said: ‘Other airports across Europe have coped and Gatwick has shown how it should be done. Heathrow has been nothing short of incompetent.’ Confusion: Critics said Heathrow bosses had failed to learn lessons from December 2010, when a snowstorm left the airport paralysed for days . Frustration: A British Airways worker clears away snow on a stand at at Heathrow Airport, which became a 'refugee camp' yesterday after hundreds of flights were cancelled leaving passengers stranded . Ongoing delays: Staff battled in vain to minimise disruption at the airport, where a fifth of flights are expected to be cancelled today as the wintry weather persists . A total of £36 million has been spent upgrading Heathrow’s winter weather equipment over the past two years, more than doubling the number of snow-clearing vehicles to 130. But it still had to shut its northern runway for more than an hour on Friday morning so snowploughs could clear it of snow and ice. Sinking feeling: The departures board at the airport indicates a string of cancellations . Soon after the runway was back in operation, the airport’s second runway was also closed for an hour for snow clearance. Air traffic controllers extended the length of time between flights because of poor visibility and British Airways suffered severe delays in de-icing its aeroplanes’ engines as they sat on the Tarmac awaiting take-off. Gatwick, which was also forced to ground thousands of planes in 2010, said its management had spent £8 million doubling its ‘snow kit’. The airport was operating as normal yesterday. LHR Airports admitted that the closure of its runways at Heathrow had caused ‘a lot of disruption’ but said it would be unfair to compare the airport with Gatwick because it had to deal with a greater number of aircraft and was operating at full capacity. A spokesman added that Heathrow had a much larger area to clear. He said: ‘It is completely different here.’ British Airways passengers at Heathrow complained that although the airline was offering them free hotel vouchers, they had been told hotels were fully booked, so they had to either find their own accommodation and claim back the cost, or sleep on the floor. Sleeping mats, blankets and water were given to people stranded inside Terminal 5. A spokesman for BA said it had to make about 30 cancellations yesterday, mainly because aircraft and crew were out of position. But he said passengers on BA flights who no longer wished to travel this weekend could rebook their flight for a later date.","Stranded passengers were forced to sleep on terminal floors after severe weather saw hundreds of flights cancelled at Heathrow Airport .

"PUBLISHED: . 06:39 EST, 28 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:12 EST, 28 March 2013 . Lingerie giant Victoria's Secret has come under fire for 'sexualising' young girls with its latest underwear range which features thongs with the slogans 'call me' and 'I dare you' written across them. Outraged parents have accused the group of portraying young teenage girls 'as sex objects' with the provocative designs. The company insisted the collection was aimed at 'over 17s' but even its chief finance officer has suggested 15-year-old girls could wear the clothing range. Scroll down for video . Suitable for a schoolgirl: The company's chief finance officer Stuart Burgdoefer has suggested girls aged 15 could wear the range - which includes this 'I dare you' thong . Too sexy for teens? Victoria's Secret's Bright Young Things campaign for its PINK collection has sparked anger from parents who claim it is targeting younger children . Speaking at a conference to publicise . the Pink collection, Stuart Burgdoerfer reportedly said: 'When . somebody’s 15 or 16 years old, what do they want to be? They want to be . older, and they want to be cool like the girl in college, and that’s . part of the magic of what we do at Pink.' This is despite Victoria's Secret . claiming it released the line to coincide with America's college . student's spring break - gearing it towards 17 and 18-year-olds. Parenting website Netmums said Mr Burgdoefer's statement will astonish parents. Siobhan Freegard, from Netmums.com, said: 'Victoria's Secret is a brand built on selling sex. From the world famous raunchy fashion shows to neon bright colours and the skimpiest designs on the high street, the company has always promoted its products as overtly sexual. 'So for a top boss to claim the new teens range is designed to make underage girls look and feel older is a major marketing mistake which will horrify parents. 'There is enough pressure on young girls to grow up far too fast without clothing firms telling them they have to look like sexy adults while they are still in school. I wonder if the firm's bosses would be comfortable with their own child wearing this?' The provocative new line - advertised . under the motto Bright Young Things - has appalled parents who claim . the company is 'sexualising' their daughters. Inappropriate: Mr Burgdoefer claimed the range's 'magic' was helping 15-year-olds to feel older with its designs, such as this pink and orange thong with the slogan 'call me' On the wild side: Angry parents claims the range and 'Bright Young Things' advertising campaign portrays teens as sexual objects . Many took to the company’s Facebook . page to express their anger at the firm which uses top models Miranda . Kerr and Candice Swanepoel in its advertising campaigns. There is even a petition demanding . that the advertising campaign be withdrawn and that the Bright Young . Things line not target teenagers at all. In a letter on ForceChange.org to . Victoria's Secret CEO Lori Greeley, it is accused of hiring 'younger . looking teen models who are scantily clad and provocatively posed'. It also objects to the slogan 'Bright Young Things' because it 'refers to young women as ""things.""' It read: 'By choosing to target . teenagers with your new line, you are condoning teen sexuality and . portraying teens as sexual objects.' Victoria's Secret responded to the . complaints with a statement on its Facebook page, insisting that it has . no plans to launch a line for girls not old enough to attend college. 'In response to questions we recently . received, Victoria’s Secret PINK is a brand for college-aged women,' it . read. 'Despite recent rumors, we have no plans to introduce a . collection for younger women. '""Bright Young Things"" was a slogan used in conjunction with the college spring break tradition.' Promotional opportunity: The Bright Young Things campaign was launched to tie in with Spring Break . Despite the company's assurances, hundreds of parents are threatening to boycott the chain. One commenter wrote: 'You are selling . out a generation of young women to make a buck with your ""Bright Young . Things"" line. It is irresponsible and disgusting to market that level of . sexually suggestive items to girls. As an adult, I will no longer be . shopping in your store.' Another wrote: 'You already do enough . to undermine real woman's and young ladies self esteem - now you want . further sexualize our daughters [sic].' And one women admitted to being a longtime fan of the brand, yet refuses to shop there any longer. 'I have shopped regularly at . Victoria's Secret for a decade and will no longer be supporting your . business,' she wrote. 'It's a shame because I love your product, but I . cannot support a company that seeks to sexualize children.' But not everyone is unhappy with the new offerings in the PINK range. Earlier this month, a conservative . mommy blogger shocked fellow parents by admitting that she has no . problem with her nine-year-old shopping at Victoria's Secret. Jenny Erikson, from San Diego, . California, sparked fierce debate on parenting site The Stir, when wrote . that she didn't want daughter Hannah 'to be the girl with the ugly . underwear' at camp or slumber parties. She later told Good Morning America: . 'I don't think there's anything wrong with having cute panties and bras . from the big girl store.' But many other mothers took issue . with her decision, arguing that the lingerie giant is 'too sexy', 'not . intended for children', and that Mrs Erikson is at risk of . oversexualizing the youngster at too young an age. One commenter on the GMA website . wrote: 'It's one thing to get your daughter cute, bright colored, fun . underthings, but Victoria's Secret is geared for sexy, not cute.' Another wrote on The Stir: 'Are you . people serious? She is nine years old. I have four girls and as long as . they are under my roof, I will not allow such clothing. Sexy is for . ADULTS.'

Talking to Grazia magazine Victoria said: 'I love fashion, and I love changing my style, my hair, my make-up, and everything I have done in the past has made me what I am now.' 38-year-old Victoria has created a signature style heavy on heels, oversized accessories and sharp separates. And while she is keen to point out that sunglasses and the right accessories can make or break an outfit, surprisingly the petite star claims that heels aren't always the only footwear to be seen in and that flats can be just as chic. Indigo skinny jeans and sunglasses are two of Victoria Beckham's wardrobe must-haves . Always accessorise is another of Victoria's style mantras and she advocates dressing appropriately for the occasion .. a red carpet outfit is not practical if you are running around with the children . She also advises women to match their outfit to the occasion and ditch the bodycon when running around after the children: 'Dress appropriately - not too tight, with room to move around when carrying the kids.'

The website has been three years in . the making, with Victoria telling Elle UK earlier this year that making it user-friendly . enough to satisfy her was the main challenge: 'It . was so important that the concept, tone and look of it were true to me . and my aesthetic and that the shopping experience was the very best that . it could be for my customer.

'I'm incredibly excited with what I have created and the unique access to the brand I am now able to offer.' The site offers visitors the opportunity to 'Shop' or 'Look'. The 'Look' landing page is an online scrap book featuring images and videos from the brand's latest catwalk collections as well as Victoria's own Instagram pictures from the shows and shoots. In the 'Shop' section customers can find accessories - including the £1995 'Victoria' handbag in various colours - eyewear, denim and the diffusion Victoria Victoria Beckham line. The new ready to wear 'Icon' dress collection is also available to buy, with prices starting at £1050 and sizes available in 6 to 14. Victoria told Marie Claire: ‘I have been an online shopper for quite a . long time.

'Too busy': Sir Jeremy Heywood is under fire for failing to conduct an inquiry into 'Plebgate' Top mandarin Sir Jeremy Heywood, under fire for being ‘too busy’ to conduct a proper inquiry into the ‘Plebgate’ scandal, has had a lavish  walk-in wine cellar built at  his £2million home. With the nation facing the prospect of a triple-dip recession and years of austerity, Sir Jeremy, the £190,000-a-year Cabinet Secretary and one of David Cameron’s most trusted advisers, is believed to have spent about £200,000 to build several basement rooms, including the wine cellar. Britain’s most senior civil servant astonished MPs when he admitted last week that he failed to check if former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell had used the word ‘pleb’ when he swore at  a policeman at the gates of Downing Street last year. Sir Jeremy, 51, said he suspected a ‘gigantic conspiracy’ but admitted that he did not  look into the most contentious allegation made about Mr Mitchell, who was forced to  quit over the row, because he  was too busy. Married father-of-three Sir Jeremy is said to have accepted a five-figure bonus  last year despite Cabinet Ministers urging restraint. The wine cellar has been built by specialist firm Oxford and London Building Consultancy.  Its website boasts: ‘We don’t  just install them – we design them from scratch to suit the types of wine you buy. ‘Above all else an OLBC Bespoke Wine Cellar has to reflect your taste in wine and be a place where you can share your love of wine with friends.’ As well as the wine cellar,  plans show Oxford-educated Sir Jeremy’s six-bedroom home in South London now has a study,  kitchen, living room, sitting room, bathroom and storeroom  in the new basement. Astonished: MPs were surprised to hear Sir Jeremy failed to check if former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell (pictured) had used the word 'pleb' when he swore at a policeman . It is believed they will be used by an elderly relative. A spokesman for Sir Jeremy declined to comment last night.","The £190,000-a-year Cabinet Secretary spent £200,000 on basement rooms .

Teenagers' addiction to communicating online has been revealed by a new report which found one in ten now boast more than 1,000 Internet ‘friends’. A study of 200 14-to-18-year-olds in 55 schools found three-quarters had 200 or more Facebook and Twitter followers, while a third had more than 500. Almost half of those questioned admitted they had never met a quarter of their online acquaintances. The findings have prompted fears that they risk damaging their 'real-life' relationships. Addicts: Experts have warned teenagers' obsession with social networking sites could affect their 'real-life' relationships . Changing status: Experts said social networking sites like Twitter are creating a new definition of friendship . Some pupils even claimed social networking had become so addictive that their social lives ‘fail to exist any more’, the study by education providers MB Learning Solutions found. Neurologist Baroness Greenfield, professor of pharmacology at Oxford University, said: ‘If they’re keeping in touch with 200 people, it means the time they’re taking to do that is time not spent rehearsing real-life communication. Their social skills and ability to relate to others will suffer.’ The report by education providers MB Learning Solutions says ‘by no means all of these are real relationships’, adding that almost half of teenagers in its survey said they had never met a quarter of their online followers. Baroness Greenfield warned that young people are in danger of losing their ability to empathise with others because of their over-use of social networking sites. The report quoted students as saying that social networking was so addictive that friends ‘weren’t as social as they used to be’ and their ‘actual social lives fail to exist any more’ Warning: Expert neuroscientist baroness Greenfield said teenagers' social skills and empathy could suffer from too much time communicating online . Baroness Greenfield, professor of . pharmacology at Oxford University, said that teenagers may have 200 . ‘contacts’, but they could not possibly be close friends. She . said: ‘If the majority are keeping in touch with 200 people it means . the time they’re taking to do that is time not spent rehearsing face to . face contact or real life communication. There’s only 24 hours in a . day.' She said it ‘would be a great shame’ if young people thought friendship was merely being able to say ‘you’re thumbs up’ or ‘thumbs down’. She said: ‘Their social skills and ability to relate to others will also suffer. ‘It might mean that your identity’s much more fragile if it needs constant feedback and constant approval from others. ‘It might also mean you develop a rather idealised identity that’s not you and therefore in the end you become more miserable as a result because ‘no-one really understands you’. ‘It also has implications for empathy. We all know that words are only about ten per cent of the impact you have when you talk to someone. There’s also eye contact, body language and physical touching. ‘But when would a young kid learn to do that if they’re communicating through several hundred friends? When would you learn when to put your arm around someone, how it’s appropriate or how to establish eye contact?’ Sue Palmer, literacy expert and author of books including Toxic Childhood, said that social networking sites are creating a new definition of friendship. She said: ‘For many people it’s just a good way of keeping in touch with a few chums or family but for quite a number of young people, it’s a status thing. ‘It’s a PR exercise. You have to wonder why they need to claim so many friends.’ Dr Helen Wright, former headmistress of top girls’ school St Mary’s Calne in Wiltshire, said: ‘You can’t possibly have 600 real friends and be the best in those friendships. Friendships need to be cherished and this isn’t the message that young girls are getting. ‘If it’s possible in just a moment to defriend someone or unfriend them on Facebook, then people say ‘why can’t I do that in real life?’ But of course, it’s not like that, life is not like that.’","New study reveals level of teenage addiction to online communication .

Peep jousting may not be the most well-known Easter tradition, but it certainly is an entertaining one. The seasonal 'sport' involves inserting toothpicks into two of the chick-shaped marshmallows, placing them in the microwave a few inches apart and watching them expand. Whichever Peep grows first, causing its toothpick to pierce the other, is the winner. Scroll down for video . How it works: Peep jousting involves inserting toothpicks into two of the marshmallows, placing them in the microwave a few inches apart and watching them expand. Whichever Peep pierces the other first is the winner . The loser Peep slowly deflates after it is popped by the wooden weapon. This unlikely tradition actually has quite the following - a Facebook page dedicated to the battles has received 150 likes. And in the run-up to Easter, many have taken to Twitter to share their excitement . One enthusiast tweeted: 'I just realized something. This is Peep Season. Get out the microwaves and toothpicks! Peep jousting!!!' Another fan wrote: 'I'm not sure why one would do anything other than Peep jousting with Peeps.' But while enthusiasm for the trend appears to be widespread, the best Peep jousting technique remains a point of dispute. To discover whether fresh or stale Peeps make the best warriors, Smithsonian.com conducted an experiment using one box of marshmallows that had been left open for two weeks, and one that was sealed. After the fresher Peeps won five battles, the website declared them victorious. Victory: After a few seconds, the pink marshmallow can be seen expanding and piercing its rival candy. 'Oh i won! I totally stabbed you,' says its human supporter . Sugary collapse: When the microwave door is opened, both Peeps appear to have grown significantly, but then they gradually sink and deflate . One excited group of friends posted a video on YouTube of their own marshmallow competition. The clip shows a pair of dueling Peeps - one green and one pink - placed face-to-face in the microwave. One of the spectators remarks on the fact that their toothpicks are aimed strategically at the head: 'They're going for the glory,' she says. The group watches as the marshmallows rotate on the microwave dish, slowly growing in size. After a few seconds, the pink marshmallow can be seen expanding and piercing its rival candy. 'Oh i won!

This year the colorful candies are . celebrating their 60th anniversary, and they seem to show no sign of . declining in popularity.

English Heritage plans to stop erecting the blue plaques that commemorate the lives of the great and the good because it can no longer afford to pay for them. The taxpayer-funded quango says the tributes, which have been around for more than 140 years, have ‘an uncertain future’ because of Government cuts. It says it will honour existing commitments but not accept any new nominations. The decision is outlined in a letter to a blue plaque campaigner from Dr Emily Cole, head of English Heritage’s blue plaques team. She said the advisory panel of experts – which includes Stephen Fry, former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion and broadcaster Bonnie Greer  – ‘will be stood down’. Dr Cole wrote: ‘These are extremely . difficult times for English Heritage and for the scheme, which has a . very uncertain future.’ English . Heritage, whose annual budget has been cut from £130 million to . £92 million, may also seek private sponsorship to try to maintain the . scheme. The moves follows . the news that the number of names considered for plaques had been scaled . back, with plans to honour Monty Python star Graham Chapman and cellist . Jacqueline du Pre scrapped. Labour . MP and historian Tristram Hunt said: ‘The blue plaque scheme has been a . genuinely innovative heritage project. It will be an unnecessary loss . and they should do everything possible to keep it going.' Literary . biographer Claire Tomalin added: ‘People love the plaques even if they . do get steamed up about some of the choices. They are part of England’s . glory.’ Scrapped: The news could spell the end for blue plaques such as this tribute to Sherlock Holmes on Baker Street, London . Lord Byron was the first person to be honoured when a plaque was placed on his former London home in 1867. That property has since been demolished. English Heritage, which took responsibility for the scheme in 1986, has erected more than 350 plaques to figures including Vivien Leigh, David Lloyd George and Jimi Hendrix. The public can nominate anyone for the honour but candidates must have been dead for 20 years or have passed the centenary of their birth. They must also be regarded as eminent. English Heritage last night said it was committed to the blue plaques but could not consider any new proposals for the foreseeable future.","Taxpayer-funded quango says it faces 'uncertain future'

Sir Terry Leahy, the former boss of Tesco, has admitted bribing his family to make sure they don’t shop at arch-rival Waitrose. The former retailing boss admits he complains if his wife Alison ever goes into a Waitrose store and reveals he used to pay his three children to inform on her if she did. In an interview on Sunday's Desert Island Discs, Sir Terry reveals he would deliver a ‘severe telling off’ every time he found products from the rival store in the family’s fridge. Store war: Sir Terry Leahy with his wife Alison who he has banned from shopping at Waitrose . He said: 'I actually bribe my children to sort of inform on Alison if ever she popped into Waitrose when she picked up the kids from school.' Asked if his wife had ever shopped at Waitrose Sir Terry replied: 'Occasionally but I would complain so much that she wouldn’t bother.' Sir Terry, who retired as Tesco’s Chief Executive in 2011, is credited with transforming the chain into the country’s most successful retailer and revolutionised shopping by introducing the concept of the loyalty card. He said he understood why people lamented the loss of traditional retailers like the local butcher and baker but insisted that supermarkets were more in tune with the needs of the modern world. He said: 'It is part of progress. People are not made to shop in supermarkets they choose to shop there. High Streets, some of them are Medieval and  the way we live our lives now is very different.  What you have to do is make sure the benefits outweigh the costs and I think that they do.' Success story: Former Tesco boss Terry Leahy is credited with introducing the loyalty card concept and helping transform the supermarket into Britain's most successful retailer . The father-of-three said he believed that 95 per cent of people in Britain liked supermarkets and he  had tried not to take criticism of the company to heart when he was in charge of the £35 million business. He said: 'I tried not to take it personally and to deal with it sensibly and engage with the debate but I felt very strong inside that Tesco was doing the right thing in terms of how it was conducting its business, how it was serving ordinary people how it was employing ordinary people. Arch-rival: Sir Terry bribed his family to make sure they never shopped in Waitrose . 'But I realised I wasn’t winning the argument with some people. 'You see if you talk to people you’ll find that actually 95 per cent of the population quite like supermarkets and five per cent don’t. 'But of course in Britain 5 per cent of is three million people.  They have a voice and they have a right to say what they think.' Sir Terry, who was the son of a greyhound trainer and a nurse and who grew up on a council estate in Merseyside, also expressed concern about the lack of social mobility on some of Britain’s council estates. He said the social networks which had helped him including his local Catholic Church and the grammar school where he was educated  were now in very short supply in some parts of the country. He said: 'I am not sure those council estates have got those same institutions today. That is a shame. 'We have got to find a way of connecting these places  to society  so people who want to can feel they get out and up.' Sir Terry’s desert island selections included I Want To Hold Your Hands by the Beatles, Just Can’t Get Enough by Depeche Mode and Homeward Bound by Simon and Garfunkl. He said he would probably pass his time as a castaway by collecting driftwood so he could build his own branch of Tesco. Desert Island Discs will be broadcast today (Sunday) on BBC Radio 4 at 11.15 am and will be repeated on Friday at 9.00 am.","Sir Terry Leahy pays his children to tell him if his wife shops in a rival store .

It was a victory over the censors the irrepressible Michael Winner would savour for the rest of his life. The director never tired of telling how he and 50 VIP supporters stopped the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) cutting a ‘sadistic’ scene of Faye Dunaway whipping a topless woman from his 1983 romp The Wicked Lady. But now the author Fay Weldon, one of the figures who publicly backed Winner, has revealed that he duped her and her fellow celebrities into siding with him. Controversial: Faye Dunaway starred in the 1983 film The Wicked Lady which features a topless woman being whipped . Supporter: Author Fay Weldon, pictured left, claims she was shown a doctored version of the 1983 film by Michael Winner, pictured right, to convince her to back the movie . Ms Weldon, 81, claims Winner won the support of opinion-formers – including Lucky Jim author Kingsley Amis and John Mortimer, creator of Rumpole Of The Bailey – after showing them a doctored version of the scene. She says: ‘Michael Winner sent me a video of the film prior to its release and I remember thinking it was on the verge of being exploitative but I didn’t think there was anything that should be cut. ‘Indeed, I told the BBFC I would be happy for my 12-year-old son to watch the film. But I saw the film again some years later and I realised Winner had taken us for a ride. We had been shown a cleaned-up version of the same scene.’ She adds: ‘I know some might think, “Well, that is just Michael Winner the lovable old rogue,” but I think it was a very regrettable thing to do. Regrettable but perhaps not surprising.’ Raunchy: BBFC made cuts to the video release of The Wicked Lady starring Faye Dunaway and John Gielgud . Ms Weldon saw the film a second time two years after its cinema release when she joined the BBFC’s Video Reviews Panel, which vetted films for release on video. She informed the BBFC of the discrepancies and the officials ensured the cuts they had wanted for the film’s big-screen version were made for its video release. Her comments shed new light on one of the most controversial censorship rows in cinema history. Winner, who died last month, knew that a high-profile public dispute would boost the film’s chances of being a box-office success. But James Ferman, the then Secretary of the BBFC, told him that without cuts, the film might not even get an 18 certificate – a rating that had recently been brought in to replace the old X category. The board’s examiners thought the scene ‘thoroughly exploitative in a Winnerish way’ and that it introduced ‘an unnecessary degree of sadism’. But in a letter to the BBFC dated March 9, 1983, Winner wrote: ‘Every person who was shown the film took the view that cuts should not be required for the X certificate category. Some even took the view that cuts should not be required even for the PG.’ However, other letters in the BBFC’s archives show that not everyone in the British film industry was impressed with Winner’s battle to beat the censor’s scissors. Lord Puttnam declined to fight Winner’s corner as he objected to the violent treatment of women in films. Winner himself made no reference to his VIP supporters being shown different versions of the film in his autobiography in 2004. And Michael J. Kagan, an associate producer on The Wicked Lady, said he doubted Winner would have doctored the film for anyone. A BBFC spokesman declined to comment.

London Mayor Boris Johnson is interested in taking over the capital’s Blue Plaque scheme, a week after The Mail on Sunday revealed its future was at risk. Mr Johnson, right, has asked his officials to investigate ‘the costs and practicalities’ of running the London scheme, which has so far placed more than 850 plaques on properties across the capital. Senior figures within the Mayor’s Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport believe the idea ‘makes sense’ and are looking at ways he could take over the scheme from English Heritage. Interested: Senior officers within the Mayor's Office believe it 'makes sense' for it to run the capital's Blue Plaque scheme . One senior Government source said: ‘Other local councils run their own versions and there’s no reason why the Mayor can’t be responsible  for the London version. ‘They could probably do it a lot more efficiently than English Heritage for a fraction of the cost.’ English Heritage, which took over responsibility for the Blue Plaques in 1986, says the future of the scheme is ‘uncertain’ because it can no longer afford the £250,000 annual cost. 'Uncertain': English Heritage has said it can no longer afford the £250,000 annual cost of running the scheme . The plaques cost an average of £965 to install at a time when English Heritage’s budget is dropping from £130 million to £92 million. Plaques that have already been approved are still expected to be installed by a team reduced to two full-time employees. A spokesman for the Mayor’s Office last night said that  Mr Johnson had asked for details about the running of the scheme but insisted he had made  no further decisions. Meanwhile, the National Trust last night dismissed reports it was willing to step in and save the scheme.","Boris Johnson has asked his officials to look into the 'costs and practicalities' of running the London scheme .

Hugh Grant has played the archetypal romantic fop so many times that even he jokes that he has only got one string to his bow. But now the Love Actually star has proved his critics wrong by taking on no fewer than six wildly different roles in his new film, Cloud Atlas. Grant looks unrecognisable as many of the characters, especially as the head of a murderous cannibal tribe that terrorises a post-apocalyptic Hawaii. Scroll down to watch the trailer . Killer look: Hugh Grant plays six roles in the film Cloud Atlas, including cannibal tribesman Kona Chief, which required two hours in makeup . Pillaging: Grant, who also plays the manager of a futuristic diner, said he reveled in the chance to do some 'pillaging and throat-slitting' in the film . It took two hours every day to transform an actor best known for playing stuttering upper-class romantic leads into the ‘spectacularly evil’ Kona Chief, with terrifying body paint and tattoos. Grant, 52, said: ‘I was quite intrigued by the story, which is brilliant, but I would have done it just for the chance to be cannibal chief who does a lot of pillaging and throat-slitting. 'There wasn’t much throat-slitting in Sense And Sensibility.’ Grant also plays a 19th Century clergyman, the sinister boss of a nuclear plant, a hotel ‘heavy’, an elderly publisher who breaks out of a tyrannical care home, and the manager of a futuristic diner. The plot comprises six interlinked storylines spanning more than 500 years, and most actors in the film – including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving and Skyfall star Ben Whishaw – play different characters in the various strands. Not so suave: Grant, playing care home Denholme Cavendish, left, is most well-known for his rom-com roles . Grant quipped: ‘When they offered me these parts I thought, “Yes, I can show people I have got more strings to my bow than just one.” But a) I was wrong and  b) it’s just sitting in make-up having  plastic applied to your face for hours.’ But the star said playing the cannibal had been his favourite, joking: ‘I’ve kept the costume. I slip into it sometimes of an evening just to watch the telly. I feel comfortable like that.’ His transformations were so convincing that co-star Jim Broadbent – who appeared alongside Grant in Bridget Jones’s Diary – said he realised it was Grant only when the actor swore at him. True to type: As nuclear plant boss Lloyd Hooks, Grant is back to his usual self . The £65 million adaptation of novelist David Mitchell’s 2004 epic is the most expensive independent movie ever, but has divided opinion. It earned a ten-minute standing ovation at last year’s Toronto Film Festival, but some critics have accused the film – which runs for almost three hours – of rambling. However, several reviewers singled out Grant for praise, and one said he was ‘clearly having a blast’ playing the villains.

Luckily for diver Eli Martinez, the group of deadly tiger sharks has become so accustomed to his presence that they treat him as a plaything, rather than a snack. The 41-year-old has learned how to coax the animals - one of the most dangerous shark species - into rolling over under his touch. Shark's grin: Eli Martinez, 41, interacts with one of the sharks at Tiger Beach in the Bahamas where he visits several times a year . After building up a relationship with the animals at Tiger Beach in the Bahamas, the animals now get so close to the diver that he can even rub his face against theirs. The diver, from  Alamo in Texas, USA, travels to the beach several times a year, having done so for a decade. He always performs the same routine with the animals during the visits. Amazingly, Mr Martinez said he can now identify individual sharks and says that they are also accustomed to his interaction. But despite the amazing level of trust he employs to engage with the sharks, the diver says he never forgets what they are capable of and why they have a . reputation as being one of the top predators in the world. He said: 'They are wild animals so you can never . get 100% comfortable - they are deserving of the respect the other . divers and I show them.

Culture lovers can now make instant donations to their favourite galleries, museums and theatres on their mobile phones thanks to a scheme launched today to protect the arts from the recession. The Donate project allows visitors to give money in seconds if they are feeling inspired to support a show or exhibition. Loss of government grants in the current . austerity measures mean that cultural institutions like the . Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London are now anxious to find other forms of . public funding. National treasure: Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope's Naval Officers of World War I from 1921 which is in need of costly restoration so that a new generation of art lovers can see it . Donations go directly . to specific art works and projects, such as the National Portrait Gallery's . Naval Officers of World War I by Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope. The 17-foot wide painting has not been shown in public since the 1960s because it is in such need of expensive cleaning and repair work. The gallery is hoping to show the portrait in time for the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War. Paul Moorhouse, the gallery's 20th . Century Curator explained: 'Sadly, it has not been seen in decades. 'With . the necessary funds for conservation, the return of this great work in . 2014 would be very appropriate and hugely significant.' Seeking help: The Victoria and Albert Museum, which is currently hosting a David Bowie exhibition, is one of the museums hoping for donations from the public . The painting was one of three commissioned by financier Sir Abraham Bailey to commemorate the end of the war. The other two, Sir James Guthrie’s Statesmen of World War I and John Singer Sargent’s General Officers of World War I, are currently on display without the third in the set. Eleven cultural organisations have signed up for the fundraising drive, including the Octagon theatre in Bolton, the Almeida Theatre in London and the Baltic in Gateshead, for a six month pilot. London's Southbank Centre has chosen its appeal to be the £2.3 million restoration of the pipe organ at the Royal Festival Hall. Research commissioned by the scheme found that people are most likely to . donate money when they are at an exhibition or performance. Comedian Griff Rhys-Jones, who is enthusiastic about getting the public more engaged with the arts, said: 'The idea that you are standing in front of something and . can just step forward and donate is really important.' Culturally significant: Ronni Ancona as Beline and Henry Goodman as Argan in Moliere's The Hypochondriac at the Almeida Theatre, which is one of the 11 organisations signed up for the pilot . Expensive restoration: The Royal Festival Hall is hoping to inspire the public to give generously for refurbishment to its pipe organ . Robert . Dufton, interim chairman of the National Funding Scheme, said the . scheme was to 'engage supporters at the point of emotional engagement . and encourage giving.' Mr Dufton explained: 'Many arts institutions are struggling. They are not recession proof - our research has showed that 36 per cent don’t have enough funding to meet their main objectives. Culture Secretary Maria Miller last year told arts organisations that they needed to 'get better at asking, not just receiving'. The scheme will be rolled out to all arts and heritage charities nationwide by the end of the year.","Donate money to rescue your favourite art works through your phone .

Pope Francis celebrated his first Palm Sunday Mass in St Peter's Square today, as hundreds of thousands joyfully waved olive branches and palm fronds. St Peter's Square overflowed with 250,000 pilgrims, tourists and Italians eager to join the new pope at the start of solemn Holy Week ceremonies, which lead up to Easter. In keeping with his spontaneous style, the first pope from Latin America broke away several times from the text of his prepared homily to encourage the faithful to lead simple lives. The common touch: Popular Pope Francis kisses a baby in St Peter's square in Rome as part of the Palm Sunday celebration on Sunday . Busy time: Pope Francis will be conducting several public services in Rome in the lead up to Easter Sunday when he will again take mass in St Peter's Square . The Palm Sunday ceremony recalls Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, but the Bible also recounts how he was betrayed by one of his apostles and ultimately sentenced to death on a cross. Recalling the triumphant welcome into Jerusalem, Pope Francis said Jesus 'awakened so many hopes in the heart, above all among humble, simple, poor, forgotten people, those who don't matter in the eyes of the world'. Francis then told an off-the-cuff story from his childhood in Argentina. Blessing: Onlookers thrilled to see Francis handed over their children to be held by him as the 'popemobile' was driven through the crowd . Settling in: Pope Francis appeared at ease in his new role as leader of the Catholic Church, as he gave a thumbs-up to the enthusiastic crowd . Hope: In his homily, Francis made an impassioned plea to the crowd: 'Don't let yourselves be robbed of hope' 'My grandmother used to say, 'children, burial shrouds don't have' pockets'' he told the crowd, in a variation of 'you can't take it with you'. 'Don't let yourselves be robbed of hope! Don't let yourselves be robbed of hope!' Francis told the crowd, in an apparent reference to the economic downturn. Since his election on March 13, Francis has put the downtrodden and poor at the centre of his mission as pope, keeping with the priorities of his Jesuit tradition. His name, the first time a pope has called himself Francis, was inspired by St Francis of Assisi, who renounced a life of high-living for austere poverty and simplicity to preach Jesus' message to the poor. Holy Week: Pope Francis met believers after celebrating his first Palm Sunday Mass, which began the lead up to Easter . Commemorative: Some 250,000 faithful Catholics waved olive branches and palm fronds to recall Jesus' entry into Jerusalem . Big turnout: Pilgrims, tourists and locals clambered to see Francis at the Vatican . Francis wore bright red robes over a white cassock as he presided over the Mass at an altar sheltered by a white canopy on the steps of St Peter's Basilica. Cardinals, many of them among the electors who chose him to be the Roman Catholic church's first Latin American pope, sat on chairs during the outdoor ceremony held on a breezy day in Rome. In his homily, Francis said Christian joy 'isn't born from possessing a lot of things but from having met Jesus. That same joy should keep people young,' he said. Spontaneous: The new Pope has a friendly and open approach to meeting the public, prompting many parents to pass their children forward to him . Embrace: The Pope encouraged people to be humble and young at heart as he reached out to children in the crowd . 'From seven to 70, the heart doesn't age' if one is inspired by Christian joy, said the 76-year-old pontiff. Francis said he was joyfully looking forward to welcoming young people to Rio de Janiero for the Catholic Church's World Youth Day. At the end of the two-hour Mass, Francis swapped his red vestments for his plain white cassock and climbed into an open-topped 'popemobile' to circle through the excited crowd. Meet and greet: Bodyguards handed babies up to the Pope, who seemed to enjoy meeting the public - young and old . Outdoor ceremony: Francis blessed the palms under a white canopy, with many of the cardinals who elected him Pope looking on . Solemn: Francis blessed the palms to mark the week leading up to Christ's resurrection on Easter Sunday . Pope Francis prays before a papal mass and blesses the crowd as part of the Palm Sunday celebration . He has plans to visit Brazil in July, where he will attend the Catholic youth gathering, say Mass on Copacabana beach and pray at the Christ the Redeemer statue. So far, that is the first foreign trip on the calendar of Francis' new papacy. The faithful knelt on hard cobblestones paving the square, and Francis knelt on a wooden kneeler at the point in the Gospel that recounts the moment of Jesus' death. On Good Friday, Frances will attend the Way of the Cross procession at the Colosseum and next Sunday he will conduct Easter Mass.

"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:06 EST, 21 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:24 EST, 22 March 2013 . When my son David was small, he had a red anorak that he would not take off. He lived in it, slept in it, he even took his bath in it. That may sound cute, and mildly eccentric, but it wasn’t. It was terrifying, for him, for his mother and for me. David found the world so bewildering that the idea of even unzipping his coat plunged him into screaming, head-battering panic. David is autistic. He can barely communicate, or understand other people, or predict even the basic consequences of his actions. A different world: Christopher Stevens with his autistic son David who is wearing his beloved red coat . That’s hard for anyone who doesn’t suffer from autism to imagine. The new West End production of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time, which opened last week at the Apollo Theatre to ecstatic reviews, sets itself a colossal challenge: to do justice on stage to the often nightmarish world of autism. For parents and siblings, neighbours and teachers, autism is difficult to understand. But we should all at least try to do so, because an estimated half a million people in Britain alone are ‘on the autistic spectrum’ — though thankfully, not many are as severely affected as David. The play is based on novelist Mark Haddon’s award-winning book of the same name, published nine years ago. It tells the story of a 15-year-old boy, Christopher (played on stage by Luke Treadaway), who can solve complex mathematical puzzles in his head but is so socially incapable that he cannot dress or feed himself properly. Haddon never states explicitly that Christopher is autistic, but he depicts many  of the symptoms of one type of autism, Asperger’s syndrome, with clinical accuracy. Unique: As a result of his autism, David, pictured as a toddler, struggles to communicate with other people and is unable to predict the consequences of his actions . Anyone who wants to understand the condition better should see this production. It’s a gripping experience with plenty of unexpected laughs . . . a bit like bringing up a child with autism. It powerfully conveys how it actually feels to be one of those  half-million with the condition. But don’t take an autistic person with you: the lights and the noise of the production are shattering. When Christopher is overwhelmed by confusing stimuli — crowds, chatter, laughter, physical contact with other people — the stage becomes ablaze with flashing diodes and thunderous, bass-heavy music. It makes you want to screw up your eyes and press your thumbs into your ears, the classic autistic response to over-stimulation. Treadaway’s sensitively observed performance captures many of the details of autistic behaviour. He constantly twiddles the cords of his hoodie around his fingers, waggling his hands like a pianist limbering up for a concerto. That’s something my son does whenever he is agitated. He once twiddled a fridge magnet (in the shape of a  capital Q), so obsessively that it became stuck on his finger and had to be dislodged with cutters in A&E. David sees other people as machines — as objects that he must learn to operate — and so he pushes, nudges, drags and steers them into position. He can’t explain what he wants us to do, so he must move us accordingly. Playwright Simon Stephens’s adaptation of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time makes clear this tendency by using actors as props: Christopher sits on them, rides on them, wipes his feet on them, even uses one as a cashpoint. Mirror image: Christopher Stevens recognises his son David's behaviour in that displayed on stage in The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time . Autism is nothing if not self-centred. For Christopher, the only possible viewpoint on the world is his own. In one subtly observed exchange, a neighbour tells him: ‘I don’t want to see you at the moment.’ Christopher obligingly turns his back. He can’t see her and so, according to his faultless logic, she can’t see him. In the same way, when David waves to us, he keeps the palm of his hand towards his face. After all, when we wave to him, he can see our palms, so it makes perfect sense for him to see the lines on his own hand when he waves back. Because people with autism are typically indifferent to what others think, peer pressure is irrelevant. In the play, Christopher loves playing with Thomas The Tank Engine. He always has done and he feels no need to ‘grow up’. But for his parents, that never-ending childhood is embarrassing and exhausting. ‘It’s like he’s just a big baby,’ his despairing dad shouts. Even more draining are the obsessions of an autistic child, the endlessly repeated questions and monologues. Christopher is ‘highly verbal’ — he can talk fluently, but his conversation gets stuck in ruts. He recites facts about astronomy for hours, and repeats cringingly awkward questions over and over. His dad is close to the end of his tether, but Christopher is oblivious. There are heart-stopping moments (at one point, the man next to me was leaning so far forward in suspense that he slid off his seat). Christopher is frightened of many things, but he has no instinct for real danger. My son is the same. He would step out into moving traffic without a qualm. After all, it has always stopped for him before, every time he’s crossed the road. Why should it ever be different? And when Christopher has a meltdown in a store, surrounded by outraged shoppers, I wanted to stand up and yell: ‘Oh, yes — been there!’ By the way, a plea to the general public: when a harassed parent is coping with an autistic meltdown, it’s not helpful to shout: ‘What that child needs is a damn good smack!’ The Curious Incident is about more than autism; it also offers a hard-eyed depiction of a relationship between a mother and father that has been ripped apart, piece by painful piece, under the strain of caring for a child with special needs. My wife Nicky and I have been fortunate. Our marriage has coped, perhaps because we have an older son who has been a dependable source of good humour and calm throughout it all. But caring for an autistic child 24 hours a day for years on end takes its toll: marriages and careers collapse, debts mount up, and stress-related illnesses and drink problems are common. The play tackles this side of dealing with autism without flinching. It also shows how bizarre family life can become when it is always contorted to accommodate the arbitrary needs of an autistic mind. Christopher hates to be touched, so his father can never hug him. Instead, they touch fingertips, like E.T. and  the little boy he befriends in Spielberg’s film. Anything can seem normal if it happens often enough. For years, my left arm was bruised because of David’s helpful habit of prodding it with his foot from the back seat when it was time to use the indicator while driving: one tap with the toe to the elbow when turning left, one thwhack to the bicep for right. On stage: Luke Treadaway in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at the Apollo Theatre . Seems unthinkable, doesn’t it? But you don’t just get used to these things, they become part of the fabric of your life. You might think Christopher’s father in the play can’t cope with his son for a moment longer — until you see him trying to cope without him. While the play gets a great deal right, not everything rings true. A promised Saturday outing for Christopher is cancelled because his dad wants to watch an England football game on the telly. This seemed to me utterly unrealistic. That sort of luxury, sadly, is an impossibility for single parents of autistic teenagers. In one sequence, Christopher daydreams about the sensation of floating in space. It’s beautifully staged but out of character. Imagination, the mental power to see in the mind’s eye something that hasn’t happened, is absent  in autism. Those are quibbles. There are some graver misunderstandings. I was saddened by the portrayal of Christopher’s head teacher as a lazy, spiteful jobsworth. Heaven knows that parents with disabled children have to deal with various incompetent and obstructive officials, but in my experience, the great majority of special needs teachers are dedicated and inspiring individuals. David is nearly 17 now, and he’s had many teachers. Energy, determination and selflessness have been hallmarks of all of them. It’s a pity, too, that Christopher had to be portrayed with a special talent: an outstanding gift for maths. This gift gives momentum to the story, of course, and it provides a theme for the staging (the set is lined like graph-paper and Christopher draws on it in chalk, the way Einstein used to scrawl on blackboards). I’ve known plenty of autistic children but never one with a superpower — or, at least, not a useful one. My son David has the uncanny ability to identify any Disney video cassette without looking at it, simply by picking it up and rattling it when it’s been removed from its case. I don’t just mean that he can tell The Lion King apart from 101 Dalmatians with his eyes closed. I mean that at 4am, in a pitch-black room with 500 videos piled on the floor, he can locate that one copy of The Lion King that he’s looking for by the rattle alone. It’s not quite a superpower, but it is a remarkable talent and unique to my beloved, exhausting and eternally curious son. I wish I knew how.","Christopher Stevens' 17-year-old son David has autism .

"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 19:04 EST, 2 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:04 EST, 2 April 2013 . Off-screen, everyone refers to Ant and Dec as ‘the boys’. It fits. Dressed in baseball caps and baggy trousers, rapping and dancing on their variety show Saturday Night Takeaway, they look more like teenagers than middle-aged men. They’ve been professional ‘cheeky chappies’ for so long — right back to the late Eighties when they starred in the children’s soap Byker Grove — that we can’t imagine them growing up. Even though they’re now 37, they are eternal kids — and they know that’s their appeal. But Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly were as surprised as anyone when their  charity single Let’s Get Ready To Rhumble rocketed to the top of the charts on Sunday. With all the profits going to ChildLine, it has been selling around 20,000 copies a day. Number one: Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, better known as Ant and Dec, show that nice guys do not finish last in show-business . Twenty-four hours earlier, ITV1’s Takeaway trounced BBC1’s The Voice in the Saturday-night ratings, pulling in a million more viewers at 7.2 million. But Ant and Dec are no mere TV presenters: after 25 years in showbiz, they are part of the national fabric. Everyone knows them, even if many would never admit to watching the shows they host, which include I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! and Britain’s Got Talent. And so that viewers can tell them apart, they use a simple trick — Ant is always on the viewer’s left, and Dec on the right. Always. Admittedly, not all of their series are hits —  Red Or Black flopped badly and Push The Button turned out to be a forgettable update of The Generation Game. Attempts to break America have also failed. Ant, in particular, is unhappy that some of the successful formats the duo have launched here have transferred to the States without them. On top: After reaching the top of the charts this weekend, the pair tweeted 'O.M blummin' G! We're Number blummin' 1! Thank u! You're all nuts but we love! Cheers! D #LetsGetReadyToRhumble' Yet when they revived their 1994 hit Let’s Get Ready To Rhumble on Takeaway ten days ago, it was clear they were back to doing what they love most: cheering us all up with a mixture of genuine, unforced charm and precision professionalism. They threw themselves into the dance routine, high-stepping and body-popping, with grins on their faces and concentration in their eyes. What’s fascinating is that Takeaway is hardly a trailblazing format — it’s fairly standard family telly along on the lines of Noel’s House Party. The element of alchemy comes in the sheer infectious energy of Ant & Dec, and it’s meant they’ve never had to be controversial or crude to keep their act fresh. That’s the essence of their appeal — they don’t take themselves seriously. But they’re utterly serious about what they do, and they share a real friendship that seems immune to the pressures of the business. Unlike most TV personalities, they appear to understand that what they’re doing is not deep and meaningful. It’s called light entertainment for a reason, and it’s none the worse for that. They recognise their limitations, too, and are never afraid to share a stage with other talents. In this sense, they’re mirroring Morecambe and Wise, who are often regarded as their role models. Eric and Ernie — the greatest double act in British comedy — were always happy to bring in guests such as Glenda Jackson and Shirley Bassey, who loaded their shows with star presence. Ant and Dec may not be quite in the same league but they do exactly  the same. Last Saturday, they brought in Lewis Hamilton, Simon Cowell and the singer Michael Bublé. The duo’s instincts to never hog the limelight or seem as though they believe their own publicity helps us to avoid overdosing. Unlike other stars who seem too ubiquitous — Stephen Fry is an obvious culprit — Ant and Dec know how much exposure is enough. Old school: Cheeky chappies Ant and Dec as Pj and Duncan back in the days when they were ready to 'rhumble' That helps their star to keep glittering instead of burning out. So does their evident love for trashy TV. They grew up enjoying gameshows and quizzes, and this heartfelt love of the medium and its traditions, particularly family TV, reflects their upbringing. Both Ant and Dec grew up in three-bedroom council houses in  Newcastle. Dec was the youngest of seven children born to an Irish couple, Anne and Alphonsus. Five years younger than his nearest sibling, he was always the baby and centre of attention. Money was tight: the four boys slept in one room, the three sisters shared another, and their parents had the third. Dec was soon supplementing the family income by performing jokes and dance routines at the Tyneside Irish Centre, which his parents ran, and going around afterwards collecting tips in an ashtray. Ant had one sister, and lived opposite his mother’s parents. His parents separated when he was eight, and four years later he joined the cast of Byker Grove as the laddish PJ. Dec was already in the series, as the mischievous Duncan. The producers immediately saw the potential of pairing them in comic storylines. But they didn’t become friends until a couple of years later, when Ant sent Dec a Christmas card with a PS: ‘Fancy going to the Newcastle-Swindon match on Boxing Day?’ ‘Boxing Day 1990 was our first date,’ Ant jokes. ‘But there wasn’t a magical moment where Dec and me bonded and decided to spend the rest of our lives together.’ Two years later, they launched a pop career as PJ and Duncan, performing at under-18s discos. They reached No 9 in the single charts with Rhumble and No 5 in the album charts with Psyche but neither was a fan of their own music — Dec admits he prefers Sinatra to anything recorded in the past 50 years. They dropped the PJ and Duncan characters, and started presenting children’s programmes as themselves. Like the reality shows and variety . bills they host today, the Bafta- winning Ant & Dec Show on CBBC . appealed to all ages. They make the sort of telly that grandmas can . watch with grandchildren. That gives Ant & Dec licence to . mock other celebs, and even to put them through tortures in I’m A . Celebrity. But they never come across as vindictive or spiteful. Through all of this, their magic . formula is to project a genuine friendship. They bicker but with . affection; they tease, sulk and send each other up so naturally it feels . as though they are simply extending their off-screen relationship in . front of the cameras. Though both enjoy a pint, they are too experienced to develop bad habits that may risk their careers. They also make no secret of their need to earn money and of their nagging fear, common to most entertainers from poor backgrounds, that all their earnings might somehow vanish overnight. But they have resisted the temptation to cash in greedily like many contemporaries — by doing ads for loan firms or injury lawyers, for instance. And in 2010, when ITV’s finances were taking a battering, they accepted a reduction in salaries, rather than tout their services to the highest bidder. They are, in short, professionals. As Dec once recalled: ‘We might have been kids but we were getting paid, and there was a word for what we were doing. It was called a job.’ A major difference in their lifestyles that could have pushed them apart — Ant is married while Dec is single — seems to have sealed the friendship. When Ant wed his long-term girlfriend Lisa Armstrong in 2005, Dec was best man. Dec’s former girlfriend, TV presenter Georgie Thompson, says: ‘Lisa is such a strong character and she has to be. She has been the person who grounds them through it all. Dec is incredibly close to her — they are like brother and sister. And it’s a lovely relationship between the three of them — it works really well.’ The duo’s temperaments are different, too. Dec is confident and gregarious. Ant is more reserved, taking his time to size up people. His reticence sometimes comes across as aloofness, which can cause problems: last year, while watching football in a pub, he was punched by a yob who had been taunting him. The incident echoed a similar assault 20 years ago, when a man walked up to him at a bar, insulted him then hit him in the face, blackening his eye. Despite these differences, Ant and Dec are inseparable — they even live within a few doors of each other in West London — and in interviews they hint they’ve taken out £2 million life-insurance policies because the death of one would surely end the other’s career. The money would be scant compensation, of course, and not just for their rumoured £6 million salaries at ITV. As Dec puts it: ‘Ours is a career built on a friendship, not a friendship built on a career.’ That can’t be faked. And as long as they make us believe we can share that bond, we’ll keep  tuning in.",Success for 'nice guys' Ant and Dec on screen and in the charts .

At least one US school district has already warned parents that their children may have been fed E.coli contaminated food. Ten million lbs of frozen food has been recalled by Rich Products Corp. in the past two weeks after 27 cases of E.coli illnesses, spread across 15 states, have been linked to their products. Danger: Around 300,000 of the ten million lbs products withdrawn, which includes Farm Rich mini pizzas, have been distributed to US schools cafeterias . Rich Products, based in Buffalo, N.Y., estimates that about three million lbs may still be on the market, in stores, homes and in schools. Harford County schools, Maryland told parents they had been notified last week that the pepperoni pizzatas served in school cafeterias across the district had been recalled, some of which have already been served. Dwight Gram of Rich Products said the main items shipped to schools were labelled as pizza dippers and pepperoni pizzatas of the Farm Rich brand. Mr Gram added that the food served in schools may be safer than that which has been purchased by individuals as the items are more likely to be thoroughly cooked, killing the E.coli bacteria. The particular strain of E.coli linked to the Farm Rich brand products is so rare some laboratories are still unable to identify it. Warning: Farm Rich pizza dippers contaminated with E.Coli may have been served to children across the US after frozen foods from Rich Products' Georgia plant were found to carry the bacteria . Contaminated: Rich Products Corp. have been forced to recall some of their products after 27 cases of E.coli illnesses - spread across 15 states - were linked to their frozen food . As a result many illnesses may not have been identified, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

According . to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 81 per cent . of the people who fell ill were under the age of 21, but it is not yet . clear whether any illnesses are linked to foods shipped to schools. Nine people were hospitalized and two have developed haemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure that can have lasting effects. Rich Products two weeks ago announced a voluntary recall of certain Farm Rich and Market Day brand products because of the possible E. coli contamination. Last week, the company expanded the recall to include everything made at its plant in Waycross, Georgia, a full ten million lbs of frozen food products. Products manufactured at other plants have not been affected. An E. coli infection can cause mild diarrhoea or more severe complications, including kidney damage.","E.coli contaminated food may have been served in East Coast schools .

Every day this week, there are food shows on the telly. From Masterchef to Hairy Bikers, Come Dine With Me to The Great British Bake Off, it seems we’ve got a gluttonous appetite for cookery on the box. It’s all about recipes and ingredients, the subtleties of preparation and presentation. Or is it? While Si, Dave, Mary and Paul are revealing their culinary secrets, millions of viewers are chewing over more basic thoughts: ‘I fancy a plate of that. I wonder if there are any crisps left?’ Food appeals to our deepest animal instincts. Clothes, however, don’t. The way to a man’s heart, as the proverb says, is through his stomach ... not up his elegantly tailored shirt-sleeve. That’s what dooms The Great British Sewing Bee to failure. Home-made . clothes don’t answer a primal need. It was mildly interesting, for ten . minutes, to learn about the history of pattern books and how the A-line . skirt got its name. Mildly interesting; not gripping. Eight . contestants were striving to impress the judges with their sewing . skills, knocking up garments from scratch against a deadline. The . researchers had obviously struggled to find any male seamstresses, so . they’d come up with  Stuart, a fitness instructor who had never stitched . a skirt before, and Mark, a lorry driver whose hobby was making . ‘steampunk’ (a futuristic take on Victoriana) costumes for  sci-fi . conventions. Easily the most impressive of the . eight was Ann, a 75-year-old yoga enthusiast. We first met her hanging . upside down in the lotus position. She’d been sewing ever since she started making clothes for her dolls as a child.

Today her work is of a professional standard, but I still didn’t want to spend an hour watching her put pleats and darts in. Judge and Savile Row tailor Patrick Grant emerged as a wryly mannered wit. Holding up one blouse, he sniffed: ‘It’s good from afar, but it’s far from good.’ And after declaring that most dress-making was the art of simple measurements, he took one look at the bustline of a well-endowed model and said: ‘It’s  complex geometry in there.’ For long stretches, though, the programme was as engaging as an instructional video. Naturalist Nigel Marven¿s infectious enthusiasm, on the other hand, lit up Whale Adventure. Historian Tom Fort made the same mistake on Crossing England In A Punt — his journey down the River Trent had the feel of an educational programme for schools. There were beautifully composed shots of poppies and cowslips in  riverbank meadows, mallards and mute swans floating on the currents, but the commentary ignored the evocative and went straight for Gradgrindian facts. The Trent is 170 miles long, Fort recited; it rises on Biddulph Moor, almost 1,000ft above sea level; James Brindley began the Trent and Mersey canal in 1766; it requires ten pints of water to make one pint of beer; in Stoke during the Seventies there were 200 ceramics factories and now there are only 30. What could have been a personal paean to vanishing England became a GCSE geography lesson. Naturalist Nigel Marven’s infectious enthusiasm, on the other hand, lit up Whale Adventure. When a harpooned whale dragged a . wooden boat at high speed across the waves, 19th- century whalers called . it the  ‘Nantucket sleigh ride’. Marven’s four-part documentary up the . American west coast, following the grey whale migration, had that same . breakneck feel. Last night . he ventured out between the ice floes into the  Chukchi Sea in the . Arctic Ocean to watch whales feeding on shrimp-like creatures called . amphipoda. In the silver-blue water under a midnight sun, these mammals . looked like sea monsters — filmed from the air, their immense bulks . shone ghost-like under the water. Marven was full of facts, too — the musk ox has the longest hair in the animal kingdom, for instance — but his delivery was never stuffy: the information just seemed to burst out of him. In the end, this travel documentary was sheer romance, where its BBC Four rival was as dry as a school textbook. Beyond the boundaries of one Alaskan town, Barrow, the inhabitants had to dump heaps of whalebone and blubber, to attract the local polar bears and discourage them from wandering down the main street. You don’t get that in Burton- on-Trent.","The way to man's heart is through his stomach, not his tailored shirt-sleeve - that is what dooms The Great British Sewing Bee ."

A Minneapolis-St. Paul airport worker is charged with stealing more than $84,000 worth of shotguns, revolvers, and other weapons and items from passengers' luggage. David Vang, 23, faces 11 felony counts, including 10 counts of theft of a firearm after video surveillance linked him to the theft of more than 700 items stolen from passengers with connecting flights. Authorities say Vang of St. Paul scoured through the checked luggage behind closed doors, taking whatever valuables he could find including a crossbow, jewelry, iPads, laptops, cell phones and other electronics. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Theft: David Vang, 23, and his wife Vue Xiong, 21, face felony charges after video surveillance linked him to the theft of more than 700 stolen items including firearms from airport luggage . Footage captured Vang then taking the items to an unsecured employee parking ramp where his wife, Vue Xiong, 21, was waiting in a vehicle, the criminal complaint said. His wife was charged with one count of felony theft. A search of his apartment found several boxes containing 716 items in all, the complaint said. Pat Hogan, spokesman for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, said Monday that Vang was employed by a Texas firm to maintain the belt on which checked baggage traveled. Hogan said authorities learned in September that weapons were being stolen, so they set up surveillance cameras. Caught: Video cameras set up allegedly caught Vang, seen here, going through luggage at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport before filling up his backpack . Vang was arrested in October and is no longer working at the airport, Hogan said. According to the complaint, Vang initially claimed the weapons and other items fell out of luggage as it came down the line, but later admitted to stealing, saying he had been doing it since last summer. 'When asked why he did it, Defendant Vang stated that he just wanted the items,' the complaint said. Hogan said authorities realized there was an issue when they started getting reports that weapons were disappearing during passengers' connecting flights. Firearms must be packed in separate cases and scanned as a separate piece of luggage, so authorities can determine when a case containing a weapon is removed from one airplane and placed on another. Strategy: Vang allegedly went through the checked luggage of passengers with connecting flights at the airport, pictured, before looting them and taking them to his wife waiting outside . 'In this case, only connecting bags were being pilfered,' Hogan said. 'Weapons were scanned as coming into (Minneapolis-St. Paul) but not scanned as going into the aircraft, so that's what alerted us that there was an issue here.' Hogan said thefts from luggage are rare, but the airport recommends travelers place valuables such as jewelry in their carry-on luggage. Weapons, however, must be checked. 'Fortunately, we don't deal with this kind of situation very often,' Hogan said. 'Once we found out about it, we were able to track him down and bring him to justice.' Online court records do not list an attorney for Vang. A working home phone number for Vang was not available on Monday. He will be making his first court appearance April 25 in Hennepin County.","David Vang, 23, accused of looting checked luggage of connecting flights before taking items to his wife waiting outside .

She is wearing that rainbow of color, a cheeky print and, most likely, a smile on her face. What Lilly Pulitzer did for fashion is more a story about what she did for women: She made them happy. She made them laugh. She gave them a mini vacation. Style signature: Lilly Pulitzer, pictured in her Lilly shift in 1965, died yesterday at the age of 81. She became known for cheeky prints and easy cuts that women across America loved . 'Her clothes were transporting,' said Adam Glassman, creative director of O, The Oprah Magazine. 'You automatically think of Palm Beach, or sunny California in a Slim Aarons photograph.' Lilly Pulitzer died Sunday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 81. She had launched her business in the 1950s - by accident. She was socialite with time to spare and a wealthy husband who owned citrus groves, so she started a juice stand on a busy shopping street. Fashion darling: Pulitzer pictured in 2002 after her spring 2003 catwalk show in New York . She needed dresses in tropical prints . (no dowdy aprons for Lilly!) that would hide stains. The loose, . sleeveless cotton shape that came to be known as the shift was perfect . for the task and local climate. Gilded by Lilly: Pulitzer's designs became popular for baby showers, weddings, and garden and pool parties . 'I designed collections around . whatever struck my fancy . . . fruits, vegetables, politics or peacocks! I . entered in with no business sense. It was a total change of life for . me, but it made people happy,' Pulitzer told The Associated Press in . 2009. Her clothes, and . later accessories and home goods, weren't dictated by runway trends or . sweeping sociological statements: They were about lifestyle, and a . lifestyle that real people had or, at least, wanted. Few people wear their Lilly Pulitzer pieces on a dreary day, or to a routine dental appointment or a boring business meeting. You see them at baby showers, weddings, and garden and pool parties. You'll see them on little girls, their mothers and grandmothers, because no one corners the market when it comes to being cheerful. Pulitzer and the company she sold her name to court women of different ages, body types and hometowns, Glassman noted, but what links them all together is a 'life's a party' attitude. There's a broader audience than one might think for pineapple-printed swimsuits and monkey-covered caftans. They're almost a given for a Southern belle or a Nantucket prepster, but even cosmopolitan city sophisticates can't wait to pull out their sunniest styles and head out to the Hamptons. The brand was purposefully inclusive, said Janie Schoenborn, now the vice president of creative communications of Lilly Pulitzer's former company. The bright stuff: Pulitzer's scarf designs in an array of her famous tropical prints . 'If someone is wearing the same print, . you high five them! I don't want to use the word ""club,"" though, because . that seems exclusive. Anyone who is happy and wants to have a good time . can come to our party.' Sunny disposition: Pulitzer pictured in 2004 during an interview in her company's Manhattan offices . Schoenborn said Lilly Pulitzer occupies a . unique spot in the fashion world. 'It's so not fashion-y, but it is . fashion because it has such a strong point of view.' 'The look is colorful, it tends to be . preppy - it's an iconic American look based on a lifestyle that's based . around these prints,' Glassman said. Pulitzer also paved the way for today's popular lifestyle brands, including Tory Burch, Tibi and Milly, and even Ralph Lauren, Glassman added. It was a different business than the avant-garde catwalk designers showing in Europe during the '60s. It was about loyalty and longevity instead of drastic swings of the pendulum. Then-first lady and fashion plate Jacqueline Kennedy, a former schoolmate of Pulitzer, wore one of the shifts in a Life magazine photo spread, confirming the look's legitimacy. Pulitzer retired from the day-to-day business in 1993 after a rough patch in the Eighties era of power dressing. But the company and its hallmark prints have returned to profitability. Chain reaction: Pulitzer had stores like this Boston outpost across America . Sales of the brand were strong in the earnings period that ended Feb. 2, according to parent company Oxford Industries' report. Revenue increased 26per cent to $29.1 million. Pulitzer's attitude is still pervasive . at the company and in new products, said Schoenborn. 'If we've put a . twinkle in your eye, then we have honored her.'","Pulitzer died yesterday at her home in Palm Beach, Florida. She was 81 ."

A previously unseen letter showing the softer side of the famously stoic captain of the Titanic has emerged. Captain Edward Smith has passed into legend for going down with his ship shouting 'Be British' as the luxurious liner sank on April 15, 1912. But a touching letter he sent to his daughter has shown an altogether different side to the captain, who was known for both his discipline and toughness. Legendary: The softer side of Captain Edward Smith (left) has been revealed by a loving letter (right) he wrote to his eight-year-old daughter . Softer side: Captain Smith on RMS Baltic - a few years before his transfer to the doomed Titanic . The letter was sent home to his daughter while Captain Smith was serving as the head of another ship before he took charge of the Titanic for her maiden voyage. In the letter Captain Smith draws a picture of a little bird and apologises for not being able to send a bunny to his young daughter Helen. The letter reads: 'My dear Daughter, I could not catch a little bunny to send you in my letter so send you a card by this little bird. I hope Mother and you and Gladys are well. I shall soon be home. Your loving Daddy.' Smith joined White Star Line as a fourth officer on the SS Celtic in 1880. He worked his way up through the ranks to become one of the top ship commanders for the company. He wrote the letter to eight-year-old Helen while serving as the captain of the RMS Baltic on November 29, 1906.

Andrew Aldridge, of the auctioneers, said: 'Captain Smith was well known for his bravery and for going down with the ship. 'He was a tough and hard man, one who was incredibly disciplined by all accounts. Loving: The letter, which is signed 'Daddy', is expected to sell for £10,000 at the auction . 'But this letter to his daughter shows a different side to this man, who has been immortalised in various books, films and television productions, altogether.

'It shows us a loving and caring side to him and offers a window into his soul.'

An MSNBC news anchor has ignited controversy with a TV ad promoting the network, in which she says children belong to communities, not to their parents. Melissa Harris-Perry, host of a Sunday morning MSNBC show that bears her name, cut the promo spot to promote her program. And conservative pundits Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck are seeing red. 'We have never invested as much in public education as we should have,' Harris-Perry says in the ad, 'because we've always had kind of a private notion of children: ""Your kid is yours, and totally your responsibility."" We haven't had a very collective notion of ""these are our children.""' 'So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sarah Palin (L) and Glenn Beck (R) lashed out at MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry for suggesting that communities - not individual parents - bear the largest responsibility for raising children . 'Once it's everybody's responsibility, and not just the household's, then we start making better investments,' Harris-Perry adds, in a subtle call for more government spending on education programs. Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, vented her outrage on Twitter. 'Apparently MSNBC doesn't think your children belong to you,' she tweeted. 'Unflippingbelievable.' The theme of collective child-rearing first most famously caused trouble for American liberals when Hillary Clinton, then the first lady, made a similar argument in her book titled It Takes A Village. Sarah Palin hit the roof on Twitter after seeing Melissa Harris-Perry's latest network promo ad on MSNBC . Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady, published It Takes A Village, which made the point that collective child-rearing was superior to individual parents raising their kids without the government's help or intrusion . Glenn Beck, the conservative former Fox News talk show host who now has his own paywall-protected online TV show, snarked in response to the Harris-Perry commercial that now 'my kids do not belong to me. My kids are not my kids. They are the community's kids.' 'So, I don’t really have responsibility for my kids. I can look to the state to also take that responsibility and, quite honestly, that burden from me.' Beck editorialized that MSNBC didn't make a gaffe but was consciously endorsing a socialist view of child-rearing. 'This is not a mistake,' he said on The Blaze TV. 'This is the announcement of where they’re headed.' 'What’s really horrible about this,' Beck added, is the idea behind this is going to be so appealing to so many people.'

Experts have warned production in the world's best wine regions could fall by two thirds because of climate change. There will be a sharp decline in wine production from Bordeaux, in France, Tuscany, Italy, and Napa Valley in California, by 2050, a study has said. But the change will see a 'big push' into areas which had previously been thought of as unsuitable - such as Tasmania and China. Vineyards in Napa Valley, California. Experts have warned production in the world's premier wine regions could fall by two thirds because of climate change . Wine grapes are known to be sensitive to changes in temperature, rain and sunshine. Lee Hannah, a senior scientist at Conservation International and an author of the study said climate change will lead to a 'huge shakeup in the geographic distribution of wine production' because of big changes in regions enjoying the cool winters and hot dry summers that produce good grapes. He told the Guardian: 'It will be harder and harder to grow those varieties that are currently growing in places in Europe.' The findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers used 17 different climate . models to ascertain the effects on nine major wine-producing areas. Changing face of wine production: Map shows the change in suitability for wine production between now and 2050. Areas that are currently suitable for wine production but won't be in 2050 are red. Areas that are suitable at present and are still suitable in 2050 are green. Areas which will become suitable are light blue and dark blue . The Chateau Carbonnieux vineyard in Leognan, outside Bordeaux - one of the areas experts have claimed could suffer from climate change . They used two different climate futures for 2050. One assumed a 4.7C (8.5F) warming, the other a 2.5C increase. The most drastic . decline was predicted in Europe, where the scientists found a 85 per cent . decrease in production in Bordeaux, Rhone and Tuscany. In wine growing areas of Australia, there was a forecast 74 per cent drop, and California, a 70 per cent fall. The scientists also predicted a sharp decline for wine growers in the Cape area of South Africa with falls of 55 per cent, and Chile's wine producers would expect losses of about . 40 per cent. But the change in climate could see a boom in new world wine in new territory such as . Tasmania and the . hills of central China. However, Rebecca Shaw, a scientist for the Environmental Defence Fund and an author of the paper, warned the search for new wine country could unearth a host of new potential problems, as many of the areas being touted for production are home to endangered wildlife. She said: 'Wine is going to be on the move in the future as will wildlife.

A gorilla who was mutilated in an attack by poachers can walk again after a team of British vets amputated his left arm to free him from the chronic pain he had suffered. Shufai was targeted by brutal gunmen a decade ago - they killed his mother for bushmeat and left him with severe bullet injuries in his arm. As gorillas use all four limbs to walk, the ape was unable to get around for years and rescuers began to fear he might never recover. Scroll down for video . Victim: Shufai the gorilla has had his left arm removed a decade after being injured by poachers . Surgery: The ape was operated on in a converted schoolroom in the middle of the Cameroon jungle . But now a specialist team has flown out from Britain to Shufai's home in the Cameroon jungle and removed part of his arm in order to reduce the pain and make him mobile again. Sharon Redrobe, zoological director of Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire, has followed the ape's extraordinary life for years, and regularly visits the Ape Action Africa centre where he lives. She performed the delicate surgery alongside a number of other British vets by flying out pre-sterilised equipment and adapting a local schoolroom into an operating theatre. Recovered: He may only have one arm, but Shufai is now as mobile and agile as other gorillas . Delicate: Shufai was treated by a team of vets who flew to West Africa from Britain . Patient: Shufai being wheeled back home after the surgery to amputate his limb . 'It's a world away from where I'm used to operating but our primary mission was help our project grow,' she said. 'We had to make the difficult decision to amputate Shufai's arm after X-rays showed damage to his wrist had worsened. 'But since returning to the UK he has made a full recovery and his healing time has been remarkable.' Shufai arrived at the sanctuary 10 years ago, and was so traumatised and injured that staff did not expect him to survive. Treatment: Shufai beginning to recover back in the sanctuary where he lives, Ape Action Africa . Success: The doctors smiling with the gorilla, who can now walk again after a decade of disability . Healthy: Shufai has been able to rejoin his relatives and is finally free of debilitating pain . The western lowland gorilla first underwent surgery from Ms Redrobe last year, but unfortunately his health deteriorated rapidly and he found it hard to adjust. Rachel Hogan, the director of Ape Action Africa, has made it her life's mission to save orphaned chimpanzees, gorillas and other primates. Despite contracting malaria an incredible nine times, she has stuck with her team in West Africa to see the project through and keep supporting animals like Shufai. Stump: But the operation was the only way to get the gorilla back on his feet . Dedication: Sharon Redrobe, of Twycross Zoo, has made several visits to Cameroon to monitor Shufai . 'It was hard for the whole team but seeing Shufai back with his family group is a huge relief and he can now look forward to a pain-free life,' she said. 'I can't thank the vet team enough for the incredible work they did and their support of Shufai and Ape Action Africa.' Twycross Zoo's World Primate Centre cares for more than 35 species of primate, many of which are critically endangered in the wild due to poaching and habitat loss.","Shufai left unable to use left arm after poaching attack a decade ago .

Around 100 paedophiles have been chemically castrated under a Government scheme to stop them reoffending. The sex offenders volunteered to take drugs designed to stifle their libido during a pilot experiment at HMP Whatton in Nottinghamshire. The drug reduces their testosterone levels to that of a prepubescent boy for a three-month period. After that, it wears off. Potential subjects: The drug could be used on Whatton inmates such as . sex offender Neil Wilkinson, left, or on offenders like Roy Whiting, killer of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, right . The ongoing experiment could revolutionise the way the British penal system deals with sick criminals incarcerated at Whatton. These have included rapist Neil Wilkinson, who later killed his cellmate, and Barry Wade, who was jailed for seven years for offences against two young girls. The drug is already mandatory for child sex offenders in Poland, Russia and certain U.S. states. Chemical castration involves a man taking hormones that suppress the production of testosterone, leading to a decreased sex drive. Poland introduced mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders in 2009, it was introduced in South Korea in September and Russia and Moldova are following suit. Both Germany and the Czech Republic have been criticised by Europe's top human rights body for using voluntary surgical castration to treat sex offenders. It could . become the norm in Britain as treatment for notorious criminals such as . Roy Whiting, who murdered eight-year-old Sarah Payne in 2000, or Colin . Blanchard, who ran the online child sex network that included nursery . worker Vanessa George. The programme at HMP Whatton, a specialist category C prison which holds male sex offenders, has been run by the Prison Service and the Department of Health since 2009, and is co-ordinated by criminal psychiatrist Professor Don Grubin. 'I have referred around 100 people for treatment,' he told The Daily Mirror - a figure that includes offenders who are being given the drug while in the community, as part of a scheme which has been running since 2007. 'We know the treatment works to reduce sexual arousal and fantasies.' Chemical castration can cut the rates of reoffending from 40 per cent to five per cent, according to researchers in Scandinavia. The medication is intended for use on those with compulsive or impulsive urges to offend and those . who have difficulties in controlling sexual arousal, intrusive sexual . fantasies or urges, sadism or other 'dangerous' tendencies such as . necrophilia. The prison now hopes to extend the voluntary scheme beyond the end of the year. Guinea pigs: Inmates at category C Whatton prison can volunteer to try the chemical castration drug . One drug used, leuprorelin (marketed as Prostap) inhibits the typically high sex drives of paedophiles by limiting the production of testosterone. But the manufacturers admit it is likely that 'only small numbers of sex offenders will benefit from these treatments.' Psychologist . Dr Ludwig Lowenstein backed chemical castration, emphasising that a child's right to protection was much more important than the freedom of paedophiles. He said: 'Apart from lengthy jail . sentences, the only other way to deal with most of these people is . through chemical castration. Ex-offenders: The drugs could be used on men like Barry Wade, left, who was jailed at Whatton for offences against two young girls, and Stan Carberry, right, who was imprisoned there for sex attacks on children . 'The idea of giving sexual . offenders a pill to destroy their ability to have intercourse always . provokes fierce objections on the grounds of civil liberties. Inmates and ex-inmates of Whatton prison include: . 'But a . child's right to protection is far more morally important than the . freedoms of paedophiles.' But Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison . Reform Trust, said: 'It's difficult to see why anyone would invest . public money in controversial medication when you could fund sex . offender treatment in prison, police and public protection on release, . all of which are proven to reduce reoffending.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We support . the use of pharmaceutical interventions for high risk sex offenders . given the evidence that it can be useful in reducing risk for some . perpetrators.' HMP Whatton has come in for its fair share of criticism over the years. In May 2010, convicted paedophile Kevin Skaith demanded that more highbrow channels be made available at the facility. The 43-year-old, who was serving a three-and-half year sentence for possessing nearly 120,000 images of children, complained that his options were limited to 'soap, sex and sport'. In 2007, the prison was condemned for offering inmates cash bonuses for good behaviour during a staff strike, and a year earlier, up to £5,000 of taxpayers' money was put aside for quiz prizes. There was further controversy when a prison officer at the institution was suspended for allegedly intimidating a prisoner with a baton.","Former inmates at facility include Kevin Skaith - who was caught in possession of 120,000 child sex images .

Scroll down for video . 40-Year-Old Virgins: A new British documentary follows Clive as he flies to the U.S. to meet Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a surrogate sexual partner whose work inspired last year's Oscar-nominated film, The Sessions . Mrs Cohen-Greene, who makes approximately $50,000 a year, helps Clive to face his fears of intimacy during the documentary,  which airs on . Britain's Channel 4 on Thursday, . She explained to the New York Post that ten percent of her clients are academics, or career-focused virgins who failed to concentrate on their love lives. 'They’re like ""Oh my God, I don’t want to come across as inexperienced,""; she said. '[The virgins] finally say, ""Life is too short. I’ve got to go into surrogate therapy.""' 40-Year-Old Virgins also follows 29-year-old virgin Rosie, . who dreams of marriage and children, but can't bear to be touched by . men. Rosie, who thinks men smell like 'a . cross between aftershave and ham', is seen working with her own . surrogate partner, 55-year-old Gary, an ex-professional tennis player . turned counsellor. 'If you want the job done, get an expert' She is determined to lose her virginity and says of her mission: 'If you want the job done, get an expert.' Channel 4's chief creative officer, Jay Hunt, said of the documentary: 'It's heart-warming. I've never seen anything like it. 'They talk in detail about what it's like to have never had any sexual contact with anybody.' Thanks to The Sessions, a real-life story about . the late polio sufferer Mark O’Brien and his sex surrogate, Ms . Cohen-Greene, several other real-life 'sex surrogates' have opened up about their controversial profession. Shy virgin: Paying $300 for a two-hour session, Clive engages in multiple sex acts with Mrs Cohen-Greene, before he has intercourse for the first time after a fortnight of her radical sex therapy . Sex therapy: The documentary, set to air on Britain's Channel 4 on Thursday, also follows 29-year-old virgin Rosie as she works with her sexual 'surrogate', Gary, 55 . Fern Arden, the founder of a private . clinic close to Manhattan's Central Park West, is a sex therapist who . provides treatment for psychosexual problems. Her female staff of 'surrogate partners' give clients, mostly 40-something virgins, one-on-one coaching in 'caressing techniques, kissing, feeling relaxed with another person in the nude and, inevitably, the sex act itself,' according to the New York Post. The film 40-year-old Virgin may have . been a successful comedy of errors, however for these professionals, it . is no laughing matter with overwhelming embarrassment and shyness . crippling their self-esteem. Ms Arden, who has a Ph.D from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, explained: 'The focus is not sex, but familiarity and intimacy. We provide an . environment, not for sexual pleasure, but for sexual learning. 'People tend to be ill-informed about . what a surrogate partner does. They think of it pejoratively, the same . as a sex worker, but it’s not,' she added. 'Just as you have legitimate massage therapists and people who run massage parlors, there is a huge difference between them.' Ms Arden charges clients between $3,000 and . $5,000 for an average course of 12 to 15 sessions, some with herself, and some with the surrogate. Today there are 30 sex surrogates registered in the U.S. under the International Professional Surrogates Association. Surrogates must complete a two-week training program with the society to become registered, and they mus also work for a licensed sex therapist. Not everyone is convinced of the practice's legality, or ethics, however. Sex surrogates: Since the release of The . Sessions, real-life 'surrogates' have opened up about their profession . One-on-one coaching: Sex surrogates help with . caressing techniques, kissing, feeling relaxed with another person while . naked with sex itself . Derrelle Janey, a defense attorney at the Manhattan law firm Gottleib and Gordon, believes a sex surrogate is much the same as professional prostitution. He said: 'It doesn’t matter if the client is disabled, it doesn’t matter if he is suffering from some kind of emotional distress - that just makes it kind of sad. They have agreed to pay money for a sexual experience, and everyone understands that’s the transaction. In my view, that’s prostitution.' However Ms Arden, who founded the Abel 2 Counseling Center 22 years ago, and is not a member of the International Professional Surrogates Association, insists it is purely a public service. Ms Arden’s staff have 'college degrees' and are 'professionally trained clinicians' who report to her after each session, with take place in the center's offices, she says. Based on a true story: The Sessions, about late . polio sufferer Mark O'Brien and his sex surrogate, Cheryl Cohen-Greene, . aims to shed light on the profession . 'You would typically need a partner to resolve most sexual problems and for single men that is obviously an issue. Most of the men who come to my center are sexually inexperienced, so the surrogate program allows them to progress with their treatment.' She continued: 'People have this perception of a sex surrogate as: ""Oh wow, I am going to have a sexual teacher and we’re going to have hot sex!"" but it’s not that way at all. 'The sessions with the surrogate evolve gradually. It’s a very gradual, sensual process of getting used to holding hands, caressing and kissing. [The clients] could come into treatment for several visits before they even take their clothes off.' Mrs Cohen-Greene agreed, saying: 'I look at our work like this: If you go to a prostitute, it’s like going to a restaurant. You read the menu, you choose what you want, they prepare, they hope that you love it, and hopefully you want to come back. 'With a surrogate, it’s like going to cooking school. You get the ingredients, you learn to make a meal together - and then the point is to go out into the world and share that and not come back.' Ms Arden’s 'surrogate partners' are required to be tested for STDs at least once every two months, as are the clients. Sarah, one of the center's surrogates whose background is in sexual psychology and social work, said: 'I usually begin sessions by working on eye contact and the way they hold their bodies. 'We use massage and touch therapy, so the client can learn to be in the moment, be comfortable with their bodies and become aware of the sensations. 'We take a mind-and-body approach and slowly remove anxiety out of the equation.' She would not comment on whether she had penetrative sex with her clients, however.

Prince Philip was back to his devilish best as he joked with an 83-year-old factory worker about her talent for 'stripping'. The Queen’s 91-year-old husband proved he still has a twinkle in his eye as he indulged in a string of double entendres with Audrey Cook, who has worked at the at the Mars factory in Slough for 69 years. Mrs Cook explained that when she first joined as a 14-year-old girl in 1944 she was employed in the stripping department where the original Mars bars were cut by hand. The Duke of Edinburgh indulged in some typically risqué banter about stripping while visiting the Mars factory . Happy: The Queen looked radiant in a striking purple coat as she received flowers from well-wishers outside . 'Stripping department? That’s Mars bars?' Philip enquired. 'I thought it was something else!' Undeterred the factory’s longest-serving staff member told him innocently: 'It was all done by hand then.' To which the flirty nonagenarian replied: 'Well, most stripping is done by hand.' Fortunately he managed to spend the rest of the morning visit engaged in slightly less risqué conversation. The Duke of Edinburgh is fond of bantering with well-wishers and last year got into a spot of bother when he spied upon pretty council worker Hannah Jackson, 25, on a Jubilee visit with his wife to Bromley in Kent. The elderly royal turned to the policeman standing next to her and gestured towards her eye-catching red dress which had a zip running the length of its front. 'I would get arrested if I unzipped that dress!' he exclaimed. At the time, his comments were widely greeted as yet another 'gaffe', for which the Duke of Edinburgh has become notorious. Most recently, the Duke hit the headlines when he told a Filipino nurse that her country must be 'half empty as you're all here running the NHS' while on a visit to a Luton hospital. Hale and hearty: Both the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen were on top form and looked in good health . Community: The Queen and Prince Phillip also unveiled a plaque at Slough's Britwell community centre . Gift: A smiling Queen is handed a pink rose by a little girl during her visit to  Slough's Britwell community centre . Greatest hits include asking an Oban driving instructor how he managed to keep locals off the booze long enough to pass the test, and telling the president of Nigeria that his traditional robes made him look ready for bed. Phillip made his latest remarks during a tour of the Mars factory in Berkshire, home to the eponymous Mars Bars, Snickers and other delights, with the Queen. Before they left the Queen was presented with a remarkable edible carriage - a replica of the Irish state coach - made from chocolate, sugar and 24-carat gold leaf. Mars' president, Fiona Dawson, told the monarch: 'It's the first time we've had gold leaf in one of our products. I hope it doesn't take off otherwise it might be expensive to make.' The Queen appeared pleased with her gift which also featured an edible painting of Windsor Castle complete with a gold frame and two M&Ms dressed as guardsmen standing to attention in chocolate sentry boxes, complete with bearskins, guarding the rear of the picture. As she stepped forward for a closer look, the monarch said: 'Yes, very clever, it's rather detailed isn't it?' The Queen pointed out the 7lb chocolate carriage, which took two weeks to make and will last for about a month (not that it is likely to hang around that long) to Philip who said to Miss Dawson: 'You expect it to be eaten or kept?'

'It is very difficult at all to see how it is possible to become . immensely valuable by singing what I think are the most hideous songs.' 'You managed not to get eaten then?' To a British student who was trekking in Papua New Guinea, during an official visit in 1998. 'I would like to go to Russia very much — although the bastards murdered half my family.' In 1967, when asked if he would like to visit the Soviet Union. 'All money nowadays seems to be produced . with a natural homing instinct for the Treasury.' Lamenting the rate of .

From international leaders to film stars and royalty, the Royal Yacht Britannia has seen more glamorous occasions than most. But since retiring to a quiet mooring in Edinburgh, the glittering occasions have been thin on the ground. That, however, is all about to change. For the ship's 60th anniversary, visitors will be invited to come aboard dressed in the glamorous finery of the 50s - the decade when the ship was launched. Glamour: During her 696 visits to far flung climes, Britannia has seen more than her fair share of glitz . Halcyon days: The ship was launched on the 16th April 1953 but her maiden voyage was the following year . The vintage fashion parade will take place on the 13th and 14th April, and will kick off a week of celebrations, during which ship-goers will have the chance to win some suitably sophisticated pink Britannia champagne. Along with champagne, there will also be a birthday cake to enjoy, and the week of celebration will culminate in a fireworks display over the harbour on the 20th April. Britannia was launched by the Queen on 16th April 1953 but didn't officially come into service until the 11th January the following year. The ship's maiden voyage took her from Portsmouth to the capital of Malta, Valetta, arriving on the 22nd April 1954. On board were Princess Anne and Prince Charles who visited Valetta before going onto Tobruk in Libya, where they were joined by the Queen and Prince Philip at the end of the royal couple's Commonwealth Tour.

During her career, Britannia clocked up 696 foreign visits and 272 visits in British . waters, steaming a grand total of 1,087,623 nautical miles . (2,014,278 km) over 44 years. The yacht was also intended to be a refuge for the Queen in the case of a nuclear attack, according to historian, Peter Hennessy. 'It was her floating nuclear bunker,' he revealed. 'It would lurk in the sea lochs on the north-west coast of Scotland; the mountains would shield it from the Soviet radar and at night it would go quietly from one sea loch to another.' Britannia was eventually decommissioned in 1997 under the Tony Blair government, much to the distress of the Queen who famously shed a rare public tear as she waved the yacht goodbye. Now moored in Edinburgh's Port of Leith, the yacht has become a hugely popular tourist attraction, bringing in upwards of 250,000 visitors a year.

She was said to be a 'happy, lively and optimistic person who lived life to the full'. At the hearing, pathologist Dr Mark Lord was questioned about Cathy's immune system. He replied: 'It's not a defect. It's the immune system being super efficient in the destruction of the virus but the heart muscle is destroyed as well.'

Myocarditis is a viral infection that leads to inflammation and damage to the heart. The majority of cases clear up within a week, but sometimes the inflammation in the heart lasts longer. Symptoms include chest pain, fever, an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath. There’s no reason why someone with an infection may develop myocarditis - it is often a case of bad luck. Many people don’t realise it, but common bacterial and viral infections such as flu, ear and chest infections, and even the common cold can get into the bloodstream and affect the heart, explains consultant cardiologist Dr Nigel Durham of York Hospital. ‘It’s more widespread than we’d thought  - a quarter of patients we see aged 30 to 35 have evidence of myocarditis, and it is the most common cause of sudden adult death. Myocarditis can be mild and sometimes resolves itself - if the condition is spotted quickly, anti-inflammatory drugs can treat it. But once the heart muscle becomes enlarged, causing it to stretch, there is little that can be done and it can lead to heart failure.","Catherine Hall, 23, fell ill with symptoms similar to norovirus last December .

Then log on to borrowmydoggy.com, which allows you to look after someone else's. The site matches owners who don't have time to walk their pet with dog lovers who don't have the space to keep one of their own. Dogs are available across the country and it’s free to register at the moment - though charges will be introduced later this year. When they sign up, borrowers give details of their experience with dogs, the amount of time they have and upload a picture of themselves. Borrowmydoggy.com allows you to look after someone else's dog for a while . The owners write a profile about their pet and whether they want it walked, looked after at home or groomed. To ensure nothing goes wrong, the site carries out detailed checks on borrowers (such as making sure the name and address given match). The site also recommends that borrower and owner email, talk on the phone and meet up somewhere public before the dog is borrowed. Rikke Rosenlund, 38, came up with the idea when walking a friend’s dog. 'I love dogs, but I don’'t think it would be fair to have one in my London flat. Walking someone else's is the perfect compromise. Some owners are busy working or travel a lot and want to avoid paying for a dog walker,' she says. 'Others have had a baby or been diagnosed with an illness so no longer have as much time for their dog.' The site allows users who have a dog but no time to walk it with dog lovers who can't keep animals in their homes . The project has proven so popular that Rikke has since given up her job to run the site. One enthusiastic borrower is Katie Hampshire, 24, from High Wickham, Kent, who borrows cross-breed Rosie. 'Her owner is a teacher and wanted Rosie to get out more. I text when I have free time and take her for walks. It’s great,' she says.

One weaves fantasies perhaps and, with time, those thoughts and images become entrenched as facts. But as we know, the past can creep up and surprise us with the revelation that it really wasn’t like that at all. My father has always been a dark room in my inner life — one for which I could never find the light switch. He left our comfortable suburban home in 1959, when I was four, having peremptorily announced to my mother that he was leaving her, me and my baby sister for his secretary. Deceit: Four-year-old Rupert, right, and family pose for a photographer on the day father Michael walked out . My mother claimed later she had no inkling this was about to happen, and she certainly never altogether recovered from the shock of his betrayal. The strangest detail of this story is that, on the day he left, my father commissioned a photographer to take some pictures he could remember us by. I have a vivid memory of this interesting stranger with a flash camera, clicking away as I was watching the TV over Sunday teatime, eating chocolate cake off the best crockery. But I have no memory of what followed: of my father’s departure and absence, of the tears, grief, fear and anger that must have accompanied them, I can recover no trace. All I know of this epoch in my life is what my mother later told me: that for a few months after his bunk, my father, Michael, occasionally came back to see my sister and me at weekends. But being a busy and ambitious journalist, with a senior position on the Daily Mirror (eventually he became its editor), other things seemed to take priority. 'It wasn't that I hated him: he was merely a void. I don't think I would even have recognised him had I passed him on the street' One day, he left me waiting outside Sunday school for an hour beyond the appointed time, and my enraged mother told him that if he couldn’t come when he said he would, then he had better not come at all. ‘He scuttled off like a frightened rabbit,’ she added. He died in 1983, nearly half a century later, but that was the last I saw of him. Children of the age of four, five, six must have strategies for coping with this sort of trauma that no psychoanalyst can ever excavate. In my case, this involved an oath of blind loyalty to my mother and a total obliteration of my father. As the song has it, I simply washed that man right out of my hair and forgot about him — at what cost to my emotional development I can never calculate. It was the easy way out, but in the short-term effective. I was an anxious, timid child, but a reasonably functioning one, with a secure domestic environment, my mother’s love, friends of my own age and a degree of academic success to buttress me. Sometimes my father sent a birthday or Christmas present; sometimes he didn’t. His final effort came on my 11th birthday in 1965, when he sent me a Gillette Techmatic razor — a gadget I found utterly inexplicable, not least because my pre-pubescent chin was stubble-free. My mother was furious at my father’s lack of sensitivity and I guess she made her rage known to him. In any case, he never sent anything ever again, either to me or my sister, and that was that. Throughout my teenage and early adult years, I was repeatedly urged by well-meaning parties, at school and at home, to seek out my father — and my mother nobly made it clear I had her licence to do so — but I never wanted anything to do with him. Rupert and his sister share a rare moment with their father: He became a stranger to them as they grew up . It wasn’t that I hated him: he was merely a void. I don’t think I would even have recognised him had I passed him on the street, except that once, in my mid-20s, I had been flicking idly through a book of David Bailey’s photographs when my eye alighted on a face I felt was vaguely familiar. Only when I looked down at the caption did I realise it was my father. And I laughed. The news he had died at the wheel of his car after suffering a stroke left me entirely indifferent, except to wonder whether he had left me any money (eventually I received a small yield on a life insurance policy). I did not go to his funeral: my mother thought it would be more tactful to send flowers, but I was at a loss as to how to sign the card. Daddy, Dad, Pop, Father, Pater, You bastard? I didn’t even have a name for him. To this day I do not know where his grave is or even whether he has one. The turning point for me came long after his death. When my paternal grandmother died at a venerable age, her house was cleared out and my cousin found a stash of letters my father had written home when he was evacuated to the U.S. during the war. 'Suddenly, I found the switch for the light in that dark inner room, and felt compelled to find out more about this man' My cousin, with whom I had stayed in distant contact, thoughtfully sent them to me, rather than to the son of my father’s second marriage, and for that gesture I am profoundly indebted to her. Reading these letters was a revelation. Only 13 when he left England, 15 when he returned, my father emerges from these wafer-thin, impeccably typed sheets as prematurely sophisticated and a precocious master of prose. Billeted in the suburb of New Canaan, Connecticut, he was sent to a private school, where he had a marvellous time posing as an eccentric Englishman, editing the school magazine and appearing in productions of The Importance Of Being Earnest and Charley’s Aunt, as well as trying to win the affections of the prettiest girls. But one can also sense his emotional resemblance to his fictional contemporary Holden Caulfield in The Catcher In The Rye — someone forced to grow up unnaturally fast, concealing his anxieties behind a mask of wit and nonchalance. The thing that shocked and thrilled me above all, however, was the discovery of a passage that explained why he had sent that razor. It comes in a letter dated February 1941, when my father was still 13. ‘The shaving so far has been moderate,’ he tells his parents. ‘Once every three weeks, I cut off the rapidly stiffening stubble. The razor is a beauty, a Gillette, and there is no shortage of blades.’ It was clearly a sensitive issue. Then, in April 1942, he reported that for his 15th birthday he had received from his younger sister ‘20 razor blades, as I had used up my first packet of Gillette blades’. ‘My son will never be advised not to shave,’ he continued, ‘providing he has something worth cutting off. I have now been shaving for 16 months, and I still only have to shave every two weeks, whereas one would imagine from the pre-razor period that I would be getting up ten minutes earlier every morning to shave stiff bristles by now.’ Moved on: Only now, decades on and after his father's death, has Rupert forgiven him . So there it was: a gift that had seemed indifferent or callous was intended as a blessing — a clumsy attempt at a father-and-son thing, a remotely controlled push through a rite of passage that finally made sense to me after nearly half a century. Suddenly, I found the switch for the light in that dark inner room, and felt compelled to find out more about this man who had bequeathed me half my genes. I found the courage to contact some of his Mirror colleagues, who generously shared their reminiscences. I was fascinated to realise that even people who had worked with him closely for years were entirely unaware of the existence of his first family. I also tracked down my half–sister, whom I had never met. Life being an ironic business, it transpired she lived near my South London home and we had probably been passing each other in the aisles of Sainsbury’s for years. Did we bond? Not really. But at least our 15-minute cup of coffee cleared the fetid air. Most tellingly, my father made his first appearance in my dreams. My sister and I were driving a clapped-out Ford Anglia down long country lanes with high hedgerows. At the dead end of the road was a vast spreading oak — a tree of the ages, exuding wisdom and strength and calm. Under its benign shadow, like Job in Blake’s painting, stood my father, in a suit and tie, smiling and expectant. As I got out of the car and moved to greet him, he fell to his knees and I realised he was barefoot. I don’t know quite how to interpret this strange tableau, but it feels as though something has healed. Rupert Christiansen’s book I Know You’re Going To Be Happy (Short Books, £12.99).

A 20-year-old has been diagnosed with a rare stomach disorder after dropping from a size 12 to a size four in the space of a year. Sophie Mattes lived on just a handful of boiled sweets and three squares of chocolate a day leading doctors to assume that she had an eating disorder. However, Sophie, who weighed nine stone before falling ill, insisted she was not suffering from an eating disorder and begged doctors to believe she was not anorexic. In fact, she claimed she was desperate to eat more but felt constantly full and bloated despite her meagre diet. Only her parents believed she was telling the truth and, after insisting on more tests, Sophie was finally diagnosed with gastroparesis, a condition that meant the nerve that emptied her stomach was paralysed. Sophie was immediately admitted to hospital and tube fed before finally having a pacemaker fitted to her stomach to allow her to start eating again. Sophie, from Edgware, Middlesex, said: ‘It was awful having nobody believe I was ill. Because I was a teenage girl losing weight quickly people just assumed I was anorexic. ‘The doctors were convinced I had an eating disorder and even tried to persuade my mum I needed help. ‘Even strangers in the street would make horrible comments about me being anorexic and tell me to eat. It was devastating. ‘Thank goodness mum and dad believed me when I told them I didn’t have an eating disorder. Mum pushed for more tests but it was still another six months before I was diagnosed. ‘It’s frustrating that any young woman losing weight is labelled anorexic.’ Sophie, a barista in a coffee shop, had a healthy appetite until she turned 18 and started struggling to finish her meals. ‘It felt like it was getting stuck in my throat and after eating I’d get stabbing pains in my stomach and feel sick,’ she explained. Scroll down for video . Sophie (pictured with her parents, Simon and Laura, and her siblings) insisted that she was not anorexic despite her dramatic weight loss . Sophie was eventually diagnosed with gastroparesis and had to be tube fed in hospital for three weeks . Soon she felt full after just a few mouthfuls of food. ‘I wanted to eat but couldn’t so I would just pick at my meals. But even that left me uncomfortable. ‘I saw my GP a few times but they just told me to eat more and sent me away with bottles of Gaviscon.’ Eventually it became too painful to finish her meals and Sophie was surviving on boiled sweets and chocolate. Sophie's condition means that the nerve which is meant to empty her stomach is paralysed . Sophie was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead where she was fed through a tube to help her put on weight . ‘I was serving people delicious cakes . and sandwiches all day at work and wanted nothing more than to eat . myself but I knew it would leave me in agony. ‘Only every time I want back to the doctor they said there was nothing wrong with me,’ she said. Seeing their daughter waste away, Sophie’s worried parents Simon Mattes, 46, Laura Mattes, 43, insisted on taking her back to their GP again. This time, Mrs Mattes was taken aside and the doctor told her Sophie was most likely suffering from an eating disorder. Before being admitted to hospital Sophie was surviving on a few boiled sweets and a small amount of chocolate each day . She was released from hospital after three weeks but still had to be tube fed for 14 hours a day at home . Sophie said: ‘I could hear the words . being whispered to my mum and was shocked and angry because I had . already told them I didn’t have an eating disorder. ‘But people see a teenage girl losing weight and that is all they think. It’s a lazy assumption to make.’ Thankfully Sophie’s mother and father believed their daughter and pushed for a referral. Even after being discharged from hospital Sophie was unable to eat normally without suffering from pain and sickness . Sophie said: ‘I was gutted when the . first round of tests and scans came back clear and I feared that was it, . everyone would be sure I was anorexic now. ‘My weight was dropping faster than ever and I looked horrific.’ But . Sophie’s parents persisted and more tests at the Royal Free Hospital in . Hampstead in April 2012 finally revealed that she had the stomach . condition gastroparesis. It meant her stomach was not emptying efficiently explaining why she felt constantly bloated and full. Sophie said: ‘Having an answer was such a relief. At last people had to believe I did not have an eating disorder. They finally knew I had been telling the truth all along.’ In September 2012, with her weight below six stone, Sophie was admitted back to the Royal Free and put on feeding tube for almost three weeks. Even when she was well enough to be discharged, Sophie had to be tube fed via her nose at home for 14 hours a day. ‘It was horrible, the machine was inside a backpack but it made a really loud humming noise all the time,’ she said. She gained weight but was still unable to eat normally without suffering pain and sickness. ‘I begged me specialist for an answer and he mentioned a gastric pacemaker. I’d heard of pacemakers before but not for the stomach,’ she added. Medics explained it would help pump the food from her stomach into her intestines. Sophie (pictured, right, with her mother Laura) had a pacemaker fitted to her stomach and can now eat normally again . Slowly, after the operation at the end of October 2012, her appetite returned. ‘After a year of not eating it hurt so I took lots of painkillers and built up slowly to a few forks of pasta at a time,’ she said. Now, six months after the operation, she can eat a small plate of food and continues to gain weight. She now weighs 7st 10 and is a size six to eight. ‘I want to warn that not all young women losing weight are anorexic, please don’t be too quick to label us when there really could be a serious health problem that has nothing to do with eating disorders. ‘Believe me, I would like nothing more than to be a curvy size 12 again,’ she said. Gastroparesis is a chronic condition which means the stomach cannot empty itself of food normally. Symptoms include feeling sick or full when eating, bloating and weight loss. It is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles that control the emptying of the stomach. The cause of the problem is usually unknown but it is most common among people with poorly managed diabetes. It is also associated with some medications, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.","Sophie Mattes, 20, dropped from a size 12 to a size four in just a year .

The controversial NHS 111 hotline service will go live in only one area of England tomorrow after grave concerns were voiced about its safety. The advice line is designed to be a cheaper replacement for NHS Direct - with . non-emergency callers with health problems being giving guidance on . whether they should visit their GP or attend a hospital. Already in operation in 22 NHS . regions, 111 is due to ‘go live’ across the North of Tyne and Tees . area tomorrow, and in a further 13 areas over the coming month. The initial plan had been to roll it out nationwide today, but doctors had repeatedly warned lives could be at . risk. Delayed: The new NHS 111 hotline service will go live in only one area of England tomorrow after grave concerns were voiced about its safety . Last week the British Medical Association wrote to the head of the NHS, Sir David . Nicholson, urging him to delay the  full national roll-out of the . 111 service. Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA’s GP Committee, said: ‘We . cannot sacrifice patient safety to meet a political deadline.’ A cornerstone of the BMA's argument is that those taking the calls do not need to be medically trained at . all, and instead work through computer check lists as callers tell them . their symptoms. They may then be referred to speak on the phone with . nurses or doctors if necessary. Last night a spokesman for NHS England, . the body managing the NHS 111 service’s introduction, said: ‘This is a . very important service for the public and we will make sure everything . is in place to make a safe, high quality service that patients and the . public can trust. ‘Many . sites are already up and running, but in areas where NHS 111 is not yet . available we will make a thorough assessment of readiness before new . sites are introduced. ‘The . public can be assured the areas that already have NHS 111 will continue . this service. In those areas where NHS 111 is not yet in place they can . ring NHS Direct on 0845 46 47. All GP surgeries also have messages . advising what to do.’ The initial plan had been to roll the service out nationwide today, but doctors had repeatedly warned lives could be at risk . NHS Direct was launched in 1998 to provide medical advice round the . clock in an attempt to reduce the number of patients needlessly turning . up in A&E. The idea is the new service combines the long-running NHS Direct helpline with local emergency out-of-hours services. NHS bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with . out-of-hours telephone services for GP surgeries will make it easier for . patients to get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends. They will be put through to a call centre worker who will decide if they . need to go to A&E, a GP clinic, a chemist or can get by with . over-the-phone advice. The operator can potentially send out an ambulance, put someone straight . through to a nurse, book an out-of-hours GP appointment, or direct the . caller to a pharmacist or dentist. In some areas of the country the new service will be run by private . firms while in others it will be overseen by NHS ambulance services. But the BMA has also warned that the service is being ‘run on the cheap’ with far higher proportions of untrained workers than nurses. Mess: Fears about the state of the service in trial areas have been reported, with some people kept waiting for hours . Staff have been recruited for as . little as £8 per hour to man the phone lines. Job adverts suggest they . require no medical experience but should have telesales experience and . typing skills. While nurses represented around 36 per cent of staff at NHS Direct, they . only comprise around 17 per cent of the NHS 111 workforce. As well as claims of potentially fatal conditions being missed, there have already been reports of ambulances being sent to people with hiccups. Some patients using limited 111 pilot schemes are already waiting . several hours for urgent medical advice, while others have been told to . phone back the following day because there is no one available to talk . to them.","Advice hotline designed to be a cheaper replacement for NHS Direct .

British children are in need of personalised weight loss programmes to combat an obesity epidemic, a public health watchdog has warned. The body said that advertising for unhealthy snacks and confectionary should be banned on children's television to help the UK's 1.3million obese children lose weight. Public Health England also suggested that councils should be given the power to formulate health programmes to 'deal with this problem head on'. The agency, which started operations yesterday, has a wide-ranging remit to 'protect and improve the nation's health and wellbeing'. British children are in need of personalised weight loss programmes to combat an obesity epidemic, according to the new watchdog Public Health England . Professor Kevin Fenton, the agency's Director of Health Improvement and Population Healthcare, said that authorities should use 'local individual plans' as part of a 'range of effective tools' to combat obesity. He suggested that restaurants should also reduce portion sizes for children and promote healthier food. Professor Fenton said that information on pupils' height and weight, which is already collected by schools and passed to the Department of Health, could be utilised more effectively. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'Innovation can be put in place at the local level when local councils understand the nature of the epidemic and take steps to help to intervene.' Recent figures show that a tenth of British children are obese when they start school, while twice many are obese when starting senior school. Overall, a third of children are overweight or obese by the time they are in their final year at primary school. In 2011/12, 9.5 per cent of children in reception class aged four and five were classed as obese, rising to one in five pupils in year six aged ten and 11. Fuelling the epidemic is a lack of attention from parents, with almost half of parents whose children are obese wrongly stating that their children were 'about the right weight'. The watchdog also suggested that councils should be given the power to formulate health programmes to deal with obesity head on . A recent Department of Health briefing suggested that current obesity rates are worse, with 22 per cent of four to five-year-olds classed as obese and 34 per cent of 10 to 11-year-olds. Referring to Britain's 'obesogenic environment', Professor Fenton said: 'It is about being mindful about what we are offering to our kids and ensuring we are looking at portion control and healthier options in schools, pubs or community - all of us have a role to play. Speaking about a potential ban on unhealthy food adverts on children's television, he added: 'Are we ensuring that we don't have access to unhealthy TV adverts at a time when kids are watching television. Should we be thinking about how those advertisements are being placed? 'In other countries they have delinked advertisements which promote toys and food, adverts that promote kids coming into restaurant establishments, that is one of the options that is being looked at.' The warning comes shortly after doctors claimed that parents are creating a 'cancer timebomb' by letting their children spend too long sitting down. The experts also claimed that children are being put at risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes because of their sedentary lifestyles.","Public Health England says children need personalised weight loss programmes to combat obesity epidemic .

A new strain of deadly bird flu has killed four people in China and a total of 11 people have contracted the H7N9 virus. The deadly strain, previously . unknown in people, has begun to mutate into a form more likely to cause a . human pandemic, scientists say. Chinese authorities are studying the dangerous strain, as Japan and Hong Kong have stepped up vigilance against the virus and Vietnam has banned imports of Chinese poultry. Scroll down for video . A nurse attends to patients being treated on drips in a hospital in Shanghai. The city has activated an emergency response plan following four deaths of the strain of bird flu . A 48-year-old man who worked in poultry transportation in the eastern province of Jiangsu died in a hospital in the nearby city of Shanghai . A strain bird flu in China appears to have mutated so that it can spread to other animals, raising the potential for a bigger threat to people . The H7N9 bird flu strain does not appear to be transmitted from human to human but authorities in Hong Kong raised a preliminary alert and are taking precautions at their airport. In Japan, airports have put up posters at entry points warning all passengers from China to seek medical attention if they suspect they have bird flu. A total of 11 people in China have been confirmed to have contracted H7N9, all in the east of the country. A 48-year-old man who delivers poultry died of the virus in Shanghai today, bringing the number of deaths to four, state media said. Authorities in Shanghai also discovered the H7N9 virus in a pigeon sample taken from a traditional wholesale market, Xinhua added, believed to be the first time the virus has been discovered in a animal in China since the outbreak began. '(China) will strengthen its leadership in combating the virus... and coordinate and deploy the entire nation's health system to combat the virus,' the Health Ministry said in a statement late on Wednesday on its website. An official lets a dog sniff out items of possible quarantine concern at Incheon International Airport in South Korea as health authorities stepped up quarantine measures to fight against a bird flu outbreak in China . Health authorities nationwide are studying the dangerous new strain and preparing isolation units for possible new infections with H7N9 avian influenza . A worker catches chickens at a market in Nanjing, eastern China's Jiangsu province. Flu experts across the world are studying samples isolated from the patients to assess the human pandemic potential of the strain . In Hong Kong, authorities activated the preliminary 'Alert Response Level' under a preparedness plan for an influenza pandemic, which calls for close monitoring of chicken farms, vaccination, culling drills, and a suspension of imports of live birds from the mainland. All passengers on flights in and out of Hong Kong were being asked to notify flight attendants or airport staff if they were feeling unwell. Vietnam said it had banned poultry imports from China, blaming the risk of H7N9 for their clampdown. Just . days after authorities in China announced they had identified cases of . H7N9, flu experts in laboratories across the world are picking through . the DNA sequence data of samples isolated from patients to assess its . severity. Other strains of bird flu, such as H5N1, have been circulating for many years and can be transmitted from bird to bird, and bird to human, but not generally from human to human. 'The gene sequences confirm that this is an avian virus, and that it is a low pathogenic form (meaning it is likely to cause mild disease in birds),' said Wendy Barclay, a flu virologist at Britain's Imperial College London. 'But what the sequences also reveal is that there are some mammalian adapting mutations in some of the genes.' Poultry is displayed for sale at a stall in a market, in Hanoi, Vietnam. The country has banned imports of Chinese poultry and other countries have quickly introduced procedures to try and keep the strain out . A Chinese vendor holds up a black chicken, often used in herbal soup, for sale in a poultry stall in a market in Beijing. The country reported its fourth death from H7N9 avian influenza today . Vietnam has banned Chinese poultry imports after China reported eleven human cases of the mutant strain . This, she said, meant the H7N9 virus has already acquired some of the genetic changes it would need to mutate into a form that could be transmitted from person to person. In Beijing, the Health Ministry said the government would swiftly communicate details of the new strain to the outside world and its own people, following complaints it had been too slow to report on the outbreak and suspicion of a cover-up. Chinese internet users and some newspapers have questioned why it took so long for the government to announce the new cases, especially as two of the victims fell ill in February. The government has said it needed time to correctly identify the virus. In 2003, authorities initially tried to cover up an epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China and killed about 10 percent of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide. While the official Xinhua news agency said it was unfair to compare SARS with H7N9, as the new bird flu virus had yet to show signs of human-to-human transmission, it did warn that the government's credibility was on the line. 'If there is anything that SARS has taught China and its government, it's that one cannot be too careful or too honest when it comes to deadly pandemics. 'The last 10 years have taught the government a lot, but it is far from enough,' it said in a commentary.","Latest victim of H7N9 virus 48-year-old man who delivers poultry .

Supermarkets are on alert for pranksters attempting to copy an American craze known as 'gallon smashing', after one teenager was arrested for the stunt last week. The prank involves a youngster walking into a crowded shop, before slamming a large carton of milk into the ground and lying down. Store workers are tricked into thinking there has been an accident. An accomplice meanwhile films the incident and posts the video online. One such incident, titled 'Gallon Smashing Prank, UK Edition' has already attracted 1.12million viewers after it was posted online.

Aisle help you: The trickster lands right next to a shop worker in this 'gallon smashing' incident . An American version showing three teenagers performing the prank, went viral earlier this year. There are now fears the fad has gained popularity on this side of the Atlantic, with police in Kent confirming they have attended calls on 'gallon smashing' incidents. Last week, a teenager pulled the messy stunt in a Poundland store in Canterbury. But the practical joke turned sour when staff called the police and the culprit was reprimanded. One shopper, who hinted on Twitter that they witnessed the incident, said: 'Children in this city are out of control. I hate them all. What is wrong with them? 'When I finished a term at school, I went straight home to change into my own clothes. These days, kids want to terrorise retail staff. 'They're all stealing things and throwing bottles of milk around.' A spokesman for Kent Police confirmed they had dealt with the incident which 'involved a container of milk'. He said: 'Police were called to a shop in St George's Street, Canterbury, at around 5.20pm on March 28 after staff reported a disturbance involving a container of milk. 'A boy in his teens was spoken to and investigations are ongoing.' No laughing matter: A teenager who carried out the prank at Poundland in Canterbury was arrested . One youngster thought to be involved in the prank, tweeted: 'Gonna gallon smash in Poundland,' before later posting the message, 'Biggest mistake ever'.

Rick Warren's youngest son, Matthew, has committed suicide at the age of 27 after a long battle with depression. The Orange County Sheriff Coroner's . office told the MailOnline that the estimated time of death was Friday . at 10am and said he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The evangelical pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California revealed his son's death to his church on Saturday. 'No words can express the anguished grief we feel right now,' the pastor told his congregation in a statement, pleading for their prayers as the family mourned. Loss: Rick Warren's son Matthew committed suicide on Friday at the age of 27, after a long battle with depression . Family: Kay and Rick Warren have two other adult children, Amy and Joshua. Kay Warren is active in her husband's ministry . The distraught father revealed in a statement that Matthew had struggled with mental illness from a young age, experiencing 'dark holes of depression, and even suicidal thoughts.' Despite countless doctors and medication, 'the torture of mental illness never subsided.' 'Kay and I often marveled at his courage to keep moving in spite of relentless pain. I'll never forget how, many years ago, after another approach had failed to give relief, Matthew said ""Dad, I know I¹m going to heaven. Why can't I just die and end this pain?"" but he kept going for another decade,' the grieving pastor continued. Rick Warren is married to Kay, who is active in her husband's ministry, and they have two other adult children, Amy and Joshua, and five grandchildren. The pastor remembered his youngest child for his 'brilliant intellect and a gift for sensing who was most in pain or most uncomfortable in a room.' Tragedy: The youngest son of Rick Warren, the evangelical pastor pictured delivering the invocation at Obama's 2009 inauguration, has committed suicide at the age of 27 . He said that the tragic event occurred after Matthew had spent time with the couple on Thursday. 'In a momentary wave of despair at his home [in Mission Viejo, Calif.], he took his life.' The Coroner's office said that an autopsy would be conducted next week on either Monday or Tuesday. Dr Warren frequently communicates via his Twitter account but did not post any messages on Friday. On Saturday afternoon, he posted this tweet referencing the Lord's Prayer. 'We pray 'Thy WILL be done on earth AS IT IS IN HEAVEN' since in heaven God's will is done #always. On earth, it's done rarely,' seemingly in response to the family's tragic loss. The church said in a statement that they were 'deeply grieved for the loss of Pastor Rick and Kay Warren upon hearing of the death of their youngest son, Matthew.' 'Our church family has had the privilege of ministering together with the Warrens and their family, all of whom have been lifelong members of Saddleback, over the last 33 years.' Politics: Rick Warren hosted the Civil Forum on The Presidency, attended by both Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and then Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) at Saddleback Church in August 2008 during the 2008 presidential election . Christian right: President George W. Bush, with his wife Laura in 2008, receives the International Medal of PEACE from Warren at the Saddleback Civil Forum on Global Health at the Newseum in Washington, DC . Scores of tributes poured in on social media, with supporters posting words of encouragement and prayers to the Saddleback Facebook page. 'Our hearts ache for you. We love you and are holding you close in our prayers. God bless you and give you strength,' one mourner wrote, with another adding, 'Matthew is home, free of all the pain he felt.' 'All I can think is that he wants his parents to have a happy last memory. He's with God and he is whole again.' Megachurch pastor Greg Laurie lost his 33-year-old son in a car crash in 2008 and offered his condolences to the Warren family. 'At times like these, there really are no words, but there is the Word. There is no manual, but there is Emmanuel,' he said in a statement on the Gospel Coalition website. Grieving: Pastor Warren posted this message to his more than 900,000 Twitter followers on Saturday . Warren, 59, is one of the leading voices in the evangelical movement in America. His . church, located in Orange County, is ranked the seventh largest . congregation in the U.S. with an average weekly attendance of 20,000. The Southern Baptist pastor authored the Purpose Driven Life, a devotional study book, that was published in 2002 and became a New York Times bestseller, selling over 32 million copies as it exploded as a popular trend among conservative Christians. He has taken an active role in promoting social justice and even hosted the Civil Forum on The Presidency, attended by both Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and then Sen.

Congregation: Kay and Rick Warren founded the church in 1980 and it has grown into a megachurch, with an average weekly attendance of 20,000 . She has openly discussed her personal struggle with depression and overcoming sexual abuse in her childhood. Though the spiritual leaders never publicly detailed their youngest son's struggle, Kay did tell Christianity Today in an interview last April that 'a loved one was struggling with a mental illness' on the same day that Rick Warren delivered his prayer at Obama's inauguration in 2009. She authored a book about overcoming adversity, Choose Joy: Because Happiness Isn't Enough, about finding victory over despair through faith in Christ.

A 21-year-old has spoken of her shock after she visited her doctor with a cough and was told she needed a heart transplant. Hannah Kelleher returned from holiday in Greece with a cough so bad she decided to see her GP. She was diagnosed with pneumonia, but her GP also discovered her heart was enlarged and beating much too fast. Hannah Kelleher, 21, went to see her doctor suffering from a severe cough. She was diagnosed with pneumonia but doctors also discovered her heart was beating too fast . The office worker from Havant, Hampshire, was told that her heartbeat was 240 beats a minute - the average is between 68 and 90 - so an ambulance was called to rush her to hospital. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscles in the walls of the heart become stiff, so they do not fill with blood normally. Symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations and abdominal enlargement. Up to a third of patients also suffer a complication such as a blood clot. The condition is normally diagnosed based on a physical examination, an ECG and an echocardiogram. Some patients can be treated with pacemakers but heart transplants can be required in severe cases. She said: ‘Doctors told me my heart was twice the size it should be. I was stunned and scared. ‘After a week in hospital doctors were able to treat my pneumonia but my heart wouldn't shrink back to its normal size.’ Ms Kelleher was referred to a specialist who told her she had restrictive cardiomyopathy - a condition where the walls of the heart become rigid and it do not fill with blood properly. Symptoms of the condition, which normally affects people aged over 50, include shortness of breath, tiredness and heart palpitations – Ms Kelleher had all three. Doctors tried to treat the 21-year-old with tablets, but when this failed to help, the only option was for her to have a heart transplant. She was told that she needed to be ready for the operation as soon as a suitable match was found. She was treated for the pneumonia in hospital but her heart failed to improve so she had a heart transplant three weeks later . And just three weeks later, she was told a match had been found. The night before her five-hour operation she sat her family down and went through her funeral plans. However, the operation was a success and after spending almost four weeks recovering in hospital she was able to go home. Ms Kelleher said: ‘I got a call at 7.30am from the hospital saying they may have found a match. ‘I didn't think it was going to happen. But after they did some checks they found it was a perfect match. Ms Kelleher received a heart from a 48-year-old woman who had died . She has written to the donor's family to thank them for saving her life and is now encouraging more people to join the organ donor register . ‘I was only told 15 minutes before the operation it was definitely going ahead. ‘My mum and dad went to the hospital with me and they were really nervous too. ‘Luckily it was a success - but without a doubt pneumonia saved my life. She added: ‘I was always quite skinny and would feel sick after exercise, but I just put it down to something else. ‘Since my transplant I've been going to the gym and not feeling sick after exercising.’ Ms Kelleher now believes that developing pneumonia saved her life . Since her heart transplant, Ms Kelleher is able to exercise without feeling sick or dizzy . Ms Kelleher is now urging more people to get information about becoming an organ donor. She said: ‘After discovering I'd got my heart from a woman of 48, I wrote to her family to thank them. ‘I thank her and her family for what they have done.’ Trish Collins, of south central organ donation team for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: ‘With heart donors, you don't really have an age limit as it's more to do with health issues. ‘For people that do carry a donor card, we would recommend they discuss this with their families. ‘We can't stress the importance of people signing up to the register. ‘You can save up to the lives of nine people by donating your liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart, lungs and small bowel. You can also donate tissue.’ For more information on organ donation: www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ .","Hannah Kelleher, 21, went to the doctor suffering from a severe cough .

Marks & Spencer is reeling from a strategy disaster of poor-quality clothes aimed at the wrong customers, critics have warned, as the store prepares to register a slump in fashion sales. Fashion-watchers, rivals and shoppers insisted the group needed to abandon cheap products and aim squarely at Britain’s aspiring middle-class women or risk losing ground. Chief executive Marc Bolland is likely to face calls from shareholders for quicker action to stop the rot, as forecasters expect the group to report quarterly sales down 4.5 per cent. Trouble brewing: Marc Bolland, Chief Executive of British retailer Marks and Spencer, at the opening of the store at Westfield Stratford City . The dip will be the sharpest since Bolland took the helm three years ago. ‘Where M&S has gone wrong is that they have tried to be all things to all people,’ said fashion consultant Karen Kay. ‘But they should forget about 20, 30 or  40-something women. It is 50-plus women they need to target.’ One rival retailer declared the group had lost its way by trying to compete on price when it should be aiming to be a premium brand. ‘They compete with Waitrose on food so . why are they competing with the cheaper stores on clothing? They can’t . win in that market.’ Fashion flop: Children in the M&S Christmas TV advertisement . Backfired: Chief executive Marc Bolland's strategy of selling lower price fashion has not been a success with shoppers who generally view it as a premium brand . And Harold Tillman, former chairman of the British Fashion Council, warned: ‘Sainsbury, Tesco and Asda all do clothing and their reputations are currently stronger than M&S.’ Mr Bolland has moved John Dixon, previously head of M&S’s food business, to take charge of women’s fashion, and he took on Belinda Earl, former boss at Debenhams and Jaeger, to advise on style. At a London M&S yesterday, older shoppers backed the brand. Viv Harper, 58, from Kent, said: ‘Maybe younger people perceive it as old-fashioned, but not me.’ An M&S spokesman said:  ‘Our newly formed general merchandise management team is in place and already working hard on our new strategy for our clothing and home products.’","Chief executive Marc Bolland will be under great pressure from shareholders .

An agricultural research group is hoping to breed hypoallergenic apple by identifying varieties that do not cause an allergic reaction. Apples are not usually associated with allergies. However, 75 per cent of people suffering from an allergy to birch pollen are also allergic to apples. Those sensitive to the fruit can still experience unpleasant irritation and blistering of the tongue and lips. Tasty treat: Some apple varieties such as Golden Delicious and Granny Smith are part of the high-allergenic group, whereas Jonagold and Gloster induce only low allergenic responses . Experts including molecular biologists, plant physiologists and allergy specialists are genetically mapping out the apple in a bid to find hypoallergenic variants the can crossbreed. But the team is being cautious when it comes to the impact of updating the apple. ‘You cannot know what will happen when you silence an endogenous gene,’ plant physiologist, Alessandro Botton told Wired, explaining that the effects of a genetic switch would need to be monitored for unintended side effects. However, allergies are not static so what starts off as a hypoallergenic apple could still begin to cause irritation in consumers over time. ‘Some people who are allergic may simply say they don’t like apples, since they’ve a very mild reaction after eating them,’ Eric van de Weg, plant scientist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands told Fresh Plaza. ‘But others will suffer blistering, problems catching their breadth and swollen lips, tongue and throat.’The problem with projects like this is that a large section of the public are not willing to eat genetically engineered foods. The reduction of allergens in the food chain is extremely important though, says Lynn Frewer, an expert in risk communication in Newcastle University, UK. Researchers are creating a hypoallergenic apple by substituting natural proteins for those that don't cause an allergic reaction . ‘Although consumers – and in particular food-allergic consumers – were more positive about the [GM] apple, there was still a clear preference for traditional breeding methods applied to the same end if possible, even for food allergic consumers,’ she says. However, Mother Nature rather than GM may offer alternative solutions. ‘There are hundreds of apple varieties already available,’ says Allessandro Botton, a plant geneticist at the University of Padova, Italy, 'and some of these may hold answers'. For instance, it is known that apple varieties such as Golden Delicious and Granny Smith are part of the high-allergenic group, whereas Jonagold and Gloster induce only low allergenic responses.","People with an allergy to apples can suffer from blistering, problems catching their breadth, swollen lips, tongue and throat .

Pictures of Paolo Di Canio's elaborate fascist tattoo have emerged on the day he takes charge of Sunderland for the first time. The design features an imperial eagle holding the fasces, the original symbol of fascism in Italy under Benito Mussolini. Although the tattoo was completed it 2004, the pictures will raise eyebrows as it comes just days after he denounced fascism. Paolo Di Canio has a large tattoo of the notorious fascist symbols of the imperial eagle and fasces, which were adopted by the Italian Fascist movement and later the Nazi party. The tattoo also features a portrait of Benito Mussolini in a military helmet . Di Canio will take charge of his first match as Sunderland manager today when his side face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He was forced to distance himself from the ideology last week after the Dean of Durham released an emotional open-letter saying his appointment as the Black Cats boss 'raises very difficult questions'. But despite saying he is not a political person, Di Canio wrote in his autobiography how his tattoo was done by two ultra-right Lazio supporters. The tattoo design also features a portrait of Mussolini wearing a military helmet. The imperial eagle was adopted by the Nazi party and used in combination with the swastika on the orders of Adolf Hitler. The Italian Fascist Blackshirts wore uniform with the fasces or an eagle clutching a fasces on their caps or left arms. Di Canio has a separate tattoo of DVX on his arm, a tribute to the fascist leader who was known as Il Duce. In his book, The Return, Di Canio said the designs 'clearly show my political faith.' However, Di Canio released a statement last week in which he said he is not 'political'. Di Canio, pictured at Lazio, has been seen giving the straight-arm salute on at least three occasions in public . Di Canio, left, was forced to denounce fascism after an open letter from the Dean of Durham, right . The Italian wrote: 'I have clearly stated that I . do not wish to speak about matters other than football; however, I have . been deeply hurt by the attacks on the football club. 'This is a historic, proud and . ethical club and to read and to hear some of the vicious and personal . accusations is painful.

'I am not political, I do not . affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not . support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone. 'I am a football man and this and my family are my focus. Now I will speak only of football.' His stance surprised sports journalist Elisabetta Esposito, who co-wrote his autobiography.

He told The Sunday Times: 'It's better if we don't talk about that. He is suffering because of this.'

The extreme-right activist was held in prison on remand for eight years over a terrorist bombing which killed 85 people in 1980.

The mother of Jade Lomas-Anderson, who was mauled to death by a pack of dogs, has described saying goodbye to her daughter as she lay in the mortuary. Shirley Lomas-Anderson, 36, said she sat with Jade for hours before kissing her for the final time. She said her daughter's body had been covered with white sheets to spare her family seeing the horrifying injuries. Only her face and hands, which were covered in scratches, were visible. Shirley Lomas-Anderson said she sat with Jade for hours in the mortuary before kissing her goodbye . Mrs Lomas-Anderson told The Sun: 'I said, ""I love you, I'll miss you, I just want you back home""'. Jade, 14, was alone at a friend's house in Chaucer Grove, Atherton, near Wigan, on March 26 when she was attacked by four dogs - two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers. Neighbours said she was attacked when she walked into the room holding a meat pie. One of the dogs went for the food but as Jade tried to fight it off she was dragged to the floor and killed by the four dogs. Police marksmen shot the animals when they arrived at the house. Last week Greater Manchester Police said they could not prove a crime had been committed and so were unlikely to make a prosecution, although a spokesman said one may be brought in the future. The dogs involved in the attack, which happened on private property, were not illegal breeds. Jade's family have now launched an online petition calling for a change in the law. The Justice for Jade petition said the family want the law to 'make dog owners accountable for their dogs'. Mrs Lomas-Anderson said dog owner Beverley Concannon, left, was a 'heartless monster' for not apologising for Jade's, right, death . Buddy, a Bull Mastiff, was one of four dogs owned by Colcannon destroyed by armed police after the attack . A male Staffordshire Bull Terrier (right) and Bull Mastiff Neo (left). It is believed the dogs attacked Jade when she walked into the room carrying a meat pie . It calls for licences to be introduced and have dogs registered and micro-chipped to 'save other families suffering like we have gone through.' The petition will trigger a Commons debate if it reaches 100,000 signatures. Mrs Lomas-Anderson and her husband Mike, 33, who brought up Jade since she was a small child, said the teenager was allowed to go to friend Kimberley's house for a sleepover after receiving all As and Bs in her report. Jade, who had ADHD, was in constant contact with her mother throughout the night and went back home to collect some medicine the following day. She then went back to her friend's house in Atherton, Greater Manchester, when she attacked by Beverley Concannon's dogs. The couple were called by neighbours and they immediately drove to Concannon's house where police had already put up a cordon. Mrs Lomas-Anderson said she was convinced it would not be her daughter that was hurt. She told The Sun: 'I was screaming, ""I want to see my baby, I want to see my baby"" but I couldn't get through the police, I couldn't get to her'. Beverley Concannon's house, where Jade was attacked, has now been boarded up . A police forensic officer investigates the scene at Concannon's house where a warning sign was displayed . Jade's parents say they want the law change to prevent the same tragedy happening to another family . Jade's parents were then escorted home where they were told the devastating news. The couple have called said Concannon is a 'heartless monster' for not apologising for their daughter's death. Her house has now been boarded up while police continued . to carry out investigations. Concannon is thought to have been in hiding ever since the attack and her house has been sealed off by the council following requests by the police. Mr Lomas-Anderson said he hoped the petition will lead to a change in the law to protect other families. He told The Sun: 'I would never have let Jade stay if I knew those dogs were there and I feel so guilty about that - it's eating me up inside.' A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said last week: 'At this stage of the inquiry, we do not have anything evidentially to categorically prove a crime has been committed, therefore it is unlikely at this stage we will be seeking to bring a prosecution. 'That is not to say that no prosecution will ever be brought, and we still have a number of inquiries to make. 'While we do not want to be drawn on the politics surrounding the legislation of dangerous dogs, we are nonetheless bound by the law. 'As always, our thoughts are with Jade's family, and we continue to offer them support at such a difficult time in their lives.'","Jade Lomas-Anderson killed in attack by four dogs at friend's house .
