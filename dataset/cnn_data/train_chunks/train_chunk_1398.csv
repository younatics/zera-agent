"A Hong Kong woman who tortured her Indonesian maid in a case that sparked outrage around the world has been convicted of a string of assault charges. A judge found Law Wan-tung guilty of 18 charges including grievous bodily harm, criminal intimidation and failure to pay wages or give time off work to Erwiana Sulistyaningsih. Ms Sulistyaningsih's case highlighted the vulnerabilities of migrants working as domestic staff across Asia and the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Law Wan-tung has been found guilty of torturing her Indonesian maid, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih - who is pictured above at a hospital in Sragen, Indonesia, after her case first came to light . The court heard that Law punched Ms Sulistyaningsih in the mouth, fracturing some teeth. Ms Sulistyaningsih is pictured above recovering from her injuries . Ms Sulistyaningsih, centre, accompanied by her supporters, walks out of the court in Hong Kong . District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock said she was 'sure' Law, seen above leaving the court last month, did assault, wound and threaten Ms Sulistyaningsih as charged . It gained widespread attention about a year ago after photos of her injuries circulated among Indonesians in Hong Kong. They showed her face, hands and legs covered with scabs and lacerations, and blackened, peeling skin around her feet. District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock said that based on Ms Sulistyaningsih's testimony and that of other witnesses, 'I am sure the defendant did assault, wound and threaten (Sulistyaningsih) as charged'. The court heard that Law punched Ms Sulistyaningsih in the mouth, fracturing some teeth; jammed a metal vacuum cleaner tube in her mouth, cutting her lip; and hit her on the back with a feather duster when she was sleeping. Law also forced the maid to stand naked in the bathroom during winter while she splashed water on and pointed a fan at her. Ms Sulistyaningsih, who worked for Law for about eight months starting in June 2013, wasn't allowed any days off and was not paid her salary. Law was found not guilty of two other charges. She was ordered to pay about £2,400 in outstanding wages to Ms Sulistyaningsih. Law was remanded into custody and is scheduled to be sentenced on February 27. After the verdict supporters applauded Ms Sulistyaningsih who said she was happy 'because I will get the justice from Hong Kong'. There are about 330,000 foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong, almost all female and most from the Philippines or Indonesia, earning a minimum wage of about £328 a month.

"Ed Miliband has been thrown an election lifeline as a new opinion poll reveals that Labour could avoid a total wipeout in Scotland. The TNS survey, published today, reveals a ten-point gap between Labour and the Nationalists, while around a quarter of voters remain undecided ahead of May’s contest. If replicated in the General Election, the SNP would still seize a huge number of seats from its old rival, sending a record number of MPs to Westminster. But some of Labour’s biggest names would cling on with reduced majorities, including Douglas Alexander, Margaret Curran and Anas Sarwar. Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party is set to seize a huge number of seats from its old rival Labour in the upcoming General Election . The picture remains incredibly bleak for the Lib Dems, however, with only 4 per cent of Scots set to vote for the party. That could leave it with only two seats, terminating the political careers of Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, Women’s Minister Jo Swinson and former Scottish Secretary Michael Moore. The Tories would enjoy a mini-revival, adding an extra seat to their current tally of one. Britain’s leading elections expert Professor John Curtice said: ‘Today’s poll gives Scottish Labour some hope of minimising the damage that the SNP threatens to inflict on its representation at Westminster. ‘If the SNP lead is kept down to ten points, as this poll suggests could happen, the party might still hang on to half its seats at Westminster. Even so, such an outcome could still scupper Ed Miliband’s hopes of winning a Commons majority.’ TNS surveyed 1,006 adults aged 18 and over between January 14 and February 2. Unusually for a pollster, voters were interviewed face-to-face, rather than over the phone or online. Among those who stated a preference and said they were certain to vote, the SNP is on 41 per cent – double its share of the vote in 2010. Labour trails on 31 per cent, with the Tories on 16 per cent, the Greens on 6 per cent, the Lib Dems on 4 per cent and UKIP on 2 per cent. With a uniform swing across the country, that would hand the Nationalists 35 seats and reduce Labour’s total from 41 to 20. A new opinion poll reveals that Ed Miliband's Labour could yet avoid a total wipeout in Scotland in the upcoming General Election . Some of Labour’s biggest names may yet cling on with reduced majorities, including Douglas Alexander (right) and Margaret Curran (left), according to the survey . The findings differ from most other recent polls, which gave the SNP a much bigger lead. A YouGov survey published last week put the SNP on 48 per cent, with Labour on 27 per cent. Tom Costley, head of TNS Scotland said: ‘Twenty-six per cent of all adults aged 18-plus in Scotland, and 24 per cent of those who say they are certain to vote on the day, are currently undecided, suggesting there is still considerable scope for all parties to influence the final results.’ A spokesman for Scottish Labour said: ‘This poll shows yet again that only Scottish Labour is big enough to defeat the SNP in Scotland.’ SNP General Election campaign director Angus Robertson MP said: ‘This poll shows a strong lead for the SNP – but we are taking absolutely nothing for granted and will work hard for every vote and seat in May. ‘It will come as a major blow to Jim Murphy and the Labour leadership in Scotland that since taking over as Labour leader last year, people are no more likely to vote for Labour than they were under Johann Lamont. People can only make Scotland’s priorities Westminster’s priorities by voting SNP in May.’","Ed Miliband thrown an election lifeline as new poll reveals ten-point gap .

"Angry parents have criticised a school after senior teachers sent home children wearing their Air Cadets uniforms on Armistice Day because it breached its uniform rules. Pupils at Smestow Sports Academy, in Wolverhampton, had donned their blue uniforms in honour of Britain's fallen soldiers on Monday. Aman Nanglu, 15, Rezanne Willis, 16, and Elle Phillips, 15, made the decision to pay their own tribute while the nation fell silent during the two minute act of remembrance. Upsetting: Students (left to right) Aman Nanglu, 15, Rezanne Willis,16, and Elle Phillips,15, were all sent home from school for wearing their Air Cadet uniforms on Armistice Day . But they were stunned when teachers threw them out of class just after 11am - because the cadet uniforms broke school rules. They were told by headteacher Martyn Morgan they could only return once they had changed out of the military attire and into their school uniform. Today the families of the schoolchildren - who are all members of the 1047 City of Wolverhampton Air Training Corps squadron - branded the decision 'disrespectful.' Elle's father, Paul Phillips, 47, from Merry Hill, West Midlands, was contacted at 11.30am by the school to inform him his daughter would be leaving lessons at midday. The project engineer said: 'I don't think there is anything wrong with it. In fact, I am proud that Elle wanted to wear it. 'She is a very good student and she feels strongly about it. 'We thought it was just respectful to show it wouldn't just be a normal day. 'We wanted to show it does actually matter.' Indignant: The headteacher at Smestow School and Sports college in Wolverhampton maintained today that the cadet uniforms broke school rules . Aman's mother Meena Kumari, 45, added: 'I'm utterly shocked. 'These youngsters take a lot of pride and they are on the right track. 'Why can't the school see why they are doing it?' Another parent, who did not wish to be named, said: 'You would think the school could make an exception on such a day - its not like they were going along in fancy dress. 'The Air Cadets uniform is smart and always impeccable - they were not going to lessons dressed like scruffs. 'They were raising awareness for a great cause. 'It is a disgrace, you would think common sense would prevail on such an occasion as Armistice Day.' Students were told they could not return to the school until they had changed back into their jumpers and ties. Headteacher Martyn Morgan said it was school policy for children to wear their uniforms at all times. He added: 'They were not wearing school uniform. 'They were asked to return to school once they had changed into school uniform. 'As is our normal practice the parents of the students were contacted first and we made it explicit that they should return to school once changed. 'This process is in line with the guidelines in the Department for Education publication 'School Uniform A Guide for Headteachers, Governing Bodies, Academy Trusts, Free Schools and Local Authorities'.'","Aman Nanglu,15, Rezanne Willis,16, and Elle Phillips,15, sent home at midday .

"A football fan has blasted a Premier League club after shelling out £38 on an away-end seat that offered almost no view of the pitch. Southampton supporter Sam White was horrified when he got to his seat at Loftus Road on Saturday to watch the away clash with QPR to find his view was almost completely blocked. Instead of watching his beloved Saints clinch a last-gasp 1-0 win in the Premiership match, Mr White was forced to stare at a massive steel container - thought to be a commentary box - which obstructed most the pitch. Scroll down for video . Sam White's view of the pitch at Loftus Road was almost totally obscured by this commentary box . Sadio Mane celebrates after scoring in the 93rd minute as Southampton grabbed a late win at QPR . He was a unable to see the 90th-minute goal, the kick-off, or any of the action at one end. He is now demanding a full refund for his £38 'restricted view' seat - because he claims it was far too restricted. He said: 'I think it is crazy that they can legally sell these. 'Whether £38 is cheap for a Premier League ticket or not, I wouldn't have taken the ticket for free having known the view. 'I don't understand how the club hasn't been sanctioned before, it is absolute madness. I would have been a lot angrier had we not grabbed a 90th-minute winner.' He is now demanding a refund after the picture he tweeted from his seat went viral on Twitter. A spokesman for Queens Park Rangers FC said: 'Loftus Road is an all-seater stadium and while we understand the supporter’s frustration, we as a club advise fans to sit down for a number of reasons. 'Safety is of paramount importance and the main purpose for asking everyone to sit down, but it is also to ensure the best possible view of the pitch from all seats. 'Owing to the structure of Loftus Road, if everyone in the stadium stood up there would be a number of viewing positions where it would not be possible to see both goals. Loftus Road isn’t unique in this. 'Once again, we are sorry to hear of the supporter’s disappointment following his visit to Loftus Road and in light of his observations, we will be contacting all opposing clubs in advance of their fixture at our stadium to reiterate to them the importance of their supporters remaining seated to ensure the best possible viewing experience for their fellow fans.'","Fan charged £38 for a seat that offered almost no view of the football pitch .

"David Cameron already has a reputation for being the chillaxing Prime Minister. Now it has emerged he has shunned formal meetings about the details of policy, to instead summon advisers for a ‘chaterama’. Mr Cameron has taken to using the bizarre phrase with aides in Downing Street, in the latest signs of his relaxed approach to running the country. David Cameron has taken to using the bizarre phrase 'chaterama' with aides in Downing Street, in the latest signs of his relaxed approach to running the country. Friends – and enemies – have long noted Mr Cameron’s ability to rise above the political fray. An ally once told the PM’s biographers: ""If there was an Olympic gold medal for 'chillaxing', he would win it.’ He was hailed for being ‘capable of switching off in a way that almost no other politician I know of can’. Just last week Mr Cameron revealed how he finds time to watch House of Cards, Wolf Hall, Game of Thrones and Disney film Frozen. But it seems his relaxed approach even extends to meetings in which officials expect to focus on the minutiae of government reforms. The Prime Minister recently summoned a special adviser for a briefing in Number 10, according to The Times. The adviser turned up for the meeting with a ‘hefty pile of papers’ in preparation for difficult questions from Mr Cameron. But as the meeting began, Mr Cameron leant back in his chair and declared: ""Now, I just want a chaterama about this."" The briefing papers went undisturbed as the Prime Minister enjoyed the casual chat. Advisers summoned to 10 Downing Street expecting detailed policy discussions have been greeted by a more relaxed Prime Minister . With less than three months to go until the general election, there is little new legislation going through the Commons. Most MPs spend barely two full days a week in Westminster, with the rest of the time campaigning in their constituencies. In an interview with MailOnline last week, Mr Cameron revealed what he hopes his legacy as Prime Minister would be. 'The one thing that matters most to me is securing our economy,’ he said. 'I think this government has done lots of important things, but the most important this is getting the country back on track, growth jobs, living within our means. That's what it's about.' He also revealed he likes both House of Cards and Game of Thrones, adding: ‘Thrones more than Cards. I’m a big Thrones man.' He prefers Wolf Hall to Downton Abbey, and finds Gogglebox ‘extraordinarily insightful’. He admitted that even being Prime Minister does not give him the power to stop another rendition of songs from Disney film, Frozen. Asked if he is a Frozen fan, he replies wearily: 'I have no choice.' His youngest daughter Florence, aged four, 'of course is Elsa', he says. His security detail also have to put up with the songs on loop when travelling with the family.","Prime Minister used bizarre phrase during meeting with special adviser .

"This lion has shown the world exactly who's king of the pride after he delighted visitors to his safari park with several almighty roars which echoed across the grounds - before he got bored and retired for a nap. In scenes strikingly similar to animated children's film 'Madagascar', the African lion prowled out onto a rocky plateau and made a series of impressive deep growling noises before launching into a roar. Visitors to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park were clearly delighted and in footage filmed during the spectacle much oohing and aahing can be heard as they watch the alpha male make the spine-tingling sounds. The lion at San Diego Zoo Safari Park (pictured) showed off his vocal range during his recent performance . At one point it sounded almost as if the big cat was barking at the crowd with a rhythmic and guttural growl which reverberated around the enclosure. Clearly satisfied with a job well done, the lion then appears to tire of his efforts and turns his back on the crowd, presumably to go back to sleep. It is unclear if the lion was warning someone off or simply stretching his vocal chords. The video, which was uploaded yesterday on YouTube,  has already garnered more than 88,500 views. The incident resembles a scene from hit movie Madagascar in which Alex, a sheltered and spoiled zoo lion, roars for his doting fans as part of a nightly show. The male African lion appeared to lose interest with the crowd following his spine-tingling display . The incident resembles a scene from hit movie Madagascar in which Alex roars for his doting fans . It is not clear which of San Diego's three male African lions gave the impressive performance. The video sparked a number of comments on social media. Jack T wrote on YouTube: 'Hello everyone, cat expert and lion translator here. His accent sounds a bit thick but this is the gist of it, ""To all delicious humans seeing me this day. I, Leonid (unintelligible) want to let you all know it's perfectly safe to come over the fence. I have a nice place here and love visitors.""' But others were more concerned by the unusual sounds the lion made. Anonymous wrote: 'This is sad. The King of the jungle trapped in a small enclosure. He's probably crying for help.' On Reddit, sarcastifrey wrote: 'I have only experienced a lions roar once and it was so amazing and terrifying all at the same time. You could feel the sound vibrating in your chest.' The incident was similar to Alex the Lion's nightly show of roaring in children's film 'Madagascar' (pictured) EV0LUTIONX, who witnessed the event, said: 'I'm pretty sure the reason the little kids around quieted down was because of the reverberations. I had no idea an animal could make that kind of sound.' Hairless_Talking_Ape added: 'When you hear a lion roar in real life, you can feel it go through your body. I was at the zoo and my buddy thought it was some loudspeaker before we saw the lion actually roaring. He thought there was no way that an animal could make that sound. I don't blame him though, it really is monstrous in person.' The San Diego Zoo Safari Park has continuously had lions on show since it opened in 1972. In 2004 the Safari Park’s Lion Camp opened with the arrival of six six-month-old lion cubs from a facility in Africa. Lion Camp is currently home to three of those original six cubs: male Izu and his two female companions, Oshana and Mina. Many of their 18 surviving cubs from over the years are now residing in other zoos, but six are still at the park, including a litter of four born in July 2014. Lions vary in colour but typically sport light yellow-brown coats. Mature male lions are unique among big cats due the thick brown or black manes that encircle their necks and protect them while fighting. In the wild lions consume a wide variety of prey, from wildebeest, impala,zebra, giraffe, buffalo and wild hogs to sometimes even rhinos and hippos. They will also feed on smaller animals such as hares, birds and reptiles. Lions are also known to attack elephants when food is scarce. The lion population in Africa has been reduced by half since the early 1950s. Today, less than 21,000 remain in all of Africa. The only social member of the cat family, lions live in large groups called prides, consisting of about 15 lions. Related females and their young make up the majority of the pride. A single male, or sometimes a small group of two or three males, will join a pride for an indefinite period, usually about three years or until another group of males takes over. Males defend the pride's territory, which may include some 100 square miles of grasslands, scrub, or open woodlands. Female lions are the pride's primary hunters and often work together to catch their prey.

"The woman who gunned down her ex-husband, a respected colon cancer researcher, in a murder-suicide at the University of South Carolina, had been living together with him more than a year after their divorce, according to court documents. Sunghee Kwon shot Dr Raja Fayad, a Lebanese colon cancer specialist and graduate director at USC's Public Health Research Center, in his fourth floor office after he'd reportedly moved out of their home to be with a new girlfriend. The couple had up until recently been living under the same roof, even after their divorce, in spite of Kwon saying in divorce papers they'd lived apart since January 2013, according to divorce papers filed in August of that year. Murder-suicide: Dr Raja Fayad (left), a graduate director and expert in colon cancer, was gunned down at the University of South Carolina's Public Health Research Center by his ex-wife, Sunghee Kwon (right) WISTV reports Kwon also stated in court documents that she had moved to Chicago in April 2013, where she claimed to own several properties. According to Lexington County records, the couple bought a home in Columbia in August 2009 about 15 miles from the Arnold Public Health Research Center where Dr Fayad had worked since 2008. Kwan committed suicide by turning her pistol to her stomach and firing, according to Richland County Coroner Gary Watts. A 9mm handgun with an empty magazine was found near the bodies, State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry said. Kwon, 46, and Fayad, 45, split up for good a few months ago, Watts said. Kwon was still living in the couple's home near Lake Murray in Lexington County, while Fayad had moved to a long-term hotel with a family member, according to the coroner. Neighbors said Fayad, who completed his MD in Syria before moving to the United States, recently ended a 'stormy relationship' with a woman he was living with, described as his girlfriend. Fathi Elsahli told The State the situation had deteriorated when he moved out to be with another woman. Victim: Students raved about Dr Fayad, who had earned his medical degree at Aleppo University before taking teaching positions in the United States . Fayad and Kwon had moved from Chicago, where Fayad had been teaching at the University of Illinois-Chicago. She settled in August after getting a job, but then lost it, the paper reported. Helena Sanford, who lives next door, said the Faya's ex girlfriend told her that Internet service and electricity had been cut off at the home. She told the paper: 'It's devastating. It's a terrible waste of life.' Many students rated Fayad highly before his death, suggesting he made Exercise Science 223, a anatomy and physiology course, bearable. On the anonymous review site Rate My Professor Fayad earned a 4.7 on a 5.0 scale. Some of the comments included were: 'Dr. Fayad is the man. He is super laid back and loves the material he teaches. ... One of the best professors I’ve had. Lockdown: Heavily armed and armored police from Columbia, South Carolina swarmed the campus on Thursday afternoon after a gunman opened fire . Precautions: There was no longer any active danger almost immediately following what many reports have called a murder-suicide . Another read: 'Take this professor. He is awesome! He knows what he is teaching and seems interested in his research.' According to divorce records, Kwon was jobless and on unemployment benefits when the pair divorced, though she anticipated getting a job, and both parties agreed neither would pay alimony. Kwon claimed three real estate lots among non-marital property, which she said she bought using her own savings. She asked the court to leave these properties, including a Chicago property bought with a pension and another marital property the couple owned, in her name. Much of the campus remained on a complete lockdown in the aftermath of the shooting even though police said danger from the 'very isolated' incident was over. According to The State reporter Amanda Coyne, some professors even taught through the lockdown. The shooting happened a couple of blocks from the Statehouse and two blocks from the university's basketball arena. The street is one of the city's busiest. Sirens could be heard as more police officers arrived at the public health building. Shots fired: The University of South Carolina campus in Columbia was put on lock down and students told to shelter in place following a 1:20pm shooting Thursday . Law enforcement officials gather on the campus of the University of South Carolina in Columbia after shots were fired at its new School of Public Health on Thursday . The shooting occurred in or near the relatively new Arnold School of Public Health as police in SWAT gear with AR-15 secured its perimeter and ushered away students . An alert was also issued to employees at the South Carolina Statehouse in Columbia, where personnel performed security sweeps as a precautionary measure. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley also cut short a news conference over security concerns. Student Hayden Dunn, a senior from Myrtle Beach, said he was in the building about 1 p.m., getting in an elevator to change classes, when a police officer also got inside. Dunn said the officer asked whether anyone had heard gunshots, but they hadn't. Dunn said he went to class, then an alarm sounded five minutes later, and people rushed outside. Another office told him shots had been fired, he said. 'Otherwise, you wouldn't have known anything happened,' Dunn said.","Raja Fayad, 45, was gunned down at the Columbia campus on Thursday .

"The family of a gipsy great-grandfather fear his body could be exhumed because the relatives of a Muslim man buried in the neighbouring plot have complained that he is an unbeliever. Shadrack Smith, 89, from Leicester, who was a popular figure in the Romany gipsy community, died on January 13 after breaking his hip on New Year's Eve and developing pneumonia. His bereft family paid £2,500 for three plots at the multi-faith cemetery in Lychgate Lane Cemetery, Burbage, Leicestershire. The grave of Shadrack Smith, 89, from Leicester, who was a popular figure in the Romany gipsy community, died on January 13 after breaking his hip on New Year's Eve and developing pneumonia . But the Muslim family who own a plot next to Mr Smith's grave (pictured) complained to the council . After a huge traditional Romany funeral with more than 400 people, they buried him with his grave facing towards his home – also a Romany tradition. But they were left shocked when a Muslim family who owned a plot next to Mr Smith's grave complained to the council about their relative being buried next to a 'non-believer'. Just two weeks after his funeral, which was one of the largest ever held at the cemetery, the family say they fear Mr Smith's grave may have to be moved. The local council, which runs the award-winning cemetery, will meet tomorrow to discuss the 'provision for burials' at the cemetery but strongly denies that exhumation has been discussed as an option or that any reference was made to this when contacting the family. Shadrack Smith, 89, a popular figure in the Romany gipsy community in Leicester, died in January . But it said it was 'sympathetic to the feelings of both families concerned' and is 'committed to reaching an amicable and acceptable solution.' His distraught family, which includes eight children, 25 grandchildren and 40 great grandchildren, have now vowed to fight 'tooth and nail' to ensure Mr Smith's body is not moved. His daughter-in-law Tracey Smith 46, said: 'This whole thing has devastated our family. 'We were told when we bought the plots that it was a multi-faith cemetery and it is, but the council has been so unsupportive. 'I feel for the Muslim family because they obviously thought they were going to only have other Muslim families buried around them, but that's not our fault, or our mistake. 'We have been in the right, and yet the council has tried to bend over backwards to please the Muslim family.' She added: 'We have been told we might have to exhume Shady if the council decide to side with the Muslim family. 'My mother-in-law found a plot which faced their home, which is a Romany tradition, and it was perfect. 'So we paid, but to then have the council trying to get us to move when we have done nothing wrong, it's disgusting. We have not been able to grieve because of all this drama, and it's been awful.' Tracy Smith, 46 and her husband Sean, 47, said they will fight 'tooth and nail' over the issue. They say the complaint was lodged with the council days before Mr Smith was buried . After a huge traditional Romany funeral with more than 400 people,  dozens of floral tributes were left at Mr Smith's grave (pictured) Tthe family buried Mr Smith with his grave (pictured) facing towards his home – also a Romany tradition . Days before the funeral, Burbage Parish Council received a complaint from the Muslim family who own the neighbouring plot. The principal officer of the council contacted Mr Smith's family prior to the burial and asked if they would consider  an alternative plot. The council allegedly also asked if it could use one of the family's empty plots inbetween the two graves to plant a hedge as a separation. But Mrs Smith, from Aston Firs, Leicester, added: 'She said we should find another site but she did not even apologise to us. 'Then our undertaker phoned saying the she had been on the phone to them to see if they could use one of our plots to plant a hedge as a kind of barrier. But the bodies will still be together six feet underground so what is the point? The council said it was 'sympathetic to the feelings of both families concerned and is committed to working with the relatives and the wider community to reach an amicable and acceptable solution' Principal Officer Julie Perrin said there would be a meeting tomorrow to discuss the 'provision for burials' at the cemetery after a 'huge level' of complaint . Mr Smith, who died from pneumonia, was a popular figure in the Romany gipsy community in Leicester . 'I just feel they should have stuck to the rules (being a multi-faith cemetery) from the beginning, instead of deeply upsetting us just to please the Muslim community. 'There is no way Shady will be exhumed, if they suggest it we will take them to the highest court in the land. We will fight tooth and nail to stop the grave being dug up.' Burbage Parish Council yesterday said the family of the Muslim man may have mistakenly believed his grave was in an Islam-only section of the cemetery. Principal Officer Julie Perrin said there would be a meeting tomorrow to discuss the 'provision for burials' at the cemetery. She said: 'There was a huge level of complaint so the correct procedure has been followed. 'There appears to be an assumption or misunderstanding on the part of the family complaining because there is nothing in our policy documents about there being any segregation. 'There will be a meeting regarding the policy (of segregating graves depending on faith) where I hope the majority of the 20 councillors will attend but the families will not be represented there.' When asked about a possible exhumation, she added: 'Any application for moving a body would have to go through the Home Office if a family wanted that doing.' On the Burbage Parish Council website, a document about the cemetery makes no mention of segregation or separate areas based on religion. Pictured: Burbage Millennium Hall where the council is based . On the Burbage Parish Council website, a document titled 'Burbage Cemetery: Regulations and Management Rules' makes no mention of segregation or separate areas based on religion. Another council leaflet regarding the cemetery states: 'So that people of all denominations can use Burbage Cemetery, the graveyard ground at Lychgate Lane is unconsecrated.' Chairman of the parish council, Councillor Richard Flemming, said: 'Burbage Parish Council provides an award-winning cemetery for the benefit of the whole community. 'Unfortunately the parish council has recently received representation from two families regarding the allocation of adjacent grave plots within Burbage Cemetery. 'The parish council is sympathetic to the feelings of both families concerned and is committed to working with the relatives and the wider community to reach an amicable and acceptable solution.' Mr Smith, who always wore a trilby hat, had lived in an official gipsy camp in Aston Firs, Leicester, for 20 years. More than 400 family and friends paid their respects to the retired horse trainer at his funeral on January 30. In a statement, the council said that any suggestion it had considered the exhumation of 'person recently interred at Burbage Cemetery is totally untrue and without foundation'. It said that the council had been contacted by a Burbage resident several years ago, asking for provision to be made at the cemetery for a Muslim burial. It said: 'The Council were able to accommodate this request by facilitating swift arrangements for burial, providing a particular orientation to the grave and providing a larger size grave plot. The first Muslim burial at Burbage Cemetery took place several months ago. 'More recently a non-Muslim family with special requirements, which could be met by the provisions already put in place, were allocated the next grave plots within the same area of the Cemetery. 'Unfortunately a number of complaints followed and the Council initiated their correct procedures and considered the matter carefully. 'Burbage Parish Council has sought to resolve this matter in a fair and transparent manner and has had extensive dialogue with both families concerned.

"Martha Stewart has at last offered an insight into the rigorous beauty and health regime that helps her to maintain such a youthful appearance. Interestingly, the 73-year-old admitted that her seemingly ageless complexion does take a fair amount of work each and every day - starting off with a 4am wake-up call. 'I spend anywhere from seven to 30 minutes getting my face and hair ready each morning,' she told People.com. 'This doesn't include the time I spend doing advance prep like my daily face mask, which I apply at 4 am, and I use hand cream with gloves.' Scroll down for video . Age is just a number: Martha Stewart, 73, follows a strict skincare regime in order to maintain her complexion . Lifestyle expert: The TV host explained that there are many other aspects of her day-to-day routine which impact on how she feels and looks, particularly when it comes to sleep and exercise . Martha added that she follows up her early morning Yon-Ka Gommage mask with a strict skincare routine, starting with the Mario Badescu A.H.A. Botanical Body Soap and ending up with the $525 Cle De Peau La Crème. The TV host's choice of pricey products caused a stir among her fans, many of whom were less than enthusiastic about the prospect of having to spend so much money on a face cream in order to replicate Martha's youthful appearance. 'Only $525 for a jar of her daily moisturizer? I think I'll age like a regular person, thanks,' one reader commented, while another added: 'Ladies, save your [money], I'm married to a dermatologist. 'It's 50 per cent genetic and 50 per cent staying out of the sun, avoiding alcohol, exercising, and eating well.' Luckily however, not all of Martha's favorite beauty products come with quite the same hefty price tag. 'I always have Johnson's Baby Oil in my medicine cabinet,' she added. 'At night, I wash my face really well, because I have to have my makeup done a lot. Johnson's Baby Oil with a warm washcloth is one great way to take it off. Top of the range: Martha named this $525 Cle De Peau face cream as one of her best-loved beauty products . Budget-friendly: Not all of Martha's skincare choices come with a high-end price tag. She insists that Johnson's Baby Oil is the best product to use when it comes to removing make-up . 'I like oil because it keeps my skin very moist, and it works for me. I don't get clogged pores.' Despite being praised for her flawless complexion however, when it comes to choosing her own best physical features, Martha insists her hair draws in just as many compliments as her skin and credits an ever-changing roster of shampoos with helping to maintain her lustrous locks. Martha also added that following a strict workout routine, avoiding alcohol and ensuring she gets plenty of sleep have all contributed to her glowing complexion and healthy physique. She insists that, whenever she has a big photoshoot or event to prepare for, she spends the days leading up to it preparing, in order to make sure that she looks her very best. But even Martha admits that nobody is perfect; she confessed that there are a number of things people would likely change about her if given the chance, but added that she doesn't let any of them weigh on her mind for too long. 'I have learned a lot over the years, but think everyone needs improvement,' she said. 'I could weigh 10 pounds less or comb my hair more often, for example.'","The lifestyle expert also admitted that she works out regularly, gets plenty of sleep, and avoids drinking alcohol before a big photoshoot or event .

"Farmers and homeowners across country are spraying herbicides on milkweed plants - and in doing so, they're causing a massacre of the monarch butterfly. When spraying the plant, they're destroying the iconic orange-and-black butterflies' nursery, food source and habitat, leaving millions homeless. Since 1990, about 970million of the colorful creature have vanished - a 90 per cent decline in the species. And in an attempt to counter years of destruction, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Wildlife Federation and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation have launched a partnership in hopes of growing milkweed and saving the monarchs. Scroll down for video . Since 1990, about 970million monarch butterflies have vanished - a 90 per cent decline in the species. Species are dying out as their habitats are ruined by herbicides and climate change . In an attempt to counter years of destruction, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Wildlife Federation and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation have launched a partnership in hopes of growing milkweed . About $2million of the $3.2million project will be used to restore more than 200,000 acres of milkweed (pictured) habitat from California to the Corn Belt . About $2million of the $3.2million project will be used to restore more than 200,000 acres of habitat from California to the Corn Belt. The restoration includes more than 750 schoolyard habitats and pollinator gardens, which could increase, or at least keep stagnant, the number of monarchs in the United States. Each winter, monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles from the United States and Canada to central Mexican forests. And in the spring, the insect makes the trek back. Because butterflies only live for four to five weeks, the trip requires six generations to complete. Their food supply of milkweed - which is also their home across the United States - is decreasing. Farmers and homeowners are spraying herbicides, or weed killers, reducing the availability of the plant. The monarchs spend their winters in Mexican mountain forests where climate is less extreme and they have a better chance of survival. But nearby human communities rely on the same forests for agriculture and tourist activities. Climate change disrupts the butterfly's annual migration pattern by affecting conditions in both winter grounds and summer breading grounds. While colder and wetter winters could be lethal to the insects, hotter and drier summers could shift habitats more north. Source: World Wildlife Fund . There are about 30million monarch butterflies remaining in the United States, according to the Washington Post. Remaining money will be used to start a conservation fund that will provide grants to farmers and other landowners to conserve habitat. The move by the Fish and Wildlife Service comes as it considers whether to classify the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which would give the butterfly more protection. 'We can save the monarch butterfly in North America but only if we act quickly and together,' said Service Director Dan Ashe. Monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles to Canada from Mexico each spring on a journey that requires six generations of the insect to complete. On the journey, the insect - which only lives for four to five weeks - lays its eggs exclusively on the milkweed plant. Conversion of prairies into cropland and the increasing use of pesticide-resistant crops have greatly reduced milkweed, which is also an important food source, particularly in the heartland, according to a petition filed last August by environmental groups. The conservation projects will be focused on the Interstate 35 corridor from Texas to Minnesota, in areas that provide important spring and summer habitats along the path for about 50 per cent of the migrating monarchs. Fish and Wildlife Service is encouraging other federal and state agencies to join in on the project and preserve public land as well. The move by the Fish and Wildlife Service comes as it considers whether to classify the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which would give the butterfly more protection . Monarch butterflies (pictured here as a caterpillar) travel thousands of miles to Canada from Mexico each spring on a journey that requires six generations of the insect to complete . The group is working with governments in Canada and Mexico to help the iconic butterfly. Yosemite National Park, too, offers protection for the milkweed plant. Cities across the United States have declared themselves sanctuaries for monarchs. The groups heading the preservation project said the new announcement was a positive step, but the species needs legal protection. Monarchs are pollinators and indicators of broader environmental problems. 'The specter of listing will spur a lot of conservation for the monarch,' said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that asked the Fish and Wildlife Service last August to protect the monarch butterfly and set aside critical habitat. But Curry said the butterfly needed to be listed for it to recover. Other species of butterflies have faced extinction in the past, according to Fish and Wildlife Service. The Xerces blue vanished from San Francisco sometime in the mid-1900s, and two subspecies - the rockland grass skipper and Zestos in Florida - haven't been seen since 2004.

"A water manager was caught urinating into a reservoir that provides water for 2.5million people in San Francisco. Martin Sanchez, a maintenance planner at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, is likely to be suspended from his $115,000-a-year post after he was caught relieving himself in the Priest Reservoir in the Sierra foothills. The utilities commission received an anonymous complaint that Sanchez was seen urinating in the reservoir 'several times' by a number of workers. Martin Sanchez, who works for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, was seen urinating in a reservoir that supplies water to millions of people who live nearby. He is likely to be suspended . He is now likely to be suspended for five days without pay, CBS reported. Tyrone Jue, spokesman for the utilities commission, said the reservoir - which supplies water to people in the Bay Area - was being drained at the time and people faced no risk. He added that water would have been specifically cleaned anyway, had it been in use. But, he added: 'The bottom line is — you pee in the wrong place again, and you are toast.' The actions of Sanchez on January 6 have been branded 'unacceptable.' The reservoir holds 674-million gallons of water which supplies around 2.5million people in the nearby area . Water collected from the 674-million gallon reservoir, located around 150 miles from San Francisco, is usually treated with ultraviolet light and chlorine before it is sent by pipeline to supply customers' homes.

"'Heeere's Johnny!' Nope. It's actually David and Rebecca Wilson. The Wilsons have been living together at the Many Glacier Hotel in Montana since October and taking care of the property during its off-season. Although they don't have a son named Danny, the Wilsons are aware some are comparing their situation to that of Jack and Wendy Torrance in Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. David and Rebecca Wilson have been living happily at the Many Glacier Hotel in Montana since October . David is a caretaker at the hotel and they will be there maintaining it all winter until the spring thaw in April . Given how isolated the hotel is (pictured left) and how cut off the Wilsons are from the rest of the world, many have compared their situation to the one in the film The Shining (pictured right) Many Glacier, which is located on the eastern edge of Glacier National Park, welcomes hundreds of thousands of guests each summer before it closes down for the year in September. Now the vacation hotspot has only two visitors: Rebecca and David. An employee of the hotel since 2008, David does maintenance work on the 76-acre, 100-year-old property. This is the first winter he or Rebecca have stayed at the hotel to watch over it until things thaw out in the spring. They will be battling snow, rain, wind, and occasional four-legged houseguests until April. The Wilsons have seen fewer than ten people during their stay at Many Glacier and so isolated the only emergency vehicle that would be able to reach them is a snowplow, Yahoo Travel reported. In order to keep their friends, loved ones and past guests in the loop about what has been happening at the Swiss-alpine style hotel, David and Rebecca post updates on their A Winter At Many Glacier blog. They use the blog to post pictures, weather updates and information about the 'day to day life of the caretaker at the very remote Many Glacier Hotel in Glacier National Park'. Fewer than ten people have seen the Wilsons, but they provide updates via the Winter At Many Glacier blog . This is the first winter David (pictured right) has stayed at the hotel to maintain it during the cold and snow . The lobby of the hotel (left) looks reminiscent of a main room in the fictional Overlook Hotel (right) So far the 'all work and no play' lifestyle at the hotel hasn't caused either one of them to have a homicidal episode similar to Jack Nicholson's in The Shining. Fortunately for the Wilsons and the hotel's insurer, things sound peacefully dull at Many Glacier. The Wilsons have not had a 'Heeere's Johnny' moment at the hotel and hopefully they won't . David said: 'We watched The Shining up here just because of that and there are a lot of parallels. 'Our hotel isn't heated and we don't live inside of it. But as far as the long hallways, that's similar. 'There's also stocking up for food in the winter, which we have to do ourselves. 'And then of course the snow.' Even though there isn't a gigantic hedge maze on the property, there is a direct connection between Many Glacier and the fictional Overlook Hotel featured in the film. Kubrick filmed a scene for the movie, which is set in Colorado, on Glacier Park's Going-to-the-Sun Road, the Flathead Beacon reported. However, the Many Glacier only has 214 rooms, so the creepy Room 237 that Danny is warned to stay out of because it has a 'shine' in the film does not exist. Despite the isolation, the Wilsons don't sound as if they are looking forward to the spring. David said: 'Actually, the winter is going by too fast. 'We wish we had another six months of this. 'We love the valley anyway and I could live here year round. 'But the winter is a nice opportunity to catch up on maintenance so in the spring it's not such a push. 'It's like a tradition being passed along. 'When you're up here, you kind of take ownership of the place.' The property of Many Glacier does not contain a hedge maze, but it does border lakes and mountains . Many Glacier does have a bar (left) but it doesn't come stocked with a ghostly bartender... or Jack (right) Many Glacier welcomes hundreds of thousands of guests each summer before it closes down for the year . The Shining (pictured) was written by Stephen King and filmmaker Stanley Kubrick directed the movie . In their latest post, the Wilsons wrote: 'For the last four days it has been raining and we've seen a lot of our snow melt away. 'This is the second warm spell we've had this winter. 'It's amazing how much snow has disappeared, don't get me wrong we still have a lot of huge drifts around, but there have been more bare spots showing up lately. 'From what we've been told this kind of weather is normal even in the middle of winter and that the big snow months are still ahead.'","David and Rebecca Wilson are living at the Many Glacier Hotel in Montana .

Shouts of 'he shot her!' could be heard from the car as it slowly edged towards the footpath on Tuesday just before midday in West Hoxton, Sydney's west,  where five police officers were filmed surrounding the 22-year-old woman's body on the ground. The officers appeared to be frozen in place for an instant, with their guns still drawn, when the car finally came right up to the scene, the footage aired by Nine News revealed. As one policeman kneeled on the ground and rolled the woman's body onto its side, a male officer could be seen bending over with his hands on his knees before pacing slightly forward. Bending again even further and lowering his head, a female officer in front of him could be seen turning to face him as the unseen filmers hid their camera from view. Just before they finally drove off, the driver and his passengers captured a final glimpse of the scene. A second officer was filmed bending over the body as three more rushed to the scene, two of which had already begun putting on blue forensic gloves. Police attempted to revive the woman immediately after she was shot and an ambulance was called, however she died at the scene. The intersection  was temporarily closed to the public.

"The amount a person earns during their first ten years in the work force has a significant influence on their earning potential over their entire lifetime, new research has found. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York studied the period 1978 to 2010 and has concluded that a good start is vital to ensuring a better salary further down the line. 'Across the board, the bulk of earnings growth happens during the first decade,' states the paper written by economists Fatih Guvenen, Fatih Karahan, Serdar Ozkan and Jae Song. The Fed research isn't good news for the millions of millennials who entered the workforce after the economic downturn in 2007 and who's earning potential has got off to a slow start as a result . The research isn't good news for the millions of millennials who entered the workforce after the economic downturn of 2007 and who's earning potential has got off to a slow start as a result. From 2007 until the pace of hiring picked up last year, the jobless rates for millennials topped other age groups, even among those with freshly earned college and advanced degrees. Many were forced to enter the workforce in lower-wage jobs and will have a hard time catching up later in their careers. A steep learning curve early in ones career means that workers should be looking to increase their salary also, said Guvenen, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota. 'At 25, I choose a job that allows me to learn valuable skills,' Guvenen told the Washington Post. 'I'm investing in my future, and my employer is allowing me to invest in my future. Soon, I'm producing more for my employer - and my employer is paying me more.' The amount a person earns during their first ten years in the work force has a significant influence on their earning potential over their entire lifetime, new research from the Fed has found . Unfortunately for the average person earnings growth starts to stagnate after the first 10 years of work. The researchers found that the average earnings growth for the 35-to-55 age group was zero, with only the wealthiest workers sustaining increases throughout their careers. The Fed found that workers projected to earn the median lifetime amount would experience a 38 percent increase in their salary from age 25 to 55. Workers in the 95th percentile can expect a 230 percent increase over the same period, while the top one per cent - typically doctors, lawyers and engineers - could see earnings grown by a whopping 1,500 percent. At the other end of the scale is the bottom fifth of American earners, blue collar workers whose jobs are typically more physically demanding. They can expect to suffer an income decline from age 25 to 55. 'Low-skilled jobs tend to use brawn, not brain,' Guvenen said. 'Brawn depreciates very quickly. Your back starts to hurt. You become less and less productive. You cannot work as much.' The Fed found that workers projected to earn the median lifetime amount would experience a 38 percent increase in their salary from age 25 to 55 .","The Federal Reserve Bank study concluded that a good start is vital to ensuring a better salary later in life .

"A mother-of-three earns $65,000 a month from selling handmade headbands, socks and scarves on Etsy. In just three years Alicia Shaffer has become one of the most successful sellers on the online marketplace with her store Three Bird Nest and now sells 3,000 items per day. But it was all sprung from the need for a couple of headbands. Scroll down for video . In just three years mother-of-three Alicia Shaffer (pictured with her husband and children) has become one of the most successful sellers on Etsy. Her store Three Bird Nest is the second best-selling handmade product shop on the site . In 2011 Shaffer, who lives in Livermore, California, decided to make some hair pieces for her women's clothing boutique. Her creations were so popular the mother-of-three decided to start selling them on the online craft site. 'I opened an Etsy shop, figuring I'd help pay for dance lessons or offset the boutique's sales,' Shaffer told The Organic Bloom. Shaffer initially thought the high number of orders was due to the upcoming holiday season. But as Christmas passed and people kept buying, she widened her products to include scarves and leg warmers. Just 18 months later Shaffer sold her boutique so she could focus solely on Three Bird Nest, now the second best-selling handmade product shop on the site, according to the Huffington Post. But people may be surprised to find out that Shaffer has no background in fashion. Although she has worked with leather for years, the crafter has figured out everything else through 'trial and error.' Shaffer first began the shop in 2011 to sell a couple of headbands that were doing well in her boutique. The shop now sells 3,000 items a day, earns $65,000 a month and has over 86,000 sales in total . On Three Bird Nest's separate online shop, Shaffer writes that she simply loves figuring out how to make different fabrics work well with each other. On her site Shaffer writes that she creates for the woman whose 'a mom, a student, a daughter, a bride, a woman going on a first date' 'I love textiles, fabric, fashion, designs, and seeing how different colors and fabrics pair together,' she said. 'You will find me with my little sketch book and notebook anywhere I go so that I don't miss a moment to write down my next idea.' The Etsy shop currently offers a wide variety of products, including more than 58 different headband designs that range from $16 to $37, as well as boot socks, scarves, hats, gloves, leg warmers, purses and accessories. And the official website store has a larger selection of women's clothing, baby apparel and home decor. But one thing fans won't find in the store is the color red - Shaffer's not a fan. On her site the businesswoman writes that she creates for a woman who is 'sophisticated, yet fun' and 'loves fashion, but not being trendy'. 'She's a mom, a student, a daughter, a bride, a woman going on a first date.' Shaffer believes that to be successful one must 'eat, sleep and breathe' their brand, and says she keeps going because of the love and passion her customers have for her items. 'No matter how busy we get each time my Etsy app cha-chings I smile,' she said. 'I have had businesses that failed in the past, which is why this success is so much sweeter to me.' 'I will not give up on seeing this brand grow.' And she's getting some help at home. Shaffer's husband retired early from his job as a fire chief to help run the house, she told Yahoo! But it's her three children that ultimately are the fuel behind the mother's brand - they inspired it's very name. On her arm is a tattoo of three birds in a nest, one to represent each of her kids.

"Budget cuts: Leicestershire Police is to stop its neighbourhood police officers from investigating crimes in a move it hopes with save money . A police force is saving money by telling more than 150 of its beat bobbies to stop investigating crimes. Officers in Leicestershire will no longer be expected to pursue inquiries, go out on raids or attend incidents. Instead they will spend their time chatting to members of the public while on patrol and tackling low-level antisocial behaviour. Their chief constable insisted the radical changes are in response to public demand and pressures on limited resources. But the move provoked a furious backlash last night amid fears it will simply lead to more criminals 'getting away with it'. Labour MP Ian Austin, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'When a crime is committed, people want a police officer to investigate and the guilty people found, charged, taken to court and punished. 'Giving advice on not becoming a victim of crime is obviously important, but surely the police's number one job is to catch criminals so they can be convicted. We have got to be wary of anything which gives the public the impression that fewer crimes will be investigated.' Under the changes which come into force today, 155 beat bobbies will be rebranded 'Dedicated Neighbourhood Officers'. They will tackle low-level antisocial behaviour such as vandalism and nuisance _neighbours and give crime-prevention advice. But they will not be expected to probe crimes, which will instead be passed on to a new 'force investigation unit'. According to Leicestershire Chief Constable Simon Cole, this will make the officers 'more visible on the streets'. He said: 'This way of working will allow the teams in our communities to dedicate their time to working closely with neighbourhoods and partners to resolve issues at a local level.' Leicestershire Police added: 'Beat officers will be known as Dedicated Neighbourhood Officers to reflect a change in role that is solely focused on working with communities. 'They will no longer routinely carry out duties such as crime investigation, planned arrests and attending incidents – these will be dealt with by other specialist units.' The move is intended to plug a gap as Leicestershire Police axes 300 of its 2,200 officer posts over the next two years in a bid to save some £10million. Its progress will be watched closely by senior officers in every other force in the country who are desperate to find ways of cutting costs. But there are also concerns that the scheme could see crimes fall through the cracks if they do not come with promising leads or are not deemed serious enough for other officers to pursue. One source said: 'Officers will hate this because no one wants to be told to leave something to others who are 'better at investigating'. It's difficult to see why officers at the scene or with victims of crime cannot use the huge amount of training they receive to kick-start an investigation.' It is not the first time Leicestershire Police, which has a budget of £172million, has encountered controversy. Keeping us safe... on a budget: Leicestershire Police has ordered the move in response to budget cuts of £10million, which will also it see it axing nearly one in six its officers over the next two years . It was castigated for failing Fiona Pilkington, who killed herself and her disabled daughter in 2007 after suffering months of harassment at her home near Hinckley. After their deaths an independent inquiry found she had complained to police 33 times. Two years ago, residents expressed disbelief after officers spent hours hanging knitted pom-poms from trees. Householders had said they wanted more street lighting and CCTV, but in a move dubbed the 'worst crime-fighting idea ever', in a bid to 'reduce the fear of crime' police responded with the fluffy balls. But all police forces, including the Met, have had to shake up their local units to stretch resources and meet demand. Labour's police spokesman Jack Dromey said senior officers were 'masking' cuts by keeping police on the beat while slashing the number solving crimes. He said: 'The public will be rightly concerned that these cuts mean more criminals getting away with it.' A Leicestershire Police spokesman said: 'These changes have saved £10million. The force has remodelled how policing is delivered to provide the best possible service with the budget available.' The number of traffic police has fallen by almost a quarter in the past five years as speed cameras proliferate. There are 1,279 fewer officers patrolling highways – a 23 per cent drop, the RAC says. Some forces have cut their traffic police by more than three-quarters. The fall also coincides with a rise in road deaths and serious injuries – reversing years of falling casualty rates. The latest digital cameras can spot speeders across all the lanes of a motorway. But while the cameras are catching motorists at just a few miles over the limit, a lack of police using their eyes and experience means many potentially life-threatening offences that speed cameras cannot spot are going undetected and unpunished. These include those who text at the wheel, tail-gaters and aggressive drivers. The slashing of traffic police in England and Wales – the equivalent of five fewer officers a week – was revealed in response to a parliamentary question and analysed by the RAC. Devon and Cornwall police cut its traffic police by 76 per cent – from 239 to 57.","Leicestershire Police to take neighbourhood officers off investigations .

"Kirsty, 18, was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) at age 17 . Every night after her family meal, Kirsty Milne went to her bedroom where she stayed alone for the rest of the evening. But the teenager wasn't being moody - she was embarrassed. From the age of 13 she'd suffered from gastric reflux and within a few years it occurred whenever she ate or drank, coming up for as long as two hours afterwards. 'It was really unpleasant,' recalls Kirsty, 18, a student at Exeter University. At 17 her condition was properly diagnosed - she suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD), characterised by heartburn, burping and nausea (although she didn't have these symptoms), and regurgitating food. Also called acid reflux, it is largely considered an adult's disease, with one in five adults suffering from it at least once a week. But about 5 per cent of children and teenagers experience these same symptoms on at least a monthly basis. GORD causes stomach acid to spill up the oesophagus (gullet). Usually it's due to weakness of the lower oesophageal sphincter, the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus that lets food into the stomach and closes afterwards to ensure acid doesn't leak back up. Long term, GORD can damage the cells in the gullet's lining, increasing the risk of Barrett's oesophagus. This condition affects one in ten people with GORD and one in 200 people with Barrett's goes on to develop oesophageal cancer. Two weeks ago the Be Clear On Cancer campaign was launched, urging people with heartburn most days for three weeks to visit their doctor because this can be a sign of oesophagael or stomach cancer. The rise in childhood obesity means more young people are suffering with acid reflux, says Anton Emmanuel, a consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London. 'If the stomach is overfilled it makes more acid, so more can leak upwards,' he says. Scroll down for video . If someone has these problems as a child, it's likely to continue to be a problem in adulthood, explains Mike Thomson, a consultant paediatric gastroenterologist at Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust. He says: 'Often adults with acid reflux realise they had it during childhood without knowing what it was. And even GPs don't always recognise that children and young people can suffer acid reflux, delaying their treatment. Often the symptoms can be vague. But acid reflux should be considered by GPs if children experience pain when eating or when they wake up.' (Acid is more likely to splash back up the gullet in a horizontal position.) In July 2014 she underwent a keyhole procedure to place a 'bracelet' of magnetic beads around the lower part of her oesophagus. The device, called the Linx band, is available privately and on the NHS . GORD is different from the kind of reflux affecting newborns. Here the lower oesophagael sphincter relaxes at the wrong time, allowing acid to rise up the gullet; this tends to resolve itself when children start to walk - 'being in a upright position helps the food go down more easily,' says Dr Emmanuel. In January, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines for doctors, stressing the need to differentiate between infant reflux and GORD; they should also review a child's symptoms if regurgitation becomes more serious and refer them to a specialist. As Professor Mark Baker, the director for the centre for clinical practice at NICE, pointed out: 'If not treated, GORD can lead to malnutrition in children, cause ulcers in the oesophagus and can have psychological effects on a child's relationship with food.' Kirsty underwent a barrage of hospital tests to find out what was wrong after first seeing her GP at 15, including gastroscopies - where an endoscope (a tube with a camera at the end) is inserted into the stomach to inspect it. She was given the same treatments as adults - antacids to neutralise stomach acids, then proton pump inhibitors, drugs that suppress the amount of acid the stomach produces, but neither helped. By 17 Kirsty had lost about a stone in two years (she's 5ft tall), because eating had become so difficult, and her parents decided to see a private gastroenterologist. He carried out a gastroscopy and another test, which involved squirting water down her throat. They revealed Kirsty's lower oesophageal sphincter muscle had no strength, though she was told there was no reason for this. And no NHS doctors had previously even mentioned the muscle. In July 2014 she underwent a keyhole procedure to place a 'bracelet' of magnetic beads around the lower part of her oesophagus. The pressure of the food passing down the gullet gently pushes the beads apart; but the magnetic pull prevents food passing back up. The device, called the Linx band, is available privately and on the NHS at four hospitals in London and one in Devon. 'After surgery the team wanted me to use the muscle by eating soft foods which were easier to go down,' says Kirsty. 'When it didn't come back up I felt very emotional, knowing I could eat normally again.' Dr Emmanuel warns it may be too early to know how effective the Linx band is long term but added it was 'promising' as two-thirds of patients have come off other medication. Kirsty, who lives with fellow students in term time, says: 'I wouldn't have been able to go to university without the procedure - it's transformed my life.'","Kirsty Milne, 18, suffered from gastric reflux since she was 13 .

"President Barack Obama knew his criticism of Christianity at the National Prayer Breakfast would cause a commotion, a former senior adviser to the president, David Axelrod, contends. 'I think he knew what he was saying and he knew it was provocative,' Axelrod told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly during a Monday evening appearance. Axelrod, who served as the chief strategist on both of Obama's presidential campaigns and served as a top aide to the president at the White House in between, said Obama's 'point is we have a quarter of the world’s population Islamic and the vast majority of them have nothing to do with extremism.' 'And his point is let us not define that entire quarter of the planet by the actions of extremists, let's isolate the extremists,' Axelrod told O'Reilly. 'I think he knew what he was saying and he knew it was provocative,' longtime Obama associate David Axelrod said of the president's remakrs at the National Prayer Breakfast during an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly on Monday . Obama's 'point is we have a quarter of the world’s population Islamic and the vast majority of them have nothing to do with extremism,' Axelrod said . Speaking indirectly about radicalized Islamists,Obama implored his Christian audience at the annual Washington, D.C. gathering last Thursday to get off their 'high horse' and show 'some basic humility.' Expounding on the importance of reconciling the 'profound good, the strength, the tenacity, the compassion and love that can flow from all of our faiths, operating alongside those who seek to hijack religious for their own murderous ends,' Obama argued that 'there is a tendency in us ....that can pervert and distort our faith' and it is not 'unique to one group or one religion.' 'Remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ,' Obama said. Amid a barrage of attacks from the right, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters the next day his interpretation of the comments was 'that over the course of human history there are times where extremists pervert their own religion to justify violence.' The explanation did little to quell anger, particularly among conservatives. 'Everything he does is against what Christians stand for, and he's against the Jews in Israel,' presumed Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Monday on Fox and Friends. 'The one group of people that can know they have his undying, unfailing support would be the Muslim community. It doesn't matter whether it's the radical Muslim community or the more moderate Muslim community,' he charged. President Barack Obama commended German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday 'speaking out forcefully against xenophobia and prejudice and on behalf of pluralism and diversity.' Obama said, 'she’s made it clear that all religious communities have a place in Germany - just as they do here in the United States' Despite the blow back, Obama didn't appear chagrined on Monday afternoon during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Instead, he again addressed religious and cultural intolerance, and suggested that it is in effect a recruitment tool for extremist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS. The best people to prevent young people from falling prey to militant ideology are their 'local communities, families, neighbors, faith leaders,' Obama said. 'But we can help these communities, starting with the tone and the example that we set in our own countries.' Commending Chancellor Merkel for 'speaking out forcefully against xenophobia and prejudice and on behalf of pluralism and diversity,' Obama said, 'she’s made it clear that all religious communities have a place in Germany -  just as they do here in the United States.'","Axelrod served as the chief strategist on both of Obama's presidential campaigns and served as a top aide to the president  in between .

"Victim: Kim Howe, 69, died in the crash in Malibu, California on Saturday . This is the widowed 69-year-old woman who died in a four-car pileup this weekend involving former Olympian Bruce Jenner. Kim Howe was driving a white Lexus, which Jenner's Cadillac Escalade rear-ended Saturday on a segment of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. The car was pushed into oncoming traffic, and collided with a black Hummer, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant dead. Jenner was unharmed. Officials released Howe's image Monday, as it came to light that she had not had a valid driver's license since 2007. Howe's last permit expired that year, and she had never gotten another, the LA Times reported. It has also emerged that Jenner's Escalade had a sophisticated 'Black Box' inside, which contains critical data including speed and braking information to gauge what the driver was doing for the five seconds before impact, according to TMZ. As the other three vehicles will also hold similar data, accident reconstruction experts may be able to use them to determine if Jenner was following too closely behind the Lexus. More details also emerged about Howe's life in the wake of her sudden, violent death on the road. According to reports in the New York Daily News, she had lived alone since her husband, Robert, died in 2003. She had a pet dog, neighbors said, but the beloved animal had recently died. Howe, who was childless, was nonetheless 'very socially active', according to one member of the exclusive community in Calabsas, where she lives alongside the likes of Jenner's Kardashian stepdaughters. Jim Pascucci, a realtor who lived in the neighborhood, and also sold the Howes their $2.5million house, described her as 'sweet' and 'charitable'. He told the Daily News: 'She was just a very sweet lady. She was an animal activist. She loved dogs and was very socially active with that.' Smash: Howe was driving this white Lexus sedan, right, when it was pushed into oncoming traffic, causing the fatal collision . 'She was a very giving lady, very charitable. She and her husband didn't have any kids, so she put all her energy into that. Her husband left her very comfortable.' Detectives in Malibu continue to work on an investigation into the fatal wreck, with which Jenner is said to be cooperating completely. He took, and passed, a sobriety test immediately after the crash, and also gave officers a blood sample at a nearby hospital. Since the crash, Jenner has been seen on the roads again. Monday morning he made a Starbucks run in an inconspicuous Ford Fiesta. The former Olympian took the $14,000 compact car out for a spin today after a weekend under the public glare for his driving. Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation in the crash Saturday afternoon on the Pacific Coast Highway, CNN reports. If any of the drivers in the crash if found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison. On Monday, detectives said they are planning to ask Jenner to turn over his cell phone records to show whether he was texting while driving at the time of the crash - an activity that could net a vehicular manslaughter charge under California law, the Los Angeles Times reports. Trading down: Bruce Jenner swapped his $76,000 Cadillac Escalade and his $185,000 Porche for a $14,000 compact Ford Fiesta on Monday . Coffee run: It appears that Jenner is trying to keep a lower profile following the crash in Saturday, which left a 69-year-old woman dead and made headlines the world over . Jenner could also being trying to use the inconspicuous car in the hopes of going incognito as photographers follow him everywhere he goes . The Keeping Up With the Kardashians reality star has vehemently denied he was texting and driving and said he would gladly offer up his cell phone records to move it. At the time he was driving a $76,000 Escalade ESV, which was hauling a dune buggy. Jenner, who is in the midst of transitioning from a man to a woman, told police that he was taking a 'very low dosage of hormones that his doctor had prescribed,' a family source told Radar Online. The very next day, he was spotted out in his Porsche 911 GT3 RS - a 500hp supercar that costs about $185,000. Pictures from the outing published by the New York Post show Jenner speeding. He was driving at least 56mph in a 50mph zone, according to a digital speed limit sign on the road. It is unknown why Jenner opted to dramatically downgrade his set of wheels. The pictures were taken on Monday morning as Jenner hit Starbucks in Malibu for his morning coffee fix . Horrific: A sombre-looking Bruce Jenner surveys the crash scene on Saturday, including the mangled Lexus sedan that Kim Howe was driving when she was killed . Impact: Jenner's $76,000 Cadillac Escalade can be seen can be seen colliding with the white Lexus, which is thought to have been being driven by Ms Howe, a widow . One possibility is that he was hoping to go incognito in a low-profile car. The crash comes at a time when Jenner was already at the height of his post-Olympic fame as he prepares to publicly reveal that he is transgender and is becoming a woman. He reportedly claimed after the crash that it was the result of him being followed by aggressive paparazzi photographers. Investigators said that the paparazzi were not creating a danger and likely not a factor in the crash. It could be, too, that Jenner suspected that a less flashy care would attract less attention following two days in the spotlight for his habits on the road. On Sunday, Jenner released a statement that said: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident. 'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'","Kim Howe, 69, died in horrific crash in Malibu, California, on Saturday .

"It's not known for its budget-friendly accommodation - but prices for a night in the capital city are now the highest in Europe. As hotel rates in the UK soared by an average of nine per cent last year the average price for a room in London shot up to £126. Prices in London soared by 16.1 per cent taking it above Zurich in Switzerland and the only  place in the UK to average at over £100. The average price for a night in London is £100, making it the most expensive European city to stay in . The study, by online hotel reservations service HRS, showed that Leeds, which hosted the 2014 Tour de France, saw the biggest increase in hotel prices, up 21.6 per cent year on year. Edinburgh was the second most expensive city at an average of £99 per night, followed by Bristol at £87. The cheapest average room rates in the UK were in Birmingham and Liverpool, both £74. Jon West, managing director at HRS, said: 'These figures show that UK hoteliers are clearly reaping the rewards from an uplift in demand from both leisure and business travellers. 'This is great news for hoteliers who are able to charge more on average for their rooms per night, but obviously not so great for guests paying a premium.' Prices in the capital, known for its five-star accommodation such as the Savoy and Claridges, have shot up . New York - £157 . Washington - £130 . Rio de Janeiro - £128 . London - £126 per night . Edinburgh - £99 per night . Bristol -  £87 per night . It is thought that the global economic recovery, and increasing affluence in the Far East, saw more leisure and business travellers coming to the UK and London in particular. HRS explained that average rates had fluctuated 'significantly' in cities across Europe and worldwide. London beat Zurich into second place in the European rankings, with average rates in the Swiss city at £110 a night, whlie Paris came in third at £106. New York continues to be the world's most  expensive city to stay in, with an average room rate of £157 per night, while Washington came in second at £130 and Rio de Janeiro third at £128.

"Striking images have revealed new insights into how the kidney develops from a group of cells into a complex organ. In a time-lapse video, a mouse kidney is seen developing, with cells growing out like the branches of a tree. It is hoped the images will help scientists to understand the early stages of development in mammals. University of Edinburgh scientists took time-lapse kidney growth images. They reveal structures called nephrons branching out like a tree. These are instructed to do so by a key protein called beta-catenin. By altering the protein activity, the researchers found that they could instruct the kidney to grow differently . Researchers at the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute used time-lapse imaging to capture mouse kidneys growing in the laboratory on camera. They identified a key protein called beta-catenin that instructs cells to form specialised structures within the kidney. These structures - called nephrons - are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood to generate urine. Yesterday it was revealed that scientists had developed a transparent eggshell that allows the growth of an embryo to be monitored in a laboratory. While the ‘egg’ itself was artificial, the bird embryo inside is very much real - and allows the researchers a unique glimpse into how embryos develop . The method could be used to perform test drugs and techniques on embryos grown in this way, rather than performing tests on laboratory animals. The embryo featured in the video didn't hatch to grow into an adult bird, but scientists say their methods could allow embryos to be manipulated to understand how various biological processes work. Yellow areas in the video show where beta-catenin is most active, with higher concentrations instructing cells to form particular parts of the structure. The images reveal that a gradient in the activity of beta-catenin forms along the growing nephron. It is the concentration of the molecule that instructs cells to form each particular part of the structure. By changing the activity of beta-catenin in different places, the researchers learned that they could instruct cells to form the kidney in different ways. If nephrons do not work correctly, it can lead to a wide range of health problems - from abnormal water and salt loss, to dangerously high blood pressure. The findings will help scientists to grow nephrons in the lab that can be used to study how kidneys function. These pictures shows two different views of nephrons growing in the laboratory. On the left, the green and red areas highlight cells that filter waste products from the blood (shown in purple and red on the right. The blue/green section in both shows where urine is collected and taken away for excretion . Also, the use of time-lapsed imaging means that, rather than requiring different litters of mice to study different developmental stages, the same animals can be studied over time. This leads to a significant reduction in the number of animals needed for this type of research. 'This is the first time we have been able to identify the molecular signals that instruct cells exactly how to form functional nephrons,' said Dr Peter Hohenstein, of the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute. 'By using time lapse imaging, we can get detailed information about the signals that control how kidneys form at different time-points in development,' Dr Nils Lindstrom, of the University of Edinburgh, added. 'This means that we can use fewer animals and obtain much more information than normal imaging techniques.'","University of Edinburgh scientists took time-lapse kidney growth images .

"Secret Service Deputy Director Alvin Smith has been forced out of his position after 29 years in the agency . The Secret Service has forced out its deputy director, who has been with the agency for 29 years, as major house cleaning continues following a series of  highly publicized security breaches at the White House. Alvin 'A.T.' Smith, who managed the agency's day-to-day operations, will resign his position tomorrow but will be allowed to accept another unspecified federal job within the Homeland Security Department, the government said. Smith's firing follows a purge of the agency's upper management that saw the departure of six out of eight assistant directors last month, as well as the resignation of director Julia Pierson in October. Secret Service Acting Director Joseph Clancy called Smith's contributions to the agency 'invaluable' in a statement today. Department spokeswoman Marsha Catron said Smith will take a job with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit. She did not specify what Smith's job title would be or whether he would have a supervisory position. After Clancy removed the four assistant directors who oversaw protection, investigations, technology and public affairs last month, some members of Congress publicly questioned why Smith hadn't been fired as well, according to the Washington Post. Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz called Smith 'a part of the problem, not part of the solution', and said he worried the deputy director was at the center of the agency's recent bad decisions. Chaffetz and Maryland Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings commended the agency today for its recent job changes. Smith's firing is part of a major agency house cleaning led by acting director Joseph Clancy, who dumped four assistant directors last month after a report revealed the Secret Service was 'starved for leadership' The once elite Secret Service has suffered from a string of embarrassing scandals recently, including a drunk federal employee crashing a drone onto the White House lawn and a knife-wielding man that ran through most of the mansion's main floor before agent members could bring him down. The agency's woes only deepened in December when a panel selected by the Department of Homeland Security said the Secret Service was 'starved for leadership' and hurting from low morale. Following the report, Clancy said in a statement to the Washington Post that he believed the change was 'necessary to gain a fresh perspective on how we conduct business'. The White House has seen a string of security breaches in recent years, with over 40 fence jumpers making it on to the estate in the past five years, including four in just the last year. Other incidents have included a wandering toddler, a naked man, and eager reality stars. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs  and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for.","Alvin 'A.T.'

"David Cameron's plans to curb immigration do not go far enough and leave Britain at risk of 'immensely serious social dangers', a Conservative backbench manifesto claims. Brian Binley, treasurer of the powerful 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said tougher controls were needed on migrants' access to welfare and the jobs market. In a pamphlet for the respected Civitas think-tank, he said immigrants' country of origin should be made to pay for social security costs until they have made a significant contribution to the Exchequer. Scroll down for video . Brian Binley (pictured), treasurer of the powerful 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said tougher controls were needed on migrants' access to welfare and the jobs market . There would also be automatic deportation for anybody given a one-year prison sentence or two court fines – a far tougher regime than is currently in place. The document will increase pressure on the Prime Minister to toughen up the Tory Party's position on immigration controls. In November, Mr Cameron promised to stop EU migrants claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and getting access to social housing for four years. But he disappointed his backbenchers by stopping short of more robust action, including a temporary ban on migrants – the so-called emergency brake. It emerged that No10 dumped the idea after German Chancellor Angela Merkel made it clear it would not win EU support. In November, Mr Cameron promised to stop EU migrants claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and getting access to social housing for four years . The pamphlet by Mr Binley, one of the party's most senior backbench figures, reflects widespread concern among the rank-and-file that the UK has 'surrendered control over its borders'. It states: 'Emerging policies have failed to be wide-ranging and ambitious enough. Failure to address public immigration concerns would carry immensely serious social dangers.' Mr Binley, who co-authored the pamphlet with the academic Dr Lee Rotherham, continues: 'The free movement of workers as permitted under EU rules means that the UK has lost control of the supply side of its workforce. 'This would not be an issue but for the fact that it is subsidising its own native workforce to remain unemployed and our long-term uncompetitiveness by hiring in outside labour. 'This may be advantageous to the productivity of the companies in these areas, but it is disadvantageous to the taxpayer who has to effectively subsidise them by dole payments, while the UK workers affected fail to better themselves and rise up the employment ladder.' He also accuses Labour of 'cynically' encouraging mass immigration, adding: 'Those who endorse a level of mega-immigration that exceeds the ability of society to integrate the newcomers are deliberately attempting social change by different means.' Mr Cameron sparked controversy this year by excluding immigration from his six key election themes. The Office for National Statistics is expected to confirm this month that net migration is still 250,000 a year.","Brian Binley, treasurer of 1922 Committee, says PM too soft on immigration .

"Our universe, according to Einstein's theories, is around 13.8 billion years old and formed from an infinitely small point during the Big Bang. While most people accept this model, scientists still can't explain what happened inside this tiny point - called a singularity – or what came before it. Now, two physicists have put forward a radical new model which suggests the Big Bang didn't take place - and that our universe has no beginning and no end. Our universe, according to Einstein's theories, is around 13.8 billion years old and formed from an infinitely small point during the Big Bang (illustration pictured) While most people accept this model, scientists still can't explain what happened inside this tiny point - called a singularity – or what came before it . 'The math and the Big Bang theory itself break down because of the infinities,' Professor Saurya Das at University of Lethbridge, Canada told Dailymail.com. 'In other words, the theory predicts its own demise. It also does not explain where that initial state, came from.' To help solve this problem, the scientists combined general relativity, which describes the forces around us, with quantum mechanics, which governs small objects, according to a report by Lisa Zyga in Phys.org. They began with equations created by physicist David Bohm, who in the 1950s attempted to use quantum theory in place of classical equation to describe the shortest path between two points on a curved surface. The scientists began with equations created by physicist David Bohm (left), who in the 1950s attempted to use quantum theory in place of classical equations. They then combined this with an equation by Professor Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri at Presidency University (right) They then combined this with an equation by Professor Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri at Presidency University, in Kolkata, which described a fluid of small particles that pervades space. This fluid is the quantum version of gravity, which has dubbed a graviton by Professor Das and co-author Ahmed Farag Ali at Benha University. They showed that unlike classical trajectories - which are paths of particles going into the future or past – the quantum particles can never meet or cross. 'As far as we can see, since different points in the universe never actually converged in the past, it did not have a beginning,' said Professor Das. 'It lasted forever. It will also not have an end…In other words, there is no singularity.' But if there was no Big Bang, what is the history of our universe? 'The universe could have lasted forever,' speculates Professor Das. 'It could have gone through cycles of being small and big. 'Or it could have been created much earlier.' The theory may also potentially explain the origin of dark matter and dark energy. 'As far as we can see, since different points in the universe never actually converged in the past, it did not have a beginning,' said Professor Das. Pictured is a star cluster that popular cosmology believes formed following the Big Bang. The current research suggests stars such as this always existed . These elusive substances constitute respectively about 25 per cent and 70 per cent of our universe. 'We showed that a giant Bose-Einstein condensate of gravitons may have formed very early on, have lasted forever, and which accounts for both dark matter and dark energy,' said Professor Das. In the late 1990s, astronomers found that the expansion of the universe is accelerating due the presence of a dark energy. Their model has the potential to explain it since the fluid creates constant outward force that expands space. And when the team set the mass of the graviton, they could make the density of their fluid the same as the universe's observed density of dark matter. 'It is satisfying to note that such straightforward corrections can potentially resolve so many issues at once.' Professor Das told Phys.org.","Current physics can't explain what happened during the Big Bang .

"Tired: The Labour leader struggles to keep his eyes open during a photocall yesterday morning . He has confessed that he is not a morning person. So perhaps it was no surprise that Ed Miliband did not look his best as he held a dawn photocall yesterday. Looking tired and with his hair still a little unkempt as he visited a family for an early morning cuppa, the Labour leader seemed as though he was in need of the caffeine boost. Mr Miliband was discussing Labour’s plans to increase paternity leave with father-of-two Tom Gray, 44. They sat around a large wooden kitchen table with Mr Gray’s partner Sarah Phillis, 48, who is a storyteller, their sons Milo and Archie, and his mother, 71-year-old Ulla Gray. Joining Mr Miliband on the visit to the family’s £700,000 home on a leafy street in Peckham, south east London, was his deputy, Harriet Harman, who is the local MP. Mr Miliband eventually forced a smile as he posed in the very middle-class kitchen, complete with double oven, Union Jack biscuit tin and carefully positioned fruit bowls. The early morning visit came after Mr Miliband admitted at the weekend that he is not at his best first thing. ‘My secret is I’m not a brilliant morning person,’ he told the Financial Times Magazine, adding that he ‘does not like it’ if his two sons jump on him to wake him up. The next stop for Mr Miliband was the ITV This Morning studio, which probably left him feeling he had got out the wrong side of the bed as presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley introduced him with a video of his worst moments as Labour leader, complete with a dramatic soundtrack. ‘He failed to eat a bacon sandwich with dignity, but Ed Miliband is fighting back,’ Schofield told viewers as they were shown the embarrassing picture. Mr Miliband said: ‘I suppose what that shows is I’m not running to be the “photo opp Prime Minister”.’ Photo opportunity: The scene is carefully staged in a tidy middle-class kitchen, but Ed Miliband doesn’t quite look at home as he and Harriet Harman, right, discuss paternity leave with the Gray family yesterday . Miliband appeared on ITV show This Morning, where host Phillip Schofield brought up the infamous bacon sandwich photograph . Sleepy Ed: Miliband tries to stay awake as he discusses plans for new fathers to have a month off work . Miliband, pictured chatting with the Gray family, says he is not a 'morning person' and does not like his children jumping on him to wake him up . Schofield replied: ‘Isn’t that an essential part of the job – because you end up looking like Mr Bean if you get it wrong?’ Mr Miliband answered: ‘Thanks very much. The truth is that image of course matters, but the issues we face in this election are profound for people. ‘You’ve got so many people thinking the recovery has hit the City of London, but it hasn’t hit my kitchen table and that’s what I want to change.’ To make his bad hair day even worse, a poll of more than 1,000 viewers found 78 per cent did not see Mr Miliband as a future prime minister. Confronted with the results, Mr Miliband said: ‘I always say I want to be the first politician to under promise and over deliver rather than over promise and under deliver.’ Asked whether he regretted anything about his job, he said the long hours mean he has less time with his sons, who are four and five, and his wife, barrister Justine Thornton. He added: ‘My job as leader of the Labour party is important but my most important job is being a good dad.’ In documentary Inside The Commons, which will be screened on BBC2 at 9pm tonight, Mr Miliband also reveals that despite their political rivalry, he and David Cameron ‘often talk about our families... and compare notes on the struggle to combine being a politician with a family life’.","Ed Miliband looked a little worse for wear as he met a family this morning .

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will carefully avoid the media during his trip to the United Kingdom, on the heels of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's disastrous London swing a week ago. He is scheduled to have a private meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron on Tuesday, but unlike Christie he will not take questions from the media while he's overseas. Daily Mail Online asked his press secretary, Laurel Patrick, about interview opportunities and press conferences; she said neither would occur. 'Unfortunately, the Governor's schedule is extremely tight,' Patrick said, 'so we will not be able to accommodate (you).' NO QUESTIONS: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is preparing a presidential run, but won't speak to journalists in London during a trade mission there . NO IMMUNITY: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had a few rough days in the UK last week after he started a national freak-out over childhood vaccines . 'This is an official trip and the purpose of the trade mission is to promote foreign direct investment in Wisconsin, so it is vital that we keep the Governor's planned schedule.' She said before Walker left that the journey would be 'a business trip, not a photo op.' Walker is on an official state government trade mission until Friday, traveling with a group of Wisconsin government and business officials. But the trip will also give Walker a crucial chance to bolster his overseas and foreign policy credentials as he considers running for president in 2016. Christie's stock took a nose dive in the UK when he started a national furor over childhood immunizations after he was asked whether parents should have their children vaccinated. The news story quickly gathered momentum, with other potential presidential candidates being asked whether they believed – as Christie suggested – that parents should be allowed to opt out. 'Parents need to have some measure of choice,' he said. 'So that's the balance that the government has to decide.' Christie ended up canceling his final UK press conferences rather than endure more questions. A Senate panel held a hearing on Tuesday about the vaccine controversy. Walker will also deliver a speech at the prestigious Chatham House think tank on Wednesday about the global economy. His London trip is the third trade mission he has conducted since he took office in 2011, following visits to China and Japan. He has also said he is planning to visit Israel this year. PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER? Walker is carefully establishing his foreign policy bona fides, knowing that governors are usually thought of only in terms of domestic policy . 'Governors running for president need to show they have developed some foreign policy expertise since their jobs keep them at home most of the time,' Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, told CBS News on Monday. 'Voters know governors understand domestic issues, but half a president's job is coping with the complexities of global crises,' he said. 'Candidates can't be caught flat-footed on the trail and in debates when international topics are raised. Getting briefed by experts is one thing, seeing leaders abroad is quite another – and then the candidates can sprinkle their comments with first-hand experiences.' Other potential GOP presidential hopefuls have paid recent visits to London. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was there in January as part of a 10-day trade mission across Europe. He made news by pointing out that there are Muslim-dominated 'no-go zones' in England where police don't keep law and order. Then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio went last year. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who is the Democrats' front-runner, had a London stop during her book tour in the summer of 2014. The United Kingdom is Wisconsin's sixth largest export market; the state sends nearly $700 million worth of products to Great Britain each year. Wisconsin imported about $290 million in goods from the UK in 2013.","Wisconsin governor plans no press conferences in the UK and his handlers aren't allowing reporters to interview him .

"A biker has been banned from the roads after he crashed pulling a 70mph wheelie which was captured on two different cameras. Lee Oliver's headcam  filmed the moment he was flung from his bike and into the path of an oncoming van - which by pure coincidence had a camera fitted to the dashboard. The 38-year-old has now been banned from driving for four years and fined £1,000 after a court heard he and a friend had filmed themselves reaching speeds of 130mph. Idiot: Motorcyclist Lee Oliver was captured on two cameras crashing as he attempted this wheelie at 70mph . Tumble: Oliver, who was hurled from his bike and into the path of an oncoming van, suffered minor injuries . End of the road: The 38-year-old  was banned from driving for four years and made to pay £1,700 to the courts . Oliver was racing his friend Lee Cunningham, 39, other along country roads in Uckfield, East Sussex, on May 15 last year when he attempted the stunt. The pair from Horsham, West Sussex, had recorded their entire journeys including their speedometers - which meant police could prove what speeds they hit. Oliver clocked 130mph and Cunningham reached 137mph, including riding at triple the speed limit in a 30mph zone, Lewes Crown Court heard. Oliver then attempted the wheelie on a straight section of road and was hurled from his bike. Despite the van driver slamming on his brakes so quickly he was struck from behind, Oliver smashed into the vehicle and tumbled down the road for another 45ft. Headcam: Lewes Crown Court heard Oliver and friend Lee Cunningham filmed themselves reaching 130mph . Remarkably he suffered only minor injuries. Both bikers were banned from driving for four years after they admitting dangerous driving. They were also each handed 18-month suspended prison sentences, ordered to work 200 hours unpaid, fined £1,000 and made to pay £700 costs. Sergeant Huw Watts, from the Surrey and Sussex roads policing unit, said: 'When you watch the video, it seems amazing that Oliver escaped with just minor injuries and concussion. 'If he had come off his bike just seconds later he could have gone under the wheels of the van and been seriously injured or even killed. Two angles: This footage from Oliver's helmet camera showed the moment he flew from his bike . Tumble: Police said Oliver was just seconds from being flung under the van's wheels and killed . 'Motorcyclists are vulnerable road users who usually come off worst when they are involved in a collision but this case shows how some can put themselves at risk by abusing the fact that their machines can go fast and perform stunts. 'Every road user needs to think whether they are putting themselves in unnecessary danger and what they can do to avoid a trip to hospital.

"The U.S. Little League champions are being investigated after the runners up to the title accused the team of recruiting players from outside their district. Little League Baseball is looking into Chicago-based Jackie Robinson West for allegedly violating rule that prohibits the use of players who live outside the geographic area the team represents. Runner-up Las Vegas team Mountain Ridge Little League suggested that because of allegations, the Chicago team should be stripped of its 2014 title. Little League Baseball is looking into Chicago-based Jackie Robinson West (pictured) for allegedly violating rule that prohibits the use of players who live outside the geographic area the team represents. Runner-up Las Vegas team Mountain Ridge Little League (pictured) suggested that because of allegations, the Chicago team should be stripped of its 2014 title . Mountain Ridge President Kristi Black said that the team's U.S. title 'has an asterisk on it like the one on Barry Bonds' home run record', according to DNAinfo. She added that the Las Vegas team 'rightfully deserves to be recognized as the legitimate team that went the farthest'. Jackie Robinson West captured the attention of the country last summer for becoming the first team composed entirely of black players to win the U.S. championship. The team beat Las Vegas in the U.S. Championship, 7-5, to advance to the World Series where they faced Seoul, South Korea. The Nevada team had beaten Jackie Robinson West earlier in the tournament, 13-2. Despite their loss to a South Korean team in the World Series, the little leagues still earned a trip to the White House to meet President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, according to Washington Post. But since the games ended, groups from neighboring areas, as well as Mountain Ridge Little League, accused the team's officials of poaching standout players from other districts. Allegations have been made that Jackie Robinson West officials created a roster filled with all-star ringers, including players from the suburbs, and secretly expanded league boundaries in a move that helped the team win the title, according to DNAinfo.

Little League International found no evidence of wrongdoing, but the investigation has been reopened, according to ABC. New evidence was revealed last week when Little League officials met in Chicago, said DNAinfo. In 2013, Chicago's District 4 league, which included Jackie Robinson West, agreed on 'clearly defined' boundaries. Jackie Robinson West's 2014 boundaries, however, allegedly infringed on the territory of other leagues that was protected under Little League International agreements. After winning the U.S. Championship, the team made a failed attempt to ask sister leagues to change boundaries without Little League International's permission, according to DNAinfo. Per the organization's rules, boundary changes must be approved by district league presidents before they are submitted to the international organization. Jackie Robinson West's neighboring districts claim that the team expanded their league's boundaries to take over sections of three sister leagues to pick up star players.

"These pictures show France's latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net. In a demonstration flight in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month. The U.S. Secret Service was sent scrambling by the unexpected intrusion, but France has already faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites. Mystery drones have buzzed nuclear plants, military installations and even the presidential palace in recent months, as fears run high of terrorist attacks linked to the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency. Scroll down for video . Old fashioned solution: A Malou Tech drone Interceptor MP200, top, catches a drone DJI Phantom 2 with a net during a demonstration flight in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, France . Growing problem: After a spate of mystery overflights at sensitive locations, including nuclear sites, French officials recently asked scientists to devise ways to counter drones and detect their remote control pilots . Snared: Malou Tech's Interceptor merely drops a net over its prey, but officials are asking scientists for ways to monitor and detect intruding drones as well as analyse and track their flight paths . Concerned at the new technology, officials have asked scientists and companies to develop ways to monitor and detect intruding drones and their remote-control pilots; analyse and track their flight paths; and ultimately neutralise the drones, either temporarily or permanently, with the least collateral damage possible. Books closed on bids for the drone interception system last week, but so far it seems those lofty goals have not been realised. Indeed, the maker of the six-bladed drone with the net demonstrated yesterday for an Associated Press photographer has not even bothered to put itself forward. 'This is a technology phenomenon, not an aeronautical phenomenon', Philippe Dubus, head of drone maker Malou Tech, told the AP, adding 'within 18 months, whatever they come up with will be obsolete already.' Gotcha! Malou Tech pilot Philippe Dardini brings his drone Interceptor MP200 back to earth after it snared the DJI Phantom 2 drone. Malou Tech, a small drone-focused start-up, has not bid for the government work . 'This is a technology phenomenon, not an aeronautical phenomenon': Philippe Dubus, head of Malou Tech, who said, 'within 18 months, whatever they come up [to counter drones] with will be obsolete already' Civilian drones have become a 21st-century hobby for many, from high-tech aficionados to curious kids, and a hot seller. Companies like Amazon even want to use drones for deliveries. But their increasing presence in the skies gives headaches to national security chiefs. For months, France has faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites — mostly nuclear facilities, a worrisome development in a country that gets the highest percentage of its energy in the world from atomic power. French authorities say the drones currently present no threat. But some fear the drones could be spying on French technology or could one day be equipped with bombs or other weapons. Authorities have stepped up security at French nuclear sites and are investigating who might be behind the drone flights. The possible risks of rogue drones include terrorism, the invasion of privacy, the theft of industry secrets, and 'damage to the credibility of public authorities, institutions or companies,' said France's National Research Agency. The drone which crashed on the White House Lawn last month: Its pilot contacted the Secret Service the next day and said he had not intended for it to go near the White House and that he had been flying it for fun . A French security official said Germany, Britain, France and the U.S. were among the countries confronting the drone issue. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. State media in China say Chinese scientists have already developed a laser weapon that can detect and shoot down small, low-flying and slow-moving aircraft inside a 1.2-mile radius. Other anti-drone devices could include pinpoint radar systems to track drones the size of a breadbasket or even smaller (and distinguish them from birds); high-tech lasers to destroy the unwanted intruders or telecommunications-scrambling systems to block the remote controls that direct them. Interception drones, like the one made by Malou Tech, could be sent up into the sky to fight back and low-tech solutions such as sky-high netting or fences could also work, officials say. 'In other words, everything is possible,' said Mr Dubus.","Malou Tech Interceptor MP200 drops a net to ensnare aerial intruders .

"A woman who was arrested for ripping her boyfriend's scrotum with her bare hands during a brutal attack has been sentenced to two years in prison. Christina Lorena Reber, 46, from Indiana, was convicted last year of felony battery in connection with the March 2012 attack inside her 60-year-old boyfriend's home. She was ordered to spend two years in custody by a Circuit Court judge who said her ex-beau suffered 'an extraordinarily heinous injury' at her hands after she left his scrotum torn to shreds. Attack: Christina Lorena Reber, 46, pictured, from Indiana, was convicted last year of felony battery in connection with the brutal attack on her 60-year-old boyfriend's testicles . According to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun the man's scrotum was left with a long wide tear which had been completely torn loose from his body. During his bedside interview at Ball Memorial Hospital in Muncie, Indiana,  cops said that his shirt was also covered in blood. And when investigators checked in on the man two days after the attack, he reported that his bleeding scrotum was so swollen that he was unable to walk and was missing work. The man, who has not been named, said that he had broken up with Reber several days before the assault. He told police that on the day of the attack he was at home working on his computer when Reber walked into his house uninvited and began punching him in the head. He described how she grabbed hold of his scrotum, dug her fingers in, and began squeezing it as hard as she could causing him incredible pain. Treatment: During his bedside interview at Ball Memorial Hospital in Muncie, Indiana, cops said that his shirt was covered with blood and he later had to have stitches and undergo reconstructive surgery . Using her fingers to continually dig in to his scrotum, the victim said that she refused to let go or release her grip. He recalled that the pair then began fighting and both fell to the ground giving him the opportunity to pry his testicles from her hands. The man received stitches at Ball Memorial Hospital, but subsequently required reconstructive surgery. He has suffered ongoing pain since the attack.","Christina Reber, 46, from Indiana, was convicted last year of felony battery .

Culture clash: Mr Badawi was arrested in 2012 for offences including insulting Islam and disobeying his father - a crime in Saudi Arabia - after discussing greater religious and political tolerance online . The father-of-three received the first 50 lashes last month and had been expected to receive a further 50 each week, but further beatings have been withheld without explanation. Before he set off on a six-day tour of the Gulf, Amnesty International urged Charles to seize the opportunity of his visit for 'a frank discussion of human rights.' And today sources confirmed to the Mail that the heir to the throne had discreetly tackled the subject with Saudi's new king. Charles chatted for some 20 minutes with King Salman, who acceded the throne following the death of the 90-year-old former ruler, King Abdullah last month, before sitting by his side at a lavish state lunch. Some 300 VIP guests had been invited in the prince’s honour and the group feasted on more than 25 dishes including Longface Emperor Fish, a whole lamb and Om Ali-Kenafa, a local desert with cream.

Described by one senior British diplomat as ‘providing not just the continuity here, but the continuity that matters’, Charles had the red carpet rolled out for him by every senior member of the kingdom’s ruling royal family. British ambassador Simon Collis said he was sure that the prince's visit would have a 'significant impact'. He continued: 'Royal to royal links have a particular value. He arrives as a frequent visitor and somebody with longstanding relationships in place. Any conversation that does happen is not just going to be an exchange of platitudes because they are past that.

Within hours of the king dying, Charles was on a private jet to Saudi Arabia to pay his respects. Prince Miteb said: ‘When you came on the first day after the king died it meant a great deal to us. The family were very grateful to your Government and to the Queen. ‘He [the late king] was always taking about the Queen and her mother.’ Prince Charles shakes hands with the new ruler of Saudi Arabia King Salman at the Al Ergah Palace in the country's capital Riyadh . Officials said that Prince Charles was good at raising human rights issues without making the Saudis 'bristle' Saudi prisoner Raif Badawi, whose case Charles raised with the Saudi king today, ran a website that encouraged Saudis to debate both politics and religion. His Free Saudi Liberals online forum – which has now been closed – criticised Saudi Arabia's clerics and claimed that a university in the country had become 'a den for terrorists'. In 2013, after Badawi's wife and children fled to Canada, he was cleared of apostasy, the rejection of Islam, which could have carried a death sentence. But he was found guilty of 'insulting Islam' and 'going beyond the realm of obedience'. The father of three received the first 50 lashes on January 9, and he was expected to receive 50 more every week for the following 19 weeks. Amnesty International say the second 50 lashes have been delayed. It was reported that the wounds had not healed, and his wife said that as a diabetic who suffered from hypertension, he may be unable to physically withstand another flogging. Protests were held outside Saudi embassies across the world and Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, raised the case with Saudi ambassador Prince Mohammed Bin Nawwaf Bin Abdelaziz last month. However Amnesty has accused the UK of being 'muzzled' by its commercial and strategic links with the kingdom and of failing to object strongly enough. Earlier after arriving at the airport, Charles then went to the Al Yamama Palace, where he held a bilateral meeting with Crown Prince Murqrin bin Abdulaziz, right . As part of a traditional welcome to Saudi Arabia, the Prince of Wales was served arabic coffee and dates by his hosts . The Prince enjoys his Arabic coffee at a ceremony with the the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia earlier today . Unnamed British diplomatic sources say the Prince's intervention in the Badawi case might carry more clout given his royal status . Saudi Arabia beheaded a convicted Syrian drug smuggler today, bringing the number of executions in the kingdom this year to 27. Authorities carried out the sentence against Abdullah Mohammed al-Ahmad al-Anzi for trafficking amphetamine pills, the interior ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. He was executed in northwestern Jawf region. The government says it is keen to combat narcotics due to their 'great harm' but the kingdom has faced constant international criticism over its human rights record, including its use of the death penalty. Anzi was the latest of 27 foreigners and Saudis executed this year, according to a tally. The Gulf nation executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013, AFP's tally showed. Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under the kingdom's strict version of Islamic sharia law. Ambassador Collis was present as Prince Faisal earlier escorted Charles through an assembled Guard of Honour in Royal Terminal of Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport. The prince and his entourage were served traditional Arabic coffee and dates as part of a traditional welcome, before heading off for a formal bilateral meeting with the Crown Prince followed by his head to head with the king. Meanwhile Mr Collis described Saudi Arabia as a being 'key strategic partner' in the coalition against ISIS and the fight against terrorism more generally. He said: 'At the same time as a government we stand for the rights of people everywhere to have freedom of expression and for human rights more generally. 'Against the background of that overall relationship, we have serious concerns about the Raif Badawi case. We have raised that and we will continue to raise that. ' He added of Charles: 'The Prince of Wales is a long standing and frequent visitor to Saudi Arabia he has been been many times. 'I am very much aware as an ambassador, Prince Charles will know most of these people much better than I do. He will be the judge of what he raises and how and when he raises it. Raif Badawi (pictured) was handed down the sentence of 1,000 lashes after criticising the country's Sunni clerics on his blog . Charles has undertaken his whistle-stop tour of the Gulf states at the request of the Government. He is accompanied by four of the FCO's most-senior officials, including Director for the Middle East, Edward Oakden, a sign of the significance of his mission in fostering good relations between the UK and the Gulf States. He arrived in Jordan at the weekend before moving onto Kuwait and will also take in Qatar and the UAE before he leaves.","The Prince landed in Riyadh and was greeted by Prince Faisal bin Bandar .

"Leaving the European Union is the biggest threat facing Britain, Ed Balls warned today. Labour's shadow chancellor accused the Tories of 'flirting with exit' and warned walking away from Europe would be a 'disaster'. Mr Balls sought use his speech to the British Chamber of Commerce to repair Labour's reputation on the economy after coming under attack from business leaders. Scroll down for video . Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls accused the Tories of 'flirting with exit' and warned walking away from Europe would be a 'disaster' David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. But the Labour party has refused to match the promise, warning it would create uncertainty for business. One shadow cabinet minister has admitted: 'Opposing a referendum is our only policy which businesses like.' Today Mr Balls warned that Britain has succeeded by being an international trading nation and 'to walk away from Europe - our biggest trading market - would be a disaster'. He told the BCC conference in Westminster: 'Britain must lead the debate for reform in the EU. Banging the table for change and for the EU to work better for Britain. But not flirting with exit and putting party interest above the national economic interest. 'Because Britain walking out of the EU is the biggest risk to our economy in the next decade. EU exit risks British jobs, trade and investment and the future prosperity of the UK. 'And every comment by senior Cabinet ministers saying they would be happy or relaxed to see us walk out, and every hint that a referendum could happen as early as next year - before any meaningful reform agenda could be achieved - only adds to the uncertainty and risk for British businesses.' Labour leader Ed Miliband faced claims he had snubbed business after not speaking at the confeence . Labour leader Ed Miliband today faced claims he had 'snubbed' business leaders after not turning up to the British Chambers of Commerce conference. The Lib Dems claimed his absence was 'astounding' after a week in which Labour has been accused of being anti-commerce. BCC chief John Longworth said the Labour leader's absence from the conference was 'disappointing'. He told Sky News: 'It was disappointing because I think it was a great opportunity, a platform for the business community, businesses from all over the country, to set out the case.' Labour sources stressed that Mr Miliband was not 'dodging' business leaders and had already appeared at 10 economic conferences, including the Confederation of British Industry's in November last year, which Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg also spoke at. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls dismissed suggestions of a snub to business from the Labour leader as a 'silly story'. He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'This is really scraping the barrel of trivia. Ed Miliband has spoken to the British Chambers of Commerce twice in this parliament, he spoke to the CBI a few months ago, he's at the Engineering Employers Federation in a few weeks' time.' 'I was there, as was Chuka Umunna, setting out a pro-wealth creation message, but pro-wealth creation which will change things so it works for working people. 'The Tories don't want that debate, and they certainly don't want to have a debate about HSBC or about their policies on Europe which are putting off investment and damaging jobs, so they make up these silly stories.' Labour leader Ed Miliband is now widely seen as anti-business, with captains of industry who once backed Tony Blair now warning of the disastrous impact of a Labour victory in May's election. Industry leaders credited with the success of well-known chains including Boots, M&S, Pizza Express and Lastminute.com have turned their fire on Labour in recent days, warning victory for Mr Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe. But Mr Balls insisted that Britain faces 'difficult and risky and rather dangerous times' and called for a 'straight conversation about the risks we face'. He argued that Labour would be 'pro-business, but not business as usual'. He added: 'Promoting competition, not turning a blind eye to bad practice. Supporting wealth creation, but making sure everyone pays their fair share.' The shadow chancellor argued that with working people £1,600 a year worse off than in 2010, more needs to be done to ensure rising prosperity for all. He said: 'This is set to be the first time since the 1920s when working people are worse off at the end of the Parliament than they were at the beginning. 'So at a time when, even as our economy recovers, most people are not yet seeing the benefit in their wages and living standards, this is no time for complacency. 'If we are to win the argument that Britain can succeed in an open global economy, we have to show that our economy can deliver rising prosperity for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules. And that is not what people think is happening in our country at the moment. 'I want an open and competitive tax system that rewards work and supports entrepreneurs and long-term investment and wealth creation.' The Tories have been forced to deny plans to hold the in-out referendum as early as next year, insisting time is needed to secure a better deal with Brussels. Conservative Chancellor George Osborne insisted that Britain 'wants to stay in a reformed European Union'. He told Bloomberg TV: 'The European Union needs to change so that it's a continent where jobs are created, prosperity is created. 'We also need to make sure that the relationship with members of the EU who aren't in the euro, like the United Kingdom, is a fair one. 'So those are our priorities going forward and we said that we will put this to the British people in a referendum. We said that that referendum will take place at the end of 2017. As the Prime Minister said earlier this year, if we can conclude the negotiations sooner, then we would be delighted.' Conservative Chancellor George Osborne insisted that Britain 'wants to stay in a reformed European Union' British Chambers of Commerce director-general John Longworth said the issue should be resolved one way or the other within 12 months of the general election in May. Like the other main business organisations, the BCC is strongly in favour of Britain's continued membership of the EU. But in an interview with the BBC, Mr Longworth said the country could not afford to wait until the end of 2017 - the final date by which David Cameron has pledged to hold a referendum if the Tories regain power - to decide the matter. 'We need to bring the referendum date forward because two and a half years of uncertainty isn't good for growth and investment,' he said. 'It should be no more than 12 months after the general election.'","Shadow chancellor accuses the Tories of 'flirting with exit' from the EU .

"President Barack Obama's claim that a gunman who last month killed four French Jews inside a kosher deli 'randomly' selected the location and his targets came under heavy scrutiny today at a White House briefing, with multiple reporters badgering the president's spokesman to admit a tie between the victims' religion and their murders. In an interview with Vox published on Monday Obama said, 'It is entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you’ve got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris.' Today the White House Press Secretary argued that his boss merely meant to say they 'were not specifically targeted' and 'were individuals who happened to randomly be in this deli.' Scroll down for video . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest found himself in several testy back and forths with reporters this afternoon over the president's claim that victims of a kosher deli shooting in Paris were 'randomly' targeted . The shooter, Amedy Coulibaly, told French television station BFM-TV in a newly released interview that he picked kosher grocery Porte de Vincennes because, according to the station , 'he was targeting Jews' The shooter, Amedy Coulibaly, told French television station BFM-TV in a newly released interview that he picked kosher grocery Hyper Cacher because, according to the station, 'he was targeting Jews.' A journalist with the station says he also explained 'why he did this: to defend oppressed Muslims...notably in Palestine.' 'He claimed to be part of the Islamic State [ISIS] very clearly,' BFM reporter Sarah-Lou Cohen said of the phone conversation with Coulibaly. 'He said he had instructions from the caliphate. And then another very important element, evidently, as we were saying in the afternoon, he established a link with the Kouachi brothers.' Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, the brothers allegedly behind the attack on the Paris-based satirical publication Charlie Hebdo, were later killed in stand off with police, as was Couilbaly. Coulibaly's ties to ISIS are documented by a propaganda video taped by his wife, possibly a co-conspirator in the grocery store siege, in which she calls for French Muslims to carry out additional acts of terror. The White House found itself in several testy back and forths with reporters this afternoon over Obama's statement - provided to Vox more than a week ago but released just yesterday. First asked about Obama's remark by CNN's Jim Acosta, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest replied, 'I believe the point that the president was trying to make is that these individuals were not specifically targeted.' He added: 'These were individuals who happened to randomly be in this deli and were shot while they were there. And that is the point that the president was making.' Flabbergasted, ABC News' Jon Karl pressed Earnest to confirm that president believes the deli goers' Jewish heritage were related to the assault. 'It is clear from the terrorists and some of the writings they've put out afterward what their motivation was,' Obama's spokesman told him. 'The adverb that the president chose was used to indicate that the individuals who were killed in that terrible, tragic incident were killed not because of who they were, but because of where they randomly happened to be.' Terrified hostages - including women and children - run for their lives as four captives die in dramatic end to siege at this Hyper Cacher kosher grocery store last month . Not satisfied, Karl again pointed out that they were in a kosher deli when they were killed, moments later contending that even if they weren't personally targeted they were attacked because of their religion, to which Earnest told him 'there were people other than just Jews who were in that...deli.' 'Does he have any doubt...that deli was attacked because it was a kosher deli, it was not any random deli, it was a kosher deli,' Karl eventually shouted at Earnest, who interrupted him to say, 'no,' Obama does not doubt that. Picking up where Karl left off, seconds later Fox News' White House Correspondent Ed Henry asked, why then, 'didn't the president acknowledge that? If he knows that, and it's obvious, why didn't he say that?' 'The president has acknowledged that on many occasions when he's had the opportunity to speak about this incident,' Earnest tersely told him . 'But he didn't there!' Henry noted before moving on to another topic.","In an interview released Monday Obama referred to 'violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris'

"Business: Simon Geddes, a former council IT specialist, and his wife Joanne, pictured together, made counterfeit T-shirts and  bags in their home . A couple made £180,000 by selling fake Disney, One Direction and Justin Bieber merchandise in an online scam from their living room. Simon Geddes, 44, a former council IT specialist, and his wife Joanne, 42, made counterfeit T-shirts and gym bags in their home in Sedgley, West Midlands. They printed Disney, Hello Kitty, Justin Bieber and One Direction logos on to merchandise before selling them on Amazon and eBay, a court heard yesterday. The Geddes', who used a stolen laptop for operation, earned £180,000 from the illegitimate business, with the purchases being processed through Paypal. The couple were spared jail at Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday. The court heard how they had initially set up a legitimate enterprise called 'Baby Smiles' to sell personalised gifts. They later started offering fake goods to unsuspecting customers that were printed with trademarked logos downloaded from company websites without permission. The images were transferred onto the items using heat presses before being sold online using a  laptop stolen from Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, where Mr Geddes used to work. Mrs Geddes admitted 23 offences relating to making and possessing items with intention to sell counterfeit goods, and one offence of money laundering between July 2011 and November 2012. Mr Geddes pleaded guilty to 11 offences of aiding and abetting his wife to make counterfeit goods, and one offence of money laundering. The pair  were both sentenced to 15-month jail terms for each offence, suspended for two years yesterday. Recorder Sandra Bristoll also ordered the couple to undertake 120 hours of unpaid work. Prosecutor Mark Jackson told the court the crimes came to light after Newport City Council made test purchases of items from eBay. He said: 'At about the same time Dudley Council had a number of complaints about Baby Smiles' goods. 'The whole investigation was passed to Dudley Trading Standards. On November 22, 2012 officers with a search warrant went to the property. Counterfiet: The Geddes', who used a stolen laptop from Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council (headquarters pictured) for the operation, earned £180,000, with the purchases being processed through Paypal . 'A number of counterfeit items were seized and heavily packaged parcels ready to post were opened. Each had counterfeit goods inside.' Stephen Amblet, defending Joanne Geddes, who used to work in a bank, said the the pair had been naive. He added: 'This business pays tax and is registered for VAT. 'The problem is that she did not know she was doing anything wrong or she would have checked.' The court also heard the business www.babysmiles.co.uk is still trading, but in legitimate goods. Spared jail: The pair were both sentenced to 15-month jail terms for each offence, suspended for two years at Wolverhampton Crown Court, pictured. They were also ordered to undertake 120 hours of unpaid work . After the case, Dudley Council's cabinet member for legal matters Councillor Rachel Harris said: 'We take incidents of counterfeit goods being sold very seriously and work very hard to bring offenders to justice. 'We were made aware that one of our staff was involved in such activities in his own time and away from the workplace, and a full and thorough investigation took place. 'The former employee was dismissed as an ICT project manager in February 2013. 'The offences were dealt with at Wolverhampton Crown Court and we are pleased this matter has finally concluded.'","Simon and Joanne Geddes started business selling personalised gifts .

"A Republican Federal Communications Commission board member is blowing the whistle on his government agency's plan to adopt so-called net neutrality rules. The FCC's chairman announced last week that he would not allow the public to review the Obama-supported regulations before the five-member board, made up of three Democrats and two Republicans, takes a vote on them later this month. Republican commissioner Ajit Pai pushed back on the decision today by holding a press conference to disparage the FCC's 332 page 'secret plan' to take control of the Internet that he cautioned would bring about 'adverse consequences to the entire Internet economy.' Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai today pushed back on a the chairman of the FCC's  decision today by holding a press conference to disparage a 332 page 'secret plan' that he cautioned would bring about 'adverse consequences to the entire Internet economy' President Barack Obama jump started the debate on the controversial net neutrality policy in November by publicly calling on the independent federal regulatory agency to put new rules on internet companies that would stop them from creating fast lanes for certain content providers and slowing down the rate at which data from other sources reaches consumers. 'For almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access into and out of your home or business,' Obama said. 'It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information — whether a phone call or a packet of data.' Democrats on the commission, with Obama's blessing, want to expand the 1934 Communications Act, updated in 1996, to include the internet by classifying it as a public utility. A similar plan by the FCC was struck down by a federal court nearly a year ago. It put forward a new plan in May, but Obama argued that it wasn't strong enough and pushed in November for the FCC to adopt more stringent rules. Internet steaming companies have mostly sided with Obama out of fear that service providers could one day begin charging customers higher rates to receive their content, while the internet providers that would come under new government scrutiny as a result of the measure have fought against it. Republicans are also staunchly opposed to the move, which they equate to a power grab by the unelected group of bureaucrats. The commissioners on the FCC are appointed by the sitting president for five-year terms and must be confirmed by the Senate. Typically, the president's party holds three seats on the commission while the minority party keeps two. 'This is not only a direct attack on the free market, but it will also result in an increase in Internet access fees for millions of consumers in America. It’s a massive tax on the middle class, plain and simple,' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said Monday in an email for anti-net neutrality group Protect Internet Freedom. 'President Obama wants to take something that’s working just fine, and tie it up in red tape--sound familiar? We've seen this movie before--it's called ObamaCare,' Paul charged. In another email sent by the group to potential supporters, Utah Sen. Mike Lee called the proposed rule a 'government takeover of the Internet' and contended that companies would pass the costs associated with the mandate on to consumers. 'This is essentially a massive tax increase on the middle class, being passed in the dead of night without the American public really being made aware of what is going on,' he claimed, before contending that an unregulated internet is 'incredibly important force for freedom. 'I am not accusing anyone of sinister motives here, but I am deeply concerned about the idea of any government bureaucrat having the power to tell companies what they can and cannot do. In the long term, this could have a chilling effect on political speech, in ways that today we could not even begin to imagine,' he wrote. Last week Pai tweeted this photo of himself holding the massive set of rules Democrats on the board of the FCC want to slap on internet service providers. The FCC's chairman has barred the board's members from releasing the plan to the public before a Feb. 26 vote . American Commitment, a conservative organization that fiercely opposes net neutrality, urged Congress last week step in and even suggested that it 'shut down the FCC entirely. 'A supposedly independent agency,' it 'has embarrassingly become an appendage of White House political staff,' Phil Kerpen, president of American Commitment said. He accused the president of 'imposing sweeping new taxes and destroying private investment, competition, and innovation while putting bureaucrats firmly in control.' The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has indicated that it intends to open up an investigation into the FCC's dealings with the White House to make sure 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue didn't attempt to improperly influence the independent agency's decision-making process. In an op-ed last week FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler officially announced his intentions to bring for a vote the 'strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC.' 'My proposal assures the rights of internet users to go where they want, when they want, and the rights of innovators to introduce new products without asking anyone’s permission,' he said. Wheeler has embargoed the contents of the plan however preceding the Feb. 26 vote and barred his fellow commissioners from releasing the document to the press. At his press conference today, GOP commissioner Pai stuck to the rules and refused to give reporters a copy of the document under review. 'I simply cannot release it on my own as much as I would love to,' he said. Instead, he issued doomsday warnings based off his own reading and warned 'that consumers that use less data may end up subsidizing consumers that use more data' and have 'less choice and less free data' if the plan is put into effect. 'My bottom line, if you like your current service plan, you should be able to keep your current service plan,' he said. 'The FCC shouldn't take it away from you.' Referring to the proposal as 'President Obama's plan,' Pai said it 'gives the FCC broad and unprecedented discretion to micromanage the Internet.' 'This plan gives a Washington bureaucracy a blank check to decide how Internet service providers deploy and manage their networks from the last mile all the way through to the Internet backbone.' Like other Republicans who oppose net neutrality rules, Pai said they would 'open the door to billions of dollars in new taxes on broadband' that could climb as high as $11 billion. 'I foresee adverse consequences to the entire Internet economy,' he predicted,' that will put burdens on everybody across the entire landscape.' Pai affirmed that he would vote against the measure later this month. 'Today the Internet is open and free and consumers are able to access the lawful contents of their choice,' he said. 'In my view, neutrality rules are a solution in search of a problem.'","The FCC's chairman won't allow the public to review the Obama-supported regulations before the five-member board .

"At least 876 American children aged 10-19 took their own lives in 2013 with a gun, marking a 12-year peak in firearm suicides according to a new report from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The study, released on Monday and based on data from the CDC, found that the majority of the deaths - 82 percent - involved a weapon that belonged to a family member, in most cases a parent. The increase in gun suicides by young people reflected a growing rise in the number of suicides generally among that age group. Suicides have grown for the past three years after dipping after 2001 and now it is the second leading cause of death among children and teenagers after car deaths. It replaced homicide as the number two cause. Twelve year peak: Using data from the CDC the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence study reveals suicides by guns are at a level not seen in more than a decade . The data on the number of young gun suicides was taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and according to the Brady Center is proof many of the death's are preventable. 'Millions of Americans have a gun in their homes thinking that it makes their family safer, but every day in our nation, dozens of these families learn just how dangerous and tragic that miscalculation can be. 'The bottom line is: having a gun in the home dramatically increases the danger that a child will be shot and killed.' Indeed, with more than 80 percent of the deaths caused by a gun owned by a family member, the center said that removing weapons from the home or better gun education is key to reducing this figure. On the rise: The study also showed that suicides by firearms are on the rise and have been on the increase for three years . Correlations: In states where there are least weapons the suicide by gun rate is lowest. In states where there are more guns, it is highest . 'One of the most significant ways we can address this serious public health and safety issue is to educate parents about the risks of unsafe access to guns in the home,' said Gross. 'Parents are the first line of defense against gun violence, so we all need to realize the risks and take the appropriate steps to make sure our kids do not have unsafe access to guns.' 'Every day, 48 children are wounded or killed by gunfire.' said Dan Gross. The report also revealed that most annual total gun deaths occurred in states with the highest rates of gun ownership such as Louisiana and Wyoming. Conversely it showed that the states with the fewest number of annual firearm deaths such as Hawaii and New York had the lowest gun ownership rates. 'One of the most significant ways we can address this serious public health and safety issue is to educate parents about the risks of unsafe access to guns in the home. 'Parents are the first line of defense against gun violence, so we all need to realize the risks and take the appropriate steps to make sure our kids do not have unsafe access to guns.'","Study from Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence released on Monday .

"A Georgia man who shot dead his ex-wife and two of their children had fought over child custody. Cedric Prather Jr.'s shooting rampage began just after 3 p.m. on Saturday. Prather, 33, parked about a quarter mile away and walked inside the suburban Atlanta home of his ex-wife, Latoya A. Andrews, police said. Those who knew him say his three children were his whole life, but when he lost his job as a truck driver recently, the pressure to support them may have led him to snap and kill them, his sister said Monday. Family: Latoya Andrews, 30, was shot dead by her abusive ex-husband during a rampage where her boyfriend and two of their children were killed. It is not known which of the children pictured were among those killed . Haunting: Cedric Prather, 33, pictured center with Latoya and their children, was seen pacing outside the house before he went inside and starting shooting . Prather had enough ammunition to shoot even more people, the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office said Monday. At some point during the shooting spree he stopped to reload the .45-caliber handgun, Capt. Bruce Ferguson said. Prather gunned down Andrews and her boyfriend, Joseph Terry Brown, and killed two of Prather's children, including one who begged him not to pull the trigger, police said. He also shot two other children, leaving them critically injured. He then killed himself in the street. 'His children were his life,' Prather's sister Jerdonna Sawyer told The Associated Press. 'He wasn't crazy at all. He just chose a terrible way to deal with his pressure and his stress.' Prather left no note explaining his actions, Douglas County sheriff's Capt. Bruce Ferguson said. 'I can't tell you why he did it,' Ferguson said. 'All I can do is to say he snapped or he had enough is what we've concluded in our investigation.' Horrifying: After gunman shot Andrews (pictured) and her family members he turned the gun on himself. Neighbors said some of the victims were left dying in the street . Tragic: Andrews (left) and her boyfriend Terry Brown were pronounced dead at the scene . According to the Atlanta Constitution Journal, Prather, the father of all of the children involved, had driven to the house dressed in black and paced up and down outside before barging in. Three of the girls then ran from the house, with the eldest begging him to stop, before they were all shot. Residents nearby said they were then left bleeding in the street before Prather turned the gun on himself. The family's eldest son, a teenager, was playing basketball at the time of the shooting, and did not find out what happened until he was on his way home. The victims were supposed to attend, the paper reported, but they did not make it. Teresa Carter, 59, said she heard the gunfire from inside her home but did not see what happened. Police said victims were shot inside and outside the home. Carter said she often saw the children playing in the driveway and around the neighborhood. They enjoyed petting her dog. 'I heard shots, and I heard the girl scream,' Carter said. 'And then I heard four more shots.' Brandon Hallman was working on a car a few houses down when the shooting started. 'I heard a couple quick shots, you know, back to back to back. Went out there and, you know, looked and it was already over,' Hallman said. 'We just grabbed some towels and kind of went down there to try and help before the paramedics got here.' Heartbreaking: The man accused of killing his ex-wife, her boyfriend and two children had enough ammunition to shoot even more people, the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office said Monday . Vigil:Three of the girls then ran from the house, with the eldest begging him to stop, before they were all shot . Tragedy: A family portrait sits by the fireplace inside a home as police investigate the shooting scene . A motive for the shooting has not been released, however police twice visited the pair's house in 2013 responding to a domestic abuse complaint. Neighbor Nick Cook added: 'It was over the stupidest things. It was over child support and taxes.' A GoFundMe page raising money for Ms Andrews' surviving children pays tribute to the family. 'Saturday Febrary 7th 2015 was a very tragic day. We had to say goodbye to three beautiful people,' writes the group administrator Jenny Brown. Another neighbor, Angela Ansah, struggled to explain to her own children what happened to their slain friends a few houses down. Ansah said some of the children targeted Saturday often came over to her house to play with her own children. 'These are children I see every day, every blessed day,' Ansah said. Douglas County Sheriff's Lt. Glenn Daniel said authorities received a 911 call Saturday afternoon suggesting there had been a shooting in Douglasville. Prather left the military when Andrews was pregnant with their first child to be with her and help support the family. He moved about a dozen miles down the road to Douglasville from Villa Rica to be closer to his children after he and Andrews divorced and she moved, even though it meant moving farther from his close-knit family, Sawyer said. He felt enormous stress from trying to be a provider and a parent, and that was exacerbated recently when he lost his job as a truck driver because his driver's license was suspended, Sawyer said. Shaken community: At some point during the shooting spree, Cedric Prather stopped to reload the .45-caliber handgun, police say. Prather used the same gun to then shoot and kill himself . Silhouette: Another portrait hangs on the wall inside the home as forensics comb the scene . Horrifying: Neighbors described how paramedics were treating victims as they lay in the street. A police officer holds his hand over his face as he stands in the doorway . Court records show Prather and Andrews divorced in 2006, and Sawyer said the two had gone back and forth over their children since then. Andrews got a protective order against him a year and a half ago, court records show. Prather killed his 7-year-old daughter, London, and 9-year-old son, Jeremiah. He also critically wounded Andrews' 15-year-old daughter, Demeshia Owens, and Brown's 7-year-old daughter, Jada Brown. Prather's oldest child, a 13-year-old boy, was not home at the time. Andrews had asked judge for a temporary protective order in August 2013. At one point, she wrote, Prather forced his way inside her locked home when she was there alone. He also pinned her down on the stairs and sexually assaulted her, she wrote in a court filing. Investigation: A detective stands in the doorway of a home hours after the murder suicide . Area: Police stood round the cordon late into the evening following the deadly shooting . The court documents didn't indicate whether criminal charges were ever sought, and there is no record of charges. The judge ordered Prather to stay away from Andrews and her home. Meetings for him to pick up and drop off the children were to take place in the Douglasville Police Department parking lot, according to the order, which expired October 9. In December 2013, the state officials said in a court filing that Prather owed $31,800 in past-due child support. He and Andrews eventually reached a custody agreement in last May that allowed the children to spend about half their time with their father. A few months later, the court issued a final order for him to pay $437 a month in child support and pay a past-due sum to be determined. Police said the pair also fought about taxes but could not provide any more details about that. Prather used a .45-caliber handgun to shoot all the victims and himself, and stopped at least once to reload. The sheriff's office is working with federal authorities to see if he bought the gun legally. Prather's family is feeling deep grief and is also heartbroken for the families of Andrews and Brown, Sawyer said. 'We're all hurting,' she said. 'We've all had a great loss.'

"The Queen was a breath of spring in cold mid-February in a pale floral suit at a reception at Buckingham Palace this evening. Her majesty was hosting a bash in honour of the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who both recently turned 50, and the work they do to support a wide range of charities. 375 guests attended the event from organisations including the National Youth Theatre, The Commonwealth Games Federation, The London College of Fashion, The Craft Guild of Chefs, The British Paralympic Association, MENCAP, the Shooting Star Chase children’s hospice and the Northern Ballet. The Queen hosted a party in honour of the Earl and Countess of Wessex and work they do to support a wide range of charities at Buckingham Palace this evening, which was attended by 375 guests. Before the event started, the Duke of York posted a picture of his mother, brother and sister-in-law in the Queen's private apartments onto Facebook . The Queen spent some quiet moments with close family members in her private apartments before they headed out to meet the guests. Her second eldest son Prince Andrew, 54, captured the moment on his mobile phone and uploaded the photo to his Facebook page. The Duke of York captioned it: 'A family photo before we join the guests at my brother and sister-in-law's joint 50th Birthday Reception at Buckingham Palace, to recognise the important work with their many organisations - AY.' Stars including Dame Esther Rantzen, Sheridan Smith and Matt Lucas rubbed shoulders with charity workers and members of the British Army at the event.

The Countess wore a simple black dress with a pearl and diamante shoulder embellishment by Victoria Beckham, which she offset with a pair of diamond stud earrings. Her hair was swept up in a loose chignon that framed her face. Prince Edward looked very smart in a dark blue suit, complete with pale blue pocket square and a brown polka dot tie.

The singer Sophie Ellis Bextor was also invited to the event . Dame Esther, 74, who was present because of her work with ChildLine and the NSPCC, even delayed her first meeting with her newborn grandchild to be there. She said: 'My second grandson was born at 7.30am and the reason that I am not at his bedside is because I am here. 'My son (Dr Joshua Wilcox, the baby's father) has forgiven me. 'I was able to say to Edward that the name of my grandson is Edward. But unlike His Royal Highness, he will be known as Teddy. 'He was a bounding 9lb 1oz and at dawn I get on the train to go to Torquay to admire him.' Sophie Ellis-Bextor wore a simple baby blue dress to meet the Queen while Matt Lucas favoured a blue pinstripe suit and Sheridan Smith opted for a green shift dress . Sophie and the Queen share a joke while they wait for their guests to arrive . Dame Esther, who has attended the palace on numerous occasions through her charity work, described the value of royal support to a charity as 'almost unquantifiable'. She said: 'When people work every minute of every day with a commitment to a particular cause - admittedly they do it because they are dedicated. 'But to be able to shake hands with a member of the royal family is in a way the nation saying thank you.' The guest list at the event reflected Edward's interest in the arts and sport, his military appointments and his links with the Duke of Edinburgh's Award and International Award Foundation. It also marked Sophie's work with charities that help families, young people and children tackling avoidable blindness. Staff, volunteers and charity representatives were also present from The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award, Girlguiding, England Hockey, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness and the Association of Show and Agricultural Organisations.

"Drivers at drunken-driving checkpoints don't have to speak to police or even roll down their windows. They just have to place their license and registration on the glass, along with a note saying they have no comment, won't permit a search and want a lawyer. At least, that's the controversial view of a South Florida attorney. Warren Redlich contends the commonly-used checkpoints violate drivers' constitutional rights. He and an associate have created a website detailing their tactics. Scroll down for video . Controversial: DUI attorney Warren Redlich contends  drivers  don't have to speak to police officers at drunk-driving checkpoints and that the checkpoints violate drivers' constitutional rights . They've even made videos, one viewed more than 2.4 million times on the Internet, of their refusals to interact with police. Doubts over the legality — and wisdom — of the tactics have been expressed by legal experts and local authorities. Redlich, of Boca Raton, said his goal is not to protect drunken drivers, but to protect the innocent. He says some of his clients who passed breath-alcohol tests still faced DUI charges because the officer said he detected an odor of alcohol or the person had slurred speech. 'The point of the card is, you are affirmatively asserting your rights without having to speak to the police and without opening your window,' he said. Not surprisingly, this does not sit well with law enforcement officials who insist drivers must speak in order to make the checkpoints work. And, they point out the U.S. Supreme Court in 1990 upheld the use of random DUI checkpoints, concluding they don't violate constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure. 'They wouldn't be allowed out of that checkpoint until they talk to us. We have a legitimate right to do it,' said Sheriff David Shoar of St. Johns County, president of the Florida Sheriffs Association. 'If I was out there, I wouldn't wave them through. I want to talk to that person more now.' License and registration: Police officer Luis Ortiz looks at a driver's license he requested  during a drunk-driving checkpoint in Miami in Junary. A South Florida DUI attorney contends the commonly-used checkpoints violate driver's constitutional rights . The widely viewed video was shot December 31 at a checkpoint in Levy County, Florida, by Redlich's associate Jeff Gray. In it, Gray approaches the officers with the flyer, his license, registration and insurance card in a plastic bag dangling outside the slightly open car window. The officers briefly examine it with a flashlight and then allow him to continue. In bold type, the flyer states: 'I remain silent. No searches. I want my lawyer.' Police across Florida have seen the video. A spokeswoman for a large metro police agency says Gray's experience at the checkpoint doesn't mean the no-talk tactic is legitimate. 'He was allowed to proceed because he clearly was not driving while intoxicated,' said Veda Coleman-Wright, spokeswoman for the Broward Sheriff's Office. 'If those officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver was impaired, they would have investigated further.' There have been other incidents of motorists refusing to speak at DUI checkpoints around the country. Right to remain silent: Warren Redlich holds up a flyer he designed during an interview in Delray Beach, Florida, in January. The attorney contends drivers do not need to speak with police at DUI checkpoints . Fair DUI: Attorney Warren Redlich holds a book he wrote during an interview in Delray Beach, Florida . In the Southwest, some drivers resist cooperating at Border Patrol checkpoints miles from the Mexican border that are aimed at finding immigrants in the country illegally. Based on differences in DUI laws, Redlich has created versions of his flyer for 10 states with more on the way. There are no comprehensive statistics on how many drunken drivers get caught at checkpoints, which are usually announced publicly in advance and must adhere to a strict set of court-approved rules. For example, the Miami-Dade Police Department uses a 'neutral' method of selecting which drivers get stopped, such as every single vehicle or maybe every third vehicle. The Miami Police Department uses the 'chute' method in which 10 cars are randomly diverted from a busy thoroughfare to a side road and checked simultaneously by officers, followed by 10 more. At a recent checkpoint, Miami Police Sgt. Luis Taborda said it's as much about deterrence and visibility as making DUI arrests. Taborda has frequently brought bad news to a family when someone is killed or seriously injured by a drunken driver. Stop: A Miami police officer guides vehicles through a drunk-driving checkpoint in Miami . 'I'm the one that has to knock on somebody's door and see the pain that person has to go through,' he said. Legal experts said it's unclear whether Redlich's tactics will hold up in court. David S. Weinstein, a former Miami state and federal prosecutor now in private practice, said most states consider driving a privilege and drivers give up some rights. 'You may have to roll your window down and interact with officers,' Weinstein said. 'These guys are all pushing the envelope.' Redlich, however, said to his knowledge his flyers have been successful every time they have been used. His goal is not to challenge or confront police, he said. 'I'm not anti-cop. I'm anti-bad government and anti-bad cop. I support good cops,' he said. 'I would like if police didn't waste their time with something like checkpoints and would focus their attention on violent crime.'

"Singles looking for a little affection on Valentine's Day can get some much-needed physical contact  at this year's first annual Cuddle Convention. But don't get any bright ideas because the event is strictly non-sexual. Cuddle Con will happen  on Saturday at several locations in Portland, Oregon and feature several workshops, classes and speakers. But the highlight will be an afternoon 'snuggle party' expected to be attended by about 100. Valentine's day plans: A Cuddle Convention will be held in Portland, Oregon this Valentine's Day. The event's organizer Samantha Hess pictured on the right in a previous broadcast about her cuddling business . Samantha Hess is the woman behind the event and she says that everyone attending the party will need to go through a 30-minute consent class before entering the cuddle room. In the class, cuddlers will be briefed on what types of touch are appropriate and how to communicate with each other. Only those 18 and up will be allowed to participate and nudity is prohibited. Ground rules: Hess says those who attend the convention's cuddle party must go through a 30-minute consent class where they will be briefed on appropriate touching . 'It has rules - it's touch that would be appropriate to do in front of children, basically,' Hess told the Oregonian. ' The space is big enough for about 100 people at a time.' 'Usually there's a lot of laughing, and sometimes we will get these things we call ""puppy piles"" with lots of people all just snuggling together. 'There will probably also be some people just chatting in the corner, too. It's not all cuddling.' The idea for Cuddle Con came about two years ago, when Hess had just finished going through a trying divorce and saw a man advertising free hugs on Facebook. At the time she thought she would definitely pay someone money just for a hug. That led her to start her own business, Cuddle Me Up, where she provides platonic cuddles to clients. The business has been so successful in Portland that she recently had to hire three more female workers. One of her clients is 47-year-old Kimberley Jenson who plans on attending this year's Cuddle Con. 'I hated Valentine's Day, and now I am looking forward to it. I am hoping to cuddle non-stop,' Jensen told CNN. 'Just because I don't have someone in my life doesn't mean I don't deserve affection and touch,' she added. Hess believes this year's Cuddle Con will show the many benefits of platonic cuddling, for both singles as couples. In addition to the snuggle party, Cuddle Con will also feature partner yoga, acro yoga, a dance lift class, a blues dancing class, a breathing class, a posture class and a massage class. Tickets to the event start at $25.","Cuddle Con will take place at several locations in Portland, Oregon this Saturday .

"2015 is the year of friendship between books and films, with Australians flocking to bookstores to purchase novels which have been transformed into blockbusters. In a trend which has escalated in recent years, book publishers are now more likely to release a film tie-in edition of novels to coincide with movie releases. Dymocks’ National Buying Manager Sophie Higgins said that the enduring power of celebrity and film can have an enormous influence on book sales, which almost always increase when they hit the cinema. 50 Shades of Grey has sold 65 million copies worldwide and is in the top ten bestseller list for 2015 . E.L. James’ bestselling Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, which include Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, is certainly no exception to this, creeping into the top ten bestseller list in January. The book occupied the number one bestseller spot for 21 weeks in 2012, selling 65 million copies worldwide, and has now seen a renewed interest due to a film tie-in which is set to premiere on February 12. 'Fifty Shades of Grey was a bestseller for so long I can’t quite believe there are still people left in Australia who haven’t read the thrilling love affair of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele!' said Ms Higgins. According to Ms Higgins, approximately one in ten Australians own or have read the first book, with more showing interest each day as the film premiers draws near. The film adaptation of 50 Shades of Grey is set to premiere on February 12th . American Sniper has been adapted into a film starring Bradley Cooper and a new edition has been released . 'It's intriguing how the film will bring the characters to life, which helps with conversations around the book,' Ms Higgins said. 'Some women seem to be having fun with it around Valentines Day, and from what I can pick up are going to see the movie with their girlfriends instead of having a traditional celebration,' she said. The enduring power of film to reach a broader audience than may have originally been reached with the books first release. Eight of the top 10 bestselling titles at Dymocks were film tie-ins, with Gone Girl or American Sniper holding the number one spot for all of 2015. 'Films based on non-fiction books such as American Sniper and Unbroken give a broad overview of the story, but the books give so much more detail,' Ms Higgins said. Ms Higgins said that rather than books and films competing against each other for audiences, they actually complemented each other. Angelina Jolie directed the film adaptation of Unbroken, a non-fiction book which has seen an increase in sales . Many non-fiction books allow for greater detail to be given than in the films . 'A films release almost always renews interest in the book. Publishers didn't use to release film tie-ins, and the trend started with Twilight and used to be reserved for Young Adult books,' she said. 'Now, almost every single movie based on a book will get a new edition.' Films also open up books which can seem to be niche stories to much wider interest through the actors involved in the productions. 'Wild, which stars Reese Witherspoon, can seem like one woman's story about her hike across America, but the film makes the book much more appealing and universal,' Ms Higgins said. 'Unbroken, which was directed by Angelina Jolie, received incredible publicity when she mentioned it was based on a true story,' she said. Other novels which have been out for several years, such as Gone Girl and The Imitation Game, have also seen increased sales. As different facets of the same story are highlighted through the differing mediums, films and books appear to be the perfect pairing for a new year of entertainment.

"Most homeowners hit by flooding are faced with just two options - clean up and hope it doesn't happen again, or move out. But one determined couple whose island home was wrecked when the Thames burst its banks last year have come up with a new idea - shifting their five-bedroom house 5ft into the air. Yaron Ivry and his wife Sigal have spent almost £80,000 jacking  their riverside property in Wraysbury, Berkshire, up onto stilts, and filling in the gap with breeze blocks. Yaron Ivry and his wife Sigal (pictured together) spent almost £80,000 jacking their Thameside property in Wraysbury, Berkshire, up by five feet to prevent it from a repeat of last year's winter flooding. Here the house is seen in its finished state, having been put on stilts and the new basement underneath the property bricked up . Over the course of ten days, a team of engineers lifted the 80-ton building up into the air, using a steel cradle and 28 computerised jacks which pushed the house upwards at a rate of three inches an hour. Now, a year after the house was devastated by floods last January, work is complete with the house protected from the waters of the Thames, and the Ivry family enjoying a new basement underneath their home, as well as a new kitchen, replacing the one which was left underwater when the river breached its banks. 'It's fantastic,' Mr Ivry, 59, told MailOnline. 'It's great. We are back in the house now and the work is almost all done. 'There is still some work inside but it's nearly there. 'We have created a new basement under the house in the space where the stilts are and that will be useful for storage and we have a new kitchen. 'It is better than we could have ever imagined, with under floor heating, and a better view out over the river. Mr Ivry hired specialist builders who created a network of steel beams under the house which would hold its weight as the property began to lift. Holes were bored into the brick walls, shown here, so supportive beams could put up both inside and outside the building . 28 super-strong jacks — each capable of supporting 50 tons — were placed underneath the steel cradle. A diamond-edged saw then sliced horizontally through all the brick walls below the level of the concrete floors, severing the building from its foundations . 'Every day I look out of the window and I smile and feel happy because I am safe.' Mr Ivry, a former engineer and owner of telecommunications business D-Mobile, his wife, 49, their 17-year-old daughter Ayala, and dog Prince live on an island between the River Thames and an artificial water channel, which left them vulnerable to flooding. When water poured into their home last January it caused £125,000 in damage, with the house's hardwood floor, ground floor walls and electrics wrecked beyond repair. As the rain poured down, Mr Ivry's garden was left underwater and even though he tried to set up barricades at his garage and front door, he was unable to stop the water gushing in, leaving the ground floor under nearly half a foot. 'We are sitting on an island, so when the water comes up it comes from all sides,' he said. 'When we were flooded we were an island surrounded 360 degrees by water. 'It was devastating.' The self-employed couple lost a year of business because they could no longer work from their home. Mrs Ivry, who runs a jewellery distribution company, said: 'I was hoping right up until the last minute we would not have to move. 'We thought maybe we could stay and live upstairs, but after a day we realised it was not realistic, when the smell starts. The windows and walls of the home were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains, and work began to lift the house slowly into the air - with the family's belongings still inside. Work to lift the house began after planning permission was granted last June . With the perimeter ring of steel steadying the structure and pressure spread evenly over the hydraulic jacks (pictured), no one part of the building was exposed to particular stress as it was lifted from the ground at a rate of three inches an hour . 'The house became all humid and stinking - it was not healthy.' The value of the house - which had been worth £1 million - dropped to £750,000 as it could not be insured against future floods. Now, after the £80,000 project the house is thought to be worth between £1.5 million and £2 million. 'My view was that if I did nothing it would end up costing me and I would lose a lot of value on the house because I could not insure it,' he said. 'But if I did something, if I put in £80,000 to save the house, I would definitely get it back if I did decide to sell it. 'Plus I could insure the house and I could live in it safely.' Father-of-three Mr Ivry had considered sealing the house with a barrier, waterproof doors and pumps to get rid of any ground water or leakage, but worried that just one tiny crack would mean water pouring into his home again. 'I could have spent £35,000 and I wouldn't know if it would even work,' he said. He also considered demolishing the house completely. The value of the house - which had been worth £1 million - dropped to £750,000 as it could not be insured against future floods. Now, after the £80,000 project the house is thought to be worth between £1.5 million and £2 million. It took ten days to lift the house to its agreed height . 'It would have cost me maybe £400,000 to rebuild it , and I would need to find somewhere else to live,' he said. 'So I took up the challenge of lifting it and researching on the internet I saw that it had been done with a concert hall in Shanghai. 'People were sceptical and wanted to see if it would work, but I knew that if it was done properly it then the risk would be almost nothing.' After getting permission from the local council, Mr Ivry hired specialist builders who created a network of steel beams under the house which would hold its weight as the property began to lift. Holes were bored into the brick walls and supportive beams put up both inside and outside the building. Then, 28 super-strong jacks — each capable of supporting 50 tons — were placed underneath the steel cradle. A diamond-edged saw then sliced horizontally through all the brick walls below the level of the concrete floors, severing the building from its foundations. With the perimeter ring of steel steadying the structure and pressure spread evenly over the jacks, no single part of the building was exposed to particular stress as it was raised. Finally, all the windows and walls were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains, and work began to lift the house slowly into the air with the family's belongings still inside, although they moved out into a rented flat nearby. The newly-formed gap at the bottom of the house was then filled with breeze blocks, and the steel cradle removed before the breeze block basement was concealed with reclaimed London yellow bricks, designed to match the rest of the house. Mr Ivry's newly-raised front door now has a long staircase leading up to it, protecting the entrance to the house from any flood water . Around the back of the family's house, two former patio doors will soon become a raised decking area for barbecues. The family were able to move back into their home in October . The couple say the transformation is 'unbelievable', and their higher home means they enjoy a better view of the river . His front door now has a long staircase leading up to it and around the back of his house two former patio doors, which are now suspended from mid air, will soon become a raised decking area for barbecues. Work on the main structure was completed in August, and the family were able to move back in last October. Mr Ivry's home, which the family have lived in since 1998, is thought to be the first in Britain to have been lifted in this way, and he has been visited by officers from the Environment Agency eager to learn from his project. His neighbours, many of whom were forced to leave their homes in last January's floods, have also turned to him for advice on how to protect their own homes from any future damage. '2014 was total chaos,' said Mr Ivry. 'I could not work, by wife could not work and we were out of our home. 'Now 2014 is behind us and we are looking forward to the future. 'We are so happy that we have done it and the house is unbelievable.' As the rain poured down, Mr Ivry's garden was left underwater and even though he tried to set up barricades at his garage and front door, he was unable to stop it gushing in. The house was badly hit by last year's floods, with the hardwood floor, ground floor walls and electrics wrecked beyond repair .

"Nearly six months after allegedly leaving her newborn baby to die in a garbage can, a Salt Lake City woman has been ruled incompetent to stand trial because she has an IQ of 51. Since Alicia Englert's two-day-old daughter was found in her neighbor's trash bin in August, there has been an ongoing debate on the 23-year-old's mental state at the time of the incident. Englert maintained an online dating profile throughout her pregnancy and online photos appear to show her drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing in the months before her daughter was born. But based on court-ordered evaluations and the testimony of two mental health experts, Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills ruled on Monday that Englert is mentally disabled and has an IQ too low for her to legally stand trial on a felony attempted murder charge. Scroll down for video . Court-ordered evaluations found that Alicia Englert, 23, is mentally disabled and has an IQ of 51 - too low for her to legally stand trial for allegedly leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can near Salt Lake City . Since the incident in August, there has been an ongoing debate on her mental state at the time of the incident. Englert maintained an online dating profile throughout her pregnancy and photos appear to show her drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing in the months before her daughter was born . Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills said Englert will enter treatment. The judge set a new hearing date for June 8 to re-assess whether she's become competent for trial . Utah law says a defendant must have an IQ of 70 to face trial. Below 70 is considered an 'intellectual disability', licensed psychologist Karen Malm told Fox 13. Though Malm did not conduct Englert's competency evaluation, she told Fox 13 that the score of 51 suggests that Englert functions at a level of a ten- to 12-year-old child. Englert was able to finish high school, but a single in-depth conversation shows she didn't function at typical adult level, lawyer Josie Brumfield said. In a Wechsler IQ Test, an 'average classification' score is between 90 and 109. An attorney for Englert's parents called for the charge to be dismissed. 'She doesn't understand the gravity of what took place, and the finding of incompetency confirms that,' Jessica Peterson said. Judge Hruby-Mills said Englert will enter treatment. The judge set a new hearing date for June 8 to re-assess whether she's become competent for trial. Prosecutors will take another look at the case to decide what happens next, Salt Lake County District Sim Gill said. Court documents say Englert gave birth in a bathroom at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns and left the baby girl without food or medical care for a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash on August 26 . In some cases, defendants are able to face charges after treatment, but sometimes the setback for prosecutors is permanent, he said. Utah law says a defendant must have an IQ of 70 to face trial. Below 70 is considered an 'intellectual disability' Court documents say Englert gave birth in a bathroom at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns and left the baby girl without food or medical care for a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash on August 26, 2014. Prosecutors say the infant would have died if she had not been found by a neighbor who thought she heard a cat purring in the garbage. The baby was suffering from hypothermia, respiratory distress and a blood-borne infection when she was found. Englert's father, Robert said at the time that his daughter had a learning disability and didn't understand the pregnancy or the implications of abandoning the baby. Her baby was flown to a hospital and placed on a ventilator, but she recovered and is being adopted. Judge Hruby-Mills granted a supervised 90-minute goodbye visit for Englert and her family in December, a fairly common allowance for parents whose rights are terminated after their children are taken into state custody. Fox 13 reported on Englert's 'Meet Me :)' online dating profile, which stated she didn't have any children. In full, her 'About Me' section read, 'hi my name is alicia im 23 years old I work full time I have brown hair im 5'1 I have no kids I do drink but only on the weekends I have my own car I still live with my mom and dad for now!!! if you want to know more just ask ;)' Licensed psychologist Karen Malm told Fox 13 that although did not conduct Englert's competency evaluation, the score of 51 suggests that Englert functions at a level of a ten- to 12-year-old child . Jessica Peterson, an attorney for Englert's parents, said the woman 'doesn't understand the gravity of what took place' and that the competency exam findings comfirm that . Her profile appears to still be active, though most of the information has been deleted. Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Gill said. Englert's lawyer argues that she had a difficult childhood - her mother went to prison when she was about 18 months old. 'She kind of got lost in the cracks, really didn't get any help or treatment,' Brumfield said. Englert has not entered a plea. She appeared in court on Monday with her parents wearing a black jacket and green blouse, and did not take questions from reporters. She remained free on bail after Monday's hearing, and state authorities will evaluate Englert to decide what form her treatment will take, Brumfield said. But Robert Englert, said in September that his daughter had only just started to realize what she had done. 'She doesn't even realize that it's a crime and it's bad,' Englert told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'Even when the police were taking her to jail, she thought they were taking her to her room.' Her father, Robert Englert said at the time of the incident that his daughter had a learning disability and didn't understand the pregnancy or the implications of abandoning the baby .","Alicia Englert, 23, 'gave birth on August 24 and left the baby girl alone in the bathroom without food or medical care while she went to work'

"A heartfelt birthday message from Johnny Cash to his beloved wife June has been voted the greatest love letter of all time. The simple, but plainly expressed missive in which the singer dubbed the Man in Black writes 'you're the object of my desire, the #1 Earthly reason for my existence,' has topped a list of passionate penmanship. Written in 1994, the letter beat notes by Keats, Churchill, Jimi Hendrix and the great Hollywood lovers Richard Burton and Liz Taylor. Johnny Cash's birthday letter to his wife June in 1994 has been voted the greatest love letter of all time . In the Valentine's Day poll, the country music legend Johnny Cash's letter in which he writes to 'the greatest woman I ever met' on his wife June Carter's 65th birthday was regarded as the most moving. In it he wrote, 'We got old and got used to each other. We think alike. We read each others [sic] minds. We know what the other wants without asking. Sometimes we irritate each other a little bit. Maybe sometimes we take each other for granted. 'But once in a while, like today, I meditate on it and realize how lucky I am to share my life with the greatest woman I ever met. 'You still fascinate and inspire me. You influence me for the better. You're the object of my deskre, the #1 Earthly reason for my existence. I love you very much.' Winston Churchill's words of undying love to his 'darling Clemmie' in 1935 came second. Despite his many wives King Henry VIII makes an appearance in the list confessing his love to his second wife Anne Boleyn in 1527. Poet John Keats came in third place with his letter to his next door neighbour Fanny Brawne telling her that he couldn't live without her in 1819 . Composer Ludvig Van Beethoven takes eight place as pens his love for his 'Immortal Beloved' whose true identity remains a mystery . The much-married monarch, who later had his wife executed, wrote: 'I beg to know expressly your intention touching the love between us. Necessity compels me to obtain this answer, having been more than a year wounded by the dart of love, and not yet sure whether I shall fail or find a place in your affection.' Poet John Keats may be famous for his odes but he only manages third place on the table despite his way with words telling his next door neighbour Fanny Brawne that he can not live without her in 1819. Jimi Hendrix's letter to his 'little girl' comes in at tenth as he encourages her to 'spread her wings'. The recipient of the letter is unclear but still earns itself a place in the top spot. The poll to discover our favourite romantic message was commissioned by British life insurance company Beagle Street to encourage Brits to be more romantic on February 14. In the battle of the sexes, it was men who came out on top in the romance stakes with nearly one in four (24 per cent) saying they have sent a love letter within the last year. But after 38 per cent of women admitted that they had never written a love letter, 46 percent declared the tradition outdated. Gerald Ford earns himself ninth place on the list with his letter to wife Betty after her cancer diagnosis . Londoners proved the most romantic in the country with 74 percent claiming to have penned a love note, while in the North East it was just 55 percent. Beagle Street's managing director Matthew Gledhill says that a hand-written note is still appreciated even in the modern age. 'A well-written love letter can stand the test of time and be a permanent record of affection so it is important the tradition doesn't die out. 'We hope our research inspires people who have never written a love letter to take some time out and write down and share exactly how they feel with a loved one.' 1. Johnny Cash wishes wife June Carter Cash a happy 65th birthday (1994) 'We get old and get used to each other. We think alike. We read each others minds. We know what the other wants without asking. Sometimes we irritate each other a little bit. Maybe sometimes take each other for granted. But once in awhile, like today, I meditate on it and realise how lucky I am to share my life with the greatest woman I ever met.' 2. Winston Churchill tells wife Clementine Churchill of his undying love (1935) 'My darling Clemmie, in your letter from Madras you wrote some words very dear to me, about having enriched your life. I cannot tell you what pleasure this gave me, because I always feel so overwhelmingly in your debt, if there can be accounts in love.' 3. John Keats tells next door neighbour Fanny Brawne he can not live without her (1819) 'I cannot exist without you - I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again - my Life seems to stop there - I see no further. You have absorb'd me.' 4. Ernest Hemingway professes his love to Marlene Dietrich (1951) 'I can't say how every time I ever put my arms around you I felt that I was home.' 5. Napoleon Bonaparte sends his love to Josephine de Beauharnais (1796) 'Since I left you, I have been constantly depressed. My happiness is to be near you. Incessantly I live over in my memory your caresses, your tears, your affectionate solicitude. The charms of the incomparable Josephine kindle continually a burning and a glowing flame in my heart.' 6. Richard Burton tells Elizabeth Taylor of her beauty (1964) 'My blind eyes are desperately waiting for the sight of you. You don't realize of course, E.B., how fascinatingly beautiful you have always been, and how strangely you have acquired an added and special and dangerous loveliness.' 7. King Henry VIII expresses his love for Anne Boleyn (1527) 'I beg to know expressly your intention touching the love between us. Necessity compels me to obtain this answer, having been more than a year wounded by the dart of love, and not yet sure whether I shall fail or find a place in your affection.' 8. Beethoven pens his love for his 'Immortal Beloved' whose true identity remains a mystery (1812) 'Though still in bed, my thoughts go out to you, my Immortal Beloved, Be calm-love me-today-yesterday-what tearful longings for you-you-you-my life-my all-farewell. Oh continue to love me-never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved. Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours.' 9.

"Witnessing a meteor blaze across the night sky is awe-inspiring. So is seeing a comet, nebula or star cluster . But what if you could see all of them, at the same time, in the same image of the cosmos? That’s the amazing celestial montage apparent in this stunning long-exposure photograph, showing various  phenomenon alongside some of their more Earthly companions. Use slider below to reveal the space phenomena . In the centre of the image is Comet Lovejoy, which made its closest pass to Earth in January 2015. Elsewhere a nebula shaped like the state of California and another surrounding a runaway star are seen. Move the slider to switch between the annotated and blank image . The image, released by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), was taken above the La Silla Observatory, on the outskirts of the Chilean Atacama Desert. It was captured by Photo Ambassaador Petr Horálek during a visit to La Silla in January 2015. Using a series of long exposures, he snapped the stunning views of both the observatory and the celestial objects above. - A meteor . - Comet Lovejoy . - The Pleiades star cluster . - The California Nebula . - The Pan-American Highway . - The Flaming Star Nebula . - Oxygen airglow in the upper atmosphere . - Low altitude clouds . - La Silla Observatory . Towards the centre of the night sky in the image is a green object, Comet Lovejoy. Formally designated C/2014 Q2, it was discovered by Australian astronomer Terry Lovejoy and made its closest approach to Earth on 7 January. On this day it was just 43.6 million miles (70.2 million km) from Earth, and was captured in amazing images by astronomers all over the world. The comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign. In this instance with the comet, it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green. To the naked eye, though, the comet will appear grey; it is only cameras using a long exposure that bring out its green colouration. The comet is of particular interest because it is a 'long period' comet - one that originates from the outermost reaches of the solar system, the Oort cloud. To the left of the comet in the image is an unnamed meteor burning up in the atmosphere. The European Southern Observatory has revealed this amazing image taken above an observatory in Chile. The montage reveals many different cosmic phenomena above the La Silla Observatory . Every day about 100 tons of meteoroids, which are fragments of dust and gravel and sometimes even big rocks, enter Earth’s atmosphere. When these burn up in the atmosphere they can produce a brief streak of light, which becomes known as a meteor. On rare occasions the meteor will make it to Earth’s surface, when it becomes known as a meteorite. Recently, many scientists have said we should do more to track incoming space rocks, and prevent a potential catastrophe if a big enough rock makes it to the ground. In 2011, for example, a previously unseen meteor passed through the atmosphere and exploded above the Russian town of Chelyabinsk. The resultant shockwave injured hundreds of people and damaged many buildings. Built and operated by the European Southern Observatory, the La Silla Observatory has several telescopes and is located 93 miles (150km) northeast of La Serena, on the outskirts of the Chilean Atacama Desert . Formally designated C/2014 Q2, Comet Lovejoy (shown) was discovered by Australian astronomer Terry Lovejoy and made its closest approach to Earth on 7 January. On this day it was just 43.6 million miles (70.2 million km) from Earth, and was captured in amazing images by astronomers all over the world . In a chance encounter, the image also revealed a meteor burning up in the atmosphere. Every day about 100 tons of meteoroids, which are fragments of dust and gravel and sometimes even big rocks, enter Earth’s atmosphere . Just up and to the right of the comet is a very famous star cluster known as the Pleiades, also called Seven Sisters, and designated Messier 45 (M45). At a distance of about 444 light-years, it is the closest star cluster to Earth and can even be seen with the naked eye. The cluster is predominantly made of middle-aged and extremely luminous stars, which formed within the last 100 million years. Astronomers have estimated that within 250 million years the cluster will disperse, due to gravitational interactions with the galactic neighbourhood. Also visible (long-exposure shot on the left) is the famous star cluster known as Pleiades, also known as Seven Sisters, and designated Messier 45 (M45). At a distance of about 444 light-years, it is the closest star cluster to Earth and can even be seen with the naked eye. On the right is a color-composite image of the Pleiades from the Digitized Sky Survey . Directly to the right of the comet is a red arc that appears to somewhat resemble the shape of the state of California. For that reason this arc, which is actually the nebula NGC 1499 stretching up to 100 light-years in length, is called the California Nebula. It is an emission nebula, which means that its gases or most likely lit up by high-energy photons emitted from a nearby hot star - in this case an energetic star called xi Persei. It is located about 1,000 light-years from Earth and is usually very difficult to see in the night sky, except with long-exposure photographs like this. In the main image can also be seen a nebula somewhat shaped like the state of California, left, earning it the name the California Nebula. On the right is an infrared image of the nebula from Nasa's Wise (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) telescope . In the top right of the image is a red blur that is even further from Earth, known as IC 405 or the Flaming Star Nebula. It is also an emission nebula, which surrounds a blue star known as AE Aurigae. The nebula itself is about five light-years across, but it is located 1,500 light-years from Earth. Interestingly, the star itself may have once originated near Orion’s Belt, the famous collection of three stars in the constellation of Orion. The star has since been ejected, though, and is now referred to as a runway star. This was possibly caused by the collision of two groups of binary stars two million years ago in the nearby Trapezium cluster, which may have caused a supernova that knocked AE Aurigae into space. In the top right of the image, shown left, is a red blur that is 1,500 light-years from Earth, known as IC 405 or the Flaming Star Nebula. On the right is a separate image of the Flaming Star Nebula showing the 'smoke' of reflection nebula . The other objects of interest in the image include the green glow seen on the horizon in the distance. Known as airglow, this results from oxygen atoms becoming ‘excited' in the atmosphere, which then emit a green light. The atoms extend about 56 to 62 miles (90 to 100km) into the atmosphere. In the distance is the Pan-American Highway, which is a network of roads that measures a huge 30,000 miles (48,000 kilometres) in length. It links all the mainland nations of the Americas, stretching from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska to Ushuaia in Argentina - although the road is not continuous or official in places. And, of course, the image is also dominated by the remarkably La Silla Observatory in the foreground. Built and operated by the European Southern Observatory, the site has several telescopes and is located 93 miles (150km) northeast of La Serena, on the outskirts of the Chilean Atacama Desert. This is one of the driest and remotest areas of the world, meaning the site is free from light pollution and has fantastic views of the cosmos through a clear atmosphere. And, for that reason, even comparatively simple long-exposure images like this are able to unveil many hidden secrets of the universe.

"David Cameron will today tell businesses enjoying their best conditions 'for a long time' that 'it's time Britain had a pay rise'. He will also propose a minimum wage above £8 an hour by the end of the next Parliament. Firms' costs are falling thanks to the strongest economic growth for seven years and the lowest inflation for more than a decade, the Prime Minister will say. His optimistic words echo the famous July 1957 speech by then Tory premier Harold 'Supermac' Macmillan that, at a time of low unemployment and high growth, most Britons 'have never had it so good'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron will today tell businesses enjoying their best conditions 'for a long time' that 'it's time Britain had a pay rise' Mr Cameron, following a week of controversy over Labour's 'anti-business' rhetoric, will suggest the best answer business leaders can give to critics is to boost the pay and conditions of staff. Pay has finally started to outstrip inflation, but firms should go further and 'pass on the good economic news', he is expected to tell captains of industry at the British Chambers of Commerce conference. Tory strategists hope an increasing economic feelgood factor, buoyed by jobs growth and low inflation putting more money in people's pockets, will translate into stronger wage increases by May's general election. Companies are thought to be sitting on £166billion in cash reserves after battening down the hatches through the recession. Profitability is at its highest level since 1998. Mr Cameron will say: 'Now that our long-term economic plan is truly working, together we've got to make sure it works for everyone in our country. Economic success can't just be shown in the GDP figures or on the balance sheets of British businesses, but in people's pay packets and bank accounts and lifestyles. 'The most recent figures show that wages are already growing faster than inflation, and as the economy continues to grow it's important this continues and that everyone benefits. Put simply – it's time Britain had a pay rise.' Mr Cameron will say the recovery overseen by the coalition has been marked by 'astounding job creation', and add: 'To make sure more of those workers feel the effects of this recovery, this Government has already delivered the first real-terms increase in the minimum wage since the crisis. 'I want that to go further – indeed we are on a trajectory to over £8 an hour by 2020. As for business – the conditions have not been this good for a long time. We've got the strongest growth for seven years. We are seeing falling oil prices, meaning businesses up and down the country have lower prices on their inputs. Inflation is at half a per cent. 'Now that your costs are falling and it's cheaper to do business, I'm confident that more businesses will pass on that good economic news to their workers, in rising pay cheques and higher earnings.' His optimistic words echo the famous July 1957 speech by then Tory premier Harold 'Supermac' Macmillan (pictured) that, at a time of low unemployment and high growth, most Britons 'have never had it so good' Labour's business spokesman Chuka Umunna will attempt to draw a line under his party's row with business leaders, telling the conference that 'we will work every day' to make it easier for them to succeed. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will claim Conservative plans for a referendum on EU membership risk damaging business, saying that 'to walk away from Europe – our biggest trading market – would be a disaster for Britain'. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, will say that a reluctance to lend to small businesses remains a 'chronic handicap' to the economy. Funding for small businesses continues to disappoint more than four years after the Mail launched its Make the Banks Lend campaign. London Mayor Boris Johnson yesterday launched a strong attack on Labour leader Ed Miliband and Mr Balls, saying 'everything they say or do seems redolent of a distaste for wealth creation'. The Conservatives have moved three points ahead of Labour, according to the latest weekly survey commissioned by Lord Ashcroft. It puts the Tories up three points in a week on 34 per cent, to Labour's unchanged 31 per cent.","David Cameron will tell businesses that 'it's time Britain had a pay rise'

"Smart car technology is expanding faster than the industry knows how to protect it, leaving gaps for hackers to exploit, a recent survey of major automakers revealed. The report, produced by Senator Ed Markey, found most major auto manufacturers are clueless about how to stop malicious attackers from exploiting expanding technology to steal data or take control of vehicles remotely. 'Drivers have come to rely on these new technologies, but unfortunately the automakers haven’t done their part to protect us from cyber-attacks or privacy invasions,' the senator said in a statement. Warning: Senator Ed Markey released a report that showed most automakers were unable or unwilling to secure computer systems and data in their cars . 'Even as we are more connected than ever in our cars and trucks, our technology systems and data security remain largely unprotected.' Researchers have known about electronic security flaws  for years. For example, one report in 2011 from the University of California and the University of Washington detailed how vehicles' electronic systems could be vulnerable to the many of the same types of intrusions as computers. Yet Markey's report shows the auto industry as a whole still lacks the consistent capability to secure vehicles' systems and protect against even moderately determined attackers. For the report, the senator's office sent letters to 20 major auto manufacturers back in 2013, including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen. The letters asked questions about the known vulnerabilities in vehicle systems, past attempts to hack vehicles, existing security measures and how data was collected and secured. The report claims that among the manufacturers that responded, 11 said that their entire fleet had allowed wireless access to the vehicle and 3 said a majority of their cars did. Attacked: Researchers backed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency found by sending tones to an Impala's OnStar system, it could overwhelm it and inject malware that took control of the car . Behind the wheel: Attackers used access to deactivate the brakes, sending the car into a line of cones . While the entry points make vehicle diagnostics monitoring possible, they also present possible gateways for intruders. When asked by Senator Markey how they secure these entry points, the report says that many manufacturers 'did not seem to understand the questions posed.' The report also found that in the event that your car is taken over by electronic intruders, don't expect the automakers to be much help. Only two manufacturers could describe steps it would take to respond to the attack that could credibly minimize the damage hackers could inflict. The report also found that many automakers collect huge amounts of data - everything from tire pressure to the last place the car was parked. Half of the manufacturers surveyed by the senator's office also stated they collected and wirelessly transmit data from vehicles, though the few that said they secured the data gave 'vague' responses about encryption or passwords. Underscoring Markey's report are vulnerabilities exposed by researchers backed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. With a laptop, computer scientists found they could take control of a car once they had access to systems such as OnStar. 60 Minutes showed attackers gaining access to a Chevrolet Impala, activating the horn and wipers before deactivating the braking system and forcing the driver to crash into a set of cones. Markey's report notes that as more wireless access, including vehicle-to-vehicle communication, emerges, manufacturers will need to respond. 'As vehicles continue to become more integrated with wireless technology, there are more avenues through which a hacker could introduce malicious code,' the report states. 'And more avenues through which a driver’s basic right to privacy could be compromised.' 'These threats demonstrate the need for robust vehicle security policies to ensure the safety and privacy of our nation’s drivers.'","Senator Ed Markey  released a report Monday showing the auto industry lacks the capability to secure car systems and protect collected data .

"Euro judges yesterday deprived convicts and their no-win, no-fee lawyers of a seven-figure payout in the long-running saga over prisoner votes. A serial killer, paedophiles and child murderers were among 1,015 inmates claiming compensation – estimated at £1,000 each – for being denied the vote in general elections. At the same time, they and their human rights lawyers were seeking thousands in legal costs, and even submitted a claim to be reimbursed for the stamps and envelopes they used to submit their case, legal papers showed. The European Court of Human Rights confirmed earlier rulings, dating back to 2005, that it is unlawful for Britain to have a blanket ban on prisoners voting. But, in a victory for the taxpayer, the judges rejected the claim for costs and a cash settlement. David Cameron has claimed the idea of inmates taking part in elections makes him 'physically ill' and vowed to challenge any ruling giving a right to vote . It is thought that the decision will save the UK £1million in compensation alone – and it will be seen as a conciliatory gesture in Whitehall. Leigh Day, a London firm of solicitors which represented more than 550 of the prisoners, is planning to lodge an appeal. Effectively, the lawyers have been left to pick up the cost of bringing the claims, and could be heavily out of pocket. The claimants include David Mulcahy, the ‘Railway Rapist’, who was jailed for a minimum of 30 years for three murders and seven rapes in the 1980s, and Peter Chester, 60, serving life for raping and strangling his seven-year-old niece in 1977. The lead applicant was James Stevens McHugh, 88, a sex offender. The court’s ruling has kicked a decision on how to sanction Britain over the voting ban into the long grass until after the election in May. Serial killer: David Mulcahy. the ‘Railway Rapist’, who was jailed for a minimum of 30 years for three murders and seven rapes in the 1980s . Following Conservative threats to leave the controversial court’s jurisdiction, a string of verdicts have gone Britain’s way – such as last week’s judgment that it is acceptable to hand whole-life sentences to the worst killers. David Cameron, with the backing of a majority of MPs, has said that the prospect of giving prisoners the vote makes him feel physically ‘sick’. Yesterday Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, said: ‘This issue exactly demonstrates why the Conservatives have pledged in a majority government to make changes to the human rights framework in the UK. 'I believe our Parliament should have the final say over matters like this.’ A senior Government source said: ‘The truth is Strasbourg knows the Conservatives are serious when they say they want a fundamental shift in power, so that decision-making happens in this country and not over there. ‘Which makes the idea of a Labour majority at the general election in a few months all the more frightening. ‘We’d be straight back to square one, with the court wanting to flex its muscles, and without any prospect of reform to the human rights framework.’ Conservative backbenchers said the verdict showed what could be achieved if Britain stood up to European institutions. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The European Court made clear it can’t force Britain to change its democratically elected law. ‘That exposes as nonsense the claim that protecting our democratic rights would cost the taxpayer a fortune or lead to us being kicked out of the Council of Europe. Ironically, Strasbourg has boosted the case for Conservative reform of our human rights laws.’ The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled the ban breached inmates' rights, but ruled out awarding compensation . Glyn Gaskarth, of think-tank Policy Exchange, said: ‘This verdict, made by an unelected court which has no democratic legitimacy, is wrong and dangerous.’ Sean Humber, of law firm Leigh Day, said it would be seeking a review of the decision not to award compensation. ‘We seem to be in the sad position where the Government is taking an almost perverse pleasure in ignoring successive court judgments,’ he said. ‘It should be worrying to all of us that the Government appears to have so little regard for its international human rights obligations.’","Legal challenge by 1,015 people jailed during elections between 2009-11 .

"Shopping for clothing has always been something of a hit-and-miss affair for men. Finding the perfect attire usually requires patience, luck and several frustrating hours behind a changing room curtain. But the process could soon become a lot simpler thanks to a German firm fitting photo booth-like body scanners in train stations and even airports. The machine is fitted with a 3D scanner that works by taking thousands of detailed body measurements before customers can order clothes. The device can be used to produce everything from underwear through to shoes completely made-to-measure. Scroll down for video . Outfittery has been fitting photo booth-like body scanners in train stations and even airports for men . The scanner project by the firm 'Outfittery,' based in the German capital Berlin, came about after it was revealed that many men do not even really know what size of clothing they are and as a result are put off ordering online. 'We want to create a stress free shopping experience for men, and their partners, and it has proved incredibly popular, said Julia Bosch, who founded Outfittery, with Anna Alex and Tobias Nendel. The 3D scan takes thousands of body measurements in a matter of minutes which can be used to create clothing . The 3D image, which is created inside the booth (pictured right), of the customers body is then used to created made-to-measure clothing . The machine will also give men clothing suggestions based on their measurements . People only need to say what items they like the look of, and we will deliver them made-to-measure.' The company says its returns for items that do not fit are almost non-existent, making the service more efficient and wastes less time for customers and company. Company spokesperson Alex Keil explained: 'So often men don't know their exact sizes but this new scanner measures them exactly and that means we can choose clothes that we know will fit our clients. 'Our clothes experts know what will fit if they have proper data, and this scanner produces 100 percent pure data - it cannot lie.' 'We are planning on making 20 such scanners and placing them in train stations and airports in the countries in which we operate. 'When thinking about where to place them we thought 'Where does an entire population pass through in a year?' and we realised these transport hubs were perfect'.' The company is currently operating in eight European countries, and looking to expand next to Scandinavia and later this year into the UK.

"He made history as the first Indian chef to receive a Michelin star for his first London restaurant Tamarind in 2001 - and  he did the same again in 2007 for his second venture, Benares. Atul Kochhar, who is widely regarded as one of the best chefs in the country, grew up in a foodie family in Jamshedpur, India, alongside his six siblings. Now, the 44-year-old has written his fourth cookbook, Benares, named after his Mayfair restaurant, which aims to share his unique approach to fine dining. Chef Atul Kochhar (pictured) is widely regarded as one of the best chefs in the UK. He has recently written his fourth cookbook, Benares, named after his restaurant in Mayfair . The restaurant serves modern-Indian British-inspired dishes such as chicken tikka pie with wild berry chutney, Punjabi style seabass and chips served with cumin tempered peas and spiced tomato sauce, and scrambled duck egg served with Cornish mackerel. The chef and restaurateur spoke to FEMAIL about growing up in India, his philosophy of cuisine, and his tips for cooking Indian food at home. In India, you grew up in a foodie family. Did you automatically want to become a chef? No, I wanted to be a cricketer but that didn't happen unfortunately. Growing up in a household where there were six of us - five sisters and a younger brother - food was always around us. India produces around 2,000 varieties of mangoes, and going through different mangoes through the seasons was a heck of a thing. My family was very into it; my dad was very passionate about mangoes. He would make us taste them and that was a great learning. High end Indian dining: Grilled scallops, smoked peppers and tomato chutney, served at at Benares . What did you want to achieve when you moved to Britain? When I arrived, I saw Indian food really in the dark ages. The way it was seen here, it was just curry. But I landed in the right place at the right time. The UK was about to become the melting pot of cuisines. There were chefs like Marco Pierre White, Gordon Ramsey,  Nico Ladenis and many more who were  changing the cuisine in this country and I kind of became part of the movement. As Benares is the subject of your new cookbook, what contributions do you feel the restaurant has made to the British food scene? We have adapted and adopted - the culture, the cuisine, the ingredients - and brought two diverse cultures closer. We see ourselves as a British Indian restaurant and we're very proud of it. Interesting flavours: Tandoori chicken with pickled carrots and ginger, served at Benares . We've seen an influx of food trends in Britain in the past decade. Has that affected they way you cook now? To me, it's inspirational. There are ingredients that are not from my cuisine, but I'm motivated to bring that into my food. Something like chia seeds, which is a hotly debated topic at the moment. It's a super food and we use chia seed in making a drink in India. But I created a dessert out of it. So, you come back into main play again and you're on trend. What are your tips for cooking Indian style cuisine? The simpler, the better. And get to know spices and start cooking with them. Always use spices as if you're using salt and pepper. If you go beyond that, perhaps you'll shock your system and you won't go back. Mangsho Kukni (lamb rump and chick peas) This is a very traditional recipe of meat curry but instead of using diced meat, I have used lamb rump. This only changes the appearance of the preparation, not the flavour profile. Serves four . Preparation time: 20 minutes . Cooking time: 30 minutes . Ingredients for the chickpeas:  150g chickpeas, soaked in water overnight; one bay leaf; one black cardamom; one clove; one teaspoon salt . For the lamb rump: 100ml vegetable or mustard oil; six cloves; two bay leaves; three black cardamom; 200g onions, sliced; 15g ginger-garlic paste; one teaspoon coriander powder; one teaspoon red chilli powder; one teaspoon cumin powder; one teaspoon salt; 200 grams tomatoes, chopped; four lamb leg steaks(100 grams X 4); two tablespoons coriander leaves, chopped; half a teaspoon Bengali garam masala. To finish: Two tablespoons mixed spices (coriander seeds, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, black pepper); one tablespoon Dijon mustard; mixed cress for garnish. Method . 1. Soak chickpeas in water and salt overnight. Drain the water and start with fresh water and spices and boil the chickpeas until cooked. Set aside until required. 2. In a separate pan heat oil and saute cloves, bay leaf and black cardamom. Add sliced onions and saute until translucent, add ginger-garlic paste and cook well. Add dried powdered spices, tomatoes and lamb steaks and add enough water to cover the mixture, cook until lamb is tender. 3. Add chickpeas and simmer until lamb is three-quarters cooked. Separate the rump from the chickpeas. Brush the rump with Dijon mustard paste and roll it over crackled-pounded spices. Roast in medium hot oven for five to six minutes and remove. Place chickpeas and sit rump on top garnished with mixed cress. Serve hot with some rice or bread.","Atul Kochhar  received coveted Michelin star for  restaurant Tamarind .

"Are you someone who posts a status or photo on Facebook, then checks the site every minute to see how many likes and comments you have? If so, chances are you're insecure in your relationships  - and you require attention from others to feel better. That's according to a study that found people who had a fear of rejection typically spent more time 'feedback seeking' on the social network. A study by Union College in New York found anxious and insecure people spend more time 'feedback seeking' on Facebook (stock image shown). They are more likely to post statuses and check for likes and comments. This is done in the hope of getting attention due to a fear of rejection . The study was carried out by researchers at Union College in Schenectady, New York and published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences. It suggests that people who are generally insecure in their relationships are more actively engaged on the social media site - frequently posting on walls, commenting, updating their status or 'liking' something - in the hope of getting attention. Selfies and self-indulgent Facebook statuses suggest we are more narcissistic than ever. But researchers have found we actually started to become increasingly self-centred more than 100 years ago. By studying unique baby names, birth and divorce rates and the use of words like 'I' and 'me' in books, the experts said individualism began rising at the turn of the 20th century. And this rise is blamed on a shift from manual labour to office jobs as people became wealthier and better educated. Individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole. It is said to have first developed among Baby Boomers, born after WWII. The study covered a 150-year period and was carried out by researchers from the Department of Psychology at the University of Waterloo and Arizona State University. In two surveys of almost 600 people aged 18 to 83, the researchers at Union College asked participants about their tendencies in close relationships, and their Facebook habits. The results suggest there are at least two kinds of active Facebook users. These are people who are higher in attachment anxiety, and people who are higher in extraversion. People who were higher in attachment anxiety worry that other people don't love them as much as they want to be loved, according to the researchers, and are chronically concerned about rejection and abandonment. They reported greater amounts of what the study refers to as 'feedback seeking' on Facebook. Because these people need a lot of reassurance they are loved, and are very sensitive to other people's opinions about them, they turn to Facebook for feedback. 'Compared to more secure people, those higher in attachment anxiety are more feedback sensitive,' said Dr Joshua Hart, associate professor of psychology and the lead author of the study. 'They report feeling much better about themselves when they get a lot of comments, likes and other feedback on their posts and worse about themselves when their Facebook activity generates little attention.' Do you find yourself checking the site every few minutes? In the study, anxious and insecure people reported feeling much better when others commented or liked on their Facebook activity. 'Compared to more secure people, those higher in attachment anxiety are more feedback sensitive,' said lead author Dr Joshua Hart . Anxiously attached individuals' level of feedback sensitivity correlates with how active they are on Facebook, Dr Hart said, 'and it appears that this strategy may work: they report receiving more attention than people lower in attachment anxiety.' Dr Hart's co-authors were Dr George Bizer, professor of psychology at Union, and former students Elizabeth Nailling and Caitlyn Collins. Previous research on the relation between personality and styles of engagement with social media is limited and has generated mixed results. The current study is one of the first to examine the reasons people turn to Facebook and the kind of engagement they exhibit as a function of their personality style. 'These studies are consistent with many people's intuitions that some individuals use Facebook to fulfill emotional and relationship needs that are unmet in the ""real"" world,' Dr Hart said. 'There is a robust debate playing out in psychological science and pop culture as to whether Facebook represents a healthy or unhealthy outlet for such needs. 'I think the jury's still out on that, but this research suggests that personality is an important factor to consider when investigating the causes and consequences of people's engagement with social media.'","Study found anxious and insecure people spend more time 'feedback seeking' on Facebook .

"Dinosaurs living around 100 million years ago may have experienced acid trips after eating grass infected by a fungus similar to the species used to create LSD. Palaeobiologists have discovered the earliest specimen of grass ever found trapped inside a piece of amber dug from a mine in the mountains of northern Myanmar. When they examined the grass, however, they found the tips were infected with a fungus that is thought to be similar to Ergot, a group of fungi that grow on rye and wheat. The tip of this grass spiklet, encased in amber 100 million years ago, is covered by a fungus similar to ergot . Compounds produced by ergot fungi, or Claviceps, can be hallucinogenic and were used by scientists to synthesis the powerful drug LSD that became popular in the 1960s. Researchers who identified the fungus say that giant herbivorous dinosaurs living at the time would probably have eaten large amounts of this fungus. Opium, magic mushrooms and other psychoactive drugs have been used by humans for thousands of years. An anthropologist has discovered that humans have been cultivating and using mood-altering substances since the Stone Age. Professor Elisa Guerra-Doce has compiled evidence from around the world that Neolithic people were taking drugs derived from cacti in 8,600BC and that they were cultivating opium poppies by around 6000BC. Researchers have also found reddish stains on 13,000 year old human teeth found in a burial pit in Duyong Cave on Palawan Island in the southern Philippines, which are thought to be caused by chewing the leaves of the betel plant. It is still chewed through out much of Asia as a mild stimulant. Charred cannabis seeds have also been found in bowls that date from the Bronze age Pit-Grave culture that appeared in Romania around 2000BC. Dr George Poinar, palaeobiologist at Oregon State University who helped conduct the research, said: 'There's no doubt in my mind that it would have been eaten by sauropod dinosaurs, although we can't know what exact effect it had on them. 'There is a good possibility that some of the chemical compounds found in the fossil were hallucinogenic. 'It seems like ergot has been involved with animals and humans almost forever, and now we know that this fungus dates back to the earliest evolution of grasses. 'This is an important discovery that helps us understand the timeline of grass development, which now forms the basis of the human food supply in such crops as corn, rice or wheat. 'But it also shows that this parasitic fungus may have been around almost as long as the grasses themselves, as both a toxin and natural hallucinogen.' According to the analysis, which is published in the journal Palaeodiversity, the fossilised grass grew between 97-110 million years ago. At this time - the middle of the Cretaceous period - the land was dominated by large dinosaurs and conifers. However, it is around this time that the earliest flowering plants, grasses and small mammals were beginning to evolve. Trapped inside the amber - which is formed from fossilised tree resin - is the spikelet from the tip of one of these early grasses. Ergot now infects crops like rye (seen on the left) but scientists found a similar fungus on the fossil of a grass that grew 100 million years ago (right), suggesting the hallucinogenic fungi evolved with the early grasses . The ergot fungi Claviceps purpurea, pictured above, produces compounds that have been used to make a range of medicines but was also used by scientists to synthesis the powerful hallucinogenic drug LSD . Dr Poinar and his colleagues from the USDA Agricultural Research Service and Germany found growing on the spikelet was also a now extinct fungus. Named Palaeoclaviceps parasiticus, it is similar tothe Claviceps fungus that infects grass crops like rye and wheat around the world. Claviceps contain compounds called ergotamine, which can be converted into lysergic acid, which can be hallucinogenic. Some species of ergot also contain large amounts of lysergic acid itself. Scientists used ergotamine and lysergic acid to synthesis lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD. The researchers speculate that Palaeoclaviceps and its relation Calivceps may actually have been helpful to grasses by helping them to repel herbivores. The fungus is extremely bitter and can cause delirium, convulsions and severe pain. LSD, pictured as a powder above, is a powerful psychedelic drug that was first sythesised from lysergic acid obtained from the ergot fungus but the hallucinogen was declared illegal in the UK in 1966 and the US in 1971 . In cattle is causes a disease called Paspalum staggers while in the middle ages it is known to have killed thousands of people who ate infected rye bread. More than 1,000 compounds have been extracted or derived from the fungus, with many of them becoming valuable drugs. Ergotamine, for example, is a vasodilator and has been used in the past to control bleeding after childbirth and induce abortions. Writing in the journal the researchers said: 'Few fungi have had a greater historical impact on society than ergot.' A flesh-eating plant that grew in Russia about 40 million years ago is thought to be one of the earliest examples of predatory plants to be found. The fossil was discovered perfectly preserved in amber, showing its leaves that are strewn with multi-cellular stalked glands and single cell hairs. The new species was dug out of a mine near Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea and is believed to be related to the 'flypaper trap' plant Roridula, found in the southwestern Cape of South Africa. Roridula catches small prey - largely insects - with its leaves that are covered in an extremely sticky glue produced by the glands or tentacles. Like Roridula, the Russian plant's leaves show evidence of different sized tentacles with which it would have captured prey and smothered it in slime before releasing digestive enzymes. The tentacles, as well as the glands on the leaf surface, absorb the nutrients from the prey.","Palaeobiologists say the fossil is the earliest specimen of grass ever found .

"The families of two babies given to the wrong mothers by an ‘alcoholic’ nurse two decades ago have been awarded almost £1.5million in damages. The newborn girls were placed in the same incubator at a French clinic just before the blunder. A paternity test uncovered the truth ten years ago, but the girls have stayed with their non- biological parents. A court in the southern town of Grasse today ordered the clinic in Cannes to pay the compensation to the two families including to Mrs Serrano and her daughter Manon, pictured . One of the mothers, Sophie Serrano, said: ‘I don’t see my biological daughter any more. 'The social, educational and cultural differences between the two families added to the pain of our unconscious rivalry, took their toll on our relations.’ In a joint civil action, the families had demanded £10million from the maternity clinic, the doctors who supervised the two births, and the auxiliary nurse. But a court in Grasse, southern France, yesterday awarded the smaller sum, with £300,000 to be given to each of the girls. Three of the parents will get £220,000 each, while the girls’ three siblings will each receive £50,000. The clinic in Cannes had admitted fault but blamed the accidental swap on a trainee nurse, who it said suffered from alcoholism. Yesterday a clinic spokesman noted the ‘significant difference’ between the amount requested and the sum won. One of the lawyers for the families said they would not be appealing, and added that they were ‘relieved that the court had recognised the clinic was responsible’. The mistake came about after Mrs Serrano gave birth on July 4, 1994, to a daughter, whom she called Manon. The baby was suffering from jaundice, so a day later she was placed in an incubator next to another girl, named Melanie, who also had jaundice. Mrs Serrano discovered that Manon was not her biological daughter despite the fact she had raised doubts with hospital staff . The condition causes the skin to become yellow, and the girls were treated using light from special lamps in the incubator. However, when they were returned to the wrong mothers, Mrs Serrano said her daughter’s skin seemed to be much darker than before. Staff at the clinic dismissed her concerns, telling her that the difference was due to the incubator lamps. The girls were taken home by the unwitting parents and grew up 20 miles apart. But Manon Serrano, now 20, said that as a child she was frequently teased in her village near Cannes about being the ‘postman’s daughter’ because she did not resemble her father. He finally took a paternity test when Manon was ten. It then emerged that not only was he not the biological father but Mrs Serrano was not her biological mother. Further inquiries revealed the clinic mix-up. The two families met but are now estranged. The second family was also at court yesterday but has chosen to remain anonymous throughout the legal proceedings. Manon Serrano has previously said: ‘They [the clinic] took my innocence away. They took away my dreams, my hopes, my desire to have children.’ Both sets of parents had originally pressed criminal charges against the clinic. But because the swap had taken place more than a decade earlier, the case was dismissed under the statue of limitations. Sophie Serrano, pictured shortly after giving birth at the age of 18, discovered her daughter had been accidentally switched at birth ten years after the event .

"A Premier Inn security guard has been sacked after he reported a 'legless' guest to police for drink driving and breached confidentiality policy - by telling another customer. George McDonald, 52, spotted the drunk man getting into his car and driving away from the Chorley North branch in Whittle-Le-Woods, Lancashire, and called the police. Moments later he crashed into a bollard just metres from the hotel's entrance and was arrested for drink-driving, driving without third party insurance and without a licence. George McDonald (pictured) has been sacked for gross misconduct after he reported a drunk driver to police and told a hotel guest about it the next day. He is appealing his dismissal saying he 'did nothing wrong' He is now appealing his dismissal for gross misconduct after he told someone about the incident the next morning and a complaint was made. The grandfather-of-three said the man had been leaving the hotel premises at around midnight on January 22. 'He said he'd left his laptop and he'd got a meeting at 7am. He said he was with a woman in her room but he didn't know what room she was in,' said Mr McDonald. He added that from what he told him he was able to figure out that it must have been room number 10 that he had left it in. 'I told the man to wait in reception while I went and knocked on the door, but the man was drunk and he followed me. 'I was doing my best to keep the situation calm so I proceeded to knock on the door. When there was no answer I told him that was the best I could do because I was not prepared to get anybody out of bed. 'I told him he would have to come back at 7am. When he left I phoned the police when I saw him getting back into the car.' Mr McDonald added: 'I did not give that man any personal information. I was doing my best to deal with a very difficult customer. The man was leaving the Premier Inn in Chorley, Lancashire (pictured) when he crashed into a bollard and was arrested by police for drink driving, driving without third party insurance and driving without a licence . 'I am employed there as a security guard and get £7 an hour, yet I am expected to be all things. I was acting as receptionist when I was trying to help him out.' The incident came to light after he told a customer what had happened at 6am the following day. The customer's friend, who was staying in number 10, made a complaint after it turned out the man had not been in room 10 - but room 24. Mr McDonald was then hauled into the office and told he was being dismissed for gross misconduct - after the hotel alleged he gave out confidential information about a guest. He claims he is baffled as to what the customer complained about - and why he was dismissed, as he insists he did not give out any confidential information. 'Believe me, this guy was absolutely legless,' he said. 'He was that intoxicated. He crashed his car about 20 yards outside the hotel. The security guard has worked at the hotel for two years and claims he still doesn't understand what the customer complained about . 'I just felt I'd done the right thing by getting a drunk driver off the road - and I'm in the process of losing my job. 'I feel I've done nothing wrong. I love that job with a passion. It is not fair that I have been pulled up over this when I did a commendable thing that night. 'The police who came said I should be aware that I had probably saved at least one life. 'The driver came out of the hotel and hit a lit bollard, meaning he was about to drive into oncoming traffic.' A spokesperson for Premier Inn said: 'Premier Inn can confirm that a member of staff at our Chorley North site has recently been dismissed following customer complaints regarding guest confidentiality, which we take extremely seriously as a business. 'They have subsequently informed us that they are appealing the decision and pending that appeal we cannot make any further comment.' Lancashire Police has confirmed receiving a report of a male who seemed intoxicated and getting into a car at 12.40am on January 22. They said, on arrival a silver Renault Meganne had appeared to have collided with a bollard close to the hotel and the driver was breathalysed and arrested at 1.02am. The 38-year-old, of Chorley, Lancashire, was charged with drink driving, driving without third party insurance and driving a vehicle otherwise than in accordance with a licence. He was bailed and set to appear before Chorley Magistrates' Court on February 5. On Monday, Mr McDonald received a letter from the Criminal Justices System informing him the man appeared at the court on that date and pleaded guilty. He was fined £300 and his licence was endorsed for 23 months. He was also sentenced to a 150-hour community order, ordered to pay £85 costs and a £65 surcharge.","George McDonald, 52, spotted a drunk man get in his car and called police .

"Rachel McIntyre, pictured leaving court,was seen holding the infant by his ankles before dropping him on the floor . A drunk former nurse fractured a baby's skull when she dropped him head-first on to the pavement after picking him up by his ankles, a court heard. Rachel McIntyre, Edgemoor Park, Balloch, near Inverness had taken the four-month-old, who she was looking after last June, with her on a trip to the local shop to buy vodka. Inverness Sheriff Court was told that McIntyre, 38, had taken the baby out in a pushchair when residents in the Kinymlies area of Inverness heard the sound of a distressed baby. Fiscal depute Roderick Urquhart said: 'They looked out of their garden and saw she was holding the baby by his ankles over her left shoulder and had her other hand on the pushchair. 'One of the witnesses turned to his wife and said: 'She is going to drop the wain.' 'They then saw her drop the baby and he fell on to the road surface. It seems that McIntyre phoned an ambulance. 'The witnesses said she was 'out of it.' The infant was rushed to hospital where doctors found he had sustained an 11cm fracture of the left side of its skull. 'The baby spent a few days in hospital,' added Mr Urquhart. 'The child has since made a full recovery.' When interviewed by police, McIntyre denied holding the baby by the ankles and dropping him, claiming the child had fallen out of the pushchair and 'bounced' the court heard. McIntyre later admitted the wilful ill-treatment of the child while under the influence of alcohol on Lawers Way in Inverness on June 16 last year. Defence lawyer Duncan Henderson said it was unlikely his client, who had previously struggled with alcohol, would be able to return to nursing. He said: 'She had been a nurse and was well thought of by her colleagues. The likelihood is that she will no longer be allowed to practice as a result of this offence. McIntyre  admitted the wilful ill-treatment of the child while under the influence of alcohol at Inverness Sheriff Court (pictured) 'She has struggled with alcohol in the past and did very well to get back to practising professionally. 'But in 2014 she suffered a triple whammy. One of her two sons was diagnosed with epilepsy, her father was seriously injured in a road accident and she had a premature baby. 'She found it difficult to cope and turned to alcohol again. When I met her in the cells the following day, her first question was: 'How's the wee boy?' 'She has not been drinking since and has been receiving help and treatment. She is very contrite and knows she was wrong.' McIntyre was spared jail and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. She refused to comment after the case.","Rachel McIntyre of Balloch took the baby to a local shop to buy the vodka .

"Hundreds of foreign nurses hired by the NHS are quitting after a few months in the job, figures show . Hundreds of foreign nurses hired by the NHS are quitting after a few months in the job, figures show. Understaffed hospitals are increasingly having to recruit from Spain, Portugal and Italy because of a severe lack of home-grown nurses. Managers are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds hiring nurses in batches of 20 to 30 at a time at specially-arranged recruitment fairs. But an investigation has found that 943 of the 5,680 nurses recruited over the last two years have since quit. This includes Aintree Hospital, in Liverpool where all of the 14 nurses hired from Spain in 2012/13 left, many returning home. In East Kent 21 out of 26 had departed. Often nurses find it difficult to settle in due to the language barrier, different healthcare system and weather. Leaving close family at home is also an important factor. The figures obtained by the Nursing Times under the Freedom of Information Act also showed that 13 trusts lost at least half of the foreign nurses hired in the last two years. About 20,000 nursing posts are vacant. This is partly a result of the Government slashing the number of nurse training posts by 15 per cent since 2010. That led to fewer coming up from university. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said the figures highlighted how recruiting overseas nurses was only a 'temporary, short-term measure.' 'This money would be far better spent here, training and supporting our own nurses to deliver the high quality care that patients deserve. We hear from patients on our helpline that there are real issues with nurses from other countries, including problems with communication and a lack of understanding of processes and procedures. 'We are concerned that poor English skills may lead to mistakes and misunderstandings when patients are trying to explain their problems.' Aintree Hospital, Liverpool, saw all of the 14 nurses hired from Spain in 2012/13 leave, many returning home . Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'The last couple of years have seen increasingly desperate attempts to plug the gap with more nurses from overseas, who have undoubtedly made a huge contribution and kept the NHS afloat. 'Some of the sums spent on recruiting staff have been ludicrous and the fact that Trusts are not able to keep hold of them is a natural result of years of lackadaisical workforce planning in the NHS.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Since May 2010, we have 21,300 more permanent clinical staff working in the NHS, including 9,500 more doctors and nearly 8,000 more nurses on our wards. 'We've also invested in leadership training to create a new generation of senior nurses, and we're running a campaign to get experienced nurses who've left the profession back to work – with over 1,300 signed up.'","Understaffed hospitals are recruiting from Spain, Portugal and Italy .

"The two men charged with plotting an 'imminent' terror attack on Sydney involving large knives lived together in a white granny flat, it has been revealed. Mohammad Kiad, 25, and Omar al-Kutobi, 24, shared a home in Fairfield in Sydney's west, where a home-made flag, representing the prescribed terrorist organisation Islamic State, was found. A Sydney police station and officers on the street were revealed to have been the mens' targets, with attacks scheduled for just before midnight on Tuesday, Channel Nine reported. During police raids at the property on Tuesday afternoon a machete, a hunting knife, and a video featuring both the men, with one recorded making threats, was also discovered according to police. It's understood Al-Kutobi is from Iraq and was granted citizenship in 2013. Kiad, a former nurse, is believed to be from Kuwait.

During police raids at the property on Tuesday it's alleged a machete, a hunting knife, and a video featuring one of the men making threats were found . Police will allege the men were plotting to carry out an attack on Tuesday and had armed themselves with a machete and a hunting knife and made a video detailing their plans. An image of the pair smoking shisha together - obtained from 25-year-old Kiad's Facebook page - was uploaded in July, 2013. According to his Facebook profile, Kiad is from Kuwait and has been married since January 26, 2010. On Kiad's Flikr account, he posted images of the Opera House, luxury cars, waffles and Arabian horses. Neighbour Deresita Heisele-Brown said Omar al-utobi was friendlier than Mohammed Kiad who was 'shy' but both young men had become more withdrawn over the last month. She said the boys rarely cooked - sometimes a barbecue - and ordered in pizza or Chinese and went out to meet friends or go to the mosque. Photos from inside the flat where Mohammad Kiad, 25, and Omar al-Kutobi, 24, lived shows their home in a mess after it was raided by counter-terror police on Tuesday . A neighbour said both men rarely cooked - sometimes a barbecue - and ordered in pizza or Chinese and went out to meet friends or go to the mosque . Kiad has reportedly lived in the flat for a year and al-Kutobi for up to three years . 'They wore western clothes but sometimes head wear and Mohammed wears long white tunic, maybe for the mosque.' She said both men went to Centrelink but were often short of money and couldn't pay rent to the owner of the house, Mr Huynh, who has a large property with a granny flat in which the two men lived, Kiad for a year and al-Kutobi for up to three years. Kiad  worked as a nurse in Kuwait but could not transfer his skills to Australia and about a month ago both men had got jobs as furniture removalists.

A neighbour said both men went to Centrelink but were often short of money and couldn't pay rent to the owner . Moldy Lebanese bread, boxes of energy cereal, an unused sink full of plastic-ware and barbecue trays and utensils were found inside the home. Inside the squat two bedroom granny flat which the two alleged terrorists tented from their Vietnamese landlord, there are scenes which could depict the squalor of any twenty something bachelors. A picnic table sits out the back by the rubbish bins. A song book is propped on the sink near a toolbox on top of the unnused stove. A box of Arabic green tea has been torn open in the kitchen. An Islamic calendar still hangs on the wall in a back room by a pulled out drawer full of wires and leads. Neighbour Deresita Heisele-Brown said Mohammed Kiad was 'shy' but had become more withdrawn lately . A home-made flag, representing the prescribed terrorist organisation Islamic State, was found at the flat, police said . Outside the scenes from a police raid on a granny flat in Sydney's west, in which two men were arrested and charged with one count of 'do act in preparation/planning for terrorism act' Neighbours Teresita Heisele-Brown and Michael David said Omar Al-Kutobi had changed his look after the police anti-terror raids in wesyern Sydney last September which resulted in the arrest of alleged terror plotter Omarjam Azari. 'He began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' Mr David said. 'I heard them praying in there [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic. Ms Jeisele-Brown said the pair had fallen out with another neighbour over the last month or two for 'speaking sharp' and that she had been upset with them after finding a religious picture of hers dumped in the rubbish bin. 'I had been in hospital having chemotherapy and when I came back home my picture of Jesus Christ was missing,' she said. 'I found it in the rubbish. I don't know who dumped it but I thought... I didn't say anything.' Ms Heisele-Brown said Omar Al-Kutobi had been talking about going to Germany where his mother lived and had been waiting for his mother to send him money. 'He had no family here, but he said he could never go back to Iraq.' She said she had noticed that after the Martin Place siege, the two men had had lengthy discussions in Arabic and had watched a lot of television, perhaps coverage of the a siege. She said when the police came around to arrest the pair, Mohammad had pretended he didn't speak English. She said detectives had made the men lie on the ground while they handcuffed them. NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn and Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said two men have been arrested on terrorism charges . Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Michael Allnutt told Magistrate Vivien Swain the matter should be adjourned until Thursday at Central Local Court in Sydney, when the men are expected to apply for bail. 'There is clear security issues, ' he said. The men had been charged with 'a very very serious offence', he added. The defendants, who were housemates at the time of their arrest, have asked for an Arabic interpreter. Authorities arrested the pair in Fairfield, western Sydney, on Tuesday, the same day they were allegedly planning to maim or kill someone in a knife attack. NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn said in a press conference on Wednesday two men, aged 24 and 25, have been charged with 'acts done in preparation, for, or planning terrorist acts'. 'We will be alleging that the two men were well advanced in their preparations,' Ms Burn said. It will be alleged that the two were going to undertake an act of terrorism in Australia as revenge for incidents overseas. Crown prosecutor Michael Allnut leaves Fairfield Local Court in Sydney on Wednesday . A machete, a hunting knife and an IS flag were seized along with other items in two terror related arrests . Searches were conducted at their residence, as well as on a car, and where the men work. 'A machete, a hunting knife, a home-made flag representing IS and also a video which depicted a man talking about carrying out an attack' were seized, Ms Burns said. 'We will allege both of these men were preparing to do this attack yesterday... it was imminent and we acted.' Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Michael Allnutt told Magistrate Vivien Swain he understood the men wanted bail. In September last year, Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed how a senior member of the Islamic State terror group had urged a network in Australia to carry out public beheadings. The latest plot is not thought to be  related to a previous plan last year to behead someone in Martin Place, in Sydney's city centre. Neither of the men were on NSW Police's radar until a member of the public tipped them off. 'The type of act is consistent with the messaging coming out of IS but we are of the view that there is no further imminent attacks planned,' Ms Burns said as she tried to reassure the public. AFP Deputy Commissioner, Michael Phelan, said the raids and arrests were an example of how authorities are having to be 'nimble to adjust to the threat'. 'We acted as soon as we possibly could,' he said. NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn revealed details of the alleged terror plot which police foiled on Tuesday . Ms Burns continued: 'We don't know the exact nature of the target, who was intended, however we do need to be vigilante whether it is police, military or the general community. 'Everyone needs to remain alert.' The raids, titled Operation 'CASTRUM', were led by NSW Police Force's Joint Counter Terrorism Team. The men, aged 24 and 25 years old, were arrested yesterday at a house in Riverview Road at Fairfield, just after 4pm on Tuesday. Deputy Commissioner Burn strongly urged members of the public to continue to provide information when and where they see anything suspicious. More to come . The raids were a joint operation between NSW Police and the Australian Federal Police . The two men were allegedly planning to maim or kill someone in a knife attack (stock police photo shown) In Parliament, Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that authorities had thwarted what would have been its third 'brush with terrorism' following the Melbourne incident in which two officers were stabbed in September and the Martin Place Lindt café siege in December. 'Police found a large ISIL or Daesh flag, a machete, a hunting knife and a video of a recording of one suspect kneeling in front of the ISIL flag with the two knives while making a statement in Arabic,' Mr Abbott said. 'This was an imminent attack in Australia inspired by the ISIL or Daesh death cult.'","Two men were arrested in western Sydney on Tuesday .

"A driver who flipped over his car and ejected his girlfriend onto the road faces manslaughter and negligent homicide charges. Kieran Duffy, 26, lost control of his Chevrolet pickup truck, which entered the center median on a highway outside of Fairbanks, Alaska, and began to rollover multiple times. The car, which was heading south around 12.30am early Saturday morning, rolled over to the northbound lanes and threw Amber Rae Evans, 26, who was believed not to be wearing a seat belt. Amber Rae Evans, 26, died after being thrown from a pickup truck while riding with her boyfriend Kieran Duffy on an Alaska highway . She was declared dead at the scene. Duffy told police that he had been drinking before the incident, which occurred near the town of North Pole, according to the Fairbanks News Miner. He 'showed multiple signs of being under the influence' according to state troopers' log of the event. The driver, who was wearing a seat belt, received only minor injuries. He is being held without bail. Friends paid tribute to Ms Evans on social media, changing their pictures to those with the deceased young woman.

"The 'bride-to-be' of a British jihadi told him he 'looked beautiful' when he sent pictures of himself stood with ten-year-olds  brandishing AK47 machine guns in Syria, a court heard today. Hana Khan, 23, also reacted with glee when she saw her fiance posing in front of the black Islamic State flag in Aleppo, it is alleged. Khan is said to have sent her boyfriend, who cannot be named, £1,000 to fund his involvement in the fighting, the Old Bailey was told. The jihadi was also bought a pair of combat trousers by his friend Anton Atkins, 31, who spent £1,600 on him, jurors heard. On trial: Hana Khan, 23, and Anton Atkins, 31, are accused of funding terrorism and helping a British jihadi fighting in Syria with cash and gifts . Both Khan and Atkins are accused of funding terrorism at the Old Bailey, which they deny. Prosecutor Chris Hehir said: ‘The prosecution say that his reason for going to Syria was to join the ranks of rebel forces fighting the regime of President Assad. ‘His motivation in doing so was primarily a religious one. He had converted to Islam, and indeed changed his name, some time before leaving the United Kingdom. He went to Syria to fight alongside those sharing his religious outlook. ‘Both defendants are or were friends although Anton Atkins and Hana Khan did not know each other prior to the events with which this trial is concerned. They were both involved in providing and seeking to provide money and, in the case of Anton Atkins, seeking to provide an item of clothing, for his use in Syria. ‘The prosecution case is that both defendants knew very well why he had gone to Syria. They knew that he had gone there to fight: in other words to use or threaten serious violence in furtherance of a cause. They knew - or at the very least should have suspected- that anything they gave him materially might be used in furtherance of fighting, by him or others.’ The jihadi left the UK in July 2012 and crossed into Syria in June 2013 after passing through Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey. Allegations: Miss Khan is said to have said her fiance looked 'beautiful' in a photo of him posing with children holding guns . On June 2 2013 he sent Hana Khan three photographs of himself posing with small children under ten years old in Syria, near Aleppo. Mr Hehir said: ‘They are profoundly disturbing images because a deadly weapon is being put in the hands of young children who smile as if it is a good thing to hold an AK-47 or similar weapon. ‘He clearly has very little respect for the innocence of children.’ Hana Khan responded with the message: ‘You look beautiful’, the court heard. Mr Hehir added: ‘The prosecution suggest there is nothing beautiful about what he is doing in these photographs and the fact that Hana Khan viewed them as beautiful says quite a lot about her outlook. She was pleased to receive them.’ The jihadi also sent a photo of himself posing with a gun in front of a black Islamic flag to Atkins, the court heard. By 20 June 2013 he was asking Atkins for money using the WhatsApp messaging service. The jihadi said: ‘Get the loogah*As much as you can anyway* Beneficial*U know this*.’ Two days later the jihadi messaged Atkins about another woman he was planning to marry: ‘if all goes to plan*She is due to come in 3-4 weeks*So ur have to link her around them times if u can*But a soon as she books her ticket il let you know’. In another message he referred to Jabhat al-Nusra, an extremist group affiliated to Al Qaeda. The Old Bailey also heard how Atkins organised a shopping spree at Westfield in London to buy the combat trousers for his jihadi friend. Atkins allegedly organised the excursion to the shopping centre in Stratford, east London alongside Mohammed Chowdury, who was also friends with the jihadi and acted as a 'go-between', the court heard. Denial: Both Khan and Atkins, pictured at a previous hearing, are accused of funding terrorism at the Old Bailey but have pleaded not guilty . Mr Hehir told jurors: 'On 3rd July 2013 Mr Chowdury messages Anton Atkins to say that they needed to meet the following day and go to Westfield shopping centre. 'When Atkins asked why, Chowdury replied ""Grab tings for my man. Just some combats"". 'And that is a reference to combat trousers, and you may think knowing what we do about his friend, it's blindingly obvious why his man might want and need a pair of combat trousers.' In the end, Atkins could not make the shopping trip, the court was told. But on July 4 telephone records show the jihadi had moved from Syria into Turkey in order to pick up money and supplies, it was claimed. The same day, Chowdury allegedly messaged Atkins saying 'I'm going to go with another brother today to grab them thing... and then link you tomorrow... because the brother I'm going with today need to go their [sic] anyway so I will just go with him rather than burdening you habibi.' The word habibi translates from Arabic as 'baby' or 'my darling'. The court heard how Atkins then picked up the trousers the following day to pass on to an unnamed individual planning to 'link' with the jihadi. By July 8 the jihadi had crossed the border into Turkey, where he could collect any money wired to him and pick up supplies, it is claimed. That morning it is alleged Atkins messaged the jihadi, saying: 'Am I droppin' both to the bro leavin' tmrw today? Bats n p.' The prosecution said p referred to money. The jihadi replied that Atkins should 'Speak to Asif,' Chowdury's middle name, adding: 'He knows wagwan,' meaning what is happening. Mr Hehir said: 'The prosecution cannot say definitely who the combat trousers ended up reaching. 'But it is clear that Anton Atkins was heavily involved, in that they should be supplied to the jihadi he had been in conversation with.' Atkins, of Woolwich, southeast London, denies four charges of funding terrorism involving combat trousers and a total of £1,600. Khan, of Willesden, northwest London, denies two charges of funding terrorism involving a total of £1,000. The trial continues.

"A woman whose mother abducted her as an infant and took her overseas more than 20 years ago stood in a courtroom Tuesday, fighting back tears, and told a judge she has had a good life even though she didn't know her birth father growing up. 'I was raised very fortunately. I was loved beyond belief,' Samantha Geldenhuys, 21, told U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel after her mother, Dorothy Lee Barnett, pleaded guilty to parental kidnapping and two counts of falsifying passport applications. The judge sentenced the 54-year-old Barnett — who lived in Isle of Palms when she took her daughter 10-month-old daughter in 1994 — to 21 months in prison followed by two years' supervised parole. She is expected to be released in a few months because she gets credit for time served since her arrest in November 2013. Scroll down for video . Prison: Dorothy Lee Barnett, charged with kidnapping her infant daughter from South Carolina and fleeing overseas more than 20 years ago, was sentenced to 21 months in a U.S. prison . Dorothy Lee Barnett (left) was found by Australian and US police in November 2013 living on the Sunshine Coast with her daughter Savanna Todd (right), after allegedly abducting her 20 years ago. She denied the charges after being extradited to Charleston, South Carolina, but eventually plead guilty . 'I was loved - I had no idea': During an Australian TV interview last year, Savanna Todd - Samantha Geldenhuys - explained how she only found out about her kidnapping when her mom was arrested . That's after she was tracked down in Australia, where she had been living under another name since 2007. It was the first time her daughter learned about her past. 'It was a shock to me, and this is the last place I expected to be standing,' Geldenhuys said. 'It could have been great to grow up here.' She said she recently spent time with her birth father, Benjamin Harris Todd III. He had legal custody after her parents divorced. 'That was an experience I cannot describe in words,' she said. According to court records, Todd and Barnett went through an acrimonious divorce in February 1994. The family court found that 'the mother steadfastly rejected that the father had a role of value to the child and that she and the child would be better off if he were not in the picture at all,' records said. Prosecutors said that a few months later, Barnett left for a birthday party during a visit with her daughter, then called Savanna Catherine Todd and nearly a year old, and didn't return. Barnett was eventually located in Australia and fought extradition but was returned to the U.S. om September. Barnett told authorities that she fled to Malaysia and then South Africa, where she met and married Juan Geldenhuys, who is now dead. She said the family later lived in Botswana, New Zealand, and Australia, moving for her husband's employment. Barnett did not have custody of Savanna when she took her from her American father to attend a birthday party and failed to return in 1994 . She told authorities that over 20 years, the only person she had contact with in the United States was her brother, who has since died. Before sentencing, Barnett told the court that she had separated from Todd while pregnant with her daughter. She thanked God for all the friends who have been taking care of her daughter and her son since her arrest. 'Ms. Barnett, there are no winners in this situation,' the judge told her. Geldenhuys didn't comment as she was hurried from the courthouse into a car. Benjamin Todd didn't appear at the hearing. The attorney who represented him in his divorce, Graham Sturgis, spoke to the judge on his behalf. He read a note Todd wrote after his daughter disappeared, imagining himself looking down the driveway: 'Someday my daughter will be looking there for me.' Sturgis said his client 'feels that justice has been served and is focusing on getting to know his daughter.' Barnett's attorney, Russell Mace III, said he didn't know whether Geldenhuys would remain in the United States or return to Australia. He also said Barnett's sentence was an expected one. He said that Barnett could be free 'in 11 or 12 weeks and perhaps sooner.' The charges of falsifying passport applications each carried a maximum sentence of 10 years; parental kidnapping, a maximum of three. But in federal court, judges get a range of sentences based on a report that considers matters such as the nature of the crime and previous convictions. Barnett had none. The report suggested 15 to 21 months. The judge said he sentenced Barnett to the maximum in the range because 'this was a calculated, methodical crime carried out in a deliberate way.' Gergel said: 'I don't believe Ms. Barnett is going to commit any other crime. But it is important that others be deterred from taking the law into their own hands.' Barnett (pictured left in the 90s and right in an artist impression) was located and arrested in Queensland in November 2013 after she disappeared with her 10-month-old baby from South Carolina in 1994 . Court papers say Samantha's father was the one who lead authorities to find his ex-wife. An Australian friend of Mr Geldenhuys, Barnett's second husband, had grown suspicious of her. He heard Barnett call her daughter Savanna and she had previously spoken about escaping an abusive relationship. A simple internet search provided old photos of Barnett as wanted in relation to the disappearance of Savanna, and the Australian man was able to contact. When she was arrested, Barnett initially agreed to be extradited but she later backed down. Her lawyers asked the government to prevent the extradition, but Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan ruled this week she had to be surrendered. 'The Minister arrived at his determination following careful consideration of the provisions of Australia's extradition law and taking into account representations made by, and on behalf of, Ms Barnett,' a government spokesman said. Savanna (pictured left as a baby and right now) was by her mother's side during a court appearance last year when she was denied bail. She held a sign saying: 'We love you Mum' Supporting her mother: The 21-year-old said she had a normal, loving upbringing and never held a grudge against her mom for not knowing the real story of her upbringing . The attorney for Mr Todd, Graham Sturgis, told the judge his client never gave up searching the world for his daughter. Mr Todd wanted Barnett to receive maximum sentencing for what she put him through. 'He recognizes the need (for Samantha) to love her mother,' Sturgis said. 'Very few of us will ever know the experience of having lost a child. 'No punishment will ever make good the loss that Mr. Todd has suffered.'","Dorothy Lee Barnett, 54, was found and arrested in Queensland in 2013 .

"RMT general secretary Mick Cash confirmed members had voted for industrial action but said the union remained open for talks . Tube drivers have voted to go on strike after one of their colleagues was sacked for allegedly being drunk on the job. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union voted for the industrial action by 299 votes to 221 after the Northern Line driver lost his job. London Underground, which has a 'zero tolerance' policy on drugs and alcohol, had urged union members to vote against strikes, insisting they dismissed the driver for failing two random breath alcohol tests. But union bosses claimed the tests were 'unfair' as they didn't take medical conditions into account which could affect the result. General secretary Mick Cash said: 'Our members have voted for industrial action and the union will now consult extensively with our representatives before deciding on our next moves in this dispute. 'The union remains available for talks, at Acas if necessary, and as we have already stated we are ready to abide by any decision made at an Employment Tribunal and cannot understand London Underground's reluctance to agree to that course of action.' London Underground operations director Nigel Holness said the decision was a matter of safety and urged those who voted for strike action to 'see sense.' 'We operate a zero tolerance approach towards the consumption of alcohol in order to keep customers and staff safe,' he added. 'You wouldn't let someone who had been drinking alcohol drive your family in a car, and we don't let people who have been drinking alcohol drive people's families in Tube trains. 'As we have made clear, strike threats will not alter our commitment to safety, nor will they make us consider reinstating a driver who failed two alcohol breath tests. 'RMT members have sent a clear message to their leadership that they don't support indefensible strike action on this issue. 'Less than a quarter of those eligible to vote for strike action did so. 'I urge the RMT leadership to see sense and recognise that there is simply no point in taking any further action.' RMT regional organiser John Leach said he rejected a number of allegations by  Mr Holness, in a letter sent out to union members. He said: 'RMT fully supports the zero-tolerance policy and takes seriously our obligations to protect the safety of passengers and staff. If they go ahead, the tube strikes could cause chaos for commuters trying to get to work in London . 'We are actually asking for further testing when a hand held breathalyser gives a positive result. 'This makes the process more robust and also complies with the Equalities Act in protecting members of staff with medical conditions. 'The current system is unfair because it doesn't offer safeguards to those with disabilities or who are on certain diets. 'One of LU's own doctors conceded that type 2 diabetes, liver disease and even fasting can give false positives on hand held machines.'","The tube driver was sacked after failing two random breathalyser tests .

"Conrad Truman smiles in court on Monday before he was sentenced to life in prison for his wife's murder . A husband sentenced to life in prison for his wife's murder refused to apologize to her family in court on Monday as he insisted that he didn't kill her. Conrad Mark Truman, 32, was given 15 years to life in prison for the murder of 25-year-old Heidy Truman and up to 15 years for obstruction of justice, to run consecutively. He refused to apologize during the court hearing in Provo, Utah, claiming that he was not responsible and that his wife committed suicide. 'I did not kill my wife… I can't say sorry for something I did not do. 'I won't say sorry. It's not my fault that she shot herself,' Truman said, according to sltrib.com, during a rambling half-hour speech. The 32-year-old said he would never give up fighting his murder conviction as it was a 'big injustice', adding that the evidence was circumstantial. Mrs Truman's family were in court to watch her husband sentenced but the victim's mother, Janet Wagner, opted to leave the room while the killer made his statement. His attorney Ron Yengich said in court that his client plans to appeal. Heidy Truman was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head at the couple's Orem, Utah home on September 30, 2012. Truman had claimed that his wife either committed suicide or was gunned down by a stranger  outside the home. During his trial, police officers testified that Truman's bizarre behavior following his wife's shooting raised suspicion. Heidy Truman, 25, was killed by a gunshot wound to the head at her Utah home in September 2012. Her husband was sentenced to life in prison for her murder on Monday . Defense attorney Ron Yengich comforts Conrad Truman during his sentencing where he was ordered to spend life in prison for his wife's murder . Truman had reported his wife's death during an emotional 911 call. 'There's so much blood. If they don't get here right now, she's gonna die,' he wailed in the call, which was played at his preliminary hearing in 2013. 'I don't know what happened. I really don't know what happened, I swear to God. She was in the shower, she came out of the shower and I heard a pop, and there's blood, and she's in blood. Later, he shouted on the call: 'If you don't get here quick, my wife's life is on your head. My wife.' After officers arrived, they found the home in disarray, blood spatter throughout and Mrs Truman naked in the bathroom with a single bullet wound to her head. An investigation found she had been shot at close-range. A police officer also testified during the trial last year that when officers responded to the home after the 911 call, they found Mr Truman kissing her feet and saying he was sorry . Officer Art Lopez told the court last October that Truman was threatening to kill the officers if they didn't save his wife. Officers added that Truman had allowed the couple's dogs to walk through evidence and he went to the bathroom without a police officer, the court heard. Prosecutors said that Truman killed his wife so he could collect her $878,000 life-insurance policy. Before the shooting, Truman and his wife of three years had been watching TV show Dexter and drinking whiskey. Truman's defense team argued that the reason he gave confused accounts of what had happened was because he was drunk and had just found his wife shot dead. However after giving conflicting accounts, officers later tried to question Truman - but he failed to return their phone calls and refused to speak to them at his workplace. Following an investigation into the death, he was eventually arrested during a traffic stop in July 2013, nearly a year after his wife died. Mrs Truman was found with a gunshot wound at close range at the couple's home in Orem, Utah in September 2012 after the couple had been drinking and watching TV .","Conrad Mark Truman, 32, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Heidy Truman, 25, in Provo, Utah on Monday .

"She's the star of Made In Chelsea's fitness DVD and regularly flaunts her enviable physique on Instagram, so what's Lucy Watson's secret? The star, 23, who has developed a penchant for exercise, has enlisted the help of a personal trainer to keep her looking trim. FEMAIL caught up with  the fitness aficionado and the man behind her new physique to find out the workout that keeps her in shape. Scroll down for video . Made In Chelsea star Lucy Watson has developed a penchant for working out and has been showcasing her toned new figure out and about lately. FEMAIL caught up with the star and her trainer to find out how . Speaking about how she developed a passion for health and fitness, Lucy, 23, said: 'I'm motivated by people around me and I just got to a point in my life where I needed a change.' Trainer and nutritionist, Ashton Turner, who owns  Enhance Nutrition LDN in London and trains Lucy, said: 'Lucy and I met when we worked together on the Made in Chelsea fitness DVD. 'Lucy was one of the cast members who took part in my workout. After the DVD, she wanted to continue with her training and I asked to work with her.' Discussing Lucy's physique and fitness before they met, Ashton said: 'Lucy has always had a naturally lean body, which is thanks to her being active growing up and taking part in gymnastics and dance. 'She also leads a fairly healthy lifestyle and pays attention to what she eats. Her fitness levels weren’t terrible but they also weren’t where they could have been, which is probably due to her filming schedule but we all have periods where work or life take a front seat and exercise a back one.' Lucy, who cites her role model as 'amazing' Jessica Alba, said she found working out 'boring' and 'difficult' at first because she had such a busy schedule that she found it  hard to get into a routine. Lucy's typical workout  incorporates a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes . Lucy showcased the fruits of her labour in a black bikini on a recent holiday to Australia . She said: 'My days are always different and I could never get properly into it. I think it's just wanting those improvements with your body and health in general that motivated me.' Lucy says she likes exercise 'where you don't even realise you're exercising', like tennis or horse riding. But, she says, thanks to Ashton, who is always changing it up and is fun to be around, she never gets bored any more. 'I don't want to emulate anyone else's body,' she admits. 'I just want mine to be toned and lean. I don't want to lose any weight or curves, just tone up what I already have. I also want to increase my strength.' Lucy is already making great headway and showcased the fruits of her labour on a recent holiday to Australia. Ashton believes that, like Lucy, more and more women are embracing weight training, which he thinks is, in part, due to some 'fantastic and beautiful athletic role models out there' Lucy has been showing off her toned legs and new fashion sense in recent style snaps . Trainer and nutritionist, Ashton Turner, pictured, left, before he embarked on a gruelling fitness regime and, right, now, met Lucy when he was training her for Made In Chelsea's fitness DVD . So how can we emulate her taut stomach? Ashton said: 'Lucy has a great flat tummy but isn’t looking for washboard abs. In our sessions, we concentrate on a mixture of core exercises like planks and side planks as these help to pull in your waist. 'We then add lower ab exercises such as reverse crunches as lower abs are often overlooked. On top of this, we add rotational movements such as seated twists. This ensures Lucy has both a flat stomach and a strong core for the bigger exercises such as squats and deadlifts.' He added: 'Lucy also ensures her diet is clean, luckily there wasn’t much we needed to change but its true what they say, abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen.' Ashton and Lucy's typical workout  will incorporate a big lift such as a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes. Lucy has also been following a healthy diet, which she posts on her Instagram page, to complement her fitness regime. As her trainer says, abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen . The duo then follow this up with mini circuits concentrating on working the body in single leg movements such as walking lunges and upper body push and pull exercises like press-ups. 'Every session is a full body session to keep her body balanced and injury-free and we often throw in HIIT (high intensity interval training) finishers to add in a cardio element,' he said. Ashton believes that, like Lucy, more and more women are embracing weight training, which he thinks is, in part, due to some 'fantastic and beautiful athletic role models out there'. He added: 'Everyone trains for different reasons. There are strong people, there are skinny people, but what is important is that people are allowed to feel comfortable in their bodies. Having people like Lucy show young females that you can enjoy life, eat well, train and reap the rewards is great.' Lucy recently launched her new style site but it crashed from an overwhelming demand - she hopes to get it back up and running as soon as possible .","Lucy, 23, has recently developed a passion for fitness and healthy eating .

"Five year-old's injured from competing in baby cow rodeos, cars colliding with emus and cowboys suffering chaffed thighs from chaps is all part of a typical day inside one of the most isolated emergency rooms on earth. A new documentary reveals the young and dedicated staff who choose to live in the outback to care for the colourful characters that wander through the doors of Broken Hill Base Hospital Emergency Department in the outback mining town hundreds of kilometres from the nearest capital city. The resilient personalities, who are tough enough to call this harsh town home, which is located in far western NSW and 1,000km from Sydney, are used to limited access of medical resources that's comes with living in the middle of nowhere. Scroll down for video . Broken Hill Base Hospital Emergency Department is in the outback mining town in far western Sydney . Dr Katy Ellenberger was a junior doctor in the emergency department for almost six months and learnt to embrace the solitude of living in a dusty town of just 18,000 people . Emergency services director, Dr Andrew Olesnicky, has been working in the emergency department for an impressive four years and there is only one other permanent staff member . Dr Katy Ellenberger was a junior doctor in the emergency department for almost six months and found the remote post an invaluable experience both professionally and personally. 'It takes some getting used to. It makes all of your normal relationships long distance relationships, which can be challenging,' she said. 'But you become closer to the people in the town as a result. It leads to a strong sense of community and mateship. The born and bred city slicker, from Sydney's northern suburbs, learnt to embrace the solitude of living in a dusty town of just 18,000 people. 'In a way it's actually really lovely to be isolated, you realise how little you need to be happy and fulfilled,' 'It also didn't hurt that my internet shopping addiction could continue without a problem!' The 27-year-old vows she is a better doctor thanks to her time in Broken Hill. 'Normally I would have layers of senior doctors above me in the hierarchy, but in Broken Hill there are fewer doctors, so you are moved up the ladder in terms of decision making and responsibility,' she said. 'It gives you the chance to really challenge yourself, and the chance to directly help people.' Many patients travel from hundreds of kilometres to receive emergency medical assistance in Broken Hill . Dr Leigh Golding says: 'working in Broken Hill can be a bit nervewracking… you can get some emergency situations that you would deal with in a different way if you had all the resources of a big hospital' Five year-old's injured from competing in baby cow rodeos, cars colliding with emus and cowboys suffering chaffed thighs from chaps is all part of a typical day inside one of the most isolated emergency rooms on earth . After working at the hospital for only six months, Dr Katy is considered a long-term employee because it is hard to keep staff on for longer than a few weeks at at time. Emergency services director, Dr Andrew Olesnicky, has been working in the emergency department for an impressive four years and there is only one other permanent staff member. 'We can find people to fill holes in our roster but to get people to relocate out here for any period of time and consider themselves local is really difficult,' he said. 'There's a real value to having someone here for more than a few weeks.' But the 37-year-old has long been considered a local of the rural town and he has seen it all. One 'archetypal bush type patient' that first comes to his mind is a five-year-old girl who had broken her leg after being bucked off a calf while competing in a rodeo . 'I don't know how hard they buck but I imagine they would be pretty cute to watch - she was dressed up in her cowgirl gear and it was cute as hell,' Dr Andrew said. Dr Sandy Clarke says: 'emergency can be an adrenaline rush, it’s volatile, it’s unpredictable and that can be quite a buzz' Dr Andrew (in the hat) and Dr Katy (in yellow) with other staff members at the town’s biggest event of the year - the Broken Hill races . Dr Andrew (left) will never forget the 'old codger' who has blue skin from taking silver supplements . However, the orthopedic surgeon the little girl was about to be sent in Adelaide did not find the incident quite so endearing. 'He obviously didn't get the culture and said that was child abuse and insisted that I report the mother to children's services before he would accept care of this kid - which I didn't do because that's just ridiculous,' Dr Andrew said. 'You are dealing with the bridge between the bush outback culture and the - in inverted commas -civilised gentrified types in the big fishing village that is Adelaide.' Dr Katy also experienced emergencies that would not be considered run-of-the-mill incidents on an emergency floor in the heart of the city. 'Normally in the city motor vehicle accidents involve two cars, and maybe a bike or motorcycle for variety, she said. 'In Broken Hill you get car versus emu, motorcycle versus kangaroo, and grey nomad caravan versus anything.' The Royal Flying Doctors is a fundamental service for the hospital's emergency department . Peter Ballard Nurse unit manager says 'no two days are the same in the emergency department' With Broken Hill hospital located more than 500km from the nearest city - Adelaide - the paramedics really have their work cut out for them . She went on to explain that the patients are some of most reasonable people she had met because they're used to having limited resources and therefore accepting of the restricted care provided. 'I had a gentleman, with a previous history of chest pain, who came in with crushing chest pain for the last two days,' she said. 'But instead of calling an ambulance he got on his motorcycle, drove 200km, and walked in the front door. 'It was reckless, but in a way I had to admire his stoicism.' This example perfectly depicts the calibre of the locals in and around Broken Hill. 'Overall they are grounded, self deprecating and tough, with an excellent sense of humour and a very colourful, creative vocabulary,' she said. Dr Andrew isn't moving to the big Smoke anytime soon: 'the people are lovely and the beer is cold.' Dr Phillip Vitols, the only other permanent staff member, lived in Sydney before moving to Broken Hill over two and a half years ago: 'you don’t know what is going to come in and there is such a variety of presentation' Another intriguing character to present himself in emergency was a 'real salt of the earth old codger' who had an interesting blue tinge to skin but had turned up for unrelated reasons. 'He was taking silver supplements for general health - that's how he had been self medicating for years - he figured or had read that it keeps the doctor away,' Dr Andrew said. 'We looked it up because no one had heard much about it - there wasn't a lot of evidence for it but I don't think it's particularly toxic, so we decided it wasn't a big deal.' Dr Andrew doesn't look like moving to the big Smoke anytime soon. 'Every now and then you get to be a hero and save someone's life and that's a really good feeling,' he said. 'Also the people are so welcoming and inviting - and the beer is cold.' Outback ER premieres on Thursday February 12 at 8pm on ABC.

"Ten steps to climb: Dorothy Bradbury (above) was told she must swap her black sacks for a wheelie bin outside her home in Great Barr, Birmingham . A council was today branded 'shambolic' for using Google Street View to decide which homes should receive new wheelie bins in a controversial £65million scheme. Birmingham City Council said images from the website were ‘useful’ in deciding which properties were suitable for the new-style bins, which are being introduced around the city. But Perry Barr councillor Jon Hunt - a long-term opponent of the scheme - said the revelation was the latest ‘shambles’ to dog the initiative. Great Barr resident Dorothy Bradbury, 79, was told she must swap her black sacks for a wheelie bin, despite having to negotiate ten steps to leave her rubbish outside her home. Claiming Google pictures of her home failed to show the steps and the slope on which it stands, she said: ‘I simply can’t drag two wheelie bins up ten steps to my home. ‘It is impossible. I would injure myself and end up in hospital. I am saying “no” to the council - I am not having wheelie bins. They can keep their hands off my sacks.’ Details of her case emerged as letters went out in the areas of Sutton Coldfield, Erdington and Perry Barr, telling households if they were to receive wheelie bins. Liberal Democrat councillor Mr Hunt said he had tried and failed to drag a wheelie bin up Ms Bradbury's steps, adding that many properties in the area were on steep slopes and unsuitable for wheelie bins. Street View: She said Google pictures of her home failed to show the steps and the slope on which it stands . Long walk: Ms Bradbury, 79, has to negotiate ten steps to leave her rubbish outside her home in Great Barr . Mr Hunt said: ‘The council has blown £65million on this project and is pouring out propaganda. Yet it cannot even promise to send officers round to walk the streets and look at properties. ‘When you compared what Google Street View shows with what you see at street level, you can see the crass incompetence of relying on Street View in an area as hilly as Great Barr.’ Residents can appeal against the imposition of a bin but Mr Hunt said that was not obvious on letters they received. ‘This is the all too predictable shambles I have been warning about for two years,’ he said. ‘The council has refused to listen to these warnings and pushed on.’ New policy: Details of the 79-year-old resident's case emerged as letters went out in the areas of Sutton Coldfield, Erdington and Perry Barr, telling households if they were to receive wheelie bins . Suitable: Wheelie bins will be delivered to north Birmingham homes in time for collections to begin in June . Around 95 per cent of Birmingham homes have been rated suitable for wheelie bins. The others, such as blocks of flats, will continue with their current arrangements. Wheelie bins will be delivered to north Birmingham homes in time for collections to begin in June. Assistant director of bins Kevin Mitchell defended the use of Google, saying it was ‘helpful’. He said: ‘I get people with front gardens the size of football pitches saying they haven’t got room for two wheelie bins. I can look at a picture on Google and I don’t need to go round there.’ But Mr Mitchell said that, in marginal cases where residents appealed, officials would take a closer look in person. ‘We will go round and make an assessment,’ he added.","Birmingham councillor says revelation is latest 'shambles' to dog scheme .

"A collection of letters and plans, which chart the construction and design of former US President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie's home in northern Virginia, is set to go under the hammer later this month. The unique 400-piece archive includes ten letters sent by Jackie to the property's architect, detailing her exact thoughts on what the home should look like - and her delight at the finished product. 'You have done the most fantastic job and everyone agrees,' the then-First Lady wrote in one letter, believed to have been sent shortly after construction on Wexford House was completed in 1963, just a few months before JFK's assassination on November 22. Scroll down for video . Family home: Construction on the Kennedys' home in northern Virginia was completed in 1963. Here, the couple is pictured at the property in an archive image from the White House . The finished product: Jackie was determined to make Wexford House the perfect home for her family . Perfection: In her letters to the family's architect, Jackie expressed her thanks for the way in which they completed the house . 'That house is really a dream. One could not wish for anything more perfect - if only we could live in it all year long! And Jack [JFK] loves it - so bravo.' Jackie went on to explain that she had included some images of the property so that the architect could see the finished result, however she added that she would send a further set of photographs in the fall, 'when everything is in place'. She signs of the letter by saying: 'A million thanks - you can always get me on the phone. Love Jackie.' Earlier letters included in the collection also provide a glimpse into Jackie's relationship with her beloved husband JFK - who was known to his nearest and dearest as Jack. 'This house may not be perfectly proportioned - but it has everything,' she wrote in one letter. 'All the places we need to get away from each other. 'It has everything': The then-First Lady joked that the home had all the space that the family needed 'to get away from each other' Interior design dreams: The property was designed and furnished to Jackie's exact specifications . Home is where the heart is: Tragically, the Kennedys were only able to spend three weekends together at the property before JFK was assassinated in November 1963 . 'So husband can have meetings, children watch TV, wife paint or work at desk, nurse [can have] her own room, [the] help a place to sit, all things so [many] bigger houses don't have. I think it's brilliant!' And while the majority of her correspondence was handwritten on lined yellow notepaper, there are also three letters printed on official White House stationary included in the collection, one of which addresses speculation about when the couple actually planned to move into the property. It seems that there was great speculation at the time about whether the Kennedys would make the final move into their new home, with Jackie explaining to her architect that they would not be able to visit the property until mid-October, after she had returned from a planned vacation in Greece. 'I cannot wait to see the place in October!' Jackie wrote. 'We will come there the minute I get back from Greece. 'It isn't true at all that we are planning to rent it for another month; I don't know where that rumor started.' Tranquil: The property was tucked out of the way, far from any prying eyes . Love, Jackie: Some of the letters sent were typed on headed White House stationary . A suggestion: Along with her letters, Jackie also sent magazine clippings, complete with annotations about which aspect of the design she liked the most . The letter was dated September 30, 1963, meaning it was sent less than two months before Jackie's husband was assassinated while on a political trip in Dallas, Texas. According to reports, the couple were only able to spend three weekends at their new Virginia-based property before he died. In addition to her letters, the collection also includes a number of magazine clippings, complete with annotations and notes, which Jackie sent along with her correspondence. On each cutting she pointed out a design element which she felt would suit their own home - and, perhaps surprisingly, indicated her ongoing desire to keep the budget as small as possible. For example, on one picture of what appears to be a living room layout, she wrote: 'This kind of long window [would be] nice for [the] master bedrooms - unless too expensive. 'It makes a good balance opposite a window-door.' A second cutting even includes a small drawing, indicating how Jackie wanted the sink in her bathroom to look. Tight budget: Jackie indicated through her notes that she was mindful about keeping the costs of building the property to a minimum . Personal touch: Jackie even included a few of her own drawings in order to illustrate her ideas . The ideal escape: It seems as though the home was intended as a kind of oasis for the Kennedys . 'For my bath - this this kind of sink arrangement. One sink, but space underneath for [a] stool so it can double as a dressing table. Doesn't have to be this fancy marble and woodwork etc.' This unique collection of plans and correspondence is due to go under the hammer at the Boston-based RR Auction House on February 19, alongside an assortment of other Kennedy memorabilia, including a selection of photos of JFK and Jackie enjoying a relaxed vacation in Cape Cod with their close friends and family. The candid images were taken by Washington Post heiress Katharine Graham at Listerine heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon's Cape Cod beach shack in August 1961, just two years before JFK's assassination. In the images, both Jackie and JFK can be seen relaxing in the company of their holiday companions, including Mrs Mellon and her banker husband Paul, JFK's closest sister Eunice, artist William Walton, Katherine Graham's husband Philip, and three of the Grahams' four children. In one series of photos, JFK can be seen eating a relaxed meal outside on the deck, while deep in conversation with his host Mrs Mellon. His wife is pictured just a few meters away, seated alongside Mr Mellon. Intricate detail: The auction lot also includes the final design plans for the property . Every aspect: The plans and designs detail all the different areas of the home . Architectural genius: Jackie was incredibly happy with the final result and added that 'Jack loves it too' Another set of images shows the then-44-year-old former President enjoying a swim in the bay alongside a male companion, before climbing up out of the water and onto what appears to be a dock, while reaching for a towel. According to Pamela Keogh, author of Jackie Style, the images offer an incredibly rare glimpse into the private lives of the Kennedys. 'They're amazing pictures,' she told People. 'These were the masters of the universe in their downtime, sitting on beach chairs, smoking and eating clam chowder. '[JFK] is not in perfect shape and Jackie's wearing a bathing suit your mother might have worn. 'This is not Jackie in French couture. They don't even look like they know they were being photographed.' Rare glimpse: Alongside the Wexford House collection, RR Auction House will also be taking bids for a selection of images taken of the Kennedys while they were vacationing in Cape Cod . A rare moment of calm: The photographs include this image of JFK on the dock in Cape Cod . RR Auction House's vice president Bobby Livingston added that images show an entirely different side to the Kennedys - showing them at their most relaxed and happy, and offering a rare glimpse into their lives away from any public scrutiny. 'We've sold many White House photos of the family but they are always posed,' Mr Livingston said. 'You rarely see candid photos of the Kennedys like this.' RR Auction House's new collections are just the latest in a long line of memorabilia to go under the hammer. In October last year, a set of 13 wedding negatives from the Kennedys' spectacular wedding ceremony and celebration fetched $34,000 at auction, while in 2013, a Polaroid picture depicting the exact moment in which JFK was shot went under the hammer in Cincinnati. Surprisingly, the image, which was predicted to sell for up to $75,000 failed to attract a buyer, but is believed to have later been sold privately.","The Kennedys' property in northern Virginia, Wexford House, was completed in 1963, shortly before JFK's assassination .

"Jurors in the trial of a mommy blogger accused of poisoning her son to death by injecting him with salt were shown harrowing video Monday in which the boy writhes and screams in pain in a New York hospital bed days before his death. Prosecutors contend Lacey Spears gave a fatal dose of sodium to 5-year-old Garrett in January 2014 at Nyack Hospital after years of blogging about his health struggles. In one clip played by Assistant DA Christine Hatfield, Spears is seen walking Garrett to the bathroom while holding his stomach feeding tube, which prosecutors allege she used to poison him. After they return to the room, the clip shows Garrett keeled over on his bed in pain as Spears fails to tend to him until a nurse appears in the room, according to lahoud.com. Horrific: Lacey Spears wept as a court watched video of what prosecutors allege shows her 5-year-old son Garrett writhing and screaming in pain after she injected him with a fatal dose of salt prior to his January 2014 death . Sad: Spears is seen here with her son Garrett. Video shown in court Monday allegedly shows her taking the boy from his bed to the hospital room bathroom, where prosecutors say she used his stomach feeding tube to inject him with salt . Recorded by an EEG camera used to monitor the boy's movements along with his brain activity, the camera shows Garrett acting normally during his first day in the hospital, where his mother took him complaining he was exhibiting seizures. When she learned her son would be released from the hospital because he was not showing any signs of seizures, she gave him the fatal dose, prosecutors say. Jurors watched video taken January 19, 2014 in which five hospital staffers surround Garrett as he flails around. There is no audio with the video, but prosecutors claim he was screaming in pain. Spears broke down and began to weep as the videos were shown. Two jurors were seen to wipe away tears as well, reports lohud.com. 'It seems to go against nature,' the prosecutor said in her opening statements. 'But Lacey Spears is not like most people.' She said Spears enjoyed the 'attention and sympathy' she received from having a sick child. Defendant Lacey Spears brushes her hair back during the opening statements portion of her murder trial at the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains, New York . Garrett was flown to Maria Fareri Chidren's Hospital in Valhalla, where he died days later. Spears, of Scottsville, Kentucky, had documented Garnett's declining health on social media. She wiped away a tear as the prosecutor spoke. Defense lawyer Stephen Riebling told the jurors there are no eyewitnesses and no direct evidence that the 27-year-old Spears poisoned her son. He added: 'There is no evidence in this case that legitimately answers the question 'Why?''' Lloyd told jurors they would see hospital video showing mother and son twice going into the bathroom and then see Garnett become ill soon afterward both times. He died of high sodium levels that caused swelling of the brain. But the bathroom is out of the range of the camera, and Riebling noted that no one saw Spears feed her son salt. He said, in context, Spears' actions show a caring mother. He implored the jurors to 'set aside emotion.' Spears is accused of killing her 5-year-old son Garnett by feeding him salt through a stomach tube and then calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, prosecutors said. During that time, he is seen writhing and screaming on a hospital video camera . Riebling also appeared to blame the hospital, in the New York suburbs near the Spearses' Chestnut Ridge home, noting it was only there that a high sodium level was detected. The defense lawyer said the prosecution case was 'riddled with reasonable doubt.' The Spearses lived in Chestnut Ridge at the time of Garnett's death. Lacey Spears moved to Kentucky afterward and was living there when she was arrested. Garnett's death ended a short life filled with doctor and hospital visits that his mother tirelessly documented in thousands of postings on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and a blog. Many of the postings will be used in evidence, along with Spears' online research into the dangers of sodium in children and hospital records from New York, Florida and Spears' native Alabama. Also in evidence is a feeding bag prosecutors believe was used to hold the salt — and which they say she tried to hide after Garnett's death. Defense attorneys have insisted that there will be no mention of Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers secretly harm children to win sympathy. Some experts believe that disorder fits Spears' actions. Jurors watched video taken January 19, 2014 in which five hospital staffers surround Garrett as he flails around.

"It was unveiled as Labour’s latest vehicle for attracting women’s votes at the election. But Harriet Harman’s pink minibus immediately came under fire for being ‘patronising’ and ‘sexist’.

Pink: Female Labour MPs will travel the country in a women's-only battle bus painted pink, it was revealed . Miss Harman claimed the bus was ‘something new and something different’, which would encourage women who were ‘disillusioned’ by politics and create a ‘Domesday Book’ of women’s demands for politicians. But it was immediately condemned as a ‘gimmick’. Labour sources said Miss Harman was warned by allies the bus was incredibly patronising towards women but she was ‘utterly defiant’ and insisted it go ahead. Labour sources said Miss Harman was warned by allies the bus was incredibly patronising towards women but she was ‘utterly defiant’ and insisted it go ahead. Meanwhile, Lucy Powell, a senior figure in the party’s election campaign, also risked accusations of sexism when she said Labour wanted to have a conversation with women ‘around the kitchen table’.

Labour launching a pink bus, yes pink bus, to target women.’ New: Harriet Harman claimed the bus was ‘something new and something different’, which would encourage women who were ‘disillusioned’ by politics . Jennie Kreser wrote: ‘Dear Harriet Harman … that pink bus is patronising and insulting and you got it VERY WRONG. Yours sincerely, A Woman.’ The bus was widely dismissed as ‘patronising’, while the hashtag #everydaysexism was used. Mrs Powell risked running into a similar storm as she attempted to contrast Labour’s ‘kitchen table’ campaign with the economy under the Tories which ‘just reaches the boardroom table’. She said: ‘That’s why we’re taking our message out around the country to have that conversation about the kitchen table … around the kitchen table’. Miss Harman presented a picture of the bus at a campaign launch in London yesterday, but the bus itself was not revealed. She said the ‘collective’ that selected the colour ruled out red because it would be like all other Labour buses and they wanted ‘something different’. The senior Labour women in attendance were unable even to agree on what colour the bus was – but refused to accept it was pink. Miss Harman claimed it was ‘magenta’ in colour, then insisted it was the ‘correct colour’ before settling on calling it ‘One Nation Labour’ colour. Gloria de Piero, Labour’s spokesman on women and equalities, said the bus was ‘cerise’. It will tour more than 70 constituencies during the election campaign, carrying women from the shadow cabinet, MPs and councillors as well as trade union officials. Tory MP Caroline Dinenage said: ‘This is clearly just another divisive gimmick that the electorate will see through.’ Miss Harman said: ‘I don’t think it’s at all patronising to recognise that women have got different patterns of their working life.’ In recent years, manufacturers and clothing firms have come under fire for gender-stereotyping by using pink for girls and blue for boys. Campaigners say the ‘pinkification’ of girls is forcing them into a dangerously narrow mindset and teaching them that they should be passive and pretty, valuing beauty over brains. Liberal Democrat MP Jenny Willott said last year in Parliament that the message ‘pink is for girls, blue is for boys’ creates a gender divide that hampers girls’ progress at school.","Labour's deputy leader rejected accusations the party is 'patronising'

"A star of the HBO show 'Silicon Valley' is finding himself on the outs in the real Silicon Valley after he called out the girlfriend Uber's CEO during a tech industry awards show - calling her a 'b****' and making a racial remark. Comedian T.J. Miller was hired as host to add some pointed commentary to the 'Crunchies' - referred to as 'the Oscars of Silicon Valley.' The awards show - which has Silicon Valley elite get dressed up and walk the 'green carpet' - hands out awards like 'fastest-rising startup' and 'founder of the year.' Instead, he spent much of the night on Thursday relentlessly mocking Gabi Holzwarth - a violinist who plays tech industry parties - and her boyfriend, 38-year-old Uber founder Travis Kalanick, according to the Verge. Criticized: Comedian T.J. Miller has been criticized online by a host of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs for repeatedly referring to women in the audience as 'b****' and making a racial remark . Smith's war of words was with Gabi Holzwarth, the 25-year-old girlfriend of Uber founder Travis Kalanick, 38. The couple are pictured here in April 2014 . Holzwarth wrote an essay about how she was abused and called 'little b****' when she was 13 and said Miller's comedy routine brought back fillings from that incident . It started when Holzwarth, 25, shouted a comment at Miller when he made a jab at Shervin Pishevar, the venture capitalist who first funded Uber, whom he called 'Sherv.' 'Is that Sherv? How are you doing, Sherv? Wait did a woman just say that’s me?' Miller replies. 'Hey, look, Asians aren’t supposed to be this entitled in the United States.' He then added: 'And that’s why you guys will never be as loved as Los Angeles. It’s all too precious, you can’t joke about it. She’s yelling that she’s Shervin Pishevar. 'Are you f***ing nuts? That guy has seeded the most successful companies in the tri-state area and I’m talking about California, you bitch.' Holzwarth shoots back: 'Did you just call me a b****?' Holzwarth is seen here with Kalanick at the Crunchies with their dog Yobu, which she brought to the show. Photo courtesy Shaun Tai (@shaun_tai) of Oakland Digital (@ODALC), 2015 . Miller plays a burned out tech startup mentor on the HBO show 'Silicon Valley' Holzwarth plays violin at tech parties and also works for the startup Shyp . Holzwarth was mocked for bringing her dog Yobu to the tech industry awards show . Then, Miller spotted the small dog that Holzwarth had taken to the awards show. She joked that she had used Shyp - the new app that offers to pack and ship anything. Holzwarth also works at Shyp. She also announced to Miller that she is a 'bilateral violinist.' Miller responded: 'Did you press a button? A physical button or a digital button?  What is this b**** from Palo Alto?' At one point he also scolded another member of the audience for taking a photo with flash: 'That’s the perfect time to take flash photography. That shows how tech savvy you are. There’s three buttons you can choose: flash on, flash off, or auto, a.k.a. being kind of a rude b****.' Holzwarth, whose Twitter bio says 'I was born to spread my music to the world,' blasted Miller online for his remarks. She tweeted: '10 yrs ago, I was called a b****...not ok. Yesterday I was called a b****...still not ok. Let's try moving away from that word.' She also wrote an essay about the incident in which she said she was abused and called 'a little b****' when she was 13 and that Miller's routine brought back bad memories of the incident. Following the awards show, Katie Jacobs Stanton, a Twitter vice president, wrote an essay titled, 'My first and last time at the Crunchies.' In it, she blasted Miller's comedy routine, saying the themes were 'hostile' toward women and that she was glad she didn't bring her daughter to the show. Tech Crunch responded by issuing an apology and saying that Miller would not be invited back to be the host next year. According to tech site Re/code, Holzwarth met her boyfriend through Pishevar - who spotted her busking in front of Trader Joe's and invited her to play at one of his conferences. She said she's only played for wealthy clients on their private jets.

"Brian Williams met with NBCUniversal's CEO on Tuesday morning as a question mark hangs over his future as anchor of the network's Nightly News. Williams, 55, visited Steve Burke at his apartment close to Central Park in Manhattan on Tuesday morning, CNN reported. The pair later left the building together. The meeting came amid reports that NBC's top executives cannot agree on whether  Williams should be axed or remain at the network after he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter that was hit by a grenade while in Iraq in 2003. Scroll down for video . NBC execs were reportedly divided over Nightly News anchor Brian Williams' future as names of potential replacements began to emerge on Tuesday. The journalist visited NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke on Tuesday (right) A fact-checking investigation by NBC has been taking place into Williams' reporting with a 'progress report' delivered to top brass at the network on Monday. Veteran investigative reporter Richard Esposito, who is Williams' colleague at NBC, has been heading up the probe which will be completed 'sooner rather than later' but doesn't have an exact timetable, according to CNN. Doubt has been cast on Williams' broader reporting at NBC over the last decade after it emerged that he had lied about his time in Iraq. The decision on Williams' future will be taken by top NBC execs but they reportedly failed to reach a conclusion after a weekend meeting at the home of NBC Universal CEO, Steve Burke. According to the National Review, some execs believe that Williams' career at the network was over because he has lost credibility with viewers. However who exactly will step into Williams' shoes was also causing NBC a headache - his current sub at Nightly News, Lester Holt, does not draw the ratings that make Williams' show number one. The National Review also suggested that execs were planning to put Tom Brokaw back in the anchor chair until Today show host Matt Lauer could transition into the role. However pulling Lauer from Today could see the morning show flounder - when it was already behind ABC's Good Morning America in the ratings. The Drudge Report said on Tuesday that Lauer's co-star, Savannah Guthrie, was also being considered by NBC execs as a replacement for Williams. On the flip side, NBC News president Deborah Turness and her boss, Pat Fili-Krushel, chairwoman of NBC Universal news group, were backing Williams because they 'wanted to save their jobs' and not see Nightly News slide to number two position, National Review.com reported. It was yet another major decision facing Ms Turness, former editor of ITV News in the UK for ten years, who took over at NBC in August 2013. In November she fired hotshot executive Jamie Horowitz, formerly of ESPN, who had been hired to turn around ratings at Today. In a memo to staff, Turness described him as 'not the right fit' and cut him loose after less than three months. The Today Show's Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie have been rumored replacements for Brian Williams at Nightly News should he get the chop . Some critics suggest that Williams, who apologized last week for his false claims about Iraq, should be fired. Others wonder if commerce will win out, since Williams has kept Nightly News at the top of the ratings while much of his news division crumbled around him. How much are the years of good work worth? 'This is one of the toughest calls that I've ever seen,' said Paul Levinson, professor of communications and media studies at Fordham University. 'On the one hand, the public is right to expect nothing but the truth from our reporters and our news anchors.' Williams announced on Saturday he was stepping away from the show for a few days. Williams' sub, Lester Holt, told viewers midway through Monday's broadcast that Williams had taken himself off the air because questions have been raised about how he recalled several stories. Holt did not specify what the stories or questions were. 'He'll be off while this issue is dealt with,' Holt said. Levinson pointed out that this isn't a case of someone deliberately inventing news sources or, in the case of Dan Rather at CBS a decade ago, reporting during a presidential campaign a story casting doubt on President George W. Bush's wartime record that could not be backed up. 'The real difficulty for a news organization, or a reporter, is that once you've made one misstep, it's really hard to earn (trust) back,' said David Westin, former ABC News president. 'You can. But it takes a lot of time.' The incident should remind news organizations that it's more important to report the news than 'brand' their personalities, he said. More than 1,000 comments were posted to NBC's 'Nightly News' Facebook page. The majority supported Williams, with some posters suggesting they wouldn't watch the broadcast until he returned. But some commenters said they wouldn't trust him again. Williams took a pounding in the ratings for his final night on the air on Friday, but it's unclear whether the drop in viewership was related to the controversy. The Nielsen ratings company said ABC's 'World News Tonight' had 8.46 million viewers on Friday, while NBC's 'Nightly News' had just under 8 million. For this television season as a whole, Williams' newscast has led in the ratings by an average of roughly 600,000 viewers each night over ABC. On Thursday, the night after Williams' apology, NBC beat ABC by about 800,000 viewers, Nielsen said. Although NBC leads in the ratings this season as it has for much of the past decade, ABC's broadcast with David Muir does win occasional nights. ABC has beaten NBC on nine nights since the beginning of the TV season in September, six of them Friday nights, which in general is NBC's weakest evening. On the Friday before Williams made his admission, ABC won by 400,000 viewers. Meanwhile, another instance emerged of Williams appearing to embellish a wartime reporting experience. Williams traveled to Israel in July 2006 to cover that country's military campaign against Hezbollah. The anchor reported on MSNBC that he flew in a Black Hawk helicopter with Israeli military officials at a height of 1,500 feet. He said he saw a trail of smoke and dust where Katyusha rockets had landed in the uninhabited Israeli countryside. Then, he said he witnessed two rockets being launched toward Israel some 6 miles from where he was flying, according to the network transcript. In an interview at Fairfield University more than a year later, Williams said Katyusha rockets passed 'just underneath the helicopter I was riding in,' according to a film of the interview, described in The Washington Post on Monday. Williams was even more descriptive in an August 2006 appearance with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show.' 'Here's a view of rockets I have never seen, passing underneath us, 1,500 feet beneath us,' Williams said. 'And we've got the gunner doors on this thing, and I'm saying to the general, some four-star, 'It wouldn't take much for them to adjust the aim and try to do a ring toss right through our open doors, would it?'' Also Monday, the newspaper Stars and Stripes released a transcript of its interview with Williams last week, made before his apology, in which he attempted to explain his story. Williams was asked about a claim by military involved in the 2003 Iraq mission that his helicopter was flying about an hour behind the Chinook helicopter that had been hit by the rocket-propelled grenade. Williams said it was the first he'd heard of that. 'I could not see in front of us, and I thought we were just in one flotilla, for lack of a better word,' he said. Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Investigative reporter Richard Esposito, and Williams' NBC colleague, was fact-checking his work and expected to draw a conclusion soon .

"If you walk down the peaceful shopping street in Canada, you'd never believe this sleepy hardware shop was about to appear in one of the biggest films of the year. Now fans of the hotly-anticipated Fifty Shades of Grey film, which will be in cinemas on Valentine's Day, are expecting to swarm the Ladner Village Hardware Store in Delta, Vancouver - and stock up on bondage material to boot. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, owner James Price said before agreeing to let filming happen in his store, he read the book to make sure there were no ‘sticky’ scenes taking place on his premises. But now he is stocking up on red rope, cable ties and duct tape and has a special display in the window. Scroll down for video: . Ordinary: Ladner Village Hardware Store in Delta, Vancouver, was transformed into Clayton's Hardware for the Fifty Shades of Grey film .

Strong: In the book, Ana is attracted to the dark and mysterious Christian Grey . All tied up: Anastasia Steele, played by Dakota Johnson, in Grey's 'red room' ‘I have an adult daughter, and she told me ‘Dad, this is a really big deal’’, he said. ‘So I read the book, and once I found there was no bad or sticky parts happening in the store, I thought there was no reason to not have them in. ‘As people have heard about the filming they’ve been giving me copies of the book – I had six at one stage’. While James has stopped short of creating a dedicated ‘bondage’ section in the shop, they have placed red rope, cable ties and red duck tape in the window of the store ahead of Valentine’s Day to attract kinky punters. ‘It’s not normal for people to come in for that purpose, but it has happened’, he said. ‘The way they say it is that the item they want is ‘not for its original purpose’, though they don’t tend to say it’s for a bedroom scene. ‘All the equipment you would need for that kind of activity is already in the shop.’ Since filming took place over two weeks in January last year, James said they had already had fans come into the shop to see where the action between Anastasia and Christian took place. ‘I had a lady from Seattle, who was following everything about Fifty Shades’, he added. ‘She was in the store trying to place exactly where it all happened, but I had to say to her the crew brought their own stock and equipment to use during filming.’ Intense: The virginal Anastasia Steele is working at the fictional Clayton's Hardware when the mysterious Christian Grey stops by to pick up some 'toys' The independent shop is just one of the businesses looking to benefit from the film, which was filmed in locations across Canada and North America. Crew and riggers spent two days on set at Ladner Village Hardware Store to transform the small shop into Clayton's Hardware, where student Anastasia Steele - played by Dakota Johnson - works part-time. In a trailer released by Universal the mysterious Christian Grey, played by Irish actor Jamie Dorman, flirts with Ana while buying cable ties, masking tape and rope - which, unbeknownst to her, he is saving for a kinky sex game. Later they embark on a torrid love affair as Grey teaches Ana about the intriguing world of BDSM. The shop is one of several real-life locations used by filmmakers as they transformed EL James best selling novel for the big screen. The Heathman Hotel, named 18 times in James' sexy book, is also a real place - but wasn't used in the filming of the movie. Real: The Heathman Hotel, the setting of many of Ana and Grey's trists, is a real place in Portland, Oregon . That hasn't stopped the owners of the hotel, based in downtown Portland, Oregon, attempting to cash in on its association with the hit series. Its website proudly boasts: 'You've found us. We are that hotel. The infamous haunt of main characters Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. 'If you've read this enchanting love story, you know that the Heathman plays a leading role'. Their bar has created its own drink inspired by the book - the '50 Shades' cocktail with gin, fresh tangerine, pomegranate juice, lemon and fresh thyme - and offers a series of special packages. But filming of other sex scenes in the hotly-anticipated film took place in the swanky Fairmont Hotel in Vancouver. Visitors to the luxury landmark hotel in the heart of the city can stay in the same bedrooms used in the filming - and take advantage of the centre's 'Take The Elevator Home' romantic package.

"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has revealed he is kept informed of US-led coalition strikes against ISIS through 'third parties' such as Iraq. Speaking in a rare interview, the defiant tyrant also denied using barrel bombs against his own people - something human rights groups have accused him of doing throughout the four-year civil war. Assad has always denied claims of such atrocities, including allegations that chemical weapons were used in an attack outside the capital in 2013 that killed up to 1,400 people. But it is the first time he has revealed details of how information about coalition strikes is passed on through the 'back door'. Scroll down for video . Carnage: Syrians inspect a site hit by what activists said were airstrikes by forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad in the Douma district of Damascus as the President insisted his army were not ndiscriminately killing civilians . Destruction: Human rights groups accuse Damascus of using unguided munitions such as barrel bombs in its nearly four-year civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 210,000 people . Innocent victims: A man carries two children  from the rubble in the Douma neighbourhood of Damascus . An injured civilian sits inside a shelter as he waits to receive medical assistance after airstrikes on the capital . 'Sometimes, they convey a message, a general message,' he said in the interview  in Damascus. 'There is no dialogue. There's, let's say, information, but not dialogue. 'There's no direct co-operation,' he added, saying the messages came to Damascus through third parties. 'More than one party, Iraq and other countries. Sometimes they convey messages, general messages. But there's nothing tactical,' he said. His comments came as yet more victims were rushed to hospital after what activists said were airstrikes from forces loyal to Assad in the Douma neighborhood of Damascus yesterday. 'We have bombs, missiles and bullets,' he added, dismissing claims that his forces were using indiscriminate weapons. 'There are no indiscriminate weapons. When you shoot, you aim, and when you shoot, when you aim, you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians. 'I haven't heard of (the) army using barrels, or maybe cooking pots,' he said, laughing, in an interview with the BBC published today. Referring to the alleged 2013 gas attack, he said: 'Who verified who threw that gas on who?' And asked if his government was responsible, he said 'definitely not,' adding that the reported death toll was 'exaggerated.' He also said his forces were 'definitely not' using chlorine as a weapon. Obliterated: Assad denied that the army was using makeshift barrel bombs - crude barrels packed with explosives and shrapnel that are generally dropped by helicopter . More than 210,000 people have been killed since the conflict began with anti-government protests in 2011 . Stunned: An injured civilian sits inside a shelter as he waits to receive medical assistance . Since Syria gave up its chemical arsenal in a Russian- and U.S.-brokered deal after the 2013 attack, there have been persistent reports of the use of chlorine gas. In many of those instances, residents reported hearing helicopters, suggesting the involvement of government forces. Damascus has grudgingly accepted the strikes against ISIS on its territory that began on September 23 last year, but has repeatedly criticised the coalition for failing to coordinate with it. It says the raids cannot defeat ISIS unless the international community starts cooperating with Syrian troops on the ground. Assad said the US-led strikes had the potential to help his government if they were 'more serious.' 'Who threw that gas on who?' President Assad also denied claims that Syria's government had used chemical weapons against its own people in August 2013 in an attack outside the capital that killed up to 1,400 people .

A man places his left ear on rubble as he tries to listen for survivors trapped under the rubble of a building . 'Yes, it will have some benefits, but if it was more serious and more effective and more efficient. It's not that much.' Washington has ruled out co-operating with Assad's government against IS, and the Syrian leader said Damascus had no interest in joining the coalition. 'No, definitely we cannot and we don't have the will and we don't want, for one simple reason - because we cannot be in an alliance with countries which support terrorism.' The comment appeared to be a reference to coalition support for other rebels groups fighting to overthrow him, all of which his government derides as 'terrorists'. Assad said U.S. officials 'easily trample over international law, which is about our sovereignty now, so they don't talk to us, we don't talk to them.'

"You may recognise the name Randi Zuckerberg following her integral marketing role at a little site called Facebook, which was, coincidentally, founded by her brother, Mark. While at the company, she pioneered and ran the social media marketing programs for the brand and introduced Facebook's live-streaming initiatives. Since then, however, the tech-savvy founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media and the Editor-in-Chief of Dot Complicated, has made it her mission to help others unplug from their wired, technology-filled lives. Randi Zuckerberg has made it her mission to help you 'unplug' while on holiday with Celebrity Cruises . Thus, the 'Take Care of Your Selfie' collaboration with Celebrity Cruises' Canyon Ranch SpaClub was born. The year-long programme, which encourages guests to find a tech-life balance while on holiday, kicked off this month with a new line-up of specially designed spa treatments and services on board. With offerings like 'fACEial Time,' which is a facial designed to treat skin care needs relating to staring at a computer and tablet screens, and the 'texticure' manicure complete with softening paraffin wax, the treatments are as witty as they are relaxing. And it's the manicure that's Zuckerberg's favourite, as it forces her to take a break from responding to emails. Along with the luxury liner, Zuckerberg has crafted a menu of tech-specific detox spa treatments . 'It’s so luxurious and immediately moisturises your hands,' she tells MailOnline Travel. 'And because they’re in gloves, you can’t even send a text message while you’re getting it.' Zuckerberg's interest in the precarious tech-life balance, as she calls it, first began when she was researching her book Dot Complicated: Untangled Our Wired Lives. 'I'd been thinking so much about the wonderful opportunities that technology presents in our lives, but I was also talking to a lot psychologists and observing how our behaviours with tech aren't always helping,' she explains. 'We tend to border on addictive and obsessive - in fact, the average person checks their phone 150 times a day. 'Because technology is new and magical, we haven't quite established balance and boundaries.' The entrepreneur and tech guru also shares her tips for maintaining a healthy work-life balance in her own life . The average person checks their phone 150 times per day, so it's important to make an effort to disconnect . But that's not to say Zuckerberg doesn't understand the appeal and that she isn't guilty of over-checking her mobile herself from time to time. 'I'm a working mum with two young children, so I feel like technology is my lifesaver and the whole reason that I can be doing what I'm doing,' she says. 'But being always connected can be a blessing and a curse, especially when you feel like you're always reachable. 'And when you're on holiday, those little devices in your pocket make it so easy. I call it 'snacking.' It's that moment when you have a minute of downtime, but instead of thinking about something creative, it's easy to mindlessly whip out your phone and scroll through feeds.' Zuckerberg's trick is to keep her phone in another room during family time and keep the attention on her kids . So, what's her advice to keep 'snacking' at a minimum - both while on holiday and at home? 'I try to put my phone in a different room at home,' she tells MailOnline Travel. 'When you're with your family, it's about quality time. Make eye contact and put the phone away.' But most of all, Zuckerberg wants people to understand that it's simply not possible to do every single thing on your to-do list every single day. So, instead, pick a few things to focus on and - especially when you're on holiday - be sure to take time to relax and fit in the odd spa treatment. 'I have a mantra,' she says. 'It's five words that I repeat: work, sleep, friends, family, fitness.' 'Pick three. You can't pick five because it's impossible to do all five well everyday. 'As long as it balances out in the long run, you should feel happy and proud.'","CEO and author, Randi Zuckerberg, encourages everyone to 'unplug'

"A stone with unusual carvings that was sold as a garden ornament could contain a hidden message. Plucked from a garden in Leicester, the stone was purchased by an archaeologist who believes the intricate pattern was probably carved in Anglo Saxon times, over 1,000 years ago. James Balme, who is also a television presenter, said that the pattern ‘may be some form of writing,’ although there are so far no suggestions about what the 'text' or shapes may mean. Scroll down for video . The intricately carved stone block (pictured) was discovered in a garden in Leicester and was purchased by an archaeologist who believes the carving dates from Anglo Saxon times, over 1,000 years ago.t could even be a form of writing and hide a message. It is believed that the sandstone block was discovered several years ago and someone thought it would make an interesting decorative feature in the garden. Mr Balme found the stone while he was looking for interesting stone carvings to buy on an auction website. 'I came across the carved stone block that was up for sale as an ""unusual garden ornament,"" he told MailOnline. 'As I immediately recognised just how important it could prove to be I just had to purchase it to save it from ending up in another garden or even thrown away at worst. 'At the time it was dirty, covered in moss and a lot of the carved pattern was not clearly visible. 'When I finally received the stone I was shocked as it seemed far more important than I had first thought - and after gentle cleaning the true extent of the carving became clear. It weighs around 60lbs (27kg) and is wider at the base than at the top. The ‘ornament’ caught Mr Balme’s eye because of its unusual shape and upon closer inspection, he noticed the carving. He told LiveScience: ‘It's possible the ‘pattern carved may be some form of writing’. The relief work does not resemble any known text, however, but the shape and style of the rock is typical of Anglo-Saxon monumental art. He told MailOnline: 'Regarding the carvings on the stone my initial feeling is that these are symbols rather than straightforward text. 'There is a great deal of further research to be done in the coming weeks and months.' Mr Balme suggested that the stone could be ‘a keystone from an archway or indeed a vaulted ceiling.’ He also tweeted that the stone could be the base of a cross or a tombstone. The hand-carved rock is 18 inches (46cm) tall and 5.5 inches (14cm) thick. The ‘ornament’ caught Mr Balme’s eye because of its unusual shape and upon closer inspection, he noticed the carving (pictured). It could be part of an archway or be the an archway or indeed a vaulted ceiling . James Balme (pictured on the right with Tony Robinson) said that the pattern ‘may be some form of writing,’ although there are so far no suggestions of what the ‘text’ may mean . In 2009, a garden ornament that had been sitting on a patio for 20 years turned out to be a 3,000-year-old ancient Egyptian jar. The 13inch-high vessel was made during the time of the pharaohs to hold the organs of the dead ready for the afterlife. With a distinctive top in the style of a face and easily recognisable headdress, the Canopic funerary jar had blended into its surroundings in an English garden for two decades. The terracotta jar with the top shaped with the face of the god Imseti was built to hold a human liver. The goddess Isis would have protected it. Dating from the New Kingdom - 1550-1069 BC - the brown-coloured jar would once have been a painted receptacle fit for a pyramid. The owner of the jar, from Dorset, explained: 'It came from an uncle who was a bit of a collector and when he died about 20 years ago it came to us. 'We didn't know what it was and we have kept it on the patio and in the shed over the years. 'It was just used as a decorative piece, a lump of stone. 'Then I looked at it and saw it had a face and it looked a bit Egyptian so we took it in to be valued and was told it was from ancient Egypt. 'It was a great surprise that something that had been sitting there for some time unrecognised turned out to be so old.' The unusual stone is only decorated on one side, although there are chisel marks on other faces. Mr Balme believes the stone dates to the Anglo-Saxon period, which stretched between 410 and 1066AD. The period is known for its intricate patterns, which appeared on buildings and jewellery, for example, as well as written literature such as the poem Beowulf. However, the date is only a guess and he has asked his Twitter followers for help in learning more about the mysterious stone. He Tweeted: 'Any help welcomed in identifying this carved stone recently recovered, is is Saxon or earlier ???' Restoring the block to its original state has been a labour of love and Mr Balme has gently removed paint applied to the stone. He said: '[It’s] one of my best finds ever'. On his YouTube page, he added that the stone could  'prove to be of major importance in the story of Saxon Britain.' But he is not the only person to stumble on an interesting archaeological find in a garden.

"The body of a public schoolboy was discovered in his mother's 'jungle' of a back garden more than two months after he disappeared, an inquest heard today. Miller Redpath, 17, was last seen after what was described as a 'difference of opinion' with his mother Anastasia Miller at their home in Wenhaston, near Halesworth, Suffolk. He vanished on August 13, 2013, two days before he was due to receive his A Level results from £21,105-a-year Langley School in Loddon, Norfolk, where he was a weekly boarder. The body of public schoolboy Miller Redpath (left) was discovered more than two months after he disappeared, an inquest heard today. Right, his mother Anastasia Miller at the inquest today . The inquest in Lowestoft was told that his decomposed body was discovered in dense undergrowth in the garden of his mother's detached Victorian home on October 24. In a statement given to the hearing, accountant Mrs Miller, who runs a real estate agency in Eastern Europe, described her back garden as 'a jungle full of dense plants, attracting butterflies and bees'. She said she had made a thorough search of the garden  four days after her son disappeared, but found nothing. Police also found no sign of Miller when they first searched the ivy-covered house on October 15, 2013, uncovering only a 'trick or treat' mask he had bought for Halloween. However, his body was found during a second search by officers nine days later. The inquest was told that Miller was identified from DNA tests, but a post mortem failed to establish how he died. Suffolk Coroner Dr Peter Dean recorded an open conclusion after hearing how police believed that nobody else was involved in Miller's death and there were no suspicious circumstances. Dr Dean told the inquest that entymology tests on insects at the spot where Miller was found showed that his body may have been there 'for much if not all of the time he had been missing'. At the time of Miller's disappearance, his widowed mother told police that items had gone missing from her home, leading to speculation that he had taken them and was too ashamed to get back in touch with her. Miller's decomposed body was discovered in dense undergrowth in the garden of his mother Anastasia Miller's detached Victorian home (pictured) on October 24 . In a statement given to the inquest into Miller's death, accountant Mrs Miller, who runs a real estate agency in Eastern Europe, described her back garden as 'a jungle full of dense plants, attracting butterflies and bees' But no reference to the missing items was made during the inquest which heard only documentary evidence. After her son vanished, Mrs Miller revealed  she last saw him alive early on August 13 when she left him 'grumpy' in bed. The pair had been due to go to a Christian open air service together, but Mrs Miller ended up attending alone. In her statement, she had described him as 'intelligent, enthusiastic, gregarious, confident and very popular' and an excellent sportsman who was keen on polo, martial arts and rugby and was 'physically and mentally strong'. Miller was also a keen member of the Combined Cadet Force at his school, reflecting his family's strong military background, said Dr Dean. The inquest heard that Miller also had a sensitive side and enjoyed opera and musical theatre and helping others in difficulty. He was also a chorister at school. Dr Dean said Miller and his mother regularly had conversations about politics and other subjects. But he added: 'As with anyone there were sometimes some difficult times, particularly as he was a strong willed young man. 'The early loss of his own father had an effect on him and there were conflicts in respect of things like smoking. 'There were some conflicts about him not being allowed to smoke at home and these conversations could clearly lead to differences of opinion between mother and son. 'We hear of a difference of opinion shortly before these very sad sequence of events took place.' Dr Dean said that Mrs Miller and had a 'lovely day' together on August 12, the day before he disappeared. He added that Mrs Miller was not overly concerned when he failed to come home by the evening of August 14 as he was a 'resourceful and intelligent' young man who was only two weeks short of his 18th birthday. However, her concerns grew when he failed to get his A Level results the following day and she spent August 16 searching Lowestoft and Norwich for any sign of him. She went on to make extensive public appeals to help find him, putting out messages nationally and internationally on social media. Detective Inspector Kevin Hayward of Suffolk Police said in a statement that Miller's home was first searched when his missing person status was changed from medium to high. Miller's cause of death was given as 'unascertained', and the coroner recorded an open verdict . Miller vanished on August 13, 2013, two days before he was due to receive his A Level results from £21,105-a-year Langley School in Loddon, Norfolk, where he was a weekly boarder . The inquest heard how one villager had seen him on August 13 when he was waiting for a bus to go to Lowestoft for a hair cut. Another had gave him a lift home in the afternoon and he later made arrangements to meet a friend on August 15 . A post mortem by Home Office pathologist Dr Ben Swift found no evidence of broken bones or injuries and gave his cause of death as 'unascertained'. There was also no evidence that he was a regular user of drugs, said Dr Dean. He added: 'Although clearly we have evidence that the body had been there some considerable time, there is still uncertainty over the exact circumstances over which Miller came by his death. 'The post mortem was unable to give a definitive cause of death so sadly there remain unanswered and unanswerable questions. There is no evidence to suggest foul play or the involvement of any other person.' Mrs Miller attended the hearing, but declined to comment afterwards. Mrs Miller said she had made a thorough search of the garden four days after her son disappeared, but found nothing, he was later found after two police searches .","Miller Redpath, 17, was last seen after 'difference of opinion' with mother .

"A nursing assistant who allegedly abducted University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has been charged with her murder, according to reports on Monday. Jesse Matthew, 33, was charged last year with the 18-year-old's abduction after she went missing on leaving a bar in Charlottesville, Virginia at 2am on September 13. A month later, Miss Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave behind a rural property, around eight miles from where she vanished. Her death was declared a homicide in November. Albemarle County authorities will now reportedly charge Matthew with first-degree murder. A press conference is set for 11am on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Jesse Matthew, 33, (pictured right in November) was arrested and charged last September with the abduction of 18-year-old Hannah Graham (left) who went missing in Charlottesville, Virginia. He will now reportedly be charged with her murder . In a statement, local authorities said on Monday that they would be making an announcement in the Jesse Matthew case at 11am and would not be providing any other information before hand. However sources told local station CBS6 that Matthew is to be charged with first-degree murder. Albemarle authorities refused to confirm reports of the murder charge ahead of the 11am press conference. DNA has linked Matthew to the disappearance and death of UVA student Morgan Harrington in 2009, who vanished after attending a gig in Charlottesville . The location where Miss Graham's remains were found in Albemarle County is close to Matthew's mother former home. Matthew grew up in the area and is familiar with the surroundings. Before Miss Graham disappeared, she texted a friend at 1am to tell them that she was lost. She was last seen on surveillance footage from a downtown mall in Charlottesville. Matthew was also seen on this footage. On September 24, Matthew was charged with abduction with intent to defile after being picked up by police in Galveston, Texas, around 1,300 miles away. He was extradited to Virginia to face charges. Matthew is now suspected in a string of unsolved deaths, disappearances and sexual assaults across Virginia over the last decade. DNA evidence has also linked Matthew to the disappearance of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who vanished after attending a concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her body was found a few months later, hidden at a remote farm. Samantha Ann Clarke, 19, disappeared from Orange County, Virginia in September 2010. DaShad Laquinn Smith, also 19, disappeared on West Main Street in Charlottesville in November 2012. As Matthew emerged as the main suspect in Miss Graham's disappearance, it was revealed that he had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years. A sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University in Virginia on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus. The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped. He dropped out of Liberty University on the day the allegation was made. Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University in Virginia where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003. Matthew has been linked to a string of young women's deaths, disappearances and sexual assaults across Virginia over the last ten years . Matthew's name has now been connected to the disappearances of DaShad Laquinn Smith, 19 (right), in November 2012 and Samantha Ann Clarke, 19 (left)  in September 2010. Both young women vanished in the Charlottesville area . Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. It is not clear how the second incident was resolved. Matthew is also charged in the sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2005. Mathew has pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and sexual assault in that case. In January, DNA testing cleared Matthew of involvement in the abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy, the 17-year-old Virginia girl who went missing in 2013 and has never been found. Following Mathew's arrest in October, the attorney for Randy Allen Taylor - the man convicted of Miss Murphy's murder - requested that Matthew be properly examined as a possible suspect in the teen's death. Graham was last seen with Matthew at a downtown bar in Charlottesville, Virginia. Her body was found a month later eight miles away behind a rural property . Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave behind this property just outside of Charlottesville, Virginia last October after a month-long search .","Jesse Matthew, 33, was charged with abduction with intent to defile in September in case of 18-year-old Hannah Graham .

"London's once seedy Soho district is now nearly a faint memory as luxury apartments and developments have begun to take over the neighbourhood. Gone are the days of sex shops, cabaret bars and a history of counterculture, as skyrocketing rent continues to soar. But one organisation is aiming to save Soho's 'gritty' ambiance and celebrities including Stephen Fry and Benedict Cumberbatch have even signed up to the campaign. Scroll down for video... London's once seedy Soho neighbourhood is now nearly a faint memory. Pictured: Walker's Court . Actress Gemma Arterton and comedian Eddie Izzard have also joined the call to keep Soho inclusive, along with talk show host Paul O'Grady and comedian Rob Brydon. While once a hub for musicians, actors, the gay community, night owls and just about anyone else, many fear that Soho will soon be regenerated beyond recognition and so this campaign hopes to declare the entire region a 'heritage zone.' Actor Stephen Fry, who has joined the 'Save Soho' campaign, which was founded by Tim Arnold, has even gone so far as to declare that he does not want the scruffy London district to end up looking like 'Singapore Airport'. Former Bond Girl Gemma Arterton (left) and comedian Rob Brydon (right) have lent their support to the campaign to protect Soho's unique ambience . And with a rich cultural and social history - cholera long ago ravaged the region, Karl Marx began his movement here, Amy Winehouse got her start in local nightclub Jazz After Dark, and The Who were discovered in the area - such concern is warranted. 'Soho has always changed, but the way it changed is by adding layer to layer,' Tim told Stuff.co.nz. 'What happens at the moment is that some of these layers are ripped away to replace them with something new.' In response, musician Tim Arnold has founded the 'Save Soho' campaign to halt rampant development . Other big name celebrities have also taken up the cause, such as Stephen Fry (left) and Benedict Cumberbatch (right) Today, more music venues and sex clubs have closed than can be counted and with it, Soho's seedy, bohemian soul is slipping away. Legendary performance club, Madame Jojo's, has been approved for demolition and one of the best live music venues, the 12 Bar Club, where the likes of Adele and Jeff Buckley played early shows, is likewise being forced to relocate. There is only one adult bookshop left on the former 'alleyway of sexual half-promises,' also known as Walkers Court, and Denmark Street, the legendary music hub, is slowly being taken over by a newly-modernised Tottenham Court Road tube station. In a video recorded to raise awareness of the campaign, Stephen Fry says: 'London simply wouldn't be London without Soho.' With iconic establishments like Madame Jojo's nightclub closing, the district is losing its gritty culture . He describes how the area is a 'unique blend of raffishness with a hint of wickedness' and adds: 'Its bohemian character, its identity as the gay and transgender centre of London, its association with live performance and late-night eccentricity and free expression - all these are a gift beyond price that Soho gives London and which gives London extra value. The well-respected comedian signs off saying: 'This rush to gentrify to maximise profits and London would be the loser so please save Soho.' The 12 Bar Club, where Adele and Jeff Buckley performed early gigs, is also being forced to relocate . Skyrocketing rents, along with the development of a new tube station has driven out local businesses . Westminster Council estimates that over 200,000 square metres of small commercial space has closed . In Arnold's quest to save Soho, his primary adversary is Soho Estates, which has been the primary developer behind recent neighbourhood 'improvements.' The company, however, maintains that each development still 'recognises the rich and creativy history' of the district. Westminster Council, however, estimates that nearly 200,000 square metres of commercial space - and many small businesses - have been lost recently.","The once seedy district is quickly fading as luxury developments move in .

"John Alite has taken a baseball bat to countless guys. He has stabbed, shot and killed dozens more. He has been pistol whipped, been brutally beaten, has had his life threatened and survived two years in a Brazilian jail so appalling that the President of the country has said he'd rather die than go there. Today he is a free man, immaculately dressed and drinking a vodka Martini in Manhattan's Peninsula Hotel. And this, he has just announced, is the hardest time he's ever had. Because according to Alite people don't change, yet change is precisely what Alite is trying to bring to his life and, he hopes, the lives of kids on the brink of making the mistakes he made decades ago. It's the reason, he believes, he's still alive. Speaking to Daily Mail Online he said, 'Honestly I've thought about it every single day. I believe I didn't do the right thing but I believe there's a reason why I'm supposed to be here. 'When people say you baseball batted a hundred people and stabbed however many, you shot 37, I can't forget it. Let me tell you how I justified it. I didn't hurt women. I didn't rob an armored car in my life because that's a hard working guy and I would never be prepared to hurt him. Scroll down for video . New life: Mob enforcer John Alite has put aside a life in the Mafia to become a motivational speaker. He says: 'You can fool someone who's not a gangster. But take a street guy, a real tough guy and they can read through all his b*****t. You can't fake it. But you can learn it.' Convicted: Just two of the mugshots Alite featured in, both taken in Brazil in 2003 and 2004 when he was arrested over a string of offenses and held in its most notorious prison . 'But did I rob drug dealers? Yes, all the time. Did I hurt street guys? Yes, all the time. Did I shoot street guys? Yes, all the time. Did I shoot people who were hanging out with wise guys? Yes, all the time. But outside of that? No. 'What I did, I can't take back and when I was doing what I was doing I was proud of it. But I have enlightenment now. Whether it's because I got into trouble or whether it's because I got disheartened from them turning on me, doesn't matter how I got it, but I did get it eventually.' Now, three years after his release from jail, he is 'reinventing' himself as a motivational speaker who hopes to 'scare kids straight,' give corporate employees an aggressive edge and consult on movies and TV shows trying to accruately portray the world in which he once live and excelled. For more than twenty years Alite was a high ranking member of the Gambino crime family. He worked for the Gottis – both father and son. He was, he said, 'at the top of the food chain', one of their top earners and enforcers. He could never be a 'made' man in the mafia because the grandson of Albanian immigrants was born in Tirana, Albania. But he thought he was moving in a world governed by rules; codes of honour, loyalty and respect. Then, when he was in jail in Brazil, Alite was passed secret 302s (files kept by the FBI documenting interviews with their informants) showing that John Gotti Jr, the man who had stood by him when he married his first wife in 1998, was 'a super-rat'. And everything changed. Boss: John Gotti, also known as The Dapper Don, who was at the head of the Gambino crime family. But Alite says that ultimately he and his son proved to be liars ad not men of honor . Friends turned enemies: John Gotti Jr (center) and John Alite (left) as friends in the mid-1980s. But they are now enemies, with Alite having given evidence against Gotti, who Alite says was himself a rat . According to Alite, he realized that he had bought into a lie – the 'seductive image' was just that, an image. The Gottis – father and son – were not men of substance but cowards, sold out by their own lawyer who, Alite said, handed over the 302s to his contact. Alite cut his own deal. In 2008 he secretly pleaded guilty to two murders, four conspiracies to murder, at least eight shootings and two attempted shootings as well as armed home invasions and armed robberies in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida. He testified in the trial of Gambino family enforcer Charles Carneglia – now serving a life sentence for four murders. He went onto testify against Gotti but after 11 days of deliberations the jury came back deadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial. The jury stated that they hadn't trusted prosecution witnesses – especially Alite. On April 26, 2011 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was released in 2013 having served six since his extradition. John Gotti Jr's role as an FBI informant has since emerged publicly but, much to Alite's, frustration it has gained fewer column inches than he feels it deserves and he rails against the fact that Gotti Jr's claim that he left the mob of his own volition is rarely publicly challenged. He said: 'In 1999 he claims he retired. In 2001 he gets caught on tape mad that his uncle brought him down from boss to skipper. In 2005 he gets caught co-operating. They shelve him. Meaning he was thrown out of the mob. 'There is no such thing as quitting. There's no two weeks' notice and there's no pension.' According to Alite, for whom this is all deeply personal, anything that preserves Gotti Jr's image is 'glorifying the mob.' He said, 'If you're glorifying the mob you're killing kids. You're teaching kids to respect the wrong thing. You're teaching them to respect a coward.' At 52 Alite still carries himself like the wise guy mobster he once was. He is physically fit, heavily tattooed and charismatic. He's the real deal and dangerously close to glamorizing the very thing against which he is speaking out by virtue of his own charm. But he insisted, 'I'm not proud of what I did. I lived then as if I was at war. I was like an alcoholic with violence. Now I'm not like that. Now I'm a little more controlled.' Now the services he offers are strictly cerebral. With 'Scared Straight and At Risk Youth' talks he draws on his own credibility as a mobster to dismantle any lingering delusions that there is anything glamorous or desirable about that life. Regrets: Alite has four grown-up children and says that he regrets not being a part of their lives as much as he should have been because of time spent behind bars . Mafia presence: John Gotti was at the head of the Gambino crime family and John Alite's boss. but now that the former mob henchman has gone straight he says: ' I'm doing it the right way.' He said, 'If I go into a juvenile center and talk to 300 kids ages 12 to 17 then I'm not going to reach all 300, but maybe I can reach one or five or 10. And I'll tell you now if I go in and talk to them or if a psychologist does this talk, they're going to listen to me, there's the difference.' Similarly the man who once prided himself on being the consummate predator is now offering his wisdom in anti-bullying speeches. He explained, 'Being a victim or not being a victim is all about the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you carry yourself. Same thing in the prison system. And a predator in those situations, in the street or in jail, they can sense it, they can feel it. 'You can fool someone who's not a gangster. John Gotti Jr could walk into this room and fool someone who's not a street guy. 'But take a street guy, a real tough guy and they can read through all his b*****t. You can't fake it. But you can learn it.' Once a millionaire many times over Alite was financially successful – legally and illegally – because, he said, he was 'aggressive'. When speaking to corporate clients he can offer 'experience beyond anybody's education.' And few can lay claim to inspiring the level of respect he once held, something, he insisted that has nothing to do with fear and everything to do with credibility. For his own part Alite is not without regrets. As a father of four adult children ages 18 to 25 he admitted: 'I feel really bad for my kids because I wasn't there for them because of my crazy lifestyle.' 'But,' he said, 'at some point in your life you have to take blame for what you did: right, wrong or indifferent. When someone says they don't feel guilt I think they're a liar or a sociopath. 'Truthfully at the time I thought I was invincible. Now I don't sleep well. I go to therapy all the time and it's a constant work in progress. 'Of course I miss the money. Of course I miss that I was a big shot. I'm like everybody else. I want to get the clothes, the nice things, but it's not worth it. Before I didn't care how I got it. 'Now, I don't want to lose direction and become the person I used to be. This is the hardest time I've ever had – trying to reinvent myself but I'm doing it through hard work, I'm doing it the right way.'

"Wealthy philanthropist Carroll Petrie's estranged daughter stands to lose a share of her late mother's $100million fortune. Petrie, the widow of investor and retailer Milton Petrie, passed away January 22 at age 90. The affluent Manhattan socialite was best known for her charitable endeavors, including the Carroll Petrie Foundation Dog Rescue Project run by the ASPCA, which had been one of Petrie's beneficiary. Petrie was passionate about animals and even made headlines when she donated $100,000 to the president of ASPCA asking to rescue a dog she had seen stranded on a house roof during Hurricane Katrina. Mother-daughter feud: Former model Andrea Portago (left) stands to lose her share of her estranged late mother Carroll Petrie's (right) $100million fortune . According to her will, Petrie had set aside $12.5million for her only daughter Andrea Portago, a former model-turned-photographer, but in the document she left a cryptic message that read, 'I have not obtained a valid court-issued order of protection against Andrea after the date of this will and before the date of my death,' reported New York Post's Page Six. Andrea, a former fashion model and daughter of Carroll Petrie's first husband, Spanish aristocrat and playboy race car driver Alfonso de Portago, had a strained relationship with her mother. It has been reported that the two woman had not seen each other for five years leading up to Carroll Petrie's death. Miss Portago, 64, has already retained the services of the high-powered Manhattan trust and estates attorney Harvey E. Corn, who has confirmed the mother and daughter's estrangement. The lawyer told the Post that Miss Portago allegedly had tried to see her mother before her death but was prevented from doing so. There is no word at this time if Miss Portago will challenge her mother's will, but her attorney said they have requested earlier versions of the document. Southern belle: Petrie, a native of South Carolina pictured here in 1991, passed away last month at age 90. Before her death, she wrote a  note in her will suggesting that her intention may have been obtaining an order of protection against her daughter . It is expected that a large portion of the glamorous socialite's fortune will go towards her foundation. Under Ms Petrie's will, each of her two granddaughters will receive $12.5mllion, and a million will go to New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where the late philanthropist had been a board member. Born to a Christian Baptist family in South Carolina, Carroll McDaniel attended Converse College and enjoyed a brief career in modelling before marrying Andrea Portago's glamorous father, Don Alfonso Cabeza de Vaca y Leighton, 17th Marquis de Portago. The two lived in Paris until Alfonso de Portago's death in a fiery car wreck in 1957. He was 28 years old. Two failed marriages later, Carroll said 'I do' to multimillionaire Milton Petrie - himself a three-time divorcee - in 1978. Over the course of their 17-year union, the prosperous and generous power couple gave away hundreds of millions of dollars to charitable organizations, hospitals and cultural institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which named a European sculpture court after the Petries in 1990. Mrs Petrie also sat on boards of the Gracie Mansion and the Central Park conservancies, and was a life trustee of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital. ‘She went everywhere. She was a great beauty and extremely elegant. She had a very, very Southern accent. She had many friends. She had a good sense of humor. She was a social hostess and gave many parties. It was fun to be there,’ Aileen Mehle, a long-time gossip columnist better known by her nome de plume, Suzy, said of her late friend in an interview with Women's Wear Daily. On bad terms: Portago, the daughter of Petrie and her first husband (pictured here with Kris Kristofferson at the premiere of Heaven's Gate in 1980), and her philanthropist mother had not spoken for five years . Mrs Petrie also held honorary doctorate degrees from New York Institute of Technology and Long Island University. In 1987, the King of Spain bestowed the philanthropist with the highest honor awarded to foreigners, the Medal of Honor of the Order of Isabel La Catolica. The New York Times reported that when Carroll Petrie’s husband Milton died in 1994 at age 92, he left her a $150million trust fund, ‘$5million in cash, two homes, including a Fifth Avenue apartment, planes, cars, jewels, art and antiques.’ Andrea Portago, the only surviving child of Carroll Petrie and her first husband, by all accounts has had a turbulent and fascinating life. In a 1977 profile published by People Magazine, then-26-year-old model talked about her privileged childhood, which she compared to that of the fictional character Eloise: wild rides with her playboy dad in his Ferrari around Paris; acting lessons at age 10; dance classes with legendary choreographer George Balanchine, and being bounced around a half-dozen boarding schools. The year the profile came out, the striking brunette graced the June cover of her friend Andy Warhol’s Interview magazine. 'She's going to be a very big star,' the pop art visionary said at the time of his muse.","Carroll Petrie, widow of investor and retailer Milton Petrie, passed away January 22 at age 90 .

"It was the novel which confirmed J.K. Rowling could address gritty adult issues as well as she could weave magic for children in the Harry Potter books. But it seems The Casual Vacancy was a little too bleak for the BBC. The broadcaster has decided that Rowling's first attempt at adult literature since the success of the Harry Potter series was too 'grim' for the small screen - so producers have rewritten the ending for  Sunday night audiences. Scroll down for video . The ending of JK Rowling's first foray into adult literature is too 'grim' for BBC's Sunday night audience . The three-part drama paints a bleak picture of modern Britain and involves storylines involving rape, drug abuse and racism. Pictured is Sir Michael Gambon and Julie McKenzie, who star in the upcoming mini-series . A television adaptation of The Casual Vacancy is due to begin screening on Sunday night. The three-part drama, starring Sir Michael Gambon, Keeley Hawes and Rory Kinnear, paints a bleak picture of life in modern Britain and features storylines involving rape, drug abuse and racism. Set in the fictitious English town of Pagford, it features a community of rich and poor at war over the future of a community centre called Sweetlove House, home to social services including a drug rehabilitation centre and a food bank. Pagford's wealthier residents, who are fed up with the centre being a haven for 'junkies and plebs' from a nearby council estate called The Fields, want to close it for good and turn it into a luxury hotel and spa. From left, Alex Lowe, Terri Weedon and Rory Kinnear are pictured in the upcoming adaptation of The Casual Vacancy . The raft of changes made to the storyline of The Casual Vacancy have not been limited to its ending. Pictured is actor Brian Vernell and actress Simona Brown in a scene from the BBC adaptation . They are bitterly opposed by the liberal faction on Pagford parish council who believe it is essential for social cohesion. But the story paints such a bleak picture of modern Britain that its scriptwriter said she told Rowling 'very straight' that the ending needed to change. The Casual Vacancy sold 125,000 copies in its first week on the market, becoming the fastest-selling hardback in the UK for three years and the second biggest seller since records began in 1998. But, it had a mixed response from critics when it was first released in September. The Guardian said it was 'unadventurous' with a 'righteous social message', while The Times said Miss Rowling had a 'sharp eye for vivid detail'. Daily Mail writer Jan Moir described it as: '500 pages of relentless socialist manifesto, masquerading as literature, crammed down your throat.' In 2013 a publisher admitted she turned down Rowling's pseudonymous thriller The Cuckoo's Calling after finding it 'perfectly decent but quiet'. But when Rowling was exposed as the author of The Cuckoo’s Calling by the wife of one of her lawyers, sales soared. Former EastEnders scriptwriter Sarah Phelps told the Radio Times: 'I was very straight with Jo and told her that I needed to write a different ending,' 'It's still heartbreaking, but I had to find some kind of redemptive moment at the end of it all - a sense that after the tragedy, someone gets to stand with a slightly straighter back. 'Nobody wants a finger wagged in their face, and I learnt on EastEnders that if you just go 'grim, grim, grim', viewers will simply disengage.' However, changes to the storyline have not been limited to just its bleak ending. Last week questions were raised over other edits to the plot, which some suggested were made in order to ramp up left-wing issues weeks before the General Election. Tory MP and former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind last week said the timing of the broadcast struck him as being 'very odd at least'. He said: 'In the run-up to a General Election, the Government quite rightly has to go into purdah and refrain from doing anything provocative. I think the BBC should have to apply the same criteria.' The drama does not mention any political parties but critics say the battle over Sweetlove House is a thinly disguised attack on the Government's welfare cuts, which will be one of the crucial issues for the May 7 Election. The Casual Vacancy sold 125,000 copies in its first week on the market, becoming the fastest-selling hardback in the UK for three years and the second biggest seller since records began in 1998.

Daily Mail writer Jan Moir described it as: '500 pages of relentless socialist manifesto, masquerading as literature, crammed down your throat.' In 2013 a publisher admitted she turned down Rowling's pseudonymous thriller The Cuckoo's Calling after finding it 'perfectly decent but quiet'. Kate Mills, fiction editor at Orion Publishing, said she couldn't see a USP for the crime novel, submitted to her by 'first-time author Robert Galbraith', in a 'tough' market. But when Rowling was exposed as the author of The Cuckoo’s Calling by the wife of one of her lawyers, sales soared. The publisher of The Cuckoo’s Calling had claimed it was written by a former plain clothes Royal Military Police investigator using the pen-name of Galbraith. Rowling was exposed after a mother-of-two posted a message on Twitter outing the 47-year-old as the real author. She had been told by a partner in Rowling’s legal firm Russells Solicitors, who told his wife’s best friend, in a private conversation. At the time Rowling released a statement saying it had ‘not been pleasant’ to spend days wondering how a woman unknown to her could expose a secret ‘that many of my oldest friends did not know.’ SCENE 1 . The BBC: In the opening scenes, Councillor Howard Mollison, played by Sir Michael Gambon, and his social-climbing wife Shirley (Julia McKenzie) discuss plans for a luxury hotel and spa development. A gleeful Shirley tells her husband: ‘It’s beautiful. You feel better just looking at it. You can’t let Barry Fairbrother and his tribe of do-gooders stand in the way of progress. They’ll have to accept that Sweetlove House has had its day.’ In the novel: The plan for a luxury hotel and spa does not appear at all. SCENE 2 . The BBC: Opposing the plans, Councillor Fairbrother says: ‘That is social engineering. That’s apartheid. Herding people into ghettos because they don’t fit the aesthetic. There is a name for that, isn’t there. Bill, you stormed the Normandy beaches didn’t you, fighting fascism... That house helps people to live. The parish council is not here to make a quick buck for someone who already has more than enough... Is the legacy still of benefit? Yes. It has never been so important.’ In the novel: Councillor Fairbrother dies on page two having hardly uttered a word. SCENE 3 . The BBC: When progressive councillor Parminder Jawanda tells her colleagues that drug addicts will have to travel to nearby Yarvil to get help, a rival tells her: ‘They would crawl on their knees over broken glass if there were drugs to be had.’ In the novel: She uses far milder language, saying addicts should have their benefits cut.","The Casual Vacancy's scriptwriter decided novel's ending was too 'grim'

"How many lightning strikes are taking place around the world every minute? If your answer is anything less than 300, you're in for a shock. A stunning interactive map has revealed just how much of Earth is subjected to lightning strikes every second, with an average of five taking place at any one time. And the scientists behind the map also want to use it to work out what effect climate change is having on thunderstorms, and how much lightning is due to increase by 2100. Below is the animation that you can use to view lightning strikes around the world, as recorded in October 2014 . To create the map, Professor Colin Price of Tel Aviv University's Department of Geosciences and TAU graduate student Keren Mezuman used the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). This is a vast global lightning network of 70 weather stations run by atmospheric scientists at universities and research institutes around the world . To create the map, Professor Colin Price of Tel Aviv University's Department of Geosciences and TAU graduate student Keren Mezuman used the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). This is a vast global lightning network of 70 weather stations run by atmospheric scientists at universities and research institutes around the world. It is capable of detecting radio waves produced by lightning - the main feature of a thunderstorm - from thousands of miles away. The TAU team harnessed this ground-based system to cluster individual lightning flashes into ‘thunderstorm cells.’ Every hour the exact GPS time of every detected lightning pulse was registered. Professor Price and his colleagues then calculated the difference in arrival times of signals, using data from four to five different stations to locate individual lightning strokes anywhere on the globe. Finally, the researchers grouped the detected flashes into clusters of thunderstorm cells. The map shows a record of lightning over a specific time, although it should be noted it is not in real-time. Researchers at Tel Aviv University created the using a global network of stations that detect radio waves - the main feature of a thunderstorm - from thousands of miles away. A lightning strike in British Columbia, Canada is pictured . This map shows lightning strikes at the present time. Lightning stroke positions are shown as coloured dots, which 'cool down' from blue for the most recent (occurring within the last 10 minutes) through green and yellow to red for the oldest (30 to 40 minutes earlier). Red asterisks in white circles are active  sensor locations. The terminator, or boundary between day and night, in grey and black respectively . ‘When we clustered the lighting strikes into storm cells, we found that there were around 1,000 thunderstorms active at any time somewhere on the globe,’ said Professor Price. The researchers, pooling seven years of data analysis, found that every day lightning activity on earth peaked at 1900 UTC, with low activity at 0300 UTC every day. While previous studies had estimated 90 per cent of lightning flashes occurred over land areas, the TAU team found that only 50 per cent of the thunderstorms cells existed over land areas, implying that land storms have much more lightning than ocean storms. ‘How lightning will be distributed in storms, and how the number and intensity of storms will change in the future, are questions we are working on answering,’ Professor Price said. The researchers, pooling seven years of data analysis, found that every day lightning activity on earth peaked at 1900 UTC, with low activity at 0300 UTC every day. Lightning over Sedona, Arizona is pictured . Research by the University of Reading in November 2014 found over a five-year period the UK experienced around 50 per cent more lightning strikes when the Earth's magnetic field was skewed by the sun's own magnetic field. Dr Matt Owens said: 'We've discovered that the sun's powerful magnetic field is having a big influence on UK lightning rates.' The findings could pave the way for an accurate forecasting system to warn of possible electrical storms many weeks in advance. The research will likely be crucial to measuring the impact of climate change on thunderstorms. The varying frequency and intensity of thunderstorms have direct repercussions for the public, agriculture, and industry. ‘To date, satellites have only provided snapshots of thunderstorm incidence,’ said Professor Price, whose new map of thunderstorms around the world is the first of its kind. ‘We want to use our algorithm to determine how climate change will affect the frequency and intensity of thunderstorms. ‘According to climate change predictions, every one per cent rise in global temperature will lead to a 10 per cent increase in thunderstorm activity. ‘This means that we could see 25 per cent more lightning by the end of the century.’ While lightning might seem like it's rare on Earth, travel to space and it's a whole different story. There, as astronauts orbit Earth, they can see a huge amount of lightning down below, and in a recent video and images Esa revealed some of the views astronauts are afforded. An incredible series of images was captured by astronaut André Kuipers on the ISS on 11 June 2012, during Expedition 31. Lightning was captured over Eastern Romania (shown) at about 8:55pm UTC, and a video was made by stitching together 49 images taken on the ISS while travelling at 17,100mph (27,600km/h) Estimates suggest that 100 discharges can occur between the system of clouds and the surface of Earth each second, causing many lightning strikes, so for astronauts seeing such a sight is not all too rare. Shown is another image by André Kuipers . The incredible series of images was captured by Dutch Esa astronaut André Kuipers on the ISS on 11 June 2012, during Expedition 31. The lightning was captured over Eastern Romania at about 8:55pm UTC, and a video was made by stitching together 49 images taken on the ISS while travelling at 17,100 mph (27,600 km/h). Estimates suggest that 100 discharges can occur between the system of clouds and the surface of Earth each second, causing many lightning strikes, so for astronauts seeing such a sight is not all too rare. As the clouds are so vast, however, they are not always visible from the surface. But from the ISS the lightning is much more visible - and when astronauts orbit Earth, they can often spot lightning in clouds from above. The pictures followed amazing images of lighting in the eye of a cyclone revealed in January, also captured by an astronaut on the ISS. The incredible views of tropical cyclone Bansi were spotted in the Indian Ocean near the island of Mauritius, when the ISS was east of Madagascar. This image by Italian Esa astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti show lighting in the eye of a tropical cyclone Bansi in January. The incredible views were spotted in the Indian Ocean near the island of Mauritius, when the ISS was east of Madagascar . In the images the calm ‘eye’ of the storm can be seen illuminated by lightning and surrounded by swirling clouds as it made its way across the ocean. They were taken by Italian European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti aboard the ISS in January this year. They show the swirling motion of the storm around the central blue eye. According to Nasa, the wall of the eye is being illuminated by a flash of lightning in the centre of the storm - which also lights up nearby clouds. The low-light settings of the camera used to take the image accentuate the contrast.","Researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel have created a map showing lightning strikes around the world .

A test of the explosive off San Nicolas Island in California showed the missile ploughing through a shipping container attached to a moving ship with such force that it punched a hole and emerged on the other side to bounce along the surface of the water.

'This success further demonstrates the existing capability of Tomahawk as a netted weapon, and in doing so, extends its reach beyond fixed and re-locatable points to moving targets,' Captain Joe Mauser, Tomahawk Weapons System (PMA-280) program manager for Naval Air Systems Command, said in a statement. The Tomahawk Block IV – unlike earlier versions of the missile – has the ability to adjust its flight path based on new information given to the missile allowing it to hit moving targets. Unclassfied video footage of a Raytheon Tomahawk missile test in January was obtained by USNI news. It shows the explosive being launched from a guided missile destroyer USS Kidd. The missile is fired powerfully into the air in a plume of smoke and travels considerable distance before it is seen punching through a container. In an unclassified video the missile is shown heading for the red metal shipping container as it moves . The powerful explosive punched a hole all the way through the large shipping container during the test . The explosive then emerges out of the other side and bounces along the surface of the ocean. A previous tomahawk missile with a 200 nautical mile range was previously developed by the Navy in the 1980s, but there was a lack of technology to control it or ensure it hit the correct target. Due to its limited success and the danger of hitting friendly or neutral ships, the missiles were developed into land attack tomahawks. Video footage shows the missile being fired, at long range, from USS Kidd, in the middle of the ocean . As the missile tears through the air it hones in on the metal shipping container out at sea . It is hoped the successful test could pave the way for missiles to be used to boost the American navy's fleet . The missile is shown hitting its target successfully and punching through the metal with explosive force .

"A 14-year-old boy who accused a teacher's aide of molesting him 'has serious behavioral issues' and is 'often suspended from school', it has been claimed. Mother-of-one Maria Contreras, 29, a substitute paraprofessional at the Bronx Academy of Letters in New York, was arrested on Saturday for her alleged affair with the mentally-ill student. But on Sunday an attorney rebutted the criminal charges and said the student is 'a special needs boy with serious behavioral issues.' Maria Contreras, a substitute teacher from New York, was taken into custody on Saturday and charged with multiple sex offenses after allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old mentally-ill student . Contreras was taken into custody  and charged with multiple sex offences for her alleged affair with the underage boy. Married Contreras, who worked for the city's Department of Education, was taken to the Bronx Special Victim's unit in handcuffs and denied the allegations as she spoke to waiting reporters. Police said the boy, who was one of Contreras's students, would walk to her apartment where they had sex at least six times in November, according to The New York Times. Officials announced she had also been fired from her job. A spokesman for The Department of Education released a statement to ABC 7 saying: 'These allegations are incredibly disturbing. 'Ms Contreras has been removed from her position and will no longer be employed.' Contreras, who was arraigned on Sunday, has been charged with six felony counts of second and third-degree rape for each alleged encounter. The 29-year-old allegedly had sex with the  schoolboy while she worked at the Bronx Academy of Letters . She is also charged with two felony counts of second-degree criminal sex act with a minor for alleged oral sex acts, court documents state. At the court hearing, a judge ordered Contreras to be held in lieu of $25,000 bond and $10,000 cash bail. But attorney Ruth Hamilton said that while the boy's accusations should be 'seriously considered', there are no witnesses, physical evidence, video or text messages to support the allegations. 'We have to keep in mind that this is the word of a special needs boy with serious behavioral issues, who is often suspended from school,' she told NBC New York. 'She has never been alone with him.' Hamilton added the school requires a teacher to be in a room with students at all times, so Contreras could not be alone with a student at the academy. 'This is an accusation that does not ring true,' she said.","Married Maria Contreras, 29, arrested on Saturday and taken into custody .

"Urban Outfitters has once again angered consumers with one of its designs, this time with a tapestry that closely resembles a Nazi concentration camp uniform forced upon male gay prisoners during the Holocaust. Anti-Defamation League, an organization dedicated to fighting antisemitism, issued a statement yesterday calling for Urban Outfitters to stop selling the tapestry; which is not listed on the retailer's website, but was photographed at a store in Boulder, Colorado. 'Whether intentional or not, this gray and white stripped pattern and pink triangle combination is deeply offensive and should not be mainstreamed into popular culture,' said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL's national director and a Holocaust survivor. Offensive? Urban Outfitters' tapestry, pictured (left) in a Colorado store, is said to closely resemble a Nazi concentration camp uniform forced upon male gay prisoners during the Holocaust (right) Mr Foxman stated: 'We urge Urban Outfitters to immediately remove the product eerily reminiscent of clothing forced upon the victims of the Holocaust from their stores and online.' Between 1933 and 1945 the Nazis arrested up to 100,000 gay men and the death rate for homosexual prisoners in the camps was said to be 50per cent. The tapestry in question does not currently appear on Urban Outfitters' website, but a store clerk from its Boulder store told The Daily Dot she 'recalled seeing it sold in the last few months' but added it was no longer available. Urban Outfitters' other tapestry designs retail for between $39 and $69, and are described as being 'the perfect piece for topping off your bed, wall, or favorite chair', or used as a 'beach or picnic blanket'. A representative from the clothing giant is yet to respond to Daily Mail Online's request for comment. Not the first time: In 2012, ADL took offence to a $100 yellow T-shirt sold by Urban Outfitters (left) which it deemed too similar to the yellow Star of David worn by Jewish people in Nazi Germany (right) Well-trodden path: In 2003, ADL targeted Urban Outfitters once again over a T-shirt with a message reading, 'Everyone loves a Jewish girl', surrounded by dollar signs (pictured) It's not the first time ADL has criticized designs sold by Urban Outfitters. In 2012, it took offence to a $100 yellow T-shirt with a blue six-pointed star etched over the chest; imagery ADL deemed uncomfortably close to the yellow Star of David worn by Jewish people in Nazi Germany. 'We find this use of symbolism to be extremely distasteful and offensive, and we are outraged that your company would make this product available to your customers,' wrote Barry Morrison, Philadelphia regional director of the organisation. The T-shirt was subsequently recalled and its designer Wood Wood responded by saying the design was 'in no way a reference to Judaism, Nazism, or the Holocaust.' More controversy: In 2011, the retailer sold a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase 'Eat Less' (right) and last year, a T-shirt which read 'Depression' (left) - both drew criticism for glamorizing mental illness . Insensitive: Last year, it recalled what appeared to be a blood-spattered 'Kent State' sweatshirt (pictured), which many interpreted as a reference to the 1970s Kent State massacre . And in 2003,  ADL targeted Urban Outfitters once again over a T-shirt with a message reading, 'Everyone loves a Jewish girl', surrounded by dollar signs. Other more recent controversies include the retailer selling what appeared to be a blood-spattered 'Kent State' sweatshirt last year, which many interpreted as a reference to the 1970s Kent State massacre, although Urban Outfitters denied any previous knowledge of the crime. In 2011, it sold a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase 'Eat Less', which was recalled after critics lambasted Urban Outfitters for glamorizing eating disorders. Similarly, last January, the retailer was forced to stop selling a T-shirt stamped with the phrase 'depression', after critics complained that it trivialized mental illness.","The retailer's tapestries are touted as 'the perfect piece for topping off your bed, wall, or favorite chair'

"A mother has accused her daughter's elementary school of fat-shaming the six-year-old girl for sending her home with a note saying she needed a health check. Laura Cacdac was shocked when her daughter Charley, a healthy first-grader, returned home from Palm Beach Gardens Elementary in Florida with the letter after undergoing weight and height tests. 'From the results of this test, it is suggested that your child's health be examined by a physician, particularly as it relates to the problem suggested by the screening,' it read. 'A problem such as this that goes uncorrected or untreated can severely affect both the health and academic performance of your child.' Scroll down for video . Hurt: Charley Cadac, left, was sent home with a letter last week telling her family to get her health checked after her BMI was found to be too high. Her mother, Laura Cadac, right, accused the school of fat shaming . The letter, sent by the school nurse, called for the family to take the six-year-old girl to the doctor for tests . Cacdac was stunned - and her daughter, who had read the letter, was hurt. The girl is 4ft 2 and weighs 60 pounds, her mother said. 'Her first question to me was ""do they think I'm fat? Is there something wrong with me?""' Laura Cacdac told WPTV. 'It is basically in my opinion telling me I am harming my child and doing wrong by her and then telling me how to properly feed my child.' Charley said she was worried when she saw the letter. 'Because if I was fat, it would make me sad and kind of feel bad, like I was kind of different than everybody else,' she told WPBF. Palm Beach Gardens Elementary screens children in line with state law. When Cacdac called the school, the nurse said the girl's Body Mass Index was high - meaning that, according to state standards, her daughter is overweight.

But her mother insisted that doctors have said the girl is healthy and said she enjoys a good diet. 'My child's favorite foods are avocados, broccoli and apples,' Cacdac said. 'She is perfectly healthy in every way: emotionally, physically, and academically.' She said she fears the impact the test will have on her daughter and believes it should have been communicated to the family better. She has now opted her daughter out of the screenings. 'Something like this can stick with her for the rest of her life,' she said. 'It is going to stick in her head. ""Am I fat? Do they think I'm fat?""'

"George Remus, a Cincinatti lawyer, was known as 'King of the Bootleggers' and may have been the inspiration behind F. Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby . A Cincinnati lawyer who was known as 'King of the Bootleggers' and turned to crime after noticing his clients were getting rich may have been the real life inspiration behind The Great Gatsby. George Remus was born in Germany in 1874, before his family moved to Chicago when he was five. After supporting his family by working in a pharmacy from the age of 14, he bought the pharmacy at 19, expanded and bought another in his early twenties before deciding to become a lawyer aged 24. He specialised in criminal defence, particularly in murder cases and by 1920 he was earning $50,000 a year - a huge amount at the time. In 1920 Remus divorced his first wife Lillian after embarking on an affair with his legal secretary, Augusta Imogene Holmes, whom he subsequently married. That year U.S. Congress decided to ban toting or selling alcohol - but bizarrely, drinking was still allowed. 'Remus soon noticed the criminals he was defending  were getting rich off bootlegging,' Roy Hotchkiss of the Price Hill Historical Society told the Cincinnati Enquirer. 'He saw all this money and thought he'd better get in on the action.' Remus began studying the Volstead Act – the law that enforced Prohibition – and soon found several loopholes. His pharmaceutical background came in handy when he realized the loopholes meant he could buy distilleries and pharmacies to sell 'bonded' liquor to himself under government licenses for 'medicinal' purposes. Remus's employees would then 'steal' his liquor so he could sell it on illegally. By this point he had moved to Cincinnati and bought up most of the whiskey manufacturers. In less than three years Remus made $40 million - in today's currency  almost $900 million. George Remus shared many characteristics with the character of Jay Gatsby (pictured is Hollywood actor Leonardo di Caprio as Gatsby in the 2013 film) - he was overly generous, ostentatious and yet introverted . He owned many of America's most famous distilleries, including the Fleischmann Distillery, which he bought for $197,000 - a price which included 3,100 gallons of whiskey. In addition to becoming the 'King of the Bootleggers' Remus was known as a generous host. He held many parties, including a 1923 birthday party for Imogene in which she appeared in a daring bathing suit, serenaded by a fifteen-piece orchestra. Remus enjoyed flaunting his wealth - his mansion in Price Hill was decorated in rare art and exotic plants. For his daughter Romola he installed a massive indoor pool at a reported cost of $125,000. He was renowned for throwing lavish galas and events where he showered guests with expensive gifts. Imogene Remus (pictured left) had an affair with George before he divorced his first wife. He later shot and killed her after she spent his money while he was in prison. The cover of the novel The great Gatsby (right) He and his wife held a New Year's Eve party at their mansion in 1922. As parting gifts, Remus presented all the men with diamond watches and gave each woman a brand new car. But despite his overt generosity Remus was an introvert. He did not drink or smoke and during parties he would sometimes retreat to his personal library – much like Jay Gatsby. Mr Hotchkiss said: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald met Remus by chance at a hotel in Louisville. 'The writer was fascinated with this larger-than-life personality, and based the eponymous character in 'The Great Gatsby' on Remus. 'There used to be a photo of Remus surrounded by the police chief, Capone and Fitzgerald, all in laughter. He truly was a character that transcends time.' Remus was also seen as charitable, donating money and presents to those in need - along with those who were perhaps not so needy. 'Remus had an untold amount of bribes to the police, lawyers and government,' Mr Hotchkiss said. He allegedly even paid off the U.S. Attorney General of the time. Writer F. Scott Fitzgerald met Remus (pictured) by chance at a hotel in Louisville and was fascinated with this larger-than-life personality - he apparently based the eponymous character in 'The Great Gatsby' on Remus . But his luck finally ran out and in 1925 he was charged with thousands of violations of the Volstead Act and was sentenced to a two-year prison term in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. But according to biographers he still managed to throw a lavish party on his private train coach to Georgia. While behind bars he enjoyed his meals at the prison chaplain's residence, his cell was always decorated with flowers and he was even waited on by servants. His cellmate was Franklin Dodge and the pair got on so well Remus even confided how he was hiding his personal assets from the government - by keeping his wife Imogene in charge of his estate. But Dodge was an undercover FBI agent, sent to prison to investigate a corrupt warden. Dodge, for his part, did not tell the agency but instead resigned his post and headed to Cincinnati. There he embarked on an affair with Imogene Remus and helped to spend most of her husband's empire, leaving Remus destitute. She sold his mansion, his distilleries and all of his possessions, leaving him just $100. After Remus left prison Imogene filed for divorce, but on her way to the courthouse to finalise it Remus had his cab driver chase her down. She was forced to abandon her vehicle in Eden Park and in front of a shocked crowd Remus shot and killed her. George Remus owned this property on Rapid Run Pike in Cincinatti, Ohio during the peak of his career . The subsequent trial attracted national attention. The prosecution was led by Charles Phelps Taft II, the son of former President William Howard Taft. Despite the testimony of several witnesses, Remus was found not guilty by reason of insanity. There were rumours of trial fraud, a theory that appeared proven when Remus threw a celebratory party after the verdict with all 12 jurors in attendance. Remus' stay in the asylum was short as he used Taft's reasoning that he was not insane to get himself back out again. A free Remus tried to restart his bootlegging venture, but found other bootleggers had taken control of the market in his absence and so he retired, dying in 1952 of natural causes aged 77.","George Remus was a lawyer turned bootlegger during U.S Prohibition .

"A primary school headmaster has quit his post suddenly, claiming the bureaucracy of a 'faceless government' has left him unable to focus on his job. Neil Jackson, 52, head of Hadleigh Community Primary School, Suffolk, said he could not continue because he was constantly 'frustrated by having to tick boxes and jump through hoops'. The headteacher, who has held his post for four years, made the announcement in a letter to parents on Friday. Resigned: Mr Jackson, pictured outside Hadleigh Community Primary School, Suffolk, announced his move in a letter sent home to parents on Friday. He blamed 'faceless government' bureaucracy for the move . Mr Jackson said that, irrespective of which party is in government, headteachers were being 'constrained' to what they 'can and can't do'. He added that government rules meant members of staff were left 'constantly stressed and exhausted by the huge amount of paperwork which they are required to complete'. It comes nearly a year after his school, which has 584 boys and girls aged from 3-11, was handed a 'requires improvement' Ofsted grade. The report found that teaching 'was not consistently good across the school' and that pupils' 'achievement is not good'. It added that targets set by the school's leadership team are 'not focused', leading to confusion as to whether improvements are helping pupils. A monitoring inspection, carried out since then found that some improvements were being made. Quit: Mr Jackson said there was no definitive date for when he would be leaving the school, pictured above . Mr Jackson said that while the result was 'not the only reason' for his decision, it had 'made him realise' that schools are 'solely judged on children's progress'. Last year three headteachers left Suffolk primary schools because of 'significant challenges' posed by changes to Ofsted inspections - which are now conducted as more frequent, but shorter visits. In the letter, which was also published on the school's website, Mr Jackson wrote: 'The role of a headteacher in modern Britain is completely different to what it was and I constantly find myself frustrated by having to tick boxes and jump through hoops for a faceless government who do not understand what providing wonderful, creative learning opportunities for children is all about. New head: Suffolk County Council is working with school governors to find a 'suitably experienced replacement' for Mr Jackson in a 'timely fashion' 'I therefore feel that I cannot continue in the role of a headteacher. 'Whilst our Ofsted inspection was not the only reason for my decision, it certainly made me realise that irrespective of which government is in power, schools are solely judged by children's progress and that headteachers in particular will be constrained with regard to what they can and can't do.' Mr Jackson, a former  headteacher of Bucklesham Primary School, said no definite date had been set for when he would leave but he has requested it is before the end of the academic year. He said he 'could not continue' in the role of headteacher but is due to stay in education. Geoff Barton, headteacher of nearby King Edward VI School in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, said Mr Jackson's  letter gave a 'bleak picture' of leading a school which he said can be a 'very lonely' job. Mr Barton said: 'It fits with the national picture that both at primary and secondaries more headteachers are thinking about stepping down and it can be incredibly difficult to recruit people.' He said work was under way to strengthen the support network which is in place through the Suffolk Association of Secondary Headteachers. No one was available to comment from the Suffolk Primary Headteachers' Association. Inspection: Mr Jackson's resignation comes a year after his school, which has 584 boys and girls aged from 3-11, was handed a 'requires improvement' Ofsted grade last year. Above, an extract of the report . Vicky Neale, headteacher at County Upper School in Bury St Edmunds, said being a headteacher carried a large responsibility. She said: 'Teaching and being a headteacher has a heavy workload. It's also a very important job and it's right that there is strong accountability. 'I would not say there's more work now than there was five years ago.' She added that, while staff worked hard, she would not say they are 'stressed and exhausted'. Mr Jackson's resignation comes after three headteachers left Suffolk primary schools because of 'significant challenges' posed by changes to Ofsted inspections. Lisa Chambers, Suffolk County Council's cabinet member for education and skills, said: 'We wish Mr Jackson the best in his future endeavours. 'Following his decision to resign, our priority is to work with the school's governors to ensure that Hadleigh Community Primary School receives the support it needs to find a suitably experienced replacement head teacher in a timely fashion.' The Department for Education said in a statement: 'We want to support the profession to tackle the issue of unnecessary and unproductive workload, which many teachers are concerned about and is stopping them from giving time to what really matters - inspiring young people to achieve their potential. 'That is why we launched the Workload Challenge. 'We received over 44,000 responses and are now acting on those to ensure teachers are able to carry on with their fantastic work and prepare pupils for life in modern Britain.' Mr Jackson's letter to parents: 'To all Parents, carers and children at Hadleigh Community Primary School, . 'I am writing to you today to tell you that after a great deal of soul searching, I have decided to resign from my position as headteacher here at Hadleigh Community Primary School. 'It is not a decision I have made lightly; this is a fantastic school, with wonderful, talented children, inspirational staff, supportive parents and proactive, challenging governors. 'I would like to take this opportunity to explain to you why I am leaving the school; please do understand that I am not leaving to take up another headship elsewhere, I am leaving headship completely. 'The role of a headteacher in modern Britain is completely different to what it was and I constantly find myself frustrated by having to tick boxes and jump through hoops for a faceless government who do not understand what providing wonderful, creative learning opportunities for children is all about. 'I therefore feel that I cannot continue in the role of a headteacher. 'Whilst our Ofsted inspection was not the only reason for my decision, it certainly made me realise that irrespective of which government is in power, schools are solely judged by children's progress and that headteachers in particular will be constrained with regard to what they can and can't do. 'Hadleigh Community Primary School has many wonderful, talented staff; good, conscientious people who are constantly stressed and exhausted by the huge amount of paperwork which they are required to complete. 'I consider myself to be a very approachable, honest headteacher and when staff ask me how to achieve a better work/life balance, I can no longer give them an answer. 'After much soul searching, I am going to put my family and myself first. 'Please do be assured that I will work hard to lead the school as effectively as possible in the coming months, until I leave. 'I was offered a new job on Wednesday February 4 and telephoned David Smyth (chair of governors) straight away in order to allow governors and senior leaders the time and opportunity to ensure that the children's education would not be jeopardised in any way at all. 'However, in light of the change in circumstances, a deputy headteacher was not appointed yesterday. 'As I write this letter, I am aware that David Smyth is meeting senior leaders at Suffolk County Council in order to ensure that the school does not suffer in any way at all. 'Please do be assured that the school governors are incredibly astute and aware of their responsibilities with regard to your children and that they will now work tirelessly to advertise for and appoint my successor. 'The senior leadership team have already met to draw up an action plan with regard to the future of the school and I would ask you to trust them as they ensure that ""life at Hadleigh carries on as normal"". 'I have enjoyed four years here at this fabulous school and am so proud of everything and everyone connected to it.

"A Cold War-era bunker has been put up for auction - complete with instructions on what do in a nuclear fallout. The underground shelter, which can only be accessed by a ladder, has lain empty for more than two decades in Burton Joyce, Nottinghamshire. It was manned by volunteers from the Royal Observers Corps (ROC) as the world braced itself for nuclear war at the height of tensions between the West and the Soviet Union in 1961. But the well-hidden safety bunker has been empty since the site was shut down in 1991. A Cold War-era bunker has been put up for auction - complete with instructions on what do in a nuclear fallout.

"Alberto Julian Meza, 25, has been arrested for dressing as a baby as a ploy to gain access to the homes of elderly women in Paraguay . A 25-year-old man conned his way into the homes of dozens of elderly women by dressing in nappies and sucking a lollipop as a ploy to steal from them. Alberto Julian Meza pretended to be a lost toddler and asked for help to find his mother in the South American city of Paraguay. Locals in the town of Villa Elisa, a suburb of Asuncion, said Meza was regularly seen walking around the streets and most people had assumed he was mentally ill. However, Meza was using the disguise to get inside peoples' homes at which point he would steal whatever was at hand while they were making him a snack or getting him a drink. Police have arrested Meza, but locals are surprised it took them so long. Lara Orta Ornelas, 59, said: 'He has been doing this for years and I know the police have had complaints before, but it's incredible that they never realised the baby is actually a fully grown man. You can see him walking around the streets most days and a fully grown man in nappies is not exactly hard to find.' Claudia Paiva, 43, told local TV: 'This man has been going around like this for a very long time and we are all amazed that they are only doing something right now about it.' A police spokesman defended the time it took police to make an arrest saying that the few complaints they had received all concerned the actions of a child, not a man dressed as one. The spokesman said, as a result they had not been looking for an adult man in a nappy. Meza was dressed in nappies and was carrying a lollipop and a bottle of milk when he was arrested . Police apprehended Meza after receiving a report that someone had been robbed by a man dressed as a baby with a lollipop. Meza was later found still dressed as a toddler. He was wearing nappies and was carrying a lollipop and a bottle of milk.

"A protective Michigan mother has been jailed after stabbing a woman who was fighting one of her adult daughters. Octavia Dickens, 57, from Detroit, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of a misdemeanor aggravated assault, and began serving a four-month jail sentence yesterday. Dickens said that she was defending her daughter, who was bleeding during the altercation that took place last November outside the family home. During the incident on November 3, Dickens said a group of people knocked on her door, and her two daughters, Shonta Thrash, 33, and the other daughter who has not yet been named, 20, opened it. Octavia Dickens, 57, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of a misdemeanor aggravated assault and began her four-month jail sentence at Wayne County Jail yesterday (above Wayne County Jail Division II) While she was upstairs watching a movie, Dickens heard a disturbance outside and looked out the window and noticed her daughters were on the ground, according to the Detroit Free Press. Her daughters had previously been involved in an incident with the 19-year-old three hours before, who showed up at the house with her 17-year-old sister and friend, a court document said. A group of people with the three girls were at the house watching the altercation. 'I had to go out there and get them off of my kids,' said Dickens. She said she became involved because she was worried what would have happened if she had not stepped in. The 19-year-old  said that she was on top of Dickens's daughter when she was stabbed with the knife once in both her hand and abdomen. She spent two days in hospital after undergoing surgery on her abdomen. Her 17-year-old sister also said Dickens jabbed her with the knife but that it did not go through the skin. Both of Dickens's daughters were taken to hospital following the incident, with one daughter receiving six stitches for a cut near her left eye, and the other had a swollen face and said she could not hear from her left ear. Thrash, who was present along with her sister at the sentencing, said she felt her mother was just ‘protecting them’. Dickens admitted during a hearing at Wayne County Circuit Court that she used a small paring knife to 'poke' a 19-year-old woman who was fighting her daughter. She accepted a plea deal yesterday and was dismissed of two felony counts including assault with a dangerous weapon and intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. The mother requested to begin her jail sentence immediately at the Wayne County Jail so that she could be released sooner. If the case had gone to trial, Dickens could have faced nearly 23 months in prison. 36th District Judge Kenneth King said during the preliminary proceeding in November that the case 'disturbed' him. He said that he was not justifying what Dickens did but that if he had been in her situation as a parent, watching her daughter be attacked by a group of people, that he cannot say he would have acted any differently. No one else has been charged in the case, according to officials. Sentencing in the case is scheduled to start on February 24.","Octavia Dickens from Detroit stabbed woman, 19, with small paring knife in the hand and abdomen .

"The HPV vaccine does not cause riskier sexual behavior in teenage girls or raise rates of STIs, according to U.S. researchers. There have been concerns among some parents that the vaccine against human papilloma virus (HPV) causes riskier behavior in teens and raises rates of sexually transmitted infections. But the new findings by a team of experts from Harvard Medical School and the University of Southern California were published yesterday in a journal of the American Medical Association. University of Miami pediatrician Judith L. Schaechter gives an HPV vaccination to a 13-year-old girl at the Miller School of Medicine on September 21, 2011 in Miami . Health authorities recommend the vaccine for pre-teen and teenage boys and girls as a way to prevent HPV. If undetected HPV can lead to cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, mouth and throat. But just 38 percent of girls aged 13-17 in the United States had received all three recommended doses in 2013 and even fewer boys were vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccination rates have been slowly rising in the years since 2006 when the vaccine was first introduced. In 2013, the most recent year for which officials have data, 57 percent of girls and 35 percent of boys began the HPV vaccine series with at least one of the three recommended shots, the CDC says. But experts say they would like to see higher rates of vaccination. Robert Bednarczyk of Emory University wrote in the report: 'Just as we do not wait until we have been in the sun for two hours to apply sunscreen, we should not wait until after an individual is sexually active to attempt to prevent HPV infection.' A close-up of the the human papilloma virus (HPV) - if undetected HPV can lead to cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, mouth and throat . In an effort to see if vaccination could be linked to higher STI infection rates, the study compared 21,000 girls who were vaccinated to 186,000 unvaccinated girls of the same age. Both groups had the same insurance plans and lived in the same area of the United States. Rates of sexually transmitted infections were measured four times per year, for the year prior to vaccination and the year after. The girls who were vaccinated had slightly higher rates of STI than the unvaccinated girls, both before and after vaccination. Researchers said they believe these higher rates were attributable to the higher likelihood of sexual activity among girls who are getting vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated girls. However, both groups experienced an increase in rates of STIs as they grew older, and this increase occurred at the same pace, whether or not the girls had received the vaccine. The study said: 'This suggests that the girls' sexual behaviors were not altered in the least by the vaccine. 'Any behaviors resulting in infections that did occur were independent of the vaccine.' Researchers said if the HPV vaccine had caused an increase in risky sexual behavior they would have found a higher rate of STIs among vaccinated girls after they received the vaccine, since it only protects against HPV and not any other diseases. Seth Seabury, study co-author and associate professor of research in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Southern California said:'We found no such increase, causing us to conclude that there was no association between using the vaccine and unsafe sexual practices,' According to Anupam Jena, assistant professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, the findings should be seen as good news for concerned parents. He said: 'Since this is one of the few medications ever developed that can actually prevent cancer, it's good to be able to reassure parents, physicians and policymakers that the vaccine does not promote unsafe sexual practices among girls and young women.' The study was funded by a grant from the US National Institutes of Health. What is HPV? The human papilloma virus is the name given to a group of viruses that affect a person's skin as well as the membranes lining the body - for example, in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. HPV is very common and highly contagious. More than three quarters of sexually active women acquiring it at some point in their lives. And in the U.S. it is the most common sexually-transmitted infection. The human papilloma virus is a group of more than 100 viruses that affect a person's skin, and membranes lining the cervix, anus, mouth and throat . Most people are oblivious to the fact they have been infected and as a result can pass it on to a partner without realising. There are more than 100 types of HPV - around 40 of which affect the genital area. What does HPV infection do? The majority (nine in 10) of infections disappear of their own accord within two years. But the other 10 per cent of infections can cause health problems, including: . The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different to those infections that cause cancer. Other HPV infections can cause more minor problems, including common skin warts and verrucas. How do people get HPV? HPV is a sexually-transmitted infections. In most cases a person will become infected after having vaginal and/or anal sex. Men and women can also become infected through oral and other sex play. In many cases a person will not realise they are infected, and can still have HPV years after coming into contact with an infected person. In very rare cases a pregnant woman can pass HPV to her baby during delivery. In these cases a child can develop recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a rare condition where warts grow in the throat. The HPV vaccine . A national vaccination programme for HPV is in place in the US and UK for girls aged 12 and 13. Three injections are given within a 12-month period by a nurse. The vaccine is given at a young age because it needs to be administered before a person comes into contact with HPV. It has also been found to provide greater immune response in preteens, than it does in older teenagers and young women. Clinical trials have showed the vaccines provide close to 100 per cent protection against precancers and for HPV4 - genital warts. Since it was first recommended in 2006, there has been a 56 per cent reduction in HPV infections among teenage girls in the US. Protection offered should be long-lasting, with trials showing the vaccine lasts in the body for at least 10 years. HPV vaccination does not replace the need for regular cervical smear tests in women between the age of 25 and 65.

"All six of the people killed in a railroad crossing collision between a commuter train and an SUV in  New York City's suburbs suffered blunt-force injuries and burns, a medical examiner announced on Tuesday. A brief statement released by Westchester County did not specify the cause of death for any of the victims. It also did not specify whether the blunt-force injuries were caused by the impact inside the train on the tracks or by the pieces of third rail that speared into both vehicles during the February 3 accident. Scroll Down for Video . Blunt force trauma and burns were the cause of death: Six people - five passengers and the driver of the vehicle - died when a Metro-North train hit an SUV which had stopped on the tracks during the evening rush hour, 30 minutes outside of New York City . The collision killed five men on a Metro-North evening commuter train and a mother-of-three, Ellen Brody, 49, whose Mercedes SUV was hit by the train at a grade crossing in Valhalla. Morgan Stanley employee Aditya Tomar, 41, banker Eric Vandercar, 53, Met museum art curator Walter Liedtke, 69, research scientist Robert Dirks, 36, and Joseph B. Nadol, 42, of Ossining were also killed in the crash . A fire erupted, apparently fueled by the SUV's gasoline, and 12 sections of the railroad's electrified rail pierced the SUV and the train car. The findings were based on autopsies conducted by the office of the county medical examiner, Dr. Kunjlata Ashar, the county said. The statement said Ashar's final report and conclusions will not be completed until the National Transportation Safety Board finishes its investigation several months from now. Terrifying: The true horror of the New York train crash was revealed in the investigators' photographs which showed parts of the carriage burned beyond recognition . Investigation begins: An NTSB worker on Thursday examined the burned-out shell of the Metro-North train which was involved in Tuesday's crash in Valhalla, New York . Report could take months: A federal investigator examines a section of the first carriage which was now a wreck of twisted metal. Preliminary findings revealed the train was traveling below the speed limit and the barrier signals were working correctly . Accident: Married mother-of-three Ellen Brody was identified as the driver of an SUV which was hit by a train on Tuesday in Valhalla, New York when she stopped her vehicle on the tracks. Morgan Stanley employee Aditya Tomar, 41, also died . The train, braking hard, hit the SUV at 48 mph and traveled about 1,000 feet before coming to a stop, the NTSB said. The third rail penetrated the Mercedes SUV and then the first car of the train, breaking into its 39-foot sections and 'coming in, in, in, in,' U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Friday. He added that seeing inside the burned-out rail car was 'like looking into a coffin.' The NTSB said it would use information from the autopsies and from surviving passengers' injuries, coupled with a diagram of where people were sitting, to try to determine how people were killed. The NTSB is also asking questions about whether Metro-North's unusual third-rail arrangement, which involves taking power from the bottom of the rail, led to the splintering of the rail, which investigators said they had never seen before. Another key question is why the SUV driver, Ellen Brody, was in the path of the train. A witness said her car was hit by the dropping crossing gate and she then drove forward and was hit by the train. The NTSB has said the crossing gates and lights were working properly. Last week the first images from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation showed the blackened shell of the engineer's booth at the front of the train, the outside a wreck of twisted metal. The interior of the first carriage was scorched and in parts burned beyond recognition. Preliminary findings revealed that the driver Ellen Brody, 49, was on the tracks for about 30 seconds in her Mercedes SUV before the train impacted. Perished: banker Metropolitan Museum art curator Walter Liedtke, 69, (left) died in the crash as did banker Eric Vandercar, 53 . Tragedy on the commute: Research scientist Robert Dirks, 36, (left) and Joseph B. Nadol, 42, of Ossining were also killed in the crash . The driver of the vehicle behind the Mercedes told NTSB investigators on Thursday that traffic was 'edging along' at the railway crossing in Valhalla, an affluent town north of New York City, Robert Sumwalt, an NTSB member, said at a news conference. The Mercedes came to a stop on the crossing, Sumwalt said. The barrier descended on its rear window. The crossing warning lights began flashing and sirens started to ring out, and the driver behind her described reversing to make room for her to retreat, gesturing with his hands, Sumwalt said.

The crossing warning lights began flashing and sirens started to ring out, and the driver behind her described reversing to make room for her to retreat, gesturing with his hands, Sumwalt said. Instead, he watched as Mrs Brody, a married mother-of-three who worked in a local jewelry shop, got out of the Mercedes and inspected the barrier without moving it before getting back into the driver's seat. The Mercedes SUV was skewered by the electrified 'third' rail of the tracks after the train impacted on Tuesday evening . Recovery: Workers prepare for a crane to lift the crushed SUV from the front of a Metro-North commuter train on Wednesday . 'Then she sat in the vehicle,' Sumwalt said. 'He described it as if she had enough time to put on her seatbelt.' Investigators also interviewed the engineer on Thursday who was driving the crowded rush-hour train. He told them that he spotted the Mercedes ahead of him, Sumwalt said. The engineer deployed the train's emergency brake, and the train's horn blew again for four seconds. Meanwhile, the driver behind the Mercedes watched as Brody 'suddenly pulled forward,' Sumwalt said. 'As she did so, the train struck the car,' Sumwalt said.

Investigators were seeking SUV driver Ellen Brody's records and trying to figure out how familiar she was with the route and her vehicle . In this aerial photo, personnel from various agencies work the scene of a deadly SUV and commuter train accident in Valhalla, around 30 miles from New York City . The train, pushing the Mercedes down the track, took nearly 30 seconds and 950 feet before coming to a stop after the emergency brake was activated, Sumwalt. Long pieces of electrified 'third' rail skewered the Mercedes and pierced the first two train carriages as a gasoline-fueled fire erupted. Passengers riding the train's rear remained oblivious to the carnage unfolding ahead of them. Sumwalt said his team were seeking Mrs Brody's records and trying to figure out how familiar she was with the route and her Mercedes. The crash is the deadliest rail accident in the New York area in more than three decades. It was the latest in a string of accidents to unnerve commuters on the country's second-largest commuter railroad.","Medical examiners report released on Tuesday into last weeks MTA Metro-North crash .

"A mother-of-three who is living on benefits is set to go from rags to riches after she was handed her £1.3million family home and Turkish holiday villa in a divorce battle. Ellen Debruin, 51, started claiming benefits when she split from 45-year-old Stephen Debruin, an international haulage contractor, in 2010, Appeal Court judges were told. In 2013 a judge ruled Mrs Debruin should be given the two properties as well as an endowment  worth £16,000. Mr Debruin was also ordered to pay £800 in monthly maintenance. But Mrs Debruin has yet to receive any of the assets as her former husband has contested the ruling was 'grossly unequal'. They will not be transferred for the duration of his appeal. Battle: Ellen Debruin, 51,  started claiming benefits when she split from Stephen Debruin, 45, an international haulage contractor, in 2010. Above, the former couple pictured outside London's Appeal Court today . This means that Mrs Debruin is able to continue collecting payments - including child benefit, child tax credit and income support - until a decision is made. Today, a lawyer for Mr Debruin told the Appeal Court in London that the ruling was unfair and had failed to take into account his ex-wife's potential to earn a wage. He added that Mrs Debruin, who continues to live in the former marital home in Hornchurch, Essex, has a pension worth £70,000 while Mr Debruin does not have one. The couple married in 1992 and had three sons, now aged 14, 16 and 20, together before the relationship collapsed. Mrs Debruin was plunged into depression by the split, the court heard. A divorce judged ruled that Mrs Debruin should be given ownership over their five-bedroom home in Hornchurch, Essex, as well as 'Villa Debruin' - their holiday home in Turkey. She was also handed the endowment policy, while Mr Debruin was ordered to make maintenance payments indefinitely. Ruling: A judge ruled Mrs Debruin should be given the £1.3million home in Essex, pictured, their holiday villa in Turkey and an endowment worth £16,000. Mr Debruin also ordered to pay £800-a-month in maintenance . Mark Emmanuel, representing Mr Debruin, told Lords Justice Longmore, Ryder and Briggs today that the division of the marital assets was 'grossly unequal'. 'The husband's share was worth £97,000. He claimed debts of £126,000,' he told the court. 'The judge did not make any findings that the husband has undisclosed assets, whether specifically or by drawing adverse inferences. 'Such a grossly unequal distribution was not explained and is therefore plainly wrong. 'The judge awarded the wife the former matrimonial home, a holiday villa in turkey, an endowment policy worth £16,000. Benefits: Mrs Debruin, pictured, receives child benefit, child tax credit and income support . 'The wife has no liabilities and has a pension worth £70,000. The husband had no pension,' Mr Emmanuel added. The barrister complained that the judge failed to consider whether Mrs Debruin would be able to earn a living of her own in the future. 'The husband was also ordered to make periodical payments of £800-a-month to the wife, without any findings as to his income, or income needs, or the wife's earning capacity. 'No term was imposed,' he told the court. Mr Emmanuel added that, under the judge's order, 'the husband was left with his half share in two industrial units in Rainham, Essex' from 20 years of work and marriage. The court also heard arguments that the judge had no right to include the former matrimonial home as part of the 'pot' for division between the warring ex-couple. That was because the house had been transferred to a Lichtenstein-based company and trust in 1999, 'for tax reasons', the judges were told. Christopher Wagstaffe, representing the two overseas entities, argued the divorce judge was wrong to reach behind the corporate veil. After hearing the arguments, the judges opened the way for Mr Debruin to mount a challenge to the division of assets in the High Court Family Division. His case will now be heard by a senior family judge at a later date. Mrs Debruin was also ordered to pay £40,000 towards her ex-husband's legal costs, although that order will not, for the moment, be enforced. Emphasising that her finances remain extremely tight, her counsel, Ian Robbins, said: 'She is not in employment; she is on benefits'. Outside court, Mrs Debruin's lawyers said that her benefits had not been affected by the orders for maintenance and division of property, as they could not be enforced pending the outcome of her ex-husband's appeal. They confirmed that Mrs Debruin 'is in receipt of a number of benefits, including child benefit, child tax credit and income support' and that 'she obtained them post-separation.' In his 2013 ruling, splitting the assets of the marriage, Deputy District Judge Parker detailed the emotional toll the divorce had had on both husband and wife. 'The wife has been suffering from depression as a consequence of the breakdown of her marriage to Mr Debruin and these proceedings,' he said. Mr Debruin was also 'somewhat distressed and in a difficult position in terms of his own life, having had a number of breakdowns'.

"Robert Mugabe has suspended no fewer than 27 bodyguards for failing to stop his embarrassing fall down podium steps, sources have claimed. The 90-year-old Zimbabwe President was caught on camera taking a tumble after addressing supporters at Harare Airport last week. His security team scrambled to help him to his feet and desperately tried to brush over it by purportedly forcing photographers to delete their pictures of the incident. But it failed to stop social media users having their fun at the dictator's expense with a series of hilarious memes. Information Minister Jonathan Moyo later tried to claim that there was also no evidence that Mugabe had actually tripped over, but instead had 'managed to break the fall'. It has now been reported that 27 members of his security team were suspended on Friday pending an official investigation. Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe, 91, tripped as he came down some podium stairs at the airport . He had been addressing his adoring supporters on his return from an African Union meeting in Ethiopia, where he became the 54-nation organisation's chairman . An official source told Zimbabwe'sThe Standard: 'There are many departments that are being investigated, from Air Zimbabwe, the advance team and the security. 'I doubt if some of them will come back. The issue here is simple. The security team was caught napping.' The source claimed the bodyguards 'failed to adhere to basics' by not standing within three feet of the President. 'These are the bullet-takers and in cases where he falls they are supposed to hold him either by the arm or by the shoulder and should never take their eyes off him,' the official added. Presidential spokesman George Charamba has denied any suggestions of a shake-up. However, a number a new bodyguards were reportedly seen with Mugabe at a meeting on Friday. Photographers who caught the accident claim they were asked to delete their pictures by security personnel . Mugabe had been talking to the crowd at Harare International Airport, who had gathered to welcome him back from a trip to Ethiopia - where he had been elected chairman of the 54-state African Nation. It is understood the President - who has overseen his once-prosperous nation's steep decline since starting to seize white-owned farms in 2000 - was helped up quickly by aides, before being whisked away in his waiting limousine. Zimbabwe's government tried to deny that the President had tripped at all, saying said Mugabe, 90, did not fall down the steps, but 'managed to break the fall.' Information Minister Jonathan Moyo  cited examples of leaders who have stumbled, from Jesus to George W. Bush, adding that, despite photos spreading around the globe, there was also no evidence that Mugabe had actually fallen. 'What happened is that the president tripped over a hump on the carpet on one of the steps of the dais as he was stepping down from the platform but he remarkably managed to break the fall on his own,' Moyo told the state-owned Herald newspaper. 'I repeat that the president managed to break the fall.' Did you enjoy your trip? We certainly did! How social media users responded to Mugabe's fall with these hilarious memes . The picture of Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe falling down a set of steps after holding a speech was quickly turned into an internet meme. Using the hashtag 'Mugabe Falls', images showing the 90-year-old president in a series of funny situations began spreading  online. The memes features a cut-out image of Mugabe in various imagined circumstances, such as part of Beyonce's Single Ladies choreography, surfing or running from security forces.

"Tavarius McNair is just 14 years old. A softly-spoken boy with thick-rimmed black glasses and a mournful air, he seems gentle and is clearly devoted to his mother. And yet, McNair is one of 150 boys living in C-Complex, a wing of Pendleton Juvenile Correctional Facility in Indiana that specialises in the treatment of young sex offenders. Like an estimated 70,000 juvenile offenders across the US, McNair, and his room mate Garrett Clutter, 15, is a 'chomo' - a child molester. Scroll down for video . Locked up: Tavarius McNair, 14, wants to be a scientist but is one of 70,000 teen sex offenders in the US . 'I did a sexual offence on a family member,' explains McNair. 'My friends tell me they will kill me if they see me again. I feel like people see a label on me now because of that one thing. I feel lost.' The child of a single mother and an absent father, McNair's childhood was blighted by his mother's drug addiction which she funded by turning to prostitution. And his story is by no means unique. 'The majority of the boys have come from very difficult backgrounds,' explains Matt Pelly, who spent a month inside the prison filming new documentary, Kid Criminals. 'Most of them aren't bad eggs. They do it out of bad decision making.' Both McNair and Clutter are taking part in a programme aimed at rehabilitating the boys and turning their lives around. If they pass the nine-month course, they will be released and have their record wiped clean. If not, they will stay in the facility indefinitely. Tough: Pendleton Juvenile Correctional Facility houses 150 teenage 'chomos' - slang for child molester . Troubled: McNair, left, and room mate Garrett Clutter, right, have both endured troubled childhoods . The programme, which is overseen by an army of counsellors, has produced a re-offending rate of around seven per cent - half the amount of recidivism found among adult sex offenders. 'They're in here for sexual misconduct with animals, young children,' explains one Pendleton counsellor in an attempt to explain how the children end up on the programme. 'They're having sex with animals, their younger sisters, each other... Some of them are watching porn at a very young age. That has to have something to do with it.' Sadly, the treatment doesn't always work as the case of William McConnell, Pendleton's most notorious sex offender, reveals. McConnell, now 18, has been in sex offender treatment programmes on three separate occasions and was first sent to the facility aged 15. Each time he has been released, he has re-offended and has to be kept in segregation and monitored 24 hours a day, thanks to his predilection for grooming the younger boys. He complains to staff and constantly asks to be moved to a room where he can watch the other boys in the shower. Tough: Boys are allowed out of their wing for an hour of exercise in the prison grounds once a day . Notorious: William McConnell, 18, is kept segregated due to his predilection for grooming younger boys . Nevertheless, he insists that should he leave, other children will be safe from him. 'I have been in here three times because they don't think I can control my sexual issues,' he explains. 'But I can. One of the worst things I did was sexually abuse a kid to get revenge on my mentor because I wanted him fired.' McConnell says his own history of abuse, which began when he was first placed in care aged six, has left him a troubled individual. 'I've been abused by my biological family and in care,' he reveals. 'I've had a pretty rough life. Everyone says I'm really messed up in the head.' McConnell, who expects to be released before he is 22, will leave Pendleton knowing that if he re-offends again, his next stop will be adult jail. For the others, among them 15-year-old Clutter, release means the chance to attempt to build a 'normal' life. 'My family has forgiven me,' he says. 'Do I deserve it? Probably not. I just want to live a normal life. I want to be a marine biologist.' Clutter, who says he first saw pornography online aged eight, is the child of a loving mother and an abusive father, a man who disappeared three years ago when allegations of abuse were laid at his door. Gentle: McNair, seen with his friend Clutter, is devoted to his mother and wants to feel cared for . Troubled: Garrett Clutter was himself a victim of violent abuse at the hands of his father . His father, who he first met aged five, would physically abuse him during visits to his house and once threw him into a washing machine and switched it on. 'For me, being abused made it feel like something was missing in me,' he says. 'I call it the hole. My dad would use corporal punishment, he'd make me stand in the corner all night. 'It's crazy not being able to live with myself because all the time I was a little kid, I'd be thinking, did I do something to deserve this? Am I really this bad that he has to do this stuff to me?' But, as with McNair, Clutter's troubled childhood resulted in sexual abuse of others, in his case, attacking a younger female family member over a period of four years. Children like Clutter and McNair are helped by counsellors, among them Tammi Prince who is in charge of dealing with the younger boys. 'The counsellors were saints,' says Pelly. 'Miss Prince helps these kids through really dark times.  Counsellors are like surrogate parents for these kids.' For her part, Prince, who has heard some of the most harrowing stories imaginable, says she has been desensitised to much of what she hears - and says that is a good thing. 'At first I got chills but with time, I've become desensitised,' she explains.'I think that helps them [the children] because I'm not looking at them with shock all the time.' But not all of the young inmates are easy to deal with. 'The inward kids are the ones you have to pay the most attention to,' she says. 'They're the ones you have to watch. They're the masterminds.' One child who doesn't appear to be any sort of mastermind is McNair, who Prince describes as 'one of my most interesting boys. He's troubled.' All McNair really wants is to see his mother. 'It's been five months since I saw my mom,' he says. 'I'm alone up here, so I want to see her more. 'Sometimes I blame her for not being a better parent. But she's never given up on me. Without her, I'd be much worse.' McNair, who says his crime was motivated by wanting 'someone to care for me', also has big plans for the future. 'I've always wanted to be a scientist,' he says, smiling shyly. 'I want to do something with science. Maybe that is my calling.'","Pendleton Juvenile Correctional Facility houses 150 teenage sex offenders .

"For years drivers have been told not to use their phones on petrol station forecourts. But from April, Shell customers will be encouraged to use these devices to pay for petrol when the firm rolls out a mobile payment scheme. Customers at the majority of Shell’s 1,000 stations will be able to fill up their car before using an smartphone app to buy fuel without ever having to queue. Later this year, customers at the majority of Shell’s petrol stations will be able to use their smartphone to pay for fuel without leaving their car (illustrated). The petrol giant has partnered with PayPal to produce the free service available on iPhone and Android handsets . The petrol giant has partnered with PayPal to produce the free iPhone and Android service, and customers will be able to use the service through either the Shell Motorist App or the PayPal app. After driving into the forecourt, the customer selects the corresponding pump on the app by scanning a QR code. The app then authenticates the transaction and the customer can fill up and go. When refuelling is complete, a receipt is automatically sent  to the phone, letting the consumer drive away, knowing the transaction was a success. The technology was trialled in 2013 and members of the Shell Drivers’ Club will be able to try a pilot service in April, before the payment system is rolled out nationwide later this year. Customers will be able to use the service through either the Shell Motorist app or the PayPal app. Here, a women is shown using the app to choose the PayPal option and select the correct pump. The app then authenticates the transaction and the customer can then fill up and drive away . The technology was trialled in 2013 and members of the Shell Drivers’ Club will be able to try a pilot service in April, before the system is rolled out nationwide later this year. A stock image of a Shell garage is shown . Shell's app is designed to be used inside a car ans not on the forecourt, to avoid safety issues. Article 115 of the General Traffic Regulations prohibits 'keeping the engine, lights, as well as electrical systems such as the radio or devices that emit electromagnetic radiation turned on'. But mobile phones are low-power radio-frequency transmitters (between 450 and 2700 MHz), with a peak power value that ranges between 0.1 and 2 watts, according to Telefonica. Because these devices only use a tiny amount of energy, the company said it is unlikely it would trigger an explosion unless it had a defective battery. BP, however, claims that if you drop a mobile phone, a spark can be produced when the batteries are knocked loose. This could be hazardous because of the flammable vapours produced by petrol products. The United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association (UKPI) added that mobile phones are dangerous at a petrol station as they can distract a driver. 'Mobile phones are not designed and certified for use in explosive atmospheres which exist temporarily around the pump and nozzle during refuelling as well as around the fill and vent pipes during petrol deliveries. 'Whilst the risk of incendive sparking from mobile phones is low, they are not intrinsically safe devices and should not be used in those hazardous areas that exist on a forecourt.' ‘We’re committed to providing a fast, safe and secure service. '[Customers] will now have the flexibility and convenience of paying without having to leave their car,’ said Michael Hominick, retail marketing manager retail at Shell UK. ‘Those who want to go in store and pay or purchase other items will still be able to, with the benefit of reduced queues.’ There is some debate about whether mobile phones are dangerous when used at petrol stations. Article 115 of the General Traffic Regulations prohibits 'keeping the engine, lights, as well as electrical systems such as the radio or devices that emit electromagnetic radiation turned on'. Some people argue that phones are too low-powered to trigger an explosion, but BP claims a spark could be produced if a phone is dropped and its battery knocked out. However, Shell's app is designed to only be used inside cars to allay these safety fears. Michael Hominick, ​Retail Marketing Manager at Shell UK told MailOnline: 'It is safe to use a mobile phone from within a parked, stationary vehicle on a forecourt, but while on forecourts, we want customers to remain attentive and aware without the distraction of looking at their mobile phones. 'As a result, mobile payment is an in-vehicle experience only. 'This has been approved by Shell’s Primary Authority Partner, the London Fire Brigade.' PayPal isn't the only payment service to collaborate with a fuel giant. Customers at Chevron stations will soon be able to choose to purchase fuel using Apple Pay. The move was confirmed by Chevron in December when it tweeted: 'We are working alongside Apple to develop solutions to integrate with Apple Pay at the pump by early 2015.' Chevron has so far supported Apple Pay in its convenience stores and under its Texaco brand since the launch of the mobile payment platform in October, but it's thought the new app will be designed for users of the iPhone 6, 6 Plus and Apple Watch. Apple Pay works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. PayPal isn't the only payment service to collaborate with a fuel giant.

"He bought four houses surrounding his multi-million dollar home after discovering that a developer planned to turn one of them into a huge estate that would have 'a direct view into his bedroom'. Now, it has emerged that Mark Zuckerberg is locked in a legal battle with his backdoor neighbor, Mircea Voskerician, who sold the Facebook CEO the property in 2013 instead of fulfilling his plans. Voskerician has claimed Zuckerberg promised him entree into the Silicon Valley elite in exchange for the  house in Palo Alto, California, which the developer then sold the rights to  at a 'discount rate'. He is now suing the 30-year-old billionaire, who lives in his adjacent mansion with his wife, Priscilla Chan, based on allegations including fraud and misrepresentation. Zuckerberg denies the claims. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (left) is locked in a legal battle with developer, Mircea Voskerician (right), who sold him the contractual rights to a property in Palo Alto, California, for $1.7million in 2013 . Next-door neighbors: In November 2012, Voskerician reportedly sent Zuckerberg a letter saying he planned to tear down the property behind his home and replace it with a 9,600sq-ft mansion. Above, the two properties . In November 2012, Voskerician reportedly sent Zuckerberg a letter saying he planned to tear down the property behind his home and replace it with a 9,600sq-ft mansion, which he would then sell. 'The real estate developer was going to build a huge house and market the property as being next door to Mark Zuckerberg,' a source told The San Jose Mercury News at the time. In the letter, Voskerician apparently told the tech executive, who is worth an estimated $33billion, that the mansion would have a direct view of his home, including his 'yard and master bedroom'. If 'Mark plans to live there long term, he has 'one shot to ensure his privacy is where it needs to be,' the developer wrote in an email to once of Zuckerberg's people, according to Bloomberg. However, he then made Zuckerberg an unusual offer. Deeming himself a 'good neighbor', he proposed to sell  a slice of the property at '100 per cent premium' to grant him more privacy. Two weeks later, the pair came to the agreement that Zucerkberg would buy Voskerician's contractual rights to the entire house for $1.7million, which the latter described as a 'steep discount'. Billionaire's mansion: In the letter, Voskerician apparently told the tech executive, who is worth an estimated $33billion, that the mansion would have a direct view of his home (pictured), including his 'master bedroom' Disputed properly: If 'Mark plans to live there long term, he has 'one shot to ensure his privacy is where it needs to be,' the developer  told Zuckerberg's people. Above, the property Voskerician sold the rights to . The billionaire subsequently snapped up a further three homes nearby to guarantee his privacy. In a  lawsuit, which is ongoing, Voskerician claims that Zuckerberg promised to introduce him to valuable contacts in Silicon Valley in exchange for the sale of the property, it is reported. In an April 13, 2013, email, the developer, who lives in Palo Alto with his wife, Eva, told Zuckerberg: 'First I am happy that I could maintain your privacy by selling you the Hamilton property. 'Second, I wanted to meet and shake hands for the transaction and discuss your offering of working with you in the future as you stated you have built Facebook on connections that you have with others in Silicon Valley.' He also told Zuckerberg one of the reasons he  sold him the house, aside from privacy, was 'your offering to help me get my homes, development projects, in front of your Facebook employees'. Voskerician says that although both he and Zuckerberg agreed on the deal, nothing was put into writing. However, the Facebook founder's lawyers have strongly denied the claims. Email exchanges suggest that Zuckerberg and his inner circle had no intention of helping Voskerician in anything other than a 'light' way. But the developer's lawyer has disputed this. Unless both parties reach a deal, the case will go to trial. If Voskerician wins, he may be awarded back the property, situated in Hamilton Avenue in the once-ordinary California area. Couple: After paying Voskerician $1.7million for the rights to the property, Zuckerberg reportedly bought the lot from its owners for a total of $4.8million. Above, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, in November . In emails, Makan described Voskerician's offer to maintain Zuckerberg's privacy on his conditions as an 'obscene proposal', while the CEO's wife  said it made her 'sad and angry'. Over several months, Voskerician allegedly kept sending emails to Zuckerg's team, prompting them to worry that he could cause problems from 'either a security or PR standpoint'. In an email, Zuckerberg's assistant, Andrea Besmehn, reportedly told the firm's head of executive protection that the billionaire 'does remember saying that he would help this guy in a ""light"" way.' After paying Voskerician $1.7million for the rights to the disputed property in 2013, Zuckerberg reportedly bought the lot from its owners for a total of $4.8million. Voskerician claims his interest in the property was worth far more than $1.7million, saying the discount was based on the prestigious contacts Zuckeberg had allegedly promised him. Makan's firm later bought  three other homes surrounding Zuckerberg's house - which is less than a 10-minute drive away from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park - to secure his privacy. The houses in Palo Alto, situated 35 miles south of San Francisco and 14 miles north of San Jose, were reportedly snapped up for $10.5million, $14million, and $14.5million. In addition to claims of fraud and misrpresentation, the lawsuit also accuses Zuckerberg of breach of contract. Voskerician's and Zuckerberg's lawyers declined to comment on the article.","Mark Zuckerberg locked in legal battle with developer Mircea Voskerician .

A Chinese couple who left to go into town to do some shopping returned to find their home, pictured above, had been demolished by a factory owner who wanted to expend his business . Fan Jianguo, 85, and his wife Shao, 83, had refused to give up the lease on the property and had been in a dispute with the factory owner for eight years; the couple had lived in their home for 40 years . Factory owner Liang Chin negotiated with the owner of the land that the couple's home was on to secure the land and demolished the couple's home as soon as they went out . The couple had lived in the house together for 40 years and had only left 'for a few hours'. Mr Jianguo said: 'We didn't just lose our home, we lost everything we possessed. Photographs, jewellery, all our furniture from the TV through to the kitchen sink, and all of our clothes apart from those that we were wearing. Everything was destroyed.' The police force responsible for the village of Longkou, near Guangzhou City in southern China's Guangdong province said they are powerless to act as it was a civil matter. The couple are now trying to get the money together for a lawyer so they can sue the factory owner. Local council spokesman Long Chu said there was nothing the council could do, although it was now trying got find the Jianguos alternative accommodation. Mr Chu said the property was knocked down 'as a result of the dispute' between the couple and the factory owner lasting eight years. He added that technically the landowner should not have been allowed to sell on the lease without permission of the leaseholder.

Mr Jianguo said losing his home was 'difficult to take in'. He said: 'I really don't know now where we will even live from one day to the next.

With Valentine's Day just around the corner, it's time to inject a little passion into your life, and while I can't advise on hearts and flowers, I can definitely give you a helping hand when it comes to creating the perfect scarlet pout. This week I've selected my top five red lipsticks and come up with a few tips on choosing your ideal shade. Scroll down for video . Binky Felstead says there is no better way of guaranteeing a Valentine's kiss than with a scarlet lip. here she shows you the secret behind five classic looks. Pictured: Binky wears the starter red - Clarins Joli Rouge Lipstick in Hibiscus . THE STARTER RED . If you're a little bit scared by full-blown scarlet, a good place to start is with a subtle shade of pinky red. These softer, magenta hues are less dominating than a bold blood red and they flatter all skin tones. My favourite is Clarins Joli Rouge Lipstick in Hibiscus, a satin formula that glides on beautifully straight from the bullet and colours your lips in a warm, glistening sunset shade. Long-wearing and wonderfully moisturising, this is a great everyday red. THE FASHION RED . Right now, it's bang on trend to pair bright red lips with understated eyes and cheeks - you'll see all the celebs sporting this look. So a classic bright, fiery tone is a must for all fashion-conscious red-lipstick lovers. For a fashion red,  opt for bright fiery tones using a shade called Romance from the Binky London range . My favourite is a shade called Romance from my own Binky London range (above left). Okay, I may be a little biased, but I've tried and tested hundreds of reds and this one really is incredibly flattering - working equally well against pale, creamy complexions and golden tanned skins. Binky London Lipsticks are all also enriched with vitamin E, which leaves your lips feeling super-soft and moisturised - and just waiting to be kissed! THE FEMME FATALE RED . When it comes to red lips for a glamorous night out or a romantic date, the shade to go for is a deep, dark, sultry scarlet. I've chosen another lipstick from my Binky London range, this time in a shade called Merlot. For the femme fatale look, Binky says to go for a deeper scarlet, like this Merlot shade from her Binky London range . These rich, ruby reds look passionate, dramatic and sensual - they really make a statement. Thanks to its rich, hydrating formula, you can apply this lipstick straight from the bullet, but when I'm wearing a strong shade and want to create the perfect finish, I prefer to apply my red lippy with a lip brush to create a really polished, professional finish. THE DAY TO NIGHT RED . Bold, tomato red is a real go-anywhere colour. Elegant and feminine by day; playful and vampy by night, it's a true cosmetics classic - the little black dress in lipstick form! Guerlain KissKiss Shaping Cream Lip Colour in Love Kiss is a vivid, vibrant shade, with a luscious, moisture-rich formula that gives it great staying power - exactly what you want for your a 24-hour pout. Pair this colour with another classic look - the cat's-eye eyeliner flick - and whatever time your Valentine calls round, you'll be feeling irresistible. A vivid and vibrant shade can go from day to night in an instant, using a lipstick like Guerlain KissKiss Shaping Cream Lip Colour in Love Kiss . THE HOLLYWOOD RED . If you're after a dazzling pillar box shade - a real showstopper - then look no further than Clarins Rouge Éclat Lipstick in Passion Red. A gorgeous red-carpet red, this lipstick makes a perfect accompaniment to glam smoky eyes. Plus the silky Clarins formula will keep your lips feeling smooth and won't dry out or bleed throughout the evening. The Hollywood red is the most classic of all and suits most skin tones (pictured: Clarins Rouge Éclat Lipstick in Passion Red) Best of all, the cool tones in this red will make your teeth look whiter, giving you a real Hollywood smile.

"The National Union of Students has come under fire after it refused to condemn ISIS - because of fears it was 'Islamophobic'. Students put forward a motion at the body's National Executive Council meeting calling for the condemnation of terrorist atrocities and support for the Iraqi people. But the call was defeated after a rebellion led by Black Students Officer Malia Bouattia, who said the motion was merely a 'justification for war'. Scroll down for video . The National Union of Students has come under fire after it refused to condemn ISIS - because of fears it was 'Islamophobic'. Fighters from ISIS are pictured marching in Raqqa, Syria . It comes a day after military chiefs from around the globe met to discuss the battle against ISIS and despite a number of Muslim leaders in Britain having condemned the extremist group. One student, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'Islamophobia is a meaningless term used by irrational people when unable to rebut a rational criticism. 'Malia Bouattia should realise how lucky she is to be able to stand up and express her opinions with freedom and security. 'She would not enjoy the same freedom if she were to visit the ISIS/ISIL that she refuses to condemn, and protested her opinions.' Another added: 'I personally would find something rather Islamophobic in Ms Bouattia's idea that condemning ISIS is also to condemn the other, approximately two billion Muslims on the planet - who don't rape minorities or murder journalists. 'They don't want ISIS to carry out such attacks in the name of their religion, and who in the West have repeatedly begged not to be associated with the activities of ""Islamic"" State. 'If the vast majority of Muslim students in the UK are in fact repeatedly standing up and telling you that they don't like ISIS, that these terrorists don't represent their faith, that they don't want to be associated with them in any way - then how exactly is not condemning ISIS helping to fight Islamophobia?' The motion, proposed by Daniel Cooper, was raised at the National Union of Students' NEC meeting at Derbyshire House in London in September. It put forward seven suggestions as to how the body could support the ongoing battle with the Islamic State. The motion stated: 'To work with the International Students’ Campaign to support Iraqi, Syrian and other international students in the UK affected by this situation. 'To campaign in solidarity with the Iraqi people and in particular support the hard-pressed student, workers' and women's organisations against all the competing nationalist and religious-right forces. The National Union of Students (NUS) has come under fire after it refused to condemn ISIS - because of fears it was 'Islamophobic'. The NUS headquarters in London is pictured above . 'To support Iraqis trying to bridge the Sunni-Shia divide to fight for equality and democracy, including defence of the rights of the Christian and Yazidi-Kurd minorities. 'To condemn the IS and support the Kurdish forces fighting against it, while expressing no confidence or trust in the US military intervention. 'Encourage students to boycott anyone found to be funding the IS or supplying them with goods, training, travel or soldiers. 'To make contact with Iraqi and Kurdish organisations, in Iraq and in the UK, in order to build solidarity and to support refugees. and To issue a statement on the above basis.' But Birmingham student Malia Bouattia led a team who either abstained or voted against the proposal, leading to the motion's defeat. She said: 'We recognise that condemnation of ISIS appears to have become a justification for war and blatant Islamaphobia. 'This rhetoric exacerbates the issue at hand and in essence is a further attack on those we aim to defend. 'The NUS Black Students' Campaign stands in support of Black communities across the globe and uncompromisingly against imperialism and Western interference which history shows all too often leads to the suffering of Black people. 'We stand in complete solidarity with the Kurdish people against the recent attacks by ISIS and join many others in condemnation of their brutal actions. 'The NUS Black Students' Campaign will be working with Kurdish students and the International Students Campaign to raise this issue within the NUS.' She added that she will now begin work on a revised motion which will not be 'Islamophobic'. But Daniel Cooper, who proposed the motion, said he could not see any signs of Islamophobia. He said: 'I have looked again and again at the contents of the motion, yet I cannot track any Islamophobia or racism. 'There is a stranglehold of ""identity politics"" on the student movement. 'This is an issue which needs to be discussed in more depth, but essentially the idea is widespread that if a Liberation Officer opposes something, it must be bad.' Earlier this year Muslim leaders in Britain condemned ISIS expressing their 'grave concern' at continued violence in its name. Representatives from both the Sunni and Shia groups in the UK relayed their message that the militant group does not represent the majority of Muslims. Shuja Shafi, of the Muslim Council of Great Britain, said at the time: 'Violence has no place in religion, violence has no religion.' As international condemnation of the extremists continued to grow this week, US President Barack Obama met with representatives  from a global coalition of 22 countries to discuss the battle against ISIS. Representatives from Australia, Canada, Egypt, France, Iraq and Jordan were among those who attended the meeting. In a statement, the NUS said: 'At our most recent NEC meeting, a motion on this issue was presented and voted on by all members. 'Some committee members felt that the wording of the motion being presented would unfairly demonise all Muslims rather than solely the group of people it set out to rightfully condemn. 'NUS does not support ISIS and a new motion will be taken to the next NUS National Executive Committee meeting, which will specifically condemn the politics and methods of ISIS and offer solidarity for the Kurdish people.'","Student had put forward motion calling for condemnation of ISIS atrocities .

"Deputy headteacher Martin Goldberg, 46, hanged himself after being questioned over indecent images of children . A deputy headteacher's haul of 1,500 spycam photographs of young boys undressing was found when he hanged himself after being questioned over indecent images of children. Martin Goldberg, 46, was found hanged in the garage of his home in Shoeburyness, Essex, the day after he was quizzed by police over child pornography he purchased online, the inquest into his death heard. Officers later discovered hundreds of pictures of naked children on his computer, which had been secretly taken in changing rooms at Southend Leisure and Tennis Centre, the hearing at Chelmsford Coroner's Court was told. Police also believe he had been covertly filming children at the private £10,000-a-year Thorpe Hall School in  Southend, where he had worked for more than 20 years. The hearing yesterday was told that Goldberg had been spoken to by police on September 9 last year  following a tip-off from Canadian police about the online purchase of child pornography. The following day he had failed to arrive for work, prompting two members of staff to visit him at his £360,000 home - where they discovered his body. It was another 20 days before it was revealed he was under police investigation after officers found 1,500 indecent images of children, dating back as far as 2000, at his home. In many other cases, faces are not shown, or are out of focus, making it impossible to know the full tally of his victims. 'On September 9, he was spoken to as part of an investigation into alleged criminal offences of voyeurism,' coroner's officer Laura Howard told the inquest . 'On September 10 he was found in his detached single garage hanging. 'He had not turned up for work, when a colleague got no answer he contacted the police.' Goldberg had taught at independent Thorpe Hall School in Southend, Essex, for 20 years . Officers discovered hundreds of pictures of naked children on his computer, which had been secretly taken in changing rooms at Southend Leisure and Tennis Centre (pictured) The inquest heard toxicology tests were also carried out on Goldberg's body but 'nothing untoward' was found. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. Coroner Eleanor McGann ruled that Goldberg had intended to take his own life and recorded a verdict of suicide. 'This is enough to tell me he certainly may well have thought he had reason to die,' she said. 'I, therefore, am satisfied that he intended to die. Martin Goldberg took his own life.' Police investigating Goldberg's action say they believe he was acting alone and that there is no evidence to suggest his offending involved physical abuse. The inquest heard toxicology tests were also carried out on Goldberg's body but 'nothing untoward' was found. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death . Both the NSPCC and abuse charity Enough Abuse have said Thorpe Hall School was not to blame for failing to suspect Goldberg of any wrongdoing . Both the NSPCC and abuse charity Enough Abuse have said Thorpe Hall School was not to blame for failing to suspect Goldberg of any wrongdoing and has cleared the school of any safety breaches. Goldberg's boss, headteacher Andrew Hampton, said at the time details of the investigation were revealed that the privately-run school feels 'angry and betrayed' by Goldberg's secret voyeuristic double life. The case highlighted concerns over how long it took British police forces to act on intelligence passed to them about hundreds of suspected paedophiles by Canadian authorities as part of an international investigation dubbed Operation Spade. Goldbery was among 2,345 individuals suspected of having accessed child pornography whose names were handed to the UK’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) following a major inquiry in Canada. Officers found 1,500 indecent images of children, dating back as far as 2000, on Goldberg's computer - some which had been secretly taken at the leisure centre (pictured) Goldberg's body was found in the garage of his £360,000 home (pictured) by two of his colleagues . CEOP, which was later taken in to the National Crime Agency (NCA), received intelligence packages on 35 people, including Goldberg, from Canadian Police in July 2012. But CEOP failed to act on the information from Toronto Police – and it was only in November 2013 that Essex Police were told that Goldberg had been buying videos of naked boys from a vendor based in Canada. Essex Police then delayed their investigation into Goldberg for a further nine months, because they did not check his occupation, and did not realise he was a teacher. Officers did not warn the school where the IT expert regularly took children away on official trips. The force has apologised to parents for the delay, while Keith Bristow, director general of the NCA, has also apologised  in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee. The Independent Police Complaints . Commission (IPCC) is investigating how staff at CEOP handled the intelligence provided by Canadian police. The investigation will look at how CEOP . received the intelligence from Canadian police and how it was dealt . with. It will also consider why the referral to the IPCC took until . September 2014 rather than at the time delays were identified. The IPCC is separately investigating the actions of three police forces, Essex, North Yorkshire and North Wales in how they acted upon Project Spade intelligence sent to them by the NCA. Essex Police was alerted to concerns over Martin Goldberg as part of Operation Spade - a Canadian police operation which identified hundreds of suspected paedophiles. A total of 35 files were passed to the UK force as part of this operation. All information of criminal offences has now been acted on with two people being charged and 18 people still under investigation. MailOnline reported last November that hundreds of British suspected paedophiles had still not been arrested despite being identified by Canadian police 18 months earlier. Essex Police was alerted to concerns over Martin Goldberg as part of Operation Spade - a Canadian police operation which identified hundreds of suspected paedophiles . Canadian detectives said that in July 2012 they had sent police ‘hundreds of names’ of people who viewed ‘horrific’ child abuse videos distributed from Toronto by a crime ring. Globally, as of last November, 348 arrests had been made and 386 children rescued. Last year the Daily Mail revealed only one in 15 people caught viewing such images is arrested. Operation Spade started in 2010 and has worked with Interpol in more than 50 countries. More than 350,000 images and 9,000 videos of child sexual abuse have been found. One case is known to be that of children's doctor Myles Bradbury, who was jailed for 22 years in December after he admitted a string of sexual offences against cancer sufferers in his care aged as young as 11. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating how staff at the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), which is now part of the National Crime Agency (NCA), handled the intelligence provided by Canadian police. The investigation will look at how CEOP received the intelligence from Canadian police and how it was dealt with. It will also consider why the referral to the IPCC took until September 2014 rather than at the time delays were identified. IPCC Commissioner Carl Gumsley said last month: 'The public are rightly concerned about the safety of the most vulnerable members of society and issues concerning the protection of children. 'Independent IPCC investigators will be examining closely the actions taken by CEOP and NCA officers and staff over a sixteen month period to determine if they acted appropriately and promptly as well as looking at any possible organisational failings.'","Martin Goldberg, 46, found hanged in the garage of his Essex home .

"A woman from Kansas City is speaking out about an attack that nearly killed her. Marti Hill said wants others to know about what she had to go through, in the hope the knowledge may stop it happening to someone else. It was early one morning in September 2010 when a handyman came round to Ms Hill's house. She knew him from previous jobs in the past, but Brian Pennington claimed he wanted to show her a couple of things that needed finishing in the basement. Scroll down for video... Sharing her story: Marti Hill, who survived a brutal attack by her handyman is sharing her story publicly in hopes of empowering young women . Brutal: Marti eventually passed out as Pennington stabbed her multiple times and left her for dead . Long recovery: It would be 12 days before she would wake up in a hospital bed. She had trauma to her brain and lacerations to her throat . 'I'm kind of talking and I remember distinctively him not saying anything at all,' she said. 'We get to the bottom of the stairs, he grabs my throat and I'm just very taken, and I'm trying to look around and I can't turn, I can't look.' Pennington tried to strangle her. In jail: Brian Pennington is serving 28 years in prison . 'I kept saying, 'What are you doing? What are you doing?' and it came to a point where my voice just faded and I felt myself dropping and passed out,' Ms Hill said to KMBC. Police were called after she failed to show up for work. She was alive, but barely. Pennington had stabbed her in the neck. For a time it was not clear if she would live or die. Family kept a constant vigil at her hospital bedside. It was another 12 days before she was able to full wake up and inform police who had committed the brutal assault. Years on, Ms. Hill is still feeling the affects of that fateful morning and still hears an echo in her ear when she speaks. 'My ear feels very full. The side of my face feels like a mannequin, it's kind of numb and tingly all the way down the left side,' she said. Ms. Hill now speaks to small groups and tells them about the event the almost end  her life. He message to those who listen are for people to trust their instincts if something doesn't feel right. Unexplained  In September 2010, Pennington came to Hill's Prairie Village home and said he needed to fix a problem in her basement. He never did explain why he attacked Ms. Hill . Rescued: A co-worker alerted police when she didn't show up for work, which allowed her to get found quickly and saved her life . 'When someone's asked you to do something awkward like that, to walk to the basement, it's OK to say, 'No,' or, 'Come back,'' she said. 'Learning that, you know, we don't all think the same,' she said. 'I kind of thought we all just tried to be the best we could be and there are people that are not thinking that at all.' Pennington pleaded guilty and is serving 28 years in prison for attempted murder but has never once explain why he acted the way he did. Looking forward: Hill still wonders why he attacked her, but she knows she will never get an answer. Instead, she focuses on helping other women .","Marti Hill was nearly killed during a September 2010 assault .

"Hundreds of thousands of patients are still too afraid to speak out about poor NHS care, experts warned yesterday. They estimate that a quarter of a million incidents a year are never reported because patients and relatives think it will only make matters worse. Many are scared that it will have repercussions for their subsequent treatment while others fear the whole ordeal will just cause more ‘pain and grief'. Today a report commissioned by the Government is expected to warn that NHS staff who dare criticise standards of care are routinely being suspended or bullied out of their jobs. Scroll down for video . Robert Francis QC, pictured, sought evidence from hundreds of doctors, nurses and other employees . It has been chaired by Robert Francis, the barrister who oversaw an inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, who has sought evidence from hundreds of doctors, nurses and other employees. But Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of Healthwatch England, warned that the majority of patients who experience complain because they have no faith anything will be done. She also warned that more than half of patients who do raise grievances never get an apology from the staff responsible for the mistake. Giving evidence to MPs, Dr Rake, whose organisation champions’ patients’ rights, said: ‘Our research shows that only 40 per cent of people who have concern or complaint actually raise that concern or complaint to a member of the health service. ‘We estimate we lose quarter of a million complaints every year which is equates to a complaint one every two minutes because trust and confidence is so low. ‘People fear for repercussions on their care, particularly where it is very personal such as in GP services or a care setting.’ Dr Katherine Rake, pictured, said around 60 per cent of patients who suffered poor care refused to complain . Dr Rake, an academic in social policy who formerly advised the Government, also said that bereaved relatives were being made to wait three years for apologies over the deaths of their loved ones. She said that only this week she had been speaking to a woman whose mother had died from a broken hip sustained during a a fall at a care home. Dr Rake said the woman described the ordeal of trying to find out exactly what had happened ‘like a three year slog’ She added that staff were so defensive the woman felt like she was saying something ‘dirty or wrong.’ The figures are based on research by Healthwatch over the last two years including two polls covering 3,00 members of the public and detailed surveys of 400 patients. They consistently showed that around 60 per cent of patients who suffered poor care did not complain. Around 170,000 patients do bother to complain about the NHS every year so based on the assumption that two thirds do not report poor care, around 250 incidences are unreported. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised to transform the NHS’s handling of complaints in October 2013 following a damning review by MP Ann Clwyd, whose husband had died following poor care. But this evidence suggests very little has changed over the last year. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said making a complaint very often added to victims’ pain and grief. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured, has promised to change the way the NHS handles complaints . Also giving evidence to MPs on the Public Administration Committee, she added: ‘Patients and relatives tell us that complaints system bureaucratic complex confusing and v often adds to pain and grief already suffering . ‘Patients tell us its very time consuming and difficult to speak to person they need. ‘When people complain it takes very, very long time to get an outcome . ‘We certainly hear from patients who contact our national helpline about their fear of complaining in case their ongoing care will be compromised. ‘These are very often people who have been bereaved, who have been traumatised, and that whole episode has just compounded the grief for them.’","60% of patients who suffer poor NHS care do not make any complaint .

The form of dwarfism causes short stature and health problems, including the threat of brain aneurysms and a shortened life-span. As well as dealing with typical teenage challenges, Hannah also has to bravely face the reality of her condition. A new film follows Hannah as she prepares for graduation from high school, choosing a career, dreaming about boys and finding a date for her school prom. The bubbly teen, who weighs just over two stone, also spends her free time taking hip-hop and ballet classes and has her own voice coach.

'Growing up I always knew I was different from my brothers, Mark and Matt, and my sister, Kelly, who were average height.' However, Hannah says that she was never made to feel alienated as her loving family adapted their routine to suit her height. 'My mom and dad still made sure I had a normal childhood though. 'They lowered all the light switches and put stools in the bathroom and kitchen because I can't reach the counter and sinks.' The 19-year-old refuses to let her condition get in the way of her passion for dancing . One of Hannah's biggest dreams is to fall in love and to start a family . But she soon learned her normal teenage experiences were going to be different from those of her friends. She said: 'I go shopping with my friends but finding clothes that fit me is extremely difficult. 'I always have to get my clothes tailored or in a kids size - I can't buy high heeled shoes like my other friends.' Hannah says that her height can often prevent her being treated as an adult. 'Everyone thinks I'm five years old when they see me and it's frustrating because I'm not a baby.' Hannah says that she doesn't want her height to prevent her from having a normal and happy life and she has the same hopes and aspirations as any other girl her age.

But despite the limitations posed by her condition, Hannah has never let it get in the way of her real passion, dancing. Hannah, who has been dancing since she was a toddler, says she finds it relaxing and acts as a release from her condition. 'I've been dancing since I was two years old, and took gymnastics at three.

"Notorious 'serial stowaway' Marilyn Jean Hartman has struck again. The 63-year-old California resident was arrested Monday in Jacksonville, Florida, after she allegedly snuck onto a flight from Minneapolis Sunday by using someone else's identity. Once in Jacksonville, the woman allegedly used a fake name, Maria Sandgren, to get transportation to Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort, where she checked into a $300-a-night villa. But her triumph was short-lived: Hartman fled hours later when the real guest showed up at the hotel. She's baaack! Notorious 'serial stowaway' Marilyn Jean Hartman, 63, was arrested in Florida after allegedly sneaking onto a flight and then checking into a posh resort using someone else's name . The fleet-footed senior citizen was discovered by security guards the following day hiding in a vacant room that was been renovated, reported NBC News. Hartman has been charged with felony fraud, defrauding an innkeeper and misdemeanor trespassing. She is due back in court Tuesday. The stowaway's long criminal record lists numerous similar incidents involving boarding flights without a ticket and entering places under false pretense. In August 2014 alone she was arrested no fewer than three times. Hartman has blamed her penchant for sneaking onto planes on an unrecognized medical condition she called 'whistleblower trauma syndrome. According to the woman, she was a whistleblower who was forced by the FBI to flee her home, forcing her to live on the streets. Police picked her up at Sky Harbor International Airport August 26 on suspicion of criminal trespass after officials noticed her loitering near the baggage claim. Repeat offender: In August 2014, Hartman was arrested no fewer than three times, including at Phoenix airport . Just two weeks earlier, Hartman was ordered to spend 117 days in jail 13 for a probation violation after she was spotted at Los Angeles International Airport when a court had banned from the premises just days earlier. However Hartman - who is said to have a 'fixation' on airports because they make her feel safe - was released Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood on August 16 - just three days later -  due to overcrowding. It is unclear how she made it from L.A. to Phoenix in the last 10 days. After her August arrest in Phoenix, the 63-year-old wondered aloud at a press conference, 'Why has the government allowed me to get past security points?' Hartman, who has made previous attempts . to sneak aboard flights at other airports, was arrested August 4 after successfully taking a Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles without a . ticket. At Mineta San Jose International Airport, Hartman tried at least three times to get to a plane before she finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's documents, law enforcement officials said. She later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft and was sentenced to two years of probation. Her boarding status was discovered once the Southwest flight landed in Los Angeles, the officials said. Hartman later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft. A judge ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a valid ticket. Outside . the courthouse after sentencing, Hartman said she would never try to sneak . onto a plane again. 'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to . repeat,' she said. She added, 'Obviously they'll be on watch for me so I wouldn't dare attempt this again. I don't want to be that position. I want to go with a paid ticket,' reported News4Jax at the time. However, . Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said he had a feeling . the woman 'with a fixation on flying' would return to LAX, so police . passed out fliers with her picture. Can't stop: Hartman was sentenced to 18 months probation for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights last year. She spent three days in jail . 'She was (then) seen wandering through several terminals in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said. In February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights at San Francisco International Airport on three separate days. Her breach of security at the San Jose airport caused federal officials and the airline to launch investigations. It also prompted criticism of the airport in light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived an arduous journey to Maui. Hartman, who authorities say has a history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's been caught after successfully boarding a flight. She said last week that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the streets. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said that Hartman has no family and has never married. According to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the last few years. Records indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant. Plane fixation: Hartman tried at least three times to breach airport security before she was able to get through a checkpoint without a boarding pass at Mineta San Jose International Airport  August 4 . According to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later released without charge. In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month. 'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said. 'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.' Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt. On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix. She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.","Marilyn Jean Hartman, 63, arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, on charges of fraud and trespassing .

Filthy: These images show the disgusting squalor of a pensioner's flat where 31 cats were kept in such appalling conditions that many were seriously ill with cat flu . Carol Sheridan, 67, kept the animals in filthy conditions in her flat in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, including having no electricity or running hot water . One cat even had an eye condition because of the illness. Images released by the RSPCA show the horrific conditions in the flat, which had no electricity or running hot water. All the animals were taken into care by the RSPCA after they were found, but it was said to have cost the charity thousands of pounds to give them the appropriate treatment. The pensioner, who lived alone in the £90,000 home, has now been banned from keeping any animal as a pet for five years. She was taken to court by the RSPCA after a raid on her home, which discovered  the sick animals . A total of 16 pets were said to be suffering from the respiratory disease, but had not been taken to the vet . The RSPCA has since spent thousands of pounds caring for and re-homing the animals . There are still believed to be five cats in the pensioner's home. One cat (right) even had an eye condition because of the flu . Sheridan (pictured) was found guilty at trial of two charges under the Animal Welfare Act . She initially denied two charges under the Animal Welfare Act but was found guilty by a district judge after a trial at Manchester Magistrates' Court. Sheridan, who is in receipt of benefits, was ordered to surrender ownership of the cats, along with five others still thought to be at the address. She was also sentenced to a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work and must also pay £330 costs. David McCormick, prosecuting, said it has cost the RSPCA thousands of pounds to look after and care for the cats after they were removed. Some already have new homes, and others are in the process of being rehomed, he added. Mr McCormick said: 'It would be in the defendant's own best interests if a ban was imposed. Fourteen of the cats are still in the society's protection.' The court heard Sheridan was an 'animal lover' who started caring for other people's cats, but had soon become 'overwhelmed' with the number. The court Sheridan has no previous convictions and does some charity work. John Mitchell, defending, said: 'She is a lady aside from this of previous good character. Sheridan, who is in receipt of benefits, must also surrender ownership of the cats, along with five others still thought to be at her flat (pictured) 'This is a lady who is an animal lover. She tells me that her animals are her life.' District Judge Mark Hadfield said he accepted that Sheridan had the best interests of the cats at heart but that the number involved had 'overwhelmed her'. He said the house had no electricity or hot running water and added: 'It was clearly filthy. The conditions in your home were appalling, even for you.' Speaking after the case, a RSPCA spokesman urged anyone with an ill pet to seek immediate veterinary care or contact the charity.","Carol Sheridan, 67, kept the animals in 'extremely unsuitable' conditions .

"Charles Manson's fiancée allegedly tricked him into agreeing to marry her as part of a bizarre plot to put his corpse on display after he died. Afton Elaine Burton, who calls herself 'Star', took out a marriage license with the serial killer last year - but reportedly only suggested matrimony to get legal ownership of his remains and stuff them in a glass coffin. Star, 27, strung the 80-year-old murderer along with the hope of cashing in after he died and turning his body into a tourist attraction, according to a source close to Manson. She had already tried to get the rights to his remains without marrying him, but was turned down, according to the New York Post. The paper claimed that Star offered herself up as a his bride after being rebuffed, because Californian law allows spouses to choose what happens to their husbands' and wives' bodies after they die. The claims come from Daniel Simone, a journalist who has spoken extensively with Manson and is planning to write a book on him. He claimed that Manson is now wise to the plot - and thinks it is ridiculous because he believes that he's immortal. Simone told the Post: 'He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool.' 'He feels he will never die... Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with.' Simone also said that Manson never had any intention of marrying Star - but he kept up the pretense because they would bring presents to his prison cell in Corcoran, California. The prospect of Star becoming Mrs Manson diminished this week after it emerged the couple's 90-day marriage license had expired. Killer: Manson is pictured left during his trial in March, 1971, and of right in a mugshot taken on March 18, 2009 at California State Prison, Corcoran . Prison rules mean the two could only marry during visiting hours on a weekend - and last weekend was their final shot before the license expired on 5 February. Simone said that Manson has been unable to receive visitors lately because he is being treated for an infection. In a statement, Star has said she an Manson will still marry - but that an 'interruption in logistics' got in the way. Manson has been in prison for more than four decades after being put away for a series of murders in 1969 killings. His victims included the brutal murder of director Roman Polanski's actress wife, Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant. Star insisted last year that she and Manson were madly in love and already consider themselves married. 'I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say,' she told CNN in August of the now gray-haired killer, who has a swastika tattooed on his forehead. She said she had been following Manson's 'philosophy' since she was a teenager and moved to Corcoran, where the convicted murderer is detained, to be closer to him. Manson was married twice before he was jailed, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958, and later to Candy Stevens between 1959 and 1963. He was sentenced to death in 1969 along with four of his disciples for having led the killing of seven people, but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison. Manson applied for parole in 2012 but was denied release and is not eligible to apply again until 2027. Manson headed an apocalyptic cult that committed murders in upscale, mostly white neighborhoods of Los Angeles in order to blame the crimes on African Americans, in the hope of sparking what he termed a 'Helter Skelter' race war.","Afton Eliane Burton, 26, took out marriage license with 80-year-old killer .

"An execution date has been set for Georgia's only female death row inmate - the first time in seven decades that a woman will be executed in the state. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, who was convicted of killing her husband in February 1997, is scheduled to be executed on a date between February 25 and March 4, the attorney general's office announced yesterday. The 46-year-old was sentenced to death in November 1998 after she was found guilty for persuading her boyfriend to kill her husband, Douglas Gissendaner. Kelly Renee Gissendaner (above), 46,  who was convicted of killing her husband in February 1997, is scheduled to be executed on a date between February 25 and March 4 . Gissendaner, who is incarcerated at Arrendale State Prison, is the only woman of 84 inmates facing the death penalty in the state, figures showed from a report by Georgia's Department of Corrections last year. She is set to be the 14th woman executed in Georgia since 1735, according to the AJC. In 1997, she was convicted of having her husband killed by her boyfriend Gregory Bruce Owen, her co-defendant who she was having an affair with at the time. She told his sister she was planning to separate from her husband, according to prosecutors. Owen suggested that Gissendaner divorce her husband, but she instead said to kill him because she did not expect Douglas to leave her alone after they were separated. Gissendaner's boyfriend followed her orders to kill Douglas while she was out at a nightclub with friends. Owen kidnapped Douglas, drove him to a remote area, and killed him by stabbing him in the neck and back repeatedly and beat him with a nightstick. Douglas's car was also burned with kerosene, according to 11Alive. They also stole his watch and wedding ring to make robbery look like the motive in his death. She is Georgia's only female death row inmate and will be the first woman in seven decades to be put to death . Kelly Gissendaner was sentenced to death in November 1998 after she was found guilty for persuading her boyfriend, Gregory Bruce Owen, to kill her husband, Douglas Gissendaner (above). Douglas was kidnapped, stabbed repeatedly and beat before his car was set on fire with kerosene . Owen was sentenced to life in prison, instead of facing the death penalty, after he testified against Gissendaner. In the state of Georgia, the last time a woman was executed occurred in 1945. Lena Baker was electrocuted in March of that year after she was convicted of murder  for shooting her boss. In 2005, the state pardoned her after agreeing with her family that she acted in self defense. Under Georgia law, only three offenses are punishable by death - murder, rape and kidnapping.

"Richard Gatiss, 25, has been accused of assaulting disabled pensioner Alan Barnes on January 25 . This is the first picture of the 25-year-old alleged mugger who has appeared in court, accused of assaulting disabled pensioner Alan Barnes. Richard Gatiss, from Gateshead, appeared in court this morning charged with assaulting him with intent to rob. Frail Mr Barnes, 67, was pushing his bin outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, on January 25, when he was allegedly knocked to the ground, breaking his collar bone as he landed. It sparked an internet campaign which raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for Mr Barnes. During the first hearing of the case at Gateshead Magistrates' Court today, Gatiss spoke only to confirm his name and age. The defendant was remanded in custody until his next appearance at Newcastle Crown Court on February 24. Following the alleged assault, 21-year-old beautician Katie Cutler set up an online fund which generated £330,135 for Mr Barnes and the pair have since become friends. The disabled pensioner, who  has suffered from sight and growth problems since birth, said he was overwhelmed by the response from well-wishers across the globe. 'I am totally overwhelmed and incredibly grateful to Katie for what she has done for me,' he said. 'The youth of today don't always get portrayed in a positive light, but I won't ever forget what this young woman has done for me. This is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

"The explanations given by NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams about how he came to falsely claim the helicopter he was travelling in Iraq was shot down have emerged in a full transcript. Williams has temporarily stepped down from his position at the broadcaster after the inaccuracies of his reports from Iraq were revealed, casting doubt on his other accounts - including his reporting of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina which earned him such acclaim. In an interview with Stars and Stripes magazine Williams said he made a mistake about being in a Chinook helicopter that was shot down in 2003 because he was scared and in a warzone for the first time. Scroll down for video . NBC Nightly News Anchor Brian Williams revealed he incorrectly assumed a helicopter he was travelling in had been shot down after it was part of a convoy that made an unscheduled landing in Iraq in 2003 . He said: 'Because I knew we had all come under fire, I guess I had assumed that all of the airframes took some damage because we all went down.' Williams, 55, had claimed in numerous interviews that he survived the helicopter he was in being shot down by a rocket propelled grenade in 2003. In the most extreme version of the tale, told to David Letterman in March 2013, he said: 'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.' In fact it was another craft entirely that had been attacked and his inaccuracies were revealed after people in the shot down helicopter challenged his account on Facebook. Some have claimed the helicopter Williams was in was an entire hour behind the shot down craft. The new anchor said he had been scared and because his helicopter made an unscheduled landing he mistakenly assumed they had also suffered a hit. He added: 'I did what a civilian, an untrained civilian, would do in that instance and it was being scared. I think anyone in my shoes would admit that. It could not have been a more foreign environment. All we knew is we had been fired upon. All we knew was we had set down and then with the arrival of the sandstorm, how do we defend our little desert bivouac area.' Williams is Managing Editor of the United States' most watched network news program and announced last week he would be temporarily taking himself off the program because he had become 'too much a part of the news.' He apologised live on air on Wednesday for his inaccurate reporting.  He said: 'I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago,' he said. 'I want to apologise. I said I was travelling in an aircraft that was hit by RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] fire. I was instead in a following aircraft.' Williams reported from Iraq (left) and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina (right) but concerns have been raised about the accuracy of his reports after it emerged some of them had been embellished . Brian Williams has announced he is temporarily stepping down from his job as anchor at NBC Nightly News . He said his mind became a 'fog' while he was in the Chinook helicopter in Iraq and asked people to remember he was not a military professional dealing with the situation. Williams said he hoped the attention his inaccuracies have attracted did not reflect negatively on soldiers and veterans involved. He said: 'Anything that ends up not honoring the veterans is a failure on my part. This is about honoring the people I saw over there. As I've said a million times publicly, [they are] the best team we've ever fielded.' New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd previously claimed that news bosses were told last year his claims sometimes did not stack up, and that his tendency to exaggerate had become 'a joke' among NBC staffers. The scandal led to Williams cancelling an appearance on the David Letterman show last week. NBC has launched an official probe into Williams, lead by Richard Esposito, its top investigative journalist. Lester Holt will temporarily take over his role. Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face.’ Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army Chinook during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on air apology. ‘Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor,’ he wrote on Facebook. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the floodwaters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were there. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled ‘Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.’ In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away. Boston, 2006 . A navy vet has accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Brian Williams forced to apologise after inaccurate reports were exposed .

"A newborn girl in China was born seemingly ‘pregnant’ with twins, due to an extremely rare condition. Doctors said the girl may have condition known as ‘fetus in fetu’ – which is so rare it affects less than 1 in 500,000 births, and there are only 200 reports of it ever happening. It is a developmental abnormality where two identical twins develop in the womb, but one dies, and its undeveloped fetus is absorbed into the remaining twin’s body. A newborn girl in China was born with two growths in her stomach. Scans showed the masses had all the characteristics of 10-week old fetuses. Pictured is a scan with arrows showing the spine of each fetus . Doctors operated to remove the growths from the baby girl's stomach when she was three weeks old. Pictured is a a fairly well developed fetus lying on its back, with rudimentary digits (file photo) However, the doctors reporting the case said this was a controversial diagnosis and it could be the baby girl was suffering from a type of cancer in which the tumour is well-developed and appears like a fetus. The case, reported in the Hong Kong Medical Journal, describes a baby girl was born with two masses in her abdominal area who was being treated in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, in November 2010. This baffled doctors, as the baby had no evidence of a blockage in her intestine and fed normally after birth. They believed they might be tumours, and carried out an ultrasound which revealed there were two masses with a total diameter of 47mm between the baby girl’s spleen and the left kidney. They discovered the ‘tumours’ were, in fact, two 8 to 10 week-old fetuses. Each had umbilical cords, limbs, skin, rib cages, brain tissue, spines, intestines, genitalia of ambiguous gender and other parts common in 10-week-old fetuses. They removed the fetuses in an operation when she was three weeks old, and found they were 37mm and 35mm in length. The larger fetus weighed 14.2g while the smaller weighed 9.3g. Fetus in fetu is an incredibly rare condition that affects only one in five million live births. It is a condition where the malformed fetus is found in the body of its twin. The fetus is found in the abdomen in 80 per cent of cases, although there have been reports of it occurring in the skull. There are only 200 reports of it ever happening. While the diagnosis is gaining popularity, the World Health Organisation has classified ‘fetus in fetu’ as a variant of mature teratoma, a type of cancer where the tumour is well-developed. The World Health Organisation has classified ‘fetus in fetu’ as a variant of mature teratoma, a type of cancer where the tumour is well-developed. There is another theory, known as the theory of ‘monozygotic diamniotic twins’. This proposes that identical twins formed from the same egg started developing in the womb. The theory says one of the developing twins died, and its undeveloped remains is absorbed into the other twin’s body. Writing in the case report, the doctors said: ‘The theory of demised multiple pregnancy has gained much support recently. ‘Despite the gaining popularity, there is, as yet no concrete evidence to confirm this relationship. ‘Our case report does not support the popular monozygotic multiple pregnancy theory, and favours, by default, the traditional classification into a teratoma.’ Most of the cases of fetus in fetu are discovered in infancy, although in one case, farmer from India only discovered he was suffering from the  condition when he was 36 years old and it looked like he was pregnant, Starcasm reports.

She was diagnosed with fetus in fetu, and the large mass was revealed to be part of an identical twin that had failed to develop and had been enveloped into the body of its sister. Further investigation found it consisted of a breast and an arm which included a shoulder blade and two fingers. In 2009, MailOnline also reported on the case of a one-year-old girls who survived surgery to remove her unborn twin’s fetus from her swollen stomach. Kang Mengru's adoptive parents were shocked when within months after her birth, her stomach began to swell and superstitious neighbours began calling the little girl a 'monster' and gossiping that she was pregnant.

"'Strong, concrete suspicions': UN investigator Carla del Ponte says there are indications that chemical weapons attacks were carried out by Syrian rebels . A senior United Nations official has claimed that Syrian rebels may have used chemical weapons against government forces. Carla Del Ponte said evidence from casualties and medical staff indicated that rebel forces in the civil war had used the deadly nerve agent sarin. ‘Our investigators have been in neighbouring countries interviewing victims, doctors and field hospitals, and there are strong, concrete suspicions, but not yet incontrovertible proof, of the use of sarin gas,’ said Del Ponte in an interview with Swiss-Italian television. ‘This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities.’ Last night, the UN commission looking into allegations of war crimes in Syria tried to row back on the comments by its human rights investigator, pointing out that conclusive evidence had not been discovered. However, the White House said it was likely that President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, not the rebels, were behind any chemical weapons use. Syrian government forces and the rebels have already accused each other of carrying out three attacks with chemical weapons. Sarin has been classed as a weapon of mass destruction due to its potency and is banned under international law. US President Barack Obama has said that the use or deployment of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a ‘red line’ that could lead to foreign military intervention. Following two Israeli air strikes on military bases in the Syrian capital Damascus over the weekend, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said: ‘We are seriously concerned by the signs of preparation for possible armed intervention in Syria.’ As a long-standing Syrian ally, Russia has protected President Assad by blocking Western efforts in the UN Security Council to push him from power. Israeli officials claim the air strikes were to ensure Lebanon’s Hezbollah did not receive a shipment of hi-tech missiles that could threaten Israel. The comments by Ms Del Ponte, a member of the U.N. panel probing alleged war crimes in Syria, contradict claims by Britain and the U.S. that intelligence reports showed Syrian soldiers had used chemical weapons. She said that the United Nations independent commission of inquiry on Syria has not yet seen evidence of government forces having used chemical weapons, which are banned under international law. 'Our investigators have been in neighbouring countries interviewing victims, doctors and field hospitals and, according to their report of last week which I have seen, there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas, from the way the victims were treated,' said Ms Del Ponte. The odourless, colourless nerve agent prevents the proper operation of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, the nervous system's 'off switch' for glands and muscles. Without this enzyme muscles are continually stimulated leading to convulsions, paralysis, unconsciousness and eventually respiratory failure leading to death. Ms Del Ponte, a former Swiss attorney-general who also served as prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, gave no details as to when or where sarin may have been used. Assad's government and the rebels accuse each another of carrying out three chemical weapon attacks, one near Aleppo and another near Damascus, both in March, and another in Homs in December. Horrific: Experts have said that the injuries shown in the video, which emerged last month, are consistent with those sustained after a chemical weapon attack . Graphic: The video was posted on the Facebook page of British-trained doctor Niazi Habash, who treated some of the victims of the strike, which was said to have hit the northern city of Aleppo . Victim: A woman is treated for what appears to be breathing difficulties at a clinic in the north of Aleppo. Rebels blamed government forces for the attack, but a UN Commission suspects they carried it out themselves . Meanwhile fighting continued to rage in Syria, where rebels claimed to have killed eight government troops after shooting down their helicopter in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour, along Syria's border with Iraq. The Coventry-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights posted footage online showing several armed men standing in front of the wreckage. As one of the fighters in the video speaks, the camera pans to a pick-up truck piled with bodies. The fighter is then heard saying that all of Assad's troops who were on board the helicopter were killed as it crashed. He says Islamic fighters of the Abu Bakr Saddiq brigade brought down the helicopter as it was taking off from a nearby air base in the provincial capital. The Observatory, which claims to get its information via a network of activists on the ground, said eight troops were killed in the incident yesterday. Downed: In this image taken from a video obtained from the Shaam News Network, armed men stand near the wreckage of a military helicopter, left, in Deir el-Zour, which was said to have contained eight regime soldiers . Narrative: The soldier speaking in the video says Islamic fighters of the Abu Bakr Saddiq brigade brought down the helicopter as it was taking off from a nearby air base in the provincial capital . Rebels also yesterday occupied parts of the Mannagh military air base after weeks of fighting with government troops who have for months been defending the sprawling facility near the border with Turkey. Assad's warplanes were pounding rebel positions inside the base on today as battles between rebels and government forces raged on, the Observatory said, adding there was an unknown number of casualties on both sides. The rebels moved deep into the air base yesterday despite fire from government warplanes, capturing a tank unit inside and killing the base commander, claimed the Aleppo Media Centre, another activist group. The fighting comes a day after Israeli warplanes struck areas in and around the capital, Damascus, setting off a series of explosions as they targeted a shipment of guided missiles believed to be bound for Hezbollah. The airstrike, the second in three days and the third this year, signalled a sharp escalation of Israel's involvement in Syria's civil war. Aftermath: Bulldozers work to remove rubble after the Israeli airstrike in the Al-Hama area near Damascus which Israeli military authorities said targeted a shipment of guided missiles believed to be bound for Hezbollah . Destruction: The damage left at a chicken farm building following the attack. The airstrike, the second in three days and the third this year, signalled a sharp escalation of Israel's involvement in Syria's civil war . Syrian state media reported that Israeli missiles hit a military and scientific research centre near Damascus and caused casualties. The reports did not specify the number or say if the casualties were civilians or troops. The state-run Sana news agency made no mention of the fighting inside the Mannagh air base. But it reported that government troops today regained control of villages along the highway linking the northern city of Aleppo to its civilian airport, the country's second largest. Syrian 'armed forces restored security and stability to (six) villages' south of the city and along the airport highway, Sana said, calling it a 'major strategic victory in the north'. Much of the north has been in opposition hands since rebels launched an offensive in the area last summer, seizing army bases, large swathes of land along the border with Turkey and whole neighbourhoods inside Aleppo. The Syrian conflict started in 2011 with protests against Assad's regime, but eventually turned into a civil war that according to UN estimates has so far killed more than 70,000 people. More than one million Syrians have fled their homes during the fighting and sought shelter in neighbouring countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Millions of others have been displaced inside the country.","Carla Del Ponte said UN Commission investigating war crimes in Syria has 'strong, concrete suspicions' that rebels used chemical weapons .

"The warning at railway stations always like to remind us to ‘Mind the Gap’ when stepping on or getting off a train. But perhaps it should also add the words ‘particularly if you’re wearing high heels’, according to research. An analysis by Network Rail has shown that women in killer heels are particularly in danger of suffering an accident - sometimes fatal - when boarding or getting off a train. Drinking alcohol beforehand, being in a hurry, carrying luggage or paying more attention to a smart-phone or tablet are the other main risk factors. Figures show women with luggage and those who have been drinking should take the most care when boarding or getting off a train. File photo .

The report says 9 per cent of all platform incidents involve ‘intoxication’, noting: ‘More men are involved in alcohol related incidents than women.’ But overall women account for 65per cent of accidents alighting or boarding trains. The report said: ‘Footwear could be one reason for this difference. It is also possible that females are more likely to report this type of incident.’ Women aged 50-71 experience the highest proportion of accidents. One in seven platform accidents involve people struggling with luggage, carrying suitcases, pushchairs, bikes or other baggage. One in seven platform accidents involve people struggling with luggage,  pushchairs, bikes or other baggage . The report also says that getting off the train ‘is more hazardous than boarding’, while summer sees the highest proportion of incident despite having lower passenger numbers. In the five years between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2014 there were 6,969 reported incidents of slips trips and falls at the point where passengers alight or board trains. This has increased from 1259 in 2009/10 to 1490 in 2013/14 – an 18 per cent rise. Clapham Junction in South London has had the highest number of platform incidents (40) followed by St Pancras International (29), East Croydon (28), London Victoria (23) London Paddington (22) and London Bridge (22). Clapham Junction, pictured, in South London has had the highest number of platform incidents . After that comes Birmingham New Street (21), Glasgow Central (19), London Waterloo (18) and Stratford East London (16). A public awareness campaign has been launched in stations across Britain called ‘Lend a Helping Hand’. Featuring various pairs of upended feet and legs, it uses cartoons and quirky verse to encourage people to be more considerate of their fellow passengers. One aimed at drinkers and showing a bottle says: ’If your friends have had a little tipple or had a little fun, Look after them like a good chum.’ Another notes: ’Prams and cases have minds of their own. Oh how they love to speed off alone.’ A third aimed at smart-phone users notes: ‘A clever clogs is never clever when glued to the phone. . So keep those eyes peeled for risks that are shown.’ The report notes: ‘The gap between the train and the platform is designed to be practical. It must both be large enough to provide sufficient space for a variety of different train types to run safely and practicably without creating a physical obstruction but also be small enough to allow people to get on and off quickly and safely. ‘The gap cannot be closed nor can it ever be exactly the same at all Britain’s 2,500 stations, as they were built at different times by different historic railway companies. ‘ .","Network Rail analysis shows women in killer heels are most  in danger .

"Actor Zach Braff has apologized after a tweet he sent on Sunday night comparing Pharrell’s bellboy outfit at the Grammys to the flying monkey in The Wizard of Oz got him into trouble . Scrubs actor Zach Braff has apologized after a tweet he sent on Sunday night comparing Pharrell’s bellboy outfit at the Grammys to the flying monkey in The Wizard of Oz got him into trouble. For the performance of his award-winning song Happy, singer/producer Pharrell wore a bellboy-type hat and jacket that provoked much online debate. While many viewers tweeted about Pharrell’s likeness to the bellhop in the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel, others wondered if – given his political-charged performance – the outfit was a reference to black bellhops. Braff joined the online debate when he jokingly shared a side-by-side picture of Pharrell and the flying monkey from the 2013 The Wizard of Oz-remake – Oz The Great and Powerful. 'Grammys are time-delayed in LA (?!) but someone just sent me this: #IWoreItBetter,’ he tweeted. His post sparked much intense debate online and he was called out for not realizing that comparing African Americans to monkeys could be construed as an offensive racial slur. On Monday Braff posted an apology, claiming that his reference was inspired by his voiceover role as a monkey in Oz. 'I love Pharrell. I thought the outfit he wore was similar to that of my bell hop in Oz. I apologize,’ he tweeted. Braff's post sparked much intense debate online and he was called out for not realizing that comparing African Americans to monkeys could be construed as an offensive racial slur . Pharrell took home two Grammys - Best Solo Performance and Best Video - for his song Happy on the night. His performance during the award show also provoked a reaction as it included dancers in black hoodies who struck a 'hands up, don't shoot' pose - a reference to the slogan used by protesters after the Michael Brown shooting. The gesture is the same  that has recently been used by demonstrators protesting the death of other unarmed black men at the hands of police - including Eric Garner in New York City. The use of hoods was a reference to the death of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012. Symbolic: This is the moment Pharrell Williams and his hooded backing dancers made a 'hands up' gesture in the middle of their Grammy performance. However the 'hands up'' refers to Michael Brown, who was gunned down by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, last year. Some accounts of the deadly incident claimed the unarmed black teenager had his hands up when the cop shot him. A movement which followed adopted the slogan 'Black Lives Matter' and has been used by various celebrities during high profile events and awards ceremonies. Prince was one of the stars who used the phrase during the ceremony. Before presenting the award for best album, he said: 'Albums... remember those? Albums still matter. Like books and black lives, albums still matter.' Successful evening: Williams won Best Solo Performance and Best Music Video for Happy while Prince said: 'Albums... remember those? Albums still matter. Like books and black lives, albums still matter'","Actor Zach Braff has apologized after a tweet he sent on Sunday night comparing Pharrell at the Grammys to the flying monkey in The Wizard of Oz .

Schwichtenberg was the mobile home park's manager since 2002 and was dating Mrs. Brady according to the Wisconsin State Journal. 'Chris went to the door and from what I understand the kid just started shooting,' said Schwichtenberg's mother, Joyce Zimdars. 'He was my only son,' Zimdars added. 'Everybody around here loved him. He did everything he could for everybody, just like his father.' Sutcliffe, both Brady girls and the two boys all attended Wisconsin Heights High School. Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney says deputies have had contact with Sutcliffe in the past, mostly over family matters, and that they will be charging the young man with two counts of first degree intentional homicide. He will appear in court on Thursday.","Dean M. Sutcliffe, of Mazomanie, Wisconsin, has been charged with  the deaths of  Ariyl Brady, 16, and and Chris Schwichtenberg, 39 .

"Experts have long pondered why the skull of a martyr on display in an Italian cathedral is marked with 16 perfectly round holes. Now scientists have revealed that the drilling of the skull took place after the man was beheaded by 15th century Ottoman Turk invaders. It is thought that 'bone powder' was harvested in order to treat paralysis, epilepsy and strokes, believed to be caused by demonic influences in the early 18th century. A holey skull (shown) displayed in an Italian Cathedral has 16 circular marks from drills because skull powder was collected and used to treat paralysis, epilepsy and stroke in the early 18th century, claims experts . The skull belongs to one of 800 ‘martyrs of Otranto’ who were executed on August 14, 1480 near the town of Otranto in Apulia, Italy. They were beheaded when they refused to give up their Christian faith, Discovery reported. The massacre followed a 15-day siege, where all men over the age of 50 were killed and the women and children either murdered or sold into slavery. The skull (left) belongs to one of 800 ‘martyrs of Otranto’ who were executed on 14 August 1480 and has eight holes and eight partial perforations. By studying the cupped shape of the circular marks, experts deduced that powder was collected with a trepan and rounded drill bit (examples shown right) French chemist Nicolas Lémery, who lived at the turn of the 17th century, wrote that added to water, powdered skull can treat paralysis, stroke, epilepsy and ‘other illness of the brain’. ‘The skull of a person who died of violent and sudden death is better than that of a man who died of a long illness or who had been taken from a cemetery: the formers has held almost all of his spirits, which in the latter they have been consumed, either by illness or by the earth,’ he wrote in in his book, Pharmacopée universelle. The martyrs, whose bones are displayed at the Cathedral of Otranto, were beatified by Pope Francis on 12 May 2013 and are now the patron saints of the city. But, one of the skulls was set apart from the rest because it featured rounded holes that had been deliberately drilled into it. The reason for the drilling had perplexed researchers for years. Gino Fornaciari, professor of history of medicine and paleopathology at the University of Pisa, Italy, noted the holes are a regular round shape. Exactly half of them are a conical shape and the rest are partial perforations, according to the Journal of Ethnopharmacology. Professor Fornaciari said: ‘The perfectly cupped shape of the incomplete perforations leads to hypothesise the use of a particular type of trepan, with semi-lunar shaped blade or rounded bit; a tool of this type could not produce bone discs, but only bone powder.’ A trepan or trephine is a surgical instrument used up to drill a burr hole into the skull in order to expose the tissue for medical reasons. The beheaded martyrs, whose bones are displayed at the Cathedral of Otranto (pictured), were beatified by Pope Francis on 12 May 2013 and are now the patron saints of the town . Skull powder was used in the 18th century to treat paralysis, stroke, epilepsy and ‘other illness of the brain’. A jar marked 'cranium' is shown . Bone dust harvested from the skulls of saints or martyrs who died violent deaths was thought to be an effective treatment for a variety of conditions. Valentina Giuffra, also from the University of Pisa, said that the ingredient was chosen because the head was the most important part of the body and invisible spiritual forces remained active even after death. French chemist Nicolas Lémery, who lived at the turn of the 17th century, wrote that when added to water, powdered skull can treat paralysis, stroke, epilepsy and ‘other illness of the brain’. ‘The skull of a person who died of violent and sudden death is better than that of a man who died of a long illness or who had been taken from a cemetery: the formers has held almost all of his spirits, which in the latter they have been consumed, either by illness or by the earth,’ according to his book, Pharmacopée universelle. Drills were likely used to collect the powder before the bones were arranged in the glass cabinet in 1711, although no-one knows why the particular skull was singled out. The skull is the only evidence to support historical accounts that the macabre ingredient was used in medicine. The skull belongs to one of 800 ‘martyrs of Otranto’ who were executed on August 14, 1480 near the town of Otranto in Apulia, Italy. The cathedral, where their remains are displayed, is marked on this map . The martyrs were beatified by Pope Francis on 12 May 2013 and are now the patron saints of the city, whose cathedral is pictured above .","Skull belongs to a man who was beheaded by 15th century Ottoman Turks .

"As a teenager Lauren Hill had always been short for her age. For the gymnast her growth spurt came later in life, when last year, as a 15-year-old she suddenly shot up six inches in just two months. But with it came a devastating blow to her dreams of competing on the world stage. Lauren was diagnosed with scoliosis - an abnormal curvature of the spine. Her mother, Alison, said experts revealed the condition had been caused by her daughter's rapid growth, leaving her spine bent at 45 degrees and resembling the shape of a 'c'. The teenager faced the heartbreaking reality of having to give up the sport she had loved since the age of two. But today Lauren is back in training, preparing for the World Championships in China next year after experts helped straighten out her back with daily physiotherapy sessions. Scroll down for video . Teenage gymnast Lauren Hill was diagnosed with scoliosis - an abnormal curvature of the spine - last year, after she went through a growth spurt and shot up six inches in the space of two months. Her spine was left bent at a 45 degree angle, right, resembling a c-shape, her mother Alison said . The condition threatened Lauren's career as a gymnast, preventing her from performing certain routines. But thanks to daily treatment, the 16-year-old is now standing tall and back in training. She is pictured with her physical therapist Michael Bradley . Ms Baker, 47, left with her daughter, said: 'She (Lauren) had a big growth spurt in 2014. She was short for her age and developed much later because of her sport, so when she grew five or six inches in a month it caused her spine to curve off in this c-shape' Her mother, 47, from Feltham in Middlesex, said: 'Acrobatics is Lauren's whole life, so it was so hard when we thought she'd have to stop - it really is everything to her so she was really upset. 'She had a big growth spurt in 2014. She was short for her age and developed much later because of her sport, so when she grew five or six inches in a month it caused her spine to curve off in this 'C' shape. 'The exercises she does now are specific to the individual and make the person really aware of their condition. 'Lauren now does 45 minutes of exercises per day - it's signing up to a different way of life but it's a small price to pay for something that improves her condition, halts progression of it and reduces pain as well.' Lauren's coach first noticed something was wrong when he saw her hips and shoulders appeared uneven, with one shoulder blade protruding. Her mother took the teenager to the GP, where she was initially diagnosed as having one leg shorter than the other. But Lauren began to suffer a lack of flexibility and agonising pain that prevented her from performing specific routines. On returning to hospital again, specialists diagnosed her with scoliosis. Ms Hill said she was told her daughter faced an operation to surgically straighten her spine. But the procedure would have put an end to Lauren's acrobatics for good. Ms Baker said: 'When I questioned the consultant over whether Lauren would still be able to participate in acrobatics or any other sport he replied ""she will only have flexibility at the base of her spine and will be able to swim"". Determined, Lauren refused surgery, deciding to look at alternative therapy with her mother instead. Lauren's back has now straightened out, left. And the gymnast, right, is preparing to take part in the World Championships next year in China . Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape. Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not handing properly and back pain. Pain usually only affects adults with the condition. In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children could of every 1,000. It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis. It is more common in women than in men. Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows. However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing. Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine. In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain. Source: NHS Choices . Lauren said: 'I was trying to train for the world championships when I found out I had scoliosis and it hurt so much. 'There were points where I thought I wouldn't be able to carry on, but I still would have hated surgery because I knew the outcome to that would not have necessarily been good either.' Ms Baker then discovered Scoliosis SOS - the only clinic in the world to offer treatment following the ScolioGold method, which is the combination of non-surgical treatments. While undergoing treatment, Lauren was taught a customised exercise programme specific to her condition over a span of four weeks. Charlie Meekings, patient care co-ordinator at Scoliosis SOS Clinic, said: 'It is important to know that there are other effective treatments available for scoliosis, not just those provided by the NHS. 'However, due to current legislation many health professionals are unable to disclose or discuss treatment options outside of the public sector. 'Our clinic prides itself on our ability to give free, impartial advice with no obligation to visit the clinic.' Lauren will now be trialing for a place to represent Team GB at the European Acrobatics and Gymnastics Championship in Germany later this year. Ms Baker said: 'She now has her eyes set on another World Championship trophy in China next year: something that seemed impossible only four weeks ago.'","Lauren Hill grew six inches in the space of two months last year .

"Don Collins, 29, (pictured in court during his trial) was jailed on Tuesday for 40 years for setting alight Robert Middleton, eight, in 1998 when he was 13 . A convicted child rapist has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for a childhood arson attack on a boy who died as a result nearly 13 years later. Don Collins, 29, was sentenced on Tuesday for pouring gasoline on Robert Middleton and setting him on fire on Middleton's eighth birthday in 1998 in Splendora, Texas. Prosecutors said Collins burned Robbie to silence him after he raped him several weeks earlier. Middleton endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer blamed on his burns. The 29-year-old Collins was convicted of capital murder. His punishment was capped at 40 years because he was 13 at the time of the attack. Don Collins showed no reaction as the verdict was read out, KHOU reported. During his trial, he had paid little attention to proceedings and had read the newspaper at times. At one point, he was overheard discussing his jail term with his lawyer and saying: 'The bright side of this is I'll come out with an education.' Prosecution and defense teams presented arguments on Tuesday before the jury started deliberating. The jury had heard from witnesses including one man who said Collins raped him and a woman who said the murderer stomped her kitten to death. Robbie Middleton's mother, Colleen, told the court: 'Everybody was afraid of him. He was the big bully that stomped kittens to death.' Another witness said that Collins should never be allowed out of jail because he would harm another child. Scroll down for video . Robert Middleton (pictured left and right) suffered burns across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer. He named his  attacker and rapist on video tape shortly before his death as Don Collins . Last week, the jury watched a heartbreaking, deathbed video of Robbie, who suffered 99 per cent burns, where he named the teenager who raped him then tied him up and set him alight in an attempt to cover up his crime. Robbie Middleton's frail voice named suspect Donald Collins as his rapist and torturer, just shortly before he passed away, aged 21, in 2011. Robbie's mother Colleen Middleton, pictured in court last week, testified Collins was 'a big bully' Robbie succumbed to cancer, believed to have been caused by the horrific burn injuries he suffered 13 years before. A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide. In 1998, Robbie was tied to a tree and set alight on his 8th birthday in woodland behind his home in Splendora, Texas. At trial last Thursday, the jury was shown a 30-minute video of Robbie just 17 days before he died. According to the Houston Chronicle, on the tape Robbie said: 'Don grabbed me, turned me around and threw gas in my face.' He said that he was blinded by the gasoline but when he realized he was on fire, he started to run from the woodland trail back home. He added: 'I was running as fast as I could but I couldn't see where I was running to', recalling that he was screaming and in horrific pain. The 21-year-old Robbie was then asked by the interviewer, attorney Craig Sico, if he was sexually assaulted by Collins. Robbie replied that two weeks before he was burned, Collins 'took me out into the woods where I was burned. He pulled my clothes down and started raping me'. The prosecution said Collins set  Robbie on fire to prevent his crime being discovered. Collins had pleaded not guilty. During the trial, Collins' defense lawyer claimed that Robbie, who spent most of his life at Shriner's Children's Hospital in Galveston, named Collins along with many others soon after the attack. Attorney E. Tay Bond said there was not enough evidence to convict Collins and accused the Middleton family's attorney of making up the rape theory. The defense team added that there were no witnesses to the attack and claimed prosecutors were playing to the jury's emotions. 'Do not expect the defense to bring an eyewitness to this tragedy because there is not one,' Bond told jurors. There are no witnesses from the woods except for Robbie.' Collins was convicted of raping another eight-year-old boy in 2001 at gunpoint. From the age of 16, he spent four years in a juvenile detention center for the crime. The victim testified at a 2013 hearing to determine whether Collins should be tried as an adult for the crime against Robbie Middleton. The victim said that Collins threatened to burn him if he told anyone about the assault. A judge determined last March that Collins could be tried for murder as an adult, despite being a teenager at the time. In 1998, Robbie had named Collins as his attacker and the 13-year-old was arrested. Collins spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to pursue the case. Robbie's mother Colleen Middleton choked back tears as she testified last week at the Houston court about how Collins had 'stalked' her son in the days before the attack. She testified that Robbie told her Don Collins, 13, had tied him up and set him on fire. Mrs Middleton, who found her badly-burned son collapsed by her home, said that in the months after the attack he was so delirious with pain that he named everyone he knew as his attacker - including the family dog. However, after almost a year, and when he began to regain lucidity, he named Don Collins as his attacker - and never wavered. Collins' capital murder sentence was capped at 40 years because he was 13 years old (pictured) when he  raped and set eight-year-old Robbie Middleton on fire .","Don Collins, 29, was sentenced on Tuesday for pouring gasoline on Robert Middleton and setting him on fire  in 1998 in Splendora, Texas .

"Six of the 23 top female chief executives in America are under pressure from activist investors who are challenging their leadership and pressing for major changes in their companies. Nelson Peltz, the renowned billionaire corporate raider behind Trian Fund Management, is targeting three companies with female CEOs - Ellen Kullman at DuPont, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo and Irene Rosenfeld at Mondelez International (formerly Kraft Foods.) Also under fire from activists are Marissa Mayer, the CEO of Yahoo!, Meg Whitman at Hewlett-Packard and Mary Barra at General Motors. The high profile names targeted by Trian in particular led Fortune magazine to ask: 'Does Nelson Peltz have a problem with women?' Marissa Mayer, the CEO of Yahoo!, (left) and Meg Whitman, the chief of Hewlett-Packard, (right) are both facing challenges to their leadership from activist hedge fund investors . Activist investor Nelson Peltz has targeted DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman, (left) Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld (center) and PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi (right) General Motors CEO Mary Barra is being pressured to buy back company stock and increase dividend payments to shareholders . The New York Times asks, 'Do activist investors - all of them men - see women as softer targets?' When asked by the Times, all of the investors in question bristled at the suggestion that they had targeted the companies in question because their CEOs are women. There are just 23 female CEOs among S&P 500 companies - meaning more than one quarter are facing pressure from activist investors. Research is divided on how female CEOs perform compared to their male peers. Some studies show that their companies have performed better - others show their firms were worse off. Activist investors buy up a small percentage of a company's stock and seek to improve shareholder value by publicly challenging the CEO and board leaders by demanding changes. Activist funds have been on the rise since the financial meltdown, with more than $120billion under investment - up from about $35billion in 2008, according to the Economist. And they have been prolific - mounting challenges to 15percent of all S&P 500-listed companies since 2009, the newspaper reports. Renowned corporate raider Nelson Pelz's positions in DuPont, Mondelez and PepsiCo led Fortune magazine to ask whether he 'has a problem with women' Fortune reports that Peltz is pressuring Kullman to break up the 212-year-old DuPont into three companies, believing that they could be more efficient than the conglomerate is now. He recently won four seats on the company's board of directors. Nooyi, meanwhile is being pressured to split up PepsiCo's snack food unit and its beverage unit into two separate companies. Peltz is also pressuring PepsiCo's Frito-Lay brand to combine with Mondelez, which owns brands like Oreo cookies, Toblerone candy and Ritz, Triscuit and Wheat Thins crackers. He sits on Mondelez's board of directors. Thus far, the CEOs of all three companies have been able to withstand pressure from Peltz, though he has proved a dogged and persuasive activist throughout his career. Meanwhile, Mayer - who was herself installed as a result of pressure from an activist investor - is now facing pressure from Starboard Value, led by Jeffrey Smith. The firm has demanded that Yahoo! sell off its Japanese subsidiary and divest from Chinese internet retail giant Alibaba Group. It also said Yahoo! should not make any large purchases to expand its holdings. Hedge funder J. Kyle Bass is pushing Barra for a seat on the board of GM and is demanding the company buy back some of its stock and increase its dividend to shareholders. Whitman was forced to give Ralph V Whitworth a seat on the board of HP to stop him from waging a proxy war for control. Fortune points out that Peltz, worth an estimated $1.65billion, is on his third wife. Claudia Hefner, a former model, is the mother of eight of his ten children - including daughter Nicola, an actress who starred in the latest 'Transformers' movie and 'The Last Airbender.'","Nelson Peltz, the head of Trian Fund Management, is targeting three companies with female CEOs .

"A furious mother has slammed the NHS after her 'fit and active' 11-year-old son was sent home from school with a letter branding him overweight. Coralyn Hobbs, 35, was stunned when her son William Barnes-Hobbs arrived home from Ely St Mary's Junior School in Cambridgeshire with a letter advising he needed to make 'lifestyle changes' to get to a normal weight. It came after William and his his classmates were measured at their school as part of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP). Furious Coralyn Hobbs (left) has slammed the NHS after her 'fit and active' 11-year-old son William (right) was sent home from school with a letter branding him overweight . Ms Hobbs said her son was an 'extremely fit and active boy', and said categorising children as overweight or obese is 'disgraceful' Health staff recorded the weight and height of each pupil before the sending the findings to parents to tell them what category they fall in to. Ms Hobbs was then informed that William, who is 4ft 9in tall and weighed six-and-a-half stone, was in the overweight category, according to NHS scales. She describes the results as 'disgraceful' and would cause some children to develop an eating disorder. 'I feel hurt for him and all the other children who are labelled overweight or obese,' said the mother-of-two. William and his his classmates were measured at their school as part of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) 'The sad thing is that these days, unless you're stick thin, you're automatically classed as overweight. 'It's not fair and certainly not good to be encouraging children to think like that when all you hear is that eating disorders are on the rise. 'I think it's disgraceful that children are being categorised in this way. William isn't overweight. I'd say he's perfectly proportioned actually. 'Yet just because of his height and weight he's labelled overweight. It's wrong.' The NCMP measures children in Reception class and Year 6 and takes into consideration their age, height and sex. Children are then given a letter to take home, telling their parents or carers what category they fall into, and what lifestyle changes they could make, should they wish to. If William weighed just 3lbs less or was one inch taller than he would have been classified as 'healthy' but Ms Hobbs says he already fits into this category. 'He eats healthily, including his five fruit and veg a day,' said Ms Hobbs, who also lives with her partner Ian Barnes and their daughter Kayleigh-Jane. 'He also eats a lot of homegrown things, including home-reared meats. 'He's an extremely fit and active boy. He plays a lot of sport, bikes everyday, goes fishing everyday and is generally always outdoors.' Mandy Mayes, lead nurse for the NCMP in Cambridgeshire, said she recognised the programme can be a 'sensitive topic'. She said: 'We would like to reassure parents that, along with trusts across the country, the NCMP team uses a nationally accredited NHS measure to establish a child's weight status, taking into consideration their age, height and sex. 'This information is then shared with parents or carers who are offered further support to make any lifestyle changes they may wish, which is entirely voluntary. 'We do recognise this can be a sensitive topic and would encourage parents to contact us if they wish to discuss any aspect of their child's health.' A spokesman for Ely St Mary's Junior School said the programme was part of a national scheme. She said: 'This is a national screening programme which all schools are involved in.' Children in William's class at Ely St Mary's Junior School in Cambridgeshire (pictured) were weighed and had their height measured . Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said the NCMP was designed to be used for statistical use, and should not be used to inform children that they are overweight. 'It's not a precise measurement,' he told MailOnline. The Body Mass Index is used to measure their amount of body fat a person is carrying. Medics use a modified BMI scale with children that takes account of their age and sex. One in three children in Britain is classed as 'overweight' according to official government figures. Children are classed as either underweight, healthy weight, overweight or very overweight. According the National Childhood Measurement Programme: 'It can be difficult to tell if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age. That’s why we use the measurement of weight against height to get an accurate measure.'Research shows that if your child is overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult. This can lead to health problems in later life, so this measurement is an important way of checking how your child is growing.' 'There are many children who have their parents informed by letter that they are overweight and the parents are furious because the child is of build that is not overweight for their stature. 'The letters sent out are a combination of a mail merge between computer data, and there needs to be the intervention of a school nurse - who as a human being is far better equipped to decide if a child is overweight. 'When the parent has the letter they can decide how valid it is and if it is valid the parent needs to be careful how he or she transmits the information to the child. 'It is quite possible that the child could be given the wrong message. 'Children of 11 should never go on diets, they need all the nutrition they can get and being told they are overweight could have tragic consequences. 'I hope parents will provide their children with sensible advice and make sure the child does not dwell on the letter, but gets all the good things like the right food and exercise. 'I would think in this case the parent would be furious and this is the danger of the child measurement programme - it was never designed to be a clinical programme, but was intended as a statistical tool.' Ms Hobbs was informed that William, who is 4ft 9in tall and weighed six-and-a-half stone, was in the overweight category, according to NHS scales .","William Barnes-Hobbs weighed and measured at Cambridgeshire school .

"One of the men suspected of murdering poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko wanted to be a 'porno star' and had no links to the gas and oil industry as he claimed, an inquiry has heard. Dmitri Kovtun struggled with a drink problem and worked as a waiter and pot washer in restaurants in Germany before he reunited with his childhood friend, former KGB officer Andrei Lugovoi, in Russia in June 2006, his former wives said in police interviews read to the Royal Courts of Justice. Both men are prime suspects in the murder of Mr Litvinenko, 43, who died nearly three weeks after he consumed tea laced with polonium-210 on November 1, 2006 at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square. They deny any involvement and remain in Russia. Alexander Litvinenko, pictured, was an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin before his death . Dmitri Kovtun, left, and Andrei Logovoi, right, would both be arrested for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko if they were to return to the UK to testimony at the inquiry into the former spy's death in London . Detective Inspector Craig Mascall from the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit told the inquiry into Mr Litvinenko's death that British officers travelled to Moscow to interview Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun in December 2006. During the interview, Mr Kovtun listed his jobs as director general of gas and oil provider Global Project and as an employee of Continental Petroleum Limited, the inquiry heard. But in an extract of a police interview given by his ex-wife Inne Hohne, which was read to the court, she said: 'Dmitri wanted to be a porno star. He never said anything about any brokerage deals or sales. I have now read his interview in (German newspaper) Spiegel and have read that there was trade with gas and with oil. I can only say that this has absolutely nothing to do with Dmitri.' Mr Kovtun's second wife Marina Wall also told police her ex-husband had worked as a waiter and pot washer in restaurants in Germany before he began working with Mr Lugovoi in Russia. Addressing Mr Mascall, Andrew O'Connor, counsel to the inquiry, said: 'So there is a clutch of documents apparently asserting that Mr Kovtun is running a company, is involved in oil projects. On the face of it, not entirely consistent with his earlier life.' Mr Mascall replied: 'There is evidence from other witnesses who say Mr Kovtun was a bit of a dreamer and he suggested he was going to do all sorts of projects when he left Germany, but I would be speculating. He would appear to have done very well for himself.' The inquiry heard that Mr Kovtun, left, and Mr Lugovoi, right, have known each other since childhood although they both deny any involvement in Mr Litvinenko's murder who died after drinking radioactive tea . Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi had known each since childhood and attended the same military academy in Russia, the court heard. Mr Kovtun was stationed in Germany with the Russian army but fled to Hamburg and sought political asylum after getting married, the inquiry was told. He later split from his first wife because she said he had a 'drink problem,' Mr Mascall said. The inquiry heard that Mr Lugovoi, now a Russian politician, was in hospital for exposure to radioactive material when Scotland Yard officers questioned him in Moscow. In a newspaper interview two years after Mr Litvinenko's death, Mr Lugovoi said he believed the murdered spy was a 'traitor' and that anyone who caused damage to Russia should be 'exterminated', the inquiry into his death has heard. In an extract of the interview shown to the inquiry, Mr Lugovoi was asked whether he agreed with Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) that Mr Litvinenko - who worked for the British intelligence services after moving to the UK - was a 'traitor'. He replied: 'I think so as well. That doesn't mean that a traitor has to be immediately killed.' He added: 'If someone has caused the Russian state serious damage, they should be exterminated. This is my firm belief and the belief of any normal Russian.' The inquiry heard Mr Lugovoi told embassy staff his salary was 285,000 roubles when he applied for a travel visa to visit the UK in 2006, while Mr Kovtun said he earned 65,000 roubles a month. Mr O'Connor asked Mr Mascall: 'Those two men are currently wanted for the offence of murder? The murder of Mr Litvinenko?' He replied: 'That's correct.' Mr O'Connor asked what action would be taken should either men return to the UK. Mr Mascall replied: 'They would be arrested for the offence of murder.' Mr Lugovoi, pictured, told one newspaper that Mr Litvinenko should be 'exterminated' as he was a 'traitor' Mr Lugovoi, a father-of-four, previously worked at the KGB as a security officer for former Russian prime minister Yegor Gaidar before becoming head of security at Russian broadcaster ORT, and later setting up his own private security company called Ninth Wave. He first met Mr Litvinenko in 1995 when the murder victim was protecting Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky following a failed assassination attempt, the court heard. Mr Lugovoi, who was jailed for 14 months for organising the escape of a prisoner in 2001, met Mr Litvinenko again when he travelled to London to watch CSKA Moscow play Chelsea in 2004 and on a number of further occasions in 2006, including at Mr Litvinenko's house.

"Harrowing video shows a US Airways plane landing without its nose gear in Houston on Monday night after a malfunction. With 53 passengers aboard, the Embraer 190 touched down and skidded on its nose along the runway - causing sparks to fly out on both sides. Flight 1825 from Philadelphia was preparing to land at George Bush Intercontinental Airport at 10pm when the nose landing gear failed to deploy. The pilots of the commuter jet had no choice but to make an emergency landing. Touchdown: Sparks can be seen flying from US Airways Flight 1825 after it was forced to land in Houston without its nose gear . Fire: The flight landed at 10.23pm. The Houston Fire Department was on the scene and the reported fire was extinguished around 10.40pm . Passengers: Passengers had to deplane using chutes and one was transported to a local hospital with unknown injuries . '56 souls on board 3,000 pounds of gas and we plan on evacuating on the runway ... emergency in progress,' according to air tower radio traffic. A video from KTRK shows huge sparks under the nose of the plane as it touched down on the runway. Firefighters met the plane on the runway and passengers used emergency exit chutes on both sides of the craft. One person sustained a minor injury during the landing and evacuation and was hospitalized. 'They did a couple turns around the airport airspace, talked to the FAA tower, tried to get visual confirmation that the nose gear was in fact inoperable,' airport spokesman  David Hebert told KHOU-TV. 'Unfortunately it wasn't working properly.' As the pilot touched down, smoke filled the cabin - likely from the friction caused by the nose-landing. US Airways and the Federal Aviation Administration said they are investigating why the landing gear didn't work. Decisions: A spokesperson with the airport said that the pilot noticed that the landing gear was not coming down and decided to make the landing .","A US Airways plane was forced to make an emergency landing without its nose gear at Bush Intercontinental Airport on Monday .

"Fierce fighting raged in eastern Ukraine last night as government forces and Russian-backed rebels each tried to seize territory ahead of today’s crucial peace talks. Ukrainian troops advanced on rebel frontlines near the seaport of Mariupol, a key coastal position between rebel-controlled areas and the Crimean peninsula. Russian-backed separatist forces moved to encircle the vital railway hub of Debaltseve, the focus of vicious fighting in past weeks, cutting it off from supply lines. It is understood that at least seven Ukrainian troops have been killed in the most recent fighting along with two civilians. A further 12 civilians were injured. Scroll down for video . Devastation: A woman cries out in anger after her apartment block in Donetsk is set on fire as a result of shelling. Fighting between the two sides in Ukraine has intensified in recent weeks . An elderly woman has to be helped to her feet after discovering that the apartment block where she lives has been damaged by shelling . Refuge: The lucky ones who make it to Slavyansk are housed in dusty old railway cars, stinking of coal-heated boilers and barely functional toilets . Railway car: The families set up camp in the cars’ sleeping compartments, using old railway linens and donated blankets to ward off the freezing temperatures outside . Pensioners and parents with young children  caught in the firing line between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels backed by Moscow, rifle through piles of donated clothes in Soviet-era army tents. Crowds of people pack into the cramped shelters next to Slavyansk railway station, which are serving as a base  for a small group of volunteers providing food and clothing to an ever-increasing number of refugees flooding into this once quiet coal mining town in east Ukraine’s war torn Donetsk region. Inside the tents, haggard looking former residents of Debaltseve and Gorlovka queue for plates of porridge and pickled vegetables, telling harrowing stories of GRAD rocket barrages and life in bomb shelters. ‘A week ago I dislocated my shoulder and had to find a way out,' said native Tatiana, who asked that her surname not be published for fear of recrimination towards family members who remain behind. 'The shelling is constant. There was no way I could stay. My entire family stayed behind. They’re still there. 'I have no idea if they’re brave or just stupid and don’t understand how serious the situation really is.’ With little coordinated help from the international community and an economy in free fall, the Ukrainian government relies on local private donors and volunteers to care for the daily stream of displaced people pouring into areas controlled by units loyal to Kiev. Life in Debaltseve and nearby Gorlovka – a major rail hub of 300,000 people - has been nothing short of hell on earth for those who have endured months of heavy shelling from both sides. Since the fall of Donetsk Airport – and with it most of Kiev’s best combat troops - to pro-Russian forces two weeks ago, Debaltseve, in particular, has become the focus of a drawn-out national tragedy. Harrowing: The refugees tell disturbing stories of GRAD rocket barrages and life inside bomb shelters . Keeping warm: Pensioners and parents with young children caught in the firing line between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels backed by Moscow rifle through piles of donated clothes in Soviet-era army tents . Childhood: Parents, with their children in tow, are housed in dusty old railway cars, stinking of coal-heated boilers and barely functional toilets . On the outskirts of Donetsk, people carry plastic bags filled with their personal belongings from a burning apartment block . For the Ukrainian public, the months-long stand at the airport came to represent a modern-day Battle of Thermopylae – with the defenders cast as King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors in a heroic last stand. For Debaltseve, however, the fate of the beleaguered civilian population and the outnumbered units that continue to hold the line, is rapidly beginning to resemble Sarajevo in the early 1990s. Pro-Russian rebels have nearly cut the city off, leaving thousands stranded and huddling in makeshift bomb shelters. Rockets and artillery shells are fired indiscriminately from their positions and into the town. A brief ceasefire last weekend succeeded in most of the population being led to safety, but estimates from most aid agencies place the number of those who stayed behind at as high as 3,000. Grandmother Lilia Petrovna said: 'The bombing (in Debaltseve) never stops. 'The shells hit homes, schools, parks, it doesn’t matter. My house took a direct hit from a  rocket.

'It was at that moment that the kids’ parents and I decided we should get everyone out.' With her four grandchildren surrounding her, she added ‘We hope to be here for ten days or so, after that we don’t know where to go.’ Those who remain trapped in the city endure constant shelling and attacks with notoriously inaccurate GRAD multiple rocket launchers. Basic amenities have been cut and access corridors out of the city are growing fewer by the day as heavy fighting in and out of the centre becomes fiercer. The lucky ones who make it to Slavyansk are housed in dusty old railway cars, stinking of coal-heated boilers and barely functional toilets. These relics of the Soviet Union’s vast railway network are, for now, temporary homes of hundreds of families, many of whom no longer have a standing home to return to or relatives to stay with.

Many others – including the elderly – are left sleeping on the cabins’ cold wood benches.

Talks: Obama, at a White House news conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said providing weapons to Ukraine was among the options he and his advisers were considering . Whole families have been uprooted in recent days as the rebels come closer to their objective of fully surrounding Debaltseve. Today, the Ukrainian national guard has launched an offensive against pro-Russian separatists near the southeastern port city of Mariupol. The secretary to the National Security and Defence Council, Oleksander Turchynov, 'is near Mariupol, where units of the national guard broke through enemy defences and went on the offensive', a statement from Ukraine's security council said in an online statement. Separatist gains against Kiev government forces in eastern Ukraine, particularly a rebel advance on the transport hub of Debaltseve to the northeast of Donetsk, have added impetus to a Franco-German initiative to try to end the crisis. President Obama signaled on Monday he will wait for the results of high-stakes talks on Ukraine before deciding whether to arm the Kiev government, saying diplomacy and sanctions remain his preferred tools to resolve the crisis. Obama, at a White House news conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said providing weapons to Ukraine was among the options he and his advisers were considering. Fighting between pro-Russian rebels and pro-government forces loyal to Kiev has intensified in Ukraine's south east region since the new year . Pro-government forces unload Grad rockets from a truck before launching them towards pro-Russian separatist forces outside Debaltseve in eastern Ukraine . But he made clear he had reservations about upping the ante in Ukraine and endangering U.S.-European unity in the contest of wills with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Merkel opposes sending weapons to Kiev to help it fight Russian-backed separatists. 'It is true that if, in fact, diplomacy fails, what I've asked my team to do is to look at all options,' Obama said. 'But I have not made a decision about that yet.' Despite prompting by a German reporter, the U.S. president pointedly declined to lay down a 'red line' that, should Putin cross it, would prompt him to authorise weapons for Ukraine. In the face of a new offensive by separatists in eastern Ukraine, some of Obama's top advisors, as well as hawkish U.S. lawmakers, are pressing him to do more to help the Ukrainian government defend itself. But that question has been overshadowed, at least temporarily, by a revived diplomatic push led by Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. The pair are due to meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Belarus tomorrow. The conflict between Russia-backed separatists and government forces has now killed more than 5,300 people and displaced more than a million.","Refugees are given food and clothes in Ukraine’s war torn Donetsk region .

"A fed-up woman in a Croatian village has won a court order banning her neighbour's dog from barking during the night saying its constant noise was affecting her health. Three-year-old Medo is now not allowed to make any noise between 8pm and 8am and is the only dog in the country to have a no-barking injunction. His owner Anton Simunovic has also been told he must keep the dog quiet and has been threatened with a 2,800 euro (£2,083) fine if his pet breaches the order. Dog Medo barks in his backyard in a northern Croatian village. The pet has been banned from making any noise at night by a court in the country . In charges filed by Simunovic's neighbour, she says that the constant barking at night is ruining her health. But Mr Simunovic refutes the claim saying Medo behaves like any other dog. He said: 'He barks normally, like any dog does. Medo's owner Anton Simunovic attempts to keep his pet quiet. Mr Simunovic has also been threatened with a fine Medo doesn't stop barking at night . 'He barks when he sees a cat, or if someone unknown comes to his territory.' The order now means that Medi must spend the nights confined in a barn rather than being allowed to roam free. A court in the town of Pula still has to make a final ruling on the case, with the neighbour also seeking 1,400 euros (£1,041) in damages. More than 30,000 people have joined a Facebook page to support Medo and posted pictures of their pets in a show of solidarity . Medo's troubles have also sparked widespread social media interest in Croatia with more than 30,000 people joining Facebook page to support him. The page was set up since the case emerged last month.

"They might have spent the last two weeks in a £14,000 Caribbean villa but, laden with bags and carrying their young son, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looked very much like any other set of parents as they strode through St. Lucia's tiny airport. The family was seen boarding a British Airways plane as they prepared to travel back to London, following their annual holiday on the island of Mustique. Kate, who is almost seven months pregnant, and William were on the island to celebrate Carole Middleton's 60th birthday on the 31st January, as well as for a final family break before they become parents for a second time in April. Scroll down for video . On their way: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge board a British Airways plane en route to London . 18-month-old George was carried up the steps by his mother, who looked comfortable in a loose navy shirt and skinny jeans, and wore her hair scraped back. William, meanwhile, got the job of carrying the  hand luggage and clutched a £74.95 floral-print holdall from Joules as he made his way into the plane behind one of the couple's two protection officers. The couple have spent the last two weeks at the Villa Rocina on the secluded island of Mustique, with the Middleton clan, including James, 27, and Pippa, 31. They were there for Mrs Middleton's birthday celebrations, which, according to sources, was fun, informal and noisy and included bespoke cocktails created especially for the event. Along with Pippa and James, rumoured guests included Basil Charles, the owner of Mustique's much-loved Basil's Bar, and the island's resident doctor Michael Bunbury and his wife Lotty.

The couple are heading back for the start of an intense period of engagements, beginning with the Duchess of Cambridge's visit to Hampshire on Thursday. 32-year-old William is currently studying for the pilot's licence that will enable him to fly EC145 T2 aircraft when he joins the East Anglia Air Ambulance Service this summer. Although the prince is already qualified to fly a Sea King helicopter, his new role requires five months of training, which he is currently completing, 14 exams and a flight test. Break: The Cambridges have been enjoying a two-week break in Mustique with the Middleton clan . Celebration: The holiday also included a 60th birthday celebration for Mrs Middleton . Busy: Kate, who is almost seven months pregnant, will have a busy run of engagements on her return . Once qualified, he will be part of the team who fly day and night shifts and attend a variety of emergencies, ranging from road crashes to heart attacks. The Duke's new job will require him to spend more time in Norfolk, where he and the Duchess of Cambridge have their new home, Anmer House. With its sugar-sand beaches and gently swaying palms, it's no surprise that the Caribbean has proved a hit with holidaying royalty.

Part of the Leeward Islands, the island is one of four that make up the French West Indies, and is home to popular celebrity haunts such as Maya's, a beachside restaurant just outside the capital Gustavia. ‘The Caribbean island of St Barts is synonymous with the rich and famous, from Beyonce and Jay-Z to Roman Abramovich,' says MailOnline acting travel editor, Sarah Gordon. Favourite: Princess Margaret owned a home on Mustique and spent much of her time there . While celebrities are certainly seen here, it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates who really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot. ‘All of that makes it perfect for the royals, who can enjoy the island’s relative privacy and lack of “riff raff” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach, ensuring most holidaymakers head elsewhere.' Almost as popular with the royal set is the exclusive island of Mustique, which in January last year, was the scene of Prince George's first ever trip abroad. While the little prince stayed in a rented villa with his Middleton relatives and did so again this year, his great aunt Princess Margaret, another royal fond of a Mustique break, sunned in style in the garden of the villa she owned on the island.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge flew home to the UK today .

"This is the garish two-tone velvet Land Rover which has been spotted on the streets of Manchester. The £60,000 Land Rover Discovery, surrounded in a red and blue eye-catching wrap, was seen parked for ten minutes in the city's plush King Street shopping area today. The vehicle's normal paint job has been replaced by dark blue velvet across the body of the car, while the roof has been covered in red velvet - a job which would have cost thousands. Scroll down for video . Britain's most vulgar car? The garish two-tone velvet Land Rover spotted on the streets of Manchester . Garish: The £60,000 Land Rover Discovery, surrounded in a red and blue eye-catching wrap, was seen parked in the city's plush King Street shopping area . The owner is the latest in a string of luxury car owners around the globe which have opted to have their cats coated in the extravagant woven fabric. And the unmissable supercars appear to attract the public’s attention everywhere they go. While it was parked, shoppers were seen walking up to the car to catch a look - or a feel - of the unique material, despite the driver still being inside. One shopper said: 'People kept walking up to the car to touch it. It felt really nice. The driver didn't look too happy that everyone kept touching his expensive car. 'I'd never seen a car like it before, especially in such a vulgar two-tone colour. It really stood out. 'The driver was brave taking it out in Manchester during January because I can't imagine you'd want to get it wet!' Velvet touch: The vehicle's normal paint job has been replaced by dark blue velvet across the body of the car, while the roof has been covered in red velvet . The velvet wrap, which comes in a range of colours, is one of the latest trends in super car customisation. A British company, Raccoon, was responsible for the UK's first velvet-covered car - a black Porsche that became an internet sensation when it was seen in London last summer. The car came to the attention of the world when former Apprentice contestant James Lester spotted the Panamera outside his estate agents in Fulham, west London. Sleek: This velvet-covered Rolls Royce Phantom drophead coupe was spotted in London in December 2014 . Attention-grabbing: Two curious passers-by stop to stroke the vehicle, which costs an estimated £300,000 . Vibrant: The material comes in a range of other colours, including blue, orange - and this shocking hot pink . Racoon says its service has proved increasingly popular as an alternative to ‘boring’ standardised paintwork. The service involves ‘wrapping’ the cars in a durable and weather resistant fibre to the colour of the driver's choice. The wrap is then coated with special adhesives and durable textile fibers to withstand severe weather conditions. The material, which lasts for roughly three years, can be cleaned by hand or using a jet wash and does not need special products. The first velvet-wrapped car, a £100,000 Porsche Panamera, was spotted in Fulham, London last year . Bespoke: The owner of this car asked Raccoon to include a red gold panel in the centre of the black velvet .

"Six in ten Britons consider themselves to be overweight, a study has revealed. Despite this, fewer adults are trying to lose weight than three years ago and physical exercise is dropping in popularity, it found. Britons are the most likely people in Europe to brand themselves overweight, according to the global health and wellness survey from analysts Nielsen. Overweight: Six in 10 Britons consider themselves to be overweight, according to a new survey. And among those who do regard themselves as too heavy, 22 per cent believe they are 'somewhat' or 'very' overweight, while 38 per cent say a 'little'. The survey of more than 30,000 adults in 60 countries found most people in Europe, or 52 per cent, see themselves as overweight, however those in Poland and Russia are the least likely to do so. Less than half – or 46 per cent – of Britons are trying to lose weight compared with 51 per cent three years ago, the poll found. Among those, changing diet is the most popular method, followed by exercise. The percentage who are opting for a 'quick fix' via diet pills, bars or shakes has more than doubled. Taking medicine prescribed by a doctor has doubled. The most popular diet change involve eating less chocolate and sugar, followed by cutting back on fats and eating more natural, fresh foods. Four in ten simply eat smaller portions of the same food. The study, which polled more than 30,000 respondents in 60 countries, shows that most people in Europe (52%) consider themselves overweight, while Polish (35%) and Russian (40%) people are the least likely to regard themselves overweight. Exercise: But Britons are now more likely to look for a quick fix solution to their weight problems, and less likely to exercise to keep fit . Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of business and retailer insight, said: 'Not only are fewer Britons trying to lose weight, it seems they're slowly becoming increasingly reliant on easier fixes at the expense of harder work such as changing diet and exercise.' Around one-in-10 follow a low carbohydrate/high fat diet or another diet, while eight per cent use a slimming plan. Britons are twice as likely to use a slimming plan and 28% more likely to cut down on processed foods, but 40% less likely to follow a low carb/high fat diet to lose weight. Mr Watkins said: 'Britons regard sugar, salt, artificial additives, cholesterol and fat as the biggest health-related evils impacting which products they buy. 'Conversely, natural flavours, being made from fruit or veg, whole grain, fibre and protein are the most important ingredients to encourage purchasing. 'Britons, however, are much less likely than Europeans - and people globally, as a whole - to let health attributes of food products affect what they buy.' Among the 27 food health attributes covered in the survey, Britons are most willing to pay a premium price for products that are 'all natural', 'gluten-free' or organic. Britons are much less likely to pay a premium for healthy attributes in foods than Europeans as a whole.","More Britons consider themselves overweight, says extensive survey .

"Schools in deprived areas are denying pupils access to tougher GCSE subjects in a bid to improve their league table ranking, research suggests. Particular concerns have been raised over access to triple science GCSE, with up to half the schools in some areas refusing to offer it, according to data published today. Researchers said it was clear school leaders were trying to minimise poor exam results by ushering pupils towards easier subjects. Some GCSE students are being steered away from more difficult subjects by schools keen to boost their rankings, according to a report by the Open Public Services Network (OPSN) at the RSA think-tank . The alarming findings come after the Government launched a crackdown on schools trying to ‘play’ the system by refusing to include poor-quality qualifications in league tables. The research, carried out by Open Public Services Network (OPSN) at the RSA think-tank, showed access to tough subjects varied according to postcode. Roger Taylor, chairman of the OPSN, said: ‘This would be of little concern if these differences reflected the needs and choices of pupils and families. ‘Our worry is that instead they reflect decisions made by schools and are based on calculations as to how schools can appear better on league tables by encouraging children to avoid taking on more challenging subjects.’ He added that the evidence suggests in areas where most children are expected to do less well in exams, ‘the educational opportunities for all children are being restricted’. The figures show in North East Lincolnshire, 50 per cent of the ten secondary schools did not offer triple science GCSE. More than a third of schools do not enter any pupils for triple science in Knowsley, Slough, Kingston upon Hull and Newcastle. In contrast, in Sussex and Cumbria – local authorities with more than 30 schools – every school offers GCSEs in three sciences. The disparity is so huge that children in Knowsley, Merseyside, are half as likely to be enrolled for triple science GCSE as children in Buckinghamshire. Children in Kensington are four times more likely to be enrolled for a language GCSE than children in Middlesbrough where, on average, only one child in every four takes a language GCSE. RSA Director of Public Services, Charlotte Alldritt, said: ‘Breadth of subject availability is being denied to our young people and curtailing their life chances’ In a report to be published next week, the RSA will warn of ‘subject deserts’ within certain local authorities, with pupils not given the option of finding a school which offers the subjects they want to study. The report will argue that local authorities are unlikely to be able to tackle the problem with a growing number of schools converting to academy status – and thus enjoying greater autonomy. It will also lay out concerns about the Department of Education’s ‘accountability regime’, in which schools are rated on the number of points they achieve in exams. The report will argue the system can incentivise schools to offer more limited opportunities to children in an effort to maximise the school’s rating. RSA Director of Public Services, Charlotte Alldritt, said: ‘Breadth of subject availability is being denied to our young people and curtailing their life chances.’ Last month, league tables showed twice as many state secondary schools are now considered to be underperforming compared with last year. The increase was because of new rules that banned schools from including results from re-sits and poor-quality vocational courses. Critics at the time said the changes had impacted schools operating in poor areas the most.","Research by the Open Public Services Network (OPSN) at the RSA think-tank shows access to tough subjects varies according to postcode .

"New York Fashion Week has brought in more revenue for the city than last year's Super Bowl. New research has found that the two Fashion Weeks held in September and February generate nearly $900 million for the city, while the 2014 Super Bowl, which was held in neighboring East Rutherford, New Jersey, only brought in $500 million. 'The economic impact of New York's Fashion Weeks is massive!' New York Representative Carolyn Maloney said in a press release for her new financial report on the industry. Money maker: Naomi Campbell and Kendall Jenner lead models down the runway at Diane von Furstenberg's spring 2015 show. New York Fashion Week brings in nearly $900 million for the city according to a new report . Massive show: Last year's Super Bowl was held at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey and generated $500 million for New York City . The research conducted by Mrs Maloney and the US Congress Joint Economic Committee shows that Fashion Week is the city's leading money-making event with more than 230,000 people attending the shows. That number jumps to more than 500,000 when combined with industry trade shows and showroom visits. New findings: New York Representative Carolyn Maloney unveiled her report on the economic impact of the fashion industry last Friday . New York Fashion Week has a $887 million economic impact on the city, including the $547 million that comes directly from visitor spending. Comparably, the US Tennis Open brings in $700 million over the course of two weeks, while the New York City Marathon generates $340 million. According to the research, New York Fashion Week has even 'eclipsed' the fashion weeks held in London, Paris and Milan. Mrs Maloney unveiled the report last Friday at a press conference held at the Fashion Institute of Technology. 'It really astounded me,' she told WWD of her findings. 'As my first report as the ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, I wanted to do it on fashion, and what I found out blew me away.' Mrs Maloney admitted that she didn't 'realize the importance of the fashion industry to our country and New York City' until she started working on the report. 'More broadly, the fashion industry is an important segment of the city's economy, employing over 180,000 people, including 16,000 manufacturing jobs, paying $11 billion in wages and generating almost $2 billion in tax revenue each year,' she said. Her research has also found that New York City's fashion industry is bringing back jobs that were once shipped overseas. Mrs Maloney added: 'I hope this new report helps reawaken lawmakers and policy makers to understand and appreciate the huge financial impact of the fashion industry.'","The Fashion Weeks held in September and February bring in nearly $900 million in revenue for New York City according to a new report .

"The Islamic State's affiliate in Egypt has released a video purporting to show the beheading of eight Bedouin men it accused of working for the Egyptian and Israeli armies. The video, posted on the group's Twitter account late on Monday, also showed what it said were victims of Egyptian military operations in the restive Sinai Peninsula. An insurgency there has killed scores of policemen and soldiers. The Islamic State's affiliate in Egypt Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis has released a video purporting to show the beheading of eight men it accused of working for the Egyptian and Israeli armies. The group last year posted a similar video (above) in which four men, accused of being Israeli Mossad spies, were executed . The jihadist group, known as Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis before pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group last November, has released footage in the past showing the execution of alleged informants. In the latest video, masked militants in camouflage behead eight men, some of them in broad daylight at a major thoroughfare in north Sinai. The men were first made to confess they worked for the armies of Egypt and Israel, which borders the Sinai and have been attacked by militants from the peninsula several times over the past three years. It came as suspected Islamist militants set off five bombs in Egypt's second city Alexandria today and air raids afterwards in the Sinai Peninsula killed 15 suspected extremists. It was not clear if the air raids in Sinai were in retaliation for the Alexandria blasts. Military officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Three blasts near police stations in eastern Alexandria wounded 10 people, while two other bombs went off in the area without casualties, said Major General Amin Ezz al-Din, an assistant interior minister for Alexandria. Egyptian security personnel check cars at a checkpoint near the site, where separate attacks on security forces in North Sinai on Thursday killed 30 people, in Arish, North Sinai, Egypt on January 31 . Later on Tuesday, 15 suspected militants were killed and eight others wounded in air raids in the Sinai town of Sheikh Zuweid, security sources said. Security sources also said a two-year-old boy was in critical condition after being wounded in clashes between militants and the army south of the border town of Rafah near the Gaza Strip. Frequent small-scale attacks such as the bombings in Alexandria have hurt Egypt's efforts to project an image of stability after four years of turmoil triggered by the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. Egypt hosts an investment conference next month in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh in the southern Sinai Peninsula, and hopes to attract funds to turn around an economy battered by instability. The Egyptian affiliate of Islamic State, the militant group controlling large parts of Syria and Iraq, claimed responsibility for attacks on security forces in Sinai late last month that killed at least 30 people. Sinai's Islamist militants have stepped up their attacks on security forces since the army toppled president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 after protests against his rule. Egypt has launched a crackdown in Sinai in response and systematically repressed Muslim Brotherhood supporters and other political opponents across the country.

"It is a rare meeting of two of the most beautiful phenomenon on Earth. Nasa astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore captured the amazing moment an aurora and a sunrise 'collide' 'All we need now are angels singing,' Wilmore wrote. Scroll down for video . Nasa astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore captured the amazing moment an aurora and a sunrise 'collide' - here the sunrise can be seen beginning to creep in on the right of the image. The video, taken by astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore aboard the ISS, follows the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, and captures the moment 'sunrise touches aurora.' Nasa filmed the footage over Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts before the clip was sped up and posted online. Northern Lights is the common name for Aurora Borealis, a light show of varying colours caused by collisions between electrically-charged particles from the sun that enter the Earth's atmosphere. Aurora are one effect of energetic particles which can speed out from the sun both in a steady stream called the solar wind and due to giant eruptions known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. After a trip toward Earth that can last two to three days, the solar particles and magnetic fields cause the release of particles already trapped near Earth. As the video progresses, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts are passed over - as the sunrise 'touches' the aurora. This in turn trigger reactions in the upper atmosphere in which oxygen and nitrogen molecules are released a particles of light. The strong solar flare which created this aurora triggered a radio blackout for parts of Earth over the weekend, according to an alert from the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center. Usually the best spots to see the lights are those places close to the North Pole, such as Iceland and Norway. In the southern hemisphere, they are known as the Aurora Australis and can often be mirror-like images that occur at the same time as in the north. Clear winter nights tend to be better for observing the sky due to less haze and water vapour in the air. The colour of the aurora depends on which gas - oxygen or nitrogen - is being generated by the electrons. It also depends on how fast the electrons are moving. As well as Earth, any planet with a magnetic eld and an atmosphere should have auroras, including Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.","Captured by by astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore aboard the ISS .

"Tim Cook has hit out at the sedentary lifestyle of many people, claiming that sitting is terrible for your health -and that the upcoming Apple Watch can help. While addressing a Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, the Apple CEO said 'a lot of doctors believe sitting is the new cancer.' Cook revealed he's been using his Apple smartwatch to remind him to get up and move every hour. 'Sitting is the new cancer': Apple CEO made a startling statement while plugging the soon to be released Apple Watch . 'If I sit for too long, it will actually tap me on the wrist to remind me to get up and move, because a lot of doctors think sitting is the new cancer,' said Cook. 'Ten minutes before the hour, it will remind you to move. We have a lot of people using the Apple Watch at Apple, and ten minutes before the hour, suddenly they all get up and move. 'It took a little to get used to, but it's great.' The $349 must-have gadget starts shipping in April. Cook made the announcement just as Apple became the first company to reach a market value of $700 billion. Shares rose 1.9 percent to close at $122.02, lifting Apple's market value to $710 billion, and making it the first company to hit the $700 billion milestone. Cook, speaking at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference, said Apple was hitting its stride. 'We've taken (the mobile operating system) iOS and extended it into your car, into your home, into your health. All of these are really critical parts of your life,' Cook said. 'We want one seamless kind of life. 'And so, I think that is huge for our future...We also did a lot of things to further our global footprint. And so, if you look at what we've done in China, we've opened more stores there. 'We've opened a lot more distribution there. Through the world, we've opened almost 20,000 new points of sale. As several recent studies have discovered, sitting for too long can be as dangerous to health as smoking. It more than doubles your risk of diabetes and is linked with an increase in heart disease. In fact, inactivity is the fourth biggest killer of adults, according to the World Health Organisation. But the scariest thing of all? The results are the same however much exercise people do when they're not sitting down. 'Most people think that if they work out every day that's all they need to do,' says researcher Dr Emma Wilmot, whose team at the University of Leicester analysed 18 studies incorporating a total of 800,000 people. 'But those with jobs that require sitting all day may still be at risk. 'When we sit for long periods of time, enzyme changes occur in our muscles that can lead to increased blood sugar levels. The effects happen very quickly, and regular exercise won't fully protect you.' The widely anticipated first Apple 'wearable' will likely start shipping in April, Cook said . The U.S. tech giant recently posted record revenue of $74.6 billion (£49.2bn) for the three months to December 31, outstripping the quarterly GDP of Israel, Greece or Denmark. Apple's cash pile is now $178 billion (£117bn), the equivalent to $556 for every American and bigger than the £95billion budget for Britain's National Health Service. Its landmark performance was driven by record-breaking sales for its iPhone 6 and 6 plus, with the firm revealing it sold 34,000 handsets every hour for the entire quarter. 'We've opened 27 new Apple Stores, lot of flagship stores.' Cook said Apple took some $50 billion in revenue in emerging markets over the past calendar year. Brian White, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the leading tech company has even more room to grow. 'Given Apple's powerful iPhone cycle, a big 4G ramp in China and the upcoming launch of Apple Watch in April, we believe there is still plenty to look forward to at Apple during this transformational cycle,' he said in a note to clients. 'At the same time, we believe Apple's valuation has room to expand from depressed levels.' Apple shares remain valued at reasonable levels, according to analysts, because of the whopping $18 billion quarterly profit reported recently by the iPhone and iPad maker. Using the price-earnings ratio favored by Wall Street, Apple is valued at around 16 times its annual earnings, but Fitzgerald said the value was only around 10 times the projected earnings for the next fiscal year. Apple is far ahead in market value from the number two company, oil giant Exxon Mobil, worth some $382 billion at the market close. Historic first: Apple on Tuesday became the first company in history to reach a market value of $700 billion . The record Apple quarterly profit -- on unprecedented revenue of $74.6 billion -- was driven by the sale of 74.5 million iPhones, well ahead of most analysts' expectations. Analysts are also seeing expanded adoption of the Apple Pay system that enables customers to purchase items with a tap of their iPhone, and many predict strong demand for the Apple Watch set for release in April. Separately, Apple agreed to commit $848 million for solar energy to power its data centers, according to a statement from First Solar, Inc. Cook called the effort 'our biggest, boldest, and most ambitious project ever' and said it was part of Apple's commitment on clean energy and corporate responsibility.","The Apple CEO says his smartwatch is set to vibrate intermittently to remind him to get up and move around .

"A 75-year-old man helped in the arrest of a shoplifting suspect at a Pennsylvania mall by tackling him and threatening to break his arm if he tried to escape. Charlie Burton, of Fombell, says he was a vendor at the Washington Crown Center mall for a gun show when he saw an officer struggling with the suspect, 29-year-old Jonathan Fekete Jr. Police say Fekete was trying to get away after taking $200 worth of clothes from a Macy's store Saturday. Still got it: Charlie Burton, of Fombell, says he was a vendor at the Washington Crown Center mall for a gun show when he saw an officer struggling with the suspect, 29-year-old Jonathan Fekete Jr., and jumped in to help . Suspect Jonathan Fekete Jr., 29, was tackled by Burton after allegedly taking $200 worth of clothes from a Macy's store Saturday at a mall where a gun show was being held . Burton says he ran over to help, grabbed the man's arms and forced him down. Burton says, 'He started hollering his arm hurt, and I said, 'Quit struggling or I'll break the thing.'' Burton told the Observer-Reporter: . 'It happened so quickly...I just grabbed his arm and started twisting it. The security guard had him by the other arm and was trying to take him down. 'It was quite a tangle with the fella because he was so strong. I don't think anyone could've taken him down by themselves...He kept telling me to stop twisting his arm. I wonder what he'd do if he knew one of the people he was tussling with was twice his age.' In attendance at the gun show north of Pittsburgh was state Senator Camera Bartolotta, who commended Burton on her Facebook. 'I have to give a huge shout-out to Charlie (or Super Charlie!)' she wrote. 'How dumb do you have to be to shoplift in a mall completely packed with sportsmen?' the lawmaker wondered. 'Half the people in the mall were packing.' Fekete is jailed. Court records don't list an attorney. However, the Bellaire, Ohio man, it turned out, had one outstanding Pennsylvania warrant in connection with an Allegheny County drug charge. Of course, Burton had no way to know anything about Fekete. 'My wife asked me if I was nuts,' Burton said. 'But I would have felt bad if the officer got hurt.'","Show vendor Charlie Burton of Fombell was at the Washington County Sportsmen's Show on Saturday when he saw a scuffle .

"An infant has become infected with measles after his parents took him to Disneyland, the site believed to be at the center of a recent outbreak caused by unvaccinated children. Ariel and Christopher Loop, from Pasadena, California, took their baby Mobius to the theme park in Anaheim in mid-January, thinking that problems with measles publicized in December had been fixed. The Southern California amusement center is thought to be the source of an outbreak that has affected 122 people. Scroll down for video . Four-month-old Mobius Loop, pictured, developed the measles rash after being taken to Disneyland in mid-January, the center of the disease's recent outbreak . The sudden emergence of the disease is concerning -it was officially eliminated from the United States in 2000 due to widespread vaccination programs against it. The Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine (MMR) is normally not administered to children until they are one year old. Mrs Loop, a registered nurse, was having trouble putting Mobius, named after the mathematical shape, to bed when the child first showed signs of having measles, according to CBS LA. 'And then the next morning when he woke up, he was super hot and he had the bumps on his chest and the back of his head,' she said. The family rushed to the hospital, where they were put into a special negative-pressure room. Tests confirmed that Mobius had measles, and had been contagious for four days before he and his parents entered quarantine. Mobius's mother Ariel Loop (right) said she and husband Christopher (left) first noticed something may be wrong when her baby was having trouble getting to sleep . Disneyland in Anaheim, California, is thought to be the center of a measles outbreak that has affected more than 120 people . Mrs Loop, a registered nurse, said that her child may have exposed hundreds to the disease before the family was quarantined for eight days . 'We went out to eat twice, ran countless errands, and have potentially infected other kids who are too young to have to go through this. That kills me. And might kill one of them,' his mother said on Facebook. She estimated that hundreds of children could have been exposed to the disease during the short time. Mobius's story went viral and attracted the attention of anti-vaccine advocates, who say that the immunizations are harmful and may cause autism, despite a lack of hard scientific evidence. Mr Loop responded to the the critics by saying he was focusing on treating his son, who had 'a hacking cough that would put many smokers with a cold to shame'. A family friend, Dr Donavan Freberg, said that 'The completely illogical and deeply paranoid fears of the anti-vaxxers who selfishly put Mobius at risk.' Mr Loop said that his son had 'a hacking cough that would put many smokers with a cold to shame' when debating anti-vaccine advocates on social media . Large measles outbreaks in recent years have been linked to populations that have not received the MMR vaccine . Mrs Loop was also on watch for possible pneumonia during her child's battle with the disease. The family was in quarantine for the eight days leading up to Monday, during which Mobius made a full recovery. 'I understand that vaccines are scary. Having to hold him tight while a stranger hurts him is hard. Having three people hold him still to get the blood to test him for measles, however, was infinitely harder,' Mrs Loop said. A Center for Disease Control statement said that it has been dealing with a large, ongoing multi-state outbreak since the beginning of the year. Though the vast majority of cases are in California, 18 states and Washington DC had seen cases as of Tuesday. Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington have seen patients with measles. Political figures have weighed in on the issue of vaccination, with President Barack Obama saying that there is 'no reason' for all parents not to have their children immunized. The year 2014 saw a record number of measles cases, with 644 patients across 27 states. Last year had one major outbreak that consisted of 383 cases in the unvaccinated Ohio Amish community. The US normally sees less than 100 measles cases a year. The majority of measles cases have been in California. The CDC has updated its information on the disease's spread and now 18 states are affected .","Mobius Loop, from Pasadena, California, caught measles after attending park .

"An 11-year-old accusing of beating a tiny baby so badly she died allegedly invited her for a sleepover on the night she died. The unnamed suspect, who has been charged with the murder of two-month-old Zuri Whitehead, is said to have asked her mother to secure the fatal visit last Thursday in Wickliffe, Ohio. Whitehead's mother, Trina, said the suspect's parent called her around 9:30pm that evening and asked whether she wanted them to take the child off her hands for the night. 'Invited her over': The unidentified 11-year-old girl, pictured above in Lake County Juvenile Court, Ohio, allegedly invited over the two-month-old baby she is accused of beating to death . Brutalized: Zuri Whitehead, pictured, was badly beaten while the suspect's mother was sleeping on a couch. Her massive injuries did not kill her immediately, but she died hours later during surgery . The next morning, Zuri's bloodied body was rushed to hospital, where tests confirmed that she died of repeated, brutal blows to the head. She suffered massive brain injuries, severe damage to the liver, spleen and kidneys, and extensive internal bleeding, police said. The eleven-year-old, who is being held in a juvenile detention center, was on a couch with her 39-year-old mother and Zuri until 3am, when her mother fell asleep. Death scene: Zuri received her fatal injuries around 3:30am at this house in  Wickliffe, Ohio . By 3:30am she had awoken to the sight of her child holding the battered infant. Police say the suspect had gone upstairs with Zuri - and by the time she came back the damage had been done. Zuri was still alive then - though she struggled to open her eyes and had trouble breathing. She died during surgery at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland. Trina Whitehead also said that the 11-year-old's mother was her best friend, and that she had no reason to suspect anything untoward would happen. It had earlier been reported that the sleepover was offered to Whitehead, who has three other children, to give her a break for the evening.

"The woman at the centre of the Francis Abbott scholarship scandal has landed an internship with the Australian Greens after beating out more than 160 applicants for the job. Freya Newman escaped a jail sentence in November after she pleaded guilty to accessing details of Ms Abbott's $60,000 scholarship at the Whitehouse Institute of Design. Newman then leaked these documents to journalists and led to the intense media scrutiny of how the prime minister's daughter landed the merit. Scroll down for video . Freya Newman (pictured) has landed a job with the Australian Greens in Senator Lee Rhiannon's office . Newman pleaded guilty in November to accessing the files about a $60,000 Whitehouse Design Institute scholarship given to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's daughter Frances (pictured) in 2011 . NSW Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon confirmed Newman would be starting her two-day-per-week, paid internship in April. And it seems Newman is extremely eager to start her new role as part of one of Australia's major political parties. 'I'm really excited to be working with Senator Rhiannon and the rest of her staff this year on issues like higher education, aid and animal welfare,' she told Buzzfeed Australia. But her part in the Frances Abbott scandal did not sway the senator's decision to hire Newman for the Sydney-based position. 'In November 2014, my office opened applications for a part-time, paid internship position,' Senator Rhiannon said via an email statement. 'Following an extensive application process involving over 160 applicants and two rounds of interviews we offered the position to Freya. 'Freya was an outstanding applicant and we are very much looking forward to having her on board.' The news caused controversy because the institute's chairman Les Taylor is a friend of Frances Abbott's father, Prime Minister Tony Abbott . Newman was handed a two-year good behaviour bond in Sydney after she leaked files to the media . The emergence of the leaked documents sparked widespread protests as it raised questions about how Ms Abbott landed her scholarship as the institute's chairman, Les Taylor, is a friend of Prime Minister Tony Abbott and donor to the Liberal Party. While handing down her sentence in November, Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan said she did not think Newman was 'motivated by a sense of injustice, rather than notoriety... or greed'. Ms Newman faced a maximum custodial sentence of two years imprisonment. Ms O'Sullivan said Ms Newman's offence was at the 'lowest end' of the scale and told a courtroom cramped with media and supporters that the university communications student had 'good prospects of rehabilitation'. Supporters gathered outside Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney, calling for Newman to be 'freed', as she was sentenced inside . Frances Abbott, pictured left with Tony and Margie Abbott and her sisters, attended the Whitehouse Institute of Design (right) But while the magistrate added that Ms Newman's actions had done harm to the community and the victim, she told the court the  university student had not accessed sensitive documents, just material that was not in the public domain. 'She made no attempt to conceal her actions and resigned from the institution the following day,' the magistrate said. Ms O'Sullivan said other Whitehouse staff members had briefed Ms Newman in how she could access documents that detailed Ms Abbott's scholarship by using another staff member's log-in. Isolated protesters held up placards of support for Newman and condemnation of the Abbott family prior to the hearing.","Senator Lee Rhiannon confirmed Freya Newman had landed an internship with the Greens .

"This week, Canberra university student Louise Stockton has a lot of bills to pay. The 25-year-old has expensive text books to buy and a large gas bill she will need to get a payment extension for. In order to make ends meet, twice a week Ms Stockton goes diving in dumpsters for food. 'I really don't have that much money this week and if I can find a couple of loaves of bread it's going to make my week a lot easier,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Canberra students are increasingly turning to 'dumpster diving' for food for financial and ethical reasons . Canberra university student Louise Stockton goes dumpster diving for food twice a week . Dumpster divers say they find plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and bread . 'If I'm going to find some heads of broccoli I can make some good meals this week. 'It means I can spend money on other things I need to buy.' For Ms Stockton, student allowances from Centrelink and money from her casual job don't provide enough security. 'Centrelink payments can provide for the basics but there are variables,' she said. 'When you have to pay for unexpected medical costs or any sort of emergency comes up it's really hard to find the money to account for them. 'It's not as reliable as I think people seem to think that it is.' She is one of a growing number of people turning to dumpster diving for financial, environmental and ethical reasons. For Ms Stockton, student allowances from Centrelink and money from her casual job don't provide security . In winter students also pick up roast chickens, milk and yoghurt but they steer clear in the summer . Ms Stockton said the amount of fresh food she is able to find is incredible, and worth the risks . Ms Stockton says it's not without risk – she has come across used needles and broken glass while searching in large metal bins at odd hours of the night. 'When you're going through a dark alley at night you're not really sure what's going to be there,' she said. Another Canberra student, Steve Skitmore, lives in community housing with 30 other students and as a co-op a large proportion of the food they eat comes from dumpster diving . 'You have to be very careful, a lot of the time shop keepers see this as threatening their business, you know the idea that not buying something is taking something away from them. 'The way I see it you're not able to buy those products anyway.' But Ms Stockton said the amount of fresh food she is able to find is incredible, and worth the risks. 'Bread is the most commonly thrown thing,' she said. 'After that lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. 'Anything that is probably fine to eat but doesn't look as pretty as it once did, you give it a wash and you cook it.' Another Canberra student, Steve Skitmore, lives in community housing with 30 other students and as a co-op a large proportion of the food they eat comes from dumpster diving. In addition to the financial benefits, Mr Skitmore dumpster dives for environmental reasons. 'It's an understanding of the amount of waste that comes out of the industrial food industry,' he said. 'And the actual act of intervening within the amount of waste that comes in that. 'You get so much incredible stuff, and it's all edible as long as you're working along safety lines.' The 27-year-old archaeology student said a Facebook page they set up for Canberra dumpster divers a few months ago had amassed followers 'exponentially' as more people turn to bins as a food source. 'The main reason we do it is we get so much fresh fruit and vegetables, which are pretty expensive when you buy it every few days,' Mr Skitmore said. 'A lot of really high-end stuff, that's the stuff the supermarkets don't sell that much of, like gourmet heirloom carrots. 'In winter we go for the meat and dairy which is also there in the summer but it's not food safe in the summer.' Mr Skitmore said they also get plenty of herbs, potatoes, onions, hot roasted chickens, milk and gourmet yoghurts. The 27-year-old archaeology student said a Facebook page they set up for Canberra dumpster divers a few months ago had amassed followers 'exponentially' as more people turn to bins as a food source . Two nights a week the group travels to shops in the centre of Canberra to dumpster dive. He has lived and dumpster dived in other cities, including Brisbane, but said it is particularly easy in the nation's capital. 'We go there because the managers of those shops are really pretty supportive,' Mr Skitmore said. 'They are pretty onto knowing people are going through there so they make sure it's on top of layered cardboard. 'Compared to the bigger cities Canberra has a lot more understanding, there's a lot of pressure on students here. 'The rent's really high and there's limited housing available for students.'","Canberra students increasingly turning to 'dumpster diving' for food .

"Boris Johnson last night urged David Cameron to bring forward plans for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. The London Mayor, one of the leading contenders to succeed the PM as Tory leader, said that a speedy decision would be positive for Britain and Europe. Speaking on a tour of the US, Mr Johnson said: ‘Let’s get it done.’ The Prime Minister has announced plans to give voters their first say on Britain’s place in Europe since 1975 if the Conservatives remain in power. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson, pictured, advised David Cameron to fast-forward his planned EU referendum . He has pledged to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels and then hold an in/out referendum by the end of 2017. The commitment has become a key election battleground, since Labour has set its face against a referendum. Downing Street has dismissed the idea that it has secretly been planning to bring the vote forward to next year if Mr Cameron remains in office. However, during a G20 finance ministers summit in Turkey, Chancellor George Osborne hinted that the date might be brought forward. He said the Prime Minister would be ‘delighted’ if he could complete renegotiation of the UK’s EU membership earlier. Mr Johnson said: ‘I very much welcome the idea of bringing forward the renegotiation and the referendum. ‘Let’s get it done. We should stress that this is something that can be very positive, not just for Britain but for the whole of Europe and indeed for investors in Europe because a reformed Europe will deliver growth and prosperity. Get it done, get the change, get it done, put it to the people.’ David Cameron warned business leaders yesterday that his planned EU referendum was required otherwise the UK would 'drift towards the exit' and the poll would be based on his renegotiation of the agreement . Mr Cameron yesterday warned that public scepticism about the EU meant that Britain would ‘drift towards the exit of the EU’ unless a referendum was held. Addressing the annual conference of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) in London, the Prime Minister insisted that firms were backing his plan to hold a referendum after renegotiating the terms of Britain’s membership. ‘They are saying it is quite right to have a strategy that gives Britain the best chance of staying in a reformed European Union that works in our interest and that is what my approach is,’ he said. ‘Let’s get stuck in there, let’s hold a negotiation, let’s deal with those things that are holding Britain back, and then let’s have this put to the British public in an in/out referendum.’ A Downing Street source said: ‘We have always said we want a referendum by the end of 2017, and there is no secret plan to hold it next year.

"A long-lost Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece thought to be worth £90million and discovered in a bank vault is finally being returned to Italy. The painting of Renaissance socialite Isabella d’Este, attributed by experts to da Vinci, was seized by police after being found in a bank vault in Switzerland in 2013. Investigators said the piece had been exported illegally and was in danger of being sold on to an investment fund in the UK. Scroll down for video . Rediscovered: Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of Isabella d'Este, which was seized by Swiss police after it was found in a bank vault in the country in 2013 and is now finally being returned to Italy . The portrait, which had been missing for centuries, was uncovered among 400 pieces of art stored in the vault. But in a further twist, when art police ruled the painting had been exported illegally and went to the vault to seize it, they found it had gone missing again. Incredibly, it surfaced for a second time last year during a car insurance fraud, when Italian police discovered a lawyer was trying to negotiate its sale for £90million. Prosecutor Manfredi Palumbo said: ‘As part of a separate insurance fraud investigation came to know that an Italian lawyer in Pessaro had been made the agent to tell a painting attributed to da Vinci for no less than 95 million euros (£70m). ‘Just before we seized it we discovered that the lawyer was in negotiations to sell the painting to a UK fund for 120 million euros (£90m).’ ‘Once it arrives back in Italy, we will conduct further investigations to establish who really owns the work.’ Genius: Da Vinci, left, also painted the world famous Mona Lisa, right. Carlo Pedretti of the University of California said tests showed there were ‘no doubts’ that the latest portrait was the work of da Vinci . Experts have attributed the painting to Da Vinci using carbon dating and pointing to a 1499 pencil sketch of the noblewoman that hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The pigments are the same and the priming of the canvas is prepared according to his recipe. Carlo Pedretti, an expert in Leonardo studies at the University of California, said the tests showed there were ‘no doubts’ that the portrait was the work of da Vinci. However other experts have cast doubt on the authenticity saying that it could have been completed by his students.","Portrait of Isabella d'Este was found in a family box in a vault in 2013 .

Almost every person who walked through the doors got an embrace from the First Lady, as screenshots from a live stream reveal. One remarked on her height, commenting: 'You're so tall!' Surprising a White House tour has become something of a tradition for the First Lady. 'At least once a year I try to surprise a tour,' Mrs Obama told one tourist during an approximately half-hour appearance shown on the White House website. Ms Bush Hager, who was at the White House to interview Mrs Obama for the Today show, gave out her fair share of hugs too. The White House announced that the nearly 200-year-old Old Family Dining Room would be opened to the public for the first time this morning. Hugs all round: There was just one thing the visitors wanted from Mrs Obama on meeting her . More hugs... Almost every person who walked through the doors got an embrace from the First Lady . The room was recently refurbished and will be a showcase for 20th century art and design. The Old Family Dining Room is a smaller dining room off the State Dining Room on the first floor. It was created by President John Quincy Adams in 1825 as a place for the first family to eat meals, White House curator William Allman wrote on the White House blog. After the family's dining room was moved upstairs to the private residence, presidents used the Old Family Dining Room for small official meals, including working luncheons with foreign heads of state, Allman said. Obama also has used the room for an annual Passover seder. Before the renovation, the Old Family Dining Room had sunny yellow walls and drapery and a light-toned rug edged in blue underneath the dining table.

"A jury intently watched the videotaped confession on Tuesday of a man accused of murdering Etan Patz in 1979 and heard him say he choked the six-year-old boy and 'just couldn't let go'. Pedro Hernandez, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, admitted in hours of video to choking Etan, shoving his body in a plastic bag and dumping it with some curbside trash a few blocks away. In the courtroom, Hernandez, 54, saw himself on a large screen near the jury tell law enforcement he lured the boy to the basement of the Soho deli in New York City where he worked and kill him. His attorney maintains that the confession is fiction, dreamed up by a mentally ill man. Scroll down for video . Stanley Patz, the father of Etan Patz, pictured on Tuesday entering the murder trial of Pedro Hernandez at Manhattan Supreme Court in New York. Jurors were shown the videotaped confession of the man accused of killing his six-year-old son today . 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me,' Hernandez said in the video. 'I don't know what to say. Something just took over me, and I was just choking him.' Hernandez was a teenage stock clerk at a convenience store a few blocks from where Etan was last seen on his way to school on May 25, 1979. It was Etan's first time walking to school alone. 'I don't know why I came up to him,' Hernandez says on the tape, calmly. 'I just approached to him, and I asked him: ''You want a soda?'' 'He didn't say nothing to me, even when I was choking him. He didn't kick. He didn't do nothing. He just kind of stood there, and I just felt bad what I did.' The boy went limp, but was still alive when he disposed of the body, he said. 'He was still gasping,' Hernandez said on the videotape. The next day, he returned to the alley to look for the body but it was gone. 'I was going to throw it away in the garbage if it was still there,' Hernandez said during the taped confession. Pedro Hernandez, pictured in 2012, was seen confessing to the murder of Etan Patz (right) in a videotaped confession show to the jury in court on Tuesday . Hernandez said had never met Etan or his family before the killing. The interview took place from 2.15am until 7.15am on Thursday morning, May 24, 2012. That was about a month after authorities began a highly-publicized excavation of the basement of a Soho building in an effort to crack the cold case. Etan's father, Stanley Patz and sister Shirea sat in court as the jury was transfixed by the videotaped confession, which the defense said was coerced by police from a mentally ill man who suffers from hallucinations. On the videotape, an investigator asked Hernandez what happened after he left Patz. 'I just feel like nothing, like nothing happened, like I didn't do nothing wrong,' Hernandez said. 'I know that I did something wrong, but it didn't bother me that much. I just kept working.' On the videotape, he described three previous confessions to the killing, including one to his first wife, who he told: 'I killed someone and it was a child.' Hernandez also said he confessed to a lifelong friend and a New Jersey church group. 'We were holding hands, praying,' he said on the videotape. 'I told everybody that I killed somebody.' Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to killing Etan, whose body has never been found. Stanley Patz, pictured with his daughter Shira Patz at court in New York City on Tuesday. Miss Patz has maintained absolute privacy since her brother's disappearance in 1979, to the extent that it is not known why she is in a wheelchair . The six-year-old's disappearance prompted an international search and spurred major changes in how law enforcement nationwide handle missing children reports. He was one of the first missing children whose picture appeared on a milk carton. In the tape, Hernandez also spoke about being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and taking medication for pain from an on-the-job injury from working at a dress factory in New Jersey. The confession was played in September during a hearing on whether it could be used at trial. Some personal details about Hernandez's life were removed after his attorney objected.

Specifically, they want to send a submarine to Titan's largest northern sea, Kraken Mare. Sprawling over 154,000 square miles (400,000 square km), and around 300 metres (1,000 feet) deep, Kraken Mare is comparable in size to the Great Lakes in North America.

Titan's atmosphere is largely made up of nitrogen and methane at a pressure one and half times that of Earth's, and with a temperature of -290 °F (-179 °C). The space agency said the submarine would be driven by a 1kW radiothermal Stirling generator that would propel the craft and also prevent it from freezing. 'The vehicle would observe – and perhaps ultimately exploit - tidal currents in the sea, which follow a cycle once per Titan day, or 16 Earth days,' the researchers write in the design proposal.

If Kraken Mare is as deep as estimated, it could cause the proposed nitrogen ballast tanks to could condense into a liquid, making the craft sink. Nasa has planned for this, and says a piston would enable liquid to pass liquid in and out, rather than simply relying air pressure. The mission would primarily look for traces of compounds that could give scientists a better understanding of how life began on Earth. 'We will investigate a full spectrum of oceanographic phenomena: chemical composition of the liquid, surface and subsurface currents, mixing and layering in the 'water' column, tides, wind and waves, bathymetry, and bottom features and composition,' said Nasa. 'Measurements of all these aspects of Titan's hydrocarbon ocean environment can only be made through focused in situ exploration with a well-instrumented craft.

"A children's book by an anti-vaccination campaigner is being mocked in satirical online book reviews, which ridicule the author for telling kids that the measles is fun. Many people would assume that the book ‘Melanie’s Marvellous Measles’ is a joke, considering the disease is responsible for killing 145,000 people every year. However the picture book, which recounts a child’s lovely day whilst suffering from the measles, is entirely serious about its anti-vaccination agenda. The joke is now on the author, Brisbane-based campaigner Stephanie Messenger, who is now being bombarded with scathing book reviews on Amazon. Internet users are posting satirical book review to openly mock a a book by an Australian anti-vaccination advocate, titled 'Melanie's Marvellous Measles' Messenger says the aim of her book is to 'educate children on the benefits of having measles and how you can heal from them naturally and successfully.' She urges parents not to vaccinated their children, claiming that 'history has shown us that these diseases are quite benign and, according to natural health sources, beneficial to the body.' The characters in the book echo Messenger's message, with one character telling her child: . 'For most children it is a good thing to get the measles. Many wise people believe measles make the body stronger and more mature for the future.' One star: A comment points out that measles is one of the leading causes of death amongst young children . The Internet has responded, with some people even sarcastically thanking Messenger. 'As a carpenter who specializes in itty bitty coffins I can't say enough good things about this book, my customer base has been growing at an epidemic rate!' wrote one commenter, referencing the alarming number of children's deaths due to the measles. He was one of only a few people to give the book a five star review, albeit insincere. However, one woman enthusiastically praised the book as one of her favourites of all time. 'This is just a wonderful book in every way. I wouldn't have thought that anything could be as beautiful and heart-warming as ""Peter's Pancreatic Cancer"" or ""Andy's Amazing Auto Accident"" but I'm now convinced. 'Up there with ""Smoke Yourself Thin"" among my favourite books of all time.' This book review points out the disastrous and permanent impact of measles on some children . Of the 1114 reviews, the book has received a whopping 872 one star ratings, with many disappointed commenters asking 'why can't I give this book zero stars?' Some people claimed that the book doesn't cater for the disabilities their child now suffers after contracting the measles. 'My infant daughter went blind after contracting measles from an unvaccinated child,' began one commenter. 'Yet there's no braille version of this wonderful book for me to give her someday to explain to her how awesome the disease that took her sight away is.' 'I'm so happy I bought a hard copy version of this book,' wrote another delighted customer. 'If I bought an audiobook, I never would have gotten my money's worth as both of my daughters went deaf from Measles Encephalitis. 'They now have a great book and a lifelong disability to remind them how much I truly love them!' Adam Richards compiles a list of possibly the most disturbing children's books ever . Some bookworms gave recommendations for other books people might enjoy if they are a fan of 'Melanie's Marvellous Measles'. 'Check out other titles for children like: ""Let's Put Plastic Bags on our Heads"", ""Baby Needs A Cigarette"", ""Seatbelts Are For Losers"" and ""Baby's First Pistol."" 'Almost, but not quite as good as ""Belinda the Bio-terrorist"". 'But I am looking forward to ""Melanie, The Neighborhood Pariah""; and ""So Many Funerals: A Children's Counting Book"",' commented another. Uncomfortable satire: The morbid posts use satire to point out how the book uses a light-hearted tone to share a very serious message . Some more worrying posts were from parents who expressed their relief after taking learning some valuable information from the compelling read. 'Finally! A children's book with an agenda I can get behind! I always thought I loved kids until I actually had one of my own and boy was I wrong!' wrote one particularly concerning parent. 'I researched anything and everything I could possibly do to get rid of the little brat, but I didn't want to be arrested for murder and childhood cancer is just too darn unpredictable.' Messenger is dedicated to her cause, claiming that in modern society 'we are being bombarded with messages from vested interests to fear all diseases in order for someone to sell some potion or vaccine. 'In fact, history shows that in industrialized countries, these diseases are quite benign and, according to natural health sources, beneficial to the body.' The measles vaccination is credited for a 75% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2013.","A book titled 'Melanie's Marvellous Measles' is being widely criticised .

"A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson's whereabouts, MailOnline can reveal. Officer Wilson, 28, has been in hiding on paid leave ever since he gunned down unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18, on 9 August. Now, in one of a series of incendiary tweets the RbG Black Rebels have stated, 'We are paying $5k cash for location of Ofc. Darren Wilson. Real $, no joke, no crime we just wana get his photo an ask him a few questions.' And though the RbG Black Rebels insist this is not a bounty on the officer's head, the chilling offer is set in the context of a stream of violent online posts boasting of 'combat experience', 'stockpiling' ammunition, cleaning out gun stores and being #WarReady. Scroll down for video . The incendiary tweet from the group: part of a twitter feed which includes references to 'war ready' which is likely to increase tensions in Ferguson ahead of the expected grand jury verdict on the shooting of Michael Brown by police office Darren Wilson . The 'Black Rebels' have used their Twitter feed to claim the police are preparing for 'war' when the grand just verdict is announced, which could be as early as Wednesday . Pointed: The feed includes a reference to ammunition which will 'solve a lot of problems'. The FBI has already warned that extremist violence is 'likely'. Typical of the reponse elicited by the offer is one follower's demand, '@BlackRebels_Stl@OpFerguson Yank that bastard off the street. He is a murderer running free still.' Governor Jay Nixon has already declared a State of Emergency and called in the National Guard in anticipation of the violence that FBI agents have described as 'inevitable' when the Grand Jury charged with deciding the fate of Officer Wilson, 28, delivers their verdict. Having promised that a decision would be reached 'by late November' it now seems likely that the Grand Jury will return that decision this week. A series of Grand Jury leaks, and Missouri law which allows officers to use lethal force if they believe their life to be in danger, have led many to believe that Wilson will not be indicted on murder charges as Brown's family and supporters hope. It is three months since Wilson pumped six bullets into the teenager as he walked down the middle of the road with a friend. In the wake of the shooting which ignited racial tension in the Missouri town rioters took to the streets armed with Molotov cocktails and chanting the slogan 'Hands Up Don't Shoot' - a reference to some witness accounts that the teenager had his hands up in surrender when Wilson fired off his fatal volley of shots. RbG Black Rebel's disturbing offer and tweets show the seething anger and hunger for violence among some agitators. They have no faith in the judicial system and seem intent on ignoring official calls for peaceful protest and calm. As reported by MailOnline that chatter has extended to St Louis own police officers. Writing on the forum St Louis Cop Talk one user writing under the username 'A Concerned Cop' advised residents, 'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family.' In what appeared to be a direct strike at Governor Nixon's decision to activate the National Guard rather than entrusting St Louis's own force with policing the streets of Ferguson, the user continued, 'It will be your responsibility to protect them. Our gutless commanders and politicians have neutered us. 'I'm serious, get a gun, get more than one, and keep one with you at all times.' Killed: Michael Brown, 18, (left) was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri. Pressure point: Protests on both sides of the argument over whether Darren Wilson should be charged with a crime for shooting unarmed Michael Brown have already started in Ferguson ahead of the grand jury verdict. So far all have been peaceful . Memorial: Michael Brown's high school graduation photo at one of the improvised memorials to his shooting more than three months ago. Speaking on Monday St Louis Mayor Francis Slay voiced support for Governor Nixon's decision to active the National Guard. He said that the Guard 'will be used in a secondary role' and could potentially be stationed at places such as shopping centers and government buildings. He said, 'The way we view this, the Guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on (the) front line interacting with demonstrators.' Gun sales have been said to be increasing. One gun shop owner, Steve King of Metro Shooting Supplies, in nearby Bridgeton, told the Washington Post sales had increased from a typical 30 or 40 firearms a week to 250 this week. 'These people are afraid.One hundred percent of them are buying because of Ferguson,' he said. When violence first exploded in Ferguson and cities across the states as the Michael Brown's shooting ignited underlying racial tensions in Missouri and beyond, the National Guard's intervention saw a visible reduction in violence. Missouri State Highway Patrol had initially been tasked with policing the protests when Governor Nixon first declared a state of emergency in August. Their tactics of enforcing curfews, lining up armored vehicles and attempting to drive protesters back with tear-gas and rubber bullets were widely criticized for only adding to tensions. Another of the incendiary tweets posted by the militant group . Flashpoint: Pattie Canter, a supporter of police officer Darren Wilson, argues with critics of the police in Ferguson at a demonstration yesterday. Larger protests are expected when the grand jury reach its verdict . Officers were clearly seen walking with guns un-holstered and raised towards unarmed protesters. The National Guard's strategy of working with community leaders and moving among protesters rather than drawing battle lines saw a marked drop in violence. According to reports based on unnamed sources in the St Louis Dispatch officer Wilson has told authorities that he realized that Brown and his friend matched the description of two youths involved in a theft at a convenience store just minutes before he saw them walking down the middle of the road. He has claimed that, having passed the teenagers whom he told not to walk in the middle of the road, he then doubled back and some sort of confrontation with Brown occurred at his police vehicle door. The reports state that Wilson claimed a struggle for his gun ensued resulting in him firing two shots and hitting Brown in the hand. When the youth tried to escape he allegedly stated that he continued to shoot, firing off the fatal volley of shots when Brown turned and 'charged' back towards him. This account is in stark contrast with that of several eye witnesses and Brown's companion who have claimed that the unarmed teen had his hands up, or by his side, and begged the officer 'Stop shooting.' St Louis Prosecutor Bob McCulloch's office have promised to unseal and release all evidence reviewed by the Grand Jury following its decision.","Self-described 'militant resistance' offers $5,000 to find where Wilson is .

'I don't have any specific plans. I have a lot of ideas. I have a lot of things in my head. We're going to have dinner on a school night with my family who I have heard from multiple sources are lovely people,' he added. 'You know, I'm not going to be here and try to sum up what this place has meant to be mover the years. I couldn't' do that. We got plenty of time.' Getting emotional he then said; 'What is this fluid? What are these feelings? Frankenstein angry!' He closed by saying; 'It's been an absolute privilege. It's been the honor of my professional life, and I thank you for watching it. For hate watching it. Whatever reason you were tuning in for.' 'For the better part of the last two decades, I have had the incredible honor and privilege of working with Jon Stewart. His comedic brilliance is second to none,' Michele Ganeless, President of Comedy Central, said in a statement. 'Jon has been at the heart of Comedy Central, championing and nurturing the best talent in the industry, in front of and behind the camera. Through his unique voice and vision, ‘The Daily Show’ has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come.' 'Jon will remain at the helm of The Daily Show’ until later this year,' she added. 'He is a comic genius, generous with his time and talent, and will always be a part of the Comedy Central family.' Steve Carell (left) and Olivia Munn (right) are just two of the A-list names who worked on The Daily Show . Stephen Colbert (above) left the show to host his own program on Comedy Central, The Colbert Report . Under Stewart, the show has won 18 Emmys, taking home the award for Best Variety Series every year from 2003 to 2012. It also won two Peabody Awards, for its election coverage in 2000 and 2004. The show has had two shows spin-off the program, The Colbert Report with Stephen Colbert and the recently debuted The Nightly Show with Larry Willmore. Another former corespondent, John Oliver, also hosts a similar news program on HBO, Last Week Tonight, which premiered last year. The show has also been the launching pad for many now A-list stars, including Ed Helms, Josh Gad, Olivia Munn, Rob Riggle, Rob Corddry and Steve Carell, who went on to star in The Office and was just nominated for an Oscar for his role in Foxcatcher. Stewart, 52, had hinted at his possible departure from this show starting late last year in interviews while promoting his directorial debut Rosewater. 'When do you decide that even though it's this place of great comfort and you feel like you're plugged into it like you've never been plugged into anything else that you've ever done, you know ... there are other considerations of family or even in the sense of just not wanting to be on television all the time' he told Terry Gross in an NPR interview. 'You know, you can't just stay in the same place because it feels like you've built a nice house there. And that's really the thing that I struggle with. And it is unclear to me.' He also tole The Hollywood Reporter when asked if he still enjoyed doing the show; 'Uh, yeah. I mean, like anything else, you do it long enough, you will take it for granted, or there will be aspects of it that are grinding. I can't say that following the news cycle as closely as we do and trying to convert that into something either joyful or important to us doesn't have its fraught moments. But there will come a point where I'm sure.' Stewart released his directorial debut Rosewater last year, and is seen with lead actor Gael Garcia Bernal . This as his contract, with a reported salary in the $25million to $35million range per year, is set to expire. There had also been talk of Stewart leaving when it was reported he was offered the hosting job on NBC's Meet the Press, something Stewart confirmed but a position he said he would never take. No doubt making this loss even more difficult for Comedy Central is that it comes on the heels of Colbert leaving his program to take over for the departing David Letterman on CBS's The Late Show. Almost immediately after the announcement was made, celebrities took to Twitter to pay tribute to Stewart's work on the show and state how upset they were to see him leaving. 'I KNEW WHEN JOHN STEWART LEFT TO DIRECT THAT MOVIE HE WAS GONNA TRY SOMETHING LIKE THIS,' joked Mindy Kaling. Former correspondent Gad wrote; 'Shocked & sad to see the man who gave me my big break on @TheDailyShow is ready to hang it up. #JonStewart can't wait to see what's next!' Piers Morgan also weighed in; 'Jon Stewart quitting? Good timing. He was beginning to be eclipsed by John Oliver. This way, he can leave on a high.' Craig Ferguson, who recently left his late night program, said; 'Congratulations to Jon Stewart on an extraordinary groundbreaking run.' Transparent actor and Togetherness creator Jay Duplass wrote; 'what will we do without you, Jon Stewart, oh captain our captain?' 'Washington is rigged for the big guys - and no person has more consistently called them out for it than Jon Stewart. Good luck, Jon!' said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Samantha Bee and Jason Jones (above) have already been rumored as possible replacements for Stewart . Jon Stewart and his wife Tracey have a son and a daughter (above) Stewart made his debut on the show January 11, 1999, taking over for original host Craig Kilborn. Prior to that he had hosted the critically praised but little seen The Jon Stewart Show on MTV and appeared in films including Playing by Heart, Big Daddy, Wishful Thinking and The Faculty. He also twice served as host of both the Grammys and the Oscars while working on The Daily Show. Stewart released two books while at The Daily Show, co-written with his correspondents and the show's writers, America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction and Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race. His audio recording of America won him a Grammy. Stewart married his wife Tracey in 2000, and the couple have a son and a daughter. Already there have been rumors about who might replace Stewart, with current correspondents and husband and wife Jason Jones and Samantha Bee being the most popular choice.","Jon Stewart announced he is leaving his job as host of The Daily Show during a taping of the program on Tuesday .

"Rescuers were forced to save a swan after ice formed around its beak when it fell asleep in a Chinese river where temperatures fell as low as minus eight. Stunned locals snapped the bizarre sight after spotting the bird swimming around in the water with ducks in the city of Korla in north western China's Xinjiang province. Yong Hsieh who went to feed the ducks with his wife spotted the swan after throwing bread in the water and realising it couldn't open its beak. The swan on the Kongque River in China, which had its beak frozen shut after falling asleep in a freezing river . The 27-year-old said: 'My wife and I had been having coffee in one of the riverside cafes when we decided to take a stroll along the river and feed the ducks. 'As we walked towards them we saw the swan but as soon as we got closer we noticed its beak was covered in ice. 'We threw some bread in and the ducks happily ate it up. But the swan couldn't even open its beak.' Worried that the bird would starve to death, Mr Yong called city officials who sent in a team from the Swan Guard. The Swan Guard are responsible for the feeding of hundreds of swans, which migrate to the Kongque River in Korla every winter from the Bayanbulak region, 250 miles away. Stunned locals snapped the bizarre sighting after spotting the bird in th water swimming around with ducks in the city of Korla in north western China's Xinjiang province . Swan Guard Sheng Liang added: 'I have been caring for swans for years and I admit that this is the first time I have every come across anything like this. 'We think it must have happened when she fell asleep with a wet beak. 'We managed to lure her towards us with some food and then took her to our swan house where we care for injured or sick swans. 'Once there, we put her in a warm room and waited for the ice to melt. Officials believe that the bird fell asleep in the river where temperatures reached as low as minus eight with a wet beak . 'Its lucky that we were informed because in these temperatures it's very unlikely that the ice would have melted if she had stayed outside. 'Once she could open her beak again we gave her a special treat of fish before taking her back to the river.' Temperatures have fallen so low in northern China lately even the sea has frozen, in some places up to 20 miles out from the shore.","Swan was spotted in a freezing Chinese river with its beak frozen shut .

"It may have been touted as the steamiest thing in Hollywood - but movie critics rounded on Fifty Shades of Grey for being too light on the sex. In a barrage of reviews published on Tuesday night, most of those who sat down with the raunchy adaptation ahead of its 13 February release date lamented its 'run-of-the-mill' lovemaking. One critic pointed out that sex only makes up 15 minutes of the two-hour runtime. Another pointed out that there are no visible genitals, no orgasms - and not that much nudity. Scroll down for video . Too many clothes? Movie critics remarked on how little sex there was in the film version of Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, above, as leads Ana Steele and Christian Grey . Pants on: One writer noted that Dornan spent much of the raunchy film with only his shirt off . Frustrated critics implied that the on-screen action between leads Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan left them unfulfilled, in contrast to EL James's notoriously explicit novels. Writing in USA Today, critic Claudia Puig said bluntly: 'Those looking for hot, kinky sex will be disappointed. Fewer than 15 of the movie's 125 minutes feature sex scenes. 'Discussion of contracts and objections over line items outweigh erotica. Even the graphic nudity grows numbing.' In Entertainment Weekly, freelance critic Lisa Schwarzbaum particularly noted Dorman's lack of on-screen exposure. 'Nobody in the movie has visible genitals', she said. 'Christian in particular seems to do a whole lot of stuff in the playroom with his shirt off but his pants on, which cannot be comfortable for such an active young man. 'But even more frustrating to voyeurs, nobody sweats, nobody strains, nobody loses control or even fakes losing control by simulating an orgasm.' More sweat, please: Writers seemed put out that the levels of nudity and sexual interaction on-screen did not match the steamy books by EL James . And, while the trappings and devices of kinky sex do exist in the film, another writer pointed out that they are not put to especially shocking use. The New York Daily News's Elizabeth Weitzman said: '..anyone hoping the movie would really push the S&M envelope may find Christian's tastefully shot toy room a little… vanilla. 'We see a whip here, a handcuff there, but nothing that would shock even newcomers to the series.' The Guardian describe Jamie Dornan's performance as 'adequate,' and reveal that the highly anticipated sex scenes only really serve to push the plot forward. Jordan Hoffman says: 'The sex scenes in Fifty Shades of Grey are numerous, lengthy and frank, but they aren’t smutty. 'Only occasionally does it dip into Red Shoe Diaries-territory. By and large, these key scenes really are there to advance the plot, and only the most buttoned-up prude will be scandalised.' 'Vanilla': Though whips, handcuffs and other BDSM paraphernalia are present in the film, it was implied they are not made much use of . Disappointment? Only 15 minutes of the two-hour-plus film are said to be sex . Justin Craig from Fox News described the film as medicore: 'Just how sexually explicit is “Fifty Shades of Grey?” It’s mild. 'Sure there’s plenty of nudity, but more salacious material is shown every day on cable. It’s not even close to late-night Cinemax. You’ll find more disturbing images in “Saw” or “Game of Thrones.” 'The mediocre plot, bland characters and tepid tone don’t do any favors. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson treats the movie as serious as a cadaver, which is truly a major disappointment.' A writer for the Associated Press coyly noted 'there is more scintillating material in a premium HBO show'. Lindsey Bahr said Fifty Shades was 'run of the mill' - drawing the comparison with sex-laden cable shows like Game of Thrones, or Lena Dunham's Girls, which is notoriously graphic and unsentimental when it comes to copulation. Josh Dickey at Mashable said: 'It's just kind of an above-average and brooding ""love"" story, not campy or clumsy enough to be so-bad-it's-good, not quite stylish or sizzling or steamy enough to overcome its atrocious source material.' Starting his review of the film by echoing many of the other critics sentiments: 'Here's a criticism of Fifty Shades of Grey you probably weren't expecting: There's not nearly enough sex in it. There was supposed to be a lot more.' Love story: Some critics have praised the romance of the film which sees Ana fall for Christian . However, while critics mainly said the film failed to perform sexually, praise was doled out for the film's storytelling and dialogue, which was characterized as more subtle and elegant than James's novels. Time Out New York writer David Ehrlich said: 'Substituting heartache for handcuffs, Fifty Shades is the rare studio romance in which the characters actually try to understand one another. 'As this is the first installment of an epic trilogy, how much there is beneath the surface remains to be seen, but Taylor-Johnson seems genuinely interested in finding out. Fifty Shades may not make you come, but you’ll still be glad you went.' Whilst Sheri Linden of the Hollywood Reporter revealed: 'It’s a slow build to the smutty bits, and one that’s disappointingly devoid of tension. 'Even so, the movie is, by definition, a stronger proposition than the book because it strips away the oodles of cringe-inducing descriptions and internal monologue that tip the text heavily toward self-parody. 'Things grow more compelling once Christian Grey whips out his nondisclosure agreement – along with a nice Pouilly-Fumé, naturally – and shows Ana his 'playroom', expertly outfitted with state-of-the-art S&M gear.' Similarly the Telegraph praised the film for stripping away the fat of the book transforming it into a sleek and watchable movie. Film critic Tim Robey says: 'Johnson’s timing and verve are terrific, and manage to upend the more distasteful indignities of the book in gold-spun-from-straw ways. 'It’s her rebellion, not just her submission, that this version of Christian finds attractive, which gives Dornan something more interesting, human, and contradictory to play as well. 'If Taylor-Johnson and James bitterly tussled for control over this material, it's a relief and even a bit of a thrill that the director came out on top.'","Critics said tame feature film, out on February 13, was 'run of the mill'

"Independent Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie believes 'halal money' may be funding terrorist groups and wants to introduce new Federal laws forcing anyone who has been certified to provide proof they are not sending financial support to the Middle East. The controversial senator questioned whether halal certification is leading to funds being sent through to militants in Syria and Iraq and is threatening to introduce a private senator's bill to stamp it out. It follows similar claims from Nationals MP George Christensen, who wrote that consumers who bought halal products could be funding Islamic extremism. Senator Jacqui Lambie has targeted the sale and proceeds of 'halal products' in a speech delivered in parliament questioning whether funds were being directed to terror groups overseas . 'Given that our enemies in Islamic State are receiving a steady cash-flow to control their caliphate in Syria and Iraq, why isn't there a legal requirement in Australia for halal certification fees to be disclosed?' Senator Jacqui Lambie asked . Senator Lambie claimed she was prompted to look into the issue after receiving hundreds of emails from concerned residents. A study the Tasmanian senator commissioned the parliamentary library to examine exposed some 'surprising facts' that alarmed her. Certifiers are not legally required to disclose their fees, nor is there a formal reporting or auditing system to ascertain whether funds are being misused, she said. 'Given that our enemies in Islamic State are receiving a steady cash-flow to control their caliphate in Syria and Iraq, why isn't there a legal requirement in Australia for halal certification fees to be disclosed?' Senator Lambie said. Two Federal politicans, Senator Lambie (l) and Nationals MP George Christensen (r) have questioned the proceeds of halal products . 'And given that our nation is on high terrorism alert, while hundreds of Australian Islamic State sympathisers are fighting our ADF forces in Iraq, why is there is no formal reporting or auditing mechanism in Australia to ascertain whether monies paid for halal certification are misused?' Senator Lambie warned if the government failed to answer her questions, she would introduce legislation to close such 'legal loopholes'. '(The loopholes) could allow financing of terrorists and Australia's enemies through halal money,' she said. Daily Mail Australia has contacted AUSTRAC, the government agency charged with tracking the funding of terror groups, for comment on Senator Lambie's claims. It comes as the federal government considers another wave of national security laws which could ban a range of groups that 'nurture extremism' such as Hizb ut-Tahrir .","Claims 'halal money' is being sent to militants in Iraq and Syria .

"Women are more likely than men to blame their partner for failings in their relationship, according to a new study. Researchers also found people who are unhappy in their romantic relationship spend more time during a disagreement thinking about how angry and frustrated they are, while happy couples coordinate their thoughts so that when one partner has many emotional thoughts, the other has few. Lead investigator Doctor Anita Vangelisti, professor of communication at the University of Texas, said: 'Among happy couples, when one partner is thinking a lot about disagreement or anger, the other instead may be thinking about how to understand his or her partner or how to resolve the conflict.' A new study found that women are the ones who pass the blame to their husbands when it comes to arguments (and most are about money and past relationships) She said the findings show that people's thoughts during a conflict situation reflect and shape their own relationship satisfaction and can even affect how happy their partner is. Dr Vangelisti and her colleagues studied 71 young unmarried heterosexual couples in Texas, who had been together an average of three years. Each person was encouraged to privately express his or her thoughts aloud to a researcher while in a separate room from the other partner and while communicating about a topic of conflict with the partner via a computer chat programme. The chat programme showed the person's typed messages in one section and the partner's replies and messages in another section, but did not display the person's vocalised thoughts, which were tape recorded. The researchers found that during a discussion involving conflict with a romantic partner, when one person thinks about making excuses or denying his or her role in the conflict, the other partner was likelier to be unhappy in the relationship . In most cases, the couples discussed a topic of disagreement that both participants had listed in a questionnaire about conflict issues. Before the study, they also completed a questionnaire about their relationship satisfaction. Topics of conflict included amount of time spent together, money, past dating relationships, alcohol use, and friends and relatives who disapproved of their relationship. The researchers told the couples they had 10 minutes to discuss the topic and come to a resolution. A researcher sat behind the participant in each room and reminded that study subject to voice his or her thoughts throughout the interaction. The researchers found that during a discussion involving conflict with a romantic partner, when one person thinks about making excuses or denying his or her role in the conflict, the other partner was likelier to be unhappy in the relationship than those whose partner did not 'stonewall.' People in unhappy relationships were more likely to be inflexible in their thinking and more interested in changing the subject of discussion. They also thought more about how repetitive the discussion felt. When both people in the relationship were dissatisfied, they were more likely to think about the power they had or their partner had in the relationship. They also were more likely to focus their thoughts on disagreement or emotions, such as anger and frustration, at the same time as their partner. Doctor Vangelisti said: 'We don't have data on what happens when partners change their thoughts, but our findings certainly do suggest that thinking about how angry and frustrated you are - or thinking about how much power is being wielded during a conflict - is not beneficial for the relationship.' She speculated that people's thoughts might affect their partner's relationship satisfaction because they often voice their thoughts to their partner or, in a real-life setting, they send non-verbal messages. When both people in the relationship were dissatisfied, they were more likely to think about the power they had or their partner had in the relationship . Unlike other studies, which found differences between men's and women's thoughts during disagreement, the current study found only one statistically significant sex-based difference in thoughts: women were more likely than men to blame their partner. Dr Vangelisti added: 'The results raise questions about widely accepted differences between women's and men's cognitions.' However, she warned that computer-aided interactions are not the same as face-to-face conversations because they do not give participants access to each other's expressions or tone of voice. The researchers concluded that participants' thoughts may therefore differ from those they might have during a face-to-face conflict. The findings were published online in the journal Communication Monographs.","Study by University of Texas .

"Beleaguered NBC anchor Brian Williams has finally been suspended without pay amid a firestorm of criticism over false claims he was inside a helicopter that was gunned down over Iraq. Williams, anchor and Managing Editor of the flagship Nightly News show, had been under fire for 11 days after being called out on the overblown story by indignant veterans of the 2003 invasion. Bosses at the network finally acted after deciding Williams's own decision to remove himself from anchoring for 'several days' was not enough. Scroll down for video . Suspended: Brian Williams's pay has been stopped for six months during the suspension. The decision was announced by the British president of NBC News, Deborah Turness, right, who has overseen a string of high-profile departures . Boots on the ground: Williams, pictured above covering Iraq, was pulled up by veterans on an overblown story of being aboard a helicopter hit by an RPG - which it emerged he was not on at all . In a note sent to NBC staff, Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, described his puffed-up retellings of events from 2003 as 'wrong and completely inappropriate'. In the mean time Lester Holt, who has already covered two broadcasts for Williams, will sit in the Nightly News anchor's chair. The scandal began on January 30, when Williams repeated an often-told anecdote about being on board a Chinook helicopter during the 2003 Iraq invasion. He said that he was on board a chopper which got hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and was forced to land. In fact, he was on a completely different helicopter. After being called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory-grabbing, Williams issued an on-air apology - and said he had been in a 'following' helicopter. This detail too came under scrutiny, and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind. Stand-in: Lester Holt, right, will fill the Nightly News anchor's chair while Williams is away . Dead body? Another Williams anecdote - of seeing a dead body float down a street in New Orleans's French Quarter during Hurricane Katrina, was also called into question . In danger? Williams also gave a contentious account of his time covering Israel's war with Hezbollah - once claiming there was rocket fire 'just underneath' the helicopter (above) he was riding in - a detail that was notably absent from his reporting at the time . Tough calls: Turness has been behind high-profile sackings at NBC . Deborah Turness, the Brit flown over to rescue NBC's news operation in 2013, has form when it comes to cutting high-profile newsmen loose. After arriving to a ratings slide at several major shows, Turness was uncompromising in cutting out figures that some saw as staid and unexciting. David Gregory, the longtime moderate on the Meet the Press political show, was sacked last August after Turness after extensively wrangling over the show's format and guests, according to the Daily Beast. Gregory was reportedly picking up his kids from summer camp when CNN broke the news that he was being replaced - which NBC then had to rush to confirm. That sacking came not long after the network got rid of Jamie Horowitz - a former ESPN executive whom Turness employed for a total of just ten weeks. Horowitz reportedly made so many enemies in his task of reforming the Today show that it became impossible to keep him on. In a memo to NBC staffers, Turness said: 'he and I have come to the conclusion that this is not the right fit.' Whether Brian Williams will ultimately be faced with the same conclusion remains to be seen. His plight worsened after other grand, personal stories - from Hurricane Katrina, Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah, and even a childhood tale of being mugged - were also called into question. In her note, Turness wrote: 'We have decided today to suspend Brian Williams as Managing Editor and Anchor of NBC Nightly News for six months. 'The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately.' 'While on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003. 'It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues. This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian’s position. 'In addition, we have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field. Steve Burke, the CEO of NBC Universal, also spoke out in the message. He said: 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. 'His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate.' However, he implied that Williams would eventually come back from the suspension, saying he is 'committed' to regaining his tattered credibility. Burke said: 'He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone’s trust. Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Deborah Turness told NBC staff about suspension Tuesday evening .

"Among the thousands of men slain on the battlefield at Waterloo, he died, unrecognised and uncelebrated. But almost 200 years later, archaeologists have unearthed the remains of the soldier – with the musket ball that felled him still between his ribs. Historians believe he is from one of the Duke of Wellington’s British regiments, and described the discovery of the skeleton as one of the best ever war finds. Amazing discovery: The almost complete skeleton, found buried on land the British held, is believed to be a 20-year-old soldier from one of the Duke of Wellington's regiments who died during the Battle of Waterloo . Cause of death: A musket ball in the soldier's rib cage is believed to have felled him on June 18, 1815 . They are now hoping that the thick Belgian mud has preserved his personal items well enough to help them identify him. Archaeologists have uncovered a . regimental spoon, a piece of decorated leather from his uniform, coins, . and a piece of wood, possibly a rifle butt, inscribed with the initials . ‘C B’. Analysis of the items could lead them to the army, regiment and even the name of the fallen hero. Belgian archaeologist Dominique . Bosquet said: ‘The remains were found behind the British lines close to . the infirmary which makes the soldier most likely British. ‘The position where the skeleton was . found would make it very difficult for it to be from a French soldier. A . musket ball was found inside the rib cage. This was probably the cause . of death – a gunshot wound to the chest. ‘We believe that after he was injured he was carried back from the line and that is where he died.’ Clue: The initials C.B. carved into a nearby piece of wood - possibly a rifle butt - may help reveal his identity . Possessions: Some coins found by the skeleton's remains might also help archeologists identify him . Preserved: A large spoon was also found lying next to the engraved piece of wood . The skeleton came to light as Belgium . prepares for the 200th anniversary of the battle that ended the reign of . Napoleon Bonaparte and France’s domination of Europe. The remains were unearthed during the . excavation of plots of land for a car park close to the Lion Mound . monument, near the hamlet of Mont Saint-Jean. Sadly the skull was crushed by the . mechanical digger before the remains became visible. But the skeleton is . still one of the best preserved from the battle, although it is missing . a foot and some small hand bones. Napoleon Bonaparte and his ruthlessly efficient Grande Armee once dominated continental Europe. Britain - fearing the diminutive general’s spread of revolutionary republicanism - engaged in  seven campaigns against him, losing five. Napoleon’s greatest victory came in 1805 at Austerlitz in 1805, where French troops killed 19,000 of their numerically superior adversaries while sustaining only 7,000 casualties themselves. What made the win even more impressive was that his soldiers completed the rout in just six hours. Yet, by 1814, he had abdicated as emporer after failing to encourage the French to continue fighting following his disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia. But despite his exile in the isle of Elba, the great general managed to return to France, raise an army and fight one last epic battle. On June 18, 1815, Napoleon led his 72,000-strong army into battle with 120,000 Allied soldiers on the gently rolling plateau of Waterloo in Belgium. The Allied army was a coalition of British, Dutch, German, Belgian and Prussian soldiers. The two sides remained in a bloody embrace for several hours that resulted in the slaughter of 9,500 men. But at the end of the afternoon the French emperor's Great Army was defeated by the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal Blucher, commander of the Prussian army. Early analysis suggests the remains . are of a 20-year-old man, who was 5ft 1in tall with teeth worn by biting . open gunpowder tubes. Most of the British casualties were . buried at a cemetery in Evere, near Brussels, but many remained where . they fell. Yves Van Der Cruysen, director of the Battle of Waterloo . Association, said: ‘This is a major discovery. 'It is the first time for . over a hundred years that a complete corpse of a combatant from the time . has been discovered in such a good state. ‘The body clearly has not been robbed . as we found money on him, including a half franc coin from 1811. 'There . were also other coins which we are having analysed. ‘He could have been buried by a comrade or simply missed when the bodies were gathered up after the battle for burial. ‘We hope to find evidence of his . regiment from the spoon and the leather epaulets that were found with . the corpse. And we know the names of the combatants thanks to military . records of the time. ‘When the soldier’s regiment can be determined we should be able to find his identity.’ The Battle of Waterloo, on June 18, . 1815, was fought in a sprawling field some ten miles south of Brussels. The battle was between France and the Allied armies of British, German, . Dutch and Belgian soldiers under the command of the Duke of Wellington . and General Blucher of Prussia.

"The family of a teacher killed in the Sandy Hook school massacre has applied to trademark her name in an attempt to stop others from misusing it on social media. Victoria Soto was a 27-year-old first grade teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School who authorities have said hid students and tried to shield others from Adam Lanza, the gunman who killed 20 children and six women on December 14, 2012. Eleven students in her classroom survived. Jillian Soto says people have set up fake social media accounts using her sister's name, many of which promote conspiracy theories about the massacre, and some of which are used to harass her and other family members. Trademark: Jillian Soto, center, with sister Carlee Soto, left and brother Carlos Soto, the siblings of Victoria Soto has applied to trademark to Victoria Soto's name in an attempt to stop others from misusing it . Victim: Victoria Soto was a 27-year-old first grade teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School who authorities  said hid students and tried to shield others from the gunman who killed 20 children and six women . Conspiracy theorists: Carlee Soto (left) wants people to stop using her deceased sister Victoria Soto's (right) name for their own conspiracy theories . 'Vicki did a heroic thing, there are 11 kids that are alive today because of the actions of my sister,' she said. 'And we don't need anything negative to be tied to her name any longer.' She said the misuse of her sister's name also makes it harder for people to find links to the Vicki Soto Memorial Fund, which raises money for scholarships for aspiring educators. Ryan Graney, who helps the Soto family run its social media sites, said every time an abusive or unauthorized Twitter account appears, she has to fill out a form and send it to the company. Twitter then does an investigation and determines whether the account violates the company's policies and should be removed. She said the family applied for the trademark protection on Monday in the hopes of expediting that process. 'Now we can say, ""Look they can't use this name, it has to come down right now,""' she said. The gunman: Adam Lanza shot 20 children and six women in the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012 . Victims: Pictured are the children who died at the hands of gunman Adam Lanza during the Sandy Hook massacre in December of 2012 . Nu Wexler, a Twitter spokesman, declined to comment in an email, but pointed to the company's impersonation policy, which says accounts can be permanently suspended if they are deemed to be 'portraying another person in a confusing or deceptive manner.' The Connecticut Attorney General's office said it has not received any formal complaints from Sandy Hook families about abuse on Twitter. 'We did follow up on complaints that families had made regarding Facebook pages, and did find Facebook to be responsive to our concerns,' said spokeswoman Jaclyn Falkowski. 'We would encourage families to contact our office about problems they're experiencing on Twitter so that we might be able to offer our assistance.'

This is the moment she found out her sister Victoria was dead. This iconic image is one that has come to represent the horror of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20 children and six adults were killed. Now years later, Carlee is trying to protect her sister's name and image and ensure it doesn't get into the hands of conspiracy theorists  who are using her sister's name for their own ill-informed gain.","Victoria Soto was a 27-year-old first grade teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School who died while protecting 11 students .

"Ed Miliband’s relationship with business hit a new low last night after he snubbed a major gathering of company executives. The Labour leader, who is struggling to persuade business leaders that he is on their side, stunned organisers of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) annual conference by telling them he was too busy to attend. BCC director general John Longworth described Mr Miliband’s absence as ‘disappointing’, while critics said it showed he had ‘nothing to say’ to business. Scroll down for video . John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce described Ed Miliband's absence due to 'other committments' as 'disappointing' after he was represented by Ed Balls and Chuka Umunna . The conference, one of the biggest annual gatherings of business representatives, was addressed by both David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Labour sent Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and business spokesman Chuka Umunna. However Mr Miliband spent the day locked in ‘internal meetings’ in Westminster – just 200 yards from the conference venue. Mr Longworth said: ‘It is disappointing that Ed Miliband is not at our conference. It was an opportunity to speak in a friendly business environment and to present his views.’ He explained that the conference organisers had been told the Labour leader had ‘other commitments’. Labour initially declined to comment on Mr Miliband’s whereabouts. But a source later confirmed Mr Miliband had been holding meetings with advisers in Westminster. The source insisted Mr Miliband had not met with Unite union boss Len McCluskey, who was seen at the Commons yesterday. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said it was ‘ridiculous’ to accuse him of snubbing business leaders. ‘Ed Miliband has given ten speeches to major business conferences since becoming Labour Leader including twice at the BCC,’ the spokesman said. Ed Balls accused critics of ‘scraping the barrel of trivia’. But business minister Matt Hancock said: ‘Ed Miliband had literally nothing to say to the nation’s employers. He knows British businesses don’t back him and he was too weak even to talk to them. He has no economic plan to secure a better future for Britain and would only take us back.’ And a Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘It’s astounding Ed Miliband has snubbed British business, especially in the week Labour has been accused of being anti-commerce. ‘It just goes to show Labour do not understand the importance of business in creating jobs and maintaining our hard-fought economic recovery. We know Ed Miliband can’t remember the deficit and it looks like he’s forgotten business too.’ Ed Miliband, pictured, has been accused of 'having nothing to say to Britain's employers' Mr Miliband has come under fire from a string of senior business figures in recent weeks, including the head of Boots Stefano Pessina and the former Marks and Spencer boss Stuart Rose. David Cameron said that while Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had backed the cross-party consensus that a healthy business environment was essential for growth, that consensus would be ‘over’ if Mr Miliband seizes power in May. Mr Umunna dismissed the charge, insisting that Labour remains pro-business. And yesterday Labour attempted to get on the front foot by unveiling a new business donor. Dale Vince, founder of green energy firm Ecotricity, announced that he was giving the party £250,000. However last night it emerged that Mr Vince is also a leading critic of Mr Miliband’s flagship plan to freeze energy prices until 2017. He has previously said: ‘I’m not sure how it would work. And if the Government begins freezing energy prices, where does it stop? Will they freeze petrol or food prices too?’","Ed Miliband has been accused of 'having nothing to say to business'

"As showboating goes, this is about as dangerous as it gets. The foolish fly-bys are being performed by an Argentine pilot at one of the South American nation's air bases in Antarctica.

"An ancient prophecy romanticised by ISIS militants warns of a battle between an Islamic army and an 'infidel horde' in Syria which will herald the destruction of the world. The 1,300-year-old hadith, which is a report of the deeds, teachings and sayings of the Prophet Mohammed, refers to the 'horde' flying 80 banners as they take on a Muslim army in the Syrian town of Dabiq. It warns of a 'malahim' - the equivalent to Armageddon in Christian teachings – in which the Muslims ultimately prevail. Scroll down for videos . The ancient  prophecy is said to be a fundamental part of Islamic State's ideology and is being used to fuel recruitment of jihadists. The 1,300-year-old tale predicted a war between an Islamic army and an 'infidel horde' Islamic State fighters are said to have drawn on the ancient prophecy even more so since conquering Dabiq in August. Airstrikes continued in the Syrian town of Ain al-Arab, known as Kobane by the Kurds, yesterday . The prophecy is said to be a fundamental part of Islamic State's ideology and is being used to fuel recruitment of jihadists who believe they are on the 'cusp of history'. ISIS supporters on social media have started comparing recent developments in Syria to the prophecy amid warnings the 'malahim' is coming. Islamic State fighters are said to have drawn on the prophecy even more so since conquering Dabiq in August and the town's name has become a byword for the struggle against the West. The terrorist group has even named its official magazine 'Dabiq', in which it pushes its extremist views and reports victories. Supporters appear to be convinced of the prophecy's validity, with one writing on Twitter: 'Dabiq will happen for certain. 'The U.S. and its allies will descend on Syria once they see that the air campaign has failed. That is a promise by God and his Messenger.' Another, from Tunisia, wrote. 'The lions of Islam have raised the banner of the Caliphate in Dabiq. Now they await the arrival of the Crusader army.' Shadi Hamid, a fellow at the Brookings Institute, said the hadith is heavily relied upon by ISIS because it 'raises morale'. He said: 'It is fair to assume that the vast majority of (ISIS) fighters believe in this type of talk.' ISIS has even named its official magazine, which reinforces its extremist views, 'Dabiq' (two editions above) Hit: A picture taken from inside Turkey shows smoke rising over the Syrian city of Kobane following yesterday's airstrikes against ISIS militants. The terrorists have been besieging the city for the last three weeks . Strike: Journalists on the Turkish side of the border heard the sound of planes before two large plumes of smoke billowed just west of Kobane in yesterday's attack . Blast: The U.S. led anti-ISIS coalition carried out yesterday's airstrikes in Kobane. The attacks targeted ISIS militants who have advanced into the city, which is located right on northern Syria's border with Turkey . It comes as U.S.-led airstrikes continue in Kobani, where ISIS militants have been fighting with Kurdish forces to take hold. In the wake of the ongoing conflict, President Barack Obama met with military commanders to discuss fears that airstrikes alone may not be enough to stop the fanatics. 'As I've indicated from the start, this is not something that is going to be solved overnight,' he said. Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby added: 'Airstrikes alone are not going to do this, not going to fix this, not going to save the town of Kobani. 'We know that. And we've been saying that over and over again.' Fire: A building believed to have been occupied by ISIS forces in the Kobane suburbs is seen burning following airstrikes by a U.S. led coalition against the terror group . Threat: A black flag belonging to ISIS has been raised above a four-storey building in the Kobane suburbs . Street fighting raged between Kurdish forces and ISIS fanatics , after the terror group advanced into Kobane . A U.S. Navy F-18E Super Hornet helped unleash a wave of airstrikes against Islamic State jihadists in Syria . The ancient hadith has been passed down in different versions over the last 1,000 years but in all cases it has centred on a battle between a Muslim army and the forces of non-believers. Prophecy has played a role in the movement's ideology since its early days as Al-Qaeda in Iraq under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Before Zarqawi was killed in Iraq in a U.S. airstrike in 2006 and long before his movement evolved into ISIS he was already referring to the epic battle in Dabiq. 'The spark has been ignited in Iraq, and its flames will grow until they burn the Crusader armies in Dabiq,' he once said.","Prophecy predicted war between Islamic army and 'infidel horde' in Syria .

"Copycats: A commercial satellite flying over the Persian Gulf photographed what appears to be a replica of a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier under construction at a ship yard near Bandar Abbas, Iran . Iran is in the process of building a mock-up of an American Nimitz-class aircraft carrier with the possible goal of blowing it up as a publicity stunt. Construction on the crude model appears to be in full swing at a shipyard near Bandar Abbas, as shown in newly released commercial satellite images. 'They got this barge and threw some wood on top of it to make it look like the USS Nimitz. That's all we know for sure,' a U.S. defense official told AFP. Officials in the Obama administration believe that the faux carrier might be used for propaganda value, but they are not sure at this time what Teheran is hoping to accomplish with this project. The wooden, non-operational aircraft carrier made to look like a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered American vessel was first spotted on the Persian Gulf last summer, the New York Times reported. Besides having the shape of the 1,100-foot-long carriers, such as USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Carl Vinson, the shipbuilders also replicated the distinctive white markings on the bow. A satellite flying over Gachin shipyard also photographed a fake plane parked on the deck of the equally fake carrier. But officials are not overly concerned with the boxy, too-short replica, saying that unlike the real thing, Iran's glorified barge is not operational or propelled by nuclear power. The real thing: The U.S. Navy has ten Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, which are 1,100 feet in length and feature a nuclear propulsion system . It still remains a mystery what Teheran is planning to do with the copy once it is complete. One theory is that the Nimitz-inspired vessel could be towed to sea and detonated, with the explosion shown on state TV for anti-American propaganda purposes. According to the Times, Iran has used barges for televised missile target practice in the past. Devil's in the details: Iranian shipbuilders supplied their glorified barge with white markings characteristic of Nimitz carriers, but officials are certain that the fake vessel is not operational and has no nuclear power . FARS News reported that in June, Iran launched its overhauled destroyer named Bayando, but American analysts are convinced that the Middle Eastern nation is not capable of building an aircraft carrier. ‘It is not surprising that Iranian naval forces might use a variety of tactics -- including military deception tactics -- to communicate and possibly demonstrate their resolve in the region,’ said another U.S. official. The revelations concerning the barge come four months after Teheran came to a temporary agreement with the world powers over its nuclear program, parts of which are expected to be rolled back in exchange for an end to some economic sanctions, according to CNN. Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have been at an all-time low recently, and over the past year, there have been fewer Iranian speedboats pestering American warships in the Strait of Hormuz. On Thursday, President Barack Obama sent a message to the Iranian people to mark the Persian New York, saying that he is 'committed to diplomacy.'","Mock-up model complete with white markings like on the original is being built at a shipyard near Bandar Abbas on Persian Gulf .

"The Royal Navy's newest submarine - a miniature sub which can launch underwater that James Bond would be proud of, has been spotted moored off of Gibraltar. The submarine is intended to launch underwater in order to carry commandos to their destinations covertly so they can perform attacks or infiltration near the water. Attached to a large nuclear sub, the mini pod can carry up to around eight elite commandos in heavy assault gear and is designed to be as stealthy as possible. The miniature submarine atop the HMS Astute, as manufacturers look on at its installation . The pod can be seen attached to the topside of the nuclear submarine, the HMS Astute, currently off the coast of Gibraltar. In a covert attack, the secret submarine pod will detach from the HMS Astute and head to its destination, absorbing sonar on the way to evade detection. The pod will be in use by Special Boat Service commandos in their covert operations, and the miniature submarine will likely make their activities hard to predict or anticipate. HMS Astute, one of British Royal Navy's new nuclear powered submarines, lays at dock in Gibraltar on its maiden call . The mini-sub opening its deployment hatch, where the commandos will leave from during their covert operations . Before it was mounted to the top of the HMS Astute, the miniature submarine had to be airlifted by helicopter to seas near its destination, before being picked up later. Now the submarine will move closer to the destination, and plans for deployment and support for the commandos will be more readily available. The miniature submarine, codenamed 'Project Chalfont', has been tested since it was installed in 2012, but this is the first time it will reach active service. The miniature covert submarine is designed to be as stealthy as possible, and even comes with the ability to absorb sonar to avoid detection . The HMS Astute is the largest attack submarine the Royal Navy has at its disposal, and is the lead ship of its class. Thanks to air recycling it could theoretically circumnavigate the planet without having to resurface, and its nuclear power system means it will never have to refuel again during its 25-year-service. However, its limit is that it is only able to carry three months worth of food for the 98 crew needed to man it. The miniature submarine's main duties are for counter intelligence, as it allows for incredibly covert ops from discreet locations, and will now be able to deploy while hidden underwater, rather than having to travel by helicopter, which runs the risk of revealing its position.","Attached to the HMS Astute, the mini pod can carry up eight commandos .

"Grizzly bears have emerged from hibernation far earlier than expected in Yellowstone. The first confirmed report of grizzly bear activity in Yellowstone occurred on February 9, rangers confirmed today. They usually emerge in first few weeks of March, prompting ranger to issue emergency warnings to visitors. The first confirmed report of grizzly bear activity in Yellowstone occurred on February 9, rangers confirmed today. They blame the relatively mild winter weather for the early emergence of bears in the Greater Yellowstone area. A grizzly bear was observed late in the afternoon, scavenging on a bison carcass in the central portion of the park. 'With bears emerging from hibernation hikers, skiers, and snowshoers are advised to stay in groups of three of more, make noise on the trail and carry bear spray,' the park said. The same advice goes for those taking guided snowmobile trips in Yellowstone. Bears begin looking for food soon after they emerge from their dens. They are attracted to elk and bison that have died during the winter. Carcasses are an important enough food source that bears will sometimes react aggressively when surprised while feeding on them. Yellowstone regulations require visitors to stay 100 yards from black and grizzly bears at all times. The best defense is to stay a safe distance from bears and use binoculars, a spotting scope or telephoto lens to get a closer look, the park said. It advises all visitors traveling in the park away from developed areas should stay in groups of three or more, make noise on the trail, keep an eye out for bears and carry bear spray. Yellowstone regulations require visitors to stay 100 yards from black and grizzly bears at all times. 'Bear spray has proven to be a good last line of defense, if kept handy and used according to directions when a bear is approaching within 30 to 60 feet,' it advises. Even the park’s law enforcement rangers who carry firearms on duty rely on bear spray, rather than their weapons, as the most effective means to deal with a bear encounter. Visitors are also reminded to keep food, garbage, barbecue grills and other attractants stored in hard-sided vehicles or bear-proof food storage boxes. This helps keep bears from becoming conditioned to human foods, and helps keep park visitors and their property safe. Bear sightings should be reported to the nearest visitor center or ranger station as soon as possible.","First confirmed report of grizzly activity in Yellowstone on February 9 .

"A US fighter jet pilot was in hot water today over a supersonic flight over a Welsh seaside town at 800mph. The flight caused a huge sonic boom blast, which smashed windows in Aberystwyth, terrified locals, and caused the ground to shake. US Air Force chiefs have apologised for the accidental boom, which is a breach of aviation rules, caused by one of its F-15E Strike Eagle jet fighters going too fast during a training exercise. Boom: A US Air Force pilot was in hot water today over a supersonic flight in an F-15E jet fighter, similar to the one pictured, over a Aberystwyth at 800mph . The jet flew more than 200 miles across Britain from Suffolk to the Welsh coast - but it broke the 761mph speed of sound over Aberystwyth. The sonic boom was so severe it caused two classroom windows to smash in Penglais High School, and caused ceiling tiles to come crashing down in a Morrisons supermarket. Housewife Janet Williams, 58, was in the meat aisle when she heard what she thought was an explosion. 'I always do my weekly shop on a Monday because it is much quieter and there aren't so many people about,' she said. 'I was picking up a joint of beef when I heard a huge explosion and the ceiling tiles came down - I thought the world was coming to an end. Mission: The aircraft had flown from RAF Lakenheath to the Welsh coast for an air-to-air training mission . 'The noise just came out of nowhere and made me drop my beef! 'We thought a plane had crashed into the roof it was so loud - it was just shocking.' People in the coastal town took to Twitter to report feeling a huge tremor which smashed windows and caused roof tiles to fall on Monday afternoon. University student Daniel McConaghy tweeted: 'Just experienced my first sonic boom whilst sitting innocently in the library trying to work - only in Aberystwyth!' Night-shift worker Greg Babalicki said: 'I was just falling asleep and the sonic boom happened. Keep it down please!'

Night-shift worker Greg Babalicki said: 'I was just falling asleep and the sonic boom happened. Keep it down please!' Some thought a bomb had been dropped on the town but others believed an earthquake had struck. The F-15E Strike Eagle is an all-weather multirole fighter designed in the 1980s for long-range and high speed missions. The jet's top speed is around 1,650mph - more than twice the speed of sound, and double its speed over Aberystwyth. Built by Boeing, formerly McDonnell Douglas, it was first flown on December 11, 1986, and introduced in April 1988. The model, which carries a crew of two people, has been deployed for operations in Iraq, including Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Afghanistan and Libya, carrying out air strikes and patrols as well as supporting troops on the ground. As well as the US Air Force the jet is also used by the Royal Saudi Air Force, the Israeli Air Force and the Republic of Korea Air Force. The plane is controlled via a central computer, connected to an array of sensors - with the pilot giving instructions to the computer, which can also make adjustments on its own to improve flight performance. Hannah Whaites almost set her carpet on fire when the massive noise occured while she was straightening her hair. She tweeted: 'Sonic boom just made me drop my straighteners and burn the carpet.' A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object traveling through the air faster than the speed of sound. The US Air Force's 48th fighter wing today apologised for the disturbance saying several of its F-15E jets from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk had been training near the coast. It said one plane inadvertently broke the sound barrier - causing the boom. A spokesman said: 'We can confirm that an aircraft from RAF Lakenheath is likely to have been responsible for the sonic boom reported over Aberystwyth. 'At that time, several F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft were conducting a challenging air-to-air training mission. 'Typically, this would be carried out over water but the airspace to be used was lost to us and the jets were re-routed to the Wales military training airspace. 'During the course of the training exercise, near the coast and in the vicinity of Aberystwyth, one of the aircraft, already travelling at high speed, inadvertently and briefly went supersonic at around 18,000ft and in the process was likely to have caused the noise that was reported online. 'We offer our sincerest apologies for any disturbance or concern that this may have caused. 'We continue to emphasise airspeed restrictions in our pre-flight briefings to minimise the possibility of inadvertently breaching the sound barrier.' The sonic boom has prompted renewed calls for the Ministry of Defence to give better warning about low flying jets in the area. Last year, two trainee RAF fighter pilots in Hawk jets narrowly avoided a disastrous 600mph mid-air collision just off the coast of Aberystwyth. Councillor Alun Williams said: 'The MoD needs to start liaising with the community about these exercises and giving proper warning each time. 'They need to explain the purpose of the exercises and why they can't be held out at sea.'","The F-15E Strike Eagle broke the speed of sound and caused a sonic boom .

"A mother-of-two whose cancer left her bed-bound for two years found a way to stay positive - by writing erotic fiction. Jayne Allen, 56, was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2008 and was operated on immediately after doctors found a tumour smothering her whole kidney. After having the affected kidney removed, Jayne was left with a number of other health problems which confined her to her bed for several years. Jayne Allen was left house bound for years after being diagnosed with kidney cancer, in a bid to keep herself busy she turned her hand to erotic fiction . The care worker from Coventry was forced to quit her job as she was in too much pain to leave the house. In a bid to distract herself from her poor health, she picked up E L James's hit book Fifty Shade of Grey. It was while reading the bestseller that Jayne decided that she fancied having a go at writing her own naughty novel, adding that she thought she could show E L James a thing or two. 'I was doing it for myself, to begin with, because of a desire to do something shocking. I started the novel and had written 50,000 words within the first month. It's a bloody thriller full of sex and revenge, so I had a lot of fun writing it.' Her book It's A Secret has proved popular online and in bookshops selling hundreds of copies - as well as helping Jayne put her cancer battle behind her. As well as her writing providing her solace, Jayne found her husband to be a great support throughout her cancer battle. Jayne was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 and although she didn't have to have chemotherapy her operation meant she was bed-bound for most of the time . Jayne's husband Bill suggested she started writing after reading his wife's diaries . Jayne married second husband Bill, 57, in 2008 and they had just begun decorating their new home together when Jayne began to experience pain in her side. 'After my operation, I found I couldn't move or walk or do anything for a couple of years, so through sheer boredom I decided to write something. 'I thought if EL James could do it, then I could do it. I hadn't read it cover to cover but I couldn't believe how popular it was. And I'd heard it wasn't especially well written so I thought I could do better.' Jayne quickly found that writing her novel was just what she needed to keep her positive and made progress very quickly. 'They removed the kidney the following month and thankfully I didn't have to have chemotherapy because they'd found the tumour just in time. It was a slow-growing cancer, but I had MRI scans every few months to ensure the cancer hadn't spread.' Despite remaining cancer-free, Jayne has been left with numerous health problems including disequilibrium syndrome, which she nicknames 'old lady syndrome' as it leaves her with loss of balance and severe fatigue. With Jayne housebound since leaving her job as a care worker in 2009, it was Bill - a car maintenance officer for the police - who suggested she take up writing. Jayne bought Fifty Shades of Grey and decided that she could do better than author E L James . Jayne occasionally includes her own sexual experiences with husband Bill (pictured) in her novels . The couple were heartbroken when a routine MRI scan revealed the tumour covering her whole kidney. Jayne, who has two grown-up children from her previous marriage, says the cancer came as a massive shock to them both. 'Bill is my soulmate. We were like any loved-up newlyweds that year despite being in our late 40s - we both felt we had a new lease of life having married each other. 'After our house move I started getting a lot of pain and discomfort in my side so my GP referred me for an MRI scan. 'I don't think at that point they were actually looking for cancer, just attempting to find out what was wrong. But it turned out my tumour was quite advanced and had covered my whole right kidney.' She said: 'Some days I couldn't leave the house as my mobility was so badly affected. I needed something to take my mind off the pain and boredom. I'd let Bill read some of my old diaries a few months earlier and he thought they were great, so the novel was all his idea. Before starting It's A Secret Jayne experimented with several other genres before deciding on a more sensual story line. 'I dabbled with other genres and wrote some poetry, and in 2011 I started working on my erotic novel. Jayne says she has received hugely positive feedback about her book and even her children have read it . 'The eroticism in It's A Secret is mostly wishful thinking, like me wanting to join the Mile High Club. I put that in as a little teaser for myself. I had a lot of fun with it. 'I was shocked at myself that I would put such raunchy details into the book. I was trying to write things that would help my readers feel all the different pleasures of having sex, the same that I felt writing it.' As well as fantasies, Jayne included a number of experiences from her own sex life in the novel. 'Certain scenes do reflect mine and Bill's relationship. But I wouldn't put everything in the book, as some things are private. I do draw the line. 'Thankfully Bill doesn't mind me including bits about him, although of course he's the only one who knows which bits they are.' Jayne added that her and Bill have always enjoyed  an erotic relationship and the novel has helped to unite them further. Jayne has now sold hundreds of copies of her book It's a Secret and is currently writing a sequel . 'I once painted Bill in the nude so I suppose we've always been a very sensual couple. I wanted to put the painting up on the wall but he wouldn't let me. 'The novel has brought us closer together and although he can't believe it was me who wrote it, he is so proud. Apparently I am sexier than I have ever been!' Jayne says that her children have been equally supportive of her writing: 'I have grown-up children and my daughter has read It's A Secret and thinks it's great. She loves what I'm doing.' The mother-of-two says that she has seen the landscape of sexual liberation completely change and that we are lucky to be able to enjoy books like hers. 'Women have always been suppressed when it comes to sex. You are a slut if you sleep around, or not a very nice woman if you want sex. 'But women are more accepted now. If you want sex, go out and get it. If you just want a one-night stand it is acceptable and that's how it should be. In my mum's day you could have been stoned for reading a book like this. Equality isn't quite there, but we are working on it.' Jayne published It's A Secret in 2012 through self-publishing firm AuthorHouse UK and it's available to buy in major bookshops and online. The book's blurb states: 'If you want a fast moving compelling, bloody sexual erotic experience, then come inside this fantasy. It is full of want and need, passion and hatred. Mostly, revenge is sweet but what comes with the before and after? Feelings of so many wants, needs, mistrust and rage. Read me, I'm yours.' Jayne says she has been thrilled with the positive response her novel has received so far and plans to continue writing. 'The book is gradually becoming well-known. I do book signings when I can. It's become more and more popular and I've had people contact me on Facebook demanding that I write a sequel, so that's what I'm in the middle of now. The sequel's called It's a Secret Too. 'Writing keeps me sane. I have just been signed off work for another two years, but knowing I have this to work on helps me to stay positive. I've managed to create something fun and exciting out of a very hard situation - excuse the pun!'","Jayne Allen, 56, was housebound for years after kidney cancer op in 2008 .

"For decades Wally has eluded millions of children in the classic book series - and he’s likely frustrated a number of adults too. To make finding the bespectacled Wally - or Waldo, as he is known in the US - easier, a Michigan-based computer scientist has devised a strategy using machine learning and algorithms. By plotting the character's location across the series, Randal Olson created the path needed to travel around a typical page and find Wally in the quickest way possible each time. Mr Olson used an algorithm to approximate the ‘optimal search path’ (pictured). He then divided the path into four sections, the first part is shown in blue, the second is orange, the third is green and the final section is shown in red. This path represents one of the shortest possible paths to follow on the page to find Wally . The method built on a previous strategy by Ben Blatt from Slate magazine in November 2013. During this research, Mr Blatt plotted Wally’s 68 locations across seven books. Mr Olson took these plots to create a so-called kernel density estimation. This established the probability of Wally being found in certain parts of a page. From this, Mr Olson discovered that Wally is rarely located in the top left-hand corner, or along the edges, to account for the box that typically described the setting and for printing inconsistencies. Wally was also never found on the bottom of the right-hand page. Next, Mr Olson used what is known as the ‘travelling salesman problem’ to check every possible Wally location in the shortest time possible, with the least repetition. By following this method, Mr Olson was able to ‘zoom through most illustrations’ (example pictured) in less than 10 seconds. He also discovered that on at least four occasions, book one in particular had instances or ‘outliers’ in which the strategy didn't work . To make finding Wally - known as Waldo in the US - easier, a  computer scientist plotted all of the character's 68 locations across seven of the classic books (pictured). The method built on a previous strategy created by Ben Blatt from Slate magazine in November 2013 . ‘In computer terms, that means we’re making a list of all 68 points that Wally could be at, then sorting them based on the order that we’re going to visit them,’ explained Mr Olson on his blog. ‘Those 68 points can be arranged in ~2.48 x 1096 possible ways. To provide some context, that’s more possible arrangements than the number of atoms in the universe.’ Due to the complexity of the task, Mr Olson used machine learning to approximate the ‘optimal search path’ based on an algorithm.

Randal Olson used an algorithm to plot the shortest path required to find Wally. But, Mr Olson acknowledged that humans are unable to remember a path as easily as a computer and revealed tips to make the process easier. Wally is rarely located in the top left-hand corner, or along the edges, for example. He is also rarely found on the bottom of the right-hand page. Start on the bottom half of the left-hand page.If Wally isn’t on the bottom half of the left page, 'then he’s probably not on the left page at all'. The upper quarter of the right page is the next best place to look and Mr Olson said 'Wally seems to prefer to hide on the upper quarter of the right page.' Next check the bottom right half of the right page. Mr Olson added Wally has an aversion to the bottom left half of the right page and searchers shouldn't bother looking there until they're exhausted the other hot spots. He ran this algorithm for five minutes and created a solution that divided the path into four sections:  the first part is shown in blue, the second is orange, the third is green and the final section is shown in red. ‘This path represents one of the shortest possible paths to follow on the page to find Wally,’ continued Mr Olson. ‘So if we followed this path exactly, we’d most likely find Wally much faster than someone following a more basic technique.’ But, Mr Olson acknowledged that humans are unable to remember a path as easily as a computer and revealed tips to make the process easier.

"Marijuana makes money. But legalizing it doesn't eliminate the black market or solve a state's budget problems. Those are the lessons from Colorado's first full year of tax collections on recreational pot. The year-end report, released Tuesday, tallied about $44 million in new sales taxes and excise taxes from recreational pot. Add fees and pre-existing taxes from medical pot, which has been legal since 2000, and Colorado's total 2014 pot haul was about $76 million. Taxes: Colorado tallied about $44 million in new sales taxes and excise taxes from recreational pot in 2014 . Colorado was the first government anywhere in the world to regulate marijuana production and sales, so other governments are watching closely. Estimates varied widely for how much money Colorado would make, and the final hard numbers have important lessons for other states considering legal weed markets. Colorado started selling recreational weed on Jan. 1, 2014. But its first month of sales resulted in only $1.6 million for the state. By December, that figure was $5.4 million. For reference, in February, it was about $ 1.8 million; March, about $ 2.5 million; April, about $3 million; May, approximately $3.2 million; June, about $3.4 million; July, approximately $4.4 million; August, about $4.8 million; September, about $4.4 million; October, approximately $5 million; and November, approximately $4.3 million. KBTX reported that the $44 million figure is lower than what was first predicted, writing that 'new taxes were estimated to bring in about $70 million.' The reason for the increase? Regulatory delays. Red tape meant stores opened slowly, with many municipalities waiting months before allowing pot shops to open. In Washington state, delays were even more pronounced. Washington voters legalized pot at the same time Colorado did, in 2012. But retail sales in Washington didn't start until June, with stores slowly opening and sales increasing each month. Things will speed up as more states legalize pot and can look to Colorado and Washington for regulatory guidance. But legal weed isn't an overnight flood of tax money. 'Everyone who thinks Colorado's rollin' in the dough because of marijuana? That's not true,' said state Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat and one of the Legislature's main budget-writers. Washington and Colorado set vastly different tax rates, both based on a percentage of the pot's value. The states then had to immediately set a value for a product with no legal sales history. What's the right price? Colorado's pot regulators have struggled to establish a wholesale pot price to collect excise taxes. 'Taxing a percentage of price may simply not work,' said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana's tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue. He pointed out that the two latest legal weed states — Alaska and Oregon, both still working on retail regulations — will tax marijuana by weight, similar to how tobacco is taxed. Every state in the union, liberal to conservative, has a market for marijuana. And making pot legal doesn't guarantee those consumers will leave the black market and happily sign up to start paying taxes. In Washington state, medical marijuana isn't taxed. It is in Colorado, but all adults are allowed to grow up to six plants on their own. That means the states' new marijuana markets had legal competition from Day One. And that doesn't account for the black market, which of course is completely free of taxes and regulations. Lawmakers in both Colorado and Washington are looking for ways to drive pot smokers out of the lower-taxed medical pot market and into the recreational one. But obstacles are stiff. 'If there is untaxed medical pot, the taxes are voluntary. When you make it voluntary, people won't necessarily pay,' Oglesby said. The marijuana market is far from settled. Colorado benefited from first-in-the-nation curiosity and marijuana tourism. As more states legalize, Colorado and Washington will face competition. 'Colorado is probably kind of a best-case scenario' for pot tax collections, said Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard University economist who studies the drug market. 'If a number of other states legalize — and two of them already have — then bit by bit, Colorado revenue is likely to decline.' There's an even bigger uncertainty looming for states considering legal weed — a new president in 2016. 'The huge unknown is still federal policy,' Miron said. 'A new president can radically change state policies toward legalization.' Senators Pat Steadman, left, D-Denver, and Lucia Guzman, D-Denver, are seen in this 2013 file photo. Steadman is one of Colorado's legislative budget-writers and has been tasked with following Colorado's pot tax collections .","Colorado's year-end tax report was released Tuesday .

The 31-year-old councillor, who is married to Labour MP Simon Danczuk, has promised to go on a date with 'one lucky person' in aid of two charities, Key 103 Cash for Kids in Manchester and the Rochdale RSPCA . Mrs Danczuk, who shot to fame after posting a series of racy selfies online, also told MailOnline that Manchester restaurant Tertutti has now agreed to host the date for her and her winner. Her husband, who now faces spending Valentine's night on his own, has also launched his own mini campaign, asking his Twitter followers to find him a date for the same night. She told MailOnline: 'I had had so many offers from people asking to take me out on a date for Valentine's, so I just thought I might as well make something out of it and raise money for charity. I do a lot for charity anyway. 'There were two people who bid £10,000 so I had to tell them that one had to go higher. It then went to £10,300. 'The cut off isn't until Friday at 12pm, so it could go higher, but I'm just a bit nervous the person won't pay now. Even if they don't, the next biggest offer was £2,000 which is still amazing for those two charities.' She added: 'Simon thinks it's great, he knows it's for charity. He's even trying to get a date of his own now!' The mother-of-two made the announcement to her 37,000 Twitter followers yesterday, saying she was holding an online auction for Saturday's date. Mrs Danczuk, who shot to fame after posting as series of racy selfies online, said that Manchester restaurant Tertutti has agreed to lay out a special meal for her and her lucky winner . She tweeted: 'Just realised its Valentines Day Saturday! Hmmmm should I offer one lucky person a night out for charity?? KD.' It prompted a deluge of responses from fans, with Bryn Smith posting: 'Yessss you should defo do this, I can feel a Twitter meltdown coming.' Andy Hudson tweeted: 'Sounds like a great idea, and for a good cause as well.' While Andy Futers said: 'Meee, but can I leave the wife at home and we can send a selfie of us to her.' Andrew Meaden posted: 'I'm starting with £200', while another anonymous user offered £2,000. Mrs Danczuk later added: 'Want to take me out for Valentines & raise money for charity? Email me your secret bid. Highest bidder wins! karendanczuk@hotmail.com KD.' The mother-of-two (left) said her husband Simon (right), the MP for Rochdale, has now launched his own campaign to find a date for Saturday night . The MP tweeted his followers asking for 'offers, suggestions or ideas' in light of his wife's charity campaign . Presumably inundated with offers from men, she then tweeted: 'My Charity Valentines Dinner doesn't just have to be male, females are just as welcome! KD.' The mother-of-two, who has represented the Kingsway ward on Rochdale council since 2011, announced last month that she was standing down as a councillor at the next election to pursue other opportunities. She's already hired London-based agent Ginger Comms and is understood to be interested in pursuing TV work. Mrs Danczuk also hit the headlines last year when she started selling signed pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay. But the £10 pictures were criticised by many buyers for being poor quality. In August, former Conservative MP Louise Mensch described her as 'Westminster's most embarrassing wife' and claimed she was cheapening politics for constantly posting pictures of her cleavage. She later went on to ITV's Loose Women show to defend herself against the accusations, where panelist Janet Street-Porter said she was a poor model for young girls in Rochdale. The date is raising money for Key 103 Cash For Kids, based in Manchester, and Rochdale RSPCA.","31-year-old councillor has promised to go on date with 'one lucky person'

"It's gained a reputation as a sure-fire cure for the blues - especially for those dealing with heartbreak. And now ice cream is getting a sexy makeover courtesy of British foodies, The Licktators. The London-based dessert company has created a sensual, female-only version of ice-cream which they say contains,  'a wicked triple-ripple of aphrodisiacs'. Scroll down for video . Icy pleasure: Vice Cream is a 'female-only' ice-cream that promises to heat things up in the bedroom . Th dessert is the brainchild of London-based ice-cream manufacturers The Licktators . Vice Cream is made with Ecuadorian chocolate, plant-based pleasure enhancer Lady Prelox and thick, creamy British whipping cream. According to The Licktators, the  ice-cream was created to 'give women's sexual appetites a deliciously natural boost'. The Ecuadorian chocolate, they say, will stimulate the release of serotonins, the brain's natural pleasure-enhancers. The dessert also contains a dash of Lady Prelox, a natural, plant-based pleasure enhancer made from pine bark that boosts libido and encourages blood-flow to the sexual regions. Finally, the experience is enhanced by the addition of whipped cream which, the makers say can 'be eaten, shared - or even applied to intimate areas' as things get steamy. The new ice-cream was made in the The Licktators' secret south London 'Whipping Room.' The dessert also contains a dash of Lady Prelox, a natural, plant-based pleasure enhancer that boosts libido and encourages blood-flow to the sexual regions . The company is well-known for its inventive flavour combinations and unique product names and is behind General Custard, a vanilla custard ice-cream; chocolate and praline Choc N Roll Rehab; Jiggu Pop popcorn ice-cream; cinnamon doughnut flavour Doughnut Disturb; Marshmallow Law and John Lemon, made with lemon curd and British milk and cream. Miss Whiplash, head of the The Licktator's Whipping Room, said they hope to see women 'screaming for Vice Cream on Valentine's Day'. She added: 'For many women, eating chocolate ice cream is already a sensual experience. So we thought why not turn the volume up to 11 and give all the lovely ladies out there a big, raunchy boost. 'Whether you think you need it or not, or you simply fancy recreating the ice cream scene from Fifty Shades of Grey, bringing Vice Cream into your life can only make your sex life saucier.' Lady Prelox is a dietary supplement made by German company Horphag Research. On their website they say it is meant to  'synergistically promote sexual comfort and pleasure' and was developed exclusively for women to give them a fulfilling sex life. Its makers say the product was clinically tested on more than 200 women. It contains pycnogenol, a botanical extract from the bark of the French maritime pine tree, known for its potent antioxidant properties and proven to expand and support healthy blood vessels. The product also contains branded and patented rose hip extract Rosvita, a potent antioxidant containing vitamin C, which contributes to normal psychological function an reduction of tiredness and fatigue. The other ingredients in Lady Prelox are the amino acids L-Arginine and L-Citrulline. L-Arginine plays an important role in nitric oxide mechanisms in the body. Nitric oxide is crucial for the regulation of blood flow to the genital area and plays a critical role in sex drive and sexual satisfaction. L-Citrulline is naturally occurring amino acid. As a precursor of L-Arginine, it has been shown to help open up veins and arteries to improve blood flow and reduce blood pressure.","Vice Cream contains plant-based pleasure enhancer, Lady Prelox .

"Massive amounts of carbon dioxide released from the deep ocean brought an end to the last ice age, according to new research. A study examining fluctuations in ocean acidity recorded in the shells of ancient marine animals has shown how levels of carbon dioxide soared around 16,000 to 7,500 years ago. The scientists behind the research found the gas appears to have been released from hot spots in the Southern Atlantic Ocean and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, carried to the surface by currents welling up from the deep ocean. Carbon dioxide  from the deep sea may have led glaciers, like the one above, melting at the end of the ice age . They say this release of carbon dioxide from where it was trapped in the deep ocean is likely to have played a major role in the warming that lead to the melting of the ice sheets that covered much of the world. The glaciers that accompanied ice ages are responsible for carving out enormous swathes of rock on Earth, but these periods of cold weather may have built up its crust too . Colder spells caused water to be drawn up into glaciers, and in turn this caused sea levels to drop, allowing more magma to seep out from underwater eruptions. This, scientists believe, caused thicker sections of crust to emerge during the same period. The theory - published in the journal Science - suggests that during an ice age, increased amounts of water are taken up into glaciers, causing sea levels to drop by up to 330ft (100 metres). This reduces the pressure on the ocean floor, allowing magma to erupt more easily and spread across the ocean floor more easily. This occurs where plates of ocean crust move apart, allowing magma to erupt outwards into the water. On the bottom of the oceans, this forms so-called 'abyssal hills', which are ridges hundreds of metres long, separated by valleys, on plates moving away from each other. It suggests that climatic effects on the surface of Earth can have previously unknown effects on other parts of the planet. The findings help to provide new clues about how the world was transformed from being largely locked in ice to the milder climate that exists today. However, it is still unclear exactly what triggered the release of the gas from the ocean floor in the first place. Researchers claim that it could also provide insight into how the oceans can affect the climate. Dr Miguel Martinez-Boti, a paleoceanographer who led the study at the University of Southampton, said: 'The magnitude and rapidity of the swings in atmospheric CO2 across the ice age cycles suggests that changes in ocean carbon storage are important drivers of natural atmospheric CO2 variations. 'Our findings support the theory that a series of processes operating in the southernmost sector of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, a region known as the ‘Southern Ocean’, changed the amount of carbon stored in the deep-sea. 'While a reduction in communication between the deep-sea and the atmosphere in this region potentially locks carbon away from the atmosphere into the abyss during ice ages, the opposite occurs during warm interglacial periods.' The study, which is published in the journal Nature, examined the levels of boron isotopes in the fossils of microscopic plankton obtained from deep sea drilling samples. This allowed them to calculate the acidity of the ocean the plankton lived in at the time - something that is affected by astmospheric carbon dioxide levels. They found that around 16,000 to 7,500 years ago the carbon dioxide levels in surface water of the oceans southern Atlantic and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean increased signifcantly. The scientists studied the isotope levels in the shells of fossilised plankton like Globigerina bulloides above . This graph shows how dissolved carbon dioxide levels have changed from the ice age (blue dot) to the end of the ice age (red dots). EEP denotes the equatorial Pacific Ocean, SA is the South Atlantic Ocean. The solid lines show a various modern data for carbon dioxide levels found in the the world's oceans . The surface waters at these locations are known to come from water in the deep ocean upwelling. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are known to have increased at around this time from 185 parts per million but then increased to around 280 parts per million. This, say the scientists, is because the carbon dioxide welling up in water from the deep ocean was being released into the atmosphere. This would have helped to warm the climate and cause the ice trapped on the land in glaciers to melt. Dr Gavin Foster, a reader in geochemistry at the University of Southampton who was a co-author in the study, said the findings could help to explain how the ocean is effecting the climate today. Climate change scientists estimate that the deep oceans have been absorbing much of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by human activity. The above map shows modern annual average carbon dioxide levels in the world's oceans and the locations where the core samples containing the fossilised plankton were obtained that the researchers studied . This has been used to partly explain the 'pause' in global warming that has occured over the past decade. Dr Foster said: 'Just like the way the oceans have stored around 30% of humanity’s fossil fuel emissions over the last 100 years or so, our new data confirms that natural variations in atmospheric CO2 between ice ages and warm interglacials are driven largely by changes in the amount of carbon stored in our oceans. 'While our results support a primary role for the Southern Ocean processes in these natural cycles, we don’t yet know the full story and other processes operating in other parts of the ocean, such as the North Pacific, may have an additional role to play.' Dr Katherine Allen, from the department of marine and coastal sciences at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said more work was needed to understand what caused these changes in carbon dioxide in the ocean. She said: 'Somehow, during the descent into the last ice age, the CO2 balance between ocean and atmosphere was tipped in favour of the ocean. After the ice age, CO2 levels rose again, implying that the balance must have tipped back. 'These exciting hints regarding ocean–atmosphere carbon exchange raise further questions. 'Additional records are now needed to cover the other half of the glacial cycle: the descent into the ice age.'","Researchers at the University of Southampton studied fossilised plankton .
They found acidity in ocean surface water soared 16,000 to 7,500 years ago .
They suggest currents carried the carbon dioxide up from the deep ocean .
This allowed the gas to escape into the atmosphere and trigger warming .
Scientists say the finding provides new clues about what ended the ice age .
However what triggered the release of the carbon dioxide is still unclear ."
"A heavily pregnant woman was forced to undergo a humiliating medical examination on a packed plane to prove that she was fit to fly. Kerry Deane was horrified when staff on the Thomson Holidays flight ordered her to the front of the plane in front of passengers to be checked by two doctors in an area where food is prepared. Miss Deane, who was 35 weeks pregnant, and showing no signs of going into labour, was eventually escorted off the flight with her partner and three young children. This was despite the 32-year-old carrying documentation from her GP stating that she was fit to travel. Kerry Deane, pictured with her son Hudson, was forced to undergo a humiliating internal exam at the front of the plane after flight staff apparently decided she was too close to her due date to fly . Then, instead of the usual four-hour flight from Tunisia to Glasgow, the family had to endure a 19-hour marathon before finally stepping through their front door. Miss Deane said: ‘The way were treated was an absolute disgrace, and we haven’t even had an apology from Thomson. ‘To say it was an ordeal is an understatement. I was upset and sobbing, but they didn’t take any notice, and just kept saying: “It’ll be OK”.’ Miss Deane, who was pregnant with son Hudson, now three months old, was due to fly out of Tunisia after a week away when she was approached on board and told that she had to be examined by medical staff based at Enfidha airport. The women doctors took her blood pressure and checked her bump, before carrying out an intrusive examination in the plane’s front galley. Miss Deane said: ‘They didn’t carry out the examination in any sort of sterile way. ‘And I can’t believe we were thrown off the plane as it was obvious I was not in labour.’ She said she was left fearing she would have to stay in Tunisia to give birth. ‘How do you get home from Tunisia if you cannot fly?’ Miss Deane said. ‘I was thinking, I’m stuck here for at least seven weeks. What about my children? I only had a week’s clothes.’ Ms Deane, 32, had checked she would be okay to fly (boarding pass pictured left) - and even had a note from her doctors showing she was under the 36 week cut off (right) Ms Deane said the experience left her humiliated - but Thomson, which was not operating the flight that day, have refused to take any responsibility . After being taken off the plane last September, Miss Deane, her partner and children Broxon, ten, Alicia, nine, and Garyn, six, then endured a 19-hour ordeal to get home. First they had a lengthy wait for a flight to Newcastle – rather than their preferred destination of Glasgow. As a result they then had to sit on a minibus to get to their home in Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire. NHS advice states that it is normally safe to fly while you are pregnant - but it is the airlines which decide whether or not to let you fly towards the end. British Airways says it restricts travel beyond the end of the 36th week, while people carrying twins or triplet cannot fly beyond the end of the 32nd week. However, the airline does say it would like women to carry a doctors note after the 28th week, confirming due date and the fact it isn't complicated. Easyjet allows mothers to fly until the 35th week, and women carrying twins until the 32nd. RyanAir has the same cut off dates as BA, and asks mothers to carry the letter from 28 weeks - but says it reserves the right to refuse travel from this point if they don't have one. Emirates asks for letter after the 29th week, but has the same cut off dates as BA. Miss Deane said that the family was not offered any vouchers for food or water while they waited for the later flight, and said she ran up a £100 phone bill calling relatives in distress. She added: ‘You go with these big companies because you think they have procedures, but it means nothing. ‘It’s crazy. The whole situation shows how you have no rights. We cannot protect ourselves.’ Before flying, Miss Deane had sought the advice of her GP on four occasions, and said she checked with Thomson as instructed by their staff because she was concerned about the timing of the holiday, which she had booked before she was aware she was pregnant. She said she even requested her GP to fax to Thomson’s headquarters documentation permitting her to fly. However, Thomson, whose rules state a woman can fly up to 36 weeks pregnant, has distanced itself from the incident, claiming that the flight was operated by a third party. A spokesman said: ‘We are sorry to hear of Miss Deane’s experience on the return from her holiday in Tunisia. ‘On this occasion the flight was not operated by us but by a third party airline. As every airline has its own policy regarding flying during pregnancy we advised Miss Deane to speak directly to this airline prior to travel to avoid any potential issues. ‘As we understand Miss Deane has instructed a solicitor, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'","Kerry Deane, from Glasgow, had been enjoying a holiday with her family .
The 32-year-old was 35 weeks pregnant - within Thomson's 36 week cut-off .
Despite having a doctor's note, she was made to undergo an examination .

"Family, friends and former co-stars came together to honour the 'generous thoughtful and fabulous' Lynda Bellingham at a touching memorial service in London today. Her husband, Michael Pattemore, was joined by actresses Amanda Redman, Lesley Joseph and actor Christopher Biggins, at St Stephen's Church this afternoon. Bellingham, best known for her long-running role as the mother in the Oxo TV adverts, died in her husband's arms in October after losing her battle with colon cancer. The service of thanksgiving was held at the church that Bellingham and Pattemore married in 2008. Scroll down for video . Family: Husband Michael Pattemore, centre, arrived with Bellingham's sons Michael and Robbie Peluso, right, and her stepson Bradley, far left, at the memorial service at St Stephen's Church, London, this afternoon .

Touching: The back of the order of service was printed with a collage of personal photos of Bellingham . Remembered: Author Lynda La Plante (left) was among those who gathered to pay tribute to Bellingham . Mr Pattemore, who has spoken of his struggle to cope with his wife's death, arrived at the church with her sons, Michael and Robbie Peluso. Actors Christopher Biggins and Lesley Joseph, who read a poem Bellingham had written to her husband called Remember, were among the guests. Actors Robin Askwith, Amanda Redman, Patricia Hodge and novelist Lynda La Plante were also among those who came to say a fond farewell. Guests were given simple programmes for the service, with a photo of Bellingham printed on the front and a collage of personal pictures with family and friends on the back. Loose Women star Bellingham made headlines before her death when she announced she had decided to end her treatment to limit the amount of suffering her family would witness. In her final weeks, she spoke openly about her illness and its effect on her family. Her book - There's Something I've Been Dying to Tell You - discussed her illness in detail and spent weeks at the top of the best-seller lists. Stage stars: Patricia Hodge, left, who shared the stage with Lynda Bellingham in the stage adaptation of Calendar Girls in 2008, and actress Lesley Joseph, right, who appeared with Bellingham on Loose Women . Moving: Gyles Brandreth, left, Bellingham's friend of 40 years, before he paid tribute to the actress in a touching speech.

Close: Actor Nickolas Grace, who had been friends with Bellingham for 48 years, and Amanda Redman (right), who starred with Bellingham in the TV programme At Home With The Braithwaites, . One of the few tearful moments in the service was when Mr Pattemore told the 300-strong congregation that he clearly remembers his wedding day when 'my heart was bursting with happiness and now we are here again and my heart is bursting with sadness'. He fought back tears and added: 'It breaks my heart that the one thing I could not protect her from was this disease called cancer.' To warm applause Gyles Brandreth told the congregation 'love, laughter and friendship, those are the gifts Lynda gave us. Haven't we been blessed?' She was remembered as a thoughtful, maternal, generous and fabulous woman who was also a natural clown. To more laughter Mr Brandreth also insisted that she could also dance no matter what the judges on the TV show Strictly Come Dancing said. Friends: Former Pan's People dancer Babs Powell, left, and Janet Suzman, right, whom she played opposite in the Old Vic’s production of The Sisters Rosensweig in 1994-1995 .

Lighthearted: Goerge Lyton, left, who starred with Bellingham in Confessions Of A Driving Instructor, attended the service with his family, pictured together outside the church . He spoke of Bellingham's career, which spanned TV and stage including Shakespeare, Calendar Girls, the sitcom Faith In The Future, All Creatures Great And Small and '16 years on the Oxo gravy train'. Despite her successful comedy roles, it should not forgotten that Bellingham was a good actress and writer, he claimed. 'Her control and artistry would take your breath away,' he said. He jokingly described the bubbly actress as 'so sexy that even gay men fancied her, and she fancied them too'. Mr Brandreth added: 'She fancied Biggins - I think that is why Michael has come in one of Biggins's cast-offs. 'She showed us how to live and then how to die with such grace and kindness.' Final moments: Lynda Bellingham died in the arms of husband Michael Pattemore, pictured together, aged 66 . Open: Bellingham (far right) spoke to Loose Women co-stars Janet Street-Porter (far right) and Coleen Nolan about her battle with cancer . Biggins said that the laughter is the thing that he would always remember about her. He said: 'She would have loved this full house and would have loved the laughter we have had. God bless you Lynda. We love you.' Peter Delaney, who conducted the service which was joking dubbed as the second meeting of the Lynda Bellingham Appreciation Society after her funeral, noted that she had handpicked the details of how the event was to play out. He joked: 'The contents of this service are Lynda's wishes because she planned her farewells. She was not a control freak but she like to know what was going on.' Iconic: The actress was best known for her long-running role as the mother in the Oxo TV advert, pictured . Classic: Lynda Bellingham with Robin Askwith in a scene from 1976 film Confessions Of A Driving Instructor . Bellingham's charity work was recalled and there was also a call to help the oncologist who treated her. Through the order of service Bellingham's family asked for donations to be made to Action Against Cancer 'so the wonderful Professor Justin Stebbing, who we both admired and loved, may carry on his great work'. The tune There's No Business Like Showbusiness brought smiles to those who had come to pay their respects as it was piped out over the organ and brought the service to an end.","Lynda Bellingham died in October after losing battle with colon cancer .

"A notorious thief dubbed the 'Worm Burglar' because he crawled on his stomach to avoid infra-red alarm systems has been jailed for four-and-a-half-years. Leigh Cassidy, 47, carried out a string of burglaries across the Greater Manchester area by wriggling along the floor to avoid activating the alarms. During his spree between March 2013 and May last year, he targeted five pubs in Manchester and one in New Mills, Derbyshire, stealing £7,000 from fruit machines and causing £5,840 worth of damage. Leigh Cassidy, 47, from Stockport, carried out a string of burglaries at pubs across the Greater Manchester area by wriggling along the floor (pictured) of each premise to avoid activating the infra-red alarm system . During his spree between March 2013 and May last year, Cassidy (shown in CCTV) targeted five pubs in Manchester and one in Derbyshire, stealing £7,000 from fruit machines and causing £5,840 worth of damage . Among those pubs targeted were The Hinds Head, The Wilfred Wood and The Moor Top in Stockport, The Famous Trevor Arms in Chorlton and The Sidings in Levenshulme, Manchester. Cassidy, of Stockport, was sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to four-and-a-half years in prison today after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to burglary. The court heard how he would use his belly to slither along the floors of various pubs to get to the gambling machines. After staking out each pub to assess the alarm system, Cassidy - occasionally with an accomplice - would cover the CCTV cameras of the targeted premises with plastic bags before returning at night. He would then either completely remove windows with a crowbar or smash through so he could enter and wriggle his way across the floor to the fruit machines. He had realised that if he remained below the 'line of sight' of burglar alarm beams that he could remain undetected. Cassidy was eventually caught when police spoke to his girlfriend Cheryl O'Donnell and she admitted he would leave the house carrying a rucksack and tools and return with a large amount of coins. When he poured out £1,000 in coins in front of her, he told her to tell police that 'it was her savings' if they asked about it. Phillip Barnes, prosecuting, said: 'The aim of the burglaries was to target fruit machines, which were typically forced open and emptied of cash. 'The burglaries were in the early morning when the public houses themselves were less likely to be occupied and the machines more likely to be full. 'In the majority of the cases, although the public areas were empty, the homes above, within the same buildings, were occupied by the landlords or tenants. 'The offender or offenders would be seen to be wearing gloves and face coverings of various sorts and carrying bags. 'On a number of occasions CCTV cameras were covered with bags in advance. Cassidy (pictured), had already clocked up 181 previous convictions when he carried out the nine raids. He was sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to a four-and-a-half year prison sentence today . 'The modus operandi involved crawling or sliding through pubs below the 'line of sight' of alarm system beams and then turning machines to shield the thief from the beam picking him up and triggering the alarm.' One pub, the Wilfred Wood, near Stockport, was burgled on three separate occasions. During the first raid on November 11 2013, Cassidy was caught on CCTV climbing a drainpipe and covering the CCTV camera with a plastic bag. The window frame was then removed from the back door and, while an accomplice waited outside, Cassidy crawled around all three fruit machines and broke into them. He also attempted to steal alcohol from behind the bar which set the alarm off at 5.30am. Following an hour in the pub, Cassidy made off with £1,100 and caused £280 of damage. He later targeted the Queens Head in New Mill, Derbyshire, where more than £400 was stolen from a fruit machine. He was later chased by police during his getaway. Mr Barnes said: 'Two males were seen walking to the train station and boarding the train at around 6am, one being this defendant. 'The train from New Mills to Manchester was stopped by British Transport Police but Cassidy pulled the emergency cord and managed to escape. 'Recovered on the train in a bag was brandy, charity sweets, £21 from the charity box, crisps and around £350 in cash from the fruit machine as well as tools and gloves.' Mr Barnes added that the morning after each burglary Cassidy would deposit large amounts of money into his NatWest bank account in Manchester city centre - via a machine used for counting large quantities of coins and change. The Famous Trevor Arms pub in Chorlton, Greater Manchester (above) was among those targeted by Cassidy . In a statement read to the court, Steven Clough, the landlord of the Wilfred Wood pub, said he felt 'frustrated, angry and victimised'. 'I felt helpless that he kept doing this,' he added. Sandra Booth, the landlady of The Sidings in Levenshulme, Manchester, said: 'I'm angry, upset and frustrated. Angry that he feels it is okay to break into our home like this. 'We now have extra security and we're so upset the charity box was stolen. This type of crime is the lowest of the low.' In mitigation, defence counsel Paul Bryning said: 'There is no trauma to any victims beyond the inevitable. 'Overall there is limited damage and disturbance. Perhaps it is no surprise to learn he has a history of addiction to Class A drugs. The addiction stems from issues from his childhood in the care system.' The court heard how the serial burglar had already clocked up 181 previous convictions. He first got into trouble at the age of 11 and was first locked up at the age of 14. Sentencing Cassidy, the judge Mr Recorder Graham Smith said: 'The burglaries follow a very general and specific pattern. You target the place in the early hours of the morning with relatively sophisticated planning to obscure the CCTV cameras, then either break or remove from the window the glass and slide across the floor to avoid detection. Sandra Booth, landlady of The Sidings in Levenshulme, Manchester (pictured) said she was 'angry, upset and frustrated' that Cassidy had broken into her premises and stolen cash from the fruit machine and charity tin . 'You then move the fruit machine to deflect the security beam and take the contents of the machine, and it seems, on other occasions, you have taken items including alcohol, crisps, sweets and small items of cash from charity or staff tips. 'You acknowledge that what you have done is completely wrong and you know you will be sent to prison. I do have regard to your difficult childhood which has led to a cycle of behaviour which has been described as ""self-sabotaging"". 'I know from experience in this court and outside that it is possible to break free from this behaviour even while in prison and there are signs of encouragement. 'Before this period you went for over one year without offending which may not sound a long time but given your background that was significant. 'I urge you to take every opportunity available to you to see if you can break free.' Following the sentencing, detective constable Adele Coulter said: 'Thankfully, we received information he had been involved in a burglary using the same tactic and we managed to link him with the remaining crimes. 'Cassidy thought he was being clever and was getting away with it but it goes to show that crime does not pay and you will be brought to justice eventually.'","Leigh Cassidy carried out string of burglaries across Greater Manchester .

"Fifty Shades of Grey kicked off the ‘mommy porn’ phenomenon and is seen as a bit of saucy fun. But two evangelical Christians are calling on women to mail them their copies of the EL James bestseller in exchange for a free guide explaining how readers can achieve ‘spiritual’ sexual fulfillment instead, by turning to the Bible for guidance. Dr Juli Slattery, 45, from Colorado Springs, and Dannah Gresh, from State College, Pennsylvania, are authors of Pulling Back the Shades: Erotica, Intimacy and the Longings of A Women’s Heart, which is so popular it initially sold out on Amazon. Authors: Evangelical Christians Dr Juli Slattery (left) and Dannah Gresh (right) are calling on women to mail them their Fifty Shades of Grey books in exchange for the  free 'spiritual' Bible-based sex guide . In less than two weeks, the authors' team says nearly 350 people have signed up for their ‘Trade your Shades’ promotion that ends on Valentine’s Day - the same day the Fifty Shades of Grey movie hits theaters. Dr Slattery and Mrs Gresh say they wrote their book after realizing that members of their own evangelical community were hooked on the Fifty Shades series. Mrs Gresh - a sexuality educator who refuses to read the novels - says she was horrified to learn that ‘praying grandmas’ and ‘pastors’ wives’ were reading about bondage and the sexual adventures of the fictitious Ana Steele and Christian Grey. ‘The Fifty Shades phenomenon has done for women what internet porn did for men: fuel its use and normalize it,’ says Dr Slattery. ‘It’s time to add the Bible’s view on sex and intimacy and the spiritual road into meeting a woman’s deepest human needs and wants.’ Success: According to the book's authors, nearly 350 people in less than two weeks have signed up for their ‘Trade your Shades’ promotion that ends on Valentine’s Day . Dr Slattery is a psychologist and a married mother-of-three who read the EL James novels as research before writing Pulling Back the Shades. Although she was appalled by what she read, she says she wasn’t surprised to find she was also aroused. ‘I’m a normal person,’ she says. ‘Erotica by definition is designed to arouse. ‘So there’s no reason that I should have a different reaction than everyone else.’ But Dr Slattery warns against being sucked into a fantasy world - even if you’re a married Christian who sees it as a bit of harmless fun. ‘What it does is it teaches you to respond sexually to someone other than your partner,’ she says. ‘So just like a woman might say it’s not fair for my husband to compare me to some super airbrushed model he sees in pornographic literature, I would say the same is true when it comes to this sort of erotic fantasy. ‘It creates in your mind an appetite for something that’s not real. ‘It makes you less satisfied with the partner that you have and the good things that you have within your relationship.’ The other sort of Christian: Both authors were shocked and concerned by the widespread popularity of EL James' BDSM-based novels (pictured) Instead Dr Slattery says their book shows the link between the Bible and the sexual intimacy she believes that God intended us to have. ‘In our culture we have this Victorian view of God and of sexuality,’ she says. 'That God is good and our sexuality is very earthy and base and dirty. ‘That’s not from scripture. It’s really cultural. ‘From the time we were little we’ve been taught that our sexuality is somehow wrong and so we separate it from a pursuit of holiness.’ Instead Dr Slattery says married couples can spice up their love lives by exploring new things together, not relying on erotica or porn. ‘I think Christians should be the most sexually satisfied people in the world, because they understand God’s design for it,’ she says. Originally published in 2014, the demand for Pulling Back the Shades is so great it’s flown off the shelves. However, Dr Slattery says some evangelical Christians are upset that sex toys, masturbation and oral sex are openly discussed in her book. The psychologist and author, who started a ministry called Authentic Intimacy, says: ‘My job is to answer those kinds of questions on a daily basis. ‘So if that’s what women are asking, we want them to feel free to ask and [get an answer that] comes from a Christian perspective.’","Dr Juli Slattery, a psychologist, and Dannah Gresh, a sexuality educator, co-authored the free sex guide, which is titled 'Pulling Back the Shades'

"Chef Andrew Wright cheated nearly 200 victims after creating up a fake company which fleeced pensioners out of their life savings . A fraudster who conned more than £1.25 million out of elderly and vulnerable people and then spent five years on the run has finally been brought to justice. Chef Andrew Wright cheated nearly 200 victims after creating up a fake company which fleeced pensioners out of their life savings. When detectives began investigating his dealings in 2009 he fled from Spain, where he co-ran the firm with an accomplice, to Malaysia. The 64-year-old evaded arrest until May last year when he was detained at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. He had flown into the country for a catering trade show and his name flagged up under a European arrest warrant. Derby Crown Court was told the company CGI, which used a UK address, cold-called elderly and vulnerable people and asked them to invest in fraudulent businesses. They lied about their achievements and prospects for making profits and raked in a total of £1,267,724 through the con. From this huge sum, CGI benefitted £480,000. The conmen made people believe they were speaking to someone from a company based in the UK and not in Spain. Between November 2007 and August 2009, CGI made about 43,000 calls to 12,500 numbers, which equated to about 31 days of time on the phone. But in 2009 the Derbyshire force began investigating the fake firm and both Wright and Hogan fled the country. A European arrest warrant was issued for Wright in April 2012, but it was another two years before he was caught. Arrest warrants are flagged up at passport control and the fraudster was arrested by Dutch border guards after his jet touched down last May. Wright, who contested the warrant, was kept in Dutch custody until being brought over to the UK in August. He admitted conspiring to defraud together with Paul Hogan, who is still on the run, between November 2007 and August 2009, and has been jailed for four years and eight months. Following the case, Detective Constable Rich Foster, of Derbyshire police's economic crime unit, said: 'This was a long, painstaking investigation into a fraud that left nearly 200 victims across the country, including Derbyshire, facing serious financial losses. 'Our pursuit of this criminal in a number of countries and over several years proves how seriously we take this kind of offence, and I'm pleased that we have been able to bring one of the ringleaders in this operation to justice.' Derby Crown Court was told the company CGI, which used a UK address, cold-called elderly and vulnerable people and asked them to invest in fraudulent businesses . DC Foster, who was the investigating officer in the case, said in 2009 a restraint order was put on Wright's bank account, which contained thousands of pounds. 'So he knew at this point we wanted to speak to him and he fled to Malaysia,' said DC Foster. The officer said the fraud had been devastating to many people. 'All the victims were vulnerable - the majority elderly - and some have lost their life savings, their pension schemes or been persuaded to cash in previous investments and shares which were genuine to pay for these fraudulent ones,' said DC Foster. 'Others took out bank loans to get the money.' He said that many of the victims felt foolish for having been drawn in by Wright and his accomplice. DC Foster said: 'They very much feel ashamed that they have been persuaded to do this when they should have known better, and embarrassed that they were taken in, but they were professional fraudsters who knew what they were doing and saying.' DC Foster said they had begun the process to extradite Wright's partner in the fraud, Hogan, who was originally from the UK but now believed to be living in Australia. The conmen made people believe they were speaking to someone from a company based in the UK and not in Spain. Wright fled Javea, Spain, where he co-ran the firm with an accomplice, to Malaysia . Jailing Wright, of no fixed address but previously of Derbyshire, for four years and eight months, Judge John Burgess said: 'It was a classic boiler room fraud. It was sophisticated. 'The company fell to pieces in 2009, no doubt because authorities in this country were on to you and it became very much more difficult to find customers wanting to invest. You went to Malaysia and worked there.' The judge said that Wright, who previously worked as a chef in Derby, must have taken 'a degree of care' to make sure the authorities did not find him. Judge Burgess said the fact Wright contested the warrant made him take a 'somewhat cynical' view of Wright's expressions of remorse in his letter to the judge. Philip Bown, in mitigation, said that before Wright had been detained last year he had not known that a European arrest warrant had been issued. Mr Bown said: 'He has led a law-abiding and fairly successful life in the food industry - that's where his expertise lies. He has travelled widely and has been employed all over the world and has a hard work ethic.' The lawyer told the court that the fraudulent venture of CGI had been the one blip in his client's hard-working career and that he had been 'seduced by the money'. In his letter to the judge, Wright wrote: 'The more intricate the web around you, the more difficult it is to get out.'","Chef Andrew Wright cheated nearly 200 victims with a fake company .

"Drink-related early death rates among low paid workers like bar staff, cleaners and labourers are four times higher than well-paid professionals, a new study showed today. Total death rates linked to alcohol have fallen to their lowest level since 2000, the Office for National Statistics said. But there are 'substantial' differences between ages and jobs with those in 'routine occupations' likely to have higher death rates and lose more potential years of working life because of alcohol-related deaths. In 2011, alcohol-related death rates were highest for those in routine occupations such as bar staff, cleaners and labourers, with 29.5 and 12.6 deaths per 100,000 men and women respectively . Those in routine occupations tended to have higher death rates and lose more potential years of working life because of alcohol-related deaths . In 2013 there were 8,416 alcohol-related deaths registered in the UK, equivalent to a rate of 14 deaths per 100,000 people. It is the lowest rate since 2000, when it stood at 13.1 per 100,000. Two thirds of all deaths linked to alcohol were among men. For both sexes, death rates were highest among those aged 60-64 years (45.3 deaths per 100,000 men and 22.4 per 100,000 women). The ONS said that alcohol-related death among men increased steadily across age groups, rising from 0.3 per 100,000 population for those aged 20-24 to a peak of 45.3 per 100,000 for those aged 60-64 years. For women, the lowest death rate was among those aged 20-24 (0.2 per 100,000) and highest was among 60-64 year olds (22.4 per 100,000). Death rates were similar among men and women for those aged 20-24 and 85-89. But in all other age groups, the alcohol-related death rate for men was approximately twice that of women. For those aged 90 years and over, the rate for men was three times higher than that of women. Total death rates linked to alcohol have fallen to their lowest level since 2000, the Office for National Statistics said . A linked study released today examined how death rates varied between people in differing jobs. The ONS said the latest analysis shows 'substantial socio-economic and gender inequality in alcohol-related deaths among working-age adults'. 'Those in routine occupations tended to have higher death rates and lose more potential years of working life because of alcohol-related deaths than those in more advantaged socio-economic classes,' the ONS said. In 2011, alcohol-related death rates were highest for those in routine occupations such as bar staff, cleaners and labourers, with 29.5 and 12.6 deaths per 100,000 men and women respectively. The ONS said that alcohol-related death among men increased steadily across age groups, rising from 0.3 per 100,000 population for those aged 20-24 to a peak of 45.3 per 100,000 for those aged 60-64 years . By contrast rates were lowest for those working in higher managerial and professional occupations like doctors, IT strategy and planning professionals and lawyers, with 7.3 deaths per 100,000 men and 5.2 deaths per 100,000 women. 'This meant that alcohol-related death rates for those in routine occupations were four times greater for men and two times greater for women, than those in professional roles,' the ONS added. The largest difference between the sexes was among semi-routine occupations, which includes veterinary nurses, traffic wardens and security guards. In this group of workers, the rate was almost three times greater for men than women. In contrast, the higher managerial and professional occupations were the only class without a significant gender difference in the alcohol-related death rates. Elaine Hindal, Chief Executive of alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'It's encouraging to see that alcohol related deaths are at their lowest since 2000. 'However it's concerning to see the continued trend of alcohol related deaths disproportionately affecting men and those who work in more manual occupations. 'This is particularly worrying because ONS data shows that despite those in higher managerial and professional jobs drinking more, those they employ are more likely to die from alcohol related cause. This may be because those workers are more likely to have poorer overall health and are less likely to seek medical advice at the first sign of symptoms.'","Total death rates linked to alcohol fall to the lowest level since 2000 .

"After 80 astounding years, Tom and Jean Cheetham are yet to have grown  sick of each other - in fact - they are as adorably affectionate as the day they first met on a blind date. They may be Australia's oldest couple but Tom, 103, and Jean, 100, still act like love-struck teenagers - holding hands, constantly complimenting one another and saying the 'L' word as much as possible. With Valentine's Day just around the corner, Daily Mail Australia thought it only made sense to ask the country's cutest centenarians the secret to their relationship success. Tom, 103, and Jean 100, Cheetham have been together for 80 years and counting . The country's cutest centenarians got married 76 years ago in 1938 and have never looked back . The loved-up pair hold hands as much as possible - while walking, sitting and even watching TV . A new survey released by Groupon for Valentine's Day reveals that 65 per cent of Aussies believe their relationship will last over 50 years, despite the average marriage lasting just 12 years. And these enduring love birds know just how to make that happen. The first handy love tip the couple offered was to never turn down the offer of a blind date. The pair met eight decades ago when Tom's mate was dating Jean's sister - the foursome took a row boat out from The Spit to Roseville and back in Sydney's north shore - and they have been inseparable ever since. They got married four years later in 1938  and bought a home two days before the wedding for about 1,000 pounds in the now affluent north shore suburb of Mosman. The family home, that had barely changed since they purchased it, was just sold in December for a tidy $1.62million. They bought a home just before the wedding for 1,000 pounds in the now affluent Sydney suburb of Mosman . The family home, that had barely changed since they purchased it, was just sold in December for a tidy $1.62million. The fiercely independent couple reluctantly moved into a retirement home in October after Tom fractured his pelvis and shoulder. Daughter-in-law Anne Cheetham, who is married to their only son Kevin, said they didn't think Tom was going to pull through after the bad fall. 'We didn't think he would make it but he bounced back to the way he used to be - it's incredible,' she said told Daily Mail Australia. 'Until then Tom used to walk up the street to do the shopping everyday but Jean is a bit unsteady on her feet so he would do everything  - he had just recently bought a new mower,' she said. 'We would get in cleaners and people to mow the lawns but he would dismiss them because they never did a good enough job.' The first handy love tip they offered was to never turn down the offer of a blind date which is how they met . The couple have two children, Pam, 74, and Kevin, 70, four grandchildren, nine great grandchildren and three great great grandchildren. Tom worked at what is now Australia Post for 49 years and ten months and Jean started out as a milliner but then worked as a florist for more than half a century. The strength of their relationship has required a commitment of hard work from the delightful duo. 'They are willing to listen to each other - they have similar ideas anyway - they have a strong sense of loyalty and they treat each other nicely,' Anne said. 'They are like two peas in a pod - of course they get cross with each other from time to time but they are always together.' 'It sounds cliche but they don't take each other for granted.' The cute couple are naturally very affectionate with each other and their loved ones and think people should to hold hands as much as they can. 'They always do that when walking along the street and even hold hands while they are sitting down watching TV,' Anne laughs. Another golden rule that the charming couple abide by is to never break promises . Tom and Jean say its best to regularly tell your partner you love them and what it is that you love about them . Another golden rule that the couple abide by is to never break promises. 'They have strong views about that - maybe it was their upbringing and they learnt by example,' Anne said. 'They did it tough when they were young that can keep you together. 'It's simple things like never competing with one another - there is no competition between them.' As one in four Australians say they need help when communicating with their partner - Tom and Jean advise to regularly tell your partner that you love them and what it is that you love about them. 'Jean loves Tom's blue eyes and is always telling everybody she loves him,' Anne said. 'She's always telling us she loves us too.' Anne is not sure why the pair have lived such long and healthy lives. 'They liked to do a lot of walking and neither of them are on any medication,' she said. 'They are not big drinkers and don't smoke - they were never party people.' So, how long will this endearing pair kick on for - can they make another decade? 'Well we've written them into our will,' the 71 year-old joked. 'I think it will be a case of when one goes so will the other.' The couple have two children, Pam, 74, and Kevin, 70, four grandchildren, nine great grandchildren and three great great grandchildren . The cute couple are naturally very affectionate with each other and their loved ones - therefore suggesting couples to hold hands as much as they can .","Tom, 103 and Jean Cheetham, 100, have been together for 80 years .

"A millionaire pilot and his girlfriend were killed when their private plane ran out of fuel, an inquest heard. Cost-conscious Gary Vickers, 58, and Kay Clarke, 42, were returning from a shopping trip to Paris when their twin-engined Cessna smashed into the ground as they came in to land. Hotel owner Mr Vickers, described as ‘sensitive to fuel economy’, had discovered he could get fuel for 9p a litre cheaper in Britain than in France. Scroll down for video . Killed: Gary Vickers (right) and his girlfriend Kay Clarke died when their twin-engined Cessna smashed into the ground at Hawarden airport near Chester. An inquest heard Mr Vickers bought less fuel to save money . Before taking off from Paris, he filled his plane’s two main fuel tanks to 244 litres of their 386-litre capacity. But he had underestimated how long the trip would take and one of the engines ran dry. There was enough fuel in the two spare tanks to cover the extra flying time – but Mr Vickers didn’t deploy them. He was known for using a dipstick to test the fuel levels rather than relying on the fuel gauges, according to an Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report. It also stated he had failed to take wind speed into account while plotting the doomed flight on a tablet computer. Wreckage: As one engine stalled plane veered to the left, going into a nosedive just moments from landing . Probe: Air Accident Investigation Branch officials at the scene. A report described Mr Vickers as ‘sensitive to fuel economy and aware of fuel prices at different airfields’. It found no evidence of a problem with the plane . This meant it had taken 45 minutes longer – using more fuel – than the two hours and 15 minutes he had anticipated. The AAIB described Mr Vickers as being ‘very sensitive to fuel economy and aware of fuel prices at different airfields’. It found no evidence of a problem with the plane. His father Gordon – a close friend of former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott – had suggested the fuel gauges could have been faulty as his son was ‘extremely meticulous’. The hotelier and Miss Clarke, who lived together in an £800,000 house in Chester, were returning from France in November 2013. Mr Vickers, who was divorced with two grown-up children, had phoned their destination airport, Hawarden, near Chester, and found he could buy cheaper fuel there than in France. He added some fuel to the plane’s main tanks at Lognes-Emerainville airport near Paris. He also had enough fuel for an extra 45 minutes’ flying time in the spare tanks. But as the Cessna approached the Flintshire runway at 1pm, it veered to the left, flipped over and nose-dived before smashing into pieces. Miss Clarke’s (left) mother Angela, 67, said after the crash: 'They idolised each other, and Gary (right) would never have put Kay’s life in danger.’ Mr Vickers had flown for 17 years and clocked up 300 hours in the air . Mr Vickers died at the scene. Miss Clarke, a former care worker, died in hospital from internal bleeding. The couple had been together for seven years after first meeting at his family hotel, The Mill Hotel and Spa in Chester. He also owned property in Andorra and Gibraltar. The AAIB report concluded ‘the crash was caused by ‘fuel starvation which resulted from mismanagement of the aircraft’s fuel system’. A verdict of accidental death was recorded yesterday by Coroner John Gittins, in Ruthin, North Wales. Miss Clarke’s mother Angela, 67, said after the crash: ‘They idolised each other.’","Twin-engine Cessna crashed killing Gary Vickers, 58, and Kay Clarke, 42 .

"From sending mirrors into space to injecting sulphur into the atmosphere, scientists have developed an increasing array of techniques to battle climate change. But this type of ‘climate engineering’ – which involves manipulating the natural processes after emissions have been released – is only a quick and cheap fix, according to a new report. In the long run, such drastic geoengineering measures are 'irrational and irresponsible' and could ultimately damage the planet, a US panel of scientists has said. From aerosols iron fertilisation of the sea (left) to cloud seeding and greening deserts (right), scientists are conjuring up an increasing array of geoengineering techniques to battle climate change. But this type of ‘climate engineering’ could ultimately damage the planet, a new report says . However, the scientists add that some geoengineering concept should be tried out  in small projects to learn more about the risks. 'There is no substitute for dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change,' said the National Research Council in a two-part report on proposed climate-intervention techniques. 'If society ultimately decides to intervene in Earth's climate, any actions should be informed by a far more substantive body of scientific research, including ethical and social dimensions, than is presently available.' The Washington-based panel urged against 'albedo-modification technologies, which aim to increase the ability of Earth or clouds to reflect incoming sunlight,' saying they 'pose considerable risks and should not be deployed at this time.' The Washington-based panel urged against 'albedo-modification', which aim to increase the ability of Earth or clouds to reflect incoming sunlight,' saying they 'pose considerable risks and should not be deployed . Such techniques would only temporarily mask the warming effect caused by high CO2 concentrations, and present serious known and possible unknown environmental, social, and political risks, said the report. Afforestation: This technique would irrigate deserts, such as those in Australia and North Africa, to plant millions of trees that could absorb carbon dioxide. Drawback: This vegetation would also draw in sunlight that the deserts currently reflect back into space, and so contribute to global warming. Artificial ocean upwelling: Engineers would use long pipes to pump cold, nutrient-rich water upward to cool ocean-surface waters. Drawback: If this process ever stopped it could cause oceans to rebalance their heat levels and rapidly change the climate. Ocean alkalinisation: This involves heaping lime into the ocean to chemically increase the absorption of carbon dioxide. Drawback: Study suggests it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures. Ocean iron fertilisation: The method involves dumping iron into the oceans to improve the growth of photosynthetic organisms that can absorb carbon dioxide. Drawback: Study suggests it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures. Solar radiation management: This would reduce the amount of sunlight Earth receives, by shooting reflective sulphate-based aerosols into the atmosphere. Drawback: Carbon dioxide would still build up in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide removal is better understood 'but current technologies would take decades to achieve moderate results and be cost-prohibitive at scales large enough to have a sizeable impact,' it added. 'Direct air capture of carbon is an immature technology with only laboratory experiments carried out to date and demonstration projects in progress,' the report said. 'Technologies for storing the captured carbon are at an intermediate stage, but only prototypes exist and are not at the scale required for significant sequestration.' Other techniques such as forest restoration and low-till agriculture are 'mature, readily deployable technologies with well-known environmental consequences,' the report added. Afforestation, for instance, would irrigate deserts, such as those in Australia and North Africa, to plant millions of trees that could absorb carbon dioxide. However, this vegetation would also draw in sunlight that the deserts currently reflect back into space, and so contribute to global warming. It follows a similar report last year that found schemes to deliberately manipulate the Earth’s climate could prove useless, and at worst harmful. Researchers at the Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Germany used software to test the potential benefits and drawbacks of five different geoengineering technologies. Their study suggests that even when several technologies are combined, geoengineering would be unable to prevent average surface temperatures from rising more than 2°C (3.6°F) above current temperatures by the year 2100. ‘The long-term consequences and side effects of these methods have not been adequately studied,’ said Dr David Keller from the Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany. One strategy, known as afforestation, would irrigate deserts, such as those in Australia and North Africa, to plant millions of trees that could absorb carbon dioxide. Such techniques would only temporarily mask the warming effect caused by high CO2 concentrations, said the report .","Geoengineering is the deliberate manipulation of environmental processes .
