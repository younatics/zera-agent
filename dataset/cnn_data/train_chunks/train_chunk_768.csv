More than four in ten children in some areas were yesterday denied their preferred secondary school amid mounting competition for places. Tens of thousands of ten and 11-year-olds found they had  missed out as allocations were announced by councils across the country. Many areas reported a rise in the number of applicants and a corresponding decline in the number of pupils being assigned their first choice schools. Thousands of 10 and 11-year-olds across the country face discovering they have failed to get into the school of their choice today as top secondary schools say they are more oversubscribe than ever . The allocations to more than half a million families are likely to see a surge in appeals. Law firm Maxwell Gillott warned the system can be a ‘minefield’ for parents. Research by the Mail shows a booming population in many towns and cities is fuelling rising demand for secondary places. In . London, where the demand for secondary school places rose 5 per cent in . a year, 31 per cent of youngsters were rejected by their first choice . school – up slightly on last year. Fierce competition: As pressure on the best school grows, families are turning to secret tutoring for children . Education minister David Laws said 'sharp-elbowed parents' who push to get their children into the best schools should not be criticised . This rose to 42 per cent in the boroughs of Westminster and Hammersmith & Fulham and 41 per cent in Wandsworth. In . Bristol, the population of secondary school age youngsters shot up 8 . per cent, leaving 23 per cent of children without their first choice . school – compared with 18 per cent in 2013. ‘The . rise in reception pupil numbers seen in 2007/08 is starting to filter . through to secondary schools. Michael Gove has chosen a state secondary school for his daughter. Beatrice, ten, has secured a place at Grey Coat Hospital School, a Church of England girls’ comprehensive in Westminster – her first choice. Mr Gove is believed to be the first Tory Education Secretary to choose a state secondary for his child. The minister and his wife, Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, are said to be ‘delighted’. Founded in 1698, Grey Coat Hospital School specialises in languages and is typically at least five times oversubscribed for places. 'There has also been general population . growth in the area,’ said a spokesman. In . Birmingham, where applications also rose, 30 per cent were rejected by . their first choice – up from 26 per cent. Buckinghamshire, meanwhile, . was unable to offer places to 22 per cent. Around one in seven youngsters are expected to miss out on first choice schools. Under . the admissions system, parents list their school  preferences. They are . then allocated places according to the schools’ admissions criteria, . which are mainly based on a family’s proximity. Other . factors can include random lotteries or ability banding – measures . aimed at preventing middle-class parents playing the system by moving . into catchment areas. Banding involves all pupils being tested, with a . set number of bright, average and low ability children admitted. Competition . is particularly intense for places at grammar and faith schools, as . well as flagship free schools and academies, which are funded by the . taxpayer but free from local government interference. Tiffin . School in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, saw 1,863 boys sitting the . 11-plus test, competing for 160 places. Popular: The Tiffin School in Kingston is an oversubscribed grammar - 1,863 boys applied for just 160 places . The West London Free School, in Hammersmith, had nearly 10 applicants for each of its 120 places . The West London Free School, . founded by journalist Toby Young, had 1,124 applications for 120 places. Matt . Richards, senior director of www.schoolappeals.com, said: ‘Most people . are happy with a good school, they don’t necessarily want an outstanding . school, but if there isn’t one in your area then you have a problem. ‘There are areas where schools are still failing.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Every parent deserves the chance to send their child to a good school. ‘The number of children in failing secondary schools has already fallen by a quarter of a million since 2010.’ Parents apply to a local authority for a place for their child each year, and those wanting a place at a secondary school for September 2014 had to apply by 31 October last year. Depending on where they live, families will either find out today or tomorrow where their child has been allocated a place. The schools set their own admissions criteria and admissions are dealt with by the local authority. For example, faith schools give preference to children who practise the religion of the school, while others may prioritise those with siblings already at the school or those who do well in an entrance exam. For some, study alone will not be enough - and their parents will have to appeal the school's decision (file image) Parents may list up to a certain number of schools in order of preference on their application form - in London boroughs with larger numbers of schools that can mean up to six schools, while in other areas they may be allowed to list a smaller number - for example, parents in Bristol can list a maximum of three. Unlike with primary schools, where catchment areas are all-important and house prices go up as a result, where you live is not usually as important a factor in most secondary applications. There is no guarantee that children will be offered a place at their first or even third choice school - some will be offered a place at a school they did not apply to and have no wish to go to. There is a deadline date of 17 March (in most local authority areas) for parents to respond to the offer they are given, either to accept the school place offered or to appeal a decision or place a child on a waiting list.  Places become available at schools when parents decide to send their child to a private school, look elsewhere for schools or to home-educate their children instead. Parents who have appealed a school's decision not to offer their child a place will have their appeal heard by an independent panel.  They will first check your child meets all the school's admissions criteria, and should come back to you with a decision within a week.","500,000 10-11-year-olds in England told if they have secondary school place .

Reporter Jordan Jarrett-Bryan contacted staff from his former workplace to talk about how police are perceived in Brixton . Channel 4 yesterday admitted misleading viewers with a report on policing in which the interviewees worked for the same company. In the wake of last week’s allegations of corruption and cover-up in the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry, the broadcaster commissioned a ‘vox pop’ to gauge views on the police in London. However, instead of finding a representative sample of opinion, the reporter contacted staff from the office he had worked in before joining Channel 4. The report has provoked fury from residents in Brixton, south London, who said it suggested everyone in the area distrusted the police. Tory MP Rob Wilson condemned the broadcaster, saying: ‘This is very disappointing from Channel 4 News. A distorted report could have been very unhelpful, indeed inflammatory, and I hope the people concerned have learnt an important lesson.’ The feature was screened last Thursday with the strap line: ‘Our reporter, Jordan Jarrett-Bryan, spent the day in Brixton, south London, to test out what residents there felt about the police.’ Mr Jarrett-Bryan interviewed controversial race equalities adviser Lee Jasper and five staff at the marketing agency Livity, which describes its work as youth engagement and lists Channel 4 among its clients. Only one of them, youth development mentor Naomi Brown, was credited on screen as an employee, leaving viewers to assume the others were a representative sample of residents. Their reflections on the police were overwhelmingly negative. Mr Jarrett-Bryan concluded: ‘I found little hope of change here but a community still fighting for parity.’ A resident established that the interviewees were all linked and posted his findings on a popular local website, Brixton Buzz, which broke the story. The storm forced the broadcaster to remove the report from its website. A spokesman said: ‘This was a quick turnaround project, the journalist interviewed people who live, work or were born in Brixton – who also worked for Livity. They all expressed their own individual views. We accept we should have been clear that they all worked at the same place, we should have made further enquiries and we regret this oversight.’ Writing on online message boards, viewers condemned Channel 4 for broadcasting the misleading report. One said: ‘I’m a journalist but would never dream of pulling such a stunt. It’s mind-blowingly unethical. Channel 4 should at least acknowledge that something went badly wrong. Pulling the video and stuff is not a good look for any news organisation.’ Another added: ‘It’s difficult enough to find any accurate and non-superficial reporting on Brixton, and this sort of nonsense doesn’t help.’ Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said it had received one complaint yesterday and is considering whether to launch an investigation.","Reporter spoke to people he used to work with in Brixton .

Tracks on the £50billion HS2 railway line should be laid in the north at the same time as the south, the project's chief has said. Construction work will begin on the link between London Euston and the West Midlands in 2017. But Sir David Higgins, the former chief executive of Network Rail, believes routes to and from northern cities such as Leeds and Manchester should be developed simultaneously. Development: Work on the HS2 will begin in London in 2017. But politicians and rail chiefs believe routes from northern cities such as Leeds and Manchester should be established at the same time . Mick Whelan, the General Secretary of the train driver union, told the Sunday People: 'Let's get as much of this built as possible and create a great railway. 'We believe HS2 should benefit the whole country.' Sir David will suggest bringing the project forward in the belief that a faster construction period will improve the controversial scheme's popularity. During the announcement of a report documenting the high-speed link's progress tomorrow, he will also issue an appeal to the main political parties to unite behind the scheme. Business Secretary Vince Cable has backed the accelerated timetable, saying there is a 'compelling case' to speed up the extension. Budget: At present the cost of HS2 is put at £42.6 billion, with a further £7.5 billion needed for the trains . Mr Cable made clear his support for the scheme, arguing that bringing forward the northern link could help rebalance the British economy. 'Creating jobs outside London, and closing the gap between north and south, has been one of this Government's top priorities,' he said. 'On every visit I make to the north of England, I've heard businesses and council leaders make a compelling case for getting to the north more quickly by accelerating parts of the HS2 build. 'That would ensure the economic benefits can be shared sooner by everyone around the country and deserves serious consideration by government.' The controversial system, which has sparked protests in towns such as Wendover, Buckinghmashire, would see trains running between London and Birmingham by 2026 . In contrast, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said last week that it was important that Sir David could show that costs 'have come down markedly'. Mr Balls suggested if the costs were shown to have decreased and come under control then Labour would back HS2 when it receives its second reading in the House of Commons in the coming weeks. He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: 'At every stage in this project for the next few years, because it's going to go into the next parliament when the final decision is taken, I'm going to say there's no blank cheque, the costs have got to come down, the assumptions have to be robust. 'If this is not a value for money project, it shouldn't be supported. I want to make sure the costs come down. We've not seen the report yet. 'We'll support this because I think investment in new capacity is needed north and south, and to be honest have a bigger debate about what's needed in the north and the current plans. 'We'll support it at second reading but we will continue to be vigilant, get the costs down, there's no blank cheque from the Labour government on this project.' At present the cost of HS2 is put at £42.6 billion, with a further £7.5 billion needed for the high-speed trains. The scheme's first phase will see a new line run from London through Tory heartlands to Birmingham and is scheduled to be completed in 2026. The second phase, taking the line in a Y-shape to north-west and north-east England, is set for completion around 2032/33. Launching his report in Manchester, Sir David will say that he would like work to start on the second phase at the same time as the first phase. Proposal: Business Secretary Vince Cable (left) said there was a 'compelling case' to extend HS2 to the north as quickly as possible, while Sir David Higgins (right) wants to bring the project forward . He is also expected to recommend a completely new station at Euston, the site for the line's London terminus. Sir David, who has joined HS2 Ltd after being Network Rail chief executive, is also expected to recommend scrapping plans to link HS2 with HS1, the London to Kent coast Channel Tunnel high-speed line. HS2 is facing a number of obstacles over and above strong opposition by residents who face years of disruption while the building work goes on. Mr Balls is not the only Labour politician to express reservations about the scheme. Former chancellor Alistair Darling and former industry secretary Lord Mandelson have also questioned the project's viability. In addition, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has said that the legislation for phase one of the project will not get through Parliament before next year's general election. The route to cities including Newcastle, Edinburgh, Leeds and Glasgow is not set to be running until at least 2032. The initial route between London Euston and Birmingham is set to be operational in 2026 .","Work set to start on link between London and Birmingham in 2017 .

Jeremy Paxman at First World War graves: The BBC man says teachers rely too much on poetry to educate children about horror of the war . Teachers rely too much on poetry to educate children about the realities of the First World War, Jeremy Paxman has said. After . addressing a conference of teachers debating how to mark the centenary of . the Great War, he said that the poems of Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred . Owen 'fail to answer the really interesting questions'. Teachers . have long used poems such as Owen's Dulce et Decorum Est to teach . pupils about the suffering of soldiers in the trenches. But Paxman said . such an approach merely 'luxuriated in the horror' of the conflict. After . telling an audience that 'poetry is part of the problem of how we teach . World War One', he lamented that the war was 'only ever taught as . poetry now'. 'All that is . taught is about the pointless sacrifice,' he told The Times. 'It's not . helpful to see the whole thing through the eyes of poetry.' Such . an introduction to the war could lead to people 'passing on half-baked . prejudices', he went on, adding: 'The big question is why Owen, after . writing his anti-war poetry, and Sassoon, after his letter of protest, . decided to go back and fight.' 'Luxuriating in the horror of the thing really won't do and doesn't set out to answer the really interesting questions.' Paxman . had earlier told the conference in London, organised by Wellington . College and Wellington Academy, that a lack of a sense of duty made . another war like the First World War 'unimaginable' now. He . said he believed that modern life is all about the 'pursuit of personal . pleasure', a concept that would have been alien to young people during . the Great War. 'There was . what is notably absent now - another thing that I think makes this sort . of conflict unimaginable in the future - there was a sense of duty,' Mr . Paxman said. 'If you . consider the way we lead our lives now, we lead our lives essentially in . an atomised fashion, pursuing personal pleasure. 'It's all about personal choice; do what you want, please yourself. 'This was a world that was unknown to young people in 1914, 1915, 1916.' Poets: After addressing teachers debating how to mark the centenary of the Great War, he said that the poems of Siegfried Sassoon, left, and Wilfred Owen, right, 'fail to answer the really interesting questions' Paxman . last week said that modern society is too ‘self-obsessed’ and . ‘hedonistic’ to breed the kinds of soldiers needed for a conflict like . the First World War. Speaking . at a literature festival in Dubai, he said the idea of ‘duty’ had now . diminished in favour of ‘personal freedom’, adding: ‘What would [the . younger] generation fight for? The right to use your iPhone? What are . the great noble causes?’ He . added: ‘Ideas of duty, clearly strongly felt by many people, have . diminished as the international significance of the country has . diminished. ‘We live in such . a relativistic society now, and materialist, self-obsessed and . hedonistic; it’s hard to imagine circumstances under which people would . say that “it is worth it, I am willing to risk my life and well-being . for this.”’ Mr Paxman, 63, . said he had ‘no doubt whatsoever’ that the war would not be fought today . but that in his opinion, ‘some things are worth fighting for.’ Social media generation: Paxman also claimed recently that a conflict like the First World War would not happen today because society is too 'self-obsessed' and 'hedonistic' Wednesday's conference conference also heard from the novellist Michael . Morpurgo, the author of War Horse, who said he believed that all young . people should visit not just British war graves but German ones too to . ensure that they understand ""where we come from"". The . best-selling writer and former children's laureate also suggested that . children need to be told personal stories about historical events such . as the First World War because these are often too big for them to . comprehend. Mr Morpurgo said stories are able to get through to people in a way that history books are unable to do. He . told delegates he wanted to inspire and alert young minds to what . happened during the war because it was 'the critical moment of our . times, it was the cusp of history'. 'Over the top' during the Battle of the Somme. Paxman believes nothing like this war would ever happen again because the young men and women of today have no motivation to fight or 'ideas of duty' 'I . think it should be, I won’t say obligatory, but the minister of . education in me says obligatory, for every child to go there and stand . there and look at those graves, but not just our graves, to go to the . German graves where actually they don’t go,' he said. 'Because . they were sons and fathers just as our boys were. So I think that’s . important because we are living in this world where we travel, we are . European, we feel together with these people but it is important for us . to know where we come from.' He also said that fiction and stories can teach people about different topics. 'Of . course history has to be the basis of it, that’s absolutely the case, . but it is the case also that the records that are left behind, that is . the diaries, the letters home, those voices which speak from the heart, . from the front to those who are loved at home, or simply jotted down, or . the poems that they wrote, they have a way of getting through to us as a . history book might not be able to do.' Speaking on how to educate pupils about the war, Michael Morpurgo said stories are able to get through to in a way that history books are unable to . He . added: 'What I’ve tried to do all my writing life and all my teaching . life is to bring stories to children. And I think the critical thing . about making stories that work for children is that the children have to . somehow feel the reality of the story.' Mr . Morpurgo said that teachers can stand in front of pupils and tell them . about a major moment in history - such as the atrocity of the Holocaust. 'It’s . all huge, it’s all too massive to comprehend such suffering and anyway . for them, it was then, so whilst they might write an essay about it and . somehow you’ve told them that story, you haven’t touched them, and you . and I all know the way to touch them - they read Anne Frank. 'They go there and they know it then, and they care about it because they care about one person.' In . a written statement for the conference, organised by Wellington College . and Wellington Academy, David Cameron said that children must be taught . to understand the significance of the First World War and the debt owed . to the generation who fought in it. The . Prime Minister insisted that pupils must learn why war broke out, what . it was like for those involved and how the conflict helped to shape . modern society. And he suggested that schools should not 'shy away' from teaching pupils about the realities of the conflict. He . said that this year’s centenary will be a 'hugely important national . moment' which will bring people together to reflect on the sacrifices . made by many men and women. 'I . want to put children at the front and centre of those commemorations, . so that they too understand the significance of the conflict and the . debt we owe that generation.' The . Prime Minister said pupils need to learn why war broke out, and how . 'political alliances and rivalries' could have such an impact on the . lives of people around the world. He added: 'Visiting the sites where it took place is a sobering reminder of those realities. 'Seeing . the thousands of names that cover the memorials, the row upon row of . headstones, brings to life the scale of the sacrifice.' As . many people as possible should visit the battlefields, which is why the .

Morrisons staff are feared to be at risk from fraudsters after their bank account details were stolen and published online, it emerged today. The firm launched an investigation after information about 100,000 employees was apparently leaked by an insider and posted on the internet. The blow comes just one day after the supermarket chain announced that it made a loss of £176million and pledged to cut prices to compete with Aldi and Lidl. Leak: Payroll data on 100,000 Morrisons employees has been published online . The leak came to light when a member of the public downloaded the data onto a CD and sent it to a local newspaper. In a letter to employees, Morrisons said: 'We are extremely sorry to inform you that there has been a theft of colleagues' personal information, which was uploaded onto a website. 'As soon as we became aware of this last night we took immediate steps to ensure the data was removed from the website. It was closed down within hours of us being notified. 'The information included names, addresses and bank account details of colleagues. This affects colleagues from all levels of the organisation.' Probe: Chief executive Dalton Philips is heading the company's investigation into the leak . The company has set up a hotline and dedicated email address for staff who are worried about the possibility of their information falling into the hands of scammers. The investigation into the leak, which was apparently carried out by an insider with access to the payroll rather than a hacker, will be carried out by chief executive Dalton Philips. British banks have been warned of the possibility of hackers accessing accounts, while consultants have been brought in to advise workers how to keep themselves safe. Morrisons added in a statement: 'This data theft included bank account details. Initial investigations suggest this theft was not the result of an external penetration of our systems. 'We can confirm there has been no loss of customer data and no colleague will be left financially disadvantaged. 'We have already informed our colleagues about the theft and we are helping them take the appropriate actions to safeguard their personal data.' Employees took to social media today to vent their anger at the company - with many criticising Morrisons for announcing the news on Facebook before all staff had been personally informed. One wrote: 'A hack? So why weren't these details encrypted and what not?' Another added: 'Reading about this on Facebook does not inspire confidence, we should have been notified by phone by our HR departments first thing this morning.' The leak was revealed by the Telegraph and Argus, a newspaper based in Morrisons' home town of Bradford, after 'a concerned Morrisons shopper' sent the data to it. It is not known for how long the information was available. A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are aware of the situation and are supporting Morrisons in their investigation into these matters.' A spokesman for the Information Commissioner said: 'We have been made aware of reports that Morrisons have suffered a potential data breach, and we will be making enquiries.' Yesterday the company, which is Britain's fourth biggest supermarket, revealed that it lost £176million last year thanks to a combination of falling sales and one-off costs. Morrisons announced a programme of major price cuts in a bid to compete with increasingly popular discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl, raising the prospect of a wider price war among major supermarkets.","Company insider 'downloaded payroll details and posted them online'

A small Canada town has a very interesting rite of spring: every year thousands of male garter snakes emerge from their dens and pile onto the females in writhing 'mating balls' dozens of snakes strong. The red-sided garter snakes of Manitoba winter together in mass pits where their incredible numbers make the sites the largest gatherings of snakes on the planet. When things warm up and the snakes get moving, the first thing on their minds is to mate--and they do that en masse as well in a incredible, if stomach turning, display. Scroll down for video... Creepy! The red-sided garter snakes of Manitoba winter together in dens that can have over 10,000 individuals . Frenzied: Each year the smaller males emerge first from their dens when warmth finally comes to the Canadian plains. They wait eagerly outside the dens by the thousands for the females to come out of their hibernation . The best place to spot these mating balls is in the Narcisse Snake Dens of Manitoba, Canada, where the CBC took this stunning footage of the event. Each year, the smaller males emerge first from their caves when warmth finally comes to the Canada plains. They wait by the thousands outside the dens until slowly and just by ones and twos, the significantly larger females emerge. No time to lose: Once the females slowly start to emerge, the males pounce . Clamoring males pursue a female by the dozens . Scent of a woman: The females eventually shake the males by rolling until they fall off, but the males still try to pursue her as her sex pheromones drive them mad . Dozens of males twist and turn around each female's body in a frenzied attempt to mate. The mating balls are a tightly wound group of males with one female at the center. When she decides she's had enough, the female detaches from the males in a sort crocodilian death roll. A single red-sided garter snake den, and the ensuing sexual display, can contain up to 10,000 snakes and carpet the ground completely in slithering, shiny black scales. Where the action is: The Narcisse Sname Dens in Manitoba are one of the best places to spot the creepy crawly rite of spring each year . The red-sided garter snake only lives . in dens of 1,000s in Canada, where the cold-blooded creatures require . the warmth of the group in order to survive the winter. Anyone with a desire to see the snake dens may do so when the weather warms up in Narcisse, Manitoba, Canada. The Narcisse Snake Dens are home to tens of thousands of red-sided garters and each spring the sexual displays are hard to miss. In addition to seeing them emerge from their dens, visitors may also watch the snakes' annual return. In . the fall, as they sense the temperature dropping, the snakes regroup in . the warm dens in a display a lot like the spring emergence, but in . reverse.","The red-sided garter snakes of Narcisse, Manitoba gather by the tens of thousands in caves during winter .

While the world's major dictionaries are updated every year, the Scrabble dictionary is only updated once or twice a decade, long a source of annoyance for many keen players. The announcement has already prompted a flurry of debate as to which words deserve to be considered. Lost for words? The makers of Scrabble have invited fans of the board game to vote for the first new word to be included into its official dictionary in nine years . The last update to the Scrabble dictionary was published in 2005 and contained around 4,000 new words. They included strategically useful two-letter words 'qi', a Chinese term for circulating life energy, (11 points) and 'za', North American slang for pizza (11 points). Announcing the competition this week, Scrabble's makers Hasbro suggested new words such as 'selfie' (nine points) and 'hashtag' (14 points). But fans have been proposing . their own ideas such as 'aa', a pointy rock found in Hawaii (two . points), and 'zyme', something that causes zymotic disease (18 points). Other possible choices include . 'twerk' (12 points), the suggestive bottom-wiggling dance made famous by pop star Miley . Cyrus and YOLO, an acronym for You Only Live Once (seven . points) which was entered into the Oxford Dictionary in 2012. Twerk (12 points) a raunchy, bottom-wiggling dance made famous by U.S. pop star Miley Cyrus (pictured) will likely be among the entries . While the world's major dictionaries are updated every year, the Scrabble dictionary is only updated once or twice a decade, long a source of annoyance for many players. John Chew, co-president of the North American Scrabble Players Association , said he was delighted by the announcement. He told www.wbur.org: 'My phone has . been ringing off the hook. This is huge news within the Scrabble . community, because we’ve never done anything like this before. 'I’m . heavily involved with School Scrabble. I’m going to be helping around . the National School Scrabble Championship next month. According to UK Scrabble expert Barry Grossman . Epopoeia (12 points) - an epic poem . Psst (6 points) - a word used to capture someone's attention inconspicuously . Brrr (5 points)- used to signify being cold . Barry (10 points) - another word for a blunder . Euoi (4 points) - cry of Bacchic frenzy . Qat (12 points) - a variant spelling of the word khat, which is an evergreen shrub . Jiao (11 points) - a monetary unit in China . 'And when I see kids that are of that age range, grade 4 to 8, who are playing Scrabble, it’s like they’re talking using a different language, and I have to keep telling them, ""No, LOL is not a word, OMG is not a word.’” Hasbro has invited fans to nominate their word via the game's Facebook page before March 28. The 16 finalists will be unveiled on April 2 before they are narrowed down to one final word. The chosen word will be revealed on April 10 and will be included in the fifth edition of Merriam-Webster’s Official ScrabblePlayers Dictionary. Jonathan Berkowitz, vice president of marketing at Hasbro said: 'The Scrabble Word Showdown will let fans nominate and vote on words that are fun and relevant for today’s players. 'We are excited to see which word rises to the top and makes its way into the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary.' And Peter Sokolowski, Editor at Large at Merriam-Webster, added: 'Our language changes faster than ever today.

Izzy McCarron, nine, saved her father's life by kicking him in the chest to restart his heart after he suffered a severe allergic reaction at home . A schoolgirl saved her father's life by kicking him in the chest after he suffered a severe allergic reaction which stopped his heart. Izzy McCarron, nine, restarted father Colm's heart by stamping on his chest after he collapsed at home and stopped breathing. Izzy's mother, Debbie, immediately called 999 but Izzy knew paramedics would never arrive in time to save her father, so decided to use CPR. However she quickly discovered her arms weren't strong enough, so she stamped on her father's chest instead. Debbie then took over with some more conventional chest compressions until the ambulance arrived. Izzy, who has been given a bravery award by her school, said: 'I just kicked him really hard. My mum taught me CPR but I knew I wasn't strong enough to use hands. I was quite scared. 'The paramedics said I might as well be a doctor or a nurse. My mum said that he was going to hospital with a giant footprint on his chest.' 'She's a little star,' said Debbie. 'I was really upset but Izzy just took over. I just can't believe what she did. I really think all children should be taught first aid.' 'Izzy did CPR then the paramedics turned up. He had to have two adrenaline shots on the way to the hospital and he's now been given an EpiPen and we've got to see a specialist.' Forklift truck driver Colm, from Chapel-en-le-Frith had suffered a mystery allergic reaction on Saturday and been taken to hospital, but was sent home only for it to happen again the next day. Colm, 35, suffered a mystery allergic reaction last Saturday and went to hospital but was sent home, when it happened again the next day . Those who suffer from allergic reactions often develop anaphalaxis, a severe and rapid onset of symptoms which often involves itchy skin, swelling of the face or difficultly breathing. In very acute cases the sufferer can stop breathing as their airway swell, their blood pressure can drop suddenly, and their heart can beat irregularly or even stop altogether, as in Colm's case. He has now made a full recovery from his ordeal.","Colm McCarron, 35, collapsed at home from an allergic reaction .

A federal judge Wednesday dismissed charges against an Indian diplomat whose New York arrest and strip search spurred an international scandal. A ruling filed today said Devyani Khobragade, India's former deputy consul-general, had diplomatic immunity when she was indicted on charges of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her housekeeper and lying about the maid's pay January 9. But the ruling leaves open the possibility prosecutors could bring a new indictment against her. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan hasn't commented on its plans. Scroll down for video . Cleared: A federal judge dismissed charges against Devyani Khobragade, 39, saying she had diplomatic immunity when she was indicted on charges of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her housekeeper . Khobragade's attorney, Daniel Arshack, said she feels the rule of law prevailed. ‘The law requires that any prosecution brought against an individual with diplomatic immunity must be dismissed, Arshack said. After . being indicted, she complied with a Department of State order to leave . the U.S. in January. The Indian government then asked Washington to . withdraw a diplomat from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The U.S. complied. Prosecutors accused Khobragade of making Sangeeta Richard, her housekeeper and nanny, work 100-hour weeks at a salary of just over $1 an hour, far below the legal minimum U.S. wage of $7.25 an hour. They argued that the indictment should stand because Khobragade did not have diplomatic immunity either when she was arrested, or now given that she has left the country. New life: Khobragade's attorney said the mother of two is now working for India's foreign affairs ministry in Delhi . U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said, however, Khobragade had that immunity on January 9 when the indictment was issued, having the day before been named a counselor to India's mission to the United Nations. ‘Even if Khobragade had no immunity at the time of her arrest and has none now, her acquisition of immunity during the pendency of proceedings mandates dismissal.’ she wrote. ‘The government may not proceed on an indictment obtained when Khobragade was immune from the jurisdiction of the court.’ She also lifted Khobragade's bail and said open arrest warrants based on the indictment must be thrown out. Khobragade is now working for India's foreign affairs ministry in Delhi, said her U.S. lawyer.Federal prosecutors have not said whether they will seek a new indictment. Back home: Devyani Khobragade is pictured with her father, left, as she arrives back in Delhi in January . ‘As the court indicated in its . decision, and as Devyani Khobragade has conceded, there is currently no . bar to a new indictment against her for her alleged criminal conduct, . and we intend to proceed accordingly,’ said James Margolin, a spokesman . for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. In . January, Khobragade, 39, told an Indian newspaper about her ‘immense . stress’ at leaving behind her daughters - aged seven and four - in New . York along with her husband, who is a U.S. citizen and works as an . academic. ‘I wonder if I will be able to ever reunite with my family, my husband, my little kids. I miss them,’ she told The Sunday Express at the time. Khobragade was charged by a federal grand jury in Manhattan earlier this year with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered an outcry in India. She was accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper. The indictment said Khobragade had made multiple false representations to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a personal domestic worker. Khobragade, 39, was accused of exploiting her . Indian-born housekeeper and nanny by paying her well under the U.S. minimum wage . Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper . Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying . that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat . Devyani Khobragade . She planned to bring the worker to the . United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General . of India in New York, according to the indictment. Khobragade, . 39, India's deputy consul general in New York, has maintained her . innocence to accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 . per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage. Her . arrest sparked outrage in India after revelations that she . was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants . before being released on $250,000 bail. In . a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an . arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic . immunity status to leave the United States.

The president of France is to try to turn around his abysmal approval ratings by hiring an expert in gangsta rap music to write his speeches. Francois Hollande has appointed Pierre-Yves Bocquet to help him spice up his speeches, which are widely considered to be boring. A graduate of France's top school for civil servants, Mr Bocquet is well qualified for the role. But it has emerged that he also leads a secret life as a rap music critic under the pseudonym Pierre Evil. Rapper's delight: French president Francois . Hollande has hired a gangsta rap journalist (and senior government . technocrat) as his new speech writer. Right, Pierre Evil's 2005 book Gangsta-Rap . Formerly a social security project . manager in Mr Hollande's administration, Mr Bocquet is known among . colleagues as a 'meticulous and methodical' technocrat. But . his fondness for thick, shiny rings nonetheless confused colleagues at . the Elysée who knew nothing of his doubl life as a hip hop music critic. The . mystery was resolved with the disclosure that he was the author of a . 2005 book called Gangsta Rap and a specialist reviewer for Chronic'art, a . cultural online magazine. Even . his editors at Chronic'art did not realise his true identity and his . double life has led to comparisons with the counter-cultural street . artist Banksy. Mr Bocquet, . 40, studied at Strasbourg's École Nationale d'Administration, an elite . college that trains France's top civil servants, with alumni including . past presidents Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac - as well as . Mr Hollande himself. He has . been working with the French government since the Nineties, while at . the same time developing a cultural theory of rap music as a political . weapon against America's black underclass . French music journalist Fred Hanak said he regards Pierre Evil as one of the top three rap music reviewers in the country. But, says Mr Hanak, although Evil is an authority on such figures as Public Enemy and Snoop Dogg, he is totally uninterested in France's own vibrant hip hop music scence. 'He is a little like the Jacques Chirac of rap critics: old school, excellent in foreign politics but terrible in internal affairs,' the journalist told Le Monde. Rap legend Tupac Shakur, left, appears on the cover of Mr Bocquet's 2005 book Gangsta Rap, written under the pseudonym Pierre Evil. The writer is a fan of rappers such as Snoop, right, but less interested in French rap . Mr Bocquet's promotion comes as Hollande shakes up his PR team in an effort to raise his abysmal popularity ratings amid record unemployment and a stagnating economy. He was appointed the president's chief speechwriter after Paul Bernard resigned citing 'personal reasons'. Mr Bocquet would not commment on his journalist alter-ego, except to say that his new work 'puts in parentheses his writing activities in private.' He added: 'The only person who writes speeches for François Hollande is François Hollande, my role is just to help him prepare.'","French president appoints Pierre-Yves Bocquet as chief speechwriter .

Boris Johnson is at war with Michael Gove after the Education Secretary privately backed George Osborne as  the next Tory leader, it is claimed today. The Mayor of London’s supporters are ‘obsessing’ about who will succeed David Cameron and have launched a ‘whispering campaign’ against Mr Gove, according to The Spectator magazine. There is said to have been a ‘furious eruption’ from Mr Johnson’s camp after it heard reports that the Education Secretary told newspaper proprietor Rupert Murdoch over dinner that he would prefer Mr Osborne to take over when Mr Cameron steps down. Face of fury: There is said to have been a 'furious eruption' from Boris Johnson's camp following Gove's supposed backing of Osborne for leader . The Chancellor’s supporters in Westminster believe his chances of becoming Conservative leader - largely written off a year ago - are increasing as the economy recovers and his reputation is enhanced. Mr Gove has repeatedly insisted that he will not stand for the job and is said to have ‘hitched his star’ to that of Mr Osborne. Mr Cameron is said to have decided that the Education Secretary should be deployed to ‘keep Boris in his box’. One minister familiar with the strategy said: ‘Michael is licensed to sink his teeth into Boris’ ankles in a way that neither the boss nor George can.’ Mr Gove is said to have taken to his role as ‘licensed bear-baiter’ with ‘gusto’. Bosom buddies: Education Secretary Michael Gove (left) allegedly spoke in favour of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne (right) as the next Tory leader . He and Mr Johnson had clashed over education policy, with the Education Secretary refusing to agree to the Mayor’s demands for more power over London schools. ‘There have been some genuine tensions over education. But it doesn’t account for all this madness,’ one friend said. Another supporter of the Education Secretary said: ‘If Boris’s lot think Michael is sitting in the Department for Education with maps on the walls, working out how to stop Boris, they’re mad.’ One Tory minister, who has regular dealings with the Mayor, said the row ‘reveals that Boris doesn’t have enough to do’. The Mayor is also said to have been spending time courting Tory donors, arguing that he is the only politician who can successfully defend them from wealth taxes. Big battle: It supposedly stands between George Osborne and Boris Johnson in the next leader's election for the Conservative Party . It emerged earlier this month that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne are trying to persuade Mr Johnson to stand as an MP in 2015 so that he is fully bound in to the election result. The Mayor’s allies insisted it was ‘bull****’ that the Chancellor had already personally delivered him a message saying that he should attempt to return to the Commons next year. It has been widely assumed that Downing Street would be against a 2015 Commons comeback, since it would suggest Mr Johnson wanted to be in place to challenge for the leadership because he expects Mr Cameron to lose the election and be ousted as party leader. But a close ally of the Prime Minister told the Mail that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne were ‘telling Boris to stand’ and ‘own this campaign as much as anyone else’. There has even been speculation that Mr Johnson could be offered a formal campaign role, even the party chairmanship - an offer that would be difficult to turn down. Mr Johnson’s supporters saw the intervention as an attempt to call his bluff and prepare the ground in case he does decide to stage an early return to the Commons.","Michael Gove allegedly told Rupert Murdoch that he prefers Osborne .

Bad aim: Michael Jones (left) reportedly told an inmate that he and his friends tried to shoot several people the day they killed Lane but 'kept missing' Trial: Chancey Luna (left) and Michael Jones were in court Wednesday for a hearing before their murder trial for allegedly shooting Chris Lane . Mom: Sheryl Roberts, the mother of murder suspect Michael Jones, attended her son's hearing on Wednesday . Support: Jennifer Luna, the mother of murder suspect Chancey Luna, attended the hearing wearing a shirt supporting her son . Victim: Australian national Christopher Lane was senselessly gunned down while jogging in Oklahoma last year . The . other inmate, according to George, asked Jones: 'Why did you have to . shoot an Australian? Why didnâ€™t you drive and shoot somebody else?' George said Jones had replied: 'We tried to shoot several other people, but we kept missing.' At . the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, Judge Jerry Herberger . ordered 18-year-old Jones and the 16-year-old alleged shooter, Chancey . Luna, to stand trial for the first-degree murder of Chris Lane. The . third murder accused, James Edwards, who was 15 on 16 August last year . when Lane was shot in the back and left to die on the side of a Duncan, . Oklahoma, street, has become a prosecution witness. He is hoping to have . his murder charge reduced to an accessory count. Dad: Gene Jones, Michael Jones' father, also attended Wednesday's hearing in Duncan, Oklahoma . 'Thugs': James Edwards (left), Michael Jones (center) and Chancey Luna (right) face first degree murder charges for the shooting of Christopher Lane . Questionable: Friends claimed Edwards (center) and Luna (right) were trying to join the local chapter . of the notorious Crips gang, and they posted pictures to their Facebook . where they are holding gang signs . Edwards . told the preliminary hearing Luna had fired the .22 revolver that . struck Lane as the Australian jogged, but only after the Ford Focus . driven by Jones swerved unexpectedly. Luna had later said he thought the . gun was loaded with blanks, Edwards said. In . another twist, Howard and Jim Berry, the two lawyers representing Luna, . were charged with contempt of court on Wednesday after talking to . reporters about the case last month. Remembered: Bob Gregg, a professor in the religion department at Oklahoma Christian University, bows his head as he leads the audience in prayer during the memorial service for Lane after he was shot . Support: Friends Jordan Corn, left, and Sam Moon embrace before the memorial service for Lane . Struggle: Tyler Iago is comforted by his friend, Sam Moon, of Australia as he weeps at the end of the service . A . gag order has been placed on the lawyers and prosecutors involved in . the case. The Berrys, who are cousins, entered not guilty pleas. Shortly . after the shooting, police said Jones told investigators that the three . were 'bored' and decided to kill someone for the 'fun of it'. It was later suspected that Lane's murder was race related. One . of Edwards' friends, Serenity Jackson, told The Associated Press she . didn't believe race was a factor in the shooting. She noted that Luna's . mother, Edwards' girlfriend and Jones are white. 'It has nothing to do with Chris being white. They didn't even know who he was,' said Jackson, 17, who grew up with Edwards. Tough guy: Edwards posted videos of him tossing around guns and looking threatening in a blue bandana associated with the notorious Crips gang . Victim: Chris Lane (left) was shot when he was jogging during a visit to his girlfriend Sarah Harper's (right) family home in Duncan, Oklahoma . It had previously emerged that Edwards . had posted on his Twitter profile that he 'hated white people' and . boasted that . he beat up five white people - using the derogatory term 'woods' - . after the George Zimmerman acquittal in the Trayvon Martin case. 'Ayeee I knocced out 5 woods since Zimmerman court!:) lol sh*t ima keep sleepin sh*t! #ayeeee,' he wrote. In another, he said: '90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM'. But Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said that . rather than being part of any gang, which had been suggested before, . authorities believe the boys were just wannabes who were emulating the . thuggish beliefs of their idols, with rapper Chief Keef being prime suspect. Shock: Residents of Duncan have been convulsed by the murder that has attracted worldwide attention . It emerged that the day before . Edwards is alleged to have shot dead Christopher in a drive-by from . a black Ford Focus, he tweeted about rapper Chief Keef. Two . days earlier he posted a chilling tweet that was a lyric from the . rapper's song I Don't Like. It read: 'With my n****s when it's time to . start taken life's' (sic). Other lyrics in the same song include 'pistol . toting and I'm shooting on sight'. Ford said: 'These boys were more into . some rapper that goes around, his music is violent. More than gang . stuff. One of the parents said something about rap. 'These . boys have no respect for life or authority or society, it doesn't . matter who it is. By one of their own words, they saw him go by, and . they said, ""there's the target"" and they followed him and shot him. He . could have been anybody walking down the street.' The small town has been rocked by the . senseless murder that has sent shockwaves around the world, leaving many . wondering what drove the 'bored' boys to apparently kill just for the . thrill of it. Because . of Lane's nationality, the case has gained national attention, but some . have criticized the White House for not reacting strongly enough. A . State Department spokeswoman put out a statement last year saying that . the federal government is 'deeply saddened' by Lane's death but she did . not comment on any specific action.

The mysterious woman branded the 'vamp in the veil' has spoken out about her High Court battle 'hell' The so-called ‘Vamp in a veil’, accused of scamming a pair of property developers out of luxury flats worth £14million, could now face deportation for giving  immigration officials a  false identity. Sara Al Amoudi, who is also accused of posing as a Saudi royal and has variously claimed to be 31 and 43, has lived in Britain for more than ten years after she was granted refugee status. According to her ‘victims’ Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton, Miss Al Amoudi was a penniless Ethiopian prostitute who posed as a Saudi princess to swindle them out of a property empire. High Court judge Sarah Asplin recently ruled Miss Al Amoudi could keep the flats, saying her true identity was irrelevant to the case. But remarkably, the judge admitted: ‘The exact identity of Ms Al Amoudi remains unknown.’ Buried in her lengthy judgement, however, was the revelation that Miss Al Amoudi was an asylum seeker who was granted refugee status by the Home Office. And in a twist that will embarrass immigration judges, Judge Asplin ruled: ‘Had it been necessary, I would have found that Ms Al Amoudi’s father is not the person stated in the documents produced for the Home Office.’ Her refugee status has to be periodically reviewed, and she has not yet been awarded a UK passport. Now she could be belatedly deported because officials may not have been told the truth about her identity. Her daughter Marni, 13, was born here however, meaning she would be able to argue the right to remain to preserve her ‘right to a family life’. Property developers Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton claimed they temporarily signed six flats in Knightsbridge over to Miss Al-Amoudi, but that no payment was forthcoming . Above, from left: Maha Al-Mutawakel-Ramsden, a less-modestly dressed Sara Al-Amoudi, former table dancer Diana Langer and Samera 'Amani' Al-Mutawakel, pictured at a Mayfair nightclub . Miss Al Amoudi has used her Home Office identity card to help raise a huge loan from the HSBC bank. While . in the country, she has been forced to answer allegations not only that . she was a prostitute posing as a princess for an elaborate fraud, but . also that she snorted cocaine and the horse tranquilliser ketamine on . champagne-fuelled nights out. She angrily denies being a prostitute, and claims her Muslim faith requires her to hide her face with a veil.

Dealing with Britain’s debts must not be done solely through attacks on public pending and welfare, the Lib Dems said today. In a swipe at the Tories, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said ‘there is such a thing as society’ as he warned the wealthiest must be made to pay their fair share. He also used a speech to the Lib Dem conference in York to dismiss ‘feeble’ Tory attempts to claim the income tax cut as their own policy, and signalled people who earn up to £12,500 should pay no income tax at all. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander warned the Tories against balancing the books through spending cuts alone . Mr Alexander told the Lib Dem spring conference in York that tax rises on the rich were also needed . Tory Chancellor George Osborne has said that another £25billion must be found after the election, which he wants to raise from cuts to housing benefit for young people and removing council houses from wealthy tenants. But Mr Alexander rejected the idea, insisting tax rises on the richest should also be used to balance the books. He told delegates: ‘There is still much to do in this Parliament and the next to pay down the deficit and secure the recovery. This must be done fairly. ‘And here’s where I have news for those on the right  – there is such a thing as society. ‘We cannot and will not rely only on cutting public spending and targeting welfare to finish the job. ‘That’s why we are committed to ensuring that the wealthiest pay their fair share. Mr Alexander warned the Tories 'there is such a thing as society' ‘We will find a way forward that underpins a stronger economy and delivers a fairer society.’ He warned that even with forecasts projecting the government running a surplus by 2018, ‘we will still have work to do to get our national debt burden down to safe levels’. ‘It would not be fair to leave that to our children,’ he added. ‘But we Liberal Democrats will also ensure that the state has the resources to fund the public services and infrastructure investment that our country needs. ‘And we will insist that the wealthiest make a proper contribution.’ Mr Alexander also made clear that raising the personal income tax allowance to £12,500 will be a key Liberal Democrat demand in any coalition talks after the 2015 election. In 2010 the Lib Dems promised to increase the threshold to £10,000, which it will reach in April this year. The Budget next month is expected to include a further £500 rise, which will come into effect next week, weeks before the general election. Mr Alexander said: ‘We will fight the next election with our own ideas, our own policies, our own values - no one else's. ‘And I can tell you that a top priority in any negotiation will be our aspiration to raise the personal allowance dramatically again in the next Parliament. ‘To raise it to £12,500... That would be a further tax cut for working people of £500. ‘At our first fiscal event in the next Parliament, we would deliver another tax cut of at least £100. ‘A two term Lib Dem government would then be delivering a tax cut for working people of £1200 - that's £100 a month.’ Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg applauds Mr Alexander's speech in the conference hall of the York Barbican . He claimed the rise in the tax allowance was ‘forced through’ in the face of opposition from the Tory wing of the coalition., but the Conservatives were now trying to take the credit for the policy. ‘We have had to fight for this at every Budget and at every Autumn Statement since 2010. ‘And what a fight it has been. It started in those election debates when the Conservatives said 'we cannot afford it'. ‘In 2010 the Conservatives wanted inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, we fought for and delivered tax cuts for working people. ‘In 2011 the Conservatives wanted 'shares for rights', we fought for and delivered tax cuts for working people. ‘In 2013 the Conservatives wanted a tax break for married couples that excluded millions of families, we fought for and delivered - you guessed it - more tax cuts for working people. ‘Now, belatedly, some Tories are lamely trying to claim credit. ‘Don't get me wrong, it must be hard to be a Tory in a Treasury delivering so much Lib Dem policy, so it's no surprise if some of them have gone native.’","Danny Alexander dismisses Tory plan to slash £25billion in spending .

Union bosses have spent thousands battling to reinstate two bullying nurses at the centre of the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal. Sharon Turner, 44, and Tracy White, 47, were struck off last year for ruling their wards through fear. But it has now emerged that the Royal College of Nursing spent £4,000 trying to get the decision reversed at the High Court . Bullying: Sharon Turner (left) and Tracy White (right) were struck off last year for ruling their wards through fear . The union – which claims to promote excellence in care standards – paid lawyers to argue that the damning evidence against the nurses was just ‘hearsay.’ A judge threw out the case in a one-day hearing earlier this month, ruling that it was indisputable for the pair to remain barred. The union, which is funded by nurses’ subscription fees, initially refused to say how much it spent on the case later admitted it cost £4,000. Families who lost loved ones at Mid Staffordshire are now demanding to know why an organisation that supposedly promotes excellence tried to reinstate Turner and White. Scandal: It has now emerged that the Royal College of Nursing spent £4,000 trying to get the decision reversed at the High Court. The two nurses are at the centre of the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal . Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at the trust between 2005 and 2009 and the authority is currently facing a multimillion-pound fine over a string of care blunders that led to the death of a diabetic patient. Today, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce the dissolution of Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust – which is currently in administration and which experts say has become a ‘toxic’ brand. Tracy White forged waiting times, humiliated the elderly and made vulnerable patients wait at the A&E unit. The former ward sister, 47, routinely ordered junior staff to massage data and once refused to lift a frail elderly patient. Whistleblowers said the woman, who died the next day, had been given ‘a very uncared-for and undignified last 24 hours’. Sharon Turner, by her own admission, did not ‘give a flying f***’ about patients and also helped fiddle care figures. The . 44-year-old casualty nurse branded Asian doctors ‘suicide bombers’ and . said of a male nurse that she had bullied into an attempted overdose . that he should have ‘done the job properly’. Some of the worst neglect at the Stafford hospital occurred in the A&E unit where staff admitted they became ‘immune to the sound of pain’. Turner and White were said to have ruled the casualty unit with fear, presiding over a ‘toxic’ environment by bullying young nurses to fiddle care figures. The Nursing and Midwifery Council struck the pair off in July to protect the public after what it said was among the worst cases it had seen. They are two of only four nurses to have been struck off for their involvement in the scandal. But campaigners and grieving families last night condemned the nursing union for trying to allow them to carry on working. They also accuse it of failing to stick up for whistleblowing nurses who have lost their jobs after speaking out about poor care. Jennie Fecitt, lead nurse at Patients First, a campaign group that represents whistleblowers, said: 'Although Patients First cannot directly quote on this case, it believes every nurse must have the right to representation. 'Some of our members have stated they are deeply upset and disappointed that they are not supported by unions when they have raised concerns about patient safety.' Julie Bailey, who set up campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother died at Mid Staffordshire, said: ‘Nurses are paying their subscription fees only for the RCN to use it too defend bullying and racist nurses. I think the public would be horrified to know what is going on.’ Announcement: Today, Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce the dissolution of Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust . Last year Mr Hunt implied the union was partly to blame for the Mid Staffordshire scandal because it was too preoccupied with sticking up for bullying nurses. Following a damning report, the RCN later resisted calls to split into a union and a professional body. A spokesman for the union, which has about 410,000 UK members who pay annual fees of up to £200, said: ‘In this instance, we felt it was fair and appropriate to represent the defendants in their High Court appeal due to anonymous hearsay evidence having been submitted at the NMC hearing.’ An RCN spokesperson said: 'All of our members are entitled to representation at Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearings. 'In this instance, we felt it was fair and appropriate to represent the defendants in their High Court appeal due to anonymous hearsay evidence having been submitted at the NMC hearing. 'Indeed those findings which were based on hearsay evidence were quashed by Justice Mitting, upholding an important principle of fairness.'","Sharon Turner and Tracy White struck off last year for bullying on wards .

Swetlana Maslowskaya, 32, has been jailed for two and a half years over 1 million Euro tax fraud . German tax officials continued their clampdown on high-profile tax fraudsters this week with a court in Frankfurt ordering a former Playboy playmate of the year to be jailed for two and a half years over 1 million Euro tax fraud. Swetlana Maslowskaya, 32, dressed in a black suit and striped shirt, burst into tears on Wednesday when she was told that she would spend a year in jail before any chance of release. The decision to jail Maslowskaya, who was playmate of the year in 2002, came after it was discovered that she had accepted at least $2.5 million gifts from her 90-year-old lover, the German brewery heir Bruno Schubert. This included cash sums but also cars, jewellery, exotic holidays, shopping sprees and an apartment in Salzburg which she later sold without paying tax. Maslowskaya gave up her modelling . career when she became the girlfriend of Schubert. The Playmate met the married beer tycoon in 2004, according to Bild. The model reportedly said at the time: 'He wanted to have me immediately.' Schubert, who sold the family's famous Henninger brewery in the 1980s, married Meharit Kifle, a woman of Ethiopian origin 64 years his junior in August 2009. The wedding took place five months after the death of Ingeborg, his first wife of 68 years. The multimillionaire philanthropist died aged 90 in October 2010, leading to a legal dispute among family after he changed his will and left his fortune to Ms Kifle. The family accused Ms Kifle of not taking care of the elderly tycoon properly in the lead up to this death. Maslowskaya's lawyer Eckart Hild appealed for a suspended sentence in court this week. The retired model told the court in tears: 'I am really sorry for what I did. I will never accept any gifts ever again.' Swetlana gave up her modelling career when she became the girlfriend of German brewery heir Bruno Schubert, who died four years ago when he was 90 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . PUBLISHED: . 09:03 EST, 8 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:58 EST, 8 March 2014 . The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence today demanded the Metropolitan police chief take 'decisive action' after a damning report found officers spied on her family. Baroness Lawrence has urged Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to co-operate fully with the judicial inquiry ordered by the Home Secretary following the Ellison review's 'devastating' revelations, in a letter seen by the BBC. The call comes as it emerged Stuart Lawrence, Stephen's brother, said he should take part into the probe into police handling of the case. Aspiring architect Stephen was murdered by racists at the age of 18 in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993. Decisive action: Baroness Doreen Lawrence (left) has today called for Met Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (right) to take 'the relevant and appropriate action' against those named in a damning report, which found officers spied on her family in the wake of the murder of her son Stephen in 1993 . It took nearly 20 years for two of the gang of up to six killers to be brought to justice. A report by barrister Mark Ellison QC published this week found that one of the officers on the original investigation into his death, detective sergeant John Davidson, may have acted corruptly. It was claimed that Davidson had admitted having a 'corrupt connection' with Clifford Norris, the gangland boss father of David Norris, who was finally convicted of Stephen's murder in 2012. An undercover officer also passed on personal details concerning the Lawrence family, such as comments on the separation of Stephen's mother and father Doreen and Neville, the review found. In the letter, Baroness Lawrence is said to have called on Sir Bernard to take 'the relevant and appropriate action' against individuals identified in the Ellison review. Murdered: Stephen Lawrence. The revelations were made in the Ellison review into the case . She has asked for a personal undertaking from the Met police commissioner that he and the force 'will fully co-operate with the continuing enquiries the home secretary referred to in her oral statement to the House of Commons as well as the judge-led public inquiry she has ordered', the BBC reported. The letter concluded: 'It goes without saying that the revelations in the review have been a devastating blow to Mrs Lawrence and her family. 'Any confidence that Mrs Lawrence had in your organisation has been shattered. Nothing short of immediate and decisive action by you will begin to help build the trust needed to go forward.' Her son Stuart told the BBC: 'I reserve judgement until I hear who he's tried to employ to try to do this job and I wouldn't mind being part of the team myself to ensure the job is done. 'I'm a bit sceptical and reserved about apologies if that's all they are because they are just words. 'I want to see something done,' he added. Sir Bernard said yesterday he would 'assist in any way possible' with any investigation into the claims. He plans to appoint an independent investigator to search Met archives to try to find any available evidence for the public inquiry into undercover policing. Commander Richard Walton has been temporarily removed from his job as head of the Met's counter-terrorism command SO15 following the publication of Mr Ellison's report. It revealed that an undercover officer - known as N81 - held a meeting in 1998 with Mr Walton, who was then an acting detective inspector working on Scotland Yard's Lawrence review team, responsible for making submissions to the Macpherson Inquiry. That inquiry was conducted in the late-1990s to look at the way the police had originally investigated the murder of Mr Lawrence. N81 infiltrated a group in the late 1990s, which then sought to influence the Lawrence family campaign to further its own agenda, the Ellison report revealed. The head of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), Dame Anne Owers, has apologised to the Lawrence family for the police watchdog's part in prolonging the 'family's search for the truth'. Following the report's publication on Thursday, Baroness Lawrence fought back tears in the House of Lords as she said her family had gone through '21 years of struggle'. She said she had always believed that there was corruption in the police investigation into her son's murder and was on the verge of breaking down as she made an emotional statement. The Labour peer said: 'When we embarked on the corruption case - because I knew there was always something and it was very difficult to convince other people around me, especially other police officers and even at times the Home Secretary - I believed that there was corruption at the start of Stephen's case. 'It's taken over a year for that (Mark Ellison's review) but it's taken nearly 21 years since Stephen's been killed, and the fact that we as a family had to go through all this and still there's more to come out.' She added: 'It's been 21 years of struggle and no family should have to do that.' Incredulous: Doreen and Neville Lawrence, pictured in 1998. Mr Lawrence said he 'sat down and cried' when he heard of the report's contents .","Baroness Doreen Lawrence called for 'relevant and appropriate action' against officers named in the Ellison review .

Criticism: David Loughton, chief executive of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust . The NHS boss threatening to sack a whistleblower has spent more than £6million of taxpayers’ money getting rid of staff who raised the alarm about poor care in his hospitals. David Loughton, who has earned £400,000 this year as chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust, last night faced calls to resign after details emerged of his attempts to drive out whistleblowers. It was revealed earlier this week that Mr Loughton oversaw threats to punish a whistleblower for warning that his hospital was fiddling its death rate figures. Sandra Haynes Kirkbright was suspended after claiming the hospital was manipulating records. She was sent a threatening letter saying she had breached her contract by talking to the Daily Mail – despite repeated assurances from the Government and NHS bosses that whistleblowers will be protected. Last night, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt vowed to support whistleblowers and praised the Mail.‘In light of the Daily Mail’s recent reporting it’s important to be absolutely clear that whistleblowers speaking out about poor care must be confident they will be listened to,’ he said. ‘An independent review will now establish the facts in this case. We need an open culture in the NHS where staff feel supported to raise concerns. Anything less is unacceptable.’ NHS bosses also announced there would be a ‘swift’ independent inquiry into Mr Loughton’s treatment of whistleblowers by the NHS Trust Development Authority, which monitors hospital performance. It will be conducted by human rights lawyer Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, the former president of the Law Society. The Mail can now reveal that Mr Loughton has spent millions in public money cracking down on staff who raise concerns in the public interest. He was forced to resign in shame from his previous job after his hospital was rated the worst in the country and was chastised for vilifying whistleblowers. Mr Loughton has faced intense criticism this week after his trust wrote to whistleblower Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, 50, warning that she faced the sack for raising serious concerns about the hospital to the Mail in March last year. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright only spoke out after repeatedly raising concerns with bosses that death figures were being manipulated. After talking to the Mail, she was suspended and Mr Loughton wrote to her in December warning she faced disciplinary action for blowing the whistle. Mr Hunt intervened personally in her case, demanding all action against Mrs Haynes Kirkbright be frozen. Whistleblower: Sandra Haynes Kirkbright was suspended after claiming the hospital was manipulating records . Last night, politicians and campaigners called for Mr Loughton to be sacked. Tory MP and former health minister Simon Burns spoke out against Mr Loughton in the Commons in 2002. Last night, he said: ‘It is a disgrace. It is incomprehensible that someone who was removed from their job 12 years ago because of their attitude to whistleblowers and poor performance should then, like a revolving door, end up working again in the NHS on a high salary. He should consider his position.’ As chief executive of Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry in the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, Mr Loughton openly spoke of a ‘hit list’ of five of his staff whom he was determined to get rid of. At the time, his trust was given the worst ever rating by watchdog the Commission for Health Improvement. It was found to have been overcrowding  wards. The excess death rate for non-emergency patients is said to have been 60 per cent – more than double that of Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust at the height of the hospital scandal in 2005-2008. Mr Loughton suspended two top surgeons who spoke out about high death rates. Alban Barros D’Sa, a leading surgeon, was accused of serious professional misconduct in 1999 after whistleblowing to bosses about a colleague’s worrying number of patient deaths. But Mr Loughton would not give him his job back because he had displayed a ‘lack of confidence in the chief executive’. Mr Loughton fought the case to the High Court twice and lost. After a 20-month legal battle, which cost the taxpayer £250,000, Mr Barros D’Sa, who is now 77, was cleared by an independent panel and given his job back. Heart surgeon Raj Mattu was also suspended after speaking out repeatedly to his bosses about overcrowding causing deaths at the hospital. Mr Mattu claims Mr Loughton tried to bribe him to leave quietly, but he says he rejected the offer. This claim has not yet been proven. The surgeon was suspended in February 2002 and, in the longest running case of its kind, which has cost more than £6million, he is still fighting at tribunal. By . Paul Bentley and andy dolan . David Loughton has earned £400,000 this year despite a history of failing patients and suppressing whistleblowers. Records show the chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust is paid a salary of £209,000 – more than eight times the average taken home by his staff. After turning 60 in January, he now also gets a bonus tax free lump sum of up to £195,000 from his £1.5million NHS pension. The pay package has emerged despite damning inspection reports and political anger over his performance running hospitals. Mr Loughton, who lives with wife Deborah and their two children in a £800,000 detached property outside Warwick, has worked as an NHS chief executive for 27 years. But over that time he has faced intense criticism for his ‘aggressive and bullying’ manner in covering up scandals to the detriment of patient safety. After working as a local manager, Mr Loughton was made chief executive of Coventry’s Walsgrave Hospital in the mid-80s. He ran it for 17 years, during which time he was accused in Parliament of ‘completely ruining a trust and the provision of health care in an area’. Mr Loughton was made chief executive of Coventry's Walsgrave Hospital in the mid-80s . Former watchdog the Commission for Health Improvement gave the hospital a ‘zero star rating’ in 2001. Excess death rates for non-emergency patients were worse than those seen during the Mid Staffordshire scandal and serious concerns were raised about overcrowding. The suppression of whistleblowers was also highlighted in a report, with bosses accused of creating a ‘culture of fear’ in which ‘doctors fear being victimised for voicing concerns’. Despite the criticisms, Mr Loughton’s earnings increased by more than 15 per cent to £128,000 after the report was published. Friend Gary Reay, who was chairman of the Walsgrave NHS Hospitals Trust until 2001, said Mr Loughton would get rid of anyone who crossed him, comparing him to former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. ‘Like Fergie when Jaap Stam, Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Roy Keane started getting too big for their boots, David would get rid of anybody he considered a threat, unproductive or disloyal. He had no compulsion moving them out,’ he said. ‘What I liked about him was he was very hard working and had a good sense of humour, and nobody f***** him over. He’s an in-your-face tough guy who could, if you let him, bully. ‘This woman [Mrs Haynes Kirkbright] better watch out because once he’s marked her card he’ll be after her. He’s an unforgiving b******.’ In November 2001, seven cross-party MPs called on then health secretary John Hutton to sack Mr Loughton following the damning watchdog report and accusations of bullying whistleblowers. Former North Warwickshire MP Mike O’Brien said: ‘There are a lot of excellent staff at the Walsgrave hospital who are doing a great job looking after patients, but they are handicapped by Mr Loughton’s increasingly desperate struggle to hold on to his own job.’ He added: ‘There is no confidence in Mr Loughton.’ Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for Coventry North West, said Mr Loughton was ‘impossible to reason with’ and ‘arrogant and dismissive’.","David Loughton earned £400,000 this year as chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust .

Liverpool scout Neil Richardson was among the crowd at Bramall Lane on Sunday as Sheffield United pulled off a memorable fightback to beat Nottingham Forest 3-1. Liverpool's Conor Coady, enjoying an extended loan spell at Sheffield, scored the vital 66th minute equaliser and would have earned a favourable progress report from Richardson. However, Nottingham Forest's Jamaal Lascelles and Sheffield United's Harry Maguire were also on Richardson's radar. Brave: Liverpool sent Neil Richardson to watch Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles (centre) Wanted man: Lascelles (right) is also being tracked by Everton, Tottenham, Arsenal and Newcastle . Strong man: Sheffield United's Harry Maguire (left) is also interesting Liverpool as they look for defenders . Head in hands: Maguire reflects on a key moment in Sheffield United's 3-1 FA Cup win over Nottingham Forest . Liverpool are among a growing list of clubs keen on Lascelles with Everton, Tottenham, Arsenal and Newcastle all considering whether to bid for him in the summer. The 20-year-old has long been touted as a potential England international but niggling injuries coincided with a dip in form that was until this season where he has prospered again under Billy Davies. Maguire, who has been watched by Chelsea, United and Southampton as well, is also 20 and a strong defender but may lack the quality in possession that Lascelles can show and that Liverpool are looking for. Liverpool are continuing to look at other options for the summer with a left-back, second goalkeeper, winger and striker among their target positions as well as another midfielder. Udinese striker Luis Muriel has again been watched by scouts in recent weeks but the Colombian has struggled in front of goal this season. Man United keeping tabs on Carvalho . Manchester United scouts were again present at Sporting Lisbon where the focus of attention has been on young midfielder William Carvalho. The combative 21-year-old Portugal international, who is signed to superagent Jorge Mendes, was booked during the 1-0 win over Olhanense with another starlet Carlos Mane scoring the decisive goal. Targeted: Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho (second left) has been scouted by Man United numerous times . Under watch: Sporting defender Marcos Rojo is being monitored by Manchester United's scouts . However, United have also been monitoring Sporting's left-sided defender Marcos Rojo. The 23-year-old, who is very good on the ball and plays at left-back for Argentina, was the subject of a failed bid by Fulham in the last window. United will lose Nemanja Vidic, with Inter Milan hoping to confirm his signature soon, while Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra are also expected to move on. Inter are also among clubs keen on 32-year-old Evra who has an option to stay at Old Trafford. Vietto interesting Real Madrid . Real Madrid are the latest club to ask about Luciano Vietto. A number of European clubs have expressed an interest in the 20-year-old striker from Racing Club. Vietto is looked after by Jorge Cysterpiller, the former representative of Diego Maradona, and has been likened to Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez. In demand: Racing Club's young Argentine striker Luciano Vietto is wanted by Real Madrid . Madrid are opening talks with Karim Benzema over a new contract but have big name options in mind should those talks stall while Vietto is seen as one who could develop with his asking price around £8million. Everton and Liverpool have been credited with interest but Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone who coached Vietto as a teenager is also keen. Butland edging nearer to Leeds loan . England international goalkeeper Jack Butland will discuss a potential loan move to Leeds United later on Monday. Stoke are willing to allow the 20-year-old to move with Asmir Begovic now back fit again and Thomas Sorensen a capable deputy. Leeds are looking to strengthen the core of their side and want Butland to challenge Paddy Kenny for the No 1 jersey as they kick on for promotion with a takeover from Italian Massimo Cellino pending. Experience: Stoke's Jack Butland (left) is set to go out to Championship Leeds for a spell on loan . Fingertips: Butland fails to reach a Luis Suarez shot against Liverpool in one of his rare outings for Stoke this season . Butland wasan outstanding playing on loan for Barnsley against Leeds in December when he kept a clean sheet in a 0-0 draw and manager Brian McDermott is hopeful he can persuade the 6ft 5ins keeper to make the move. Butland joined Stoke in January last year for £4million from Birmingham City. He made his England debut aged just 19, becoming the country’s youngest-ever goalkeeper, in the friendly against Italy in August 2012, having been taken to the European Championship that summer by Roy Hodgson as third-choice keeper. Manager Mark Hughes gave Butland his Premier League chance against Everton last month and he figured against Leicester, Liverpool and Crystal Palace before Begovic returned. Hughes said: 'We are fortunate here at Stoke that we have exceptionally talented keepers at varying stage of their career. I'm very confident with Jack and I know he can perform at Premier League level.' Leeds are also in the hunt for a striker with Sunderland's Connor Wickham and Hull's Matty Fryatt among those being considered on loan. Eriksson keen to take Ameobi to China . Sven Goran Eriksson is keen on Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi. The former England and Manchester City coach is now in charge at Chinese Super League side Guangzhou R&F and wants a British-style centre forward to help his side. Ameobi's team-mate Papiss Cisse has also been courted by clubs from China as well as ones from Russia with their transfer windows closing in Russia at midnight on February 27 and 24 hours later on Friday February 28 in China. On his way? Former England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Newcastle's Shola Ameobi in China . Newcastle are in enough disarray without allowing strikers to go at this stage and departures are unlikely but that won't prevent the Chinese making a lucrative offer for Ameobi, who at 32 will consider all options. The Newcastle striker could yet wait for the season's end before departing, when he will have more offers from England also. At that stage Newcastle will also expect to lose Mathieu Debuchy and Hatem Ben Arfa with Inter Milan keen on the latter. Newcastle are looking at players to replace Ben Arfa though with 21-year-old Argentine Manuel Lanzini on their scouting list. The River Plate attacking midfielder has an Italian passport and would be available for around £6million. Fletcher attracts admirers . A host of League One sides are weighing up a summer move for York City striker Wes Fletcher. The 22-year-old was at Manchester United and Liverpool as a boy before signing for Burnley. However, he was unable to make the breakthrough there and took the chance to join York where he has caught the eye with some solid performances and 13 goals. He has another year left on contract so York will be looking for around £150,000.","Liverpool track Nottingham Forest's Jamaal Lascelles and Sheffield United's Harry Maguire .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . PUBLISHED: . 18:23 EST, 9 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:05 EST, 10 March 2014 . It’s amazing how quickly things change in football. Last season Robin van Persie was Manchester United’s hero but now he looks like he’s had his nose put out of joint. I’ve seen it before with players who are the main man and all of a sudden somebody takes their place. It seems to affect strikers more often because they have a greater sense of hierarchy. Trudging off: Robin van Persie is substituted at The Hawthorns on Saturday . Contrast: Celebrating United's title win with Ferguson last season (left) and being hauled off by Moyes . Last season, it was all about Van Persie. He was Fergie’s golden boy but under Moyes it’s been a different story. United have been in poor form and so has the Dutchman. Wayne Rooney’s new contract shows how much the club value him and, little by little, you can see the confidence seeping away from Van Persie. I am not suggesting he is a bad player. He is a sensational footballer and he was No 7 in my list of the top foreigners to grace the Premier League. But, at 30, Van Persie is not getting any younger and, if he is still not happy by the summer, I wouldn’t be surprised if United decide he is surplus to requirements. Main man: Van Persie knows he is behind Wayne Rooney (centre) in the pecking order . Pushing for a start: Danny Welbeck (centre) scored in the 3-0 win at West Brom . STRAIGHT-TALKING TIM . After a result like Tottenham had at Stamford Bridge, it was refreshing to see a manager come out and talk with such honesty. When Spurs manager Tim Sherwood spoke after the game, you could see how much the performance was hurting, and how much it meant to him. It was almost as if he couldn’t help himself. He is a real football man, he speaks from the heart and he just gave his honest view of the performance. Some people don’t like that passion and you very rarely hear managers take on their players. There is a risk you might alienate the dressing room and Tim might have gone a bit far, but sometimes that’s what happens in the heat of the moment. He is no laptop manager and he calls it as he sees it. There has been talk in some quarters that if he doesn’t finish in the top four he will lose his job. That is ridiculous. Spurs might expect a top-four finish but they don’t have a divine right to be there — they’ve done it only twice in 24 years. People will say his words will damage the dressing room, but there’s no better way for the players to prove themselves than in the north London derby on Sunday. Fuming: Tim Sherwood pulled no punches after Spurs were thrashed by Chelsea . CLASSY CAULKER . Steven Caulker had a great game for Cardiff and continues to build on his impressive reputation. And when you look at some of Tottenham’s defending, you wonder why they let him go. If Spurs are in the market for a defender, Caulker is exactly the kind of person they would be going for. Chelsea re-signed Nemanja Matic after all, and stranger things have happened. Case for the defence: Caulker has had a better season than many of his former Spurs team-mates . NOT BAD, SAMUEL, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS GAZZA! It’s been a good weekend for goal celebrations. David Meyler headbutted a corner flag and I loved Samuel Eto’o’s on Saturday night. It was cheeky and a great way to respond to Jose Mourinho’s comments about his age — even Jose was laughing. Chelsea pensioner: Eto'o celebrates his goal against Tottenham on Saturday . Some people have said it was the best ever, but if Eto’o gets a 9.9 from the judges, then Paul Gascoigne and the dentist’s chair gets a perfect 10. Before that game against Scotland he told us that he would go for it if he scored. We didn’t believe him but then he scored that incredible goal and he set off. We all thought, ‘Where’s he going?’ Then he just sprawled out on the floor and we all joined in. It was a genius goal and a genius celebration. No contest: Gascoigne celebrates with (left to right) Steve McManaman, Alan Shearer and Jamie Redknapp . SOME REAL CUP MAGIC . What a result for Wigan. I knew they would give City a tough game but I did not expect that. And it was deserved. They play good football, just as they did under Roberto Martinez, and Uwe Rosler uses a system that works. Arsene Wenger will feel like he’s won the pools. Arsenal could finally end the years without a trophy, but before they get too excited they should remember losing to Birmingham in the Carling Cup final four years ago. You can’t underestimate Wigan, who join only Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Barcelona in winning at the Etihad this season. Hull boss Steve Bruce enjoyed a great result against Sunderland — one of his old clubs — and will face yet another in Sheffield United. Nigel Clough has done wonders at the Blades, taking them from 21st to 11th and winning nine on the spin. Hopefully Clough will soon have them back where they belong. Pointing the way: Ex-City striker Uwe Rosler produced another upset for Wigan . Butt of the joke: Hull midfielder David Meyler shows his sense of humour after scoring on Sunday . That way to Wembley: Nigel Clough has guided League One Sheffield United to the semi-final . FULHAM NEED A MIRACLE . Fulham has always been a club that prides itself on stability, but they have caught the Premier League madness bug. To go through three managers in three months beggars belief, because there is no magic wand. They have fewer points at this stage than all three relegated sides had last season. It’s an awfully long way back from here. In need a miracle: Fulham manager Felix Magath watched his side lose again . ENGLAND MEMO . We had a reminder on Saturday of the quality of some of England’s fringe players with good performances from Jay Rodriguez and Ross Barkley. Southampton’s Rodriguez has had a good season and though Barkley was on the losing side against Arsenal, his run to set up Everton’s goal was sensational. He is one of the few England central midfielders who can run with the ball at pace down the middle. Both would be unlucky to be left in the departure lounge rather than boarding the plane to Brazil. Knocking on the door: Everton's Ross Barkley (left) and Southampton's Jay Rodriguez (right)","Robin van Persie was Manchester United’s main man last season but has been overtaken by £300,000-a-week Wayne Rooney .

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last night demanded answers over the case of an NHS whistleblower threatened with the sack after raising concerns about death rates. The Cabinet minister intervened after the Mail revealed Sandra Haynes Kirkbright could be fired for raising fears that a hospital was fiddling its death figures. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, a 'health coder', was suspended after accusing Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust of manipulating records and hiring her in the belief she would do the same. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has intervened over the case of an NHS whistleblower threatened with the sack after raising concerns about death rates . The 50-year-old received a letter from hospital bosses last week saying she had breached her contract by talking to the Press, and warning that she faced a hearing which 'may result in formal disciplinary action, not excluding dismissal'. The threat was made despite repeated assurances from the Government and NHS bosses that whistleblowers will be protected. Last night Mr Hunt met urgently with hospital watchdogs to demand an investigation into the case. Bosses at Wolverhampton were later instructed to postpone any planned action against Mrs Haynes Kirkbright. In a letter to Mr Hunt last night, David Flory, chief executive of the NHS Trust Development Authority, wrote: 'I have today written to the chief executive of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, David Laughton, asking him to clarify what action the Trust has taken to address the whistleblowing allegations and to assure us that any further action they plan does not impede Mrs Haynes Kirkbright's rights as a whistleblower. Sandra Haynes Kirkbright (pictured) could be fired for raising fears that a hospital was fiddling its death figures . 'A disciplinary hearing for Mrs Haynes Kirkbright is due to take place in two weeks' time. I have today instructed the Trust to postpone this hearing.' Mr Flory also said that bosses at Wolverhampton could face being disciplined themselves. 'Any allegation of wrongdoing, if proven, would result in formal action being taken,' he added. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was hired by Royal Wolverhampton in October 2011. She had previously worked at Stafford Hospital and overseen an improvement in coding â€“ an administrative role of recording how patients have been treated. Bosses offered to almost double her salary to Â£54,000 a year. She now believes this is because they thought she had performed some kind of 'trick' in making death figures at the scandal-hit hospital look better than they really were. Royal Wolverhampton had scored one of the highest mortality rates in the country, with concerns raised over high deaths at weekends. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright said the hospital was as bad or worse than Stafford, where as many as 1,200 patients died needlessly. Immediately after starting her new job, Mrs Haynes Kirkbright raised concerns with her bosses that its coders were 'breaking every rule in the book'. Bosses reacted angrily to her claims, with one instructing her not to put them in writing because 'the Press can get hold of it through Freedom of Information'. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was suspended for alleged bullying and harassment nine months after starting work for Wolverhampton. She denies the claims and, believing they had been made up to silence her, she spoke to the Mail in March last year. Last night, Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, who is originally from Texas, said she was delighted her case was being examined by watchdogs. 'I feel relieved,' she added. 'It is extremely encouraging that Jeremy Hunt is standing by what he has said about protecting whistleblowers.'

'Now I rely on products like Scholl Express Pedi to help me . get my feet back to being touchable soft and smooth.

She goes on to explain how she has been keeping in shape now that she's not dancing around on stage on Strictly Come Dancing. 'I . see my trainer 3 times a week and she works me really hard.

Kimberley's latest job sees her smouldering for the Ready to Glow campaign. A recent study by Ready to Glow found . that the average woman will spend more than £13,000 during her lifetime . on looking and feeling good. Researchers found the 'cost of . confidence' carries a hefty price tag, as women fork out £205.68 a year - . or £13,369.20 in their lifetime - on beauty products in order to feel . better about themselves. Around 86 per cent of women claim their confidence is greatly improved if they are well groomed from top to toe. And six in ten women have a strict beauty regime in place to ensure they leave the house feeling assured about their appearance. But the study also found that despite . the costly outlay, women only feel good about themselves for three . hours and 43 minutes a day. Speaking about her role, which aims to empower women to look and feel great by carrying out everyday beauty basics to achieve that radiant ‘glow', she said: 'I am proud to be part of Ready to Glow, like many woman I’ve had my own body hang-ups in the past but I’m passionate about helping or supporting other women to feel confident in their own skin and celebrating natural beauty.' But the talented star always has her eyes firmly set on the future. Speaking about her big plans, she said: 'I'm someone that loves to keep busy, and always love to have things in my diary!

Moyes wrote in his letter, titled A Word From The Boss: ‘While I knew that this job would be a challenge when I took it on, the difficult season we have experienced was not something that I envisaged, which I am sure is the case as well for you supporters – and my players, staff and I am desperate to compensate for that.’ ‘Everywhere we turn people outside the club have a lot to say about Manchester United, but we have all stuck together through some tough times this season and I firmly believe that, in the long run, we will all come out at the other end, stronger for the experiences. ‘Everything we need have been through will make us a better, stronger team and club in the future.‘Over the years you have seen great winning sides here and, in time, I have absolutely no doubt that we will see great winning sides here again. ‘A big step towards that will be transforming Old Trafford back into the fortress it has long been renowned as, and we will do everything in our power to get the positive performances and results to do that, so that we can give you Season Ticket holders and all of our supporters something to shout about.’ To repay the fans, Moyes has promised improvement next season, and wants Old Trafford to become a fortress once again, like it was under Ferguson. 52594 . 36950 . 84359 . 201039 . 55125 . 32857 .

This month saw the launch of the eighth easyGym, its flagship branch in a space formerly occupied by a Virgin Active in London’s Oxford Street. But while Virgin membership cost £70 a month, easyGym is just £19.99 (in the new London branch — the others cost from £15.99 a month), with no joining fee or contract. Sounds too good to be true? If easyGyms are anything like easyJets, I expect them to be sweaty, cramped and full of hidden costs. Claire Coleman puts easyGym's latest offering to the test and aside from the orange colour scheme and prison-style changing rooms, she is more than impressed . Indeed, the price you see isn’t necessarily the price you pay. Fancy doing classes? It’ll cost you an extra £11.99 a month. Want to watch TV on the treadmill? That’s another £1.99 per month. Inside, it’s orange and functional. I hadn’t expected piles of fluffy towels, but it seems privacy comes at a premium, too. While it sounds good value, it'll cost you an extra £11.99 a month to do classes and £1.99 per month for TV on the treadmill . Claire was amazed by the exercise machines, saying they had the most sophisticated entertainment system she'd ever seen in a gym . The changing rooms are communal with the barest of facilities — like a prison. With just ten showers and about 300 lockers, I’d expect queues. But then I step onto the gym floor and my jaw drops. I’d assumed they’d have kept all the old Virgin stuff and painted the place orange but there’s more than 14,500 sq ft of space, packed with new high-quality machinery and fitness gear. The main machines feature the most sophisticated entertainment system I’ve ever seen in a gym. Not only can you choose from more than 70 TV channels, but you can surf the web and plug in your iPod to watch your own films.

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 03:38 EST, 3 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:59 EST, 3 August 2013 . Misconception: James Taylor's new book claims that the 'Your Country Needs You' image featuring Lord kitchener was never actually used on recruitment posters . It's the iconic poster that is said to have been the call to arms that millions of young men to sign up for the Army in World War One. But an art expert turned historian has cast doubt over the authenticity of Lord Kitchener's famous 'Your Country Needs You' as a recruitment poster. In a new book James Taylor, who has researched the history of recruitment posters, has claimed that the public perception that the image of Kitchener pointing a finger encouraged swathes of men to go off and fight in the trenches is a misconception. In the book, entitled Your Country Needs You, he says that his research shows that the image was never used for official recruitment purposes and not widely produced as a poster. Mr Taylor, a former Victorian paintings specialist at a London auctioneers, studied records of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee which produced war time posters in the National Archives at Kew. Despite the records showing nearly 200 official recruitment posters used during the First World War, the Kitchener poster is absent from the archives. He also looked at several thousand images of street scenes and recruitment offices taken during the war and found no trace of the poster. He says that the image was first used on the cover of London Opinion magazine and designed by graphic artist Alfred Leete. The magazine then offered its readers the opportunity to buy postcards of the image for 1s 4d for 100 - but Mr Taylor has been unable to track down any surviving postcards. The image was catalogued by mistake in the Imperial War Museum's poster collection when it acquired the artwork in 1917 leading to the public's misconception over its use. Even the wording associated with the image has changed over the decades. The original design featured an image of Kitchener and the words 'wants you' underneath followed by 'join your country's army! God save the King'. Icon: Lord Horatio Kitchener, pictured during the First World War, was appointed secretary of state for war in 1914 . But the words have changed to 'Your country needs you' in later reproductions. He told the Daily telegraph: 'The image's influence now is absolutely out of all kilter with the reality of its initial impact. 'It has taken on a new kind of life. It is such a good image and, saying that, it was later seized upon.' Born in Ireland in June 1850, Lord Horatio Kitchener was secretary of state for war in the first years on World War One. He joined the Royal Engineers at the age of 21 and was appointed governor general of eastern Sudan in 1886. He became commander in chief of the Egyptian army in 1892 and was eventually made governor of Sudan. In 1900, Kitchener was appointed as chief of staff to Lord Roberts, British commander in the Boer War. At war: The image had been credited with helping to recruit millions of young men to fight in the trenches . Roberts returned to England and Kitchener was left to cope with much Boer resistence. His means of dealing with the resistance were much criticised - they included the use of camps to imprison civilians, the origin of the term 'concentration camp' which is more associated with Nazi Germany. Despite the controversy, he was made a Viscount on his return to England in 1902 and became commander in chief in India then proconsul of Egypt. He was made secretary of state for war when fighting broke out in 1914 and set up recruiting huge numbers of volunteers to be trained as part of a succession of new 'Kitchener armies'. He was gradually stripped of his responsibilities by the government and he drowned in June 1916 when his ship HMS Hampshire was sunk by a German mine off the Orkney islands.","James Taylor's new book says the image was never used as a recruitment poster .

Chris Gayle bemoaned the England demise of his absent friend as he called the ECB’s decision to sack Kevin Pietersen ‘disrespectful.’ West Indies’ great entertainer returns from injury for the first of three Twenty20 internationals on Sunday at the Kensington Oval in Barbados disappointed that the player of the tournament when England won the short-form World Cup four years ago will not be back in Bridgetown now. ‘I’m disappointed by the manner he had to bow out of international cricket,’ said Gayle, a close friend of Pietersen and a key figure in West Indies own World Twenty20 triumph in Sri Lanka two years ago. ‘It’s disrespectful, the way he had to go. He’ll definitely be missed by spectators, so I will try to put on a display. It's in his hands now: Chris Gayle says he'll have to 'put on a show' in Kevin Pietersen's absence . Lack of respect: Gayle disagrees with England's decision to axe his friend Pietersen (right) Old pals' act: Gayle and Pietersen show their mutual admiration for each other in 2009 . ‘I don’t know what happened behind closed doors but for such a big player who has made such an impact around the world to go out like that was sad. 'You want to give a great player the chance to retire and walk away from the game regardless of what has happened. 'We have swapped a few texts since the decision was made and he will be OK, I'm sure. he has a lot of business to do. I actually think he will be playing on Sunday! He will be replacing Joe Root!’ That will not happen, with England’s resolve as strong as ever to move on without Pietersen, believing their decision to sack him a ‘no brainer’ after constant bad behaviour in Australia while being on a final warning. Indeed, they have several pages of cumulated evidence on why he had to go. Gayle force: The West Indies opener has returned after missing the ODI series, which England won . Short-term pain, long-term gain: England will miss Pietersen in the World Twenty20 this month but they maintain the decision to sack him was the right one . Winner: Player of the tournament Pietersen celebrates wildly with the World T20 trophy in 2010 . There is no question that England’s hopes both in this three-match series and in the World Twenty20 that follows in Bangladesh will be lesser without Pietersen but they believe the short-term pain will be worth the long-term gain. One England player who is very much here and delighted to be so is home-town boy Chris Jordan, who will be watched by a large number of family and friends on his return to his native Barbados with his adopted country. Jordan has long since thrown in his lot with England having been spotted here by former England batsman Bill Athey and offered a scholarship at Dulwich College and he insists there will be no conflicting emotions if, as expected, he returns to the England team on Sunday having missed the last two games. ‘It’s a very nice feeling to be back,’ said Jordan, who is trying to claim the whole of England’s allocation of . tickets for Sunday's match. ‘I will be very proud to wear an England . shirt in Barbados. ‘I don’t know how the home spectators will react to . me but my family and friends are behind me a hundred per cent and that’s . what matters to me. I’m more than happy with my decision.’ Home boy: Chris Jordan is back on Barbados, the Caribbean island on which he was born and raised . Just the ticket: Jordan joked that he was trying to claim the full allocation for Sunday's match . In an ideal world Jordan should be playing for West Indies but, to be fair to him, he has said that he wanted to play for England from the moment he started making an impact at Surrey as a teenager and served a qualification period, even playing for Barbados in English winters as an overseas player. He insists no serious approach has ever been made to him to play for West Indies. Serious back injuries and a loss of form prompted a move to Sussex where he finally fulfilled his huge potential and he has made a good impression in the handful of one-day appearances he has so far made against Australia and now West Indies. He will play on Sunday if England leave out one of the spinners who served them so well in Antigua on what is expected to be a much better Barbados pitch than the one seen at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium for a one-day series that England won 2-1.

Glenn Cosby, the last male in Great British Bake Off, has been voted off the show, sparking accusations that the show favours women . Some say the days when women ruled the roost in the kitchen have been consigned to the past. But they have clearly not been paying attention to this year’s Great British Bake Off. The hit baking show has been accused of favouritism towards its female contestants after the last man was eliminated from the series with three episodes still remaining. A string of male viewers – including celebrity chef Nigel Slater and two former competitors – complained after teacher Glenn Cosby, 37, was voted off this week’s show, leaving five women to compete in next week’s quarter final. One - last year’s runner up James Morton - said his faith in the show was ‘completely lost’ and threatened to start watching Channel 4 show Grand Designs instead. He added: ‘Should be renamed ‘Great British Bloke Off’. Tuesday’s episode was watched by 6.3million viewers, a series record and the second highest audience in the BBC2 show’s history. But its 1.9million male fans saw the last remaining male baker struggle with his puff pastry and watch in dismay when his showstopper mille-feuille collapsed in a sticky mess. Mr Crosby was the fourth man to be voted off in a row, prompting dismay among male viewers. Writing on Twitter, Mr Morton said: 'First Howard. Now Glenn. Faith in #GBBO completely lost. Next week, I’m watching Grand Designs. 'Last man standing in #GBBO is sent packing. An all-women show from now on. Should be re-named “Great British Bloke Off”.’ Celebrity chef Nigel Slater was equally disappointed, saying: ‘I SO didn’t want that to happen. #GBBO so disappointing such a lovely man!’ And the winner of the first Bake Off series, Edd Kimber, also showed his allegiances were with the last remaining man, saying: ‘Oh no @GlennCosby so sorry to see you go, you’ve been absolutely fabulous! #gbbo.’ The episode was watched by 6.3million viewers, a series record and the second highest audience in the BBC2 show¿s history . The Bake Off crown will now be contested by Beca Lyne-Pirkis, Christine Wallace, Frances Quinn, Kimberley Wilson and Ruby Tandoh. Some suspicious viewers suggested they owed their success to favouritism from judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood rather than their own merits. Last week, some noticed ‘sexual tension’ between 47-year-old Hollywood – who split from his wife in May – and 21-year-old Miss Tandoh. Now viewers complained the attractive philosophy student, who is a former model, was treated differently to the others. One Tweeted: ‘Ruby gets way to much favouritism from Paul and Mary.’ Another added: ‘I hope Paul Hollywood doesn’t do his usual flirtatious favouritism with Ruby again this week, it’s getting tiresome.’ A third said: ‘I am actually considering stopping watching #GBBO I have never seen anything so blatantly fixed in one person’s favour.’ Two of the three Bake Off series so far have been won by men, with last year’s final an all-male affair. But many male viewers said this year’s series showed the traditional sexual roles have been re-established. One said: ‘This program proves that men are crap cooks & a woman’s place is well & truly in the kitchen. Birds 5 Blokes 0. #GBBO #TakeCover.’ A female fan replied: ‘Women ARE the best bakers! #GBBO.’","Glenn Cosby was fourth man to be voted off in a row .

But had he become president, he said, the NSA would be a shell of its current self . Former presidential candidate and retired long-time Texas Republican Congressman Ron Paul told MailOnline on Monday that if he had won the GOP nomination in 2012 and ultimately claimed the White House, the National Security Agency would no longer be in the dragnet business. 'I would have said that we have to continue to have some surveillance,' Paul said during an exclusive interview, 'but only under the legitimate authority of the Constitution.' He criticized the Obama administration and his former congressional colleagues for executing what he called an 'end run' around the Constitution, leveraging the controversial PATRIOT Act to do it, and then keeping the result secret from the American people. 'We want them to ask why the terrorists want to hurt us, right?' he began. 'And then when they ask, they don't like the answer they get. So they lie about it.' 'And then we expect them to be truthful about how we can solve the problem while taking the Constitution seriously? Why are we surprised when the government hides the ball?' Paul said that if he were president, he would not 'ask for things in a FISA court,' and would 'only conduct searches when you have probable cause that there's a crime.' Asked about the NSA's wholesale scraping of data from mobile phone providers and online companies like Google and Facebook, the former congressman spoke in absolutes, even when presented with an imaginary scenario in which National Security Adviser Tom Donilon briefed him on the PRISM project on the morning after his successful presidential election. 'If I were president I would have declared that there would have been no probable cause.' he declared. 'So, no. It wouldn't have happened.' Bittersweet vindication? Ron Paul has been warning for a decade about the rise of the perfect security state, and now he sees his worst fears realized . Chairman and Vice Chairman of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (L) and Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R) are on the defensive, which is where Ron Paul says they should be, having empowered the executive branch with too much power . Paul said even the construction of the NSA's mega-complex in Utah, where the agency is reportedly preparing the world's largest data storage facility, would have come to a halt. 'If it's wrong, why continue to spend more money on something that's wrong, and doesn't solve our problem? I would have stopped it right away,' he said. The libertarian firebrand claimed he wasn't surprised to learn how far the federal government has gone to surveil Americans with a public-safety justification. 'This is the very sort of thing I've been talking about for years,' he said, sounding more sad than angry. Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency, outed himself this weekend as the source for The Guardian's reports on U.S. intelligence programs . He also found it unsurprising that Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked information to The Guardian newspaper in London, contributed a total of $500 to his campaign in 2012. Reason magazine first reported those donations. 'I would think anyone who's interested in the government telling the truth would have been paying attention to what I was talking about' on the campaign trail, he said. 'But I'm not sure why it matters that he supported my campaign.' And what messages might Snowden have found appealing? 'Congress is derelict in giving that much power to the government,' Paul said. 'This is a natural consequence of growing government. The more power they have, the less they want to tell us about. And, you know, they had the legal authority to do this.' Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin complained over the weekend that the NSA was overstepping the bounds described by the PATRIOT Act, of which he was the principal author . Ron Paul (R) got short shrift from major media outlets in 2012 despite staying in the presidential race longer than other Republican candidates including former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum (L) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (2nd L). He was the only candidate other than Mitt Romney (2nd R) to enter the GOP convention with pledged delegates . Asked about Wisconsin Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner's insistence that the PATRIOT Act, which he drafted, doesn't justify the NSA's widespread general surveillance program, Paul scoffed. 'It's not coming from a deeply principled viewpoint, but I'm glad he's saying it. It adds credibility to our argument,' he said. 'Better late than never.'","Edward Snowden, the NSA leaker, gave $500 to Paul's 2012 campaign .

'Mr. Wagner has fully cooperated over the last 30 years in the investigation of the accidental drowning of his wife in 1981,' Berk said in a prepared statement. 'Mr. Wagner has been interviewed on multiple occasions by the Los Angeles sheriff's department and answered every single question asked of him by detectives during those interviews.' Fatal: This is the yacht Splendor that Ms Wood and Mr Wagner were aboard when the actress went overboard and drowned off Santa Catalina Island over Thanksgiving weekend in 1981 . Dangerous: Ms Wood reportedly could not swim. Her body was found floating in the water near Catalina Island hours after she went overboard . After 30 years, Berk said, neither . Mr Wagner nor his daughters have any new information to add. She said the . latest investigation was prompted by people seeking to exploit and . sensationalize the 30th anniversary of the death. The renewed inquiry came after the yacht's captain Dennis Davern told '48 Hours' and the 'Today' show that he heard Mr Wagner and Ms Wood arguing the night of her disappearance and believed Mr Wagner was to blame for her death. The authorities have not identified any suspects in the case. Confession: Dennis Davern, the skipper of the yacht, says he lied to police about what happened the night Ms Wood drowned . Ms Wood, 43, was on a yacht with Mr Wagner, . Christopher Walken and the boat captain on Thanksgiving weekend of 1981 . before she somehow ended up in the water. Lt Corina said Mr Walken gave a prepared statement and spoke to detectives for an hour. Detectives have also interviewed other actors who knew both Mr Wagner and Ms Wood to learn more about their relationship. Lt Corina said detectives have tried at least ten times to interview Mr Wagner but have been refused. He said some of the refusals have come from the actor's attorney, and that detectives at one point traveled to Colorado to try to speak with Mr Wagner but were unsuccessful. LtCorina said the latest inquiry had turned up new evidence. 'Most of the people we've talked to were never talked to 30 years ago,' he said. 'We've got a lot of new information.' Asked if the information might lead to criminal charges, Lt Corina said that would be up to prosecutors if they are presented with a case. 'All we can do is collect the facts,' he said. 'We're still trying to collect all the facts.' Lt Corina said new people have emerged with information each time the case is in the news. Detectives would like to interview other people who have not agreed to talk, he said. Coroner's officials released an updated autopsy report on Monday that detailed the reasons why Ms Wood's death certificate was changed last year from a drowning death to 'drowning and other undetermined factors.' The updated report states the change was made in part because investigators could not rule out that some of the bruises and marks on Ms Wood's body happened before she went into the water. Party: Ms Wood, Mr Wagner and actor Christopher Walken were aboard the boat - along with captain Dennis Davern (right) when she disappeared and drowned . Tragic: New information released in the last couple of years has cast suspicion on the original finding that Ms Wood's death was accidental (pictured here with Mr Wagner) 'Since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined by this medical examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined,' Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran wrote in the report completed in June. Officials also considered that Ms Wood was not wearing a life jacket, had no history of suicide attempts and didn't leave a note as reasons to amend the death certificate. She was famous for roles in films such as 'West Side Story' and 'Rebel Without a Cause' and was nominated for three Academy Awards. Conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht have contributed to the mystery of her death. Ms Wood, Mr Wagner and Mr Walken had all been drinking heavily in the hours before the actress disappeared. Mr Wagner wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and Mr Walken argued that night. He wrote that Mr Walken went to bed and he stayed up for a while, but that when he went to bed, he noticed that his wife and a dinghy that had been attached to the yacht were missing. 'Nobody knows,' he wrote. 'There are only two possibilities; either she was trying to get away from the argument, or she was trying to tie the dinghy. But the bottom line is that nobody knows exactly what happened.' The setup: On November 28, 1981, the 60-foot yacht Splendor set out for Santa Catalina Island, a rocky island off the coast of California, 22 miles from Los Angeles. Aboard were Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood and the boat's skipper, Dennis Davern. The couple also brought Ms Wood's newest costar, Christopher Walken, to celebrate their successful completion of filming for 'Brainstorm,' a science fiction thriller. Ms Wood, Mr Wagner and Mr Walken departed the yacht and rode a dingy to shore, where they had dinner at Harbor Reef Resultant on the island. Waitresses reported that all three Hollywood actors drank heavily - mostly champagne - and were rude and boisterous. Witnesses say all three were very intoxicated at about 10.15pm when they piloted the dingy back to the yacht, which was anchored offshore. Exactly what happened after the three returned to the boat remains a mystery. The tragedy: Ms Wood's body was found floating in the water about a mile from the yacht at about 8am on November 29 and the coroner determined that she had died of a combination of drowning and hypothermia. Her blood alcohol level at the time was . 0.14percent - nearly twice the legal limit for driving. She also had . motion sickness medication and painkillers in her system, which likely . increased her level of intoxication. The time of death is estimated at about midnight at on November 29. 'The fact that her stomach contained 500 cc of partially digested food material supports that opinion of that time of death being around midnight, especially given the information that dinner was consumed between 8 and 9pm,' according to the new report. However, Ms Wood was not reported missing until 1.30am - fully 90 minutes after she went overboard, according to an interview with the manager of the restaurant on shore.","Natalie Wood drowned, age 43, after going overboard her 60-foot yacht Splendor on November 29, 1981 .

Named after him: The BBC may reconsider renaming a wing at the London headquarters after John Peel following claims of an affair . The BBC may reconsider their decision to name part of their London headquarters after the late DJ John Peel amid claims he had an affair with a 15-year-old schoolgirl. Jane Nevin claimed she may have even become pregnant by Peel during a three-month affair she met the BBC star presenter backstage at a Black Sabbath concert in the summer of 1969. The plans to rename the Egton Wing of the BBC London headquarters, the Peel Wing are now being questioned following Mrs Nevin's claims. Mrs Nevin says she was ‘in awe’ of the . Radio 1 DJ, then 30, and that they would go to his London BBC studio or . backstage at concerts to make love. According to the BBC, . a BBC spokesman said: 'Clearly, in the event of proven allegations of . sexual abuse the BBC would reconsider its decision on the naming of part . of our new building.' The . renaming of the Broadcasting House was announced in March this year and . at the time, then-director general Mark Thompson said it was 'a fitting . tribute to a man who personified so much of what the BBC stands for'. Peel had unprotected sex with the teenager shortly after boasting on-air that he had been suffering from a venereal disease. They split up when her mother found out . about the relationship. But she discovered she was pregnant shortly . after, aged 16, and had a ‘traumatic’ abortion at a clinic in Ealing. ‘I was devastated when I found out I . was pregnant,’ she said. ‘I didn’t even think about telling John. I just . wanted it to be over.’ When . Mrs Nevin wrote to Peel out of the blue 30 years later mentioning their . ‘brief affair’, he replied expressing his relief that she was not . writing to confess she had his secret child. Younger days: Jane Nevin (aged 17) says she was 'in awe' of Radio 1 DJ John Peel, then 30, and that they would go to his London BBC studio or backstage at concerts to make love . On a postcard sealed in an envelope, Peel, who died in 2004, wrote: ‘Well, you’ve scared the daylights out of me. For years I’ve been expecting a letter starting, “In the 70s we had a brief affair – and your now son/daughter, aged 27, wants to meet you”.’ Mrs Nevin, 59, who lives in Capel, . Surrey, decided to break her silence after allegations emerged that . fellow BBC DJs abused dozens of teenage girls during this period. The . latest revelation will raise questions over the conduct of other . celebrities within the corporation during the 1960s and 1970s. She said: ‘He [Peel] must have known I was still at school. But he didn’t ask and I didn’t tell him. ‘At . the time I was just so happy to be on his arm. I was young and he was . famous. All I cared about was that I could make all my school friends . jealous. Peel Wing: The BBC announced in March that they were renaming the Egton Wing (pictured), the Peel Wing and at the time, then-director general Mark Thompson said it was 'a fitting tribute' ‘I was insecure and impressionable. I suppose I used him for his fame and he used me for sex.’ It echoes Peel’s own admission that he . received sexual favours from young fans, once quipping: ‘Well, of . course, I didn’t ask for ID.’ The DJ ran a Schoolgirl Of The Year . competition on his long-running late-night Radio 1 Show and once . complained that American virgins ‘would do anything but s*** you’. Mrs . Nevin met Peel when she was invited backstage at a Black Sabbath concert . in central London. She was hoping to meet the band, including Ozzy . Osbourne, but instead caught the eye of Peel. She . said: ‘He came over and started talking to me. I was totally in awe of . John. I adored his long hair and beard and he talked so intensely about . music. ‘After that night, we would meet up about once a week. If we had sex, we never went to his place. ‘It would always be in his studio or backstage at the Roundhouse in Camden. 'Didn't ask': Mrs Nevine claims that Peel (left in 1968, right in 2005) must have known she was still at school. She said 'he didn't ask and I didn't tell' ‘I loved the status of knocking around with him. He would invite me to gigs and I would follow him around like a lapdog. I don’t know if sex was expected but I went along with it willingly. Looking back, it was terribly wrong and I was perhaps manipulated. But it was a different era.’ She admits it was a difficult period in her life. ‘I was badly bullied at school for being posh. I went to private school in South London until I was 11, but when my father died, my mother couldn’t afford to keep me there so I went to the local comprehensive in Wandsworth. ‘I did horse riding and dance classes at Italia Conti. I didn’t fit in. As a result, I was desperate to be loved.’ At the time, Peel was separated from . Shirley Anne Milburn, a fan he had married in 1965 in America when she . was only 15. He later claimed she had lied about her age. When Mrs Nevin’s mother, an antiques restorer, found out her daughter was dating the DJ, she was horrified. ‘One night he called the house and my . mother gave him hell,’ said Mrs Nevin. ‘She knew he had spoken about . having VD because it had been in the papers. That put an end to us . seeing each other.’ Later, a . test confirmed she was pregnant. ‘My mother was very upset. She was . worried I had ruined my life. My auntie had to lend her the money and I . went to a clinic in Ealing. It was probably the worst day of my life.’ 'I was totally in awe of John. I adored his long hair and beard and he talked so intensely about music. After that night, we would meet up about once a week. If we had sex, we never went to his place' Jane Nevin . Mrs Nevin went on to become a bunny girl croupier at the Playboy club in Park Lane in the 1970s. She later ran a pub with her husband, from whom she is separated, and had a son, now 24. Peel divorced his teenage Texan bride Shirley in 1973 and married Sheila Gilhooly a year later. They had four children and lived in Great Finborough, Suffolk. It was from this address that he wrote the letter to Mrs Nevin in the late 1990s, after she asked him to appear at the opening of her new bar in Surrey. He rebuffed her invite, ending the postcard: ‘I live near Ipswich so Croydon is pretty inaccessible. I’ll wait to hear from you again, John.’ Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘We are asking that any criminal allegations should be passed either to the BBC investigations unit or directly to the police.’ An insider added: ‘This is another terrible allegation and hopefully she will take this to the police so they can investigate.’","The BBC announced plans to rename the Egton Wing, the Peel Wing in March this year .

"By . Oliver Pickup . UPDATED: . 07:55 EST, 30 August 2011 . An American filmmaker who was held in solitary confinement in Libya's most notorious prison for months has told of his harrowing ordeal, now that he has been released. Matthew van Dyke, a 32-year-old from Baltimore, was close to suicide after spending six months in a cell measuring 7ft by 4ft at Tripoli's Abu Salim prison - where, in 1996, Colonel Gaddafi had ordered the massacre of 1,200 prisoners. Just as the revolution against they Libyan tyrant's 42-year rule was beginning to gather speed, he was caught up in the paranoia of the man known as mad dog. Scroll down to see a video of Mr van Dyke after his release . Looking pale and thin, the bearded American filmmaker is coming to terms with his six months in solitary confinement in a Libyan jail . One minute he was taking a photograph of a man serving coffee in the small north-eastern town of Brega, and the next he was being hauled into jail by government forces, where a man was being loudly tortured in the room above him. And now, with Colonel Gaddafi seemingly defeated and Tripoli liberated, Mr van Dyke, who said that his Christian faith helped him though the ordeal, has been freed and can tell his story. When a crowd wrestled open his tiny cell after six months he feared it was an angry mob who thought he was a CIA spy and would lynch him. But, to his relief, it was rebels and prisoners breaking him out of Abu Salim prison at the end of last week. A man, freed after the rebels took control of Tripoli, takes a photograph with his mobile phone of the notorious Abu Salim prison . Mr van Dyke was captured in March by government soldiers and, after being interrogated in a basement in Brega overnight, he was then held incommunicado for six months in Tripoli . 'I was in solitary confinement the whole time with nothing to do but stare at the wall,' the now lanky and bearded man said. He described the months of enforced isolation with nothing to do as a kind of 'psychological torture'. He didn't even realise when his 32nd birthday came and went and, to distract himself, he read the ingredients on the milk cartons he received with his meals. Now that Colonel Gaddafi appears to have been defeated Mr van Dyke has been freed . 'When I got a German milk box somehow that had five languages on it, that was quite a treat,' he said. 'Keep that one and try to learn words in various languages - anything to break the monotony of staring at a wall.' His only human interaction was with the . guards that brought him his food, though when he was transferred to Abu Salim in Libya's capital, all they did was slide his plates through a . metal slot. 'It does incredibly unbelievable things - I'm still coming to terms with what I went through,' he said. 'It's absolutely shocking. I'm not really ready to talk about the extent of what went on psychologically to me. 'I would rather they [the guards] had just taken me . out and beat me, even every day, than go through the solitary . confinement, because what it does psychologically is astonishing. 'I had . no idea that the brain could work in the ways that it did in my case.' The filmmaker, who had just finished travelling from Iraq, through Iran and into Afghanistan by motorcycle, had not even visited the North Africa country to work - rather, he was visiting friends. A top security prison in Tripoli, Libya which is often described as 'notorious' and a 'site of egregious human rights violations' by human rights activists and other observers, Abu Salim was where, in 1996, Human Rights Watch believes that 1,270 prisoners were slaughtered. Some say that Western governments largely ignored this and no international inquiry was launched, due to 'oil interests'. The Libyan government said that the killings took place amid confrontation between their forces and rebels from the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, and that some 200 guards were also killed. But he figured that Gaddafi's men thought that he was an American spy, or a member of the CIA, and thought he would be cut off from society for decades, with no one - his family or loved ones knowing whether or not he was dead or alive. He was riding in a pickup truck through Brega, snapping pictures, when a . surprise advance by government forces caught him and his rebel friends . unaware. He doesn't remember what happened next. He had no media credentials and continued: 'I woke up in a cell with a man being tortured in the room above . me. 'I thought I was [going to be] there for 20 to 30 . years. I knew I was in a lot of trouble and I knew they were thinking . things because of the footage I was captured with, and that I was . doomed. 'I was there and there wasn't going to be any reason why I was getting out. 'I thought it was over and I would . never see my family again. One guy at the interrogation said, ""You will . never see America again,"" and I thought he was right.' The 32-year-old filmmaker, pictured in February, less than a month before he was imprisoned . By the light of a cell skylight the size of a dinner plate, he recorded his days in solitary on the wall next to marks made by the cramped room's previous occupants. His row grew to two to three times the others. 'That's when I realised there was a big problem with my situation,' he said. 'Those cells seem designed either to . temporarily hold people or to break their mind.' Though he was allowed out of the cell . three times a day to use the toilet and was given food such as bread and . cheese, couscous, rice, pasta and chicken, he admitted that he manufactured a make-shift noose. 'I took yarn from the blanket and I . made bracelets and a ball and a belt to hold my pants up, which was . eventually taken from me because they thought I might hang myself with . it. 'I also made it strong enough so it . would double as a noose if I needed it, and I hid a plastic bag from . them in case I needed it. In case I decided to take my own life, I . wanted to have the means available to do it.' And then, suddenly, it was all over - there were a series of loud noises and then he could hear a crowd breaking open the gates to his cell block. As they bashed open his cell door he expected to be grabbed and murdered for being a spy, but instead they just moved on to the next cell. 'One guy said ""Gaddafi is finished!"" and I didn't believe it,' he said, and other prisoners hesitated to leave their cells, fearing it was some kind of trick. Mr van Dyke added: 'I said: ""How [is Gaddafi finished]?"" [One of the prisoners] said: ""We don't know. We don't know. Let's go."" So I took a chance and thought all right, let's go.' When free he called Lauren, his girlfriend of five years, and his mother, Sharon, who had been lobbying hard for his release. However, he does not want to return home to Baltimore until he discovers the fate of his three friends, whom he believes may be imprisoned in Gaddafi's hometown, Sirte. 'I told them: ""I go home when Libya is free."" And that's why I'm still here.'","American missed his birthday and was close to suicide .

Joyce Brothers, the 'mother' of pop psychologist who pioneered the television advice show in the 1950s and enjoyed a long and prolific career as a syndicated columnist, author, and television and film personality, has died. She was 85. Brothers died Monday in New York City, according to her longtime publicist, Sanford Brokaw. 'She passed away peacefully and in her home ... with her family all around her,' said her daughter Lisa Brothers. Brothers first gained fame on the iconic game show 'The $64,000 Question' and went on to publish 15 books and make cameo appearances on popular shows including 'Happy Days' and 'The Simpsons.' She visited Johnny Carson on 'The Tonight Show' nearly 100 times. Much Loved: In this Sept. 1, 1987 file photo, Dr. Joyce Brothers takes a break from a busy schedule in Los Angeles to talk about her upcoming television series, 'The Psychology Behind the News.' 'I was a very big fan of hers,' said TV psychologist and author Dr. Phil McGraw on Monday to USA Today. 'I started studying psychology back in 1968 or 1969 and she was a very present force at that time. 'I truly think she was a pioneer. Here comes a woman who was articulate, educated and very credible. 'She talked about these things and took them mainstream and laid a lot of important groundwork for those to come later,' said McGraw, host of the Dr. Phil show. 'She wasn't some pop psychologist. In her advice column and her television work, gave clear analysis and advice.' The way Brothers liked to tell it, her multimedia career came about 'because we were hungry.' It was 1955. Her husband, Milton Brothers, was still in medical school and Brothers had just given up her teaching positions at Hunter College and Columbia University to be home with her newborn, firmly believing a child's development depended on it. But the young family found itself struggling on her husband's residency income. So Brothers came up with the idea of entering a television quiz show as a contestant. 'The $64,000 Question' quizzed contestants in their chosen area of expertise. She memorized 20 volumes of a boxing encyclopedia — and, with that as her subject, became the only woman and the second person to ever win the show's top prize. This undated file photo shows Dr.Joyce Brothers in the studio of her direct line radio show. Brothers saved a would-be suicide in 1968.

She . later denied any knowledge of cheating, and during a 1959 hearing in . the quiz show scandal, a producer exonerated her of involvement. Her celebrity opened up doors. In 1956, she became co-host of 'Sports Showcast' and frequently appeared on talk shows. Mrs. Brothers appeared as a color commentator on CBS for a boxing match . between Carmen Basilio and Sugar Ray Robinson, but her expertise in . psychology became her focus once again a short time later. Two years later, NBC offered her a trial on an afternoon television program in which she advised on love, marriage, sex and child-rearing.

Its success led to a nationally telecast program, and subsequent late-night shows that addressed such taboo subjects as menopause, frigidity, impotence and sexual enjoyment. She also dispensed advice on several phone-in radio programs, sometimes going live. She was criticized by some for giving out advice without knowing her callers' histories. But Brothers responded that she was not practicing therapy on the air and that she advised callers to seek professional help when needed. Mrs. Brothers was noted for two on-air incidents in which she prevented . troubled people from committing suicide – once in 1965, and once on . radio in 1971. In the latter incident, Mrs. Brothers comforted a woman . who had overdosed on sleeping pills, and kept her on the line for three . and a half hours, the Paley Center recalled. Despite criticism of the format, the call-in show took off, and by 1985, the Association of Media Psychologists was created to monitor for abuses. For almost four decades, Brothers was a columnist for Good Housekeeping. She also wrote a daily syndicated advice column that appeared in more than 350 newspapers. A constant presence during on the small screen during the 1960s and beyond, Brothers hosted her own nationally syndicated television shows which included, 'The Dr. Joyce Brothers Show', 'Ask Dr. Brothers' and 'Living Easy with Dr. Joyce Brothers.' Celebrity Appearances: Joyce Brothers (3rd left) appears with (from left) Marion Ross, Tom Bosley,  Ron Howard, Henry Winkler, Erin Moran, Anson Williams in 'Happy Days' In this Jan. 16, 2004 file photo, psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, left, and Bruce Spizer, author of 'The Beatles are Coming' are interviewed at a news conference in New York . Later, Brothers branched out into film, playing herself in more than a dozen movies, including 'Analyze That' (2002), 'Beethoven's 4th' (2001), 'Lover's Knot' (1996) and 'Dear God' (1996). She was also an advocate for women. In the 1970s, Brothers called for changing textbooks to remove sexist bias, noting that nonsexist cultures tend to be less warlike. The quiz show scandal of 1958-59 was one of the biggest scandals in the history of television. It erupted in 1958 when it was revealed that quiz show producers had been rigging the outcome of some shows, including 'The $64,000 Question,' by giving favored contestants the answers in advance. Brothers was one of a number of big winners who told an Associated Press survey in November 1959 that they knew nothing of any cheating. At a House hearing that month, associate producer Mort Koplin also said Brothers was among those not involved in cheating. Dr. Phil McGraw paid tribute to Joyce Brothers on her death today at the age of 85 . Television personality Joyce Brothers arrives for the ""She Made It: Women Creating Television and Radio"" salute at the Museum of Television & Radio in Beverly Hills, California, in this December 5, 2006, file photo . But he also described how contestants, who were carefully interviewed in advance, could be affected unknowingly as producers tried to manipulate the outcome of shows by tailoring questions to benefit favored ones and oust less-favored ones. According to the testimony, Brothers applied to be a '64,000 Question' contestant as an expert in home economics and psychology. The producers, looking for an audience-pleasing oddity, suggested the pretty young woman try boxing as her specialty. She learned the subject so well, Koplin said, she kept on winning even after the producers 'threw the book' at her with tough questions aimed at eliminating her. Born Joyce Diane Bauer in New York, Brothers earned her bachelor's degree from Cornell University and a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia. She wrote numerous advice books, including 'Ten Days To A Successful Memory' (1964), 'Positive Plus: The Practical Plan for Liking Yourself Better' (1995) and 'Widowed' (1992), a guide to dealing with grief written after the death of her husband in 1990. Brothers is survived by sister Elaine Goldsmith, daughter Lisa Brothers Arbisser, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.","Joyce Brothers passes away peacefully at her home in New York City on Monday .

This handout file photo provided by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections shows Johnny Dale Black. Black, who is convicted of killing prominent horse trainer Bill Pogue in 1998 and who was executed on Tuesday, Dec. 17 . Oklahoma on Tuesday executed a 48-year-old man convicted of the 1998 stabbing death of a horse trainer from Ringling. Johnny Dale Black was pronounced dead at 6:08 p.m. Tuesday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester after telling his mother he loved her. He was the second inmate executed by the state in the past two weeks and the sixth put to death in Oklahoma this year. Black was convicted of first-degree murder for fatally stabbing Bill Pogue, 54, during a roadside attack near the southern Oklahoma town that left Pogue with 11 stab wounds, broken ribs and punctured lungs. Pogue's son-in-law, Rick Lewis, was also attacked. Lewis suffered more than a dozen wounds but later recovered. He had been looking for someone else, according to court documents. Black was one of five men who went out hunting for a man who had threatened one of the five because he had been having an affair with the man's soon to be ex-wife, according to court documents. The group was looking for the man's black sport-utility vehicle and instead encountered Pogue, who had gone to a convenience store with his son-in-law, Richard Lewis, to buy chewing tobacco and was driving home in a black SUV. The group of five men stopped their compact car in front of the SUV and attacked Pogue and Lewis, beating them and stabbing them more than 10 times each, according to court documents. Pogue died later from his wounds, while Lewis survived the roadside attack, according to court documents. The morning after the fight, Black fled to Texas, where he was later arrested and confessed to the crime, according to court documents. Johnny Dale Black was pronounced dead at 6:08 p.m. Tuesday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. He was the second inmate executed by the state in the past two weeks and the sixth put to death in Oklahoma this year . Black said he did not remember stabbing Lewis and said he was afraid for his brothers, who were part of the group in the fight, and did not intend to kill Pogue. At a hearing before the state Pardon and Parole Board last month, Black begged forgiveness for his actions. But he insisted that he was merely trying to defend his brother, Jimmy Black, from Pogue. The brothers had approached Pogue and Lewis after mistaking their car for that of someone else they had been searching for. 'I deserve to be punished for what I did, but not for defending my family,' Johnny Black told the board in November. About 15 minutes before the execution, fellow death row inmates began banging the doors of their cells in a tribute to the condemned man. Witnesses to the execution included Black's mother, his attorney and a spiritual adviser. Four members of the victim's family also attended. Before the lethal drugs were administered, Black, who was lying on a gurney with needles attached to both arms, made eye contact with his mother, and both shook their heads affirmatively. 'This isn't accomplishing anything,' Black said. 'It's just another death, another family destroyed.' Black did not apologize to the victim's family or acknowledge the crime he was convicted of. Looking at his mother, Black said, 'I love everybody. I love you. You can count on that, Momma.' As the lethal drugs were administered, Black took several deep breaths as his mother wept. Witnesses to the execution included Black's mother, his attorney and a spiritual adviser. Four members of the victim's family also attended . The victim's family did not make a statement after the execution. But Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said Black was sentenced to death by a jury of his peers 'for the murder of an innocent grandfather and upstanding member of the community.' Pogue's relatives and friends had petitioned the board last month to carry out the execution instead of commuting Black's death sentence to life in prison without parole. 'What will bring justice in this tragic case? How can atonement be made for this hideous murder?' wrote Pogue's widow, Lonnetta. 'No mercy was shown to Bill on that fateful night. He got no second chances at life. 'I ask you, board members, to let justice be done,' she wrote. Lewis related the mental anguish and survivor's guilt he's experienced since 1998. 'Tell me how, as the only surviving victim, that I can explain the feeling of being the one that survived,' Lewis said. 'Tell me how to explain to my son — who was 18 days old when this happened — how his daddy couldn't save his granddad.' Pogue's son, Charles Pogue, told the board how the family has battled through bouts of depression and 'extreme anger' since Pogue was killed. 'Dad got to be a grandfather for 18 days before his life was taken,' Charles Pogue said. 'Unfortunately, my two daughters never got to meet their pops. 'I also haven't had the heart to tell them what happened that evening. It's hard to figure out how to tell a 12 and 5-year-old about how evil a person can be,' he said. Randy Bauman, Black's attorney, declined last week to comment on the case. Black was previously convicted of manslaughter for the 1984 death of Cecil Martin, 49. Black served nine years of a 15-year sentence in that case. The Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty said it was planning a demonstration and then a silent vigil outside the governor's mansion Tuesday night to protest the execution.","Johnny Dale Black, 54, was executed in front of his mother and four members of his victim's family on Tuesday at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester ."
"By . Matt Roper . and Chris Parsons . PUBLISHED: . 03:52 EST, 23 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:57 EST, 23 April 2012 . Brazil secretly helped supply weapons to Argentina during the Falklands War, it was revealed today. Brazil was officially neutral in the 1982 conflict, which began 20 years ago this month when Argentine forces occupied the islands. But secret Brazilian government documents revealed today that Argentina's South American neighbour provided logistical support for the supply of arms for use against British forces - and even bought bombs and ammunition for Argentina's military junta. Support: An Argentinian bomb explodes on the Royal Navy frigate HMS Antelope at the height of the Falklands dispute in May 1982 . The document claims Recife airport in Brazil was at one point receiving two flights a day from Buenos Aries of planes packed with ammunition and explosives (file picture) A document from Brazil's National Security Council, unearthed by the O Globo newpaper, reported that Argentina regularly contacted the Brazilian government with requests for help in the war effort. They included buying aeroplanes, incendiary bombs, ammunition for rifles, radar systems and aviation fuel. Brazil also allowed planes belonging to Argentina's national airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, but which were secretly carrying weapons from Libya and Cuba, to refuel at the country's airports. At one point Recife aiport in the northwest of Brazil was receiving two flights a day from Libya en route to Buenos Aires, packed with ammunition and explosives, according to another document from the Brazilian Navy. The supply of arms also departed from Israel with stopovers in the Canary Islands and Rio de Janeiro. Planes from Cuba - Brazil's enemy during the Cold War - were also allowed to pass through Brazilian airspace, loaded with guns, the document also reveals. Dispute: Brazil appeared to further back Argentina over the Falklands when new president Dilma Rousseff (above) banned a Royal Navy ship from docking in Rio earlier this year . When confronted about its clandestine support for its neighbour, however, Brazil flatly denied the charge. A . previously unseen letter from the British Embassy in Brazil was also . uncovered, accusing Brazil of allowing the landing of an Argentinian . plan loaded with weapons. In . response the Brazilian government said that in their inspection of the . Aerolineas Argentinas flight they 'didn't find anything of a military . nature.' Despite its claims to being officially neutral, Brazil is thought to have long supported Argentina in the territorial conflict. Both countries refer to the disputed islands as the 'Malvinas', with Brazil backing Argentina in the sovereignty dispute in 2010. The Brazilian government also stated that the UK's offshore oil exploration programme in the Argentinan continental shelf was 'illegal' and 'inconsistent with what determines the United Nations'. The reported . revelations about Brazil's support of Argentina may not come as a . surprise to many, given Brazil's stance when the Falklands dispute . erupted again earlier this year. In January Brazil took sides against Britain by refusing permission for a Royal navy ship to dock in Rio de Janeiro. HMS . Clyde, which patrols the waters around the Falklands, was forced to . switch course to Chile after being rebuffed by the Brazilians. Foreign . policy analysts claimed the new Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff was . trying to play the ‘anti-colonial card’ to satisfy the left-wing . factions of her Worker’s Party.","Newly-discovered document claims Argentina regularly asked South American neighbour for help during Falklands .

Veterans of the Arctic Convoys who risked their lives on what Churchill called ‘the worst journey in the world’ finally received proper recognition yesterday. The survivors – now in their 80s and 90s – were honoured with Arctic Star medals and an admission from David Cameron that he was ‘righting a wrong’. His proudest day: David Cameron chats to Frank Bond, 89, (right) as they take a walk aboard HMS Belfast alongside fellow Artic Star medal recipients Jock Dempster (centre) and Roy Dykes (left) Handshake: Prime Minister David Cameron presents the Arctic Star to World War II veteran Henry Dempster . Joy: Prime Minister David Cameron (right) shows a photograph of Winston Churchill to World War II veteran Ken Whiterod during an Arctic Star medal presentation at Downing Street in central London . Smiles: Prime Minister David Cameron presents the Arctic Star medal to World War II veteran Michael Alston . The presentation was a victory for the Daily Mail’s campaign to have the  medals struck. More than 3,000 Royal Navy and . merchant seamen died between 1941 and 1945 on the convoys. Only about . 200 veterans are still alive. The very first Arctic Star was awarded . to Commander Eddie Grenfell, 93, who has battled tirelessly for 16 . years for the convoy heroes to be recognised. He received his award from General Sir . David Richards, the head of the Armed Forces, at a special ceremony in . his home city of Portsmouth because of illness. Cdr Grenfell, released from hospital . three weeks ago after suffering a heart attack, was too poorly to attend . the main ceremony with 41 comrades in London. Heroes: Pictured in their youths are Former Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander Roy Dykes, (left) who served on 16 arctic convoy missions, surviving on a daily diet of a single piece of bread and corned beef, and Jock Dempster, one of the leading veterans in the campaign to award the Arctic Convoy seamen a medal . But he received a letter of . congratulations from the Prime Minister, who announced in December that . the Arctic Star would be awarded, along with the new Bomber Command . Clasp. It praised Cdr Grenfell’s campaign  and the ‘extraordinary bravery and fortitude of a very special group of men’. Victory for campaign: The Mail in December last year . Cdr Grenfell, who survived ten minutes . in the icy Arctic waters before he was rescued after his ship SS Empire . Lawrence was bombed in May 1942, said: ‘It is absolutely wonderful. We . deserve this but it has been a frustrating battle against bureaucratic . injustice. ‘It is sad that so many of my comrades are not alive today to receive their medals.’ Sir David, the Chief of the Defence . Staff, asked to personally present Cdr Grenfell’s medal ‘on behalf of . the nation’. He said: ‘It’s a very, very special day for all of us in . the Armed Forces, but especially for a small group who are still with us . who did some very special things way back in the Second World War. ‘It’s hard to comprehend what you and your comrades did battling against an enemy intent on your destruction. ‘What Eddie and his comrades did was . to ensure Russia could stay in the war at a very, very difficult time. If they had been beaten by the Nazis then probably we would have been . beaten. ‘So a small group of people played a . vital role in something as massive as winning the war.’ The Arctic . Convoys were perilous missions to keep Russian supply lines open.

The convoys carried four million tons . of cargo including tanks, planes, fuel and food to slow  Germany’s . advances on the Eastern front. Arctic Star: Around 40 veterans were included in the first group to receive the newly-created medal . More than 66,000 Royal Navy sailors . and merchant seamen took part. In total, 87 merchant ships and 18 . British warships were sunk. But the Cold War meant it was . politically difficult to give the  survivors a medal for assisting  the . Soviet Union and it is only now that the Arctic Convoy  veterans have . been properly  recognised. Mr Cameron ordered the medals amid concerns . many veterans would die before they were awarded. Hosting a special ceremony in Downing . Street, he told the survivors: ‘I am only sorry that it has taken 70 . years to get to here and to say thank you for what you did. ‘You were involved in the most . important struggle of the last 100 years when you were supplying one of . our allies in the battle to defeat Hitler and to defeat fascism in . Europe. 'You are a group of heroes.’ The Prime Minister also joined three . Arctic Convoy veterans for  a tour of HMS Belfast, one of  the ships . which took part in  the mission. Afterwards, veteran Frank Bond, 89, . from Eltham, south east London, said: ‘It’s the culmination of 72 years . since I first went on the Russian convoy, to recognise not what I did . but what the sailors who gave their lives did. ‘I am not a hero, I am a survivor but the guys who went up there they really had it rough and a lot of them didn’t come back.’ Hard work: Chipping away ice on the deck of H.M.S. Vansittart on convoy escort duty in the Arctic in February 1943. More than 3,000 seamen died over four years on missions to keep open supply lines to Soviet ports . Arctic convoys: The seamen travelled what Winston Churchill dubbed the 'worst journey in the world' The leading figure behind the campaign to award the Arctic Star medal today had his award presented at a special ceremony because he was too ill to travel to the main presentation in London. Commander Eddie Grenfell, now 93, has lobbied tirelessly for 16 years for the medal to be created and was the first veteran to receive the star. After the decision was made last December to award the star, the Government was urged to act quickly because of the advancing age and ill-health of Cdr Grenfell as well as other veterans. Hero: Arctic convoy veteran Eddie Grenfell, 93, with his Arctic Star medal which he received from the Chief of the Defence Staff in Portsmouth today, and right, when he served in the war . Cdr Grenfell was only released from hospital three weeks ago where he had been since last October. He has suffered a heart attack and two cardiac arrests but managed to build up enough strength to attend today’s ceremony. The Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards attended the special event at the Mayor’s Parlour at Portsmouth Guildhall, Hampshire, to award Cdr Grenfell. The head of the UK armed forces had personally requested to attend the event to recognise Cdr Grenfell’s lobbying efforts as well as his service on four of the Arctic convoys to Russia. Cdr Grenfell arrived in a wheelchair supported by his family at the presentation. Cdr Grenfell’s campaign, supported by the Portsmouth News, gained massive popular support with a petition of 42,000 signatures being handed to Downing Street in 2004 as well as gaining support from local MPs. Sir David said: ‘It’s a very, very special day for all of us in the armed forces but especially for a small group who are still with us who did some very special things way back in the Second World War. Proud: Eddie Grenfell, 93, with his Arctic Star medal which he received from General Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff (left) and friends and family at the Mayor's Parlour in the Guildhall in Portsmouth . ‘We are here to celebrate the extraordinary bravery and fortitude of that very special group of men.’ He continued: ‘It’s hard to comprehend . what you and your comrades did battling against an enemy intent on your . destruction. It’s thoroughly humbling and we are all in awe of what you . achieved.’ And praising Cdr Grenfell’s medal . campaign, he said: ‘It was a conspicuous campaign in the way it was . conducted with great dignity.’ Get well soon: Cdr Grenfell received a letter from the Prime Minister wishing him a 'speedy recovery' He added: ‘I am delighted both personally and professionally to be here to present the very first Arctic Star on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, the armed forces and, may I say, the entire nation.’ Cdr Grenfell said he felt wonderful to be finally receiving the medal. He said: ‘If I were to mention the names of all the good people who have helped me and my deputy Lt Cdr Dick Dykes to win our 16-year long battle against bureaucratic injustice, our visitors would have to extend their stay in our beautiful city, Portsmouth. ‘I am, however, not so churlish to ignore the part played by our prime minister David Cameron in achieving today’s success. ‘He has, as I hear, always supported our claim for the award of the British Arctic Star but was hampered by bureaucracy, just as I was. ‘It is just sad that so many of my comrades are no longer with us to receive their medals today.’ He also thanked the Portsmouth News for supporting the campaign. His daughter, Trudie Grenfell, 65, said: ‘It’s an ecstatic, exciting, amazing day. He can finally put this to rest now after 16 years of hard work where he has sat up night after night at his computer fighting for all of them. I honestly didn’t think it would happen. ‘He’s in ill-health, he has only been out of hospital for three weeks now, he had been in since last October and there were two weeks when we thought he wouldn’t make it. ‘He had two cardiac arrests where they brought him back to life and then there was the heart attack. He certainly is a fighter and I do not think he’s stopped grinning since he got that thing (Arctic Star) in his hand.’ Cdr Grenfell was born in Montrose, Scotland, but left at the age of 16 when he joined the Royal Navy and made Portsmouth his home.","Delighted David Cameron hails the proudest day of his job as Prime Minister .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:56 EST, 26 January 2012 . The widow of U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy has broken her silence and is the focus of her daughter Rory's new documentary film, the Sundance premiere 'Ethel', which premiered at Sundance . Though initially reluctant when her daughter proposed the documentary, Ethel Kennedy opens up on screen with candid recollections about the family, including falling in love at first sight with her future husband on a ski trip to Canada. 'He was standing in front of an open fireplace,' she said in an interview alongside her daughter. 'I walked in the door and turned and saw him, and I thought, ""whoa"".' Ethel Kennedy, seen at Sundance this week, left, and with her husband a year before his 1968 death, right, says she fell in love with Robert Kennedy at first sight on a ski trip to Canada . In the film, Ethel Kennedy discusses campaigning for her husband and his brother, President John F. Kennedy, the similarities and differences between her family and the Kennedy clan, and raising 11 children after her husband's assassination in 1968. At the time, she was pregnant with Rory, her youngest child, who was born six months after her father's death. As a widow with such a big family, Ethel Kennedy said she coped simply by going about what she needed to do in tending her children. 'After Rory was born, it was — life just happened to take care of daily living, which almost had practically nothing to do with me,' she said. 'I just started taking carpools in the morning, and by the time I was finished dropping the last child off, I'd pick up the first one. And then, you know, I'm putting on all the galoshes. Well, you get the idea.' Robert Kennedy's widow speaks of coping to raise 11 children. Rory was born six months after his death.  At left us Ethel leaving the hospital with Rory and Ted Kennedy, and right is the mother-daughter duo now . In 'Ethel,' airing later this year on HBO, Rory Kennedy coaxes sweet, sad and funny anecdotes out of her mother and her siblings. The Kennedys recollect their mother's devotion to steeping the children in world affairs, her mischievous sense of humor and her rebellious streak that led to run-ins with the law, such as the time she was charged with rustling horses after freeing some mistreated animals. Through photos and home movies, the film offers an intimate look at the life of the Kennedys, the family relating how Robert Kennedy and his children slid down a bannister in the White House after his brother was elected and how the president once cautioned his fun-loving sister-in-law not to push his Cabinet members into the swimming pool anymore. In front of her daughter's camera, Ethel Kennedy is unable to discuss the grief over her husband's death. 'When we lost Daddy ...' she begins, then tears up and tells her daughter, 'Talk about something else.' Early end: Ethel (center in a striped dress) was by his side the night that Robert was killed by a gunman in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in California when he was running for president . ‘Ethel’ does not touch on the other family tragedies that befell Mrs Kennedy after her husband’s death. Her son David died of a drug overdose in 1984 and another son Michael was killed in a skiing accident in 1997. Rory Kennedy, whose past Sundance documentaries include the Emmy-winning 'Ghosts of Abu Ghraib,' said 'Ethel' probably was her most challenging film because it was so personal. 'I know my mother and she is just terrific, and I have such admiration and respect for her. She's such a character, too. I really think she's one of the great untold stories, not just because of all of the events she's lived through,' Rory Kennedy said. 'But also because she's just such a wonderful person, and I hope that comes across in the film. She's so funny, and she is such an inspiration to me. Our family knows my mother, our close friends know her, but to be able to share her with so many other people I think was important.' Ethel has gone to Sundance before to support her daughter's documentaries, but never as a the subject and star. Robert Redford and son Robert Kennedy Jr were both at her red carpet premiere last weekend . The film also reveals Robert Kennedy . feared his children would be blinded by the mafia in an acid attack as . revenge attack for investigating them. Ethel Kennedy said that her late husband was anxious they would be targeted as retaliation for his probe into mafia racketeering. He saw a report about an American journalist who had been blinded in an acid attack by the mob and feared they would do the same to him. The disclosure could add to conspiracy theories that the mafia may have been responsible for Kennedy’s death. He . was shot dead by Sirhan Sirhan in 1968 but speculation has raged that . his crusade against the mob whilst serving as U.S. Attorney General may . have be the root of his demise. Big Irish family: Robert and Ethel (seen at the back) had 11 children, two of whom died . Mrs . Kennedy, 83, said that her last husband was scared after New York Post . journalist Victor Riesel was blinded in an acid attack because of . articles he had written about the mob. ‘We were told they were going to do the same with our children,’ she said. Her eldest daughter Kathleen, one of several family members interviewed for the film, added: ‘We couldn’t leave school with the other kids at the end of the day. ‘We had to wait in the principal’s office to be picked up.’ The conspiracy theories relating to the . mob and the Kennedy family usually involve New Orleans mafia don Carlos . Marcello, who was deported to Guatemala by Mr Kennedy in 1961 after he . was appointed Attorney General by his brother John. Afterwards Marcello is said to have threatened John F Kennedy with the traditional Sicilian curse ‘Take the stone from my shoe’. And when the President died, Marcello associate Jimmy Hoffa is supposed to have said: ‘This means Bobby is out as Attorney General.’ Famous family: Ethel, far left, joined the elder Kennedy clan- including patriarch Joe (third from the left) and matriarch Rose (second from the left), and JFK and Jacqueline is in the center . She also reveals that it was very hard . for her husband to seek office for the first time and that he had to . ‘struggle for everything’ before becoming a senator in New York in 1964. There is also colour about her own . life including how she held wild parties which President Kennedy asked . her to tone down, and that she was once charged with horse theft after . she rescued a neighbour’s malnourished stallions. The Kennedy family were back in the . spotlight last week after John F. Kennedy Jr’s former assistant revealed . her deep regret for convincing his wife to board the doomed flight . which crashed and killed them both. In . her memoir RoseMarie Terenzio said she ‘should have kept her mouth . shut’ rather than speak to Carolyn Bessette on July 16, 1999.

The presence of flesh-eating drug Krokodil has been confirmed in western Mexico as authorities announced that a Houston-based teen was treated for the side effects of the ‘poor man’s heroin’ while on a trip south of the border. Doctors first thought that the 17-year-old was suffering from a sexually transmitted disease because the street drug had ruined her genitals. 'It wasn't sexually transmitted. She said she'd been using Krokodil for the last two months,' José Sotero Ruiz Hernández of Mexico's National Institute of Migration told local paper El Periodico Correo. Spreading: Officials in Puerto Vallarta feared that the 17-year-old girl who was treated for Krokodil obtained the drug in Mexico but it turns out she is from Houston, Texas and had been injecting the 'poor man's heroin' for two months prior . 'The young woman who used this drug had an infection that had rotted her genitals.' The victim has not been named and her status is unknown as she never returned to the clinic for a second check in. The head of the council on addictions in the western state of Jalisco, Dr. Enrico Sotelo, said young woman is a resident of Houston, Texas and not Mexico. She came to Mexico to visit the Pacific coast resort city of Puerto Vallarta where she has relatives, in November. Other victim: The drug was first found in Russia where many- including blind victim Margarita Schelkunova, pictured- came forward after receiving treatment for the drug in Siberia after using it for seven years . Flesh eating: There had been fears that flesh eating drug Krokodil was being used in Ohio. Angie Neitzel, 29 a drug addict, in Joliet, Illinois shows her wound from the drug . Soon . after, she checked into a local health clinic for digestive problems, . and it was there that doctors detected the flesh lesions. Dr Sotelo, who did not reveal the patient's name in accordance with privacy guidelines, said she told authorities she used the drug in Houston. Wounds: Krokidil causes terrible weeping sores and its use has been spreading across America . 'She acquired this problem with Krokodil in Houston, not here in Puerto Vallarta,' said Sotelo, who in any case has implemented an educational program to warn about the drug's ill effects. Sotelo said a survey of rehab centers and clinics in Jalisco had revealed there were no other local cases. He said so far, Mexico has detected only two probable cases, the woman in Puerto Vallarta and another person in the border state of Baja California. Diagnosis is usually based on the tell-tale lesions, because the body quickly metabolizes the drug's psychoactive agent, desomorphine. The drug was dubbed 'krokodil' in Russia because of greenish, scaly skin lesions addicts develop, giving them the appearance of having crocodile skin. A home-brewed heroin substitute popular in Russia, Krokodil is often concocted by cooking the prescription painkiller codeine along with gasoline, iodine, phosphorus and other chemicals.","The 17-year-old's name and current condition haven't been released .

New bank TSB is to be based in England and not its native Scotland ahead of its £1.5billion flotation on the stock market, it emerged today. The decision by Lloyds Banking Group to domicile TSB in England comes just seven months ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence, which could leave its existing Edinburgh headquarters in a foreign country. Financial firms have voiced concerns about the impact of independence on their ability to trade with the London markets if Scotland breaks away. Lloyds is to domicile the new TSB bank in England ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence . The TSB brand was resurrected by Lloyds Banking Group last year to hold the 631 branches it was ordered to sell by European regulators as a condition for receiving a £20billion government bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. Lloyds is expected to sell between 30 and 50 per cent of its stake in TSB this summer, with analysts expecting the business to be worth up to £1.5billion pounds. TSB will be put in TSB Banking Group Plc has been registered at Companies House in London and is incorporated in England and Wales, the Telegraph reported. By contrast TSB Bank Plc  and Lloyds Banking Group Plc are both incorporated in Scotland. The revelation comes as unionists were warned . against ‘complacency’ after the pro-independence campaign narrowed the . gap in the bitter referendum battle. A . Survation poll for the Scottish Daily Mail has found that support for . the break-up of Britain is now at 37.7 per cent among those who say they . will vote in September’s contest. That . is a very slight rise from 37 per cent in the most recent comparable . polls, carried out by Panelbase and ICM in January and February. Rock legend David Bowie has . electrified the debate over Scottish independence, issuing a plea for . people north of the border to 'stay with us'. The . high profile message to voters ahead of September's referendum was . delivered by supermodel Kate Moss as she collected a Brit Award on his . behalf at last night's star-studded ceremony. Politicians . battling to preserve the United Kingdom seized on the singer's . comments, but critics were quick to point out that Bowie lives in New . York. Reading a statement on behalf of the singer, Moss said: 'Good evening ladies and gentleman, David has asked me to say this. 'In Japanese myth the rabbits from my old costume that Kate's wearing live on the moon. 'Kate comes from Venus and I from Mars, so that's nice. I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male, but I am, aren't I Kate? I think it's a great way to end the day. 'Thank you very, very much and Scotland - stay with us’. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told LBC . 97.3: 'I hope we do stay together in the United Kingdom, as does David . Bowie - one of my great childhood heroes.' A spokesman for TSB Bank said: ‘Lloyds Banking Group intends to sell TSB Bank via an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2014. ‘As part of the process for preparing for the IPO, Lloyds Banking Group has established a new holding company for TSB called TSB Banking Group plc. ‘The new company replaces an existing company which currently holds TSB Bank in the LBG corporate structure and like this existing company will be registered in London at TSB’s main office. ‘Establishing new companies as part of a listing or IPO process is standard practice.  The Board of the new company will mirror that of TSB Bank.  The completion of the restructure is subject to regulatory approval.’ Lloyds insisted that TSB will remain a Scottish bank because that is where it is licensed. Voters will go to the polls in the historic referendum on Scottish independence on September 18, 2014. Homeowners have been warned they face crippling mortgage . increases of almost £5,200-a-year if an independent Scottish Government . walks away from its share of the national debt. Chief . Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander yesterday said there would be . a ‘premium’ to borrow from the markets, which would eventually trickle . down to families and businesses. After . Westminster politicians last week ruled out a deal to share the British . pound with an independent Scotland, panicked Scottish ministers . retaliated by threatening to refuse to take their share of the UK’s . national debt - estimated at around £130billion. Critics . said the move would horrify the international money markets, destroying . Scotland’s reputation and leaving the country with a dismal credit . rating - which would ultimately push up costs for businesses and . mortgage holders. Scotland . would join the ranks of Ecuador, Grenada, Paraguay, Argentina and . Indonesia as one of the countries that has defaulted on debt since 2000. Today, Argentina is still paying its price in the debt markets for its . last default. In contrast, the UK Government has not failed to honour its payments since the reign of King Charles II in 1672. Yesterday, . Mr Alexander said independent analysis from Jefferies investment bank . suggests there would be a considerable ‘premium’ for an independent . Scotland in the money markets if a share of the national debt was . refused. “They have . suggested that under those circumstances there would be a premium of . more like five percentage points in that default scenario,' he told . MSPs. 'Assuming a 75 per . cent pass through from bond rates to mortgage rates would be an extra . cost of about £5,200 on an average mortgage cost in Scotland. None . of these things are certain, but you see the range of financial risks . that come with borrowing under an independence framework.' One of the big battlegrounds between supporters and opponents has been whether an independent Scotland would be better off. The financial sector trade body - Scottish Financial Enterprise – this month claimed a Yes vote would mean products and services needing to be tailored to a new regime for tax, consumer protection and regulations. It would be a major blow for the financial services which employs 100,000 people in Scotland, generating £11.2billion each year.","Lloyds to domicile new challenger bank in England and not Scotland .

Young stars: Luther Burrell, Manu Tuilagi and Kyle Eastmond talk tactics at the Stadio Olimpico . That means this is the perfect dress rehearsal for the scenario in which England need to dramatically boost their points difference. It could be the difference between facing South Africa in the quarter-finals or Samoa - or not making the knockout stages at all. As well as Wales and Australia at the World Cup, England are likely to face Fiji and a team such as Georgia. England should manage a cricket score against Georgia, but Fiji at full strength are every bit as good as Italy - and that is the fixture which England should have in the back of their minds today. This season, both Manchester City and Arsenal came second in their Champions League groups on goal difference and consequently found themselves facing - and going out to - Bayern Munich and Barcelona. There is no silver lining in losing on points difference and the England team should view coming second as failure. We’re surely setting our sights too low if we are celebrating beating Scotland, Ireland and Wales. You cannot replicate the intensity of the Wales week in the build-up to facing Italy because there is no chance of defeat so you have to create that edge by demanding your players belt Italy. Big game? England won't be able to replicate the intensity of the victory over Wales last week . TWO LINES OF ATTACK . England now have the confidence and the personnel to attack with two running lines at once, which forces defenders to hesitate before committing to a tackle. Owen Farrell can read a defence and either pass a flat ball to a direct runner such as Luther Burrell (option 1) or throw the ball deep behind to Billy Twelvetrees (option 2), who can himself read the open field and choose to attack himself, pass inside or release Mike Brown out wide. The flexibility and versatility of attacking like this makes England’s dynamic back three even more dangerous. Brown has made the most metres (410), most clean breaks (7) and beaten most defenders (20). England must get him the ball in space. NEW BALL GAME . Attention to detail is key to being clinical and I’m pleased that England ensured the adidas match ball was sent over from Italy for training. Its panelling is different to the Gilbert ball that the players are used to handling, so it can feel different to the fingers and fly differently off the boot. With the need to rack up a huge score, it is very important Farrell has been using it for kicking practice this week. All smiles: The England team pose with the Triple Crown trophy after the game . The new challenge, and the way to get the players pumped up, is to put the competition’s minnows to the sword. This is not demanding the undoable - England score on average 39 points and 4.6 tries per game against Italy - but it is time to smash them again. Last year England failed to score a try against Italy at Twickenham, while on our last three visits to Rome, England failed to win by more than five points. That is unacceptable. The mindset must be to score as many points as you possibly can because imagine the nervousness in the Irish dressing room if they know they suddenly have to beat France by more than 15 points. My ambition would be to score eight tries. I would make it clear to the team that unless England have scored four tries by half-time, I’m taking you off and I am changing the back line. Danny Care, Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell would all come off and I would start the second half with Lee Dickson and George Ford as my half-backs, and Farrell shifting to inside centre alongside Manu Tuilagi. What a fantastic back division to bring on and a totally different midfield axis. Impact: I would bring on Lee Dickson (left) and George Ford at half-time, depending on the score . Star sub: And Tuilagi could change the game if he replaces Luther Burrell . I would have called a team meeting on Monday morning to set the agenda for the week. You warn the players that as soon as you feel the performance is slipping, you are bringing your substitutes on. In fact, I would even consider making the target three tries by the half-hour mark and warn my players that they will not even see out the first half unless they deliver. Would I share this with the media? Why not. This is a week to play with people’s minds and really put them under pressure and see how they respond. You generate intensity by raising expectation, not talking down England’s chances. Do not accept this is another game. You need possession to score points so a key requirement is to keep the ball in play as much as possible. The ambition must be never to kick the ball away. Ireland had possession against Italy for 26min 45sec so I want to see England smash that record by 20 per cent (England’s best so far is 22min 56sec in their opening match in Paris) Rallying call: I would have called a team meeting, to let them know if standards slip, subs will come on . Big boot: Farrell must try to keep the ball in play, and not allow stoppages . Second of all, you need to ensure the referee allows the game to be played to your tempo. You make sure captain Chris Robshaw is in his ear all game, making sure he stops the clock immediately if someone is injured so no seconds are wasted. If you win a penalty, kick to the corner quickly and Courtney Lawes should pre-call the line-out while the pack are running to take it. Drop goals are worth taking if the ball is slow and the defence is set, but make the decision quickly and start again. Saturday is the day to really show off England’s new all-court game. England have developed a pack of forwards who love to handle the ball so they would relish this challenge. Quality delivery at the breakdown is key, so players must commit in number to sort the mess out and give the backs slick, quick ball. Game changers: It's time for England's forwards to show off their new quick game, especially Courtney Lawes . Crunch clash: Can Chris Robshaw lead this team to glory? The Six Nations is here for the taking . The key thing to stress is that you do not need to force the tries or score off every phase. If England are clinical in execution then the points will come. I would paste up on the wall of the changing room a poster of numbers - the lowest error count in a Six Nations match, the highest number of turnovers, the highest number of tries, and demand the team beat those figures. No team have ever managed three or fewer handling errors or turnovers in a match. If you commit no errors you keep the intensity of the game up and the ball in play for longer. This Six Nations is still there for the taking. I just hope England realise that.","Second is failure for England, they should go all-out against Italy .

A mother-of-three is unable to stand up for more than a minute without fainting because of a rare condition. Kathryn Marshall was involved in a car accident two years ago after which she began to suffer from bouts of dizziness and fainting. The condition made her pass out every time she queued at the shops or walked her children to school - she couldn’t even hug her children without risking collapse. Scroll down for video . Kathryn Marshall, 38, has a rare condition which means she faints if she stands up for more than a minute. She says she just want to be a 'proper mummy' to Harry, 8, (far left), Erin, 6, (left) and Chloe, 10, (right) After a string of tests and medical examinations baffled doctors finally diagnosed the 38-year-old with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS). The rare condition causes her heart rate to shoot up when moving from a sitting to standing position, leaving her with extreme feelings of light headedness and restricting blood flow to her brain. The rare condition has made her life increasingly difficult as she longs to be a ‘proper mummy’ to her children and live a ‘normal family life’, but cannot get up from the sofa. Mrs Marshall, from Swansea, said: ‘All of the things I used to take for granted, I now have no control over. ‘And it is the little things that I miss the most. I can’t play with my kids like I want to, I can’t even make it up the stairs without having to sit down half way. ‘The guilt I experienced from not being able to be a proper mummy to my three little ones was terrible.’ Mrs Marshall (pictured on holiday with her children and husband, Chris, before her illness) has Postural Tachycardia Syndrome which causes her heart rate to rocket when she stands up . Mrs Marshall (pictured with daughter Chloe) developed the rare condition after being involved in a car crash two years ago. She spent four weeks in hospital before being diagnosed . After being diagnosed, Mrs Marshall had to give up her job as a nurse and solely relied on husband Chris, 41, to run the family home. Simple tasks such as doing the washing up are now almost impossible for her. She has suffered a series of dramatic falls in public and at home - and is constantly covered in bruises and cuts from her falls. But she is determined to push on to give her three children - Chloe, ten, Harry, eight, and Erin, six - the chance to go to the park or on a family holiday. Mrs Marshall said: ‘There are so many things that they want to do and I want to do with them. The condition means Mrs Marshall is constantly falling over so she is always covered in cuts and bruises . Mrs Marshall faints every time she stands in a queue or walks her children to school. She has even fallen down a flight of stairs after collapsing . ‘But I know that it will just wear me out and make me feel ten times worse if I do. It’s very confusing and upsetting for the children - they beg me to play with them, they say “please mummy”. ‘It just breaks my heart to have to say no to them. I feel like they are missing out on so much and it’s all down to me.’ Mrs Marshall was involved in a car crash in March 2011 which left her with a whiplash injury to her neck. In the weeks after she started to have palpitations and to become breathless - symptoms she blamed on the stress of the accident and looking after three children. But six weeks later she collapsed and spent four weeks in hospital and, after thorough testing, was diagnosed with PoTS. Mrs Marshall has to take 12 tablets every day to keep her symptoms at bay, to lower her heart rate and blood pressure and to prevent her from fainting . Mrs Marshall: 'When I was first diagnosed everything was very bleak. No one knew what was wrong with me - it was terrifying' The young mother has to take 12 tablets every day to keep her symptoms at bay, to lower her heart rate and blood pressure and to prevent her from fainting. Mrs Marshall has also sustained a number of serious injuries after collapsing unexpectedly, including falling down a flight of stairs which left her battered and bruised. She added: ‘When I was first diagnosed everything was very bleak. No one knew what was wrong with me - it was terrifying. ‘But I have just had to learn how to live my life in a different way. On the outside I look completely normal. Mrs Marshall said: 'There are so many things that they want to do and I want to do with them. It breaks my heart to say no to them. I feel like they are missing out on so much and it's all down to me' Mrs Marshall said: 'When I was first diagnosed everything was very bleak. No one knew what was wrong with me - it was terrifying. But I have just had to learn how to live my life in a different way' ‘I put on a smile and do my hair and make-up. ‘But it is hidden deep within me - it is a hidden disability. I just try to think positively and I am very determined. I will beat it.’ Mrs Marshall has now returned to her job at a general practitioner clinic and taken up two days as a nurse. She said: ‘Fortunately it’s sitting down so I can carry on working without worrying about my condition.’ PoTS is an abnormal response by the nervous system to standing up. It causes an increase in heart rate and altered blood supply to the brain. This causes dizziness, fainting, tiredness and palpitations. Other symptoms of PoTS include shakiness, shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches and stomach problems. Some patients find the condition very disabling while others have mild symptoms and get better without any treatment. The condition can be triggered by an illness, pregnancy, trauma and immunisations. It can also occur in teenagers who experience a sudden growth spurt. In some cases the condition results from another illness such as diabetes, MS or Lyme disease. Source: PoTS UK .","Kathryn Marshall got Postural Tachycardia Syndrome after a car crash .

It was billed as the must-see music event of the year – but the BBC’s wall-to-wall coverage of Glastonbury Festival left many viewers reaching for the remote. Amid criticisms the Corporation’s coverage was ‘inane, vacuous and sycophantic’, more people chose to watch a repeat of 1995 action film Die Hard With A Vengeance than tune in to the Rolling Stones’ headline gig on BBC2. Almost 300 BBC presenters, editors and technicians were sent to the four-day event in Somerset at a cost of £2million. The real deal: The Rolling Stones' live performance drew crowds of more than 170,000. But a repeat of Die Hard 3 attracted a larger TV audience . Distraction: Critics said the BBC's coverage took away from the live music. £2 milllion was spent to send almost 300 BBC presenters and technicians to Glastonbury . The Corporation provided . more than 250 hours of coverage on TV and radio, plus a continuous live . stream online, making the festival almost impossible to ignore. For . about an hour on Saturday night, it was televised simultaneously on . BBC2, BBC3 and BBC4. It was also covered in the main evening news . bulletin on BBC1 just minutes earlier. And . even those who prefer hymns to rock and roll were unable to avoid it as . BBC1’s Songs of Praise had a festival-themed edition yesterday, . including a pre-recorded interview with Glastonbury organiser Michael . Eavis. Fans who were keen . to see the performances also complained that the BBC’s presenters were . ‘annoying’ and filled the airwaves with ‘boring chit chat’ which . distracted from the live music. The highlight of the event was the . Rolling Stones’ two-hour set on Saturday – but the BBC was allowed to . broadcast only the last hour of it after a rights dispute. A . euphoric live audience – including Kate Moss, Stella McCartney and . Prince Harry – watched. Fan John Simmons, 29, said: ‘They were out of . this world. The best I have ever seen at Glastonbury’. Saturday night appeal: Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis star in Die Hard With A Vengeance . But it seems the BBC’s TV audience were less keen. Throughout the evening, an average of 1.28million viewers watched, peaking at 2.54million as the Stones began their set. By comparison, an average audience of 2.78million tuned in to a repeat of Die Hard, starring Bruce Willis, on BBC1. On Saturday afternoon, the figures were even worse. Just 800,000 watched the festival, compared with 2.6million who tuned in to Wimbledon on BBC1 and 849,000 who watched Midsomer Murders on ITV. A BBC spokesman said the BBC2 viewing figures were around three times higher than the average for the timeslot and said the BBC’s Glastonbury website picked up an extra one million unique users as others tuned in online. Festival fanatic Heidi Wesson, 33, from Leicester gave birth at the event’s medical centre just after the Rolling Stones’ set on Saturday. The Tesco customer services officer and her new daughter were ‘fine and fabulous’, according to partner Sean Crothers.","BBC spent £2million sending 300 BBC presenters and technicians to Glastonbury .

"By . James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 18:58 EST, 2 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:51 EST, 3 January 2014 . Listeners to BBC Radio 4's flagship Today programme awoke to the news on November 5 last year that immigrants who had come to Britain since 2000 had made a 'substantial' contribution to the country's public finances. The findings of the study by University College London were also given huge coverage across the BBC's TV bulletins and its website. BBC News Online said the authors, Professor Christian Dustmann and Dr Tommaso Frattini, had found that, rather than being a 'drain' on the Exchequer, the contribution of immigrants had been 'remarkably strong'. Sarah Montague (right), pictured with John Humphries (left), uncritically trotted out the findings of a study on immigration to suggest the public had nothing to fear from the prospect of a significant new influx . Those from the European Economic Area (EEA) – the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein – were said to have made 'a particularly positive contribution in the decade up to 2011, contributing 34 per cent more in taxes than they received in benefits'. Immigrants from outside the area, meanwhile, were reported as having contributed 2 per cent more in taxes than they received in the same period. Ever since the UCL report's publication, it has been treated as an article of faith by BBC presenters. Not surprisingly, on Wednesday, as restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK were lifted, Today presenter Sarah Montague uncritically trotted out its findings to suggest the public had nothing to fear from the prospect of a significant new influx. Yet, as the Mail reported yesterday significant questions are now being asked about the accuracy of the academics' report, which other experts say contains 'schoolboy errors'. Mervyn Stone, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at UCL, and statistician Nigel Williams of the Right-leaning think-tank Civitas suggested yesterday it was a 'fatally flawed' piece of work. The failings they identify are complex, and relate to the methodology used to work out the impact migrants are having on housing and the transport network. But the main problem, say Professor Stone and Mr Williams, is that the researchers started with the assumption that immigration was positive for Britain. They then made a series of other assumptions to prove that this belief – almost as an article of faith for many at the BBC over the years – was correct. Helen Boaden, the BBC's former Head of News, has admitted that the Corporation's 'deep liberal bias' prevented it from reporting immigration properly . As Professor Stone observed: 'If any honest statistician had made the same painstaking but assumption-based calculations, the last word he/she would have used to describe the estimates is “precise” – unless exhaustion had affected judgment. 'Most of the underlying crude assumptions that the all-embracing approach has been obliged to make have not been subject to sensitivity tests that might have been made if the study had not been so obviously driven to make the case it claims to have made.' Mr Williams, meanwhile, says the authors have deliberately overstated the benefits of EEA immigration – a particularly crucial finding, given the current debate over benefit tourism and the lifting of restrictions on 29million citizens of Romania and Bulgaria. The UCL report found that, over an 11-year period, EEA migrants had made a net contribution to the economy of £22billion. But Mr Williams said this conclusion was 'vulnerable' to even a small change in the assumptions used by the report's authors. Dr Frattini graduated from Bocconi University, Milan, and is currently assistant professor at the Department of Economics of the University of Milan. The central bus station in Sofia, Bulgaria where passengers will start travelling to Britain and European destinations . In 2003, ahead of Poland and seven other ex-Eastern Bloc countries joining the EU, Professor Dustmann was one of the authors of the notoriously inept Home Office study predicting that only between 5,000 and 13,000 migrants a year would come to the UK. In the end, more than one million arrived – the largest single wave of immigration to this country since 1066. Indeed, the research was so disastrous that, ahead of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens getting full rights to work this week, the current government refused to repeat the exercise. Is it unfair to suggest that, having so spectacularly underestimated the number of Eastern Europeans who would arrive in the UK post-2004, Professor Dustmann might feel inclined to 'spin' their positive impact? Certainly, if the BBC mentioned his central role in the flawed 2003 study, I must have missed it in the blanket coverage afforded to the more recent report in November. But then why would BBC chiefs be critical of a study which confirmed their own long-held views? There are many other reasons to question the UCL report. For instance, it made no attempt to distinguish between the types of contribution made by migrants from the Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004, and 'old' member states such as France and Germany. Highly skilled German engineers and French fashion designers and bankers were therefore lumped together with lower-paid migrants from Poland and elsewhere. Unsurprisingly, this produced a positive – if flawed – conclusion. Most egregiously, the UCL report appeared deliberately to downplay the conclusion that between 1995 and 2011 immigrants from outside the EEA claimed £100billion more in benefits than they paid in taxes. (This is, mostly, because they tended to have more children than native Britons.) In any case, focusing on the economic contribution made to the UK exchequer by migrants ignores other vital issues. People prepare to board a bus to London via Germany and Franceat the central bus station in Sofia . For example, much of the public's concern about mass immigration is based on how Britain's infrastructure and social fabric can cope with such a rapidly expanding population. Meanwhile, Helen Boaden, the BBC's former Head of News, has admitted that the Corporation's 'deep liberal bias' prevented it from reporting immigration properly or taking lobby groups critical of mass immigration seriously. It is true that it occasionally invites the respected former diplomat Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, to give a brief alternative view, during which he will be challenged ferociously by the same presenters who treat the pro-immigration lobby with kid gloves. As Dr David Green, director of Civitas, said yesterday: 'It is regrettable that even academics from an august institution like UCL can only see what they want to see. 'Yet again the BBC has failed in its duty to provide the public with impartial information. 'It has the resources to double-check conclusions based on statistical studies but instead seized on the conclusions to bolster its pre-existing prejudices.' But, having given the UCL's study such prominent coverage at the time, you'd think Radio 4's Today programme would find time to report the serious problems highlighted by Civitas and Professor Stone yesterday. Experience of BBC bias teaches us, however, that we should not hold our breath.","Findings of a UCL study given huge coverage across BBC .

"By . Philip Jacobson . UPDATED: . 01:24 EST, 19 October 2011 . Back in fatigues: Sergeant First Class Gilad Shalit, wearing army uniform at an IDF base . near Kerem Shalom, Israel, this morning, shortly after his release . As footage of the release of Israeli . soldier Gilad Shalit – pale and drawn after five years as a hostage of . Hamas – was beamed around the world yesterday, a Palestinian friend . called me from the main square in Gaza City. He said he was in the middle of a huge . and jubilant crowd waiting to welcome home the first of the 1,027 . prisoners for whom Shalit had been exchanged. The green battle flags of the Islamic . militant Palestinian group were flying everywhere, he added, before he . handed his phone to someone he described as a senior Hamas official. ‘This is just the beginning,’ the man . bellowed over the blare of celebratory music. ‘Now we must seize more . like Shalit, because without bargaining chips we’ll never get more of . our own heroes back.’ Half an hour later I spoke to a . veteran Israeli journalist in Jerusalem, who observed morosely that ‘the . market price for prisoner exchanges just went through the roof’. Never before have so many jailed . Palestinians been swapped for a single captive, he pointed out, and in . contrast to Israel’s previous refusal to release anyone with innocent . blood on their hands, those freed yesterday included men and women . convicted of atrocious attacks on ‘soft’ targets like hotels, pizza . parlours and discotheques. Yet while opponents of the deal for . Shalit point to the risk that it will encourage further abductions, . almost 80 per cent of Israelis questioned in a recent opinion poll said . they backed an exchange. That helps to explain why prime . minister Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu, normally so hard-line on terrorism, . felt he could agree to pay such a high price for the  25-year-old . conscript soldier. The vast majority of men, and a . significant number of women, in Israel are liable for up to two years’ military service. Israelis as a whole identify very closely with those . who risk their lives, and they expect the state to do everything in its . power to look after them. Scroll down for video .

He was whisked back into Gaza and has since been held incommunicado – . many believe in underground cells. A skilfully orchestrated campaign led . by his family and a growing army of supporters, some of whom camped in . tents for 15 months outside the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem, . piled the pressure on Netanyahu’s government to act. ‘Put it this way,’ said my journalist . friend. ‘Nothing could bring back the people killed by Hamas suicide . bombings but there was always a chance to save Gilad’s life and Bibi . obviously felt he could take the risk.’ Samer Tareq al-Issawi rides a horse with the Palestinian flag held aloft after he is released from an Israeli prison in Jerusalem .

Shalit is the first Israeli soldier to have been returned alive from captivity by an Arab state for over 25 years. He is said to have fainted on the . helicopter taking him home and an initial medical examination showed . signs of malnutrition and lack of exposure to the sun, officials said. Earlier, after being taken from Gaza . to Egypt still flanked by masked Hamas guards, Shalit told local TV he . had known of his pending release for a week, saying: ‘I always knew I . would go home.’ For Hamas, the exchange represents a spectacular, and much-needed, propaganda victory. The fundamentalist rulers of Gaza . have seen their popular support plummet in recent months as its bully . boys clamp down on ‘non-Islamic’ behaviour and the local economy . struggles with the impact of economic sanctions imposed by the West on . Hamas. Many ordinary Palestinians are also . weary of the organisation’s unwaveringly confrontational stance towards . the West, especially at a time when the more moderate Palestinian . Authority is campaigning diplomatically to gain a United Nations seat . for their country. Shalit's family and friends weep with joy outside the Prime Minister's residence in Jeruslaem . Flanked by security, these were the first pictures of Shalit (centre, in a baseball cap and grey shirt) on the day of his release . Until today, Shalit had not been seen since this video was released in October 2009 . In his first interview after being . released, Shalit said he hoped the prisoner exchange ‘would contribute . to peace between Israel and the Palestinians’. Yet the prospects of it . producing any meaningful breakthrough seem slight at best. One Western observer in Jerusalem . described the Shalit deal as ‘a kind of commercial transaction, arrived . at after endless haggling between two sides who don’t really trust each . other’. That is underlined by the small print, . under which the release of the second batch of prisoners will not occur . for another two months. An Israeli security source says: ‘The . Palestinians just released will be monitored very closely by our . intelligence agencies in case they get involved with extremist groups . again, and if that should happen, everything could be up in the air.’ Meanwhile the raw passions aroused . among Israeli opponents of the exchange are unlikely to fade, with . families of the victims of Hamas attacks reacting furiously. One man who lost his parents and three . children in a bombing ten years ago raged that Shalit’s father should . hang out a black flag for his son’s return ‘because for us this is a day . of mourning’.

Clay Aiken, the openly gay runner-up in the 2003 American Idol contest, is quietly exploring a run for Congress in his native North Carolina. And Republicans have already gone on the offensive. The Washington Blade, a gay community magazine in the nation's capital, reported Friday that the crooner has talked with pollsters and election consultants to learn whether he would stand a chance to unseat Rep. Renee Ellmers, the Republican who has represented the Raleigh, North Carolina district since 2011. Daniel Keylin, a spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, was unimpressed by Friday's news. 'In a testament to the weakness of the Democrat Party, Clay Aiken would actually be one of their strongest Congressional candidates if he runs,' Keylin told MailOnline. Political high notes? Clay Aiken is actively working toward a run for Congress, sources told the LGBT-oriented Washington Blade newspaper . Surgical nurse Renee Ellmers has represented North Carolina's Second Congressional District since 2011, and Clay Aiken reportedly wants her job . One of the Democratic operatives Aiken has met with is Betsy Conti, a veteran of Tarheel State politics who served under Governor Bev Purdue and worked on former Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore's campaign in 2000. Aiken lost the 2003 American Idol crown to 'velvet teddy bear' Ruben Studdard, the rotund gospel singer who made news in 2013 when he lost a reported 112 pounds on the show 'The Biggest Loser.' His career has spanned recording, publishing, theater and television, appearing as Sir Robin in the Broadway production of 'Spamalot!' and co-authoring a New York Times best-seller in 2004 and taking second place – behind former late-night host Arsenio Hall – in the 2012 edition of Donald Trump's show 'Celebrity Apprentice.' A run for Congress wouldn't represent the gay father's first toe-dip into politics. In July he made an appearance on Capitol Hill, urging lawmakers to get tougher on anti-gay bullying. 'I was picked on, I was called gay, I was called fag, I was called sissy, you name it,;' he said during a congressional briefing. 'Fortunately, I was able to overcome it and live through it because of a number of friends who were supportive of me.' Aiken lost the 2003 American Idol crown to crooner Ruben Studdard (L), but both have had successful recording careers . Aiken came out as gay shortly after his son was born, telling reporters that he didn't want to raise a child to hide the truth from anyone . In 2012 he told the Charlotte Observer that he harbored a secret desire to become North Carolina's governor. 'When I was in eighth grade, we had to do . a project where we interviewed somebody we admired and wrote a paper . about them,' he said. 'Everybody did a . parent or their youth pastor or someone close to them. I called [then-U.S. Senator] Terry Sanford’s office in Raleigh and went . and interviewed [him].' Aiken has not yet announced his candidacy. The deadline for running in the May 6 primary election is February 28. If he were to enter the race, he would face former North Carolina Commerce Secretary Keith Crisco, who has far more government experience but less name recognition.","The openly gay Aiken came in second in the 2003 American Idol and the 2012 Celebrity Apprentice shows .

"By . Matt Barlow . PUBLISHED: . 09:19 EST, 4 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 02:37 EST, 5 March 2014 . Welcome aboard: Dr Steve Peters . England manager Roy Hodgson has confirmed he will use a sports psychiatrist in the lead-up to the World Cup - naming Dr Steve Peters as the man who will help prepare his players for the challenges in Brazil. Peters, who has worked closely with Liverpool and has a long-standing relationship with England captain Steven Gerrard, will be involved with Hodgson's squad and the manager is pleased to have him on board. 'It is not just any psychiatrist,' he said. 'It is Dr Steve Peters, who is a very famous man in that area. 'He . has a great CV of working in different sports and has been doing some . work with Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers so Steve knows him well. 'It . is something we have spoken about for some time but we wanted to get . the right man - luckily Brendan let me talk to Steve and he has accepted . our invitations so we are happy with that.' Peters has also worked successfully with the Great Britain cycling team and five-time world snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan. Endorsement: Gerrard had one-on-one meetings with Peters when going through a groin injury . Desperate: Luke Shaw is keen to make an impression on Roy Hodgson . Neat touch: Wayne Rooney juggles the ball during the training session at Enfield on Monday . Best of enemies: Leighton Baines and Ashley Cole (right) are battling for England's left back place . Gerrard gave his ringing endorsement for Peters, and revealed he first met him three years ago. 'I've . been seeing him for three years now,' said Gerrard. 'First, when I had a . groin problem and feared for my career in 2010. I saw him in a . one-on-one situation and liked the work he did. I continued to see him . and I've seen more of him since he's been connected with Liverpool. 'He can’t help you do a Cruyff turn better but he can help you to learn what goes on in your head and help with preparation. 'I . didn’t know what was going on in my head before I worked with him. It . works. He’s helped me with mental prep before games. I feel I’ve found . my most consistent form since I’ve been seeing SP. I’m delighted the . manager’s got him on board.' Heads up: Jack Wilshere keeps his eye on the ball and will hope to get some game time against Denmark . Something old, something new: It's routine for Wayne Rooney but Luke Shaw is preparing for his England debut . Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge praised Dr Peters in an interview last October as he hit top form for his club. 'Steve had helped a lot in terms of mindset,' he told the Liverpool Echo. 'He's all about self-belief: don't go out there with the mentality of trying to do something, just let it happen.' Peters made Sturridge give himself a mark out of 10 for his Liverpool performances so far. The striker said: 'Steve told me to say high but I've never been one to be comfortable. I'm uncomfortable getting comfortable. 'I . think, for my capacity as a footballer, I'd sat a seven out of 10. Probably even six - I'm being kind to myself saying a seven. I can do a . lot better than I'm doing now.' Hodgson . also reacted to Kyle Walker's withdrawal from Wednesday's friendly at . home to Denmark and confirmed Glen Johnson is now set to earn his 50th . cap. 'It is unfortunate of course,' Hodgson said of Walker's hip injury. 'He . hasn't played for the last two or three games and we were hoping he . would recover but he needs at least another week before he will be fit . to play. 'He was with us last night, we had a 'Brazil' meeting to put our plans forward. 'There . aren't that many defenders so there is a good chance, if you insist I . tell you Glen Johnson will get his 50th cap at right-back then I can say . yes.' Gerrard is joined in . the England squad by Liverpool team-mates Johnson, Raheem Sterling, . Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson and the skipper wants to see their . club form relate into a good international showing if they are . selected. Still got it: Hodgson gets involved while on the pitch in Enfield . 'I think we have got five in the squad and everyone is in good form and feeling confident,' he said. 'If . everyone is selected hopefully they can bring their performances . tomorrow night. We are happy with where we are in the table. 'You . have got to give credit to Brendan Rogers - if you are good enough he . plays you. He is not scared and he has been paid back by them with . top-class performances.' Luke Shaw, meanwhile, knows he needs to make the most of his first England appearance to make the plane to Brazil. Shaw only made his league debut last year for Southampton, but he looks set to earn his first England cap on Wednesday night against Denmark. 'If you get a chance you have to give everything and try and impress the manager,' Shaw told The FA's website. 'Hopefully I can do it this week.' WHO IS STEVE PETERS?A consultant psychiatrist and university lecturer who works with elite sports teams and senior management for corporate industries.WHO HAS HE HELPED?Peters's clients include Team GB cyclists such as Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Chris Hoy, Ronnie O’Sullivan, Liverpool and England’s 2007 Rugby World Cup squad.WHAT ARE HIS METHODS?Peters works to a principle called ‘The Chimp Paradox’, which says the brain is split into three parts: the rational ‘human’ section, the illogical ‘chimp’ section and a computer for storing information. The way athletes control their ‘chimp’ dictates how well they perform. Put simply, athletes need to control their surges of emotion. HOW DOES IT WORK IN PRACTICE?Peters gets athletes to write down all the problems in their lives leading up to a big competition. For each problem they then have to provide a logical solution to help them deal with it. Peters also warns athletes against setting goals that are beyond their control. For example, footballers should not set a goal of becoming the best footballer in the world because they have no control over what other players will achieve. However, he will tell them to try and be the best they can possibly be and then devise a plan from there.

Rising star: Katie Leung, 25 has honed her craft at an acting course at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and is landing lead roles . In the week that JK Rowling was revealed to have written a crime thriller under a male pseudonym, a star of the Harry Potter films has told of her own secret: that she nearly quit showbusiness. Katie Leung – who found fame as the first girl to kiss Harry  Potter in the blockbuster films – admitted she suffered a massive crisis of confidence because she felt a fraud as an actress. She was a 16-year-old Scottish schoolgirl with no acting experience when she was picked from 3,000 hopefuls at an open casting for the role of Cho Chang in Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire in 2004. But . while her Hogwarts co-stars used the Potter franchise as a stepping . stone to greater things, Katie turned to photography, completing a . degree course at Edinburgh College of Art. However, after four years out of the limelight, the draw of showbusiness proved too strong. Now . 25, Katie is 12 months into a three-year acting course at the Royal . Conservatoire of Scotland and last week starred in the gritty Channel 4 . drama Run, which will be released on DVD tomorrow. She has also played the lead in the first stage adaptation of Jung Chang’s Wild Swans and has a number of other roles lined up. ‘I . will always be grateful for the opportunity the Harry Potter films gave . me. But I came away from them thinking that I didn’t feel like a real . actor,’ said Katie, who was a pupil at an independent school near her . home in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, when her father took her to London for . the Potter casting. ‘I felt a big part of what happened to me was based on luck. I did work very hard in the auditions and gave it my best shot. 'But I also wasn’t certain I wanted to rely on acting as a career because of the uncertainty of it. It has taken a while but now I feel more comfortable within myself. 'I’ve still got plenty to work on with my acting but with each role my confidence is growing.’ Katie paints a comical picture of her first day on a summer acting course at the Conservatoire. She said: ‘We had to say our name, where we came from and any acting experience we’d had, so I didn’t see the point in hiding anything. ‘So I said, “Hi, my name is Katie, I’m from Motherwell, and I’ve been in the Harry Potter movies.” At that point someone shouted, “I knew it! I thought you looked familiar!” It was one of those hilarious moments.’ Bright young things: Katie Leung (right) joined the Harry Potter cast and acted with Daniel Radcliffe (centre) and Emma Watson (left) at the age of 16 . Magical: Katie Leung (pictured with Harry Potter co-star Robert Pattinson) said she is grateful for her big break but spent four years leading a normal life out of the limelight . It is the sort of modesty which would chime with author Ms Rowling – who was last week unmasked as the author of The Cuckoo’s Calling, under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. That short course and the unstinting encouragement of Katie’s tutor persuaded her she might just have what it took to be an actor after all. Shortly afterwards, she landed the part of a lifetime – as Jung Chang in Wild Swans. The story is Chang’s bestselling account of the lives of three generations of Chinese women – and it had a profound effect on Katie, whose divorced parents are of Chinese descent. She said: ‘It’s probably the moment I decided I really did want to be an actor. Being on stage and having the immediate response from the audience made me feel really good about what I was doing. 'To see how it affected people, and for people to say they enjoyed it, really made it special.’ Her mother, Kar Wai Li, flew from Hong Kong to see her daughter tread the boards. She has lived in the former British colony since her marriage ended when Katie was three. Katie’s father, Peter, a millionaire who runs a restaurant and food wholesale business in Glasgow, raised Katie and her brother, Jonathan, who is a year younger. The Potter role – and that first kiss for Harry – led to jealous comments on the internet although Katie says she wasn’t ‘bothered too much by any of it’. Close: Katie aged three with her father, Peter. She was raised by her father, a millionaire who runs a restaurant and food wholesale business in Glasgow . All grown up: Katie starred as Ying in TV series Run. The gruelling role tested her acting abilities as she plays an illegal immigrant who is raped . Katie’s latest role was in Run, which concluded last Thursday. Set on the streets of Brixton, South London, she played an illegal immigrant, and the role was a tough one as it involved her being raped. By her side throughout the past few years has been her boyfriend, recruitment consultant Eric Caira, a close friend of her brother Jonathan. She and Eric first started chatting online as they played games of Call Of Duty. She said: ‘We have different personalities – that’s why it works. And if I have confidence issues, he’s always been there for me.’ Katie has just spent two weeks in the Cotswolds filming an episode for the BBC’s Father Brown crime drama series. She admits that thanks to Eric she has become something of a gaming addict. And after filming, the first thing she did when she returned to the new home she shares with Eric was switch on the PS3 games console – and crack open a beer! Disarmingly, she said: ‘That’s what I really like to do more than anything. I find killing zombies and games like Call Of Duty really  therapeutic. If I could be a bloke and do things like that all the time, I’d be in heaven.’ Role of a lifetime: The 25-year-old bagged the lead part in the Young Vic's production of Wild Swans last year . Her next role means she will miss a month of drama school to play the lead in The World Of Extreme Happiness at the National Theatre, in London. Rehearsals for her part as Sunny – a girl who leaves her family in rural China for the promise of a job in a factory and a new life – begin in a few weeks. The play is due to begin its month-long run on September 25. She admitted: ‘I’m over the moon but scared too. I hope I can do the part justice.’ With several serious roles under her belt, Katie has confessed she no longer feels like a ‘fraud’. She said: ‘Harry Potter was so huge, it took me a few years to get to the point where I realised I would rather die than sit in an office nine to five. 'But the indecision has gone and now I’m committed to acting.’ It is clear Katie is determined to make up for lost time.","Katie Leung, 25 was picked from 3,000 hopefuls in open casting Harry Potter film .

"By . Jamie Carragher . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 24 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:18 EST, 25 January 2014 . Welcome to modern football, the Glazer family. Welcome to the game everyone else plays — are you ready for what lies ahead? Manchester United’s owners have had it easy since they arrived here in 2005. They relied upon the genius of Sir Alex Ferguson to keep producing teams who enabled them to stay at the top. Their ownership has resulted in five Premier League titles, three League Cups and a Champions League but those trophies had nothing to do with bold statements in the transfer market. They were down to the inspiration of Ferguson. Success: Sir Alex Ferguson ensured a continuous flow of trophies despite Man Utd's relatively modest net spend . History: Now Sir Alex Ferguson has retired, Man United are going to have spend more to be competitive . Now, with United facing a  huge fight to get into the top four, they need a new approach. They need to show they are prepared to spend. The clubs who stay at the head of the game invest in the future from positions of strength, which is why the signing of Juan Mata is intriguing. Is this a pointer to the future or simply a break from the norm? Do not think for one moment the £37million paid for Mata will cure all United’s ills. To get back to where they were under Ferguson, dominating domestically and constantly posing a threat in Europe, they need another three or four of those transfers. Goodbyes: Man United need to spend more money than the £37million Juan Mata they will pay Chelsea for Juan Mata . New challenge: Juan Mata will be hoping to spend more time on the pitch for Man Utd than he did at Chelsea . United have never been afraid of spending but since the last time they broke their transfer record — for Dimitar Berbatov (£30.75m) in 2008, four months after they won the Champions League in Moscow — their rivals have been bold. The Glazers, by contrast, have been complacent and the evidence across Europe stacks up against them — none of the clubs they want to compete with have hesitated when it comes to paying massive fees. Real Madrid have gone beyond £80m twice since 2009; last summer Barcelona paid £51m for Neymar; Paris Saint-Germain went higher to get Edinson Cavani, as did Monaco when they landed Radamel Falcao. Record: Real Madrid were prepared to spend £86 on Gareth Bale last summer, a world-record fee . Previous highest fee: Dimitar Berbatov held the record for the biggest Man Utd transfer fee, at £30.75m, before Mata . Quality does not come cheaply and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge explained to me in December the moment Bayern Munich realised they would be fighting an uphill battle if they didn’t follow the lead of others and spend big. It revolved around the Spain midfielder Javi Martinez. Bayern were debating spending €40m, but ultimately the question came down to, ‘Would he make a difference?’ The answer was ‘Yes’ and Martinez ended up playing a key role in Bayern winning the Treble. Other than Robin van Persie, how many players capable of making a difference have United bought since Cristiano Ronaldo left in 2009? In that time, their net spend has been £68m, dwarfed by the likes of Real Madrid (£307m), Chelsea (£306m) and Manchester City (£367). Even Stoke (£72.5m) have spent more. Mata will make a difference to United. If he produces the numbers he did for Chelsea — he has been directly involved in 45 goals (scored 18, assisted 27) since 2011 — then they have a chance of pegging back Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton in the race for the top four. His arrival will also lift a squad who are on their knees following the latest setback against Sunderland; nothing beats seeing a quality addition walk into the dressing room and David Moyes will hope Mata can do for his squad what Eric Cantona did for Ferguson in 1992 — add quality and galvanise those around him. But the men who hold the key to United’s future are the Glazers. Are they going to stand up to the challenges of modern football, or are they going to coast along without any real spending? If they choose the latter option, this season is unlikely to prove a one-off. Made the difference: Bayern Munich spent 40m Euros on Javi Martinez (centre) who helped win the Treble . ................................................................................................................................. Thrills at the top, chills at the bottom . The most exciting Premier League season of recent years has had the unusual impact of removing a word we use frequently from our conversations — mid-table. Think about it: the League is so open that practically every club in the top flight has something to play for with 16 games left and nobody is just drifting along. Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea are fighting to be champions; the four teams below them are involved in a tremendous scrap to secure the final Champions League place, while eighth-placed  Newcastle will feel they can still qualify for the Europa League. Table toppers: Arsenal currently lead the way in the Premier League, one point ahead of Man City . Threat: Cardiff, scoring here against Man City, may be bottom of the table, but can still trouble the top teams . Aston Villa are 10th with 24 points, but given that bottom club Cardiff have 18, not one team in that pack will be able to relax, with the fear of relegation haunting them. That just leaves Southampton, who are ninth with 31 points, looking isolated. Of course, the situation will change over the coming weeks but as we look  forward to another round of matches in midweek, it is brilliant to see such interest being generated. You only have to think back to this stage 12 months ago when everyone knew Queens Park Rangers and Reading were going down and Manchester United effectively had the title sewn up. What we have now is what football should be all about. .................................................................................................................................No excuses if Sunderland drop . Sunderland fully deserve their first trip to Wembley since 1992 and they should enjoy every minute of the Capital One Cup final. In no way, though, should their progress in this competition be used as an excuse for the position they currently occupy in the Premier League table — and if they end up being relegated in May, they should not compare themselves to either Birmingham or Wigan. Birmingham, of course, went down in 2011 after dramatically winning the League Cup. But when they beat Arsenal at Wembley, they had two games in hand on their relegation rivals and were just one win away from going 10th in the table. Ecstasy: The Sunderland players celebrate after their League Cup penalty shootout joy against Man Utd . No excuses: Given some of the results Sunderland have had this season, they should beat the drop . Complacency — they took just nine points from the final 12 games — led to Birmingham’s season unravelling. Wigan’s situation was different as all their high-pressure games came at the end of last season and it eventually it became emotionally and physically draining; remember, they played in the FA Cup final four days before they had to go to Arsenal and win to stand any chance of surviving. Sunderland, by contrast, will have plenty of time after the March 2 final to try to save their top-flight status. A team who have beaten Manchester City and Everton in the Premier League, and knocked Manchester United and Chelsea out of the Capital One Cup, clearly have the talent to stay up.If they fail to do that, they will only have themselves to blame because they shouldn’t have any other distraction. My top five... FA Cup potential shocks . The fourth-round draw might be lacking a blockbuster tie but that does not mean the FA Cup will be a breeze this weekend for the Premier League sides in action. If anything, the opposite will be true as plenty of teams in the lower divisions will be out to make a statement. 1 BIRMINGHAM v SWANSEA . It has been alarming to see Swansea’s . form tail off so badly and Michael Laudrup will see this fixture as a . chance to restore some confidence. Birmingham City, though, will have . other ideas and will be looking for Lee Novak to get into dangerous . areas. Banana skin: Birmingham will be looking for Lee Novak to get into dangerous areas against inconsistent Swansea . 2 BOLTON v CARDIFF . Cardiff sprang a surprise at Newcastle . in the last round but their form since has been poor and Bolton, in . need of a lift after being thrashed 7-1 at Reading, could upset them. Mark Davies, back last month from a cruciate injury, can dictate in the Bolton midfield. Orchestrator: Mark Davies can dictate Bolton's midfield against Cardiff after returning from injury . 3 SOUTHEND v HULL . Roots Hall is a compact little . stadium, the type you associate with giant-killings, and this tie has . the ingredients for another — not least as Southend manager Phil Brown . is taking on his old club. Hull will have to keep an eye on Southend’s leading scorer, Kevan Hurst. Danger man: Southend's leading scorer Kevan Hurst (centre) will be one for Hull to look out for . 4 WIGAN v CRYSTAL PALACE . The holders survived a scare against MK Dons and now they will be aiming to create a shock of their own. Crystal Palace have done well since Tony Pulis took over but it will be difficult for them at the DW. Where Eagles dare: FA Cup holders Wigan survived a scare against MK Dons but could cause Crystal palace problems . 5 SHEFF UTD v FULHAM . After dumping Aston Villa out in the . last round, Sheffield United under Nigel Clough will fancy their chances . of making the last 16, especially with home advantage. Fulham are vulnerable with relegation fears on their mind. Bigger things: With relegation on their mind, Fulham could take their eye off the ball against Sheffield United .","Man United will need to buy more players of £37m Juan Mata's calibre if they're to challenge at the top .

Its stock in trade is cut-and-blow-drys rather than Jamaican ginger cake, mops and pineapple chunks. But now the net-curtained Beautique hair salon is ready for a makeover of its own - to turn it back into the setting for stammering, skinflint Arkwright’s corner shop. With Open All Hours about to return to our screens after nearly 30 years for a Christmas special, the end-of-terrace shop is once again to be the setting for the late Ronnie Barker’s grocery store. The salon in the Doncaster suburb of Balby, South Yorkshire, was used as the exterior of the overcrowded, old-fashioned grocery store run by Arkwright and his put-upon assistant Granville, played by Sir David Jason, in the original hit series. Scroll down for video . The way we were: Helen . Ibbotson with Ronnie Barker and . David Jason outside Arkwright's grocery store in the classic TV comedy Open All Hours which is set to return this year for a Christmas special . Helen Ibbotson with her daughter Lisa Taylor. Helen used to own the Beautique salon where exterior shots for Open All Hours were filmed . Front: The Hair Salon in Balby, South Yorkshire which was used as the exterior of the grocery in the classic comedy - and will be again . Yesterday Helen Ibbotson, 82, who started the hair salon in 1962, said she believed the show’s makers chose her shop back then because its writer Roy Clark’s father used to have a corner shop and Roy was local to the area. For the series that ran from 1976 to 1985 watched by 17million viewers a week, producers fitted a fake shop sign, stacked tins in the windows and piled vegetables and cooking pots on tables outside as they transformed Beautique into Arkwright’s. It was there, at the end of each episode, that Arkwright would reflect on the events of the day as he packed his wares away. Ironically, before Mrs Ibbotson began her business the shop had actually been a greengrocer - and when she took it over her late husband had to remove lots of tinned goods from the cellar. After she retired aged 67, she passed the shop on to her daughter Lisa Taylor, a hairdresser, who has run it ever since, although the salon now only opens twice a week. Yesterday mother of two Mrs Taylor said ‘a man from the BBC’ came to the shop last Thursday with regard to filming the one-off Christmas special there and told her it was ‘all a bit top secret as they hadn’t been given the go ahead yet’. ‘Then he rang me last night and said it’s going ahead.

Recalling how the salon was first chosen back in the 1970s, Mrs Ibbotson said: ‘The producer rang me and asked ‘could we borrow your shop?’ and I said ‘you’re joking aren’t you?’, but he said he wasn’t. ‘He came and met us at the shop and then the rest is history really. I’d like to see another episode filmed, it was good.’ She can also clearly remember mingling with stars Jason and Barker when they were on set. ‘I think they came about four of five times, they came once and they were in for three weeks,’ she said. ‘They would come at three weeks at a time and they would pay us to use the shop. ‘At one time I was that busy they rented me another shop to do the hairdressing in, just up the road.’ In 2006, the shop was threatened with demolition after council chiefs warned that pre-1919 housing may have to be demolished in a regeneration drive.

In it, Sir David Jason will once again play Granville, but this time he is in charge after Arkwright has died and passed the son on to his nephew in his will. Last night a BBC source said: ‘It’s still early stages and we’re still planning exactly when and where filming will take place.’ Meanwhile, a corner shop thought to have inspired the classic TV sitcom Open All Hours has long since closed and been turned into a family home. Meecham & Sons, which was run by Brian Meecham in Crewkerne, Somerset, shut for the last time in 1998 after 70 years. It was run by his father George before him. Before his death aged 78 last year, Brian Meecham revealed that Barker was a frequent customer when the comedian had a holiday cottage six miles away at Beaminster. ‘I recall him coming to the shop for boiled sweets - bull’s eyes, if I remember rightly. No one realised he was taking away the inspiration for a series as well,’ he said. Yesterday his daughter Debra Spurway said: ‘Ronnie Barker famously said that he took inspiration from everywhere he went and everything he saw so it is entirely possible Dad and his shop were an inspiration.’","Helen Ibbotson, 82, confirmed the BBC had called about once again using salon to shoot new episodes of iconic show .

An eerie song that helped children on a Titanic lifeboat block out the cries of the dying can be heard once again. The song came from a musical toy pig that belonged to Edith Rosenbaum, an American fashion journalist, who was 32 at the time of the tragedy. Rosenbaum and her pig survived the sinking in April 1912, but unfortunately the mechanism that played the music didn’t. Now the National Maritime Museum has fixed the musical toy and made a recording of the song . 101 years after the event. Scroll down for video . The musical pig belonged to Edith Rosenbaum, an American fashion journalist, who was 32 at the time of the tragedy. Rosenbaum and her pig survived the sinking in April 1912 . 'It was one of those goosebump moments,' Rory McEvoy, a curator at the museum, told MailOnline about the tune. 'We never expected it would have been possible. It was tremendously exciting and eerie at the same time.' Researchers only played the song a few times to prevent further damage to the toy, and made the recording in the hope that the public could identify the tune. In a 1970 interview, Ms Rosenbaum described how she refused to evacuate the Titanic at first, and it was her musical pig that saved her. ‘I never would have left the ship,’ she said, ‘but a sailor came along and he said: “say you;  you don’t want . to be saved, well I’ll save your baby” and he grabbed this pig from . under my arm and he tossed it in the lifeboat.’ Ms . Rosenbaum followed the pig into the lifeboat and, during the seven . hours before being rescued, comforted children on board with the tune.

As the pig could not be opened without causing irreparable damage, the team at the National Maritime Museum used high resolution X-ray equipment to examine the internal components. The toy was scanned twice; the first to pick out the details of the main body and a second to obtain good images of the musical movement. They found that pig’s body was constructed from organic material, wood and papier maché. Mr McEvoy explained that to scan the movement, the lower energy radiation had to be filtered out by placing a small copper sheet in the path of the X-rays before they met the object.

The scan revealed the tail was a knotted piece of vellum that was never connected to the music box. Initially, the team thought the music was spring-driven and activated by pulling the tail. But the scans showed it was actually a hand-powered type of movement. ‘By slicing across the width of the model the cause of a rattling noise was identified as a hairpin, probably used in attempt to reconnect to the music box after the crank had broken away,’ said Mr McEvoy, in his blog. ‘The S-shaped object in the centre appears to be the original crank-handle and tail. ‘Detailed examination of this object shows it to be a skin-covered metal tube, which is an unexpected and very exciting find, perhaps a case for key-hole surgery,’ added Mr McEvoy. As the pig could not be opened without causing irreparable damage, the team at the National Maritime Museum used high resolution X-ray equipment to examine the internal components . The second scan showed a toothed wheel attached to the pin barrel, which was driven by a worm gear on the end of the crank shaft. The comb was marked with a distinctive star logo, which the team are now hoping will help them identify the maker. ‘What has been shown here is only the beginning of the study; these 3-D models provide invaluable information that will assist with our curatorial questions as well as the long-term care and conservation of these extraordinary objects,’ said Mr McEvoy. The pig came to the Museum as part of the Lord-MacQuitty collection in 2003.","The toy belonged to Edith Rosenbaum, an American fashion journalist .

Australian airline Qantas has removed pork from its in-flight menu on routes to and from Europe after going into partnership with Middle Eastern airline Emirates. No food containing pork or pork products will be served on the European flights - which now have a stopover in Dubai - because pork is considered 'unholy' and therefore strictly forbidden by Islam. All meals offered on the route in first, business and economy classes will also be prepared without alcohol in keeping with the Islamic religion. Pork sausages are now banned from Qantas flights through Europe after a merger with Emirates . The Qantas pork ban comes as other . airlines - in the wake of the Qantas-Emirates merger - jostle for market . share by aggressively discounting fares from Australia to Europe. A note on the Qantas menus on flights in and out of Dubai states that the meals do not contain pork products or alcohol. The airline has also introduced a mezze plate, offering traditional Middle Eastern fare in its upper classes, and has Arabic translations after in-flight announcements. A Qantas spokesman said the decision to remove pork, ham and other related food items had had minimal impact on its menu, and said it was still offering the same meal choices. 'Qantas in-flight catering often reflects the cultural and regional influences of the international destinations we fly to,' he said. 'On flights to and from Hong Kong and China, our menus include regionally inspired dishes such as stir fries and to Singapore we have noodle options.' Meals on Qantas flights in and out of Dubai, above, no longer contain pork products or any alcohol . Qantas also offers meals without pork and alcohol on flights to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, which also has a large Muslim population. Several other airlines which fly from Australia to the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia do not serve pork either. Virgin Australia does not serve pork on flights to and from Abu Dhabi and all meals that are prepared are halal accredited, with meat prepared in a way prescribed by Islamic law. Qantas passengers heading to any European city now fly via Dubai instead of Singapore, as they did under the airline's previous longstanding partnership with British Airways.","Australian airline changed menu after doing deal with Middle Eastern airline .

Pupils at one of the UK's top colleges re-enacted the grim trenches of the Somme in a dramatic Remembrance Day memorial event yesterday. To honour the 707 former Wellington College pupils killed in the First World War - including Rudyard Kipling's son Jack and poet Jack Girling - the same number of students lay motionless on the ground in the independent school's front quadrangle. Students at the Â£10,500-a-term school in Crowthorne, Berkshire, commemorated the lives of the hundreds of alumni who died on the bloody battlefields of the Great War. Poignant: A total of 707 pupils at Wellington College, the same amount of alumni that died in The Great War, lay prone to remember their sacrifice . Silence fell as the youngsters, girls and boys aged between 13 and 18 years, passed into the quad in front of the school, established in 1859 and named after the Duke of Wellington, which houses a memorial and roll call of former pupils from the Berkshire college, killed during military service. The school's chaplain, Father Tim Novis, led a prayer before a reading of AE Housman's poem Here Dead We Lie by college head boy and girl, Harry Randall and India Ayles. Including the 501 Old Wellingtonians who were killed in the Second World War and dozens more in conflicts since, the school has lost 1,340 ex-students on the battlefield.

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 20:33 EST, 29 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:33 EST, 29 December 2013 . In his New Year message ed Miliband has signaled that Labour may put free tax-payer funded childcare at the heart of its election manifesto . Labour is to put taxpayer-funded free childcare at the heart of the party’s general election campaign, Ed Miliband signals today. The Labour leader says he will make childcare a key plank of Labour’s attack on the cost of living in 2014, building on his pledge to freeze energy bills and crack down on pay day lenders. In his New Year message, released as an online video today, Mr Miliband warns that Britain is in the grip of ‘biggest cost-of-living crisis in a generation’. Labour sources have already revealed that the party is contemplating a ‘big offer’ on childcare as a centrepiece of the party’s election manifesto, which would see taxpayers fund state childcare for all pre-school children. Those on low incomes would get free childcare while the better off would initially receive subsidised low-cost childcare places. The party might decide to make universal provision a long-term goal. Mr Miliband says today: ‘We are in the midst of the biggest cost-of-living crisis in a generation. ‘People do not want the earth. They would much prefer some very specific promises, specific things about what a government will do - whether it’s freezing energy bills, taking action on pay day lenders, or tackling issues around childcare which lots of working parents face. ‘All of this is adding up to a programme for how we can change things.’ A Miliband aide said yesterday: ‘The cost of living crisis concerns jobs, wages and prices and childcare touches on all three of those things. ‘Greater availability of childcare ensures that it pays people to work. A huge number of women say that they can’t afford to go back to work because of childcare costs.’ Labour has been emboldened by a report earlier this month by the Institute for Public Policy Research which calculated that attracting 280,000 people back into the labour market would save almost £1.5bn in extra tax revenue and lower spending on benefits and tax credits. Jon Cruddas, the MP who is leading Labour’s policy review, has said the party is considering paying fathers to go to antenatal classes and hospital appointments with their expectant partners. Miliband says that offering the service will stimulate the economy by getting more parents back to work . In a recent speech to the Civitas think tank he said he was ‘looking at paid leave for prospective fathers to attend antenatal sessions and hospital appointments during pregnancy’. Labour has also promised to increase the 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds introduced by the Coalition to 25 hours. In a pitch for votes in marginal constituencies, Mr Miliband says: ‘Every morning I get up I’m going to be thinking about you, about how I can make your life better, your life easier - no easy answers - not an easy life - but how do we tip the balance towards hope and away from the struggles that you are facing.’ In an attack on the Tories, who say that they have a ‘long-term plan’ to put the economy back on track, Mr Miliband today insists that his pledges to ease the cost of living are not just gimmicks but also represent a coherent plan which will boost national economic strength over the next few years. He says: ‘People are thinking they have made the sacrifices - and the Government keeps telling them that everything is fixed. But it does not seem fixed to them.’ ‘The Tories want to change the conversation from the cost of living crisis. They will talk about anything else. ‘We are going to show to people in 2014 how by standing up for the right people...we can earn and grow our way to a higher standard of living for people.’ He adds: ‘It matters so much now for people who cannot afford to pay their gas bill or do the weekly shop. 'And it matters so much for the future too because so many people are thinking what future is there in this country for kids, my son or daughter, my niece or nephew, how are we going to make a difference for them?’","Ed Miliband signals election policy in New Year message .

Yet there still remained time for chivalry among the First World War flying aces. When a British plane was shot down in 1916 the German pilot followed the stricken aircraft and landed nearby to check the two-man crew had survived. He then braved French and British fire to cross enemy lines and drop a letter to Allied forces telling them the pair were alive. Blast! Oswald Boelke takes a picture of Formilli's crashed aircraft in January 1916 after shooting it down . Sorry about that, old bean: The amazing tale of chivalry in the air in the First World War shows just how gentlemanly combatants were, even in the grim battle . Chivalry: German Ace Oswald Boelke risked his life to deliver the letter of the man he shot down . The astonishing tale of gentlemanly . conduct in the heat of battle emerged yesterday when the letter and . photographs of the incident were put up for auction. It was on January 5, 1916, that the . British single-engine biplane, crewed by pilot Lieutenant William . Somervill and observer Lieutenant Geoffrey Formilli, took off on a . reconnaissance flight from Lille. Unfortunately, they encountered . legendary flier Oswald Boelcke – known as the father of the German . fighter air force and the aviator who trained the Red Baron, Manfred von . Richthofen – roaming the skies in his Fokker E IV fighter. Boelcke sprayed the British plane, a . BE2c reconnaissance aircraft, with hundreds of rounds from his . machine-guns, forcing it to crash land. The German ace wrote about what . happened when he landed and approached his two enemy airmen. ‘I went . straight up to the Englishmen, shook hands with them and told them I was . delighted to have brought them down alive,’ he wrote. ‘I had a long talk with the pilot, who spoke German well. When he heard my name he said with a grin, “We all know about you!” ‘I then saw to it that they were both . taken in a car to the hospital where I visited the observer today and . brought him some English papers and photos of his wrecked machine.’ Lieutenant Formilli then wrote a . letter to a Captain Babington of the Royal Flying Corps that Boelcke . dropped over the British lines. The letter said: ‘Just a line to say . that Somervill & I are alright. We had a scrap with a Fokker. Willy . got a graze on the side of his head & I got one through the shoulder . half way through. ‘We had most of our controls shot . through & had to land & crashed very badly. 'I am in Hospital now . & Willy is in Germany. Will you let my people know please, yours G . Formilli. PS. It was Boelcke who brought us down.’ The letter was later forwarded to Formilli’s mother by a soldier, C F Murphy, who watched it being dropped by the German pilot. Dropping a line: The chivalrous German visited the British observer Lt Geoffrey Formilli in hospital, and then incredibly undertook a perilous mission to drop a note from Formilli over his Squadron's HQ to let them know he was alive . Good news: The auction also contains the letter from Formilli's grateful Squadron commander to his parents confirming his survival . He wrote: ‘The German machine very . sportingly held on through heavy shell fire from us and the French and . was chased by several of our machines and had to run a hot gauntlet on . its errand but it escaped all right. ‘The news has given us all great pleasure and I rejoice to be able to send it to you.’ The archive of letters and several . photos taken by Boelcke – who downed 40 enemy planes before dying, aged . 25, after a mid-air collision with another German plane later in 1916 – . is being sold by Formilli’s family through Mullock’s of Ludlow, .

The German underwent further medical assessment at the Gunners’ training ground on Wednesday and has been diagnosed with a grade two hamstring strain. Sportsmail understands that Ozil is expected to be sidelined for between four and six weeks, ruling him of Arsenal’s league fixtures over the next month against Tottenham, Chelsea, Swansea City, Manchester City and Everton. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger defend Mesut Ozil's recent performances . Benched: Mesut Ozil was substituted at half-time against Bayern Munich in the Champions League clash . Out of sorts: Ozil was underwhelming in the first half at the Allianz Arena . Arsene Wenger predicted on Tuesday night that the playmaker would be out for 'at least a few weeks' and said he would know more after further tests on Wednesday. With the manager's fears now realised, Arsenal's record signing faces an uphill battle to be fit for the club's FA Cup semi-final clash with Wigan Athletic on April 12 as they attempt to end their nine-year trophy drought. The worst-case scenario is that he will also miss the April league matches against Hull City and Newcastle United, and will not return until early May. Ozil is believed to have injured his hamstring in the opening 10 minutes of the second-leg, last-16 clash at the Allianz Arena but carried on playing until half-time and aggravated the problem. He was checked by Arsenal’s medical team during the break and also saw Bayern’s Germany team doctor Hans Muller Wohlfahrt. No chance: Bastian Schweinsteiger opened the scoring for Bayern with a neat finish . Game on: But Lukas Podolski's equaliser had little bearing on the overall result . Speaking about Ozil in the immediate after of the Gunners’ Champions League exit, Wenger said: 'He has a hamstring injury that looks quite serious. I don’t know how long he will be out. For sure, he is out of Spurs. 'We have to make a scan tomorrow (Wednesday) to see how bad it is but he is out at least for a few weeks. I hope it’s not too bad.' Blow: Arsene Wenger could be without Ozil for six weeks . Ozil's setback is the latest in a series of serious injuries to senior members of Wenger's squad.

Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. In this week's column, why controversial Stan Collymore was right to make a stand over Twitter abuse, young Chelsea striker Patrick Bamford will thrive on loan at Derby and David Moyes will be given time to rebuild at Man United. CONTROVERSIAL COLLYMORE . There is no doubt, in days gone by, that Stan Collymore has got himself into some very tricky situations. However, I believe he is a fantastic broadcaster – very knowledgeable, well-researched, at times controversial yet eloquent – and nobody deserves the abuse that he has received on Twitter. Taking a stand: Stan Collymore suspended his Twitter account during the week in protest at abuse . I also don’t feel it gives people the right to have a go at him just because of his past. I used to be on Twitter until one night, sat at the front of the Notts County team bus on the way home from a win at Tranmere Rovers, a few of their supporters – and it was only a few – started giving me dog’s abuse. ‘Sign up here to the party when Allen dies,’ one said. ‘Let’s hope he gets cancer,’ another added. And there were a couple of others of that nature. Abuse: Collymore spoke out after receiving a torrent of abuse on the social networking site . Demand for action: Collymore said Twitter should do more to block offensive messages . I finally arrived back, absolutely seething and wanting to drive back up to Liverpool to find them. I awoke the next morning and cancelled my account, relieved to be free of the hassle and the stress it caused. Twitter can be fun, and I hope Stan doesn’t stop getting behind the keyboard with his controversial and strong views. If it wasn’t for people like him life would be boring. THE BIGGEST SIGNING OF THE TRANSFER WINDOW? The best piece of business in the transfer window so far involves a Chelsea player  –  but forget Juan Mata. Derby County have signed 20-year-old centre-forward Patrick Bamford on loan from the Blues. Big future: Patrick Bamford celebrates scoring for Derby County at Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. The young striker is on loan from Chelsea . Watch out for this young man. With his pace, body frame and finishing he reminds me of a young Fernando Torres. He’s done a fantastic job at MK Dons in League One in the first half of this season, scoring 17 goals in 30 games. Top form: After scoring 17 goals in 30 matches for Milton Keynes Dons in his previous loan spell, Bamford has started with two in three games for Derby . And Bamford has already scored twice in three games, coming off the bench for Steve McClaren. They say promotion to the Premier League is worth £120million. If Bamford starts firing this master swoop from McClaren could be worth a fortune. MOYES BACKED NO MATA WHAT . It’s heartening to read that Sir Alex Ferguson has assured David Moyes that his job is safe at Manchester United and that he will be the man to rebuild the club. After the League Cup semi-final defeat to Sunderland he would have been looking over his shoulder, worrying and wondering. And with constant speculation in the media and on social networks about his future, he would not have slept and will be feeling very uncomfortable. Backing: David Moyes will be given time to mould Manchester United in his own image, according to his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson . On top of the strains and stresses of recent results, he’s been pictured flying all over Europe looking to find players that will make a difference. Their squad is nowhere near the standards we have seen at Manchester United over recent years and is poor in comparison to Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal. Fightback: Moyes was delighted to welcome Juan Mata into his squad after signing him for £37million from Chelsea last week . Signing Mata would definitely not have been his priority, when they already had the attacking options of Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie combined with Adnan Januzaj and Danny Welbeck. It is a very handy forward line with many different options. But the spine of his team desperately needs two centre-backs and two central midfield players and a clear-out of the old school who are walking around saying ‘we didn’t used to do this’ or ‘we didn’t used to do that’ in training. NOTHING SURPRISES ME IN THIS MAD WORLD OF FOOTBALL… . Everton’s Bryan Oviedo breaking two bones in his leg against Stevenage brings back some horrible memories for me. One of my former MK Dons players Paul Mitchell – who was a dedicated, hard-working, conscientious central midfielder – was involved in a fairly innocuous tackle, 10 yards in front of my technical area, playing at Notts County back in 2007. Horrific: Phil Jagielka holds the leg of Bryan Oviedo after he sustained two broken bones in his leg during the FA Cup fourth round tie with Stevenage Borough on Saturday . It was clear instantly, as his leg dangled from his knee down like a piece of wet spaghetti, that Mitch had a serious problem. It’s a horrible feeling as a manager when one of your players suffers a bad injury. I remember sitting there, not bothered about the score or the rest of the game. I felt sick and just wanted to leave. When I finally got to the hospital in Nottingham at half-past-six a top orthopaedic surgeon had been called specially, such was the damage. Long lay-off: Oviedo was carried off on a stretcher  and ruled out until the end of the season . He looked at the results of the x-ray, spoke to Mitch then called me aside. He informed me the impact of the injury, from the bottom of his heel, through his ankle and into his shin, was very similar to the head-on car crash victims he usually deals with. Mitch was only 27, but he would never play again. I gave him the job of scouting our opposition and analysing our own team performances at MK Dons. Soon after I left to go to Leicester he was appointed chief scout before being head-hunted at Southampton where he is now head of recruitment.

Comeback is on: But Oxford mounted a fightback to 2-3, with Josh Ashby (centre) converting a penalty for the first . At 3-0 up, it looked like a straightforward evening for Premier League Cardiff against my nephew’s League Two side. Oxford . looked well and truly out of it. But then, they scored twice and . suddenly hysterical parents were screaming and shouting from the . terraces urging their sons on.

Marks & Spencer join Burberry, Tom Ford and Alexander McQueen today as they present their first designer menswear range on the catwalk at London Collections: Men. Their Best of British AW14 collection preview show, held at the Hospital Club in London, marks a shift for the High Street retailer, who are hoping to rival Savile Row with their sophisticated range. After a Christmas slump, M&S have suffered nine straight quarters of declining sales in clothing and homeware, so much rides on their foray into luxury menswear. British swagger: 'These are classic pieces mixed in a more contemporary way' Inspired by M&S's rich heritage, the Best of British range celebrates the best in British design and manufacture. Tony O'Connor, head of menswear design, said he has drawn inspiration from stylish British icons such as the late Sir David Frost and former 007 Sir Roger Moore. He has updated their 1970s looks for the modern M&S gent. 'These are classic pieces mixed in a more contemporary way,' he tells the Sunday Times. He says his Best of British catwalk collection is full of 'that British-style swagger and suaveness. I wouldn't say it's a dandification, because dandy implies someone trying too hard. 'It's that underlying confidence in dressing well which has come back.' The designer says men's tastes are . influenced by stylish modern men like Gary Barlow, who wore an M&S . Best of British suit on The X Factor, and Sir Bradley Wiggins, who 'has . swagger'. He says Best of British model Oliver Cheshire is 'the boy'. 'He captures that London elegance.' For . AW14, the firm say their design team has referenced archive collections . for inspiration, creating timeless pieces which reference classic . sartorial periods - but with today's gentleman at the forefront. Best of British: Stylish modern men like Gary Barlow and Sir Bradley Wiggins have an underlying confidence that O'Connor attempted to evoke with his collection . Every . piece in the collection is carefully created with premium fabrics and . hand finishes, emphasising British craftsmanship and quality. A luxurious, contemporary palette runs throughout, combining warm tones of chocolate brown, camel and taupe. For the first time, eveningwear has been introduced into the collection. Debonair velvet tuxedo jackets and trousers in black and brown are cut in single and double breasted shapes. Outwear . sees the addition of leather and suede jackets into the range alongside . impeccably cut pieces from classic Crombie coats to double breasted . styles with sheepskin collar detail. Tailored suits cut a dashing silhouette in stripe and Prince of Wales check and were paired with coordinating ties. Formal jackets in bold weaves featured suede shoulder and elbow details while luxurious silk bow ties were paired with silk squares in graphic prints that were mixed and matched across the collection. Knitwear is simple yet refined as shawl neck collared cable knits are created in the softest cashmere yarns - the ultimate in contemporary casualwear. Graphic knits nod to retro styles whilst soft knit polo necks create a simple, understated look with jackets or suits. The Best of British Autumn/Winter collection is available in selected stores and online from October 2014.","This is M&S's first ever designer menswear range .

Alan Titchmarsh has insisted that TV gardeners like him were not responsible for causing floods by encouraging homeowners to pave over their gardeners. A Government adviser had previously suggested that gardening trends had worsened the flooding crisis by reducing the ability of the ground to absorb rainwater. The row comes as climate change activists step up their campaign to pin the cause of the floods which have ravaged Britain on global warming. Not guilty: Alan Titchmarsh says that TV gardeners have not been causing floods by encouraging householders to pave over their gardens . Claims: Lord Kerns, left, has suggesting that gardening programmes exacerbate flood risks, while Lord Stern, right, pins the blame on global warming . Lord Stern, the author of a controversial official report on climate change, insisted that rainfall was becoming 'ever more intense' and called for action to prevent 'devastating consequences' such as global conflict. Thousands of homes have been flooded in the Somerset Levels and the Thames Valley after two months of rain has left rivers swollen and the ground saturated. And while most people have blamed inadequate preparation from the Environment Agency and the unprecedented levels of rainfall, a leading scientist has proposed an alternative explanation. Lord Krebs, the head of Jesus College, Oxford and a Government adviser on climate change, blamed TV gardening shows for starting a trend of paving over gardens with concrete driveways, decking and patios. These renovations can worsen storms by preventing water seeping into the ground, forcing it to run off elsewhere, he said. Disaster: The village of Moorland in the Somerset Levels has been left almost completely underwater . Satellite images show that the proportion of gardens in English towns and cities which have been paved over nearly double between 2001 and 2011. 'We need TV gardeners to tell people not to put down patios and decking and have a lawn instead,' Lord Krebs said in a recent report on the future of flood risks. 'Flooding can have a devastating impact on people's lives and livelihoods. How we adapt to these risks will be critically important to our future resilience, whether it's deciding not to pave over our gardens, or building in less exposed areas.' He said there should be a campaign to 'get TV gardeners to tell people to stop putting down decking and paving and have lawns instead'. But Mr Titchmarsh, who became Britain's best-known gardener during six years of presenting Gardeners' World, insisted that TV personalities like him were not to blame. Drenched: Worcester is also heavily affected by flooding after the River Severn burst its banks . 'TV gardeners do not advocate paving over entire gardens, simply a small area in which to sit,' he told the Daily Star. Describing Lord Krebs's claim as 'laughable', Mr Titchmarsh instead pinned responsibility on the Government for failing to maintain waterways properly. 'The neglect of ditch clearing and dredging water courses has a far greater impact on surface water than the Government seems to acknowledge,' he said. The controversy coincides with a new push to link the floods to the impact of climate change. David Cameron said last month that he 'very much suspects' that the recent weeks of extreme weather can be pinned on global warming. Lord Stern, the author of a major report on the economic effects of climate change, today claimed that the wet and stormy conditions were 'no coincidence'. Waders: A man makes his way through the floodwater at Runnymede, next to the Thames . Writing in the Guardian, he said: 'If we do not cut emissions, we face even more devastating consequences.' The economist claimed that global climate change could lead to 'mass migration of hundreds of millions of people away from the worst-affected areas'. He concluded: 'That would lead to conflict and war, not peace and prosperity.' UN envoy Margareta Wahlstrom said that global warming was a 'driver of disaster' and claimed the Government should have stepped in decades ago. 'The science has been clear that climate variability is a driver of disaster for 40, 50 years,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'The science has been clear for decades already. We should have acted 10, 20 years ago.' The Swedish disaster expert, who is the secretary general's special representative for disaster risk reduction, called on officials to reduce building on flood plains in order to reduce the number of people affected in the event of flooding. Officials responsible for maintaining the Somerset Levels have warned that it may be necessary to move residents away from the low-lying area over the next few decades if rising sea levels make it more vulnerable.","Government adviser warns paved gardens are less able to absorb water .

But George Harrison always resented living in the songwriting shadow of Paul McCartney and John Lennon. Now newly released Cabinet Office papers reveal that Harrison turned down the ‘insensitive’ offer of an OBE – after McCartney was awarded a knighthood. The documents, obtained by The Mail on Sunday under Freedom of Information laws, reveal that Harrison, then 56, declined the chance to receive an OBE in the New Year Honours List of 2000.

McCartney had been awarded a knighthood in 1997. Those who knew Harrison said he would have regarded the lesser honour as ‘an insult’. The OBE was suggested by the Department for Culture, Media and  Sport to recognise his four decade-long career in showbusiness. But the citation for Harrison did not highlight his creative contribution to The Beatles’ success, stating simply: ‘He was a member of a band that many people would say is the best thing that Britain has ever produced, and possibly the best in the world, The Beatles.’ Journalist Ray Connolly, who knew The Beatles, said Harrison would have regarded the offer of the OBE as a snub. ‘Whoever it was who decided to offer him the OBE and not the knighthood was extraordinarily insensitive,’ he said. ‘George would have felt insulted – and with very good reason.’ On December 30, 1999, Harrison  was attacked in his Oxfordshire mansion by an knife-wielding intruder who punctured his lung and left him with  head injuries. He survived but died  of cancer in 2001. The Beatles were each awarded the MBE in 1965 – John Lennon later sent his back as a peace protest. Sir Paul, Harrison’s widow Olivia and son Dhani were unavailable for comment last night.

The study suggests these microbes may have survived in isolation from the Earth’s surface for billions of years. Nature produces hydrogen through 'serpentinisation.' When water meets the mineral olivine under pressure, the rock absorbs mostly oxygen atoms transforming olivine into serpentine. The complex network of fracturing also creates habitat for subsurface microbial communities . But what is even more remarkable is that these isolated life-forms created a community of genetically similar individuals - despite living continents apart. Researchers found microbes in rock fractures deep beneath the North American and European continents that are highly similar to samples a Princeton University group obtained from deep rock fractures in a Johannesburg-area mine shaft. These DNA sequences are also similar to microbes found in the rocky seabeds off the North American northwest and northeastern Japanese coasts. This suggests that microbes evolved from a common ancestor that lived at a time when life on Earth originated. Matt Schrenk of Michigan State said it . was unclear how similar microbes had spread to places as far apart as . South Africa, North America and Japan. Researchers found microbes in rock fractures in the North American and European continents that are highly similar to samples obtained from deep rock fractures in a Johannesburg-area mine shaft. These are also similar to microbes found in the seabeds off the North American northwest and northeastern Japanese coasts . ‘Two years ago we had a scant idea about what microbes are present in subsurface rocks or what they eat,’ said Dr Schrenk. ‘Since then a number of studies have vastly expanded that database. We're getting this emerging picture not only of what sort of organisms are found in these systems but some consistency between sites globally -- we're seeing the same types of organisms everywhere we look.’ Instead of being fuelled by sunlight, the life forms would have been given energy from chemical fuel in the form of hydrogen and methane which can be produced in certain types of rock under high temperatures and pressures. ‘It is easy to understand how birds or fish might be similar oceans apart, but it challenges the imagination to think of nearly identical microbes 16,000 km apart from each other in the cracks of hard rock at extreme depths, pressures, and temperatures,’ said Dr Schrenk. The latest discovery is at odds to theories that life was created 'primordial soup' of surface lakes and seas. Pictured is a representation of Atoms floating in a primordial soup .

The collection and coupling of microbiological and geochemical data made possible through the Deep Carbon Observatory is helping us understand and describe these phenomena.","Microbes have been living as deep as 5km (3.1 miles) below ground .

A woman was abducted and raped on Christmas Eve before being attacked and gang raped by another group of seven men just minutes later, it has been reported today. The 20-year-old woman's horrific ordeal took place while she was out with friends in Karaikal, Tamil Nadu, reports suggest. The woman, who is believed to work for a computer company, had been out sight seeing with a female friend and the latter's boyfriend, 17. The two women decided to go home to change during their visit on December 24. Three men, who the victim says had been watching her for a while, abducted her while she walked alone, taking her to a secluded place. One of group then allegedly raped her. The woman says she was then released by the man and attempted to get to safety and find her friends. The woman says that within a few minutes she was taken by another group of seven men. Six of the vile gang then took turns to rape her, she says. The woman's friends are reported to have made desperate attempts to find the girl - eventually finding the group and confronting them. When a fight broke out, a neighbour called police who arrived on the scene, according to The Times of India. The newspaper says the woman was helped by officers - who arrested three men on the spot - when they arrived and taken to a nearby police station. Seven men were later arrested in connection to the alleged crime. Protests: Violence and rape of women in India has led to scores of protests across the capital, such as this one in New Dehli . A further three are thought to have been identified by officers, but are reported to have absconded. Senior officer Monika Bahardwaj said police have launched a investigation to verify the woman's shocking claims. Two officers have been suspended from their duties due to lapses in handling the crime, she added. The alleged crime is just one in a list of reported rapes and violent attacks on India's streets. Most famously, a young woman was killed when she was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi last December.

The start of a new year sees millions go on a diet in an attempt to shift their post-Christmas bulge. But which weight-loss plans actually work? A new survey suggests the most successful dieters reach for their smartphones. Consumer Reports magazine asked 9,000 of its readers to reveal what commercial and DIY diet plans they had been on and rate how successful they were. Weighty issue: A survey has revealed which diets promoted the best customer satisfaction . While people lost 'significant' weight on all 13 of the plans in the survey the free mobile app MyFitnessPal got the highest reader score. The app, allows the user to count the calories they consume during the day using a huge database of foods and recipes. You can roll the counter backwards to take account of exercise. Of the 9 DIY plans, MyFitnessPal . received an overall satisfaction score of 83 and top marks for . maintenance, calorie awareness, and food variety. Calorie-counting apps like myfitnesspal provide an easy way for dieters to keep track of their progress . While Weight Watchers is still the . people's choice, chosen by four out of 10 Consumer Reports' readers, its . scoring on satisfaction was not as impressive as MyFitnessPal, achieving 74 out of 100. However, it did receive the highest score for a commercial diet plan. 'We were fascinated by the results . because satisfaction scores did not correlate well with actual weight . loss,' said Nancy . Metcalf , senior program editor at Consumer Reports, which is a non-profit organisation. The Consumer Report survey revealed... Dieters should keep expectations in check.  Medical . consultants say that dieters often overestimate how much weight they can lose . Tracking calories and physical activity helps maintain motivation. This was used by 87% of MyFitnessPal users . Use all the tools available on a plan. Weight Watchers members felt more satisfied and lost more weight if they went to meetings compared to those who followed the diet online . Consumers preferred diets that helped them maintain weight loss and prescribed easy-to-make lifestyle changes . Some diets on the Consumer Reports' list were built around restricting major categories of food, such as Atkins. Of these the Paleo Diet was best-liked . 'You can lose on any diet plan if it works for you, but it seems . that dieters balance weight loss against other factors such as the . extent to which a diet is sustainable or easy to follow.' In the commercial category, Medifast . got the second highest satisfaction score (70), followed by Jenny Craig (66) and Nutrisystem (56). In terms of initial . weight loss, Medifast was the only commercial plan to receive an above . average rating. A typical weight loss for men was 20 to 43 pounds while it was 14 to 40 . pounds for women. The Paleo Diet, which . instructs dieters to eat like a caveman, came second for DIY diets with an 80 score. This was followed . by the Mediterranean Diet (77) and SparkPeople (76) which is an app and website. The results of the survey reflect the broadening landscape of diets that subscribers reported using. 'The rapid emergence of new apps to help dieters crunch numbers and stay on top of their calories and exercise regimens is clearly having an enormous impact that our new methodology was able to capture,' said Metcalf. In 2011, the last time Consumer Reports rated diets, it based the Ratings on the results of clinical trials and a nutritional analysis. The report, in next month's copy of Consumer Reports, notes that readers gave high marks to the diets that helped them maintain weight loss and that prescribed lifestyle changes that were easy to make. Aerobic exercise is better for weight loss than resistance training such as using weights, a study shows. The largest trial carried out to compare the two found that aerobic exercise - low intensity workouts which exercise the heart - was more effective than anaerobic, such as short springs and weight training. It was particularly true where time constraints were an issue, reports the Journal of Applied Physiology. The authors say ‘it may be time to seriously reconsider the conventional wisdom’ that resistance training, which helps build muscle, is best for weight loss. The team studied 234 previously sedentary overweight or obese people aged 18-70, who were enrolled in one of three eight-month supervised training programmes: aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), or a combination (AT/RT). Those assigned to aerobic training exercised vigorously, at about 70-85 per cent of maximum heart rate, for 45 minutes three days per week throughout the study period. Those doing weight training also exercised three days a week, completing three sets of 8-12 reps on eight resistance machines that targeted all major muscle groups. The third group did both sets of exercise. At the end of the study, the only people who had not lost weight were the resistance trainers, who actually gained weight due to an increase in lean body mass. Those who did aerobic exercise saw their waist circumference and fat mass significantly decrease. Lead author Leslie Willis, from North Carolina's Duke University Medical Centre, said: ‘Given our observations, it may be time to seriously reconsider the conventional wisdom that resistance training alone can lead to weight and fat loss.’","MyFitnessPal scored the highest in satisfaction levels in a survey of 13 popular weight-loss plans .

Dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact.

Their calculations suggest the solar system would move through a dark matter disc every 35 million years, according to a report in the New Scientist. A similar pattern was previously seen in research of comet impacts on Earth, which highlighted that they appear to increase every 35 million years. The team looked to see if there was a connection between comet impacts and the solar system moving through the dark matter disc. When the solar system moves through a disc, it faces a strong gravitational pull that disrupts areas such as the Oort cloud, which could trigger movement in space rocks towards Earth. The team looked at large craters on Earth that were created in the last 250 million years. Their analysis suggested that the dark matter idea would be more likely to produce the observed patterns in crater impacts than an average rate of impact. However, the crater that has been linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago does not completely coincide with the solar system passing through the disc. The paper said there's not enough data to make this more than ‘a fascinating possibility worthy of further exploration.’","As solar system orbits centre of galaxy, it moves around in 70m year cycle .

A beloved St Louis musician has fallen 18 feet to his death down an elevator shaft in a tragic accident. Bob Reuter, a longtime fixture on the local music scene, was moving into a loft on Saturday afternoon when he stepped into the dark elevator shaft, assuming the elevator was there. But it wasn't and he plunged to the ground, leaving three friends who had been helping him move in shock at the top. The accident happened shortly before 2 p.m., in the apartment at 1129 St Charles Street, said St. Louis Fire Capt. David Neighbors. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Beloved St Louis musician Bob Reuter, pictured, has fallen 18 feet to his death down an elevator shaft in a tragic accident . The elevator had a swing door to enter rather than automatic doors that only open when the elevator has arrived. It had no kind of safety grill. 'It does appear to be a tragic accident,' Neighbors told Fox News. 'The access to the door was open and the individual was able to step in and felt the elevator was there and in fact it was not.' He said Reuter fell 18 feet from the lobby entrance to a freight elevator landing in the basement at the bottom of the shaft. Firefighters found the elevator car positioned well above the first floor. The Missouri Department of Public Safety oversees inspections of elevators and, according to Riverfronttimes.com, online records show the one Reuter fell down had no operating certificate listed and was installed nearly 100 years ago, in 1918. Death plunge: Reuter was moving into the Downtown St Louis building, pictured right, when he fell to his death on Saturday . Help: Reuter's three friends who were helping him move called for help after he stepped into the elevator . St Louis officials told local media that the building was inspected in May and problems with emergency-exit signage and lights were flagged, however the building addressed those problems. The elevator in question was locked and out of commission, building inspectors noted at the time. Since then it was obviously reopened. St Louis, Reuter's longtime home, is reeling after the horrific loss of the 61-year-old who was also a talented photographer and had a slot on KDHX (88.1FM) called 'Bob's Scratchy Records.' Reuter had most recently been playing with new band, Alley Ghost, but in the past has collaborated with scores of artists including Wilco's Jeff Tweedy. Tributes: Tributes are pouring in for the musician who was a longtime fixture on the St Louis music scene . Other talents: Reuter, pictured, was also a talented photographer . 'I consider this an irreplaceable loss for the St. Louis music community,' said longtime friend and record store owner Tom Ray. Another friend, Alley Ghost co-founder and guitarist, Matt Wilson said: 'Bob was such a prolific artist. His mediums were vast, and he inspired me on a lot of different levels.' Chris Baricevic of Big Muddy Records was named by Reuter as executor of his will. He is planning a service to honor the musician's work and life on September 8 and is raising funds to pay for it. Any extra donations will go to a fund created in Reuter's name to support disadvantaged artists. 'Words fail at this moment,' Baricevic wrote in a statement. 'But please know that in these trying times, the best is brought out in the world. Let's stay positive. Let's focus on the important things - the beauty that was put into the world by a man and his work.'","Bob Reuter, a longtime fixture on the St Louis music scene, was moving into a Downtown loft on Saturday .

German chancellor Angela Merkel has been depicted as Hitler henchman in Greek newspaper Democracy . Anger: Protesters have burned German flags during demonstrations against austerity measures the Greek government has been forced to succumb to . The backlash has been provoked by Germany’s role in driving through painful measures to stop Greece's debt crisis from spiralling even further out of control. Greece believes the Germans keep changing the requirements needed to access a 130billion euro tranche of bailout funds. This week it was told it had to cut an extra 325million euros from its budget and a meeting, where it was due to be told it would receive the bailout cash, was cancelled at the last minute. The satirical protests, which have been followed with violent riots, compare the German government with the Nazis who occupied the country in the Second World War.

Posters with Merkel dressed as an officer in Hitler’s regime, wearing a swastika armband bearing the EU stars logo on the outside, with the words 'public nuisance' underneath, have also appeared. Newspaper cartoons present modern-day German officials dressed in Third Reich regalia, and Greek government officials who agree to belt-tightening moves as 'Sieg Heil' saluters. German visitors flocking to ancient tourist sites are also being met with a hostile welcome from some Greeks. Berlin's interference has revived historical enmities and evoked comparisons to the massive destruction of Greece at the hands of Hitler’s Germany more than 65 years ago.

Germany occupied Greece from 1941 to 1944 and, despite the old West Germany helping in no small part to rebuild the conquered land's economy, relations have never really recovered. In 1957 Greek authorities detained Maximilian Merten, the former German wartime military administrator of the northern city of Thessaloniki. He was later tried for war crimes and sentenced to 25 years in prison. But he was quietly released soon after because, as archives opened in 1990 revealed, the Greeks freed him in return for securing economic co-operation with West Germany.","Protesters burn German flags and depict Merkel in Nazi uniform .

Some things are a bit different at Barcelona these days. Others, like Lionel Messi stay exactly the same. ‘How have you gone from the Disney house to the haunted house?’ was one of the more imaginative questions asked of Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano at the club’s training ground on Tuesday. Mascherano didn’t really have much of an answer to that one. To be fair to him, he probably didn’t really understand it. Still here: Some things never change... like Lionel Messi's class . He will lead us to glory: Barcelona and Argentina team-mate Javier Mascherano sung his praises on Tuesday . He did, however, have something to say when asked to pick up on another popular narrative of the times in Catalonia, namely the supposed decline of Lionel Messi. That’s Messi of almost a goal a game for club and country this season, by the way. ‘Leo is a leader,’ he said. ‘He is trying to make us achieve in as many competitions as possible. With him, we can do it.’ What else would Mascherano say? He is hardly likely to sit there and suggest that Messi should be  bundled on to the next plane to  Buenos Aires. Nevertheless, just as it is ridiculous to expect one footballer to criticise another in such a public forum, so it is to suggest that Messi’s time at the Nou Camp may be short. Certainly the explosive, astonishing episodes that illuminated Messi’s season in La Liga last time round have been thinner on the ground this time. Just as Barcelona have at times lacked a little sparkle, so has he. No 1: Messi was back to his brilliant best on Wednesday night, tormenting Manchester City from start to finish . New star: He has had to share the limelight with Neymar, but the pair dovetailed magnificently at the Nou Camp . Delight: Messi dinks the ball over Joe Hart in the Manchester City goal . Not quite: Hart could do nothing to stop the beautifully executed chip . Lionel Messi has overtaken Raul as the top Champions League scorer with a single club... 1 Messi 67 . 2 Raul 66 . 3 Cristiano Ronaldo 46 . (Raul scored five goals with Schalke so is still top overall) Maybe it is the passing of time that is to blame. That is unlikely, though. The four-time winner of the Ballon D’Or is only 26. More likely it has been the presence of a new forward partner, the Brazilian Neymar. Whatever the case, there was little sign of personal decline here on Wednesday night. Barcelona could have been three goals up in half-an-hour or so and Messi was at the heart of most of what was dangerous about Gerardo Martino’s team. The tackle and foul he drew from Joleon Lescott in the opening stages was typical. Show the opponent the ball and then make it disappear as the challenge arrives. The Manchester City defender fouled Messi and should have been punished with a penalty but the referee didn’t see it. That’s always been the problem with Messi. He sucks defenders into making challenges that seem like a good idea at the time. More often than not, though, flailing legs find only fresh air — or his ankles. Too quick: He ought to have had a penalty when Joleon Lescott brought him down in the box early on . Despair: A tackle often seems like a good idea at the time... On a night when City spent long periods looking comfortable, they looked distinctly less so whenever Messi had the ball. Twice he played in Neymar for good opportunities in the first half, while Xavi should have scored when his team-mate slipped an exquisite ball through to him. In the second half, one of Messi’s familiar lateral forays — it’s simply too dangerous to tackle him once he reaches the penalty area — saw him strike the inside of the post. In that particular instance he looked as  dangerous as ever. The beauty of his football, and of Barcelona’s, has always been in its simplicity. When the Spanish champions play at their best it is like watching a five-a-side team. When Barca did click last night this is how they did it. Messi’s goal, when it eventually came, arrived on the back of a mistake from Lescott but his execution was clinical. Torment: Messi gave Lescott and Vincent Kompany a torrid evening, running at them and assisting others . Much love: Barca and Messi were at their best when they kept it simple, it was like watching a 5-a-side team . Support: The fans adore the Argentine, and it's little wonder why after displays like this . City, for their part, can count themselves fortunate and unfortunate all at the same time. Certainly they should have been at least one goal down early on. Messi should have had his penalty while Neymar’s early ‘goal’ was disallowed for an offside that only the officials saw. However, there were also periods  that saw the Barclays Premier League team worry Barcelona. Unlike the first leg at the Etihad Stadium when City could only unsettle Barcelona on the break, they saw enough of the ball last night to create opportunities at their own pace. Before the game, City’s Vincent Kompany suggested that one goal could ‘change the dynamic’. That goal almost arrived when substitute Edin Dzeko twice worried Victor Valdes early in the second half. Ultimately, despite the sides grabbing a goal apiece just before the end, the superior team prevailed, as we always thought they would.

"By . Ted Thornhill . UPDATED: . 10:09 EST, 2 January 2012 . A 5000-year-old temple in Orkney could be more important than Stonehenge, according to archaeologists. The site, known as the Ness of Brodgar, was investigated by BBC2 documentary A History of Ancient Britain, with presenter Neil Oliver describing it as ‘the discovery of a lifetime’. So far the remains of 14 Stone Age buildings have been excavated, but thermal geophysics technology has revealed that there are 100 altogether, forming a kind of temple precinct. 'More important than Stonehenge': The temple precinct being uncovered in Orkney contains 100 Stone Age buildings . Until now Stonehenge was considered to have been the centre of Neolithic culture, but that title may now go to the Orkney site, which contains Britain’s earliest known wall paintings. Oliver said: ‘The excavation of a vast network of buildings on Orkney is allowing us to recreate an entire Stone Age world. ‘It’s opening a window onto the mysteries of Neolithic religion.’ Big draw: Britain's earliest examples of artwork have been found on the walls at the Orkney site . The site in Orkney is surrounded by other Neolithic remains . Experts believe that the site will give us insights into what Neolithic people believed about the world and the universe. Nick . Card, an archaeologist from the University of the Highlands and . Islands, said: ‘It’s an archaeologist’s dream site. The excitement of . the site never fades. ‘This site is a one-off.’ Professor Mark Edmonds from the University of York, meanwhile, describes the excavation as ‘a site of international importance’. Some parts of the temple are 800 years older than Stonehenge, which lies 500 miles to the south in Wiltshire. The site is very close to the Ring of Brodgar stone circle and the standing stones of Stenness and is surrounded by a wall believed to have been 10-feet high. Archaeologists found red zigzag lines on some of the buildings’ inner walls that they believe is Stone Age art – the oldest ever found. So far only around 10 per cent of the site has been examined – and it could take decades to uncover and analyse everything there.

Heather Weir and boyfriend Jamie Ness could not understand why their normally active golden labrador wanted to sleep all day . Stoke City's Jamie Ness and his model girlfriend Heather Weir say they owe their lives to their pet labrador after his strange behaviour prompted them to call in engineers. They could not understand why their normally active dog Alfie suddenly wanted to sleep all day. Investigations eventually revealed that the couple's Aga cooker was leaking lethal carbon monoxide gas that could have killed them. One-year-old Alfie was sleepy because he was being slowly poisoned by the colourless, odourless gas. Weir, 22, said: 'Without his strange behaviour Jamie and I would have went months not realizing what was leaking into our home. 'I love him so much and I'm so thankful to have such a wonderful companion - he saved our life.' The 21-year-old midfielder moved from Glasgow to a new home in Cheshire with his girlfriend in July when he left Rangers for Stoke. He is yet to play for Tony Pulis's team in the Barclays Premier League but has represented Scotland through the age groups. After noticing a strange smell, Heather had the stove checked and discovered it had been serviced and passed that month. However, she said: 'Within the past four weeks, Alfie was sleeping all day. He had stopped playing with his toys and was just very lethargic.' After returning from a family trip to the United States, Heather noticed Alfie was getting worse. She said: 'He just wasn't right at all. Usually Alfie would be up and down like a yo-yo pestering me to play but instead, he went up to our room and slept for five hours.' Heather had experienced a few brief moments of sickness but Jamie did not show any symptoms at all. Determined to get the bottom of Alfie's strange behaviour, she called an engineer out to the home who immediately realised what was happening. He told the couple that if Heather had not picked up on Alfie's sickness their exposure to the carbon monoxide leaking from the stove 'could have been fatal'. Lucky escape: Stoke City Jamie Ness controls the ball against the Columbus Crew in July . Heather with Alfie: 'He makes our house a home', she said . Alfie's unusual behaviour alerted his owners to the carbon monoxide poisoning . 'I explained about Alfie and myself and he was so genuinely concerned and happy that he'd discovered this for us before it could have been fatal,' she said. 'He explained that the smell of gas was not nearly as dangerous as the issue with the leak of carbon monoxide. 'I cannot believe how lucky we are - had we not caught this when we did, it could have been fatal to us all. 'I don't know what I'd do without Alfie - he makes our house a home.' She added: 'Within two days of the problem being solved Alfie is back to his usual self.' Carbon monoxide poisoning claims the lives of around 50 people a year in the UK. Heather and Jamie said their dog was now back to his usual happy self . Stephanie Trotter OBE, president and director of CO-Gas Safety who raise awareness and publish data of CO deaths and accidents, said that carbon monoxide prevention needs a ""belt and braces"" approach. She said: 'Firstly, well done to the dog and well done to the girl. 'Often our dogs, cats and other pets are more susceptible to the gas because of their smaller lungs and weight. 'That's . why miners used to take canaries down the mines - if they stopped . singing you knew to get out because there was CO present. 'We . encourage all homes to open windows for ventilation, have their . chimneys regularly swept and install detectors - it really has to be a . belt and braces approach to keeping an eye on CO.' The RSPCA said pet owners should be more aware of their pets' behaviour. A . spokesman said: 'This demonstrates the importance of pet owners being . aware of their pet's normal behaviour and of being observant. 'If they do notice any change in their . pet's behaviour it's important to seek advice from their vet as it could . be a sign that their pet is suffering from a medical problem.' Paul Johnston, chief executive of . Gas Safe Register, commented: 'The couple involved in this incident had a . lucky escape, but tragically others are not always so fortunate. 'Carbon . monoxide is a highly poisonous gas. You can't see it, taste it or smell . it and without an adequate supply of fresh air, it can kill quickly. 'The symptoms are also very similar to flu, which at this time of year is worrying if people get the two confused.'

A $5 million Kansas City manor has been destroyed after what officials believe was an accidental fire that started in the property's vast attic. Sitting on bluffs just north of the Missouri River, the 15,000-square foot Briarcliff home - owned by local property developer Charles Garney and his wife Patty, is famous to downtown residents - visible from Highway 169 and famous for hosting fundraisers and political events. It took 80 firefighters to control the three-alarm blaze after it broke out some before 11pm on Thursday, according to KCTV. The couple had been at a local basketball tournament that night and returned home separately. Scroll down for video . The prominent Garney family's palatial home with panoramic views of downtown Kansas City was destroyed in a fire on Thursday night . The elegant red-brick home was built in 1995 to look like an English country manor. It is perched on a cliff overlooking downtown Kansas City and has hosted countless parties and events . Ruined: The fire is believed to have started in the attic below the home's beautiful slanted slate ceilings, which largely contained the blaze until it broke through . Damage: The Garney family say they plan to rebuild the home, rather than knock it down and start from scratch . Fire crews managed to attack the flames from inside the house to begin with, before being forced to retreat . The fire can be seen here breaking the slate roof of the Kansas City manor . Charles Garney was already home and asleep when Patty Garney arrived with their house guest. She told firefighters she had only been home about 15 minutes and was about to go to bed when she went to check on their dog. She then noticed a glow coming from the skylights of a two-story ball room at the center of the house. 'I determined it was fire because it was moving and I could see it jumping,' Patty told The Kansas City Star. She quickly woke her husband and guest, who then reversed the couple's cars out of the garage, putting the dog in one of them. Patty said she grabbed her cell phone and purse, at which point the smoke and fire alarms were going off. It took the swarm of firefighters more than three hours to contain the blaze. They spent some time inside the home before being forced to retreat and attack it from outside using ladders. More than 80 firefighters arrived at the scene, some of whom managed to grab valuables from inside the house, such as paintings and crystal . Emotional: Owner Patty Garney was the last to go to bed in the house on Thursday night when she noticed the fire . The glow: Patty Garney said she only realized there was a fire when she saw a strange glow 'that wasn't meant to be there' coming from a skylight. She said she could not smell any smoke at that point . Some of them managed to grab valuable items from the home, such as paintings and crystal.

Watching the flames eat away at the building was 'pretty tough, for sure,' Patty Garney said . Officials fought the fire from within the house approximately 23 minutes, before evacuating and going defensive . The loss is estimated between $5 and $8 million.

Six-year-old Charlee Nelson died on Saturday after battling a debilitating neurological disorder called Batten disease. On Thursday, the Utah Legislature passed a law named for Charlee that allows children with seizure-inducing conditions to have access to non-intoxicating cannabis oil, which has anti-seizure properties. Little angel: Charlee Nelson died surrounded by family on Saturday, just days after Charlee's Law passed . Debilitating: Charlee's mother, Catrina Nelson, was heartbroken as her daughter suffered seizures and the loss of her faculties as a result of Batten disease . Charlee's parents Catrina and Jeff Nelson had their daughter on a waiting list for the oil but her rapidly declining condition prevented them from taking part in the legislative process. On Tuesday, Catrina Nelson said she was called and asked if the family would allow HB105 to be named for Charlee. 'I didn't know what to say,' Catrina Nelson told the Deseret News. 'I was honored, but we felt unworthy of it because we hadn't done much for the bill. It was the selfless act of these women who were fighting and doing so much to allow it to be called Charlee's Law. It was just incredible.' Charlee Nelson was just three-and-a-half when she had her first seizure. Up until that point, she had been a normal, healthy little girl who loved dancing and singing. Doctors were baffled by Charlee's sudden illness and it took 21 months before her family had a diagnosis: Batten disease. Sudden: Before the illness came on, Charlee was a healthy three-year-old who loved to sing and dance . 'It was the worst thing because you're watching your child go from a normal, active little girl to not being able to walk, talk, see and in the meantime you're doing all these tests and they're coming up empty and it's like what the heck is happening to her?' her mother told the Deseret News. The diagnosis was no relief for the Nelson family. Over time the rare condition leads to mental impairment, worsening seizures, loss of sight, speech and motor skills, and eventually death. 'It used to cause her pain,' Catrina Nelson said. 'She would cry and cry and she was confused about what was going on and didn't understand. It was horrible to watch her fall and bump her face and her head and her teeth.' Brave: By the age of six, Charlee couldn't see, eat, speak or walk and sometimes suffered hundreds of seizures a day . Youngest child: Charlee (being held by father Jeff) with her family . Cannabis oil wouldn't have cured Charlee's condition, but it would have helped ease the severity of her brain-damaging seizures and prolonging and improving her quality of life. Towards the end of her life, Charlee was having as many as 500 seizures a day. The oil will also help children with untreatable epilepsy. On March 4, Charlee returned home from the hospital to spend the rest of her life with her parents, brother and sister. The Tuesday before her death, she made her last outing, to be present as Utah senators cast their votes on Charlee's Law. The bill passed both the Utah Senate and House of Representatives. Jeff and Catrina Nelson say they wish their little girl had had the chance to try the treatment, but they are happy that other sick children will now benefit from it. 'In the House when all the representatives stood up and gave her a round of applause, she perked up like she knew it was for her,' father Jeff Nelson told the Salt Lake City Tribune.","Charlee Nelson, 6, died Saturday after suffering from a rare seizure-inducing condition called Batten disease .

Federal prosecutors asked a judge Monday to bar Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from seeing some of the gruesome autopsy photos of the three people killed in the attack. In a court filing, prosecutors said Tsarnaev should only be allowed to look at autopsy photos that will be used during his trial and sentencing. They said he should not be allowed to see the many other photos that will not be used against him in court. 'Allowing photos of the mutilated bodies of the victims to be viewed by the man accused of mutilating them would needlessly revictimize the family members in the same way that innocent children who are photographed pornographically are revictimized whenever those photos are seen by others,' prosecutors wrote. Violating victims' rights: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (left) is accused of the Boston bombings, which killed third-grader Martin Richard (right) and injured his mother and sister . Miriam Conrad, one of Tsarnaev's lawyers, declined to comment on the request. In their motion, prosecutors say they told the defense that if Tsarnaev were allowed to view all the photographs, the government would continue to make them available for lawyers' review but would not provide copies. They said Tsarnaev's lawyers 'refused to accept any limitation on Tsarnaev's ability to view the autopsy photos and repeated their demand for copies of all of them.' Tsarnaev, 19, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction. More than half the charges carry a possible death sentence. Prosecutors allege that he and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, built two pressure cooker bombs and placed them near the finish line of last year's marathon. Twin explosions killed two women and an eight-year-old boy and injured more than 260. Victims: Also killed were Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old Boston University student from China, and Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old from Arlington . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following a shootout with police several days after the April 15 marathon. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is being held in a federal prison as he awaits a trial scheduled to begin in November. In their motion, prosecutors ask to limit Tsarnaev's access to autopsy photos of the three bombing victims and MIT police Officer Sean Collier, who prosecutors allege was killed by the Tsarnaev brothers on April 18 as they fled. Suffolk University Law School professor Christopher Dearborn said he believes it will be difficult to persuade a judge to restrict Tsarnaev's access to the autopsy photos, especially because he could be sentenced to death. 'The problem here is if there's any possibility that there's something in those photos that could be helpful or potentially helpful to him in a trial or in sentencing, he has to be allowed access to them,' Dearborn said. 'What they are really trying to do is make a strong statement on behalf of the victims' families, and they have a right to do that. I just don't think that right can trump the constitutional rights of the defendant.'","Federal prosecutors don't want Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to see any photos of his victims bar the one that will be used during his trial .

In a statement issued by his lawyer, Ethan Kirschner, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto said Monday that he did not 'create, invent or otherwise work on' bitcoin. In the magazine's return to print this month after more than a year, Newsweek's cover story declared Nakamoto the 'face behind bitcoin'. Nakamoto, 64, did not say whether he plans to sue the magazine. 'I'm not him': Satoshi Nakamoto, the man named by Newsweek as the creator of Bitcoin, has now hired a lawyer in an attempt to have the article retracted. He has not said whether he plans to sue the magazine . Statement: Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto has gone to great lengths to prove he is not the creator of bitcoin, and today released this statement . In a statement made public early this morning, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, the subject of NewsweekÂ¿s controversial Bitcoin cover story, continued to deny any involvement with the currency, noting that he is 'writing this statement to clear [his] name' The creator of bitcoin - which has just installed its first ATM in Singapore (pictured) - was named as 'Satoshi Nakamoto', who created a complex form of electronic cash several years. Nakamoto says he is not that man . Nakamoto repeated that he had not heard of bitcoin until his son told him a reporter asked about it in mid-February. He said he has not been able to find steady work for 10 years and had cancelled his Internet service last year 'due to severe financial distress'. Nakamoto added that he is trying to recover from prostate surgery in 2012 and a stroke he suffered last October. 'My prospects for gainful employment has been harmed because of Newsweek's article,' he said in the statement. 'Newsweek's false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year-old mother, my siblings, and their families.' Satoshi Nakamoto, an unemployed computer engineer, says he plans to fight to clear his name of the 'creator of bitcoin' that Newsweek magazine named him as . Newsweek said in a statement that it 'has not received any statement or letter from either Mr. Nakamoto or his legal counsel'. 'If and when we do, we will respond as necessary,' the publication said. On March 6, the day Newsweek posted its story online, about a dozen journalists descended on the home where Nakamoto lives with his mother in Temple City, Calif. Nakamoto denied ever being involved with bitcoin multiple times, including during an exclusive two-hour interview with the AP in which he discussed his life, career, family and addressed the assertions in Newsweek's piece. Newsweek reporter Leah McGrath . Goodman spend two months searching for the elusive founder of Bitcoin, . which she identified in a cover story Thursday as 64-year-old Dorian . Satoshi Nakamoto. Were they right? Nakamoto affirms he was not the . founder of Bitcoin, but Newsweek magazine was confident enough to out . him after two months of research . The . founder of the digital currency has never come forward, but a proposal . for the project published online in 2008 is signed by a Satoshi . Nakamoto, with a corresponding email address. Goodman . used the name as a basis for search, and found a man she believed . matched the founder's profile while looking through registration card of . naturalized U.S. citizens. Goodman's . firmest evidence that the Temple City, California resident known as . Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto is the real Bitcoin father was when she showed . up to his house after corresponding with him via email. She says when she showed up outside the modest home, Nakamoto refused to come to the door but he did peak out of the blinds. Eventually the police showed up after he called them to say he was scared he would 'get into trouble' for talking to her. Nakamoto came out when police arrived and Goodman was able to get him to comment once. 'I . am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,' he said before . returning inside. 'It's been turned over to other people. They are in . charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.' In . addition to Nakamoto's subtle acknowledgement to Goodman, she also . interviewed his family and Bitcoin developers to  learn more about the . mysterious founder. While . family members, including two of Nakamoto's children and his estranged . wife, Goodman interviewed were unaware that he created Bitcoin, they . also said they wouldn't be surprised it he had and was just keeping it a . secret. ' You're not going to be able to get to him. He'll deny everything. He'll . never admit to starting Bitcoin,' Nakamoto's youngest brother said. Goodman . also spoke with programmers like Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin's current . Chief Scientist) who corresponded with the person 'or entity' known as . Nakamoto in the early years of Bitcoin, but he seemed to cease . communication in early 2011. 'Back . then, it was not clear that creating Bitcoin might be a legal thing to . do.

Her brother, Earl 'Bubba' Hiers, who owns Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House in Savannah, Georgia, received a less than stellar public health inspection report for his restaurant, with violations that included inadequate hand washing facilities for staff and not keeping some foods at the right cold temperature. Two of the violations during the Feb. 7 visit from health inspectors was for repeat offenses, according to the official report posted by Radar Online. Paula Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers attend Paula Deen's Kitchen grand opening at Chicago Harrah's Joliet Casino & Hotel on April 5, 2012 . One was for using a hand sink as a dump . sink, and the other was for not keeping foods that need to be kept cold . below 41 degrees Fahrenheit. With the latter violation, the food in . question was thrown out and the problem corrected during the visit. Overall, Uncle Bubba's received a score of 83 out of 100, which is considered a 'B' rating by the Georgia Department of Public Health. Scores between 70 and 79 are given a 'C.' However, the restaurant's cleanliness score has dropped since its prior inspection on Nov. 6, 2013, when it scored a 90, earning an 'A' rating. Bubba may want to seek the advice of her sister when it comes to keeping a restaurant more in line with health codes.

'That’s why we’re recalling all machines and implementing an engineering fix in each one.' Earlier this month the company released a 'near silent' update to its bladeless fan that it claims is quieter than a buzzing mosquito.

Wiltshire-based Dyson, which employs more than 3,600 staff worldwide, was founded in 1992 and now sells machines, including vacuum cleaners and hand dryers, in more than 50 markets. Max Conze, Dyson CEO, said: 'We have sold a million heaters around the world; we have seen a small number short-circuit, which in four cases resulted in contained burning.

While most actresses dread their fourth decade, Cameron Diaz had an incredible reaction to turning 40. 'I was so excited,' she told Oprah in an interview with OWN on Sunday night, she added: 'The actress says she woke up on her birthday and thought, ""Oh, now life begins. Oh, this is it! This is the coolest thing ever.""' She explained how she embraced the ageing process, telling Oprah, 60: 'It's a gradual thing and you get to learn about yourself and see yourself and start to live with who you are as you go.' Scroll down for video... 'We're expected to defy nature': Cameron Diaz has opened up about her battle to age naturally in an Oprah interview . It would've been so easy for Cameron . to go the way of other stunning movie stars; under the knife, straight . to the nearest filler specialist and heavy on the Botox. But . after a brush with Hollywood's favourite face freezer left the . Something About Mary feeling disengaged with her own face; the blonde . beauty - still one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood - made the . tough decision to allow herself to age naturally. And on Sunday, Cameron  - who landed a $40M paycheck for 2011's Bad Teacher, which is way above the standard for leading ladies and twice what a male contemporary like Leo DiCaprio can command - opened up to Oprah Winfrey about taking a stand against ageism in society. She said that it is ‘crazy’ how women are under pressure to look like they are 25 even when they are more mature. Botox ban: Cameron has been open about using the face freezing toxin and how she disliked the results . Refreshingly different: Cameron has joined Sharon Stone in breaking ranks with the perennially youthful Hollywood crowd . She said that women ‘don’t give . ourselves permission to age gracefully’ and that they are constantly . told they have to ‘defy nature’. Diaz herself has in the past fallen victim to the guilt she describes and has had Botox which she regrets as it changed her face in a ‘weird way’. She had a nose job after breaking it four times and has spoken about her battle with acne, revealing that she tried everything from makeup to medication to make it go away. Diaz said: ‘For me I feel like if I - it is almost as if we have failed if we don't remain 25 for the rest of our lives. Her face wasn't her own: Cameron wants to keep her own look, and she isn't afraid of wrinkles . Comedy actress: Cameron has undeniably more range than her Botox using contemporaries . Speaking up for the sisterhood: Cameron has joined Sharon Stone in the quest to be realistic about the ageing process . ‘Like we are failures. It is a personal failure. Like our fault that at 40 years old that I still don't look like I'm 25.’ Arguably, it;s Cameron's determination to grow into her own face that's ensured she's stayed at the top of the Hollywood casting tree, certainly her lucrative Bad Teacher role relied on her ability to mug it up in a way the Botox queens just can't. Her latest role, as Miss Hannigan in the remake of Annie alongside Jamie Foxx and with Quvenzhané Wallis as the titular star, involves similar comedy. Diaz has just released her lifestyle guide The Body Book which champions a healthy way of living . Feigning indignation, she said: ‘Oh, I'm sorry. I apologise, I wasn't able to defy nature.’ Diaz agreed with Winfrey that everyone's trying to be ‘back there,’ in the past. She said: ‘Women don't allow other women to age gracefully, and we don't give ourselves permission to age gracefully, everybody’s judging.’ Cameron, pictured aged 26 in her breakthrough role in There's Something About Mary, spoke about how women feel they have somehow failed if they don't look like they are in their 20s . Diaz, who has just released her lifestyle guide The Body Book, gave the interview weeks after Sharon Stone spoke out about how she ‘wanted to die’ when she put on weight in her 20s. The Basic Instinct star, 55, said that she cried uncontrollably after being taunted by men who wolf whistled at her curves and larger breasts. In a frank interview she also said that years later she suffered a relapse and teared up in the  bathroom with a bottle of wine as she told herself: ‘I’m not coming out until I can totally accept the way I look.’ Now and then: Cameron said on Monday she stopped using Botox, which may be why she looked so smooth back in May (right) last year .

Mexican drug cartels have moved beyond drug trafficking as their main source of income, it has been revealed. The Knights Templar cartel in western Mexico has long been known for making money from the production and transportation of drugs, such as methamphetamine, or 'crystal meth'. But now, it has turned to illegal mining, logging and extortion for its income, according to a government official. New source of income: Mexican drug cartels have moved beyond drug trafficking as their main source of income, it has been revealed. Above, a confiscated iron ore mining operation near Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico . Confiscated: The Knights Templar cartel has turned to illegal mining, logging and extortion for its income. Above, the same mining site . Conflict: Two former informants of the pseudo-religious Knights Templar are pictured in Michoacan state . Today, Alfredo Castillo, a special envoy of the Mexican government in the Knights Templar-controlled state of Michoacan, said the extraction and transportation of iron ore was now the cartel's biggest moneymaker. 'They are charging $15 (£9) [a . metric ton] for the process, from extraction to transport, processing, . storage, permits and finally export,' he told The Associated Press. It has long been known that Mexican cartels, such as the Knights Templar and its predecessor, La Familia, engage in other types of criminal . activity, such as the trafficking of people and pirated goods. But this is the first time the government has acknowledgement that a major organised . crime group has moved beyond drugs.

Making money: 'They are charging $15 (£9) [a metric ton] for the process, from extraction to transport, processing, storage, permits and finally export,' said Mr Castillo. Above, the Pacific port of Lazaro Cardenas . 'It is a criminal organisation like the mafia,' said Antonio Mazzitelli, the Mexico and Central America representative to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. 'La Familia, the Knights Templar and, in part, the new, smaller cartels that have developed, like the New Generation Jalisco, are copying this new typology.' Mexican authorities have counted at least . 12 major drug cartels now counting illegal mining, logging and extortion among their main sources of income - but also estimate there are a large number of . of smaller splinter groups. Taking cover: Since January, authorities have seized 119,000 tons of iron ore stored at several yards in Lazaro Cardenas and have taken over the farming hub of Apatzingan. Above, vigilantes in Michoacan . Lookout: This is the first time the government has officially acknowledged that a major organized crime group has moved beyond drugs. Above, members of community police patrol a highway near Paracuaro . And the implications of the move are . enormous - with organised crime in the general in Mexico standing to . diversify and become even more entrenched. Federal prosecutors have not seen similar shifts in other cartels, according to an Attorney General's Office official, who insisted on speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to speak about the topic. However, experts have disagreed - citing the Zetas cartel, with its strongholds along the U.S.-Mexico border, as among the first to change the business model from merely production and transport of drugs to migrant smuggling and controlling territory through terror. Drugs: The Knights Templar cartel has long been known for making money from the production and transportation of drugs, such as 'crystal meth' Though drugs still tops their list, the Zetas likely make as much from kidnapping and extortion, said Samuel Logan, director of Southern Pulse security consulting firm. 'I've never looked at [Mexican cartels] as drug-trafficking organizations,' he said. 'They are multinational corporations that will react to market pressures and do what they have to do to stay in business.' The pseudo-religious Knights Templar cartel has taken the model to another level - exploiting the main industries of the territory they control. Alonso Ancira, president of the National Chamber of the Iron and Steel, recently told local journalists that he estimated drug cartels earned $1billion (£600.75million) in profits from selling iron ore in 2013. The federal government has issued 900 concessions in Michoacan to mine iron ore, Mr Castillo said. In 2008, only 1.5 per cent of the iron ore exports to China went through the state's port of Lazaro Cardenas, but by 2012 nearly half of the exports to the Asian country were processed there. In relation to extortion, information from victims led government experts to estimate that the cartel earned $800,000 (£481,145) to $1.4 million (£842,000) a week just from that crime, he said. Many of the Knights Templar's extortion demands were made on Michoacan's lime and avocado producers, while the cartel even controlled the wholesale distribution center where prices were set and growers sell limes to the rest of the world. Former President Felipe Calderon warned against such a stranglehold when he first sent troops to Michoacan in late 2006 to fight La Familia, the predecessor of the Knights Templar. Clashes: Vigilantes armed with guns prevent members of the Knights Temper from escaping from Apatzingan . He said the cartel was trying to . infiltrate all levels of society - and by the time La Familia morphed into . the Knights Templar in 2010, it seemed to control the entire state, . including politicians and police who failed to act. More than seven years of military-style strikes failed to dislodge them, but the federal government was notably more successful after targeting the cartel's financial resources. It took over the port of Lazaro Cardenas in November and named Mr Castillo in January as a commissioner with special powers to try to clean up Michoacan. Violence: A man steals beer from a truck burning in a road block allegedly set up by fans of the Knights Templar . Since then, authorities have seized . 119,000 metric tons of iron ore stored at several yards in Lazaro . Cardenas, as well as liberating the wholesale lime center by taking . over the farming hub of Apatzingan. The government has also arrested or killed many of the cartel's leadership, but they did the same to La Familia, only to see the cartel remake itself into something even more menacing. Because of financial hits, the cartel is believed to now be struggling to pay informants and assassins. During its reign, the Knights Templar's hold was so tight that vigilante groups eventually formed and armed themselves to fight back. With fighting escalating between the cartel and the 'self-defense' groups, federal security forces finally moved in early this year. 'The Zetas, La Familia Michoacan, the Knights Templar are, for the most part, predators and parasites that become rejected by the communities,' Mr Mazzitelli said. The Knights Templar's reception contrasts with that of traditional drug-trafficking cartels, which typically generate jobs and wealth for local people - buying loyalty and protection. The classic example is the Sinaloa cartel, the only pure drug-trafficking organisation left in Mexico. The recent capture of its leader, Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman saw hundreds of locals line the streets to protest his arrest.","Knights Templar known for making money from drugs such as crystal meth .

Self-proclaimed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed claims the former Osama bin Laden spokesperson on trial had nothing to do with the 9/11 terror attacks. Mohammed claimed in a court filing Sunday that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was al Qaida's talking head because he was 'an eloquent, spellbinding speaker,' and nothing more. Abu Gaith, a bin Laden son-in-law, is on trial in a Manhattan federal court for conspiring to kill Americans. Former spokesperson: Abu Ghaith is charged with conspiring to kill Americans in his role as al-Qaida's flack after 9/11 . '[Abu Gaith] was not a military man and had nothing to do with military operations,' Mohammed explained.

He's been out of prison less than one year following his role in helping to mastermind Hollywood's notorious 'Bling Ring' burglaries, but Nick Prugo was again arrested on Friday for allegedly violating parole. According to TMZ, Prugo was seized by authorities in LA after police received information on him from skin specialist-to-the-stars Dawn DaLuise, who remains in custody for allegedly plotting a murder-for-hire scheme. DaLuise - a facialist who has counted Jennifer Aniston and Sarah Michelle Gellar as clients - is accused of hiring a former Detroit Lions player to kill a competitor of hers who had set up shop on the same street as her Santa Monica beauty salon, Skin Refinery. Following her arrest earlier this month, it emerged that DaLuise had sent text messages to a friend, Edward Feinstein, 28, saying she was setting up a fake Craigslist profile that would send strange to the home of her rival, Gabriel Suarez.

She was charged last week for solicitation to commit murder and is currently being held on $1 million bail. But during her police interrogation, she told police that Feinstein's housemate was Prugo, who had recently violated his parole by leaving the state.

'We didn't actually recover a body. We recovered just bones,' Lieutenant Jeff Hallock of the Orange County Sheriff's Department told KCal. Investigators haven't found any missing persons cases that match the description of the woman: a petite female aged at least 30 years with shoulder-length brown wavy hair with highlights and a distinctive gold bridge on her left jaw.

She may also have sustained a broken nose at some time in her life. 'Homicide, suicide, an accident - we don't have enough information to determine that,' Hallock said.

'She always said mom we need more hugs and I'd say Ana honey of course we do we need more hugs; she was a big hugger,' said Dinsmoor about her teenage girl who was shot dead on March 7 by her friend, Matthew Bolton, 15, who then took his own life.

Ana's mother Diannah Dinsmor spoke out as it emerged Bolton had made a series of threats against his ex-girlfriend, and Ana had gone the unnamed girl's house to protect her. When Bolton arrived at the home, Anastasia went out to confront him and was shot dead before he killed himself. Police say Ana had reported Bolton to school administrators on the day she was shot dead, saying he had threatened to beat up his former girlfriend. Officials at Sandra Day O'Connor High School contacted the parents of the girl Bolton is said to have threatened but because he was off school they were unable to speak to him.

'I trusted the school to do what they were supposed to do, that's what they were entrusted for. I put my daughter in their care for her to be safe,' she told My Fox Phoenix. Dinsmoor also denied claims that her daughter had been romantically involved with Bolton, saying the pair hadn't spoken for months. She admitted Bolton had bought her daughter a teddy bear last month, but said her daughter had not been allowed to date. Police say the gun used to kill Ana was taken from Bolton's brother, who kept it locked in his bedroom. Bolton is believed to have broken a window to get inside the room and get the gun.

Shannon Szabados, 27, is the first woman to play in the Southern Professional Hockey League after signing on as a goalie for the Columbus, Georgia Cottonmouths. While the Cottonmouths lost Saturday's game against the Knoxville Ice Bears 4-3, Szabados put on an impressive show saving a total of 27 shots.

When asked how her men's professional debut compared to the Olympic-winning game, Szabados said it was 'definitely up there'. 'I’ve been asked a lot whether this or the gold medal game was bigger. I’d have to say the gold medal game but here there was a little more excitement,' Szabados told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer. Good jog: While the Cottonmouths lost their game against Knoxville on Saturday 4-3, Szabados blocked an impressive 27 shots . Warm up: The Olympian admitted she felt a little rusty after not having practiced in a while. Saturday's game was one of the few times she's been on the ice since her Olympic victory on February 20 .

There for her: The 27-year-old says she enjoyed Saturday's game and even saw a few fans in the crows wearing her jersey . Szabados says she had fun at the game, and even saw a few spectators wearing shirts with her name. Cottonmouths coach Jerome Bechard gave his new goalie's first performance a positive review. 'I thought she played well,' Bechard said. 'She made the stops she was supposed to make.' Before Saturday's game, Bechard spoke with the New York Times about the new addition to his team and remarked on how it showed the hockey world was changing. 'I guess equal opportunity's the word. In my opinion, if you can play, it doesn't matter what color, what nationality, what gender you are,' Bechard told the Times. Gearing up: Szabados suits up next to male teammate Andy Willigar in the locker rooms . Watching her back: Szabados admits being a girl makes her a target on the ice . Szabados isn't the first female to play men's professional hockey, but she is the first to do so in the 10-year-old SPHL. Female hockey players have a hard time continuing their sport after college, since currently no women's professional league plays a living wage. No woman has ever played a regular-season game in the NHL, though Manon Rheaume played an exhibition game with Tampa Bay in 1992.

And at the age of 16, she became the first women to play in the Western Hockey League. Despite her  Olympic credentials, Szabados admits her gender is going to make her more of a target. 'I’m sure I’ll get run into quite a bit because that’s part of the men’s game,' Szabados told the Times. Still, Szabados has earned the respect of her fellow teammates who are excited to playing with a woman at the top of her game. Forward Matt Gingera, from Winnepeg, says he watched Szabados during the Olympic tournament and often wondered whether he would be able to get the puck past her.

The investigation to find Fronczak was re-opened last year after a DNA test proved a man long-believed to be the missing child, who was found abandoned in a stroller in New Jersey in 1965 and subsequently adopted by the Fronczak family, was not actually him. Adding to the uncanny resemblance, Miller also found a baby photo of Fronczak that looked just like he did as a child, ABC reported. Scroll down for video . Completely uncanny: Steve Miller (left) was shocked when he saw an age-progression image of what experts believe Paul Fronczak would look like today (right) The photo of Paul Fronczak taken the day he was born (right) has been the only image investigators have had of the stolen baby since he went missing in 1964. Steve Miller produced a photo of himself as a baby (left) which had a remarkable resemblance . Steve Miller described the moment he first saw the image of Paul Fronczak as 'ghostly' 'We all just stood there in shock,' Miller told ABC News after seeing the image. 'I look like that guy and I have no idea where I came from.' Miller, a Microsoft executive, grew up in a suburb outside Chicago but did not learn he was adopted until earlier this year after doctors told him his kidney disease, which he has battled for years, had taken a serious turn for the worse. He called a cousin for information about the family's medical history. The cousin told him he was adopted and that there was no such history of kidney disease in their family. Miller, who is married with two children, has end-stage renal disease and finding his real family has become a life-threatening issue. 'So here I am. And I hope that I'm able to find a kidney, find my family and go on with my life,' Miller said. 'Because I'm kind of near the end.' Pleading: Chester and Dora Fronczak made a televised appeal to return their baby boy. 'I don't think you're that desperate to come and take another woman's baby,' Dora said. The couple are now in their 80s . Where is he? The FBI fielded 10,000 babies in their search for Paul Fronczak, but still couldn't find the missing boy . As their own: Dora Fronczak reportedly said 'That's my baby' when she saw Paul. Nearly five decades later, it was revealed that Paul belongs to a different family . Unfortunately, original adoption papers obtained from a government office in Chicago proved that Miller was not Paul Fronczak. 'I have a brand new search,' he said. Chester and Dora Fronczak only discovered last year that the baby they took in believing to be their long-lost son was not actually related to them at all. It was one year after the child had gone missing that the baby, who they adopted and named Paul Fronczak, was found abandoned in a stroller on a street in Newark, New Jersey. In a major TV interview with Barbara Walters, Paul Fronczak, 49, revealed the results of the DNA test he had undergone. The search continues: Paul Fronczak spoke with ABC's . Barbara Walters in August about his hunt to find his parent's real . biological child, who was stolen from the hospital in 1964 . 'My main goal for this entire project is to find the real Paul,' he told ABC. 'My parents raised me and they did a great job and I feel that if I don't do everything I can to help find their real child - then I'm not doing my job as a son.' ABC then started a 20/20 investigation to find the real Paul Fronczak - as did police - which is how Miller came to see the age-progression images. The case continues.

A dachshund that took on a bull mastiff as it dragged a terrified 11-year-old girl down the street by her arm paid for its bravery with its life. Police in the northern Serbian town of Pancevo said that the mastiff which is normally kept in a cage had managed to escape when the owner was away. It had run into the street where it then attacked a girl playing on her roller skates, biting her arms and legs and dragging her back to its cage. Hero: Eleven-year-old Sofia holds a picture of Leo the Dachshund who saved her life but lost his when the dog intervened while she was being attacked by an escaped bull mastiff in Serbia . As she screamed for help, a man was . walking nearby with his dachshund named Leo, which ran over and bit the mastiff on . the leg, sparking a fight between the animals. Leo was fatally wounded, but his intervention had allowed the girl, named Sofia Vucetic, to escape unharmed. Eyewitness Milica Panajotovic, 35, said: 'The girl spotted the dog running towards her because it was barking, but she had no chance to get away, and it knocked her flying. 'It then grabbed her arms and legs and was biting her and then started to drag her by the arm back to its cage. 'I was just struck dumb and unable to move, and there was a man walking his Dachshund as well who seemed frozen to the spot. 'But his dog which was off the lead when it saw what was happening ran over and started barking at the bigger dog, and then tried to bite it on the leg. 'This distracted the mastiff that turned round and started fighting with the dachshund. Of course it wasn't a very even battle and the Dachshund was badly wounded. Tribute: Neighbours now say they want to put up a memorial to Leo to honour his bravery . 'But the child managed to get away from the mastiff while it was attacking the Dachshund.' As other witnesses appeared a couple took the child to safety while three men grabbed sticks and used them to drive off the mastiff. They managed to rescue Leo, but he was badly hurt and even though a vet was called and an emergency operation carried out he was unable to do anything to save the dog. Its owner said he had named the dog Leo because although it was tiny it had never been afraid of anything and had a heart as big as a lion. Leo's owner said: 'Everybody loved Leo, he was so kind and playful. We will miss him terribly, but will always remember he saved a child's life. He really is a hero dog. He will never be forgotten. Sofia's mother . 'He was a really laid back dachshund, but he obviously saw the child was in danger and his natural hunting instinct kicked in and he went to attack the other dog to save the girl.' The injured girl's mother said: 'My daughter Sofia was very scared and traumatised. Her left hand was all bitten. It was horrible. 'She was very shaken up. The dog pulled her around like a rag doll, banging her around. 'I can only imagine what could have happened if that little dog was not that brave. We were praying for the dog. He saved our daughter's life.' Neighbours now say they want to put up a memorial to Leo so people remember the dog's bravery which ultimately led to the child's life being saved. One said: 'We want to make sure the dog is honoured. If the dog had not jumped to the rescue the little girl could have been killed. The child has been released from hospital and is now recovering at home. Police confirmed they are investigating the incident. Dachshunds are known to be playful, but as hunting dogs they can be quite stubborn, and are known for their propensity for chasing small animals, birds, and tennis balls with great determination and ferocity.","Bull mastiff mauled girl's arms and legs after escaping from its cage .

A Russian mother convinced she had been given the wrong baby at a hospital is suing health officials after she finally managed to organise a DNA test - and discovered her suspicion was correct. Flera Fazlyeva, 54, from the city of Kazan in the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, gave birth at hospital where her son was accidentally swapped with another baby boy born around the same time in 1986. After discovering the truth, Ms Fazlyeva contacted Razia Fakarova who had been given her son by mistake. But tragically, Ms Fazlyeva found that her real son, who had been named Aidar, had died in 2004 in a car accident when he was 18. Tragic ending: Flera Fazlyeva, 54, (pictured left) discovered her son had been swapped at birth  after 27 years. When she tracked down her biological son, Aidar, (pictured right) she discovered he had already died in a car accident in 2004 when he was 18 . Complex relationship: The other mother, Razia Fakarova, (pictured right) is now trying to build a relationship with her biological son Illshat (pictured left) She said: 'I was at the hospital on July 3, 1986. I knew as soon as they put the baby in my arms that something was not right. 'I told them then that they had given me the wrong baby and refused to take it, but then a nurse and a doctor came to me and explained to me that it was impossible, as the baby had been given a special tag right after birth. 'They pointed out that tag and told me it was just because I was tired after the ordeal of giving birth. They said that the baby and I would eventually bond. 'I couldn't shake off the feeling though, and my family didn't believe me either. We had a meeting where we decided that as we couldn't afford any medical test to check if my feeling was right, I would have to accept the baby, and I raised him as my own. 'By the time I learned about the possibility of a postal DNA test and that we could afford it, it did not give me any satisfaction when it confirmed my suspicions, and it didn't give me back my real son. Razia Fakarova, 56, admits it has been difficult to come to terms with knowing the son she buried, Aidar (pictured left as a child and right when he was a teenager), was not actually her own child . Joint battle: Both Flera Fazlyeva (pictured left) and Razia Fakarova (pictured right) are suing over the mistake. If successful, they plan to buy a house with the compensation money so their families can live together . 'In fact, it took years of pressure for . me to track down the mother of my boy. I couldn't believe it when she . told me that Aidar had died in 2004.' The son she had raised, Ilshat, now aged 27, has now met his real mother but said he did not feel any emotional connection to her. He admits he now feels lost and confused about the whole saga. He said: 'I always felt as if my mother who raised me was distant in some way, although she always did her best for me. Yet now I know that my real mother was someone else I don't feel that connection to her.' Razia Fakarova, 56, the biological mother of Ilshat, added: 'I lost my son and I buried him but with this bizarre twist I then found that actually it wasn't even my son I buried - but then I was presented with a stranger and they are telling me this is my boy. Mixed feelings: Illshat (pictured right) admits he does not yet feel any emotional connection to his biological mother Razia (pictured left) Experts believe the families are unlikely to win their legal battle because of the length of time that has passed since the error was made . 'It is very difficult for all of us, the young man who is my son is certainly not warm towards me but I can't blame him for that. At best I get a lukewarm hello, and he has never called me mum like Aidaz used to.' Both women are now suing over the error for more than one million rubles (£16,400) in compensation and plan to buy a house where they can live together if successful. But experts say they are unlikely to win because of the length of time that has passed since the original mistake took place. According to Russian law, compensation payments incidents like this are only available for incidents that happened after 1991 when a new compensation law came into effect. But with the switch having happened in 1986, compensation is only possible if those responsible are still alive and are actively obstructing those who are harmed. But the hospital say that in their case this is not so, and they are doing all they can to put matters right, although that does not include paying compensation.","Flera Fazlyeva's son was switched with another baby at a hospital in 1986 .

The black-furred bear, a female named Winnipeg, was smuggled in Britain during the First World War by Canadian lieutenant, Harry Colebourn. After the soldier was sent to fight in France, the bear cub was given to London Zoo, where it was watched and loved by AA Milne's son, the real-life Christopher Robin.

Lieutenant Colebourn (left) gave the bear to London Zoo, where it was seen by AA Milne's son Christopher Robin (right) Colebourn was among troops traveling through Canada on his way to warring Europe in 1914, when he saw the bear for sale in White River, Ontario. It is believed he bought the cub for just £12 from a hunter who had killed the creature's mother. He called it Winnipeg after his home city in Manitoba, central Canada. The soldier then sneaked the bear into Britain and it became an unofficial mascot for his regiment, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade, who trained on the Salisbury Plain.

When Lieutenant Colebourn was transferred to France, he gave the bear to London zoo, where it became a popular attraction and lived until 1934. It was while the Canadian black bear was being exhibited at the zoo that AA Milne's son, Christopher Robin, observed her playfulness and decided to change the name of his teddy bear from ""Edward Bear"" to ""Winnie the Pooh."" This name change provided the inspiration for Milne's stories about Winnie-the-Pooh - a character who first appeared in 1924, 10 years after Colebourn brought the bear to England. The pictures were released ahead of what would have been the original bear's 100th birthday this year.

Republican Senator John McCain labeled Russia as nothing but a 'gas station masquerading as a country' in a television appearance Sunday where he called out president Obama's 'disturbing lack of realism' in dealing with the crisis in Crimea. Just back from a visit to Ukraine, McCain urged the Obama administration to do more. He called for military assistance to Ukraine, resumption of development of a U.S. missile defense system for Eastern Europe and steps toward NATO membership for Georgia and Moldova. 'The United States of America has to first of all have a fundamental reassessment of our relationship with Vladimir Putin. No more 'reset' button,' McCain told CNN's State of the Union. Offensive: Senator John McCain appeared on CNN Sunday after a trip Kiev. He blasted Russia as weak and vulnerable and suggested the Obama's worldview has shrunken America's place on the world stage . The senator referred to Obama's focused outreach to Russia early in his first term that has since been abandoned. 'Treat him for what he is,' McCain said, referring to Putin. 'That does not mean re-ignition of the Cold War. But it does mean treating him in the way that we understand an individual who believes in restoring the old Russian empire.' Much of his argument dealt with Russia's reliance on fossil fuels to drive its economy. 'Russia is a gas station masquerading as a country,' McCain told Candy Crowley. 'It's kleptocracy, it's corruption, it's a nation that's really only dependent upon oil and gas for their economy.' McCain urged the Obama administration to use that reliance to pressure Russia out of Ukraine using economic sanctions. He also went a step further to suggest sending in 'some military assistance to Ukrainians.' Demands: McCain's CNN appearance came just after his return from a trip to Ukraine, where he spoke with fellow senators (at rear is Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois) on Saturday and called for military aid to be sent to the region . 'At least so they can defend themselves,' McCain argued. 'Resume the missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Look at Moldova and Georgia, both of whom are occupied by Russian troops as we speak, a path toward membership in NATO.' While in Kiev over the weekend, McCain urged a group of fellow senators to help get both 'lethal and non-lethal' military equiment to Ukraine, calling it 'the right and decent thing to do.' As they sat powerless while Crimeans voted to unite with Russia, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said the right thing is exactly what the White House is trying to do. 'We are putting as much pressure on the Russians as we can to do the right thing,' he said Sunday. Pfeiffer insisted the United States would not recognize the results of the referendum and said the administration was working with European partners to step up pressure on Russia in the worst East-West standoff since the Cold War. Crimea's pro-Russian regional government went ahead with the referendum despite U.S. and European threats against Moscow. 'You can expect sanctions designations in the coming days,' Pfeiffer told NBC's Meet the Press, as the administration prepares to identify Russians whom the United States will seek to punish with visa bans and asset freezes the president authorized last week. While the United States and its allies essentially have ruled out military action, Pfeiffer sidestepped the question of whether Washington would provide military aid to Ukraine's interim government, which has accused Russia of violating its sovereignty over Crimea. 'We're looking at all ways of assistance,' Pfeiffer said. White House response: Also on Sunday, senior White House official Dan Pfeiffer appeared on NBC's Meet the Press and said the U.S. intends to apply pressure through sanctions and other means in order to 'do the right thing'","The Republican from Arizona appeared on CNN's State of the Union Sunday as Crimeans lined up to vote on rejoining Russia .

If it isn't fermented in Tennessee from mash of at least 51 percent corn, aged in new charred oak barrels, filtered through maple charcoal and bottled at a minimum of 80 proof, it isn't Tennessee whiskey. So says a year-old law that resembles almost to the letter the process used to make Jack Daniel's, the world's best-known Tennessee whiskey. Now state lawmakers are considering dialing back some of those requirements that they say make it too difficult for craft distilleries to market their spirits as Tennessee whiskey, a distinctive and popular draw in the booming American liquor business. Made to exact proportions:  If it isn't fermented in Tennessee from mash of at least 51 percent corn, aged in new charred oak barrels, filtered through maple charcoal and bottled at a minimum of 80 proof, it isn't Tennessee whiskey . But the people behind Jack Daniel's see the hand of a bigger competitor at work — Diageo PLC, the British conglomerate that owns George Dickel, another Tennessee whiskey made about 15 miles up the road. 'It's really more to weaken a title on a label that we've worked very hard for,' said Jeff Arnett, the master distiller at the Jack Daniel's distillery in Lynchburg, Tenn. 'As a state, I don't think Tennessee should be bashful about being protective of Tennessee whiskey over say bourbon or scotch or any of the other products that we compete with.' Republican state Rep. Bill Sanderson emphasized that his bill wouldn't do away with last year's law enacted largely on the behest of Jack Daniel's corporate parent, Louisville, Ky.,-based Brown-Forman Corp. The principal change would be to allow Tennessee whiskey makers to reuse barrels, which he said would present considerable savings over new ones that can cost $600 each. 'There are a lot of ways to make high-quality whiskey, even if it's not necessarily the way Jack Daniel's does it,' Sanderson said. 'What gives them the right to call theirs Tennessee whiskey, and not others?' Sanderson acknowledged that he introduced the measure at Diageo's urging, but said it would also help micro distilleries opening across the state. Diageo picked up on the same theme. 'This isn't about Diageo, as all of our Tennessee whiskey is made with new oak,' said Diageo executive vice president Guy L. Smith IV. 'This is about Brown-Forman trying to stifle competition and the entrepreneurial spirit of micro distillers. 'We are not sure what they are afraid of, as we feel new innovative products from a new breed of distillers is healthy for the entire industry,' he said. Special blend: Jeff Arnett, the master distiller at the Jack Daniel Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee tests the aroma of whiskey at the distillery. Jack Daniel's is fighting efforts in the state Legislature to dial back the legal definition of Tennessee whiskey, including a provision that requires the spirit to be aged in new oak barrels . Jack Daniel's last year sold 11.5 million cases of it Black Label last year, a 5 percent increase from 2012. Dickel, the second-largest Tennessee whiskey producer, sold 130,000 cases in 2013. The standards and special branding of Tennessee whiskey are an outgrowth of the special designation granted long ago to bourbon. A half-century ago, Congress declared bourbon a distinctive product of the United States. By law, bourbon must be made of a grain mix of at least 51 percent corn, distilled at less than 160 proof, have no additives except water to reduce the proof and be aged in new, charred white oak barrels. Spirits that don't follow those guidelines can't be sold as bourbon. One example is Brown-Forman's own Early Times, which is marketed as a 'Kentucky whisky' because it is made in reused barrels. Billy Kaufman, the president Short Mountain Distillery in Woodbury, Tenn., said it is more difficult to distinguish spirits not meeting the Tennessee standard. 'If I made whiskey in Tennessee in a used barrel, what it would be called then?' he said. 'Whiskey, made in Tennessee?' David McMahan, a lobbyist representing Dickel and Popcorn Sutton Distilling, said the law passed last year would require all Tennessee whiskies to taste like Jack Daniel's. Preparing to fight: A law that was introduced last year says the whiskey must be made in a way that resembles almost to the letter the process used to make Jack Daniel's . 'It's not unlike if the beer guys 25 years ago had said all American beer has to be made like Budweiser,' McMahan said. 'You never would have a Sam Adams or a Yazoo or any of those guys.' But Tennessee craft distillers are divided about the state law. Charles Nelson, the CEO of Nelson's Green Brier Distillery in Nashville, said he supports tighter regulation. 'Holding ourselves to a higher standard will ultimately be better for all the people in the category,' he said. 'If we lower the standards, it could lead to more products and brands that could lower the reputation of Tennessee whiskey.' Whiskey is clear when it goes into the barrel. It's during the aging process that the whiskey acquires color and flavors. Jack Daniel's Arnett said other distillers reusing barrels might resort to using artificial colorings and flavorings that wouldn't match the quality of the whiskey stored in new barrels. 'We've been making whiskey a long time, and we know that would not uphold the quality that people expect from Tennessee whiskey,' he said. 'So we wouldn't dare consider doing it, even though it would save us millions of dollars every year.' Change in the law? Lawmakers are looking at amending that law so that some of the craft distillers that have sprung up in recent years can label their products Tennessee whiskey, a distinctive and popular draw in the booming American liquor business. The people behind Jack Daniel's see the hand of a bigger rival at work, however, the foreign-owned conglomerate that makes George Dickel, another famed Tennessee brand . Jack Daniel's stores its whiskey in new barrels made at a Brown-Forman plant. Sanderson argues that the flavor and color of the whiskey is determined more by the charring of the inside of the barrels, which he said is a process that can be repeated. Consumers would ultimately decide whether the end product matches up. 'If they're making an inferior product, the market will decide,' he said.","Distilleries in Tennessee want to change a year-old law that states Tennessee Whiskey must be made a certain way .

This video of a boy called Gavin, from Matthews North Carolina, giving up on his favorite American football team, The Carolina Panthers, after they fire his hero Steve Smith, has gone viral. In a moment of fury, Gavin says: 'I hate the Panthers' whilst attempting to hit the camera that his dad, Matt Simone, has used to video him crying. Scroll down for video . 'I hate The Panthers' bursts out little Gavin after NFL player Steve Smith leaves the team . Gavin's dad starts the video by taunting his son, telling him: 'The Panthers said that they didn't even want him on the team anymore - so they fired him' The video, which was uploaded last Thursday before being posted on CBS, tracks the moment that Gavin finds out that wide receiver Steve Smith is no longer with the Carolina Panthers and has moved to the Baltimore Ravens. Gavin's dad starts the video by telling his son: 'The Panthers said that they didn't even want him on the team anymore - so they fired him.' Gavin's little sister, Sophia, asks: 'Why did they fire him daddy?' Mr Simone replies: 'Because they said he was too old to play.' He then sums it up by saying: 'So now we can't cheer for Steve Smith anymore.' Sister Sophia says: 'So now we have to cheer for Cam Newton.' The taunts become too much for little Gavin who breaks down in tears and hits his head against the car's seat. When his dad says: 'Who are we going to cheer for on Sunday's now?' Gavin howls out 'Nobody'. But the heartache does not stop there, Gavin then covers his face in despair and says: 'I don't even want to watch The Panthers, I hate The Panthers.'

Busted: Joseph Minoglio, 19, has been charged with stabbing his grandparents to death in their Maryland home . Authorities say the teen stabbed the pair to death before 6.00pm Saturday and skipped town. The bodies were found in two separate downstairs rooms, Washington County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Carly Hose told the Herald-Mail. The senior Joseph MInoglio was stabbed at least 15 times, she added. A knife believed to have been used in the killings was recovered inside the home, Hose noted. It is not clear who discovered the bodies or called 911, but police said the couple was well-liked. ‘I know they were loved and well-known in the community,’ said Close. ‘And this has definitely sent shock waves throughout the [community],’ she added. ‘A lot of people ... knew this family.’ No motive has yet been established in the grisly murders.

The parents of a Japanese girl who was abducted by North Korea met their granddaughter for the first time, 35 years after she was snatched. The Japanese Foreign Ministry said that Megumi Yokota's parents spent several days with their granddaughter, Kim Eun Gyong, in the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator. Ulan Bator is often used as a Japanese and North Korean official meeting point for unofficial contacts. Scroll down for video . Gone: Megumi Yokota disappeared from her hometown in Japan in 1977 at the age of 13 . North Korea abducted Yokota in 1977 on her way home from school at the age of 13, and was declared dead in 2002, among admissions by North Korea that in the 1970s and 1980s they abducted 13 Japanese nationals in order to help them train spies. Now her parents, Shigeru and Sakie, have finally met their granddaughter, whose father is a South Korean man, also abducted by North Korea. North Korea also said that eight of the 13 abducted Japanese nationals had died, including Yokota. Japan has never accepted the explanation of Megumi Yokota's death, saying that bones North Korea supplied as Yokota's remains were actually those of a man, after comprehensive DNA testing. Japan has suspected for years that there are even more unsolved abduction cases that North Korea has not disclosed, and the issue has held back a normal relationship between the two countries. Agony: Mr and Mrs Yokota discovered 25 years later that their daughter had been kidnapped by North Korea . Family: Megumi, centre, with her parents Shigeru and Sakie, and younger brother Tetsuya and Takuya . Japan has always demanded more information about the abductees taken to North Korea, while the totalitarian country has said the case is closed. Japanâ€™s Kyodo news agency said the Foreign Ministry 'embraced the meeting as a positive development and plans to seek the reopening of intergovernmental talks' between Japan and North Korea. The news followed official talks between Japan and North Korean Red Cross affiliates about the return of remaining Japanese nationals from North Korea. Alive: Megumi is pictured in North Korea as a young adult; the authorities claim that she has since died . Formal talks between the two countries have been suspended since North Korea launched a rocket in 2012, which they said was to put a weather satellite into orbit. However, many other countries, including the U.S, South Korea and Japan believe the launch was a nuclear technology test, in their plans to create a missile that could one day place a warhead as far away as the United States.","North Korea admitted to Megumi Yokota's 1977 kidnapping in 2002 .

We may like to remember wartime Britons as upstanding, moral folk ruled by the stiff upper lip. But a new letter shows that, when it came to celebrating at least, they were every bit as debauched as their modern-day equivalents. Penned after the VE Day celebrations in London, Diana Carnegie's letter describes how couples were openly having sex outside Buckingham Palace as the King and Queen walked out on to the balcony. Newsreel footage from the time may show the VE celebrations as refined, but a new letter reveals that couples were openly having sex outside Buckingham Palace as the King and Queen took to the balcony . Diana Carnegie, who wrote the letter to her officer husband, also describes how the drunken crowd booed 'boring' members of the cabinet and instead demanded to see Winston Churchill . London's streets were turned into a festival ground as revellers poured on to the street to mark the end of the Second World War in Europe. This picture shows Trafalgar Square . Diana Carnegie recorded how drunken crowds along Whitehall booed speeches by boring members of the cabinet before demanding to see Winston Churchill. After downing rum and whisky, Diana and her friends joined the jubilant throngs to see Churchill give his famous V for victory salute. And in her letter to her army officer husband who was away in Europe, she wrote how she ‘ached’ for him and that they would have ‘gone wild and never stopped’ had he been there. Mrs Carnegie’s account of VE Day is a far cry from the mild, traditional newsreel footage of the event in May 1945. It is now coming up for sale at auction in an archive relating to her husband James Carnegie, whose father was Sir Lancelot Carnegie, the son of an Earl and a former ambassador of Portugal. At the end of World War II, James Carnegie was in Germany with the Royal Artillery, leaving his wife and her friends to celebrate at home in London. In her letter, Diana describes drinking a bottle of whiskey with friends (left) before they had 'quite a good dinner' and then 'stumbled across f*****g couples to the palace where the King and Queen had just been out' (right) Mrs Carnegie wrote how the group went to the Athenaeum Hotel in Piccadilly for dinner on May 8, 1945 where they had a ‘set-to’ with staff about being allowed in. She said: 'Eventually they let us all have a rum and orange. We had quite a good dinner and then stumbled across f******g couples in the dark to the Palace where the King and Queen had just been out. 'We decided to go to Whitehall in the hopes of seeing Churchill. The crowds were terrific but we managed to make our way behind a string of sailors. 'Parliament Square was a seething mass.

Celebrations lasted throughout the day and into the night, but the war continued for another three months . 'At that moment (Clement) Atlee (deputy Prime Minister) and co appeared on the balcony so we made a dash and got right in front of the crowd and immediately underneath him. 'We cheered suitably at all points of his ridiculous and boring speech at the same time mentioning we’d like to see Churchill.' Mrs Carnegie then said how her friends nearly got into a fight with a man who called Churchill a ‘drunk who didn’t give a damn.’ She added: 'That got our blood up and when Atlee had finished (Ernest) Bevin (minister for labour and national service) looking like a revolting gargoyle came to the mike to speak - so we just yelled ""we want Churchill"" non-stop. 'Quite a lot of the crowd took it up and he never got a word out and had to retire! We were terribly pleased with ourselves.' In the note Diana describes the moment she and her friends jeered one cabinet minister off the balcony of the Palace with chants of 'we want Churchill' (left), before telling her husband she 'ached' for him to be there (right) With her spirits up, Mrs Carnegie described how she returned home alone and midnight. She said: 'Oh darling, you can imagine how I ached for you to be there, it would have been marvellous. 'We’d have gone wild together and never stopped.' The letter is being sold by Mullocks Auctioneers of Ludlow, Shrops. Auctioneer Richard Westwood-Brookes said: 'This letter certainly gives a vivid account of what the VE Day celebrations were like and is in contrast to the traditional news footage from the time. 'She makes it clear that there were couples openly having sex outside Buckingham Palace without caring who was watching.

Night-time tryst: A soldier is caught in a searchlight along with a woman during the victory celebrations . 'Somewhat surprsingly for a refined lady in 1945, she used very colourful language and behaved in a very raucous manner. 'Giving a speech to thousands of people would have been one of Bevin’s greatest moments in his career but it never happened because of this lady and her friends.'

An elderly man who has raised pigs for 30 years has been seen riding his pig around streets and towns in China, after becoming too sick to walk. The 68-year-old pig farmer from Chongqing in China rides a hog which weighs 250 kg and stands at about 3 feet tall. He started riding it when an attack of bronchitis made him too sick to walk, which made him attempt to ride the pig. The 68-year-old swineherd rides a massive pig around the streets . The elderly man rides the massive pig ever since an illness made him too sick to walk . The man has herded pigs for 30 years, and is commonly known as a 'swineherd', an older term for pig farmer that has disappeared into obscurity with the passing of time. He was originally skeptical that his idea would pay off, but after giving it a go, he found that it was a lot smoother than he thought it would be. After his realisation, he started riding the pig everywhere, from his house to market, to around the town. After a nasty bout of bronchitis, the swineherd toyed with the idea of riding the pig, which turned out to be a much smoother ride than he thought it would be . The man and his hog have become a slight celebrity sight in the town of Chongqing in China . China is the world’s largest pork consumer and half of the world’s pigs – nearly 480 million – are kept there. Last year the US’s largest pork producing company, Smithfields Farms, was bought by a Chinese company for £4.2billion. Refuelling: The pig munches on some lettuce to get more energy to carry its rider a little further . The pig is so massive, weighing around 250 kg, that the riders feet don't even touch the ground when he travels on it . The man can be seen in all weathers, donning an umbrella when the weather would cause most to travel via car. Thanks to the pig being a sustainable vehicle, all he needs to keep going is a little bit of fuel for the pig in the form of some lettuce or scraps. A smooth ride: The pigs furry hide doubtless make it very comfortable, as the farmer raises a few eyebrows travelling down the roads . The pig is doubtless much cheaper than a car, as all it takes is some food rather than expensive petrol . This probably makes the pig far cheaper than a regular vehicle, and much more eco-friendly. While the 68-year old is able to walk, he much prefers riding his hog around town. The man seems incredibly jovial as he rides his pig, which has given him back the ability to travel around after his sickness . While the elderly man has recovered following his sickness and is able to walk short distances, he seems to much prefer using his pig to get around .","Man started riding pig after batch of bronchitis left him too sick .

A female drama teacher had her relationship with a 16-year-old pupil discovered when the pair were caught visiting a sexual health clinic together. Kelly Ann-Marie Burgess, from Newport in Gwent, admitted four counts of adult breach of trust and sexual activity with a boy aged 16 and 17 at North Somerset Courthouse in Weston-super-Mare this morning. The court heard how the 26-year-old's offences were exposed when the victim told a nurse at a sexual health clinic that he was in a sexual relationship with a teacher. The offences took place at a school in north Somerset where Burgess was in a 'position of trust' in relation to the boy. She sexually touched the teenager, 'not reasonably believing he was aged 18 or over', charges state. Prosecuting, Michael Collins told magistrates: 'The defendant and the child had attended a sexual health clinic where the child made some revelations to the practice nurse that he was or had been in a sexual relationship with a 25-year-old teacher and mentioned the defendant by name.' 'The practice nurse explained that this caused her obvious concerns and there was a protocol which may mean she might need to make a referral in relation to this.' Mr Collins said the child left the room and returned with the defendant, who provided a false name to the nurse. A police investigation began and Burgess was arrested on August 28. Police carried out a search at the teacher's home and her mobile phone was seized. Mr Collins said the phone received a text message from the boy while en route to the police station. The text read: 'Got the police round. Don't text back, don't be scared.' 'Just get the story straight for when they come for you.' Denial: Burgess (pictured) initially claimed she accompanied the victim to the sexual health clinic after he had a relationship with a girl of the same age . Court: Kelly Ann-Marie Burgess, from Newport in Gwent, admitted four counts of adult breach of trust and sexual activity with a boy aged 16 and 17 at North Somerset Courthouse (pictured) this morning . Message: While investigating, police carried out a search at Kelly Burgess' home and her mobile phone was seized. The court heard the phone received a text message from the boy while en route to the police station . Burgess initially denied she was involved with the boy and claimed she had accompanied him to the sexual health clinic after a relationship between him and a girl of the same age. Officers then discovered back-ups of deleted files from Burgess's phone on her work station, Mr Collins said. 'She was interviewed again. She confirmed they had begun a relationship in January,' the prosecutor said. 'She stated she wasn't aware there was anything illegal because, as far as she was concerned, he had reached the age of consent.' Mr Collins said the sentencing point for the charges started at 18 months and therefore the case should be sent to Bristol Crown Court. Representing Burgess, Sue Cameron said: 'We are not opposed to the matter being sent to the Crown Court for sentence.' 'There are mitigating factors that I won't go into today.' Mrs Jane Corke, chair of magistrates, adjourned the case for sentencing. 'Kelly Burgess, having considered and heard the facts in this case, it clearly deserves more punishment than we are able to give,' she said. Kelly Ann-Marie Burgess' offences were exposed when the pair attended a sexual health clinic together . Sacked: A spokeswoman for North Somerset Council said Kelly Burgess had now lost her job at the school . 'We are therefore committing you to the crown court at Bristol...Until then you are being given unconditional bail.' Burgess will next appear at Bristol Crown Court on April 7. A spokeswoman for North Somerset Council said Burgess had lost her job at the school where she worked. 'The school takes safeguarding issues very seriously and this was an isolated incident,' the spokeswoman said. 'The individual teacher abused her position of trust. The school followed the correct procedures and has co-operated fully with the police.

An Upstate New York mom is fighting for her life after she was diagnosed with a rare pregnancy-related cancer following the premature birth of her twins daughters. Jenna Hinman, 26, was rushed to hospital on March 3 when all of a sudden she couldn't breathe and her husband, US Army Sgt. Brandon Hinman, called 911. Doctors quickly decided she needed an emergency C-section to deliver the girls, Kinleigh and Azlynn, who were nine weeks early and weighed just 3 pounds each. Tragic: Jenna Hinman, 26, pictured, is fighting for her life with a rare form of cancer . Emergency: After Jenna struggled to breathe, doctors delivered her daughters, pictured, by emergency C-section. They were nine weeks early and weighed just 3 pounds each . Because of their health, Jenna was able to get just a quick glimpse of her newborns before they were whisked away to NICU at Crouse Hospital in Syracuse where they'd all been transferred. But that was the only time she saw them. Soon after delivery, the young mom began coughing up blood and her breathing troubles got worse. Doctors initially thought she had pneumonia, but she was later diagnosed with a rare cancer called choriocarcinoma, which has filled her body with tumors and lesions. On March 6, she was placed in a medically induced coma and Brandon, who is based at Fort Drum, is supporting her tirelessly as a team of local and international doctors try to save her life.

Coma: On March 6, Jenna, pictured left and right, was placed in a medically induced coma and Brandon, who is based at Fort Drum, is supporting her tirelessly as a team of local and international doctors try to save her life . 'Her lungs are so involved with tumor that they don't work. And right now they're not working at all,' Crouse Hospital oncologist Dr. Wiley Bunn told cnycentral.com. According to the family's message on a Go Fund Me page where they have raised more than $57,000 for treatment, a chest infection has caused internal bleeding to the point Jenna's lungs don't work. She is receiving heavy doses of chemotherapy and an ECMO machine, which costs around $100,000 a day to run, is removing blood from her body, oxygenating it and pumping it back through her veins.

Hoping: 'My hope is that my wife stands up, holds my hand, we have the girls and we walk out of this hospital,' Brandon, left, said of his wife, right . The cancer forms in the placenta but spreads quickly. It is seen in fewer than one in 160,000 cases, Bunn said. Jenna's condition has been touch and go from the start but, last week, she woke up briefly. 'I walked up to her bed and grabbed her hand and said ""honey it's me. I love you, you're doing great."" And as I was talking she shook her head yes,' Brandon told cnycentral. 'That could be the last time I talk to my wife.' In the meantime, the military man is splitting his time between his wife's bedside and NCIU, playing mom and dad to the couple's daughters. 'My hope is that my wife stands up, holds my hand, we have the girls and we walk out of this hospital,' he said.","Jenna Hinman, 26, from Upstate new York, was rushed to hospital on March 3 when all of a sudden she couldn't breathe .

The solution? Get a chainsaw. A truck rumbles along a frozen highway, and as it passes an icy breeze loosens the snow on the side bank to reveal a pair of human nostrils protruding from the drift. Soothing piped music is playing as a man pushing a shopping trolley along the aisle of a hardware store throws in his purchases: an axe, duct tape, a crow bar, a hunting knife, boxes of ammunition, and a rifle bag. Fargo teaser: Two men struggle with a sack out on a windswept frozen lake until one protests, in deaf sign language, that the hole in the ice is too small, and the other grasps the leg of the body protruding from the bag and signs, 'guy's too fat' Looks familiar: the booted foot which is presumably connected to a body which the two men in the frozen mid-west of northers US cannot fit through a hole in the ice, a problem they solve in the teaser's final scene with a chainsaw, a cinematic nod to the original film's woodchipper scene . Retail therapy: Soothing piped music is playing in this video teaser for the new Fargo TV series which shows a man pushing a shopping trolley along the aisle of a hardware store and throwing in his purchases, an axe, duct tape, a crow bar, a hunting knife, boxes of ammunition and a large rifle bag . In another teaser video for the upcoming new TV series based on the 1996 hit film Fargo, Billy Bob Thornton attacks the windscreen of his car with an ice scraper. Yes, the Coen brothers are back with their dark comedy set in the tundras of a Minnesota winter, and the clever series of videos - with no dialogue and grisly, suggestive scenes - would seem to indicate audiences are in for. Joel and Ethan Coen directed the original film, which starred William H Macy as the struggling car salesman Jerry Lundergaard, who hires two hitmen to kidnap his wife. The film also stars Joel Coen's real-life wife Frances McDormand, as pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson, who investigates three local homicides. The Coens acted as producers of the new ten-episode TV series, which was developed by screenwriter Noah Hawley (Bones),and stars Martin Freeman as Lester Nygaard, a man who has his life drastically changed when he encounters a mysterious man who arrives in town. Billy Bob Thornton, a Coen brothers favourite, plays Lorne Malvo, a boastful and manipulative crook who FBI agents Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are obsessed with tracking down. In one of the teasers, the scene where the 'fishermen' who speak sign language as they attempt to stuff a body down an ice hole, would seem to reference the famous scene in the original film when Marge happens upon one of the hit men feeding the body of the other into a woodchipper. Nose in the snow: in the scene much like the original film's opener, a truck rumbles along an icy highway. In the TV teaser, when the truck passes, snow drifts off the bank exposing a set of human nostrils poking from the drift . Angry ice scraper: in a moment like the William H Macy scene in the original Fargo movie, Billy Bob Thornton takes to the windscreen in the new Fargo TV series in which he plays Lorne Malvo, a boastful and manipulative crook FBI agents are obsessed with tracking down . Each teaser offers some nod to the film, on which this series is loosely based, reports cinemablend.com. The 'Roadside', in which the pair of human nostrils protrudes from a snowbank, is a reminder of the film's opening scene. The Billy Bob Thornton teaser is like the film scene in which a red-faced William H Macy as an angry Jerry Lundegaard attacks the windscreen with an ice scraper. In the FX spin-off, Freeman as Nygaard plays a henpecked insurance salesman who is based loosely on the Macy role. The series also stars Oliver Platt (The Big C) and Bob Odenkirk (â€˜Better Call Saulâ€™ in Breaking Bad), Kate Walsh (Greys Anatomy), and tom Hank's son Colin Hanks (Mad Men, Orange County and Parkland). The dark humour and Midwest setting remains, but the series has an entirely new plot.

"By . Quentin Letts . PUBLISHED: . 19:40 EST, 17 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:43 EST, 17 March 2014 . According to Who’s Who, Clarissa Dickson Wright’s recreations were ‘hunting, shooting, fishing, food, rugby, men’. This most extravagant of characters was being uncharacteristically economical, for she could easily have added ‘exploding shibboleths’ to that list. Though she will be remembered by millions as a TV chef, Miss Dickson Wright, whose death was announced yesterday, was more influential and complex than that plastic term suggests. She was a former lawyer, an alcoholic and a daughter of wealth who plunged into penury through her own profligate faults. Country character: Clarissa, pictured above in 2004, has died at the age of 66 . Incidentally, she disliked the noun ‘chef’. ‘I am,’ she would say, nostrils flaring, ‘a cook. Chefs are forever stacking and arranging the food. They forget what the food was about in the first place.’ It was a typically no-nonsense, ego-pricking statement. As soon as a dish was out of the oven she slopped it up on a plate and got stuck in. Years of posing by poncy TV chefs went down the drain! Clarissa was, in her eventful life, a pheasant plucker, master butcher, author, restaurateur, businesswoman and Lord Rector of Aberdeen University. She was also a campaigner, particularly for field sports and farmers’ markets. She was the most prominent supporter of the Countryside Alliance, throwing her considerable weight behind rural people’s desire to see off the nanny state and be left to their own devices. Fame: Clarissa, left, alongside Jennifer Patterson, right, in the Two Fat Ladies cookery series . Nation's favourite: Clarissa with Jennifer in a Two Fat Ladies promotional picture from 1997 . Clarissa was one of those countrywomen who, if told not to do something, are more likely to do it. Was this not the essence of the woman? She was disobedient. Magnificently so. In the public’s mind, she will forever be the larger half of the Two Fat Ladies cookery show, the one in the motorbike sidecar with a daft helmet that looked more like a Lancaster bomber pilot’s headgear. She was the one whose accent was as clipped as a stately home’s yew hedge. With it went a politically incorrect approach to hygiene, both in the kitchen and in her language. Boy, she could be withering when she wished. More than any of these, however, Clarissa was a state of mind, an attitude, a two-fingered rebuke to convention. She bridled at officialdom. She saw that the man (or woman) in the ministry was often a fool. And like many people who ride in motorbike sidecars, she had a fatalistic side. She accepted that life had its potholes and sharp corners. The very fact that she had lived so much made her doubly, trebly human. Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmerelda Dickson Wright was born in 1947, the youngest of four children of a celebrated London surgeon and his soft-hearted Australian heiress wife. Clarissa loved her mother Molly. She hated her father Arthur. Bohemian: Clarissa pictured smoking a pipe in her Bohemian youth, in 1968 . Her memoirs Spilling The Beans (2007) accused him of being a violent drunk. ‘The first time I saw my father hit my mother I was six,’ she wrote. Arthur was a surgeon to the Royal Family and his circle included Harry Secombe, Yehudi Menuhin and Alexander Fleming. The family lived in a nine-bedroom house in London’s smart St John’s Wood and the appearance was one of prosperous distinction. Clarissa claimed otherwise. She told of her father beating his wife and using physical violence against his children. These stories have been challenged by her sister and niece. What seems less open to dispute is that Clarissa saw herself as a victim. Perhaps this most melancholy of women was trying to understand why, in her middle years, she fell so dreadfully into the bottle. All those Christian names sound more like roll-call at a convent school. She said that the last one, Esmerelda, was in memory of her father’s favourite pig. Was he signalling a lack of interest in his fourth child? He later said she was an ‘unwanted’ addition to the family. It may explain the sadness in those bloodhound eyes, the slight droopiness of the mouth. She was happier at boarding school (the Sacred Heart, in Hove) than at home. Her headmistress, Mother Joan, asked her why this should be and Clarissa told her about her father’s roughness. Mother Joan told her she was a wicked child to speak so ill of a fine, upstanding man and reported her remarks to Arthur. ‘It took me years to trust anyone again,’ wrote Clarissa. The old man wanted her to go into medicine. She chose the law and became a barrister (the youngest female barrister in England) in 1968. She claimed to have been a contemporary of Tony Blair and said he had the camp nickname ‘Miranda’. In fact, she was called to the Bar eight years before Blair. The law, at least in those days, was a place of Rumpole lunches and Bar dinners. Clarissa, once a slender, slightly bohemian figure, threw herself into the party scene. Fondly remembered: Clarissa riding in a motorcycle sidecar alongside Jennifer . Her diabetic father was also a drinker - his breakfast orange juice was allegedly laced with vodka. Her mother’s death in 1975 distressed her greatly and she started drinking hard. She later wrote that she thought alcohol was ‘the key to the universe, the abatement of pain’. Some said she was a good enough lawyer to have become Lord Chancellor one day. Drink and rebelliousness prevented that. At her local pub in Sussex they would give her four double gins and two small tonics in a pint mug when she arrived for the evening. Her legal career collapsed, but she had enough money (an inheritance of £2.8million) to be able to ignore this. But in 1982 she went off the rails after the death of her boyfriend, an insurance salesman called Clive — ‘the only real love of my life,’ she wrote. They had conducted an affair for 14 years, much of it in restaurants (until they were thrown out for becoming too rowdy). When the drink killed Clive, she started a mad bout of boozing and one-night stands, including an assignation with an unnamed MP in the Commons - she claimed they made love behind the Speaker’s Chair. Later career: Clarissa in a photo opportunity for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner with Clarissa Dickson Wright . During that time, when she was bouncing off walls in Kilburn pubs and bedding Irish republican sympathisers, she sought solace in two pints of gin a day. It was washed down with so much tonic that, she claimed, the quinine finally damaged her adrenal gland. She twice slept on benches at London’s Victoria coach station. She eventually came to her senses and, with her brother’s encouragement, went to Alcoholics Anonymous. She gave up drink and ended up running the Books For Cooks bookshop in Notting Hill, a honeypot for creative types. A TV producer friend suggested she meet Jennifer Paterson, the eccentric office cook at the Spectator magazine. They were teamed in 1996 as the Two Fat Ladies and a TV hit (the Queen Mother’s favourite) was minted. It was, wrote Clarissa, ‘a great achievement for two old bats’. Though they were less close than the cameras suggested, there was a perfect chemistry. Jennifer gurgled with laughter, delighted in practical jokes and slowly roasted herself in the juices of conviviality. She was a good 20 years older than her co-star, yet she radiated an almost childlike delight. Clarissa was more private, bookish and acid. She was prone to bouts of introspection and anger at the modern world. The Left loathed her forthright opinions but she should have been a feminist pin-up: an intelligent woman unfazed that she looked so unpretty. After Jennifer’s death, Clarissa could have disappeared. That she did not was evidence that she had struck a public chord. Lofty: Clarissa at the Althorp House Literary Festival in June 2008 . Fans loved her plain speaking and contempt for health and safety (she thought environmental health officers a particular menace). Despite that la-di-dah accent, she had no time for snobbery. She was uninterested in hierarchy, except the gradations of egg sizes and the relative merits of decent vinegar. Proper country pursuit: Clarissa out hunting . I saw her sail past lots of famous faces at a London party to bury herself in conversation with a junior publishing assistant. She revelled in making modern, urban, moist-palmed Britain re-examine its platitudes and justify its incorrigibly spongy-brained ways. Her long support for hunting probably cost her thousands of book sales. She cared not one jot. To her - and she was a considerable animal lover - the case against hunting was emotive and misguided. She considered hunting to be a perfectly proper country pursuit and could not abide the busy-body animal rights brigade who seemed to know a great deal less about animal welfare than the rural people they criticised. She was a bird-watcher, but also a bird eater. Pink-foot geese? Yes, she said, beautiful creatures - and with a very delicate flavour. Her views often got her in trouble. Two years ago, she suggested that instead of a ministry cull, we should start eating badgers. After all, badger was once a regular dish for working men and in her youth she claimed to have seen badger hams in West Country pubs. ‘Just like a jamon iberico,’ she said. At first, one thought this is outrageous. But then, on further consideration, one realised that she maybe had a point. Clarissa Dickson Wright distrusted modernism and smouldered with disdain for soppy sentimentalism. She was a stonking, snorting original and perhaps the only surprising thing is that, after the lakes of booze she drank earlier in her life, she made it to 66.","Two Fat Ladies star died yesterday aged 66 following a period of illness .

Schoolboy Alex McTeer, 10, was so angry about having to do school work after class, he told his mother he wanted to write to the Prime Minister. But when he received a reply, it seemed David Cameron's staff had not done enough homework themselves, as the date on the correspondence was wrong. Alex, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, explained to his mother he'd 'had enough' of homework and penned a note to the PM in the hope he would take action. The response was signed by Stephanie, a 10 Downing Street Correspondence Officer. It stresses the need to be ‘well organised’ - despite the fact the date was wrong by 12 months - stating it was 2013 rather than 2014. He wrote: 'Dear Mr Cameron, I am writing to ask if you will change the law so children don't have to do  homework, especially on a Friday.

Police are hunting for this man who cycled off the end of Caerphilly railway station and into a tunnel, causing 14 hours of delays . A cyclist who rode into train tunnel was being hunted by police today after causing hours of delays. Transport police released CCTV photos of the 'reckless idiot' cyclist wheeling along the train tracks into the mile-long tunnel at 6.12am on Wednesday. It caused a major safety alert - and more than 14 hours of delays on the main commuter line between Cardiff and Caerphilly in South Wales. The alarm was raised when the cyclist disappeared into the tunnel - and was feared he could be trapped inside. Trains on the busy line were placed on caution at first before the services were suspended while police searched the track. British Transport Police spokesman Morgan Andrews said: 'I am genuinely shocked to see that, despite our constant warnings some people are still willing to risk their lives by trespassing on the tracks. 'This was absolutely senseless behaviour and I cannot overstate just how dangerous it is.' The man was seen to cycle off the end of the platform at Caerphilly railway station before walking along the track and into the tunnel. He could have cycled all the way along the tunnel which cuts through Caerphilly mountain to the Cardiff suburb of Lisvane on the other side. Mr Andrews said: 'Luckily, on this occasion, no one was injured, but the scenario could easily have been different. British Transport Police thought the man could have become stuck inside the tunnel which runs between Caerphilly and the Cardiff suburb of Lisvane . The man cycled off the end of this station platform, causing 14 hours of delays on the main commuter line . 'Train drivers will not be expecting anyone other than railway workers to be on the line, and by the time they see someone trespassing it could be too late.

Channel 5 has been blasted by Ofcom for broadcasting a Big Brother in which a female contestant was grabbed by the throat and threatened by another housemate. In an episode screened last year, Daley Ojuederie grasped Hazel O'Sullivan's neck and pinned her to a bed after a heated argument. Ojuederie was eventually asked to leave the Big Brother house over his behaviour. Blasted: Ofcom condemned Big Brother for not clearly stating that it was unacceptable for Daley Ojuederie to grasp Hazel O'Sullivan's neck and pin her to a bed at the height of a heated argument on air . The programme was ruled by the broadcasting regulator to have breached rules on offensive content, by featuring the threatening behaviour and the late intervention over the incident. Ojuederie's threats to O'Sullivan came after a row over a duvet when they were shut away from the others in a 'luxury house' as part of a task. During his outburst he told her: 'Let me tell you something, little girl, have some respect for your f****** elder, 'cause if you don't... I'll finish you.' He went on to grab O'Sullivan's throat and pinned her arms down as she lay on her bed, miming headbutting her as he threatened: 'Don't f*** with me, do you understand? Before I nut you one.'

Controversy: He insisted he is not a malicious person after viewers reacted to his treatment of Miss O'Sullivan . Ofcom was critical of the decision not to edit the footage to limit the offence to viewers, and the 'lack of clarity' that his conduct was not acceptable. It follows news that the reality shows sparked the most viewer complaints last year - almost 1,500. Ofcom received 166 complaints over the neck-throttling scene within minutes of it being screened. In total, the June series of Big Brother triggered 965 complaints and August's Celebrity Big Brother a further 438. Viewers were outraged by housemate Jemima Slade getting an â€˜unjustified' official warning for saying black men are not her type. Last year, Big Brother received the most viewer complaints of any show, with almost 1,500 submitted to Ofcom . Ofcom received 305 complaints in June that Slade, 41, had been 'unfairly accused of racism'. Slade had said: 'I do go for younger guys, generally. I go for darker looking, not black, but darker features, more like Mediterranean.' Big Brother said her language was 'unacceptable and potentially offensive'. A further 244 viewers complained that Gina Rio had bullied fellow housemate Hazel O'Sullivan.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:51 EST, 17 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:10 EST, 17 March 2014 . David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s rose garden love-in has been branded ‘sick-inducing’ by a former Lib Dem adviser. Julia Goldsworthy, who has now quit the Treasury to try to win back a seat in Parliament, said activists would have been appalled at the sight of the Tory and Lib Dem leaders ‘hamming it up’ in the sunshine after the coalition was formed in 2010. She also revealed Chancellor George Osborne warned Treasury insiders that if they did anything to undermine the Government ‘you will be out of here faster than your legs can carry you’. Unity: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Tory David Cameron used the press conference in the Number 10 garden to present the first coalition in Britain since the war . Laughs: At one point Mr Cameron was reminded that when once asked what his favourite political joke was, he replied: 'Nick Clegg' The bonhomie was supposed to show that two parties can work well together, but it was stomach-churning for party activists . After . months of internal battling over policy priorities, the Tories and Lib . Dems want to use the Budget this week to present a united front. Mr . Cameron and Mr Clegg are expected to appear together in public again . before Mr Osborne sets out his economic plans in the Commons on . Wednesday. But the public . displays of unity have left Lib Dem activists in particularly anxious . that they risk being seen as an annex of the Tory party. Miss Goldsworthy lost her Camborne and Redruth in 2010 to Tory George Eustice by just 66 votes. Like . many Lib Dems she was uncomfortable watching the infamous joint press . conference between Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg in the garden of Downing . Street. Happier times: In the May sunshine of 2010, both party leaders were keen to show how well they got on . Threshold: Four years after the bonhomie, both parties are now battling to take credit for key policies, including cutting income tax for low earners . Sharing jokes, . exchanging meaningful glances and referring to each other chummily as . Nick and David, they couldn't have looked happier. At one point Mr Cameron was reminded by a journalist that he had once described his Mr Clegg as 'my favourite political joke'. But such was the mood of the moment that Mr Clegg, after a theatrical show of mock offence, readily agreed to forgive and forget. Former Lib Dem MP Julia Golsdworthy said both parties had to show that the coalition could work . Miss Goldsworthy said: ‘I sat at home watching Nick and David in their first press conference in the Rose Garden. ‘I think probably for a lot of political activists it was quite sick-inducing, but it was absolutely necessary because of the economy and national interest,’ she told the Independent on Sunday. ‘Coalition was a fairly new thing to get our heads around. It was fairly important to demonstrate that this was a relationship that could work. It was fairly important to ham it up at the start, to show that this was something that was going to last.’ Miss Goldsworthy first became an MP in 2005, and quickly joined the Lib Dem frontbench under Charles Kennedy, and later Sir Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg. Once tipped as a future leader, she took party in Channel 4 reality TV show The Games but was caught up in the expenses scandal after claiming £1,200 for a pink rocking chair for upmarket store Heal's. Within weeks of losing her seat in May 2010 she . landed a job as a spin doctor for Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny . Alexander – a job she had shadowed in opposition. She added: ‘Danny and the Chancellor have . said… because economic stability so crucial, the Treasury is the . department where the Coalition more than anywhere else has to work. ‘George . has always been very, very clear to anyone coming in to the Treasury, . he told any ministers and advisers, this is the department where the . coalition has to work: ‘If I catch you doing anything to undermine the . Government you will be out of here faster than your legs can carry . you”.’ However, the two parties are locked in a very public battle over taking credit for income tax cuts. The Lib Dems promised at the 2010 election to increase the amount workers can earn before paying tax to £10,000. After losing her seat at the 2010 election, Julia Goldsworthy became an adviser for Lib Dem Danny Alexander (right) but was warned by Chancellor George Osborne against undermining the coalition . Before the election the Tories said it was unaffordable but it became the flagship personal tax cut of the coalition. Since then Mr Osborne has sought to gain the advantage by claiming the cut – worth £700 to basic rate taxpayers – as a Conservative policy. However, an opinion poll last week showed 45 per cent of voters think the Lib Dems deserve most credit for this policy, well ahead of the Tories on 33 per cent. In Wednesday’s Budget Mr Osborne is expected to increase the threshold to £10,500, which Mr Clegg has dubbed a ‘workers’ bonus’ worth £100 a year.","Tory and Lib Dem leader held first press conference in the sunshine in 2010 .

Karen Johnson had an allergic reaction from paint sold by B&Q that contains the chemical Methylisothiazolinone . A mother-of-two has claimed she is allergic to her living room after she painted it seven months ago. Karen Johnson says she breaks out in a rash every time she goes into the room to watch television after using white emulsion paint from B & Q. on the walls. Ms Johnson, 52, from Deptford, South East London, said she cannot sit in her front room for more than a couple of hours, and once had such a severe reaction that she had to be rushed to hospital. It is believed she is suffering a reaction to a chemical preservative called Methylisothiazolinone (MI or . MIT), which is routinely added to household products such as paint - as well as moisturisers, sun creams, shampoos and wet . wipes. The receptionist told the Sun: 'It is a nightmare now as I have really bad reactions whenever I come into contact with MI and it is in everything - hand wash, shampoo, washing up liquid. 'I still cannot sit in my front room for more than a few hours without getting a rash.' Skin . experts in the UK and around the world have picked up a large number of . allergic reactions they believe are caused by the chemical. In . December, Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics trade association, . told its members to remove MI from products that are left on the skin - . but at the moment there are no laws stating that it has to be displayed . on the labels of paints. In . a statement, the body said: ‘This action is recommended in the . interests of consumer safety in relation to adverse skin reactions. ‘It . is recommended that companies do not wait for regulatory intervention . under the Cosmetics Regulation but implement this recommendation as soon . as feasible.’ Symptoms . ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the . skin, blisters, itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face. Johnson says she breaks out in a rash every time she goes into the room to watch television after using white emulsion paint from B & Q on the walls . British skin experts say the scale of . the allergic reactions to the chemical, which has been used increasingly . since 2005,  has been alarming. Dermatologists . expect an allergic reaction to a cosmetic product of no more than . 1-2per cent, however British clinics report that the rate has been more . than 10per cent for MI. It . is claimed that scale of harm is more than twice the level of another . ingredient called MDBGN (methydibromo glutaronitrile), which was banned . by the European Commission in 2008.

Rioters passed a police helmet around ‘like a trophy’ after PC Keith Blakelock was killed in the Broadwater Farm disturbances in North London, a jury heard yesterday. A key witness, known as Rhodes Levin to protect his identity, told the Old Bailey he saw Nicky Jacobs, 45, attacking the officer on the estate in Tottenham on October 6, 1985. Levin, who himself admits kicking the police officer a few times, said he saw Jacobs kicking and punching Mr Blakelock during the onslaught. He also claimed he saw the defendant, who denies murder, carrying a lock knife at the scene with a brown handle and blade of around six inches. And he said that immediately afterwards Jacobs had told him that he had ‘got a couple of dukes in’ on the policeman. Levin told the court at that point he saw a police helmet but could not remember who was holding it. ‘They were passing it around, showing it,’ he said. ‘It was like a trophy.’ The witness said that days after the attack he had met Jacobs, who again boasted of getting ‘a couple of stabs’ in on the officer. Levin, who has convictions relating to Class A drugs, was sentenced for affray and handling stolen goods in relation to the riots, the court heard. He was paid around £5,000 and given immunity from prosecution after providing information to a renewed investigation into PC Blakelock's killing in the 1990s. Flashback: The riots occurred around the Broadwater Farm area of Tottenham, on October 6, 1985 . Police approached him again in January 2008 and since then he has received money for a deposit on accommodation and expenses, the court heard. The witness said that two or three months after he was interviewed by police in 1985 he had been assaulted at a party in Tottenham and warned not to get involved. ‘Somebody called me into the toilets and when I went into the toilets a couple of people blocked off the toilet door,’ he said. ‘One of the guys smashed a bottle over my head and I managed to struggle my way out of the door.’ Under cross-examination by Courtenay Griffiths QC, for the defence, Levin admitted that he and the prosecution's two other key witnesses had grown up together. Aftermath: Police look at the devastation following the 1985 riots in the Broadwater Farm area of Tottenham . After being arrested in November 1985 he was kept in custody for five days without the assistance of a lawyer, the court heard. 'They were passing it around, showing it. It was like a trophy' Rhodes Levin . During interviews with police he was assaulted and his testicles were squeezed on more than one occasion, he said. But Levin denied that officers had suggested names that they wanted him to ‘put in the frame’. During the interviews he told police that Winston Silcott had been orchestrating the attack on PC Blakelock and was the only one he saw with a ‘large machete’ - a claim he now admits was a lie. Mr Silcott went on to become one of three men who had their 1987 convictions for allegedly murdering the officer quashed in 1991. Tributes: Flowers left at the scene where PC Blakelock was killed during riots at the Broadwater Farm estate . Asked why he had accused Mr Silcott, Levin told the court: ‘Because it seemed like him. It looked like him.’ Mr Griffiths said: ‘So on a belief you were willing to put someone's name forward for the murder of a police officer - that is something you are capable of doing?’ Levin answered: ‘I believed it was him at the time.’ The court heard that Levin had also placed Jacobs' cousin - who was remanded in custody for robbery at the time of the riots - at the murder scene. After the disturbances the witness started using cocaine powder, then crack cocaine and eventually heroin, the court heard. The trial continues.

A clocktower which has chimed every 15 minutes since 1872 could be silenced after a single noise complaint from a woman who has recently moved to the town. The historic market town of Knighton in central Wales has heard every quarter of an hour rung out day and night since the clocktower was built 142 years ago. But it may now be silenced after . Irish author Lane Ashfeldt lodged a formal 'noise nuisance' complaint saying the sound was disturbing guests at the bed and breakfast she has . just taken over. Local mood: Knighton's mayor Roger Bright (left) wants to keep the clocktower (right) tolling. The noise complaint was made by Lane Ashfeldt - who runs a B&B from the building with the gold window frames (far left) Dublin-born Miss Ashfeldt runs a 'writer's retreat' at the three-bedroom Offa Dyke House guest house, which overlooks he clocktower in a small square in the centre of the Welsh town. The . five-night, £235 retreats do not follow a strict itinerary, but are advertised . as a chance for authors to find 'quiet time' in which they can write. Knighton's . mayor Roger Bright is leading a campaign to keep the bells tolling, . saying: 'The whole town is up in arms about this.' 'If a person lived near Big Ben in . London and complained about it chiming would the authorities stop it . overnight? No, they wouldn’t,' he added. 'This clock has been there for over 140 . years and it’s been striking every 15 minutes for all that time - it’s . part of our heritage. I once lived near the clock for 10 years and it . never bothered me,' Mr Bright added. Unhappy: Irish author Lane Ashfeldt (right) has lodged a formal 'noise nuisance' complaint - saying the sound of the clocktower (left) was disturbing guests at the bed and breakfast she has just taken over . The clock chimes one bell at 15 minutes past the hour, twice at half-past, three times at quarter to the hour and four times on the hour, while second bell also marks each hour that passes. Since 1873 the tower bell has clocked . up more than 13,586,760 chimes - but there are fears the chime may soon . be silenced at night following Miss Ashfeldt's complaint. Mr Bright said Knighton's town council is 'very strongly opposed' to the chime being silenced at night. However, council officials say they have a duty to properly investigate any complaint - even if it has only been made by one person. Mr . Bright said: 'The complaint has come from someone who has bought a . B&B close to the clock tower and she is complaining about the noise . for the guests as much as anything.' Historic: Knighton's clocktower as it looked shortly after being built in the late 19th Century . 'But there was a hotel for many years even closer to the clock tower and no one complained about it then,' he added. 'It’s a normal chime of a clock which people get used to and we would miss it terribly at night if it was silenced,' he went on. 'The woman doesn’t realise the feeling of the town I don’t think. The genuine opinion of the town is if they don’t like it they shouldn’t be there,' Mr Bright said. One local resident who did not want to be named said Miss Ashfeldt should have realised when viewing . the house that the clock would chime. He said: 'The whole town is up in arms - she is a newcomer and has only been her for a year. 'When . you come and look at a property you must hear the clock striking . because it happens every 15 minutes... If you don’t like it then you . don’t move into the house,' the resident added.

'This . has upset a great many people in the town and I hope she now realises . it is part of the history and fabric of the community,' he went on. Powys Council confirmed it was investigating the issue and was also in contact with the Welsh government’s heritage body Cadw - the equivalent of English Heritage. A Powys council spokesperson said: 'Our environmental health team received a noise nuisance complaint regarding Knighton’s town clock.' 'Environmental health officers begun an investigation and found that the council was responsible for the town clock.' 'The environmental health team has referred the matter to the department responsible for the town clock and have suggested possible solutions to minimise the noise.

The father of Chelsea captain John Terry threatened a train station cleaner with a bottle and told him 'I will smash it over your head you black c***', a court heard today. Ted Terry, 59, is accused of headbutting and racially abusing an Asian man in a drunken row over a cigarette, allegedly calling Amarjit Talafair a 'f****** Paki' outside a pub. Terry, who was wearing a West Ham top at the time, then went on to Fenchurch Street Station and allegedly threatened cleaner Bakela Masuila with a bottle, while hurling racist abuse at him. The Old Bailey heard that Terry and his friends Tudor Musteata, a . 47-year-old Russian, and, 36, had been drinking for . several hours before the confrontation. At . around 8pm on March 22, last year they approached Mr Talafair as he smoked a . cigarette outside the Windsor Pub near the station in central . London. Alexander Chalk, prosecuting, said: 'Edward Terry was wearing a dark blue jacket with the insignia of West Ham Football Club. One of them approached and asked for a cigarette.

Terry then approached Mr Talafair and said: 'You f****** Paki, let's have it right here and now.' 'The confrontation culminated in Edward Terry approaching Mr Talafair and headbutting him, striking him above the nose,' said Mr Chalk. 'It is alleged the group were hostile, aggressive and abusive.' The court was told that Mr Talafair then went back to his friends in the pub and Terry's group walked off towards Fenchurch Street Station. Group: Terry, and co-defendant Stephen Niland (right), 36, had been drinking for several hours before the confrontation with Amarjit Talafair, the court heard . Accused: The Old Bailey was told that when Mr Talafair walked away Terry's group started shouting: 'F****** Paki, f****** Paki, come here' At the station the group threatened a black cleaner, a train dispatcher and several other witnesses, it is claimed.

The court heard that no charges had been brought in relation to the incident involving Mr Mansuila, who is known as 'Bax'. When interviewed by police on March 28, Terry admitted that he started a confrontation and had been 'acting the goat'. At one point during the confrontation, he claimed, he was approached by a man carrying a bottle. Believing himself to be in danger, he disarmed the male and then pressed his head against the man's forehead before leaving with Niland. Following his arrest Terry admitted having a confrontation with someone he referred to as 'half caste', the court heard.

Accused: Sharon Talbot denies taking a sex toy to the Asheborough House Care Centre in Saltash, Cornwall and declaring she had decided to 'go fishing' instead of attending an end-of-life meeting . A care home matron took a sex toy to work, showed her underwear to staff, and declared she had decided to 'go fishing' instead of attending an end-of-life meeting, a tribunal has heard. Sharon Talbot allegedly revealed her underwear and spoke about her sex life on 'numerous occasions' in the presence of staff at the Asheborough House Care Centre in Saltash, Cornwall. The senior nurse also took a sex toy into the centre which she showed to the deputy matron, Helen Tolcher, a hearing of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in central London was told. In another alleged incident, Ms Talbot played the Kings Of Leon song Sex On Fire within earshot of another staff member and shouted out of her office window afterwards 'Come on vicar, complain about this', the NMC heard. Ms Talbot failed to attend an end-of-life meeting with a dementia specialist at the home as she had decided to 'go fishing instead', it was also alleged. She also 'raised her voice' at the partner of a resident while accusing her of stealing chocolates which had been sent to the resident for his birthday, the NMC was told. Ms Talbot is also accused of shouting at Ms Tolcher 'carry on nursing' in another incident. Neil Jeffs, for the NMC, said Ms Tolcher had resigned as a result of Ms Talbot’s 'unprofessional behaviour' and had subsequently written a letter to Caroline Murphy, the 'responsible individual at the centre' outlining her concerns about Ms Talbot’s behaviour. A further letter, he said, from Ms Tolcher to Ms Murphy in December 2011, signed by 22 members of staff at the home, had outlined allegations against Ms Talbot. 'The letter... includes allegations of constant belittling of staff, staff feeling intimidated and undermined, professional opinions of staff being disregarded to suit the needs of the registrant, staff working under a threat of fear and reprisals, a fear of approaching the registrant for advice and support and the feeling that any grievances raised were perceived as a personal attack by the registrant,' he said. He added that directors of the care home’s parent company met to discuss the allegations and Ms Talbot was suspended pending a disciplinary investigation which was to be conducted by Ms Murphy. Ms Talbot tendered her resignation on December 28 2011, he said, but this was not accepted immediately and she was offered a 'cooling off' period which was due to expire on January 10 2012, he told the NMC. Complaint: The Nursing and Midwifery Council was told that 22 staff at Asheborough House Care Centre in Saltash, Cornwall (pictured) signed a letter outlining allegations against Ms Talbot . As Ms Talbot did not contact the home’s operators - Sheval Ltd - by that time, her resignation was accepted with effect from January 11 2012, he told the hearing. Ms Murphy interviewed 28 members of staff 'all of which spoke about the registrant’s unprofessional behaviour', he said. 'The matter did not proceed to a disciplinary hearing locally because the registrant tendered her resignation but was consequently referred to the NMC,' Mr Jeffs said. The allegations against Ms Talbot, who worked at the home between May 2010 and December 2011 - all denied by her - include that she said 'Polish b****' and 'black cow' in reference to untrained members of staff while talking to Ms Tolcher. She is also alleged to have screamed at another staff member, instructing that she should ask representatives from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to leave the centre, saying 'Get them out of the f****** building'. Ms Talbot is also alleged to have been lying on the floor in her office when she shouted at another pregnant member of staff while refusing to approve her maternity leave. Ms Talbot has denied all the accusations against her including allegations of acting in an unprofessional manner towards staff, behaving abusively, intimidating and undermining staff members.

"By . Wills Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 09:49 EST, 17 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:46 EST, 17 March 2014 . A controversial BBC Panorama programme which sent an undercover team into North Korea, pretending to be a group of LSE students, has breached a number of editorial guidelines. A report by the corporation's Trust said the BBC failed to ensure the students were aware of the risks involved in the trip. The BBC has subsequently apologised to the university after the publication concluded LSE experienced 'unfair treatment' because it ended up being linked to the controversial investigation. Dangerous investigation: BBC Panorama reporter John Sweeney pretended to be a student when he went on a trip to North Korea to film a special programme . For the programme, North Korea Undercover, reporter John Sweeney spent eight days in the pariah state, joining an organised tour which had been planned by his wife, Tomiko Newson. When the film came to light, it was condemned by senior officials from the university who asked for the programme not to be shown. But it was screened as planned in April 2013, leading to a complaint from the father of one of the students involved. Although the Trust believed there was a 'strong public interest' in the broadcast, it said the BBC 'failed to consider a number of important issues and risks, and failed to deal with them appropriately'. In its report published today, the Trust’s editorial standards committee said: 'The provision of information to the students who took part in the trip was insufficient and inadequate, and meant the daughter of the complainant did not possess the knowledge necessary to give informed consent.' Danger: Members of the group from the London School of Economics were put at risk, the Trust concluded . In order to gain the appropriate paperwork, the team had used LSE address details for their visa applications. Today’s report said doing so was 'inappropriate and this, combined with other factors, risked linking the LSE with the trip and resulted in unfair treatment to the LSE'. It went on: 'From the moment the BBC became involved in the trip to North Korea, Tomiko Newson (who was the trip organiser and tour leader) had a conflict of interest which was further compounded when she became employed by the BBC. 'The BBC should have ensured there was someone independent of the programme team present to lead the trip. Alison Hastings, who chairs the Trust’s editorial standards committee, said: 'Discovering stories in difficult or dangerous places is one of the BBC’s greatest strengths. 'There was a real public interest in making this programme in North Korea but, in the Trust’s view, the BBC failed to ensure that all the young adults Panorama travelled with were sufficiently aware of any potential risks to enable them to give informed consent. Condemnation: A report published by the BBC Trust said there were 'serious failings' in the organisation of the investigative programme which was broadcast last year . 'This was a serious failing, and the BBC is right to apologise to the complainants.' Sweeney was also accompanied by a cameraman/producer from Panorama in order to make their film and they travelled around the country on a tour given by North Korean guides, and they recorded their visit on the sort of cameras tourists would use, rather than taking specialist equipment. The Trust found that the problems lay with the gathering rather than the broadcast of the material. At the time of the broadcast concerns were raised about the impact the programme could have on academics working in sensitive areas around the world. Following their return from the £2,000-a-head trip, the students were said to have received an email from a North Korean tourism official which said: 'I reserve the right to make public and publish all personal data, including all your passports, to demonstrate that while we have been direct and honest with you, you have broken the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) law.' Tensions: Tourists have begun to visit the rogue state more frequently, but the group of students allegedly received threats from Pyongyang after the programme was aired . BBC News said it accepted the Trust's decision and said it had apologised to the LSE and the student - referred to as Student X - whose father had complained. But it said that at the time the programme was being made, it believed they were being treated 'fairly'. In a statement, BBC News said: 'We are pleased that the Trust found that there was a clear and strong public interest in commissioning and broadcasting the programme and that the correct referral procedures and processes were followed by the programme team and senior management. 'We also accept, however, that aspects of the BBC's handling of the project fell short in a number of areas, with the Trust finding against the BBC on four of its 21 rulings. 'In particular we have apologised to Student X for the finding by the Trust that insufficient information was given to her ahead of the trip about the involvement of the BBC journalists and the potential risks, which meant that Student X did not have sufficient knowledge on which to give informed consent. We have also apologised to the LSE for the Trust's finding that the programme created the risk of harm to the LSE's reputation. Contact: On their return, the students, who visited a number of attractions in the pariah state during their time received an email saying they had 'broken the law' 'The Trust recognised that this programme involved a number of finely-balanced editorial judgments and that the BBC spent considerable time evaluating the risks in circumstances which were highly unusual. In the planning for and making of the programme, BBC News believed that it was treating all the students and the LSE fairly.' During its investigation, the committee was told that the BBC's risk assessment had determined that if the team was discovered, they would try to 'separate' themselves from the students but this could have led to them being more vulnerable. 'The committee considered that, while this might well have been a tactic aimed at isolating the students from further risk, it would inevitably have had the effect of preventing Tomiko Newson acting primarily as group leader, and that the students would have been left, in effect, as a group of young adults from a variety of different countries, all personally responsible for trying to extricate themselves from possible detention,' the report said. The BBC says it has apologised to the university, but suggested there was a 'public interest' in airing the investigation . It concluded that it was not viable for her to lead the trip and be certain of being able to act in the best interests of the students in North Korea from the moment the BBC became involved. But her relationship with Sweeney was not itself a conflict of interest. Director of the LSE, Professor Craig Calhoun, said: 'LSE welcomes the finding of the Editorial Standards Committee and the letter of apology issued to the school by the BBC Executive. 'LSE would like to confirm its strong support for the production of programmes in the public interest and for journalists working to highlight important issues in dangerous parts of the world.'","Trust said corporation failed to warn students of risk of trip .

Exposed: Motorbike officer David Salsbury, 39, admitted exposing himself inside a supermarket, a corner shop and even his own police station . A former police officer has today admitted exposing himself inside a supermarket, a corner shop and even his own police station. Motorbike officer David Salsbury, 39, deliberately exposed his genitals in a way likely to cause 'distress and alarm' to the public, a court heard. Salsbury committed his first offence inside the police station in Brixham, Devon, on June 16, 2012 when he unzipped his police-issue leathers and exposed himself in the building’s lobby. He then exposed himself again four months later on October 14, 2012 at a Co-op supermarket and on the same day at a convenience store while he was off-duty. The court heard Salsbury was a serving officer in Devon and Cornwall Police when he carried out the three offences. However, after his arrest in March last year he resigned from his job and his wife divorced him in September. He initially claimed the exposures happened accidentally as he was adjusting his clothing and was due to stand trial at Exeter Crown Court today. Instead he pleaded guilty to three charges of exposing himself in a way which was likely to cause alarm and distress, under section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. He denied a further allegation that he exposed himself at the Pets at Home shop at Newton Abbot on October 26, which is not being pursued by the prosecution and will lie on file. At a previous hearing prosecutor Sonia Croft said: 'When he unzipped his motorbike leathers he did them all the way down.' David Sapiecha, defending, today said . that Salsbury may have committed the offences because of post traumatic . stress disorder suffered as a result of his policing career. He said admitting the offences had been 'the most difficult decision in his life'. Mr Sapiecha: This was not a cynical attempt by him to . avoid justice; it has been probably the most difficult decision of his . life and one which he has had tremendous problems over. 'He has resigned from his position and is now divorced and is concerned with regard to contact with his children.

Leading world press freedom organisations condemned the Government’s Royal Charter on press regulation yesterday as ‘no form of solution at all’. The charter was drawn up by politicians and approved by the Queen in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists. But in a highly critical report, the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) said excluding the newspaper industry from the final drafting process was ‘a major error’. It said any regulatory system must have the support of the industry and warned there was growing evidence that moves to heavily regulate Britain’s newspapers are being used by repressive regimes to excuse their own press curbs. The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) said excluding the newspaper industry from the final drafting process of the Royal Charter was 'a major error'. File picture . The Royal Charter underpins with statute a new body to oversee the regulation of the Press, with publications that refuse to comply facing exemplary damages in libel cases. Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up, fearing it would bring an end to 300 years of press freedom. Instead, the Press is establishing a fully independent body to police its activities, the Independent Press Standards Organisation. It will be able to impose fines of up to £1million for serious and systemic wrongdoing. The WAN-IFRA report, Press Freedom In The UK, follows a two-day fact-finding mission by international editors to the UK in January. The 42-page document said: ‘The exclusion of the industry in the final drafting process of the Royal Charter was a major error, if the intention was for a genuine improvement in the culture, ethics and professionalism of the Press. ‘A solution that did not include any of the media industry is entirely counterproductive, and can be described as no form of solution at all. There has been a real lack of public discussion about the implications of the issues raised by the Leveson Inquiry and their effects – positively or negatively – for freedom of expression in the UK. ‘The speed of implementation of the Royal Charter proposal, coupled with the lack of legislative scrutiny, parliamentary vote or public consultation, has undoubtedly contributed to a general lack of understanding around the issues. The entire negotiation process in the build-up to a deal on a new system for regulation should have been more transparent.’ Referring to ‘UK government interference’ towards the Guardian following its publication of US surveillance stories based on information from whistleblower Edward Snowden, it adds: ‘Political assurances that the Royal Charter scheme provides a hands-off solution for press regulation and can guarantee press freedom are somewhat undermined by the readiness of the UK government to intervene against the Guardian.’ WAN-IFRA said: 'The royal charter system - used as an example or transposed elsewhere to countries lacking the United Kingdom's historic commitment to human rights - risks an open invitation for abuse in other parts of the world' WAN-IFRA, which represents more than 18,000 publications, 15,000 online sites and 3,000 companies in more than 120 countries, warns that ‘even the suggestion of a decline in Britain’s regard for press freedom risks serious repercussions in other parts of the world’. It said: ‘The royal charter system – used as an example or transposed elsewhere to countries lacking the United Kingdom’s historic commitment to human rights – risks an open invitation for abuse in other parts of the world. ‘There is growing evidence, reported by the WAN-IFRA membership, that the British approach – either in terms of regulation, or in the misuse of terrorism and national security legislation – is being used by repressive regimes to excuse their own practices towards the Press. The British Government... should reiterate clearly to the international community that it continues to support a free and independent press, and back these statements with discernible action at home to support rather than punish journalism.’ Its chief executive Vincent Peyregne said: ‘Given the UK’s continued influence over developing nations where media are essential for the spread of democratic values, the future of a free, independent press... is under threat worldwide.’ Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said the report was a ‘sad and damning indictment of the political classes in a country that prides itself on being the mother of modern democracies’. He added: ‘No wonder journalists across the world are concerned that Britain, which lectures other countries about press freedom, has after 300 years taken a retrograde step in its own backyard. ‘We hope ministers will take note of the call to support a free and independent press internationally and back these statements with discernible action at home to support rather than punish journalism.’","Press freedom organisation has called Charter 'no form of solution at all'

North Korea has been told today to stop 'provocative activities' after it test-fired 25 rockets into the sea. The rockets were fired from an area located on the east coast and flew about 42 miles over the Sea of Japan, a defence ministry spokesman from South Korea said. The ministry said 10 rockets were fired at around 9am GMT or 6.30pm local time - with eight more launched two hours later. Another seven followed, the last at 9:30pm. North Korea fired 25 missiles off the east coast and in to the sea today. Pictured is one of North Korea's artillery sub-units thought to be launched in a drill in March last year . Yonhap news agency also reported 25 short-range missiles were fired. Seoul's military 'has maintained a close watch for possible North Korean provocations', the spokesman said. . 'We urge North Korea to stop provocative activities that will heighten military tension across the border,' the spokesman added. South Korean troops have increased vigilance following a series of rocket or missile launches since late February. North Korean air missiles displayed during a parade. South Korean troops have increased vigilance towards activity following a series of missile launches since late February . The activity coincides with annual South Korea-US military exercises that started in February and will run until mid-April. Pyongyang, capital of North Korea, routinely says such war games are rehearsals for an invasion, while Seoul and Washington say they are purely defensive. North Korea has defended its missile and rocket tests as justifiable self-defence drills. South Korea has called the launches a 'reckless provocation' - while Washington urged Pyongyang to halt the tests immediately, saying they risked inflaming regional tensions. The launch came two days after the North's National Defence Commission threatened to demonstrate its nuclear deterrence. North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un pictured, defended the action today - and said it was for a self defence drill. However, a Seoul defence spokesman said it was a provocative action . Analysts said the comments could indicate the regime is preparing to carry out a fourth atomic test. 'Additional measures will be taken to demonstrate its might one after another as long as the US nuclear threat and blackmail persist as now', the commission said in a statement. 'The US had better roll back its worn-out hostile policy towards (North Korea) as soon as possible and shape a new realistic policy before it is too late.' North Korea and its main ally China want a resumption of six-party talks on the North's nuclear weapons programme. But the United States and South Korea both insist that Pyongyang first demonstrates some tangible commitment to abandoning nuclear weapons. The North carried out nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and in February last year. Analysts in Seoul said the North is now mulling three options - a fourth nuclear test, the firing of a long-range rocket or the disclosure of progress in its programme to enrich uranium. Despite tensions over the drills and the North's missile tests, cross-border ties are currently enjoying an upswing. The two Koreas recently held the first reunion for more than three years of families divided by the Korean War - an event that raised hopes of greater cooperation.","25 rockets fired off North Korean east coast, flying 42 miles over sea .

Drunk driver: Darren Byng, 45, has left a couple with a £50,000 repair bill after he ploughed a stolen Jaguar car into a couple's £175,000, four-bedroom home in Thornton-Cleveleys, Manchester . A drunk driver has left a couple with a £50,000 repair bill after he ploughed a stolen Jaguar into the side of their home. Darren Byng, 45, took the luxury X-Type vehicle  after an afternoon of drinking at his home in Fleetwood, Lancashire. He drove for a few miles before he lost control of the car and crashed into the four-bedroom home of Brian and Susan Nuttall. The couple, who were looking after two grandchildren at the time, said the car's impact was so big 'it felt like the house was going to down'. Three palm trees, worth £2,000 each, were also uprooted when the vehicle veered onto the grass. The pair believe it was only through sheer luck that nobody was injured, as their two-year-old grandson Charlie was sleeping upstairs. Mr Nuttall, 66, was sat in the living room when the car careered into the side of the house. They had to be evacuated from their £175,000 property in Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire, while Byng, who initially tried to walk off, told police he was sorry for crashing his 'mate's car'. He added: 'I shouldn’t have been driving. I don’t have a licence. I’m not a nasty person.' It emerged Byng was banned from the roads at the time and was three times the drink drive limit, later claiming he drank 50 pints of beer every week. Mr and Mrs Nuttall, who have four children and six grandchildren, have been forced to start major repair work on their home, which they have lived in for 23 years. The extensive restoration will involve the rebuilding of a gable wall and a chimney stack, and repairs to the living room. They were forced to live with their son for two weeks as firemen cut off the gas supply because of fears it could cause an explosion. Byng was jailed for 12 months at Preston Crown Court after admitting aggravated vehicle taking, drink driving and driving whilst banned and without insurance. He was banned from driving for a further five years and was only ordered to pay £100 victim surcharge, despite causing thousands of pounds worth of damage. Devastated: Brian and Susan Nuttall with grandson Charlie and grand daughter Ruby outside their damaged home where they have begun extensive restoration work . But Mrs Nuttall, 62, a retired supermarket supervisor said: 'He should have got longer in jail. I couldn’t believe it when I saw the damage. 'On the night it happened there was the shock of the house being shunted then the horrific noise the house made. It sounded like it was falling down. We looked out of the window and we saw this great big car sat on our garden. 'Considering the state of him already being disqualified from driving I think it is disgusting he was on the road in the first place. 'He could have killed anyone walking around the corner. There are little kids playing in the street all the time, he could have easily mowed a little girl down.' 'The firemen explained he hit the concrete post on the fence before the chimney and if he hadn’t hit that the car would have been sat in the lounge. 'Somebody was smiling down on us because normally Charlie is playing in the living room but he had been to nursery and was tired so luckily he was upstairs. Damage: The pair will also have to pay to replace their prized palm trees, which were knocked over . Distraught: They lost three palm trees, worth £2,000 each . 'Otherwise he would have been right by the fire when the house shook. It was so powerful our next-door neighbours felt their house shake and came out to see what was going on. Now if you are upstairs and hear a loud engine it does make you sit up whereas before I didn’t take any notice. As well as the damage to the house, part-time energy consultant Mr Nuttall, 66, lost three palm trees worth £2,000 each. He said: 'When the surveyors come to check on the house they will have to take down the chimney breast to see if there is more damage so we will have to move somewhere else while they do that for however long. It’s caused a big upheaval. 'The insurance have been and will put it right. The cost will be £50,000 plus some of the things like the palm trees we aren’t insured for. No doubt our premiums will be sky high next time.' Byng, of Fleetwood, had previously been banned from driving for five years and should have taken a retest before going back on the road. But on February 6 he went to the pub before walking to his friend’s address where they began drinking wine and shots. Bill: The couple have said an insurance company will cover some of the costs but there premiums will be 'sky high' next time . Construction: They have been forced to put up scaffolding outside their home as they begin repair work . The friend later noticed that his car had gone, as well as the keys. The court heard Mrs Nuttall was in her front bedroom when she heard 'an almighty bang and felt the whole bedroom shake.' 'She thought the house was going to fall down,' said Jeremy Grout Smith, prosecuting. They went out and Byng was sat in the driver’s seat of the car, trying to start it up. Mrs Nuttall ordered him to remain at the scene - but simply walked off down the street, despite her efforts to get him to go into the house until the police arrived. Two officers later found Byng, who held his arms out in front and was immediately handcuffed.The Jaguar was written off. Interior: The impact also caused parts of the fireplace to break and fall onto the living room floor . In mitigation, Byng’s lawyer Paul Robinson said: 'A number of factors conspired together to cause him to behave in this fashion that night. 'Since these offences he has not consumed anything stronger than lager and shandy. He has shown remorse.' But Judge Jacqueline Beech told Byng: 'You pose a high risk of reoffending. This offence is too serious for anything other than an immediate sentence of imprisonment.'

After hours of searching, officers found the pair at a nearby house, and arrested Adams - who tried to run. Lana-Mai has been taken to hospital to be checked over. Chief Supt Dave Sturman, Commander of Walsall, said: 'We would like to thank the people of Walsall and beyond for their help in this fast moving enquiry. 'I am relieved and pleased to be able to say that Lana-Mai is safe and well. 'Thank you to everyone who helped share our appeal.' Lana-Mai's mother called police in a state of concern shortly after 2am. She said Adams took some formula and bottles but few other essential items, police said in an appeal for information.

Stuart Adams, who has been arrested on suspicion of assault, is 5ft 7in tall with dark hair and last seen wearing blue jeans, blue jacket, white t-shirt and white trainers. Police launched an appeal urging people to come forward with any information or may have seen anything this morning near the house in Pleck in Walsall. A West Midlands police spokesman said: . 'Officers searching for a father and his nine-week-old have this . afternoon found a baby safe and well. 'The child has been taken to hospital as a precaution to be checked over. 'Moments ago, a man in Walsall was arrested.' Lana-Mai turned nine weeks old yesterday and was wearing a pink babygrow with press-studs down the front with a ballerina design . The pair were found nearby in Walsall 'safe and well'. Police said a man was arrested and baby taken to hospital . Earlier, Walsall Police chief inspector . Sue Parker said: 'We are incredibly concerned for Lana-Mai's welfare as . she is so young and we understand her departure from the family home was . not planned. 'We know that Stuart had been drinking earlier in the night and that also gives us cause for concern. 'We urge anyone who knows of their whereabouts to contact us as soon as possible so we can reunite Lana-Mai with her concerned mother and make sure that she is safe and well. Earlier, Chief Superintendent Dave Sturman, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Officers attended a domestic incident at 2.20am. There had been a bit of an argument. 'Stuart has taken his daughter in unplanned circumstances. We don't believe there is an immediate threat to the child. 'We urge dad to get in touch with us. Mum is really concerned.'

Here, Sportsmail runs the rule over the Turkish giants and identifies three key men who can dent the Blues' hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals. THE OLD FRIEND . Didier Drogba will make an emotional return to Stamford Bridge on Tuesday but could still do his old employers some damage. He had a quiet night in the first leg in Istanbul where John Terry marshalled him well, but he has scored twice for Galatasaray since that meeting and will want to add to his tally on a ground where he found the net 89 times for Chelsea. Returning hero: Didier Drogba will be back at Stamford Bridge and is certain to get a warm reception . No love lost: Drogba says it will be difficult to play against Chelsea but will do his utmost to win the game . History boy: Drogba was instrumental in Chelsea's Champions League win over Bayern Munich in 2012 . 1-1 after the first leg . Kick-off: 7.45pm, Stamford Bridge . TV & Radio: LIVE on ITV1 from 7.30pm and BBC Radio 5 Live and talkSPORT . Referee: Felix Brych (Germany) CORAL BOOT ROOM BET: Didier Drogba to score — 10-3 . THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY . Wesley Sneijder was linked with a move to Chelsea last summer but the Dutchman opted to go to Turkey instead where he is now one of Galatasaray’s most creative players. In the first leg his corner led to his team’s equaliser and he created more chances than any other player on the pitch. He also knows what it takes to win at Stamford Bridge — in his  only appearance at the ground he helped Inter Milan to a 1-0 win in 2010. His manager that night? Jose Mourinho. The and now: Wesley Sneijder was a key player in Mourinho's Treble-winning Inter Milan side . Maestro: Sneijder's eye for a pass makes him a dangerous opponent in front of the Blues' defence . Three to fear: Drogba (right), Sneijder and Felipe Melo pose for the cameras earlier this season . Tribute: Felipe Melo named his son after Gary Lineker, to the surprise of the former England star . THE GARY LINEKER FAN . Felipe Melo might play in midfield but he always has one eye up front, so much so he named his son after Gary Lineker. Melo explained in 2010: ‘I gave that name [Lineker] to my son because I find it very beautiful.’ Though flattered, Lineker said: ‘Surely with the array of talent within the Brazilian team, he could have named him after someone other than a goal hanger like me!’ Melo has only scored twice all season, but he made more passes in the Chelsea half than any other player in the first leg. CHELSEA’S CENTENARY MAN . If he plays tonight, Petr Cech will be making his 100th appearance in the Champions League, with 88 of those coming for Chelsea and the other 12 for Sparta Prague. Galatasaray will do well to get past the Czech goalkeeper  — he has conceded just 10 goals at Stamford Bridge this season and only one at home in 2014. Interesting method: Petr Cech could make his 100th appearance in the Champions League on Tuesday . Curious: Cech was put through his paces using a tennis racquet and tennis balls at Cobham . Veteran: Cech concedes a penalty from then Barcelona playmaker Ronaldinho back in 2005 . Galatasaray are in good form having lost just one of their last 23 matches. But they have only won four out of 19 away games all season. The Turks also have a miserable record in England. In eight matches they have won just once, drawing three and losing five.","Didier Drogba, Wesley Sneijder and Felipe Melo ones to watch .

A mother-of-three who had unprotected sex says she never dreamed she was at risk of HIV - because 'only African people could get it'. Rachel Dilley, 48, developed the condition nearly a decade ago. Appearing on ITV's This Morning to discuss her diagnosis, she said she hadn't realised at the time that 'white people had ever had it'. She told amazed hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that the risks had genuinely never crossed her mind. Scroll down for video . Naive: Rachel Dilley says she had no idea of the risks of getting HIV - because she thought 'only people in Africa got it' It was in 2004, just short of her 40th birthday, when she embarked on online dating, having split from her partner of 20 years and the father of her children the year before. She began dating a man called Simon* and said the pair seemed to click and get on well. Over the course of the summer, their relationship progressed physically. But because of her age, she says she knew she wouldn't get pregnant - so didn't think about protection. But she also hadn't given a second thought to HIV. 'I didn't know anything about it - I didn't know it was even possible to catch it,' she explained. Stunned: Ms Dilley told amazed This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that the risks had never crossed her mind - because she had never known a white person to get HIV . When quizzed by Philip Scofield about how sex education campaigns and messages had passed her by, she admitted they simply had. Within a few months, the relationship between Ms Dilley and Simon was over - and shortly afterwards she began to feel unwell. 'I had swollen glands, a sore throat, a temperature and couldn't eat properly,' she recalled. 'It was like a really severe bout of the flu.' After tests were inconclusive, it was suggested - to her surprise - she should take an HIV test. 'I thought ""why?"",' she explained. Unwell: Ms Dilley said that a few months after finishing a relationship, she felt like she had 'a severe bout of the flu' - and was eventually urged to take an HIV test . 'I just didn't know anything about it - I just thought you got it in Africa. I didn't know a white person had ever got it.' Her comments were described by Philip as 'extremely naive'. She went on to explain that a week after taking the test, she received the devastating news that she was, indeed, HIV positive. 'I felt like I was walking into a black hole - and my first words were ""am I going to die""? 'It sounds stupid now - as now I know that HIV is not a death sentence. 'My children, who were teenagers at the time, took the news well - as did my mother when she was alive.' Surprise: This Morning host Philip Scofield said Ms Dilley had been 'extremely naive' But she added not everyone has been fine about her diagnosis. 'A friend's daughter didn't want me near her baby. It did upset me at the time, but it just shows that, like me, she wasn't educated on it either.' Today, Ms Dilley takes two drugs in the morning and one in the evening and tries to keep her immune system strong. She also admitted she 'doesn't have much to do with men' - and said people of all ages need to be more aware of the risks of HIV. 'I will not be defined by it [my illness] - people love me for who I am,' she added.

There are many things that can leave you feeling humiliated, but bottling up those feelings could be dangerous. According to retired sociology Professor Thomas Scheff, modern-day society encourages people to be individuals and not let their emotions get in the way. In the journal Cultural Sociology, Professor Scheff said shame is the 'most obstructed and hidden emotion, and therefore the most destructive,' and may have been one of the underlying causes of the Iraq war, and other forms of aggression. Professor Scheff said shame is the 'most hidden emotion, and therefore the most destructive.' He added: 'The Bush administration may have been embarrassed by 9/11 and their helplessness to punish the attackers' and the invasion of Iraq 'might have served to hide their shame behind aggression.' Stock image pictured . 'Emotions are like breathing - they cause trouble only when obstructed,' said the UC Santa Barbara professor emeritus. When hidden, he continued, shame causes serious struggles not only for individuals but also for groups. Scheff suggested that shame - or the . reaction to it - can also manifest itself in larger acts of aggression, such . as wars and other military conflicts. 'Especially for leaders, both shame and anger are carefully hidden behind a veil of rationality,' he said. ‘The . Bush administration may have been deeply embarrassed by the 9/11 attack . during their watch and their helplessness to punish the attackers. The . invasion of Iraq on the basis of false premises might have served to . hide their shame behind anger and aggression.’ In the article, Scheff examined the ubiquity of hidden shame and suggested it may be one of the keys to understanding contemporary society. According to Professor Scheff, a society that fosters individualism is a 'ripe breeding ground for the emotion of shame' because people are encouraged to 'go it alone, no matter the cost to relationships. This feature has constructive and creative sides, but it has at least two other implications: alienation and the hiding of shame' According to Scheff, a society that . fosters individualism is a 'ripe breeding ground for the emotion of . shame' because people are encouraged to 'go it alone, no matter the cost . to relationships.' 'People . learn to act as if they were complete in themselves and independent of . others. This feature has constructive and creative sides, but it has at . least two other implications: alienation and the hiding of shame.' Scheff . continued that while shame is no less prevalent now than in previous . years, decades or generations, it has become more hidden: 'Shame is a . biological entity like other emotions, but people are more ashamed of it . than they are of the others' Professor Scheff said. 'The hiding of emotions is more widespread in modern societies than in traditional ones.' The best way to resolve shame, according to Professor Scheff, pictured, is to 'laugh at yourself or at the universe, but not at other people' In exploring the connection between shame and aggression, Scheff cited research by sociologist Neil Websdale, author of Familicidal Hearts: The Emotional Styles of 211 Killers. Familicide - the act of one spouse killing the other as well as their children and often himself or herself - stems from unacknowledged shame, Professor Scheff claimed. 'It's about humiliation and hiding behind aggression or violence,’ he explained. ‘The most interesting thing about the study is there's a group of non-angry people - a minority - who lose their job and feel humiliated. So they pretend they're going to work every day but are really planning the killing. Websdale describes them as 'civic respectable.' 'Our society is civic respectable,' Professor Scheff added. 'You're not to be angry and you're not to be ashamed.' The problem with that kind of thinking, however, is that shame is, in reality, a very useful emotion. ‘Shame is the basis of morality,’ Scheff said. ‘You can't have a moral society without shame. It provides the weight for morality. There are a hundred things in your head about what you should or shouldn't do, but the one that hits you is the one that has shame behind it.’ While some people are more susceptible to the effects of shame, for others the emotion is more manageable. ‘Those lucky rascals who as children were treated with sympathetic attention from at least one of their caregivers feel more pride - accepted as they are - and, therefore, less shame and rejection,’ Professor Scheff continued. The best way to resolve shame, according to Professor Scheff is to 'laugh at yourself or at the universe, but not at other people.' Most of the laughing we do in comedy is good. No matter the actors, we are really laughing at our own selves that we see in their foolishness.'","Professor Thomas Scheff claimed shame may be to blame for aggression .
He said anger is a result of bottling up feelings of embarrassment .
Societies that promote individualism encourage the emotion of shame .
This is because they preach that it’s fine to 'go it alone' and hide emotions .

A former Miss England who was once taunted for her looks has returned to the beauty pageant scene to help budding models beat the bullies. Jackie Turner, from Bournemouth, was tormented at school by her jealous peers who she said threatened to ""slash my face and cut my hair off"". Now age 30, Jackie recalls the abuse was so bad she was frightened to go to school and almost gave up on her dream of becoming a model. Triumphed: Jackie Turner is proud she didn't let bullies stop her modelling . Beauty pageant success: Jackie took the Miss Dorset and then Miss England crowns after her mother applied for her to take part by sending in pictures . She explained: 'I used to be really camera shy, I remember when I was eight I would hide my face if I saw a camera. My mum used to enter me into local modelling competitions without me knowing and one day I saw my picture in the paper and I had won. I realised then modelling was something I wanted to do. 'The bullying began when I started high school, girls from the years above would call me names and threaten to slash my face and cut my hair off. Tormented: Jackie was bullied at school because of her looks . Taking to the catwalk: She didn't want the bullies to hold her back so took part in beauty pageants . 'I didnâ€™t feel like I was different from any other girl, yet they treated me so horrendously. I used to be so frightened to go to school. They used to spread rumours about me that I was dating all the older boys and stealing them away. I even had drinks thrown over me.' Jackie said she was too scared to tell the teachers and didn't confide in her family as she didn't want to worry them. As the bullying got worse, she started to turn down modelling jobs and became less sociable. Her twin sister, Shelly, knew something was wrong and eventually the truth came out. Global stage: Jackie, second from left, with some of her fellow Miss World contestants in 2003 . Be confident: Older and wiser, right, Jackie wishes her younger self could have known the good things in store thanks to modelling like becoming Miss England, left . Jackie said: 'I was so lonely and sometimes I didn't feel like there was any other way out. Eventually my family and teachers intervened but I still didn't feel safe. I don't know what I would've done without the love and support of my sister and friends.' After school Jackie went on to qualify as a beauty therapist and became a personal trainer whilst taking part in some commercial modelling. In 2003 her mother, Terri, entered her into a beauty pageant, Miss Dorset, without Jackie knowing. Jackie was terrified to enter such a well-known pageant after the years of heartache she had endured at school. But she plucked up the courage to take part and won. Jackie said: 'I loved modelling and I thought it was time to follow my dreams properly again. I didn't want to let the bullies beat me.' Follow in her footsteps: Jackie is organising the Miss Dorset beauty pageant this year . She then went on to take the Miss England crown meaning she could take part in Miss World. 'I was then entered into Miss World and was sent to China to take part. I came 17th out of 108 women which was such an achievement,' she said. 'People imagine pageants to be incredibly lonely but I've never met so many nice women. I was welcomed by strangers and made so many friends.' After her positive experience, Jackie now wants to encourage other young women pursue their dreams and not let bullies stand in their way. She's running this year's Miss Dorset competition so she can support girls keen to follow in her footsteps. Moved on: Jackie said, 'I can't help but laugh now at the girls who used to bully me' She said: 'I can't help but laugh now at the girls who used to bully me. But I wish I could tell the young, vulnerable girl I was back then that we would be okay. Look what we've gone on to achieve. 'I'm running this year's Miss Dorset as I want to help other young girls who have been subjected to bullying because they're doing something they love. 'I want them to know that they shouldn't give up on their dreams like I nearly did. Don't let them beat you.' As well as giving support to the aspiring beauty queens, Jackie also wants to change the reputation of pageants. 'Pageants have such negative press. I want to change that, young girls should be able to be successful and excel in their own right doing something they love,' she said.","Jackie Turner, from Bournemouth, started modelling in her teens .

Clark research into Sutcliffe's activity began when he examined the . unsolved murder of Miss Sewell, who was hit with a pick axe handle and . sexually assaulted in September 1973. Barbara Mayo (left), murdered in 1970, and schoolgirl Judith Roberts (right), killed in 1972, are on the new list of potential Yorkshire Ripper victims . Peter Sutcliffe, who was convicted of 13 murders in 1981, leaves court handcuffed to a prison officer . Mr . Clark said: 'Sutcliffe used to deliver goods for an engineering firm . and regularly used the M1 and routes across the Midlands. 'I managed to obtain a pathology report that had been buried by the police. 'It says the victim sustained massive bruising to her neck and Adam's apple. This is consistent with being garrotted. 'She was then hit around the head with a heavy object. This is a classic mode of attack by the Yorkshire Ripper.' Seventeen-year-old cemetery groundsman Stephen Downing was jailed for Sewell's murder, but his conviction was overturned in 2002, after he spent 27 years in prison. After checking Sutcliffe's logbook and delivery routes as an HGV lorry driver, Mr Clark believes Sutcliffe could gave committed another 22 other attacks nationwide. He also thinks the Ripper could have killed four other women; Barbara Mayo in Chesterfield, Judith Roberts in Tamworth and Rosina Hilliard and Caroline Allen in Leicestershire. Student teacher Barbara Mayo, 24, was found raped, battered and strangled in woods at Ault Hucknall, Derbyshire in October 1970. Her killer has never been brought to justice. Fourteen-year-old schoolgirl Judith Roberts, of Wiggington, Staffordshire was pulled from her bike and beaten to death in June 1972. Soldier Andrew Evans was jailed for her killing but his conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal in 1997 and he was released from prison. Another potential Yorkshire Ripper victim is prostitute Rosina Hilliard, 24, who was found dead at a building site in February 1974. She had been hit by a car, but a post-mortem examination showed somebody had tried to strangle her. It is unknown whether she was killed by the car or the strangulation. The last of Sutcliffe's newly-uncovered potential victims is Carolyn Allen, whose remains were uncovered in 1975 near Old Dalby, Leics. The 17-year-old disappeared the previous year after leaving her home in Bramcote, Nottinghamshire to catch a bus. Her case remains unsolved. Sutcliffe is now a prisoner at Broadmoor Hospital after being given 20 life sentences.","Peter Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women in 1981 .

IT IS a stark choice: whether to suffer the agonies of the lung disease cystic fibrosis, or risk getting cancer after accepting a donor lung from a heavy smoker. As The Mail on Sunday revealed last week, doctors want the lungs of such smokers to be offered more widely to transplant patients in a bid to boost the number of lifesaving operations taking place. Currently, a third of those on the waiting list die before organs become available. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) argues that despite the cancer  risk, cystic fibrosis sufferers should be given the option of having ‘reconditioned’ organs, which could  come from a smoker or those with other diseases. DesperateL Cystic Fibrosis sufferer Poppy Roberts, 23, from Monmouth would rather risk with smoker's lungs after waiting for two years for a transplant . And one CF patient, Poppy Roberts, is certainly willing to take the risk – because for the 23-year-old, time is running out. The average life expectancy for someone put on the lung transplant list is two years – the exact time Poppy has been waiting. ‘I’d rather risk lung cancer in five years’ time than stay in my current situation,’ she says. ‘I can’t afford to be fussy. I don’t know how long I’ve got left – it could be six months.’ Poppy, who dreams of a career in fashion, currently spends two weeks of every month in hospital receiving intravenous antibiotics to halt the infections attacking her body. She  is also reliant on more than 60 different medications a day, and needs to sleep with an oxygen mask at night to help her breathe. ‘Right now, I don’t have a life,’  says Poppy, from Monmouth. ‘If smokers’ lungs would give me a  half decent life for a while, I would take them. On bad days it feels as  if I’m drowning as I’m constantly gasping for breath. ‘I’m dying but there is a chance I could live longer with a smoker’s lungs. Isn’t that what life’s about, taking a chance?’ In 2012, 188 lung transplants were carried out. Yet at any one time there are about 240 people waiting for such an operation. Recent developments in techniques, sometimes dubbed ‘washing’, mean that today just over a third of lung transplants come from patients who smoked. Doctors believe that if rules were relaxed further, up to 100 more lungs a year would become available. These would be from groups designated ‘sub-optimal’ – not considered good enough to donate. Campaigners also want the rules regarding age limits for donors erased, and for lungs from those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes and even hepatitis to be considered viable. ‘Common sense suggests that lungs from a donor who smoked can’t be very healthy, but studies have shown that three-year survival rates following a lung transplant are unaffected by whether or not the donor was a smoker,’ says Andrew Fisher, Professor of Respiratory Transplant Medicine at Newcastle University. ‘Some risk continues to exist, such as development of lung cancer in the donor lung of a smoker. Tiny cancers are not visible on inspection so there is a small chance that such a cancer could be transplanted with the donor lung. But this is a very rare occurrence.’ Donation, donation: The average waiting list for new lungs is two years . The average survival after a lung transplant is six years. ‘It is more important to get a transplant performed than worry about potential risks that may or may not happen  15 years later,’ adds Prof Fisher. In August 2012, there was shock at the lung cancer death of Jennifer Wederell, a 27-year-old CF patient. Sixteen months earlier she had undergone a lung transplant – she later found out that the donor had smoked 20 cigarettes a day throughout their life. Her widower David, 29, says: ‘We got the devastating news of the cancer diagnosis in March 2012. Almost as an afterthought, the consultant revealed that her lung donor had been a smoker. We were incredulous that this hadn’t been mentioned before her transplant.’ Despite what happened, David still believes other CF patients should be given the choice of accepting a smoker’s lungs. ‘I support the CFT in its quest for extended criteria to increase the number of donors. But we have to ensure the transplant process is transparent. Someone else might have accepted a smoker’s lungs  for a chance of life, but Jennifer wouldn’t have risked it.’ Although the number of patients requiring transplants increases every year, the criteria for deciding whether lungs are suitable for operations has changed little in 30 years. Currently only 20 per cent of the donor lungs available in the UK are used for transplant. ‘We don’t try to persuade someone to take a smoker’s lungs, but we offer them a balanced view of any risks and allow them to make the decision,’ says Prof Fisher. Jennifer was never allowed that choice and the hospital that treated her, Harefield, has since apologised and revised its policy on informing patients about the risks of cancer. All donor lungs are carefully assessed according to standard guidance set by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT). Surgeons look at how well oxygen is getting in to the blood, and carry out a chest X-ray to check for signs of infection. During a donor operation, they are able to carry out a visual assessment of the lungs and information about the donor’s smoking history is always collected from the next of kin by a specialist nurse. ISHLT rules say that donors should have smoked no more than one packet  of cigarettes a day for 20 years. Anyone one who has smoked for more than 20 years falls into the category of a ‘marginal’ donor. A technique called Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion, which attaches the lungs to a ventilator that supplies oxygen and mimics breathing and pumps them with a nutrient fluid, allows doctors to further assess the performance of the lungs. ‘Smoking is an easy thing to blame when things go wrong,’ says Prof Fisher. ‘No donor organ is brand new, but in every case we’re confident that the donor lung can function and is good enough to save the life of that patient.’ For Poppy, any set of donor lungs is better than none at all. ‘Until you are on the waiting list you cannot picture what it’s like,’ she says. ‘Given a choice between not having a transplant or receiving the lungs of a smoker, I’d take my chance for a better life rather than live like this.’","Cystic Fibrosis sufferer Poppy Roberts would rather take a smoker's lungs .

A couple told they were unlikely to ever have children - even with the help of IVF - have spoken of their joy at becoming parents. Julia McCarthy, 36, and her husband Mark, overcame 250,000-to-one odds to conceive naturally. They were devastated when Mr McCarthy, 39, was diagnosed with teratozoospermia, a condition which causes sperm to be abnormally shaped. Mrs McCarthy said: ‘The doctor said there was a very remote chance we could conceive, but that the odds were more than 250,000-to-one. Julia and Mark McCarthy overcame odds of 250,000-to-one to conceive baby Alfie naturally . ‘The issue was that Mark’s sperm cells couldn’t fuse with my eggs. It was a practical problem and there wasn’t much we could do about it. ‘There was the option to try a special form of IVF which would track down one suitable sperm cell and inject it into the egg. But the problem was finding the sperm. ‘It would have been a lengthy process and quite invasive on my body, so we decided the odds were just too much for us. ‘We had just started the six-month interview process for adoption when I found out I was pregnant. I didn’t believe it at first.’ Their son Alfie is now 15 months old. Mr and Mrs McCarthy, from Newport-on-Tay, Fife, started planning for a family soon after they married in 2007. The couple were told that even IVF would be difficult because Mr McCarthy has a condition which causes his sperm to be abnormally shaped. They were going through the adoption process when Alfie was conceived . Alfie was born healthy in December 2012 and is now a thriving 15-month-old . Mr McCarthy said: ‘I was the one pushing for children. I’d always wanted to be a dad and I brought up the subject in conversation quite frequently. ‘As we started to settle down, Julia became enthusiastic about the idea.’ Mrs McCarthy said: ‘We were on holiday when we realised that we wanted a child of our own to be with us and share the experience.’ Teratozoospermia is a condition which causes sperm to be abnormally shaped. It is often associated with infertility. In most cases, the cause of the abnormally shaped sperm is not known. However, it can be caused by Hodgkin's disease, coeliac disease and Crohn's disease. The abnormal sperm make traditional IVF unlikely to succeed but some patients can benefit from Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). This is a type of IVF that involves selecting a single, healthy, sperm and injecting it directly into an egg in an effort to succesfully fertilise it. But after two years of trying, the couple realised something was wrong. Mrs McCarthy said: ‘Teratozoospermia is quite rare. The doctor hadn’t heard of it - she had to look it up in a book before she could talk to us. ‘We got used to the idea that natural conception just wasn’t going to happen. But the IVF being suggested seemed quite invasive and a huge effort, and it was not likely to be successful in any case.’ Mr McCarthy said: ‘It was a difficult time for me. Women are often expected to be the ones who are devastated if fertility becomes an issue - men are expected to be shoulders to cry on. But our case was often the opposite. ‘I thought it was my problem and it was quite a lonely place to be, with the way society treats the issue. ‘Women get sympathy, but men with fertility problems are somehow supposed to stand there and accept that it’s their fault. It becomes a point of ridicule. ‘There’s an idea that you’re not even a real man if you can’t create children. Men need to be much more open in talking about these issues and how it affects them.’ Mrs McCarthy said: ‘We realised we wanted children, but the child didn’t need to be ours biologically. 'We got our thoughts together and decided to go for adoption, even though the process was very full-on.’ But then, five months into the process, Mrs McCarthy missed a period and took a pregnancy test. Mrs McCarthy said: 'To find out I had conceived naturally against such odds was very strange. We were surprised and delighted' She said: ‘I ended up taking three . tests at home, and a further test at my GP. Only then did I believe that . I was actually pregnant. ‘It . was overwhelming. We were in ""adoption mode”, so to find out I had . conceived naturally against such odds was very strange. We were . surprised and delighted.’ There were nervous moments during the 26-hour labour in December 2012. Mrs McCarthy’s contractions were unpredictable and Alfie had to be delivered with forceps when his heart rate dropped. Then, after the delivery, Mrs McCarthy needed surgery to remove part of the placenta. But after five days in hospital, the family was able to return home and start their longed-for life together. Mr McCarthy said: ‘I thought I would be crying with joy when Alfie arrived, but I felt a quiet, cautious relief that they were both OK. It was only when they both came home that we were relaxed enough to experience the joy of being parents for the first time.’ The couple are urging other people with fertility problems not to give up as 'good things can, and do, happen' Today, Mr McCarthy, a chef, looks after Alfie at home while Mrs McCarthy works as a college science lecturer. He said: ‘It’s brilliant - but it . comes with challenges. He’s at the moment where he’s learning to walk, . pulling books and CDs from the shelves, so he needs constant watching. ‘I take him to the library every day. He charms everyone he meets - I love taking him out and showing him off to everyone.’ Mrs McCarthy said: ‘The best moment was when the midwife gave me Alfie after the labour. I felt his skin on mine. I remember that moment so vividly. I felt a joy which is impossible to describe. ‘Alfie’s brilliant - he smiles all the time and has a healthy appetite. I feel incredibly close to him, considering all we went through. We had three years of uncertainty and all of a sudden we have a baby boy. Every day we reflect on how lucky we are to have him. ‘It makes me think about other couples who are facing difficulties and heartache with fertility problems. ‘Don’t give up hope - good things can, and do, happen.’","Julia and Mark McCarthy were told they would struggle to conceive .

A new generation of 'super vegetables' with far more nutrients that current plants could soon be on a table near you. Originally designed as a way for astronauts to protect their eyesight in space, the research could lead to a boost for leafy vegetables on Earth. The key to boosting nutrients was to flash plants with bright light. Eat your super-veg: Researchers believe they have found a way to boost the nutrients in leafy vegetables grown in space - and say the same technique could be used on Earth . A lack of water can limit the plant’s ability to use all the sunlight it’s getting for photosynthesis. To keep the excess sunlight from damaging the plant’s biochemical pathways, it produces zeaxanthin, a compound that helps safely remove excess light. Zeaxanthin, which the human body cannot produce on its own, plays a similar protective role in our eyes. While the study is published in an astronautics journal, experts says the findings are applicable on Earth as well and could be especially relevant for future research into plant-based human nutrition and urban food production, which must maximize plant growth in small areas. The findings also highlight the potential for investigating how to prod plants to express traits that are already written in their genetic codes either more fully or less fully. 'Learning more about what plants already ‘know’ how to do and trying to manipulate them through changing their environment rather than their genes could possibly be a really fruitful area of research,' said undergraduate researcher Elizabeth Lombardi of the University of Colorado Boulder. The team found that exposing leafy vegetables grown during spaceflight to a few bright pulses of light daily could increase the amount of eye-protecting nutrients produced by the plants, according to a new study by researchers . One of the concerns for astronauts during future extended spaceflights will be the onslaught of eye-damaging radiation they’ll be exposed to. But astronauts should be able to mitigate radiation-induced harm to their eyes by eating plants that contain carotenoids, especially zeaxanthin, which is known to promote eye health. Zeaxanthin could be ingested as a supplement, but there is evidence that human bodies are better at absorbing carotenoids from whole foods, such as green leafy vegetables. The research could also help maximise the nutrition of vegetables grown in space on missions to planets such as Mars. Using the model plant species Arabidopsis, the team demonstrated that a few pulses of bright light on a daily basis spurred the plants to begin making zeaxanthin in preparation for an expected excess of sunlight. The pulses were short enough that they didn’t interfere with the otherwise optimal growing conditions, but long enough to cause accumulation of zeaxanthin. Arabidopsis is not a crop, but past research has shown that its behavior is a good indicator of what many edible plant species will do under similar circumstances. Current research into space gardening tends to focus on getting the plants to grow as large as possible as quickly as possible by providing optimal light, water and fertilizer. however, this can impact the nutrients they hold. 'There is a trade-off,' said Barbara Demmig-Adams, professor of distinction in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a co-author of the study published in the journal Acta Astronautica. 'When we pamper plants in the field, they produce a lot of biomass but they aren’t very nutritious. 'If they have to fend for themselves—if they have to defend themselves against pathogens or if there’s a little bit of physical stress in the environment—plants make defense compounds that help them survive. 'And those are the antioxidants that we need.' Plants produce zeaxanthin when their leaves are absorbing more sunlight than they can use, which tends to happen when the plants are stressed. For example, a lack of water might limit the plant’s ability to use all the sunlight it’s getting for photosynthesis. To keep the excess sunlight from damaging the plant’s biochemical pathways, it produces zeaxanthin, a compound that helps safely remove excess light. Zeaxanthin, which the human body cannot produce on its own, plays a similar protective role in our eyes. 'Our eyes are like a leaf—they are both about collecting light,' Demmig-Adams said. 'We need the same protection to keep us safe from intense light.'","Technique originally developed for astronauts .

There are few, if any, drawbacks to feeling happy and now a new study has shown that a positive state of mind can boost our brain power. Researchers set out to investigate if a new breed of offices complete with football tables, slides and crazy golf are a waste of time, or whether they boost productivity. The scientists discovered that happy people outperformed their stressed counterparts and were more-efficient employees. Happiness makes you smarter: A new study claims that happy employees outperform unhappy ones and make better software developers (illustrated) in particular . It is well known that good moods can be contagious, but researchers now think that happiness can even spread through the world wide web. American researchers studied social networking interactions over three years and found that positive messages spread through contacts. Researchers, from the University of California analysed more than a billion Facebook status updates, among more than 100 million users, and found that positive statements generated similar messages among friends. And they found that happy messages spread further than miserable ones. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, examined posts by people in cities where it was raining - known to increase the number of negative posts and reduce the number of positive ones - and the impact this had on the status updates of people in cities where it was not raining. To make sure there was no ‘topic contagion’ all weather-related status updates were removed from the analysis. Each additional positive post generated an estimated 1.75 positive posts amongst friends while each additional negative post yielded 1.29 more negative posts. A number of modern workplaces now offer staff fun things to do during their lunchbreak. Google was among the first large firm to incorporate games tables and fun distractions into its offices. While the company has gone from strength to strength, researchers have wondered if the firm’s 'work hard play hard' work ethic has been part of its success. ‘For more than 30 years, it has been claimed that a way to improve software developers’ productivity and software quality is to focus on people and to provide incentives to make developers satisfied and happy. This claim has rarely been verified in software engineering research,’ the study says. Now a team of researchers from the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano in Italy have proved that Google’s strategy is a good one, after collecting data from 42 computer scientists at the university. They tested students to investigate how their emotions and moods affected their programming abilities as well as their creativity and problem solving, IT World reported. ‘Among the many skills required for . software development, developers must possess high analytical . problem-solving skills and creativity for the software construction . process,’ the study says. After . measuring the emotional states of the students using what psychologists . call the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience Affect Balance . (SPANE-B), they tested the creativity of each participant by . asking them to write captions for photographs, which were scored by a . panel of judges. Researchers set out to investigate if a new breed of offices, exemplified by Google (pictured) which come complete with football tables, slides and crazy golf are a waste of time, or whether they boost productivity. They found that happy software developers write better code . They were then asked to play a game to investigate their problem solving skills and the time they took to solve the puzzle provided a score on their analytical capabilities. They failed to show that happiness boosted creativity, but they did find that happy software developers were better at problem solving – a skill highly-prized by businesses such as Google. ‘The empirical data supported a difference in the analytical problem-solving skills of software developers regarding their affective states,’ the study says. ‘More specifically, the results suggest that the happiest software developers are more productive in analytical problem solving performance.’ So it seems that it is worth tech companies investing in fun activities for coders at work.

Tim Peake wants wants the public to help name his 2015 mission to the International Space Station . If you look up at the sky on a clear night, you may see a tiny white light moving across the sky. The light, often mistaken for a low aircraft, is in fact the International Space Station (ISS), hurtling around Earth at speeds of 17,500 miles per hour. Next year, British astronaut Tim Peake will begin his journey into space to spend six months on the ISS – and he wants the public to help name his mission. The journey will make him the first British astronaut to visit the International Space Station as well as the first official Brit in space. The competition, open to all residents of Esa’s member states, follows a long-held tradition in which the public choose mission names every time a European astronaut goes into orbit. Previous mission names have included ‘Marco Polo’ for the Italian Astronaut Roberto Vittori and ‘Odissia’ for Belgian Frank de Winne. Major Peake, 41, said: ‘The ISS is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically, technically and humanly possibly. ‘My six month stay onboard mankind's outpost in space is going to be both challenging and incredibly exciting. Tim Peake said: 'The ISS is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically, technically and humanly possibly' Before joining the Esa astronaut corps in 2009, Major Peake was a helicopter pilot and a test pilot. He was assigned his mission in May 2013 and has been training non-stop to be part of Expedition 46/47 to the orbital outpost. He is following a long line of British explorers and scientists, from the North Pole and the Nile to the Himalayas and now to outer space. ;As a former test-pilot I believe that knowledge is gained when we explore the boundaries of what is technically and humanly possible,' Major Peake said. ‘The scientific experiments conducted will be wide ranging, covering areas such as medicine, human physiology, core science and material science.' The winning entry needs to be short – ideally one or two words or an acronym - and will be incorporated into a logo. Names that reflect an astronaut's nationality are encouraged, but they should also have a wider European flavour, and be easy to pronounce. A team of linguists will also check a shortlist of entries to make sure that seemingly innocent entries are not rude in another European language. Major Peak will then look at the remaining option to make the final choice. An early favourite is ’Beagle 3' - a successor to ‘Beagle 2’, which was the name of the UK's unsuccessful attempt to put a probe on the surface of Mars. Another suggestion is ‘Starman’, inspired by the song of that name by David Bowie. Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said: ‘Tim’s flight is a reminder of humanity’s desire to explore new frontiers – and of the role that Britain has played in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. ‘The naming competition is just one of many opportunities for young people to get involved in a mission that will shape the future of Britain’s space programme and inspire generations.’ The competition closes on 4 April 2014 and can be entered here. Major Peake is due to go to the International Space Station towards the end of 2015 and will spend six months carrying out scientific experiments .","The winning entry needs to be short and will be incorporated into a logo .

It might not look friendly, but a tiny ancient crab-like creature cared for its young 450 million years ago, a newly discovered fossil reveals. The 'nursery in the sea' has revealed a new species with specimens preserved incubating their eggs together with probable hatched creatures huddled close to their bodies. The team of international scientists has named the new species Luprisca incuba after Lucina, goddess of childbirth. The team of international scientists has named the new species Luprisca incuba (pictured) after Lucina, goddess of childbirth, because the ancient crab-like creature incubated her eggs, which are distinguishable as the circular shapes beneath her fossilised body at the bottom of this image . The name also alludes to the fact that the fossils are ancient and in each case the mother was literally sitting on her eggs. The new species is a type of fossilised ostracod, which is part of an animal group related to shrimps, lobsters and crabs was discovered in mudstone rocks from New York State, dating back to the Ordovician period of geological time. Ostracods are tiny crustaceans and are related to thousands of species living in oceans, rivers, lakes and ponds today as well as from countless fossil shells. The nurturing Luprisca incuba is the oldest confirmed occurrence of ostracods in the fossil record, according to the study in the journal Current Biology. Professor David Siveter, Emeritus Professor of Palaeontology at the University of Leicester who led the team of scientists, said: ‘This a very rare and exciting find from the fossil record. Only a handful of examples are known where eggs are fossilised and associated with the parent. The find tells scientists that the ancient tiny marine crustaceans took particular care of their brood (in yellow) in exactly the same way as their living relatives . ‘Only a handful of examples are known where eggs are fossilised and associated with the parent. ‘This discovery tells us that these ancient tiny marine crustaceans took particular care of their brood in exactly the same way as their living relatives.’ The newly discovered fossils are two to three millimetres long and are especially informative because they are exceptionally well preserved, complete with not only the shell but also the soft parts of the animal that in all but very rare cases are lost to the fossil record. Limbs and in some specimens a clutch of eggs are present within the shell, enabling the scientists to identify the gender of some of the ancient creatures. Their anatomical features were preserved in the mineral pyrite and the scientists used x-ray techniques to reveal morphological details hidden within the shells and the rock. The ostracods lived together with other invertebrate animals such as trilobites, in poorly oxygenated conditions in a sea bordering the margins of the ancient North American continent. Professor David Siveter said that like their modern relatives, the ostracods were probably capable of swimming near the sea bed and obtained their food by scavenging and hunting.","A team of international scientists found the 'nursery in the sea' in mudstone rocks from New York State .

A mother says she fears her daughter's addiction to eating carpets and fabric will eventually kill her. Four-year-old Charlotte Cook suffers from autism and the disorder Pica, which makes her want to eat fabric items. She regularly chews on sofas, carpets and cuddly toys to satisfy her cravings. Hungry: Four-year-old Charlotte Cook suffers from autism and the disorder Pica, which makes her want to eat fabric items such as carpet . Damage: Charlotte regularly chews on sofas, carpets and cuddly toys to satisfy her cravings - much to her mother Nikki's despair . Doctors have been unable to treat her for the disorder and her worried mother Nikki claims the family are not getting any support. Pica is characterised by an appetite for substances with very few nutrients, such as ice, clay, chalk, materials, dirt, or sand. It affects around 30 per cent of children with autism and can cause choking, digestive problems and parasitic infections. Experts say it can be caused by a mineral or iron deficiency but it is also classed as a psychiatric disorder. Mrs Cook, 42, said: 'My biggest worry is that it will get clogged up somewhere and kill her. 'It's . like an addiction. She has to do it. The sofas cost Â£2,700 but . Charlotte has ruined them all, along with the scatter cushions. Mrs Cook added: 'She picks the fabric out with her teeth and swallows it. My biggest worry is that it will get clogged up somewhere and kill her' Problem: Charlotte has also started to chew her favourite cuddly toys . 'She picks the fabric out with her teeth and swallows it. 'She has started chewing the arm of the sofa and her cuddly toys as well - which she needs to have or else she has a massive meltdown. 'She also tries to eat the TV remote and her car seat.  The problem is she doesn't realise she is doing it. We feel so alone with this.' Between . 10 and 30 per cent of children aged between one and six have pica - an . eating disorder which is characterised by cravings for non-food items. The disorder is most common in people with developmental disorders, such as autism. It is also common in children between the ages of two and three and in those who have suffered a brain injury. People . with pica frequently crave and eat items such as dirt, paint, chalk, . clay, coffee grounds, cigarette butts, hair and sand.The condition can sometimes result in serious health problems, such as lead poisoning. Mrs Cook and her husband Alasdair were stunned after Charlotte began eating carpets in the family home when she was just a year old. Around the same time, she also started to show the first signs of autism. Mrs Cook, from Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, said: 'We always knew that something wasn't quite right with Charlotte. 'We had a big green rug in the front room and when she was a year old she started eating it. 'I told the health visitor about it and she said to take the rug out of the room. 'We thought that would be the end, of it but she gradually started doing it with the carpet in her own room. 'Then she started going into her sister's room and doing it there. Around October last year, she started with the sofas.' Experts have struggled to find a solution to the unusual problem, leaving Mr and Mrs Cook to fear for their daughter's health. One expert suggested removing all fabric items from the house - an option which family can't afford. Mrs Cook, who works as a self-employed sports therapist, said: 'We have told her calmly that she can't do it or she will be sick but that has no effect. We have tried everything. 'All the doctors have told us is that if she gets a high temperature or goes limp to take her straight to A&E. That's what we are dealing with on a daily basis. Her mother added: 'It's like an addiction, she has to do it. The sofas cost Â£2,700 but Charlotte has ruined them all, along with the scatter cushions' 'I can't begin to explain how much of a worry it is.' The family are now trying to raise awareness of the condition in the hope of finding a way to help Charlotte. Mrs Cook, who is also mother to Evelyn, six, added: 'Alasdair and I work hard, but there is no help out there. 'We can't afford to replace the sofas or the carpet because there's no assistance for working parents. 'We want to make people aware of the condition because it is rarely publicised. 'Some people make me feel as if Charlotte is a freak but she is my daughter and I would do anything for her.'","Charlotte Cook suffers from both autism and the condition Pica .

When it senses danger, Earth sends out huge plumes of plasma to protect itself against devastating solar storms. And now, for the first time, scientists have been able to watch this incredible process using satellites and ground-based detectors. The discovery confirms age-old theories about the Earth's magnetic field and could provide scientists with a way to better to model the planet’s natural shield. Spacecraft have observed how dense particles can 'snake up' along magnetic field lines as cold plasma . Earth’s protective field, known as the magnetosphere, extends thousands of miles into space affecting everything from global communication to animal migration. When the sun's magnetic field directly links with Earth's, it can create cracks in the magnetosphere allowing solar winds to punch holes into the ozone layer. Usually this creates auroras in the sky, but it can also knock out power grids, radically change Earth’s climate and drive up rates of cancer. A thin layer of cold, dense material called the plasmasphere surrounds Earth. Researchers have found that material in the plasmasphere can help prevent particles from the sun crossing into near Earth space . The Earth's plasmasphere is an inner part of the magneteosphere - the protective magnetic bubble are Earth. It is a region of dense, cold plasma that surrounds the Earth. Although plasma is found throughout the magnetosphere, the plasmasphere usually contains the coldest plasma. In certain circumstances dense particles in the plasmasphere send a . plume up to meet – and help block – incoming solar material. In certain circumstances dense particles in a layer of the uppermost atmosphere called the plasmasphere send a plume up to meet – and help block – incoming solar material. ‘It’s like what you might do if a monster tried to break into your house,’ said Brian Walsh, a space scientist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center. ‘You’d stack furniture up against the front door, and that’s close to what the Earth is doing here. ‘The material that is usually much nearer Earth stacks up against the outer boundary of the magnetosphere, throttling the interaction there and stopping solar material from entering.’ While ground-based measurements can see a plume forming, their resolution isn't good enough to confirm whether the material reaches the magnetic boundary. The Earth's plasmasphere is an inner part of the magneteosphere - the protective magnetic bubble are Earth that shields against solar winds . In January last year, GPS sensors on the ground mapped electrons in the upper atmosphere and saw a tendril of electron density moving away from the North Pole. Through sheer luck, three of Nasa's Themis spacecraft, which are designed to study solar storms, crossed through the magnetic boundary at that very moment. The Themis craft saw a 100-fold increase in the number of electrons at the boundary, indicating that a plume of plasma was veering off towards the sun. Eventually these observations could lead to improvements in space weather predictions, which would be as useful for spacecraft operators as terrestrial weather forecasts are for us here on Earth.

Forget million pound shuttle launches - all you need to go into space is a balloon, 24 GoPro cameras and an Oculus Rift headset. At least that’s the plan behind an ambitious project, dubbed ‘Virtual Ride to Space’, being developed by engineers in the UK. The group hopes to use the equipment to give anyone a virtual ride into outer space for £40 ($67) Scroll down for video... 24 GoPro Hero3 cameras will be attached to a balloon and sent 12.5 miles (20km) into the air. At this height the balloon will burst, a parachute will open and the cameras will drift back to Earth while filming . ‘Only 530 people have ever travelled to space. Well, lucky them... but what about the rest of us?', the group wrote on their Kickstarter page. ‘This project is about enabling us, the remaining 99.999992 per cent, to get that experience.' The plan by the team at Surrey University sounds relatively simple: 24 GoPro Hero3 cameras will be attached to a balloon around 12.5 miles (20km) into the air. The cameras will be encased in Styrofoam alongside sensors, an SD card to store the video and a battery pack. If all goes to plan, at this height the balloon will burst, a parachute will open and the cameras will drift back to Earth while filming.

This is approximately 767 mph at sea level, and helped the craft reach an altitude of 71,000ft above the Mojave Air and Space Port in California . This will provide a 360-degree video that can be viewed with Oculus Rift as if the user were in a vessel heading back down to Earth. The software will allow anyone to speed up, slow down and reverse time, and even comes with its own musical soundtrack. Lead researcher Dr Aaron Knoll from the University of Surrey said: ‘For this project the experience is everything, so we're going with the cutting edge of available technology.’ The Oculus Rift, developed by Oculus VR, is a virtual reality headset, which delivers a high definition 3D virtual environment for the user. Versions of the software will also be available for smartphones and PCs, for those who don’t have access to an Oculus Rift. Smartphone users will be able to look around by tilting their devices, while the experience on PCs will be controlled via mouse. The project is now on Kickstarter where £40 ($67) will secure you a ‘ride’ to space. The group hope to raise £30,000 ($50,100) to get the project off the ground.

Through the use of the headset, and a series of first-person cameras, the system creates the illusion that partner A can see what is being recorded by the visor worn by partner B, and vice versa. One member of the couple is called the user, while the other is the performer. Through the Oculus Rift goggles, the user is shown a video stream taken from the perspective of the performer's eyes. Each couple agrees on a set of synchronised movements and the partner's mirror each others hand gestures, and so on, while wearing the headsets. By mimicking movements, it creates an illusion in the brain that what the performer is seeing, is actually being seen through the eyes of the user.","Plan is to send 24 cameras attached to balloon 12.5 miles above Earth .

The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have closed in Sochi with a ceremony every bit as grand and gaudy as the Winter Olympics themselves. Watched over by President Putin, nearly 460 artists danced, swung and sang their way through a display based around the slogan 'reaching the impossible'. The Fhist stadium was lit up with the word Impossible, before Alexey Chuvashev, wheelchair athlete and medal winner of the London 2012 Paralympic Games, climbed a 15-metre rope to place an apostrophe which changed the word into 'I'm Possible'. Scroll down for video . Inspired: The Sochi Winter Paralympic closing ceremony with disabled athlete Aleksey Chuvashev scaling a 15-metre rope to drop a comma into the word Impossible to make it read I'm Possible . Stunning: The word was spelled out using tiles shaped like pieces from the classic computer game Tetris . All action: The show also featured wheelchair dancers, trapeze artists, skateboarders and parkour runners . Watching over: President Putin watches 460 performers, who rehearsed for months to ensure the show ran smoothly, sung, swung and danced through the ceremony in the Fisht stadium . Talent: The show also featured an a cappella performance of the Russian Federation anthem by a children's choir, some of whom had disabilities . The event also featured stunning parkour performers who ran and jumped their way across the stadium floor, as well as bicyclists, skateboarders, and trapeze artists. The aerial acrobats featured alongside a group of performers the Russian Federation of Wheelchair Sport Dancing in the opening section of the show which was directed by the creative duet of Konstantin Vasilyev, coach of world and European champions in wheelchair sport dance, and Phil Hayes, world-renowned aerial choreographer. After the Russian flag was raised, the Russian Federation anthem was performed by the Children's Choir of the All-Russian Choral Society. The choir united 100 gifted children from choral and musical schools from various corners of Russia, including 35 young singers with an impairment, who performed the anthem a cappella. Great Britons: British Paralympic skier Jade Etherington, who is visually impared and won silver on the first day of the games in the downhill event, carried the Union Flag into the stadium .

Tinder is set to introduce a verification system after is emerged Hollywood celebrities are flocking to the site. It is believed Jamie Kennedy, Lindsay Lohan, Ashton Kutcher and Josh Groban all use the app. Now it will introduce a system similar to Facebook and Twitter to prove their identity. What's he doing on tinder? Ashton Kutcher is believed to be a user of the app - despite his relationship with Mila Kunis . Tinder CEO Sean Rad told The Hollywood Reporter celebs were struggling to make matches because people assumed they were fake. Tinder requires users to create profiles through Facebook, but 'sometimes celebrities use different names on Facebook,' he said. 'This will allow celebrities to enter Tinder in a different way.' Rad says he had been told some Tinder users congregated near the Dolby Theatre on Oscar Sunday in the hope of matching with a celebrity. Tinder chief marketing officer Justin Mateen adds that its double opt-in system -- users can chat only after both 'swipe right' - makes it a safe space for stars: . 'Tinder gives them the control to filter through the noise and communicate with people they want to know.' The app is now matching 5 million people per day,  and users are swiping through 750 million profiles a day, its founder has revealed. Founder and CEO Sean Rad claims the apps success is down to it being 'like the real world but better'. He also told users that the profile picture was key - and that 'headshots don't work' on the site. Dating app Tinder is now matching 5 million people per day,  and users are swiping through 750 million profiles a day, its founder has revealed. Sean Rad, founder and CEO of Tinder, said headshots were a bad idea on the site . Speaking at Upfront Summit in Los Angeles, Rad said Tinder started about a year and half ago because friends realized they were having trouble meeting people. He told the conference 'In the real world we send out signals subconsciously to people if we're interested or not,' 'We wanted to build something that makes that the norm,' he said, according to MarketingLand. 'it's really an analog to what we do in the real world .. it's like the real world but better' Rad also revealed the firm is now approaching a billion matches since it started. When asked what profile's worked best, he also admitted the service was picture-led. 'It's all about the picture,' he said, and claimed the app maker is not ashamed of that.' He advised people to choose their picture carefully. He also advised people to talk about friends and interests they have in common - information they wouldn't have in a 'real world' meeting. On average users open the app seven times a day - with almost a billion matches since it launched 18 months ago . He also admitted headshots were a bad choice. 'Headshots don't work. 'People like to see personality in Tinder photos, they want photos of say you skiing, rather than modeling, that expresses what you actually do.' He also said users on average open the app seven times a day. Rad said the key to success was a profile pic that revealed someone's personality - and to talk about shared friends with a match . Part of the apps recent success has been down to the 'Sochi effect' when athletes in the winter Olympics told of the apps popularity in the athlete's village. Rad told the Wall Street Journal that Tinder saw a 400 percent day-over-day spike in growth during the Sochi Games.

Slow progrerss: Miss Parsons' problems started at 23 when she began to suffer from symptoms associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and migraines. She also has type 1 diabetes and doctors believed the two problems were linked . She claims she will become paralysed if nothing is done to prevent her body from collapsing. Doctors also believe she is suffering from a condition called Cervical Cranio Instability. This . means her neck is not strong enough to hold up her head and her brain . stem is slowly being crunched by the pressure from her skull, causing her to shrink. The former make-up artist is now attempting to raise £70,000 to fund an operation in America after losing her battle with the NHS to have treatment here.

I just wanted surgical help to get my life back and be the independent driven women I used to be, not being sick, in pain and stuck on benefits all my life. 'Wearing a hard collar is very uncomfortable, restrictive, and hot, but it allows me to get out of bed some days and sometimes it is the only indication that I am very sick. 'The smallest journey is living hell, inflicting vibration and jarring to my body, so even hospital appointments are huge pain filled ordeals.

'If I do not get surgery I will eventually be paralysed and die It’s the only chance I have at a normal life.' Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited conditions that affect collagen proteins in the body causing them to be weak. Typical features are stretchy skin, loose joints and fragile body tissues. Collagen . is a building block that strengthens and supports various body tissues - . it is found in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, bone, blood vessels . and the spine. EDS is caused by alterations in certain genes - these can be passed from parents to their children. The condition affects at least one person in every 5,000 in the UK. There . are various different forms of EDS. All share some common features, . such as loose joints, abnormal skin and fragile body tissues, but each . form of EDS has unique characteristics too. The most severe form is Vascular EDS which causes the organs and blood vessels to be at risk of rupturing - this can be fatal. Source: NHS Choices . Her problems started at 23 when she began to suffer from symptoms associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and migraines. Miss Parsons also has Type 1 Diabetes doctors believed the two problems were linked. So she carried on with as normal a life as possible, setting up her own bridal make-up business, meeting a long-term boyfriend and getting engaged. At 26 she could no longer ignore the nausea and headaches that had come to accompany her stomach problems and returned to her doctors who diagnosed her with stress and dismissed her as a hypochondriac. It was only then, when she felt like no-one was taking her seriously, that she began to look elsewhere to solve the mystery of her health problems. Things took a turn for the worse when she fell down a set of wooden steps a year later. Suffering from severe whiplash, her migraines worsened and she began to find it difficult to track objects with her eyes. After spending thousands of pounds of her savings on tests and doctors, her diagnosis finally came at 29 with a simple test to see how flexible she was. Hypermobility is one of the markers of Nina’s type of EDS. Her super flexible limbs and the way she can put her hands flat on the floor without bending her legs confirmed it. She had always been more flexible than the average child, excelling at gymnastics at school, and had been able to pull her thumb in and out of its socket without any pain - but had thought it was normal. But her headaches remained unexplained. In desperation she went online and found a specialist clinic in America who, after seeing her MRI scans, believe she also suffers from Cervical Cranio Instability linked to her EDS.

The Dyson Air Multiplier fan which is the 'near silent' update to its bladeless fan that it claims is quieter than a buzzing mosquito . Dyson experts have launched a new bladeless fan that is 75per cent quieter and eliminates the tone that equates to the irritating mosquito hum. However the sound of silence does not come cheaply, for the designer fan ranges in price from £219.99 to £299.99 depending on the size and style. The company has spent some £40million on developing its Air Multiplier bladeless fans, which come from laboratories that employ 1,500 scientists and engineers. The new design Dyson Cool fans includes an innovation called a Helmholtz cavity, which effectively dissipates some of the sound waves caused by the fan. The engineers identified which tone was the most irritating to the human ear, which is equivalent to a mosquito’s beating wind, and have managed to kill this. They have also smoothed the airflow through the fan, which reduces turbulence and so further reduces noise. The combined effect of the changes has also made the fans some 40per cent more energy efficient, so reducing the running costs. The design has been called an 'innovation' that helps to dissipate sound waves, and Smoother airflow also helps the fan in noise reduction .","Dyson spent £40 million on developing the bladeless fan .

China has showed its growing impatience with Malaysia over the hunt for missing jet MH370 and warned it must 'immediately' expand the search. As the list of countries involved in the hunt rose to 26, China's Foreign Ministry said Malaysia needs to clarify the scope of the operation which now covers an area the size of Africa. Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular briefing in Beijing that China's ambassador to Malaysia met Malaysia's foreign minister on Monday. Missing: China has warned Malasia must step up the search for the Boeing 777-200ER Malaysia that disappeared on March 9 . No trace of the plane has been found . more than a week after it vanished but investigators believe it was . diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and commercial . navigation. Satellite data suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two vast arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan, or a southern arc from Indonesia into the Indian Ocean west of Australia. 'Of course search and rescue efforts have become even harder now, and the area is much bigger,' Hong said. 'We hope that Malaysia can provide more thorough, accurate information to countries participating.' Hong declined to comment when asked if China is checking into the backgrounds of the Chinese passengers on board in search of suspicious histories. He declined to say whether China is searching over Tibet and the western region of Xinjiang for the jet, or whether China has ruled out that the plane entered its airspace. About two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight were Chinese.

Malaysian investigators are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on the missing Boeing 777-200ER for clues as to why someone on board flew it perhaps thousands of miles off course. Today, Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein reiterated his country is doing all it can and finding the jet is its 'first priority'. He also repeated Malaysia's rejection of suggestions it is holding information back. 'The fact that . there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming . responsibility, there is always hope,' Hishammuddin said. The Ministry of Transport in Kuala Lumpur today issued a revised . list of the countries that are helping physically with aircraft and ships or by . examining data that might help pinpoint the fate of MH370. The revised list, increased yesterday from 14 . to 25, has now grown to 26. The countries are Malaysia, Australia, . Bangladesh, Brunei, China, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, . Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Myanmar, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, . Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Turkmenistan, UAE, UK US, Uzbekistan and . Vietnam. Assistance requested from all these countries, . where applicable, is radar and satellite information, land, sea and aerial . search operations and search and rescue action plans of those countries. MALAYSIA . Malaysia, which is co-ordinating the search, has deployed about 18 aircraft and 27 ships, including the submarine support vessel MV Mega Bakti, which can detect objects at a depth of up to 3,280ft (1,000m). AUSTRALIA . Australia has sent two AP-3C Orion aircraft, one of which is searching the waters to the north and west of the Cocos Islands. Australia's defence department is refusing to say whether Malaysia has asked Australia to divulge any radar information, but Prime Minister Tony Abbott said all Australian agencies 'are scouring their data to see if there's anything they can add to the understanding of this mystery'. CHINA . An official with the Chinese Civil Aviation Authority says the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace. The Chinese Defence Ministry and Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to questions on radar information. China has deployed nine navy ships and civilian patrol vessels and a variety of fixed wing and rotary aircraft, along with a team of experts dispatched to Malaysia. UNITED STATES . A P-8A Poseidon, the most advanced long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft in the world, has been searching in the Indian Ocean. The US Navy has also deployed the destroyer USS Kidd with two MH-60R helicopters. INDONESIA .

With a diet that included plenty of fruit and cereal, Murray Young, 56, a secure vault officer from Hornchurch in Essex thought he was eating a reasonably healthy diet. But despite a lifetime of dieting, he continued to pile on the pounds - eventually tipping the scales at an uncomfortable 18st 5lb. The reason? Although eating an ostensibly 'balanced' diet, Murray was actually consuming between 6,000 and 8,000 calories every single day. Unhealthy: Murray Young, pictured with his wife Helena, was eating between 6,000 and 8,000 calories a day . Now the father-of-one is to appear with his wife Helena on Channel 4 documentary, Secret Eaters, and says he was horrified to discover how much he was really eating. 'On one particular day, I'd eaten more 8,000 calories,' he confesses. 'I was shocked to the core. I . felt disgusted to tell you the truth.' The problem, as Murray is only too willing to admit, was a lack of knowledge about what healthy really means, and as a result, foods such as jam and cream formed a recurring part of his menu. 'For breakfast I'd have Special K with . bananas and sultanas and then pour double cream on top,' he says. 'I thought it was . healthy because of the Special K in there. 'I was eating semi-correctly or believing I was. I thought I was eating plenty of fruit and salad. I thought if I ate one piece of fruit a day, then I was eating healthily.' Not so good: Murray's take on eating Special K cereal involved lashings of double cream and jam . Favourite: Fried chicken used to be a favourite of Murray's, as did the equally greasy fish and chips . While it might sound like a lot, racking up 8,000 calories in a single day isn't as hard as you might think. Here's how you could do it. 8,000 calories is equal to: . 46 Cadbury's Creme Eggs (173.6 calories each) 168 apples (47.5 calories each) 16 Big Mac burgers, no fries or drink (490 calories) 14 12"" Margherita pizzas (594 calories each) 23 portions of Chinese chicken and cashew nuts (343 calories per serving) 16 300g servings of Chicken Korma, no rice (490 calories per portion) 96 slices of brown bread (82.8 calories per slice) 27.5 Danish pastries (287 calories each) 114 digestive biscuits (70.5 calories each) 1142 30g portions of steamed broccoli (Seven calories each) 88 glasses of Champagne (91.2 calories each) 105 rashers of bacon (76 calories each) 41 portions of fillet steak (191 per 100g) Source: Weightlossresources.co.uk . The reality was somewhat different. Along with healthy fruit and vegetables, Murray was eating a diet crammed with fried chicken, Chinese takeaways and family-sized apple pies. 'Murray’s calorie intake was huge, . mainly as a result of his huge portion sizes at meal times, snacking and . picking on fatty foods between meals, his regular takeaways, drinking . sugary drinks and his alcohol intake,' explains nutritionist Lynne Garton. 'As a result the balance was in . favour of lots of fatty and sugary foods and drinks, with very little . fruit and vegetables. 'In fact he only ate 4.5 portions of fruit and . vegetables across the whole of surveillance [five days], compared to the recommended . amount of at least five portions a day.' 'For breakfast, I would eat cereal . liberally smothered with double cream,' admits Murray. 'Sometimes I'd put jam on it, . thinking jam is healthy because it's made from fruit, or would have golden syrup on it. 'Then, for a . mid-morning snack, I would take some bacon and grill it. I thought if I added . some tomatoes to it, it would be OK to have an enormous baguette. 'For . lunch, if I was close to home,  I'd go . and have chicken and chips, and then, if I had a day off, would carry on and have fish . and chips as well. 'At work, I would take as much food as possible as I could: three sandwiches and a large apple . pie, for a family of four, to keep me going through the shift.  If we . had downtime, I'd  have McDonalds too.' Since being confronted with the full . extent of his calorie intake, Murray has managed to lose two stone, . following what he describes as an 'idiot proof' diet, but says more needs . to be done to educate people about what healthy eating really consists . of. New diet: Since his appearance on Secret Eaters, Murray (pictured with Anna Richardson) has lost 2st . Overhaul: Lynne Garton gave Murray what he describes as an 'idiot proof' diet . 'Helena and I talk about healthy eating a lot and we . always say that people don't know enough,' he explains. 'I think there's a lot of people like me out there, who started . putting on weight in their early 20s and don't know how to get rid of it and avoid things like diabetes. 'I want to tell people to put the . brakes on, have a search . round and find an NHS eating programme and discuss their diet with someone. 'Even if you aren't concerned about gaining weight, I'd still say put the brakes on and say stop.' For Murray, a healthier diet has already paid dividends, in terms of both his weight and self-confidence. Indeed, so much better does he feel since the start of his healthy new regime, he's even taken up dancing - something he never felt able to do before. 'I get a real buzz from the . fact I can do it,' he says. 'I just feel so much healthier. I've never . danced before but now I've joined a swing-jive class.! 'I'd never have done that in a . million years but walked in bold as brass and said, ""what are we doing, . let's get started!"".' Touchingly, he adds: 'I love it. Since I went on the diet, it's as if someone has opened a door and I've walked into a different world.' Secret Eaters begins on Wednesday 12th March at 8pm on Channel 4 . DON'T SKIP MEALS . Eat regularly by having a breakfast, lunch and evening meal, possibly with one or two healthy snacks in between if needed. Regular meals, based on nutritious foods, will help keep blood glucose stable and prevent becoming over hungry that can lead to overeating. BALANCE IS KEY . Get the balance right and fill up on fruits, vegetables and wholegrain foods, with moderate amounts of low fat dairy and protein-packed foods such as lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, lentils and nuts . DON'T BE TOO PURITANICAL . Don’t deny yourself of treats. 'Treat’ foods can still be included as part of a healthy, balanced diet. Knowing you can still enjoy these foods, albeit in small quantities, can prevent you from feeling deprived, helping the diet to be sustainable. EXERCISE PORTION CONTROL . When thinking about serving your meal on a plate, mentally divide the plate into quarters. Serve your vegetables first to fill half your plate, your starchy foods such as rice, potatoes or pasta should cover a quarter and the remaining quarter with your protein foods. STAY HYDRATEDHaving enough to drink is important for good health. But to make sure you’re not getting extra calories from drinks, don’t add sugar to teas and coffees, and choose low calorie or diet versions of your favourite drink. Even better choose water which is convenient, cheap and calorie-free.","Murray Young, 56, thought he was eating a balanced diet filled with fruit .

Recent extreme weather events have highlighted just how important it is to understand our planet’s behaviour. And now a new space mission could help do just that by providing real-time measurements of rain and snow every three hours, all over the world. The constellation of satellites will help fill huge gaps in precipitation observations as large areas of the Earth currently do not have radar coverage. The satellite has unprecedented range, and will scan the skies between 65 degrees north and south latitude . The mission, known as Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), will also help scientists look through storms to see the internal dynamics and intensity of a hurricane. The satellite has unprecedented range, and will scan the skies between 65 degrees north and south latitude. Currently, Nasa’s Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) provides scientists with detailed data on rainfall and storms. But the problem is it only covers a relatively narrow range. For instance, Hurricane Sandy could only be tracked by TRMM until it passed Florida before going out of range. The first satellite of the constellation, known as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory, was launched on Thursday by Nasa and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) While TRMM measures precipitation in the tropics, the new constellation will also expand the coverage area from the Arctic Circle to the Antarctic Circle. This is vital to understanding extreme events, like blizzards, floods and droughts which have wreaked havoc across the globe in recent months. The first satellite of the constellation, known as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory, was launched on Thursday by Nasa and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa). ‘With this launch, we have taken another giant leap in providing the world with an unprecedented picture of our planet's rain and snow,’ said Nasa administrator Charles Bolden. ‘GPM will help us better understand our ever-changing climate, improve forecasts of extreme weather events like floods, and assist decision makers around the world to better manage water resources.’ GPM is one of the ¿core¿ satellites in the constellation and will be carrying an advanced radar and radiometer system to measure precipitation from space. Pictured is the launch which took place on Thursday . GPM will also be able to detect light rain and snowfall, a major source of available fresh water in some regions. ‘We still have a lot to learn about how rain and snow systems behave in the bigger Earth system,’ said GPM project scientist Gail Skofronick-Jackson of Goddard. ‘With the advanced instruments on the GPM Core Observatory, we will have for the first time frequent unified global observations of all types of precipitation, everything from the rain in your backyard to storms forming over the oceans to the falling snow contributing to water resources.’ GPM is one of nine satellites in the constellation and will be carrying an advanced radar and radiometer system to measure precipitation.

Despite bans on almost all production of similar gases under a 1987 treaty, they were found in Greenland's ice and in air samples in Tasmania, Australia. Experts are trying to pinpoint industrial sources of tiny traces of the new gases, and believe they may have been used in making pesticides or refrigerants. In 2002 the ozone hole split into two pieces. Now scientists have detected four new man-made gases that damage the Earth's protective ozone layer . Nasa and NOAA have been monitoring the ozone layer on the ground and with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the 1970s. Long-term ozone monitoring instruments have included TOMS, SBUV/2, Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment series of instruments, the Microwave Limb Sounder, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, and the OMPS instrument on the Suomi NPP satellite. The ozone layer shields the planet from damaging ultra-violet rays, which can cause skin cancer and eye cataracts, and has been recovering after a phase-out of damaging chemicals under the U.N.'s 1987 Montreal Protocol. 'The concentrations are not yet a threat to the ozone layer,' lead author Johannes Laube of the University of East Anglia in England told Reuters of the three types of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbon) and one HCFC (hydrochlorofluorocarbon). In total, the scientists estimated more than 74,000 metric tons of the four had been released to the atmosphere. None was present before the 1960s in Greenland's ice cores, according to the study in the journal Nature Geoscience. That is only a small fraction of the million metric tons of CFCs produced every year at a 1980s peak, according to the team of scientists in Britain, Germany, Australia, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Laube said it was unknown if the emissions of the new gases were illegal, since the Montreal Protocol has some exemptions. 'We hope to tighten the loopholes,' he said. A fridge too far: Researchers believe the new gases may have come from fridges or pesticides . A hole in the ozone layer was found in the 1980s over Antarctica but bans on damaging chemicals, for instance used in hairsprays, foams and refrigerants, means it is on target to recover in the next 50 years. HCFCs have often been used to replace more damaging CFCs. One of the newly discovered CFCs was worrying since concentrations were rising fast, Laube said. Such emission increases had not been spotted for other CFCs since the 1990s. The gases were detected earlier in Greenland than Tasmania, indicating they were produced in the northern hemisphere and then blown south. Research planes, taking air samples around the world, may be able to find the sources, Laube said. 'While these newly discovered gases can, in theory, cause some damage to the ozone layer, their combined abundance is over 500 times smaller than that of the main ozone-destroying compounds in the 1990s,' said Martyn Chipperfield, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Leeds. 'These new observations do not present concern at the moment, although the fact that these gases are in the atmosphere and some are increasing needs investigation,' he said. Laube said the gases are also likely to be powerful greenhouse gases, albeit in tiny amounts. CFCs are often thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.","Found in Greenland's ice and in air samples in Tasmania, Australia .

A breakthrough technology that helps blind people 'see' the world around them using sound is now available in a smartphone app. The vOICe system converts images taken on a mobile into 'soundscapes' by assigning different musical notes and pitches to different shapes. For example, a diagonal line - such as staircase - is converted to a string of rising musical notes. The app, available on Android, uses the phone's camera to record scenes and landscapes, and teaches users how to identify which sounds go with which shapes. There is even an accompanying app called EyeMusic that adds colour to these shapes. The vOICe system converts images into 'soundscapes' by assigning different musical pitches to different shapes. For example, a diagonal line is converted to a string of rising musical notes. The app is available on Android, pictured, and explains how users can train themselves to identify the shapes . During tests, head-mounted cameras were attached to the blind participants before being wired up to a computer and microphone. As the participants moved around the room, the camera took a photo and converted into a 'soundscape'. It uses pitch for height and loudness for brightness by scanning the room from left to right. A rising bright line is converted into a rising tone, a bright spot - such as a lamp - is a beep, a brightly filled rectangle - such as a window during daylight - becomes a noise burst and a vertical grid  - such as waffle or trellis - is converted into a rhythm. Users are trained to identify which pitch relates to which height, for example. They then listen to, and interpret, the visual information . coming from the camera - effectively 'seeing' with sounds. After . being taught how to use the technology, blind people could use the devices to . learn to read, with sounds representing visual images of letters, for example. The EyeMusic app uses the same principles, but additionally assigns different pitches to colours. The vOICe system was created by Dutch engineer Peter Meijer in 1992. It uses pitch for height and loudness for brightness by scanning the room from left to right. A rising bright line is converted into a rising tone, a bright spot - such as a lamp - is a beep, a brightly filled rectangle - such as a window during daylight - becomes a noise burst and a vertical grid  - such as waffle or trellis - is converted into a rhythm. Since 2007, neuroscientist Professor Amir Amedi from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been training blind people how to use this technology. With around 70 hours training, Professor Amedi's participants recognise the presence of a human form. They are also able to . detect the exact posture of the person in an image, and imitate it. Using brain scans, Professor Amedi was able to establish the outlines and . silhouettes of bodies cause the visual cortex in his participants' brains - an area specifically dedicated in sighted people to processing body . shapes - to light up with activity. The vOICe for Android app makes this technology widely available. It uses augmented reality to convert live camera views to soundscapes for the totally blind through sensory substitution and computer vision. Using vOICe, researchers have also created EyeMusic for iOS, pictured. It translates black and white images created by vOICe into colour. Colours are represented by different musical instruments - higher pixels are translated into higher notes while lower pixels are translated into lower notes on the same instrument . Researchers first taught people to perceive simple dots and lines. Then those individuals learned to connect the lines with junctions or curves, gradually working up to more and more complex images, pictured . The app also features a talking colour identifier, talking compass, talking face detector and a talking GPS locator, while CamFind visual search and Google Goggles can be launched from the vOICe for Android app by tapping the left or right screen edge. In Professor Amedi's most recent work, he has taken this a step further and created the EyeMusic app for iOS devices. It uses an algorithm to translate the original black and white images created by vOICe into colour. Colours are represented using different musical instruments - higher pixels of an image are translated into higher notes on a given musical instrument, for example, higher pitches on the piano, trumpet or the violin, while lower pixels of an image are translated into lower notes on the same instrument. Video: How the vOICe technology appears to blind people . The . researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem first taught people to perceive simple dots and lines. Then . those individuals learned to connect the lines with junctions or . curves, gradually working up to more and more complex images. Professor Amedi's team taught congenitally blind . adults, meaning adults who were born blind, to use what's called sensory substitution . devices (SSDs). For . example, when a person uses a visual-to-auditory SSD, images from a . video camera are converted into 'soundscapes' that represent the images. This allows the user to . listen to and then interpret the visual information coming from the . camera, in that way 'seeing' with sounds. After . being taught how to use the SSDs, blind people could use the devices to . learn to read, with sounds representing visual images of letters. This . skill involved a region of the brain called the Visual Word Form Area . (VWFA), which in sighted people is activated by seeing and reading . letters (pictured) After . only tens of hours of training, blind people's VWFA showed more . activation for letters than for any of the other visual categories . tested. Pixels closer to the left side of the image are heard before pixels closer to the right side of the picture letting blind people determine shapes, colours and the position of items. The research has been reported in Cell Press . journal Current Biology. 'The . idea is to replace information from a missing sense by using input from . a different sense,' explained Professor Amedi. 'It's just like bats and dolphins use sounds and echolocation . to 'see' using their ears.' 'Imagine . for instance a diagonal line going down from left to right; if we use a . descending musical scale -going on the piano from right to left - it will . describe it nicely,"" continued Professor Amedi's colleage Ella Striem-Amit.

'What kind of tyrant punishes everyone just to get back at the few he's mad at? I mean, besides Chris Christie,' he added. Maher then proceeded to talk about director Darren Aronofsky's film version of Noah starring Russell Crowe. 'Hey, God, you know you're kind of a dick when you're in a movie with Russell Crowe and you're the one with anger issues,' quipped Maher. Maher likened God's behavior in Noah to Chris Christie's behavior because they both 'punish everyone to get back at the few their mad at' He did however jokingly laud the movie for managing to offend Christians for 'not making the story biblically accurate enough' and offending the Jews because 'the studio will lose money.' He then went on to say that the real problem with conservatives and religious zealots are the voluntary restrictions they place on themselves, reports the Huffington Post. 'I'm reminded as we've just started Lent, that conservatives are always complaining about too much restraining regulation and how they love freedom, but they're the religious ones who voluntarily invent restrictions for themselves,' he said. 'On a hot summer day, Orthodox Jews wear black wool, on a cold winter night Mormons can't drink a hot chocolate... isn't life hard enough without making shit up out of thin air to f*** with yourself?'

'Putin has miscalculated by playing a game of Russian roulette with the international community, but we refuse to blink and will never accept this violation of international law,' said Sen. Bob Menendez, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. In the 14-3 vote, all committee Democrats supported the measure. Some Republican expressed concerns about how the U.S. would pay for the loan guarantees and about provisions to expand the lending authority of the International Monetary Fund. The bill stops short of going after Russian banks or energy companies as some legislators proposed, but it would give Secretary of State John Kerry more leeway as he readies for diplomatic talks with his Russian counterpart in Europe on Friday. Russian President Vladimir Putin was at the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Games where he addressed delagates . Obama urged Congress to move quickly to finalize the loan guarantees, which are supposed to supplement $15 billion in assistance from the European Union, as well as additional money from the International Monetary Fund. The money pledged thus far is less than Ukraine says it will need in order to recover from its recent political upheaval. The country's pro-Russian President, Viktor Yanukovych, fled Kiev for Russia in late February amid growing protests over his decision to scrap an agreement to boost ties with Europe. Shortly after Yanukovych left, Russia began moving military forces into Crimea, a strategically important peninsula where 60 percent of the population is ethnic Russian. Yatsenyuk is serving as head of Ukraine's government in the lead-up to national elections in May. During his meeting with Obama Wednesday, he said Russia must recognize that Ukraine will not sever its ties with the U.S. and Europe. 'Ukraine is and will be part of the Western world,' he said. Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Yatsenyuk cast Putin's move into Crimea as part of a broader plan to reassert Russian influence in Ukraine. 'The idea is not just to annex Crimea, but to invade central Ukraine, Ukrainian capital and to start a war,' said Yatsenyuk, who plans to address the United Nations on Thursday. Putin has so far rebuffed efforts by the U.S. to punish Russia for its military maneuvers in Ukraine. The U.S. has put in place travel bans for Russian and Ukrainian officials involved in the Crimea advances. And the seven other member nations of the Group of Eight have suspended plans to attend their annual summit which was scheduled to be held in Russia this summer.","Fighting broke out at rallies staged by opposing demonstrators.

The Pope has cancelled a photo opportunity with Noah star Russell Crowe over fears the meeting would be leaked to the press. Pope Francis was due to meet with the Hollywood actor and the entire creative team behind the biblical movie to give his blessing for the film. Paramount vice chair Rob Moore, director Darren Aronofsky . and Mr Crowe were all supposed to be in attendance - with film executives hoping it would provide the perfect photo opportunity prior to the film's US release at the end of March. The Pope has cancelled a photo opportunity with Russell Crowe and the creative team behind Noah . Speaking last week, Mr Aronofsky confirmed to Variety the meeting had been proposed - but warned it wouldn’t happen if . anybody reported or tweeted about it ahead of time. The group were penciled in to meet with Pope Francis in Rome on Wednesday morning at around 8am, the website reported. But it would appear the director's fears came true - with the Vatican cancelling the arrangement over  fears word of the gathering would be leaked. Rather amusingly, the Pope's cancellation came a little too late - as Crowe and Aronofsky had already arrived in the Italian city, the website suggests. Russell Crowe takes the lead in the new film based on the tale of Noah from The Book of Genesis . Noah is thought to cost in the region of £75million and is due for release in America on 29th March. Mr Aronofsky's film, based around the story of Noah’s Ark from The Book Of Genesis, has already gained a fair amount of criticism. Agnostic US TV host Bill Maher slammed the movie for a perceived lack of ‘plausibility.’ 'But the thing that’s really disturbing about Noah isn’t the silly, it’s that it’s immoral,’ he said. It’s about a psychotic mass murderer who gets away with it, and his name is God.' Noah is also thought to be banned in several countries for depicting religious characters, with censorship boards in Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates informing distributor Paramount that they won’t be releasing the film. The actor takes his seat during a press conference ahead of the film's US release at the end of the month. The epic has been banned in several countries for depicting religious characters . Crowe, 49, appeared at the Russian capital’s Lotte Hotel for . promotional commitments for the epic - in which he takes the . titular lead. Speaking of his latest role, the actor recently claimed his depiction of Noah will go against the grain of common belief regarding his character. He said: ‘The funny thing with people, they consider Noah to be a benevolent figure because he looked after the animals: ""Awww, Noah. Noah and the animals."" 'It's like, are you kidding me.This is the dude that stood by and watched the entire population of the planet perish. ‘He's not benevolent. He's not even nice. 'At one point in the story his son says, ""I thought you were chosen because you were good?"" And he goes, ""I was chosen because I can get the job done, mate.’""'","Vatican is thought to have cancelled photo opportunity with Russell Crowe .

The skulls and leg bones of over 3,000 victims are meticulously arranged over the ceilings and walls, while over 21,000 additional remains are hidden behind a trap door in a crypt below the church. The interior reveals a repetitive design of human bones laid out a thousand times as ‘a celebration of oneness’, according to design news site Beautiful Decay.

A campaign to save a pit bull that viciously attacked a four-year-old Arizona boy now has almost 45,000 signatures from supporters around the world who don't want the dog to be put down. The fate of Mickey, a five-year-old pit bull terrier, was supposed to be decided on March 4, but a restraining order against his euthanasia was extended until a decision can be made about his fate. Mickey was chained in his own South Phoenix backyard when four-year-old Kevin Vicente reached for a bone lying nearby and was attacked by Mickey. His facial injuries were severe and he faces multiple surgeries and permanent scarring. Surrendered: Mickey is being cared for by animal control until his fate is decided in late March . Permanently scarred: Little Kevin Vicente has undergone multiple surgeries and faces more after the attack left him disfigured . AZ Central reports that Kevin Vicente's injuries were so bad that hospital workers were traumatized after seeing them. He eats and breaths through tubes . According to My Fox Phoenix, Kevin Vicente was at the home of the dog's owner with his babysitter. Supporters of Mickey say the boy shouldn't have been in the yard with the dog, and that Mickey was behaving instinctively because he believed the child was taking away his food. On the contrary, a witness, Guadalupe Villa, says the dog attacked the boy not in warning but to inflict damage. Petition: The Change.org petition now has almost 45,000 signatures, while a Facebook page in support of Kevin Vicente has barely 500 . Backyard mauling: The attack happened in the yard of this South Phoenix home . Supporters: Protesters against putting Mickey down turned out in support of the dog . 'Mickey wasn't just biting to bite, he was shaking his head, trying to hurt,' Villa told My Fox Phoenix. Villa . said the dog belonged to her boyfriend and that she has known Mickey . since he was a puppy. Six months ago, she says, Mickey attacked and . killed a puppy that wandered into the yard. 'Honestly, I just want him to be put down,' she says. 'Crazy how [the campaign to save Mickey] elevated in last two weeks.. people around the world are trying to save him. They don't know the dog.' Villa filed the vicious dog petition with the city, and her boyfriend surrendered the dog to animal control. Nightmares: A witness says the dog grabbed Kevin Vicente's face and would not let go. The boy now suffers nightmares . Mickey has retained a crack team of lawyers who volunteered to represent him at a superior court hearing. 'The dog has no voice at this time.  The owner didn't want to be the voice of the dog.  They surrendered it to animal control, so we're stepping in to defend Mickey,' John Schill of the Schill Law Group told My Fox Phoenix. While a Facebook page dedicated to Mickey has in excess of 40,000 likes, a Facebook page for the support of Kevin Vicente has barely 500. A fundraising website to help Kevin's mother pay for his medical expenses has so far raised just over $6,000. Flor Medrano, a family friend, said Kevin’s mother, a single parent, had to quit her job to take care of her son full time. With no other family in the U.S., Medrano said, the mother needs support, but people are more interested in a dog than a little boy. 'We feel sad because they care more about Mickey,' Medrano told AZ Central. 'They’re saying that it was Kevin’s fault because he was spoiled, and they don’t even know Kevin. And they don’t even know the dog, either.' A hearing is set for March 25.","Signatures on a petition aimed at saving the life of a pit bull that mauled a four-year-old boy have exceeded 44,000 .

Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, the deeply private heiress caught up in the spectacular downfall of former Senator John Edwards' political career, has died at 103. Her longtime personal attorney Alexander Forger said from his office in New York City that Mellon died of natural causes Monday at her 4,000-acre horse farm in Upperville, Virginia. Mellon was long a part of the political scene dating back to the Kennedy White House, but was thrust into the public spotlight as a major donor of the now-disgraced Edwards' failed 2008 presidential bid. Death of an icon: Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon (left), pictured in 1964 with husband Paul Mellon  and stepdaughter Eliza Lloyd, has died at 103-years-old . She was thrust into it the American consciousness after almost a century avoiding it when Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards was indicted in 2011 for using what prosecutors alleged was campaign money, including $750,000 from Mellon, to hide mistress Rielle Hunter and their child during his 2008 campaign. Edwards staffers took to calling her large gifts 'Bunny Money,' and was intended for the Senator's personal use, her lawyer said during a 2011 inquiry into his possible misappropriation of donations, according to the Wall Street Journal. The attorney said Mellon was unaware where the money was funneled, she was never charged with any wrongdoing. She stuck by her man despite the controversy, telling Newsweek in a 2011 interview, calling him a 'great friend' and saying 'he would have been a great president.' A 'great friend': Mellon stuck by former North Carolina Senator John Edwards (left) despite him using money she donated to his failed 2008 presidential campaign to coverup a love child father with Rielle Hunter (right) Her name also found its way onto front pages after former investment adviser Kenneth Starr was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for defrauding clients. Both she and her late husband recommended the con artist to friends, and she expressed regret at being part of their losses, friends told Newsweek. Mellon's wealth first came from Listerine, her grandfather Jordan Lambert invented it. She inherited the fortune long before marrying industrialist-turned-banker Paul Mellon, who inherited his fortune from father Andrew Mellon. One of the wealthiest couples in America at the time of their 1948 marriage, they delved into a life of philanthropy, supporting the arts and other causes. Their wealth brought them famous company including Queen Elizabeth II and husband Prince Phillip, as well as several American politicians including soon-to-be President John F Kennedy and wife Jacqueline Kennedy. Bunny was invited to the White House soon . after JFK won the 1960 election - the new first lady leaned on her for . the tips on interior design and entertaining that became a hallmark of . the Kennedy White House. The last known photograph: A then-90-year-old 'Bunny' Mellon speaking during a January, 2000, open house for the Piedmont Child Care Center, a non-profit child care cente . Bunny and Jackie were such close friends that Mellon chartered the private jet that flew the two women to Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral after his 1968 assassination. Mellon was also tipped to redesign Rose Garden into the space it is today after decades of neglect, according to the Journal. Her familiarity also led to her being the floral director for JFK's funeral a few years later. All of this came at the cost of husband Paul Mellon having what Newsweek, citing a Washington Post report, called 'a wandering eye.' He carried on multiple affairs during their marriage, to the point she even invited one of his mistresses on a family vacation, according to the Post. In the end, though, she found herself blind and alone with her Virginia horse farm and a team of servants. 'Itâ€™s hard being 100 and blind, she told Newsweek. 'I donâ€™t mind being 100, I can cope with that, but not seeing is very scary.'","Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon died at her Virginia horse farm .

A mother has shown incredible forgiveness after asking police not to press charges against a 15-year-old boy who allegedly killed her son while joyriding. Mason Merrill, 22, died when a pickup truck reportedly being driven by the teenager smashed into his scooter in Mesa, Arizona. He was given CPR by a police officer and taken to hospital, but later succumbed to his injuries. Forgiving: Carrie Merrill has asked police not to charge a 15 year old boy who allegedly killed her son . Now, his mother, Carrie Merrill, has said she has forgiven the boy who allegedly killed him - adding that her Mormon son had 'lived more life than most people do in a lifetime'. 'You know, life is dangerous and I am not angry at this boy,' she told CBS Atlanta. 'I would hate . to be in his shoes and I feel so much for his family. This tragedy has . really taken more than one life.' Victim: Mason Merrill, 22, was driving a scooter when a pickup truck reportedly being driven by the teenager smashed into him in Mesa, Arizona . The mother of six added that she had asked police not to pursue charges against the underage driver, who is believed to have been accompanied by three other teenagers in the truck, including his 14-year-old sister. 'He has got his whole life ahead of him. Why do I want to take that away from him? I don't want to,' she said. Mr Merrill, a talented musician who recently served on a mission trip to Mexico for his church, was knocked off his scooter when the blue 'lifted' truck turned in front of him on University Drive, near Alma School Road, according to witnesses. The teenage driver, who only had a learner's driving permit, is believed to have climbed out of the vehicle and run over to the victim, before driving away. A nearby Mesa police officer arrived at the scene at 2.25pm and alerted the emergency services, before performing CPR on Mr Merrill in a bid to keep him alive, according to a police spokesman. Mrs Merrill, who first heard of the incident on television but did not think it would involve one of her children, said she had driven to the crash site following inquiries from family and friends. She said she 'knew' the victim was her son as she spotted his scooter lying in the road. Following the incident on Wednesday, police used witness descriptions to track down the truck to a house in the area of Alma School and Broadway. The teenage driver and his sister were arrested and taken into custody, before later being released to their parents. Scene: The incident happened on University Drive, near Alma School Road, at around 2.25pm on Wednesday .

A section of the Great Wall of China has been set aside for graffiti in a bid to save other parts being vandalised by tourists. Authorities chose a popular stretch of the ancient monument where visitors can scrawl their names in the hope it will stop the spread of graffiti. Most of the graffiti is written in English, with phrases like 'I was 'ere' and notices saying who to call 'for a good time' common. Scroll down for video . A part of the Mutianyu section (pictured here) of the Great Wall of China has been chosen as a spot for tourists to scrawl graffiti . A spot on the Mutianyu section in Huairou County, about 43 miles north-east of Beijing, was chosen. It is one of the most popular tourist spots along the wall. The graffiti section will be set up at one of the fighting towers that . has become a common place there for tourists to scrawl on the walls. It attracts millions of tourists per year, 40 per cent of whom are estimated to be foreigners, which explains why most of the graffiti is in English. Graffiti has long been a problem with Chinese scenic sites, and has sparked innovative responses from authorities. Officials in Wuhan set up touch-screen graffiti platforms to keep visitors from carving their initials into a local pagoda. The . minders of the Great Wall are reportedly also considering 'an . electronic graffiti board,' to hopefully cut down on permanent . desecration of the site. I was 'ere: Former U.S. President Clinton visited the section with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea in June 1998 . The original Great Wall dates back to seventh century China, but the section in Zhangjiakou was rebuilt more than 500 years ago in 1484 during the Ming Dynasty. The wall has been constantly rebuilt and repaired throughout history. An expert said: 'Like any building project, some work lasts longer than others.' Still one of the only man made objects visible from space, the wall is made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. Chinese authorities have been trying to find new ways to tackle the problem of graffiti on the Great Wall of China. Pictured here is the Mutianyu near Beijing . Sections . of the Wall north of Beijing and near tourist centres, such as Mutianyu, have been . preserved and even extensively renovated but in many locations the Wall . is in disrepair. In . poorer parts of the country the Wall is sometimes used as a village . playground or is used as a source of stones for rebuilding houses and . roads. Sections have also been affected by graffiti and vandalism. Other parts have been destroyed to make way for construction. More than 37 miles in the Gansu province may disappear in the next two decades, due to erosion from sandstorms. In parts, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 16ft to less than six feet. The iconic square-shaped lookout towers that form the most famous images of the wall have disappeared completely. Many . western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than . brick and stone, and are therefore more susceptible to erosion. It was built along an east-to-west . line across the historical northern borders of China in part to protect . the Chinese Empire against attack by various nomadic groups or military . incursions by various warlike peoples or forces. In . addition to acting as a shield against border enemies the Great Wall . was also used to enforce duties on goods transported along the Silk . Road, to regulate or encourage trade and control immigration and . emigration. Troop . barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through smoke or . fire also helped to enhance the walls defensive characteristics. The . Wall goes from Shanhaiguan in the east, to Lop Lake in the west, an . area that loosely represents the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. The . entire length, which includes trenches and natural barriers such as . hills and rivers, stretches to 5,500 miles. Although other experts have concluded that if branches of the wall are included its entire length is around 14,000 miles. The . first wall construction is thought to date from the 7th century BC. Especially famous is the wall built between 220–206 BC by the first . Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. Little . of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been . rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall was . reconstructed during the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century.","Authorities have been fighting a constant battle against graffiti .

Alleged harassment: Ann Cardenas, 29, has accused Sgt. David John of sexually abusing and harassing her at the 83rd Precinct in Bushwick, Brooklyn, pictured . The Brooklyn district attorney's office and the NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau are also investigating the claims, which Cardenas' lawyer describes as the worst sexual harassment case she's seen. 'There was a frathouse culture in the precinct that was beyond the pale,' Linda Cronin told the New York Daily News. The six-year force veteran describes an occasion in the summer of 2013 when she was sitting on a couch in the precinct and Sgt. John 'grabbed me, threw me down and held me down while trying to kiss me.' The January EEOC complaint continues, 'He then climbed on top of me and would not let me up.' The harassment allegedly went on for more than a year. 'He also showed me pictures of his penis and asked, ""Is this big? It's bigger than your boyfriend's.""' In the complaint she alleged the harassment regularly took place in front of other officers. 'Sgt. John often pulls his pants down in front of me,' she claims. 'He often sleeps in the office with his belt undone, and then will pull his pants down, grab his groin and say, ""Ann, hold this for me.""' John's representatives have denied Cardenas' claims, suggesting there are many holes in her story. Andrew Quinn, a lawyer for the Sergeants Benevolent Association, told the Daily News: 'Sgt. John is aware of the allegations and is in possession of compelling evidence confirming that Officer Cardenas is not being entirely truthful.' The 20-year NYPD veteran has filed for retirement but his departure is on hold during the investigation. He was placed on modified assignment last month.","NYPD officer Ann Cardenas, 29, has accused Sgt. David John of sexually abusing and harassing her at the 83rd Precinct in Bushwick, Brooklyn .

The first new garden city for 100 years will be constructed in an attempt to boost housebuilding, it has been revealed. Chancellor George Osborne said the measure will be in his Budget this week, arguing Britain needed to ‘get building’ in order to secure the economic recovery.

As it is now: The new garden city will be built at Ebbsfleet in Kent, which will initially provide 15,000 homes . It will be modelled on popular garden cities built at the beginning of the last century, including Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. The Government is to set up an urban development corporation, involving both private and public companies, to help build the new city, and offer £200million in public investment. In addition, the controversial Government-backed Help to Buy scheme is to be extended until the end of the decade. The idea of a new city in Ebbsfleet, which has a Eurostar train station, has been mooted for years but progress has been slow. To date, only 150 new homes have been built. ‘At Ebbsfleet there is the land available, there is fantastic infrastructure with a high speed line, it’s on the river, it’s in the South East of England where a lot of the housing pressure has been,’ the Chancellor said.

That is one of the messages of my Budget. ‘Britain has to up its ambition, Britain has to up its game, Britain has to earn its way in the world. Yes, the economy is recovering but that is not enough. We have got to finish the job.’ But Emma Reynolds MP, Labour’s shadow housing minister, said: ‘The Government has had four years to make progress on garden cities but instead of getting on and building them, ministers have spent their time making empty announcements and suppressing reports. ‘We will wait to see the detail in the Budget, but people will want to know how (yesterday’s) announcement to build 15,000 homes in Ebbsfleet differs from the announcement to build 20,000 homes in the same place in 2012.

The parents of a Japanese girl who was abducted by the North Koreans at the age of 13 today spoke of their agony over not knowing her fate 36 years on. For two decades after Megumi Yokota vanished on her way home to school, the police would call her parents whenever they found an unidentified body. It later emerged that she was one of a dozen Japanese citizens kidnapped by the secretive North Korean regime in order to help teach spies about Japan. Scroll down for video . Gone: Megumi Yokota disappeared from her hometown in Japan in 1977 at the age of 13 . Family: Megumi, centre, with her parents Shigeru and Sakie, and younger brother Tetsuya and Takuya . North Korea insists that Megumi is now dead - but her body has never been recovered, and her parents still hold out hope that she may be alive and will return home one day. The schoolgirl from Niigata disappeared while walking home after playing badminton at school in 1977. 'We felt a huge fear,' her mother Sakie told a UN panel today. 'I took her little brothers by the hand and we ran out in the dark, looking on beaches and calling Megumi, Megumi.' Police sniffer dogs found that Megumi had reached a street corner near her home, but the trail went cold there. Agony: Mr and Mrs Yokota discovered 25 years later that their daughter had been kidnapped by North Korea . Testimony: The couple today gave evidence to a UN Commission of Inquiry into North Korea's kidnapping . Intervention: Figures such as George W. Bush, pictured with Sakie and Takuya, have tried to persuade the North Korean regime to reveal the fate of the 13 Japanese citizens it kidnapped . 'Whenever they found a body, or there was a murder, or a skeleton got snagged in the fishing net of a boat, anywhere in Japan, the police would get in touch with us,' Mrs Yokota said. 'We lived in a sadness that I thought would drive us mad.' In 1997, reports began to emerge suggesting that a number of missing Japanese people had ended up in North Korea. Five years later, Kim Jong Il admitted that 13 people had been kidnapped from Japan in the 1970s and 1980s in order to help efforts to spy on the country. The regime claimed that eight of them - including Megumi - were dead, but did not provide proof. It emerged that Megumi had married and had a child while in North Korea, but her subsequent fate was unclear. Alive: Megumi is pictured in North Korea as a young adult; the authorities claim that she has since died . Mystery: The Yokota family is fighting to find out Megumi's fate, and they say they are confident she will return . Pyongyang sent Japan some remains which they claimed were those of Megumi, but DNA tests found that they were in fact a man's. 'Three photos came back with the bones, our first sight of Megumi as an adult,' Mrs Yokota said. 'I cried and cried. Both my husband and I apologised for not being able to help her.' She told the UN Commission of Inquiry that her daughter would turn 49 in October. 'She was just 13 years old,' she added. 'Did they mistake her for an adult and take her, or did they have something else in mind? We'll never know. Until she comes home.' The UN hearing in Tokyo is the first time an expert panel has ever formally examined North Korea's human rights record. The dispute over the abductees has been one of the most controversial obstacles to establishing good relations between Japan and Pyongyang. Husband: Megumi married Kim Young-nam, second right, and the pair had a daughter, Kim Hye-kyong, right; Mr Kim's second wife and their son are also pictured . Home: Megumi was kidnapped from the Japanese coast in Niigata prefecture . Prime minister Shinzo Abe has expressed hope that North Korea's young president Kim Jong Un will be more open to co-operation than his father, but the North has refused to recognise the UN commission. Panel chair Michael Kirby, a retired Australian judge, said that the inquiry aimed to give a voice to the Yokotas and other affected families, and to help them know what happened to their relatives. 'Who else has engaged in kidnapping, and not kidnapping of nuclear scientists, internet experts - the kidnapping of a chef, a guard, a schoolchild, a housewife whose two young children were left crying in a creche?' he said. 'It certainly calls out for evidentiary answers. If the evidentiary answers are not given, North Korea will only have itself to blame if the commission of inquiry and the world community believes what these witnesses have told.'","Megumi Yokota went missing aged 13 on way home from school in 1977 .
