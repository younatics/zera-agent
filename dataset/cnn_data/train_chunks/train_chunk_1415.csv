"These are the shocking images of a knife-wielding raider attempting to stab a convenience store worker during a terrifying robbery. The man entered the shop on Balham High Road at 1.45am on Wednesday February 18 before threatening the lone staff member. The attacker jabbed his ten-inch knife at the man several times, forcing his 27-year-old victim to open the till.

The man entered the shop on Balham High Road at 1.45am on Wednesday February 18 and threatened the lone staff member . He waved the weapon towards the shopkeeper's face, demanding he open the till (left and right) The Metropolitan Police confirmed the victim suffered an injury to his right hand before opening the till.

"A bank today unveiled plans to enable people to pay each other and small businesses using just their Twitter handle in what it says will be a UK banking first. Launching on both Android phones and iOS devices on March 10, people using Barclays’s Pingit payment service will be able to link their Twitter handle to the service. Pingit, which was launched in 2012, already allows people to send and receive payments using mobile phone numbers, without needing to exchange bank account numbers and sort codes. People using the Barclays Pingit payment service will be able to link their Twitter handle to the service . Pingit is open to people who do not bank with Barclays, as well as those who are its customers. The expansion of the service will also be open to non-Barclays customers, meaning that it can potentially be used by the 13.5 million people in the UK who use Twitter. To date, Pingit has received 3.7 million downloads and more than £1 billion has been sent using it. This new way of payment will also be available to businesses, potentially helping the 57,000 companies in the UK currently signed up to Pingit. Barclays said that 80 per cent of UK Twitter users now access the social network through their mobile regularly. To sign up, users will be able to link their Twitter handle to their Pingit profile under the app settings. Transfers: The maximum daily amount that a person can send to another person via Pingit is £1,500 . In order to use the new service, both the payee and the person paying need to be signed up to both Twitter and the Barclays Pingit app. The maximum daily amount that a person can send to another person via Pingit is £1,500. Darren Foulds, director of Barclays mobile banking and Pingit, said: ‘Adding the ability to pay people or a small business using just a Twitter handle brings together a social and digital experience to create a new step forward for mobile payments in the UK.’ Pingit was launched three years ago and lets people send and receive payments with mobile phone numbers. They do not need sort codes or bank account numbers. It was the first mobile payments app in the UK, and its top three uses are for splitting food bills (26 per cent), paying friends (26 per cent) and paying rent (14 per cent). The oldest user is  aged 104, while the youngest is 16. Some 13 per cent of downloads are by non-Barclays customers. So far there have been 3.7million downloads and more than £1billion has been sent on it. And shoppers who spot goods in a window display can scan a quick response (QR) code using the app to see the price, delivery details and stock - as well as get the option to buy the item with one click. Barclays says all Pingit customers are protected by a guarantee that will 'refund any money that is taken from your account if you’re an innocent victim of fraud'. One internet security expert said the Twitter handles of customers exchanging money are most likely intended to act as ‘identifiers’ - rather than bank details being linked to a Twitter account. David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, told MailOnline: ‘The idea behind it is convenience for one thing, but the other thing is security. ‘If I want to pay you £20 or £50 and have your mobile number then I can use Pingit to do that. Pingit have your bank details and my bank details, but they don't share that. Neither party needs the other's information. ‘That is the thinking behind it - a nice, convenient way of doing that I'm not totally sure what the mechanism of linking is. I rather suspect that like the phone number they're just using it is an as an identifier.’ Asked if he felt the system was safe for customers, Mr Emm said: ‘If all we're talking about here is that an identifier then I don't see why not. ‘I’m using the Twitter handle as a hanger on which I'm paying the money to you. I can’t see there is any additional risk.’ He added: ‘If we're talking about a mechanism that is linking my bank account details to my Twitter settings, then it's something else, but I don't think we're talking about that. ‘More and more people are using Twitter and it's second nature. Everyone has a phone number, but for many people, especially young people, Twitter is a more ready-to-hand identifier.’ Technology has transformed the way that people pay in recent years. Spending on contactless ‘tap and go’ cards more than trebled over the last year to reach a record £2.32 billion in 2014, according to figures recently released by the UK Cards Association. Paym, a cross-industry mobile payments scheme which enables people to send payments as easily as texting, recently said that nearly two million people have now signed up to the initiative, which launched last April. Wearable payments technology is also being developed. Last year, Barclaycard unveiled its bPay wristband, which allows people to pay with a wave of the wrist. It has also been trialling pairs of contactless payment gloves, which people can use by touching the back of their hand on the reader at the till, in a similar way to making contactless card payments.","'UK banking first' will launch on Android and iOS devices on March 10 .

"A jilted groom who passed out at his wedding only to  find his fiancee married to another when he came round two hours later has accused her of feeding him sweets laced with sedatives. Jugal Kishore, 25, from Uttar Predesh province, India, claims bride Indiravati, 23, drugged him in order to marry her secret sweetheart and humiliate his family. Mr Kishore says he was given a traditional sweet made of betel leaves when he arrived at the ceremony ten days ago, after which he started feeling woozy. Jugal Kishore (left), 25, was left devastated when his wife-to-be wife Indiravati, 23, (right) married a guest . He said: 'I'd not eaten all day either, so I felt uneasy on my feet and I just hit the floor.' Having just made the 370-mile journey from his village to the celebration he was immediately rushed off to hospital. When he  regained consciousness two hours later he went back to the wedding venue to continue the rituals, but Indiravati was married to Harpal Singh, a member of her brother-in-law's family. Mr Singh claimed he was caught off guard as he was only wearing jeans and a leather jacket at the time, but agreed to go ahead with the wedding anyway. Mr Kishore added: 'I was helpless. The wedding was already over and she was no more mine. 'I had to return home without my wife. I can never forgive her for this embarrassment.' His elder brother Ravi Kumar, 34, believes the whole wedding was a farce and it was a conspiracy to insult the family. He said: 'My brother is perfectly healthy. He's never suffered any seizures. In fact the doctor said he was anxious and had a high blood pressure and that's why he lost consciousness. 'He sent him home with no concerns and told him to eat some food. It's shocking that no one from the bride's family joined us at the hospital. They seemed totally unfazed.' Mr Kishore claims Indiravati's relatives became aggressive when he went back to the wedding venue. He said: 'After I returned from the hospital, a crowd of nearly 250 people surrounded my family. They threatened us and told us to pay Rs 50,000 (£520) for the wedding. Indiravati (left) was angry she had not been informed of her husband's 'condition' and asked Harpal Singh, a member of her brother-in-law's family, to marry her instead. Mr Kishore (right) says he's embarrassed . 'My family pleaded with them to be reasonable but they did not budge.' However, Indiravati's family say Mr Singh had an epileptic seizure at the altar, and angry that they had not been informed of his health issues, they married her off to someone else instead. Indiravati's younger brother Suraj, 18, has also accused Mr Kishore of being drunk and said his sister called off the wedding because she didn't want to 'marry an alcoholic'. 'We never said he'd suffered an epileptic seizure and we did not give him any sweets laced with sedatives,' her brother said. 'These stories are getting out of control.' 'The wedding was going well and everything was fine until the wedding garlands were exchanged and then he started throwing up. He was shivering and was not in his senses. 'This is when my sister and family decided to call off the wedding as we were confident that he was an alcoholic and perhaps a sick man. 'We didn't go to the hospital with him because we were very angry with them for hiding his drinking habit. 'My sister confirmed she no longer wanted to marry Jugal, so the whole family stood by her decision. 'My sister did know her now husband but they were never friends before hand. 'Harpal is my brother-in-law's younger brother and is a wonderful man. When my sister asked him if he would marry her, he said yes immediately. He is a gem of a person.' Mr Kishore added: 'I cannot believe she has spread these rumours about me having a seizure to marry an old friend. 'I am finding it really hard to comprehend how a young guy would quickly agree to a wedding? I am certain they already knew each other and it was all planned.' 'I don't have a history of seizures. I don't suffer with epilepsy. 'I have no idea where they've got that information from, it's ridiculous and totally untrue. They're just making up stories and protecting themselves.' Mr Kishore and his relatives filed a report with police, but eventually withdrew the case after elders intervened and begged them to reconsider. Police Chief Ram Khiladi Solanki said: 'Ravi Kumar came to us with a complaint but before we could intervene the bride's family arrived at the station and compromised the matter. 'Both families have amicably resolved the situation and the complaints have now been withdrawn.' The jilted groom added: 'We thought it is better to move on. Now that she is married there's not much I can do about it anyway. 'But I cannot forgive her ever for what she has done to me. It's been very embarrassing.'","Jugal Kishore, 25, collapsed before exchanging vows with his wife-to-be .

"A teenager  has told of the horrifying moment he witnessed his best friend being mauled by a five metre shark - and only survived when he fired his spear-gun into the beast's mouth. Matt Pullella went spearfishing with Jay Muscat at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast, about 70km east of Albany, in December last year when they were attacked from behind by the Great White. Matt saw how the shark fatally bit his friend's leg and seconds later came after him. It was thanks to his quick thinking that Matt was able to save himself from the same fate as his friend, by firing his spear gun into the mouth of the shark which he believed was coming back to attack him. Scroll down for video . Jay Muscat (left and right) was spearfishing with his friend Matt Pullella when they were attacked by a shark . Matt escaped injury as he fired his spear-gun down the shark's throat . The shark first attacked Jay then went after Matt seconds later . In an interview with Nine Network's A Current Affair on Wednesday night, Matt says he was feeling a little 'on edge' just before he went diving with Jay. 'Usually you're relaxed before a dive but I wasn't relaxed at all,' he said. But after being comforted by Jay, the pair dove into Cheyne Beach together - a usual diving spot for the two best friends. As they went deeper into the waters Matt felt a huge force coming from behind. The two 17-year-olds were unexpectedly attacked from behind by the shark.

'There was a lot of blood and then I saw this shark hanging off Jay.' Matt tried to swim away but through the sea of blood, he could see 'rows and rows of big white teeth'. 'I looked back and coming through the blood was this set of jaws... swimming straight at me,' he said. 'It was in a space of 10 seconds that everything people told me came flashing through my head.' Matt recalled thinking that he had to shoot the shark in the nose as he was told 'it was the most sensitive part of the shark'. 'But it didn't give me that option so I just pointed my gun and straight up its mouth,' he said. 'So I just shot the gun straight down its throat, into its guts.' It was then Matt's chance to escape, swimming 30 metres back to shore and knowing deep down that his friend may not survive. Jay died from the a severed artery in his leg and despite the terrifying ordeal, Matt is determined to get back into the water. 'There is a bit of madness to it but you can't stop something you love,' he said.","Jay Muscat and friend Matt Pullella were spearfishing when they were attacked by a shark .

Surprisingly Robert is the first person to admit that he is not perfect despite having pooled so much money into his looks. 'I always find something to criticise about my looks. 'I think the proof of that is the fact that I have had over 40 surgical procedures in the search for perfection.' Despite having so much work done Robert says he is still not entirely happy with the way he looks . The Czech model says that he often get's compared to a Ken doll which oddly people find appealing .

"While the construction industry has traditionally been thought of as a 'man's world', two women have launched a range of female workwear to encourage young girls to feel confident considering a future in the workforce. Carpenter Laura Madden and apprentice Juanita Mottram launched their Brisbane-based company eve Renovations in 2010 out of a passion to shake up the construction industry- where only 1% are women- with a solely female workforce. 'Laura has been a builder in the industry for 15 years, and she can say without a doubt that the change in that time has been marginal. For us nothing changed because, really, nothing has changed,' Juanita told Daily Mail Australia. Carpenter Laura Madden (left) and apprentice Juanita Mottram (right) launched their own clothing range . In the 25 years between 1987 and 2012, the proportion of women represented in the industry has remained the same, a statistic which both worried and motivated the pair to go a step further with their business. The women launched eve Workwear, a range of clothing suitable for women in the industry that was made specifically for them to work in, while still looking good. 'Our company does domestic and commercial renovations and we obviously wanted to look good when we went to clients houses for quotes,' Juanita said. 'I come from a marketing background and meetings were big deal, you wanted to look the part, so I couldn't understand why it was acceptable to turn up in daggy clothes that didn't fit,' she said. 'Women's workwear was just men's workwear with a different label on it. They didn't fit right, were too big, and were in horrible colours.' So Laura and Juanita decided to do something about their situation and have workwear specifically made for them, and after having praise heaped upon their designs, made up their minds to extend the trend to other women. The range is suitable for women in the industry and is made specifically for them to work in, while looking good . The self-funded workwear range launched in 2011, releasing small-scale ranges which have now expanded after two long years of hard work . The range bridges the gap between workwear and streetwear . The self-funded workwear range launched in 2011, releasing small-scale ranges which have now expanded after two long years of hard work. The range bridges the gap between workwear and streetwear, offering shirts, pants, jackets, singlets and hi-vis necessities that fit well and are still practical. 'In any job that a woman decides to do, dressing and feeling confident and proud of what you're doing is so important,' said Juanita. 'A lot of study goes into being a carpenter or electrician and women should be proud of that,' she said. Juanita said that having clothing that fits well and is specifically designed for women also adds a sense of belonging in a male-dominated industry. 'We've had some great responses and stories from women doing all different things, from truck-drivers to make-up artists,' she said. 'We're hoping that with our renovations and clothing company that we get noticed for what we're doing and make the industry more of an option for girls.' The range offers shirts, pants, jackets, singlets and hi-vis necessities that fit well and are still practical . Juanita said that having clothing that fits well and is specifically designed for women also adds a sense of belonging in a male-dominated industry . 'There are so many great options- women can design furniture, or do something technical like become an electrician. There are so many different areas that women may find they're suited to, it's not all heavy lifting.' Both Laura and Juanita have male mentors are very positive about the way they have been treated in the industry, and say that men are a lot more accepting of women on site. However Juanita said that she wants to encourage more women to actually get on the site in the first place, which she believes starts in high schools. 'Both Laura and I have stayed with the tools rather than moving into management or administration roles, because we are trying to show girls in high school that trades are an option,' she said. 'We are trying to create change, and if you don't take risks then nothing will change.' Juanita's favourite item from the eve Workwear range is the brand new workpants . Juanita said that the company also wants to encourage men and women to look at jobs they are interested in . Juanita's favourite item from the eve Workwear range is the brand new work pants. 'They are so versatile, and have stretch in the fabric which makes them super easy to wear. We describe them as chuck them on the floor and chuck them back on. They can just be worn and worn,' she said. 'They were inspired by vintage workwear which comes through in the buckle on the back, and the big pockets which crosses them into streetwear and makes it feminine.' Juanita said that the company also wants to encourage both men and women to look at jobs they are interested in, rather than along gender line. 'Take gender out of the equation. Some guys are good at make-up and some girls are good at being electricians,' she said. 'It shouldn't matter if you're male or female. It should be about the role you want to pursue.'

"It was integral to the counterculture of the 1960’s, but it seems the Kombi bus has now become a symbol of wealth. A restored 1960 Volkswagen Kombi Samba bus sold for a staggering $202,000 on Monday night at a south-east Melbourne collectibles auction. Believed to be one of just three examples delivered to Australia in this configuration, the 23-window Kombi  sparked a wild bidding frenzy at the Shannons Auctions in Cheltenham, nabbing a record price for the vehicle in Australia. Scroll down for video . A 23-window 1960 Volkswagen Kombi Samba, believed one of just three examples delivered to Australia in this configuration . The bus sold for a staggering $202,000 on Monday night at a south-east Melbourne collectibles auction, a record price for the vehicle in Australia . The Kombi, introduced in 1950 by Volkswagon, was nicknamed the 'Hippie Van' in the 1960's due to its popularity in the counterculture movement. Since production of the vehicle was ceased in late 2013 due to environmental legislation, they've become a sought after collectors item among auto-mobile enthusiasts. The auctioned Kombi had undergone some $100,000 of restoration over half a decade. It won several awards at Day Of The Volkswagens competition in November, including presidents choice & best in class. Auction manager Christophe Boribon told Daily Mail Australia the restoration process involved the entire car. The van is now presented in two-tone period colours of Paprika and White with a contrasting tan upholstery .

Between a crowd of 600 on the floor, and several hundred internet and phone bidders, prices quickly rose to $150,000.' A phone bidder eventually took the prize. The Kombi was nicknamed the 'Hippie Van' in the 1960's due to its popularity in the counterculture movement . Mr Boribon said a Kombi revival has been gaining traction over recent years, with enthusiasts of other vehicles 'developing a soft spot' for the vans. The sale comes after a string of lucrative Kombi sales in Australia. Last year, a battered Kombi went under the hammer for $30,000. A restored Kombi was auctioned off for $74,000 in late December.","The Kombi is one of just three examples in Australia of this configuration .

"Daughter of the late Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina, 21, was hospitalized after being found unconscious in a bathtub at home on January 31 . Doctors were unable to take Bobbi Kristina out of her medically-induced coma on Wednesday. The 21-year-old, who is on life support at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, began having seizures when they began taking her off various medications, CNN reports. It was then decided to keep her in the coma. Whitney Houston's daughter remains in a serious condition after being found unconscious in a bathtub at her home on January 31. Last week, she was given a tracheotomy. Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, Bobby Brown, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. The news came amid ruptures between Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, and her father, R&B artist Bobby Brown. On Monday, Gordon went on an extraordinary Twitter rant against Brown - claiming he has hardly seen his 21-year-old daughter in years before she was taken to hospital and was only interested in the family's money. Gordon, who has reportedly been banned from visiting Bobbi Kristina, told Brown to 'grow up' - insisting she will hate him when she wakes up. The angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the Brown family told Gordon he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before Bobbi Kristina was found face down in a bathtub. Gordon also insisted he has taken care of his girlfriend '24/7' since her mother died in 2012. On Monday, he first tweeted: 'Okay, so I'll probably get in trouble for this,' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent Bobby Brown. The first, underneath a picture of the new Bobbi Kristina tattoo on his right arm, read: 'Man to man I love your daughter.' He added: 'I don't know why you won't let me see her. Grow up. Your daughter is going to hate you when she wakes up.' Scroll down for video . Bobby Brown (pictured right earlier this month) said his daughter's boyfriend Nick Gordon (pictured left) has been lying about trying to visit her in the hospital . The 21-year-old  is on life support at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia . The messages were quickly deleted from his profile, however he continued to shame Bobby Brown's parenting skills. He wrote: 'Crazy how all the Browns came to the hospital when this went down. I've been with her 24/7 watching over her and mom. Bobby left when it got heavy. Gordon then claimed: 'Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs.' He added: 'Now him and his family want Whitneys $$$ which belongs to Krissi or Cissy.' His followers quickly got involved in the conversation, some sharing messages of support and others were what he described as 'negative allegations'. 'Listen at the end of all this I took care of Whitney Houston and Kriss which was very hard on someone my age' he wrote. 'They cried on my shoulders!!!!' 'Grow up': Gordon uploaded a screenshot of text messages he allegedly sent to Bobby Brown. In them he insisted Bobbi Kristina will hate her father when she wakes up . Motivation: The 22-year-old claims the Brown family only want the money from Whitney Ho . Parenting: Gordon accused Bobby Brown of virtually deserting his daughter during the rant . Referring to the night she was hospitalized, he said: 'My only regret is not getting to [Bobbi] faster to give CPR.' On Sunday, he posted: 'I can't wait till she wakes up and dismiss all of the negative thoughts. There is a reason why her mom made me promise to look after her.' Bobbi Kristina, the only daughter of the late Whitney Houston has been hospitalized in Atlanta since being found unresponsive on January 31 in a tub at her Georgia home. Police said Gordon was performing CPR when emergency responders arrived at the home. Gordon tweeted in anger on Saturday, saying he had been denied access to visit his 21-year-old girlfriend. 'Let me in the hospital to see my girl and let her hear my voice SHE WILL WAKE UP!!!' he tweeted on Saturday. Hope: Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend is still optimistic that she will wake up from the medically-induced coma she has been in  for the last three weeks . Regrets: Referring to the night she was found face down in a bathtub, he told his followers he wishes he could have done more to save her. Police said they arrived and found him giving CPR . A lawyer for Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown, said in a statement on Sunday that Bobbi Kristina's partner, Nick Gordon, was offered an opportunity to potentially visit her if he agreed to meet certain conditions. 'Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe. At least not desperate enough to inform Bobby Brown, in writing, what happened to Bobbi Kristina,' attorney Christopher Brown told E!. But Gordon's attorneys said R&B singer Brown has consistently denied Gordon permission to visit. They said they advised Gordon not to agree to the conditions set by Brown. The conditions have not been made public. The attorneys said Gordon has repeatedly offered to discuss the issue privately with Brown. According to NBC, Brown's statement said that because Gordon had failed to spell out what happened to Bobbi Kristina, 'there is no reason for any additional discussion with him'. Reports have suggested Gordon may by the subject of a police investigation after police found 'suspicious injuries' on Bobbi Kristina in hospital. Sources have claimed that Bobbi Kristina used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother Whitney Houston three years earlier (mother and daughter pictured together at a Grammys party in 2011) Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized earlier this month, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. A new report which surfaced last week claimed that Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub. In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident, according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed, and still was 'distraught' over her mother's death three years ago. One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words'. Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Gordon reportedly has become the main focus in a criminal investigation by police in Roswell, Georgia. Prior to being hospitalized, Bobbi Kristina had been in a car crash, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said. The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said. One of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out.","Bobbi Kristina was taken off some of her medications Wednesday by doctors hoping to remove her from her medically induced coma .

"A supermassive black hole 12 million times larger than the sun and powering ‘the brightest lighthouse in the distant universe’ has been discovered. The extraordinary object is at the centre of a quasar - an intensely powerful galactic radiation source - with a million billion times the sun’s energy output. The nature of quasars has remained a mystery since they were discovered in 1963. An international team of scientists has discovered a supermassive black hole (shown in the artist's impression above) at the centre of a distant quasar - an intensely powerful galactic radiation source . But scientists theorise that they are generated by matter heating up as it is dragged into supermassive black holes at the centre of distant galaxies. The new object, named SDSS J0100+2802, is 12.8 billion light years from Earth and was formed 900 million years after the Big Bang, which gave birth to the universe. Astronomers cannot explain how such an enormous black hole could have formed so soon after the first stars and galaxies emerged. Dr Fuyan Bian, from the Australian National University, who was involved in the discovery, explained: ‘Forming such a large black hole so quickly is hard to interpret with current theories… . ‘This black hole at the centre of the quasar gained enormous mass in a short period of time.’ The quasar, which is the brightest ever detected in the early universe, was found after astronomers conducted a survey of distant luminous objects using data from several large telescopes around the world. The new object, named SDSS J0100+2802, is 12.8 billion light years from Earth and was formed 900 million years after the Big Bang, which gave birth to the universe. An artist's interpretation of the Big Bang is shown . Nasa's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and ESA's (European Space Agency) XMM-Newton telescope have spotted fierce winds blowing outwards in all directions from a supermassive black hole. The phenomenon had been suspected, but now researchers have proved the winds are powerful enough to inhibit the host galaxy's ability to make new stars. In the new study, astronomers determined PDS 456 - an extremely bright black hole known as a quasar more than 2 billion light-years away - sustains winds that carry more energy every second than is emitted by more than a trillion suns. 'Now we know quasar winds significantly contribute to mass loss in a galaxy, driving out its supply of gas, which is fuel for star formation,' said the study's lead author Emanuele Nardini of Keele University in England. NuSTAR and XMM-Newton simultaneously observed PDS 456 on five separate occasions in 2013 and 2014. It is stands out as a very distant and old object because it had a ‘redshift,’ which is a measurement of the stretching of light to the red end of the spectrum by the expansion of the universe, of 6.30. Only 40 known quasars have a redshift higher than six, which is the yardstick used to define the early universe boundary. SDSS J0100+2802 was formed soon after the end of the ‘epoch of reionisation,’ which created the star-filled universe we know today. It was a transformative era that ended the ‘cosmic dark age’ following the Big Bang. Astronomers have uncovered more than 200,000 quasars dating as far back as 700 million years after the Big Bang. Despite their high luminosity they are extremely faint because of their great distance and difficult to find. Professor Xue-Bing Wu, from Peking University in China, who led the study reported in the journal Nature, said: ‘This quasar is very unique. ‘We are so excited, when we found that there is such a luminous and massive quasar only 0.9 billion years after the Big Bang. ‘Just like the brightest lighthouse in the distant universe, its glowing light will help us to probe more about the early universe.’ US co-author Dr Yuri Beletsky, from the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC, said the quasar will act like a laboratory for scientists to study the way that a quasar’s black hole and host galaxy co-evolve. ‘Our findings indicate that in the early universe, quasar black holes probably grew faster than their host galaxies, although more research is needed to confirm this idea,’ he said.","Supermassive black hole is at the centre of a quasar - a powerful galactic radiation source - with a million billion times the sun’s energy output .

"How safe is our tap water? It has long been a source of national pride that we can drink straight from our taps without trepidation. But mounting scientific evidence shows that well-intentioned efforts to make our water healthier - by adding fluoride to prevent tooth decay - may actually be having serious long-term effects on our health. Scientists warn that the risks of this controversial public health policy include brain impairment in children, liver and kidney disease, crippling bone disorders and, ironically, disfigured teeth. Investigators also argue that fluoridation does not bring significant benefits over other health initiatives, such as encouraging children and adults to brush their teeth properly. Scientists warn that the risks of 'water fluoridation' include brain impairment in children, liver and kidney disease, crippling bone disorders and, ironically, disfigured teeth . Yesterday, a new danger was added to the risk list when researchers at the University of Kent warned that the mineral may be responsible for causing depression, weight gain and tiredness. They argue that these debilitating symptoms are the result of hypothyroidism — the failure of the thyroid gland to produce hormones that regulate the metabolism. Their study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, says that areas of England with water fluoridation are linked to rates of hypothyroidism 30 per cent higher than expected. The watchdog Public Health England moved to assure people that 'the totality of evidence, accumulated over decades of research, tells us that water fluoridation is a safe and effective public health measure, and shows no association with reduced thyroid function'. But Professor Stephen Peckham, who led the new study, said that instead of putting more fluoride in our water, the policy should be reversed: 'Consideration needs to be given to reducing fluoride exposure,' he said. New research found areas of England with water fluoridation are linked to rates of hypothyroidism 30 per cent higher than expected. Hypothyroidism causes depression, weight gain and tiredness (file photo) That may not be so easily done. More than five-and-a-half million of us already have tap water artificially fluoridated to the 'optimum' level of one part per million parts of water (1ppm), according to the British Fluoridation Society (BFS). More than five-and-a-half million of us already have tap water artificially fluoridated to the 'optimum' level of one part per million parts of water (1ppm), according to the British Fluoridation Society (BFS). Areas of the country with fluoridation schemes include Cumbria, Cheshire, Tyneside, Northumbria, Durham, Humberside, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, the West Midlands and Bedfordshire. A further 330,000 people drink supplies that are naturally fluoridated by rocks in the ground to the level of 1ppm — including residents of Hartlepool and Easington in the North East of England, Uttoxeter in Staffordshire and parts of North Hampshire and South Berkshire. (Other parts of Britain, which are not artificially fluoridated and have low natural levels of fluoride in local rocks, see concentrations of 0.1ppm or even lower in their drinking water.) Greater fluoridation would cut the admission to hospital of some 26,000 children aged between five and nine for tooth decay, doctors have warned . That's about one in ten of the population exposed to the 1ppm fluoride level, says the BFS, which promotes the treatment of UK water. The medicinal use of fluorides for the prevention of dental decay began in January 1945 when community water supplies in Grand Rapids, America, were fluoridated to 1ppm. But health concerns have meant that in recent years that level has been reduced in the U.S. to 0.7ppm. Nonetheless, politicians and dentists here are pushing for more of us to have our water supplemented to that 1ppm level. More than five-and-a-half million of us already have tap water artificially fluoridated to the 'optimum' level of one part per million parts of water (1ppm), according to the British Fluoridation Society (BFS). Areas of the country with fluoridation schemes include Cumbria, Cheshire, Tyneside, Northumbria, Durham, Humberside, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, the West Midlands and Bedfordshire. A further 330,000 people drink supplies that are naturally fluoridated by rocks in the ground to the level of 1ppm — including residents of Hartlepool and Easington in the North East of England, Uttoxeter in Staffordshire and parts of North Hampshire and South Berkshire. (Other parts of Britain, which are not artificially fluoridated and have low natural levels of fluoride in local rocks, see concentrations of 0.1ppm or even lower in their drinking water.) Only last month, leaders at the Royal College of Surgeons' faculty of dental surgery published a report saying greater fluoridation would cut the admission to hospital annually of some 26,000 children aged between five and nine for tooth decay. 'Water fluoridation is one way of overcoming that,' said the faculty's dean, professor Nigel Hunt. In December, Labour shadow health secretary Andy Burnham pledged to make a priority of adding fluoride to water if his party wins the Election. 'It's a simple way to improve the health of children. There is no evidence it damages health,' he argued. Certainly, it's recognised by the NHS that fluoride disrupts the process of decay by making enamel more resistant to acid attack — which is the cause of rotting teeth — and reducing plaque bacteria's ability to produce acid. The mineral also strengthens enamel in children's growing teeth. However, if a chemical affects the human body in one way, it is almost certainly bound to change other things. And it is these side-effects that particularly alarm some scientists. It is also worth noting that the mineral which occurs naturally in water is calcium fluoride, while the chemical used to supplement levels of water is sodium fluoride — which critics say can be more dangerous to health. As well as specifically physical side-effects related to fluoridation, there are also concerns over its effect on our brains. A 2012 analysis of previous studies found strong indications that fluoride supplementation may hinder children's intellectual development, causing on average a drop of seven IQ points. Fluoride in water may also harm internal organs. A Polish laboratory study found evidence of liver damage that seems to have been caused by the fluoride interfering with the way our bodies use antioxidants to defend against tissues breaking down. There are also suspected links with kidney disease. One study has found an association between high levels of fluoride in the water and painful kidney stones, which were four times more common than in a similar area without high fluoride, researchers found. Scientists warn that the risks of adding fluoride to water include brain impairment in children, liver and kidney disease, crippling bone disorders and, ironically, disfigured teeth (file picture) The most obvious evidence of harm from fluoride supplementation is dental fluorosis, where teeth become mottled and discoloured by over-exposure. It is also possible that chronic bone disease skeletal fluorosis can be caused by ingesting large amounts of fluoride, which can lead to crippling arthritis, bone fractures and muscle weakness. In response to the established risks, it is recommended by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency that an adult does not consume more than 3-4mg of fluoride per day — the equivalent of drinking three to four litres of water with 1ppm fluoride (the UK has established no maximum RDA of fluoride). But it is more complicated than that. The dangers from exposure to fluoride have been increased over the past few years as the mineral has increasingly been added to commercial products — not only toothpaste but others such as baby milk formula. Even tea can push you over the limit, especially in areas with fluoridated water. A study by Derby University found cheap supermarket tea is particularly high in the mineral, which occurs in it naturally. Four mugs of tea can contain as much as 6mg. Nevertheless, local authorities are currently pushing, with the encouragement of Public Health England, to fluoridate more people's water. But the backlash has begun. Earlier this month, protesters in Hull launched a campaign to halt the city council's plans to add fluoride to their water. Figures show 43 per cent of children in Hull are suffering tooth decay, one of the worst rates in the country. However, local protesters, such as Paddy Holdsworth, of East Yorkshire Against Fluoride, fear the dangers of unwanted side-effects. 'This is compulsory medication,' he says. 'It is just crazy.' Another obstacle lies in the path of the pro-fluoridation camp — a significant hole in their argument that mineral supplementation is the best way to improve mass dental health . About ten years ago, a review of previous evidence by York University researchers found that tooth decay in children across Europe had fallen, irrespective of fluoride in the water. Indeed, the countries showing the biggest decrease — Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark — do not fluoridate their supplies. 'This probably reflects use of fluoridated toothpastes and other factors, including perhaps nutrition,' said the investigators in the British Medical Journal, who concluded that the evidence 'on the potential benefits and harms of adding fluoride to water is relatively poor'. This argument was perhaps unwittingly reinforced last year by national survey evidence from Public Health England itself. The authority warned that drinking fruit juice and squash from bottles and feeding cups was responsible for significant amounts of tooth decay, and called for under-threes to have milk and water. And surely it is just such mass education — not mass medication — that in the long term will improve dental health. Our health chiefs should treat us as adults. Rather than slipping something into our water, isn't it high time these authorities introduced sanctions against parents who fecklessly allow their children's teeth to rot? Drinking fruit juice and squash from bottles and feeding cups was responsible for significant amounts of tooth decay, and called for under-threes to have milk and water instead .","Researchers have said the mineral could cause depression and weight gain .

"A lawyer for Jodi Arias pleaded for his client's life Tuesday as he told the jury deciding whether she'll be put to death that the ex-lover she killed sexually humiliated her and wanted to keep their trysts secret. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi began closing arguments in Arias' sentencing retrial by showing photos from happy moments in her life, such as an image of Arias resting her chin on boyfriend Travis Alexander's shoulder amid a forested background. Nurmi said Arias' problems stem from a personality disorder in which she tries to mold herself to the wishes of the men she dates. Nurmi portrayed Arias' former boyfriend Travis Alexander as a man divided between his Mormon faith and sexual desires that led him to have relationships with several women. Begging to live: Jodi Arias adjusts her glasses during the sentencing retrial at Maricopa County Superior Court February 18 in Phoenix where her attorney begged for the killer's life in his closing arguments Tuesday . The attorney said Alexander used Arias to quench his sexual urges, called her demeaning names and told her she was soulless. 'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. Arias was convicted in 2013 of murdering Alexander, but her first jury deadlocked on her punishment. A jury that has been hearing testimony since mid-October will decide whether to sentence her to life in prison or death. Prosecutors said Arias attacked Alexander in a jealous rage because he wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. Arias has acknowledged killing Alexander but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. Sexual humiliation?

Prosecutor Juan Martinez is scheduled to make his closing arguments later Tuesday. Arias often looked at the jury as her attorney pleaded for the more lenient sentence. Her sentencing retrial has dragged on for several months amid a series of expert witnesses and the surprising October decision by Judge Sherry Stephens to remove reporters and spectators from the courtroom so Arias could testify in private. A higher court halted the testimony on its second day amid complaints from news organization. The retrial revealed few new details about the crime and was more subdued than Arias' first trial, which turned into a media circus. At the retrial, the judge barred the broadcast of footage from the proceedings until after a verdict is reached. She did, however, agree to allow live broadcast coverage of the sentencing verdict. Arias passed up a chance Monday to address the jury, saying she wanted to make such comments but insisting the courtroom be cleared. Gruesome: Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slit his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shot him in the forehead .

"Lindsay Lohan has been ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service for a reckless driving charge - after she tried to pass off time on stage in London as volunteering. The 28-year-old actress had previously been ordered to perform 240 hours of community service as part of a plea deal she struck after her Porsche rear-ended a truck in California in 2012. But while appearing in the West End production 'Speed The Plow' last year, she let young people 'shadow' her and logged it as community hours. The court 'had a problem with some of the work shadowing,' Lohan's attorney, Shawn Holley, told the Los Angeles Times. 'They didn't want to hear more about how that played out.' Back to work: Lindsay Lohan, pictured in London this week, has been ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service for a reckless driving charge after she failed to complete her service appropriately . The ruling means that rather than finish her probation in March as planned, Lohan faces another three months of community service - but her attorney said she has no problem with it. 'She's enjoying doing community service,' Holley told the LA Times. 'Her passion is really working with kids... and kids really respond to her.' The judge made the decision in private and a hearing will now be held on March 12 to decide how the actress is to complete her community service. After Lohan had been ordered to carry out 240 hours of court-ordered community service, she vowed to complete it at the London-based charity Community Service Volunteers (CSV). But according to tmz, prosecutor Terry White examined the hours she spent at the organisation and had planned to tell the judge she had violated her probation. On stage: Lohan (with Richard Schiff as film boss Bobby Gould) starred as a secretary in 'Speed The Plow' by David Mamet at the Playhouse Theatre in London - and tried to claim the hours for community service . Lindsay Lohan had promised to complete 240 hours of court-ordered community service at the London-based charity Community Service Volunteers (pictured) but has now been ordered to complete more . On one occasion, the actress was given six hours credit but two of those hours were for a matinee performance of Speed The Plow, a further two were for an evening performance while two more hours were taken up with a meet-and-greet event afterwards, White reportedly found. Miss Lohan arrived in London last autumn to star in a West End production of David Mamet's play, the movie business satire Speed The Plow. She played a forthright secretary in the production at London's Playhouse Theatre. Mr White told The Mail on Sunday that a prison sentence would not be ruled out for Miss Lohan if she is found in breach of her probation terms. On Sunday, CSV chief executive Oonagh Aitken said the organisation took its 'responsibilities in relation to all kinds of volunteering with great seriousness'.","The actress, 28, was ordered to complete 240 hours of community service for a California car crash - but has now been ordered to finish even more .

"Two prominent anti-aging scientists have shaken on a million dollar wager over who will live the longest. Dmitry Kaminskiy and Alex Zhavoronkov placed the bet last month at an anti-aging conference and the deal is that the first one to die will immediately owe the other a million dollars in stock or cash. Both men are evangelists for new drugs and technology that might extend the human life by fighting age-related diseases. Dmitry Kaminskiy, left, and Alex Zhavoronkov placed the bet last month at an anti-aging conference and the deal is that the first one to die will immediately owe the other a million dollars in stock or cash . Shake on it! Both men are evangelists for new drugs and technology that might extend the human life by fighting age-related disease . Kaminskiy is a senior partner at Deep Knowledge Ventures in Hong Kong, while Zhavoronkov is the CEO of the anti-aging drug company Insilico Medicine in Russia. They also believe that the competition is a way to combat psychological aging and ensure each man's continued desire to live. 'If one of the parties passes away before the other, $1 million in Insilico Medicine stock will be passed to the surviving party,' the agreement stated, adding that if the company is no longer in existence the other has to pay up the dollar amount in cash. Another condition of the bet is that both men have to live past 100 years. That will happen on February 24, 2079, when Zhavoronkov - who has just turned 36 - turns 100. He is a year younger than Kaminskiy. 'Longevity competitions may be a great way to combat both psychological and biological aging,' Dr. Zhavoronkov told Zoltan Istvan of Gizmodo. 'I hope that we will start a trend.' The two scientists believe the competition is a way to combat psychological aging and ensure each man's continued desire to live beyond 100 . Zhavoronkov has been taking low-dose aspirin since 1998 plus an anti-aging cocktail of statins and other supplements for over four and a half years is confident that he will win the bet. He's also had an HPV shot to prevent cancer and takes other drugs to avoid getting the flu. However he admitted to ABC that Kaminskiy may have an advantage because he has family has a history of living longer, while he also enjoys a more stable sleeping pattern and regularly exercises. 'Access to a few hundred million dollars, state of the art information systems and a venture fund investing in longevity companies also helps,' said Kaminskiy. 'But I still believe in the power of simple, affordable and reasonably safe interventions.'","Dmitry Kaminskiy and Alex Zhavoronkov placed the bet last month  and the deal is that the first one to die will immediately owe the other a million dollars .

"For Washington state mother Amanda Skorjanc, her 16-month-old son Duke is more than just her beloved child - he is a daily reminder that miracles do happen. Duke Suddarth was the youngest survivor of the devastating Oso mudslide that killed 43 people in March 2014. Duke, then only 5 months old, was mere seconds away from death when Good Samaritan Kody Wesson plucked him from the debris as his mother, Amanda, lay helpless nearby with two injured legs after their home was destroyed by the massive mudslide and they were carried 600 feet. Scroll down for video . Miracle boy: Duke Suddarth, pictured left and right with his mother, Amanda, was the youngest survivor of last year's deadly Oso mudslide in Washington State . Tiny survivor: Good Samaritan Kody Wesson pulled then-five-month-old Duke from the rubble when his parents' home was destroyed March 22, 2014 . Never forget: On the eve of the first anniversary of the landslide that killed 43, Amanda Skorjanc (second left) looked back on that devastating day . Ignoring the commands of a state trooper not to enter the devastation, Wesson climbed into the debris field to look for survivors. When he spotted 22-week-old Duke lying on the ground with his face covered in bruises, he picked him up, wrapped him in his coat and carried him to safety. Duke was rushed to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle in serious condition, but he made a remarkable recovery and was discharged a month later. Amid the death and devastation of the natural disaster, Duke's incredible tale of survival gave the people of the region a reason to rejoice in their darkest hour. Nearly a year after the tragedy, Duke's mother, Amanda Skorjanc, cannot help but smile whenever she sets eyes on her precious boy. Happy reunion: Three weeks after baby Duke Suddarth was rescued from the brink of death, Arlington firefighter paramedic Marty Ruffner and EMT Jason Brisson were reunited with the young life they helped save .

Getting better: Baby Duke, pictured here last April with Arlington firefighter paramedic Marty Ruffner and EMT Jason Brisson, suffered a skull fracture and may have to undergo another surgery . ‘You can’t look at him and not think, ‘How amazing is this little kid!’” Ms Skorjanc told KING5 this week, looking back on her son’s journey. ‘He is a light in something that was so dark and sad in a lot of people's lives… he’s that little bit of hope that everybody had,’ Duke’s mother said . A total of 43 people died after a massive landslide buried homes and a highway 55 miles northeast of Seattle March 22. Skorjanc and her baby were among the few pulled from the rubble alive. Amanda Skorjanc says she has been reliving the moment the mudslide hit their community every day anew. Looking back on that day in March, she remembers holding onto Duke for dear life and vowing to herself that she would not let him go. When the worst of the landslide was over, the young mother found herself pinned under a pile of debris 600 feet from her ravaged home and suffering from a broken arm, a broken ankle and a large cut on her foot. Laughing it off: Skorjanc and Duke have been kept busy with countless medical check-ups and physical therapy sessions . Inspiration: Skorjanc says her son gives her the strength to get out of bed in the morning and keep going . Precious life: Skorjanc says when Duke is old enough to learn about the mudslide, she would try to convey to him how special he is . Skorjanc was still cradling baby Duke in her arms, only now he had a fractured skull and was blue and covered in dirt. Being unable to move due to her injuries, Amanda handed her precious bundle to a passerby, Kody Wesson, who heard her screams from the road and rushed over to help. Eventually, a helicopter came and airlifted Amanda Skorjanc to a hospital for treatment. Much has changed since last March: Amanda is now engaged to Duke’s dad; their baby is on the road to recovery, and their community is trying to cope with the trauma one day at a time. But the young family still acutely feel the after-effects of that terrible day. 'It will always be a part of our lives,' she says.

"Ed Balls was involved in a bizarre interview tonight about his sex life in which he suggested he was a ‘long slow burn’ in bed. In comments likely to embarrass his wife Yvette Cooper, he commented on a survey by Mumsnet which found women believe he would make one of the best lovers in the Commons. Women revealed their crushes on the Shadow Chancellor, who was described as a ‘sexy beast’, as well as Boris Johnson – who was described as fun in bed. Scroll down for video . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls during the bizarre interview where he claimed to be a 'long slow burn' in bed . An LBC Radio programme, hosted by Iain Dale, confronted Mr Balls with recordings from women and men on the street describing what they thought of his looks. One man said ‘Yikes. He could rock my world’, while a woman said: ‘He is quite attractive yes, I suppose’. Later commentators were not as complimentary, saying: ‘He's not unattractive but he's not attractive. Six out of 10?’, while another woman said: ‘Not particularly to my taste, he's a bit old for me.’ Mr Balls has been discussing his sex life after a survey by Mumsnet which found women believe he would make one of the best lovers in the Commons . 'Sexy beast' Ed Balls was a popular choice among mothers online, while Mumsnet users said they would rather bed Ed Miliband's brother than the Labour leader and said David Cameron is 'too arrogant to be generous' in the bedroom . Another said: ‘Would I want to spend the night with him? Hmm, if I'm desperate, maybe.’ Asked for his comments, Mr Balls said: ‘I thought that started well but slightly fell away towards the end.’ In a jokey exchange of comments, Mr Dale asked him: ‘Is that what happens with you, it starts well but you slightly fade away?’ Mr Balls replied: ‘No, long slow burn.’ Mr Dale then asked him whether the his wife Yvette Cooper – the Shadow Home Secretary – would relate to the comments. The Shadow Chancellor replied: ‘Nick Clegg showed why politicians shouldn't speculate on such matters so I think I won't go there.’ The presenter then asked him whether his leader would be annoyed with the survey. Ed Miliband was not described as a sexy beast – with women saying they would prefer a night of passion with David Miliband. Mr Balls refused to speculate on what his wife Yvette Cooper – the Shadow Home Secretary- (pictured with the MP) would make of his description of himself in bed as a 'long slow burn' Mr Balls joked: ‘It's another example of the return to our Blair-Brown bad relationship. I can't believe you're a sexy beast not me, what a load of tosh.’ Mr Dale them moved on to what Mr Balls thought of the fact that women believed the London Mayor would be fun in bed. The Shadow Chancellor replied: ‘I'm desperately trying to hold back on making libellous statements. Personally I don't know if Boris Johnson's fun in bed.’ At the end of Mr Balls’ appearance, he took a call from ‘Marie from Putney’ who said that despite starting a campaign four years ago for better-looking politicians, no progress had been made. Mr Balls asked her whether she found him attractive, saying: ‘Privately Marie, just between you and me, with nobody else listening, am I not on the list?’ Marie replied: ‘No, Ed, I'm sorry. You're a thoroughly great guy otherwise.’ Nick Clegg was deemed good-looking but likely to be a 'damp squib' in the bedroom, while many said Boris Johnson would be 'fun' Tony Blair was also mentioned by Mumsnet users, though some said he would be too busy looking in a mirror .","Ed Balls admitted during an interview on LBC he was a 'slow burn' in bed .

"Disgraced former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner got $129,300 in bonuses between 2010 and 2013, during the years when she allegedly supervised a program targeting conservative nonprofit groups with intrusive levels nad scrutiny that liberal group managed to avoid. Lerner, then in charge of the IRS's Exempt Organizations Division, drew a top-tier salary that reached $177,000 – plus a 25 per cent 'retention bonus.' That's a federal workforce perk designed to keep high-ranking officials from retiring or jumping to more lucrative offers in the private sector. Those annual bonuses, valued at an average of $43,000, only stopped because continuing them would have pushed her over the legal limit of how much a government employee can earn. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND DOCUMENTS . Former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner received massive cash bonuses from the federal government while her department was targeting conservative nonprofit groups for extra scrutiny based on political-sounding words in their names . Lerner famously appeared before Congress in May 2013 and offered an opening statement pleading her innocence – but then invoked her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer any questions . The Washington Free Beacon obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act request showing the shocking payouts, which came in the same three years – 2010, 2011 and 2012 – when her department was throwing up roadblocks that stopped hundreds of tea parties and other right-wing groups from obtaining the tax-exempt status they needed to operate and raise money. Steven T. Miller first recommended Lerner for a $42,000 retention bonus in December 2009, the Free Beacon reported, when he was the Acting IRS commissioner. She got $43,050 and $44,250 in the next two years. But in November 2012 the IRS determined that continuing to make the payouts each year would violate a federal regulation that sets a hard limit on federal workers' earnings. With another retention bonus, she would have been earning more than the maximum allowed, which was $230,700. But at the end of 2009 she had become eligible for retirement, and Miller wanted to keep her on the job. 'Ms. Lerner is eligible for retirement and as an attorney with extensive experience would likely command a much greater pay and benefits if she left the Service,' he wrote then. 'Without a retention incentive she will leave the (Internal Revenue) Service.' 'Her unique blend of specialized technical expertise, broad organizational knowledge, and leadership skills cannot be matched,' he added at the time. Joseph Grant, Lerner's immediate supervisor as deputy commissioner of the tax-exempt division, approved the massive check along with Miller himself. Grant would later resign in disgrace in May 2013, at President Barack Obama's specific demand, after the depth of Lerner's alleged scheme became known Grant 'retired' one day later. Lerner waited until September 2013 for her own retirement, letting the calendar advance to the point where she earned a full federal government pension. In May 2013 Lerner launched one of the Obama administration's most political damaging scandals by planting a question during a tax accountants conference about how her subagency scrutinized right-wing tax exemption applicants that the administration thought might be political groups in disguise. She acknowledged that organizations with words like 'tea party' or 'patriot' in their names were processed differently, on a schedule that could stretch out for years. CRYING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK: Lerner retired with a full federal government pension . Lerner knew at the time that the IRS Office of Inspector General was ready to release an audit report exposing the practice of singling out conservatives. That report came out just four days later. The IRS, the inspector general wrote, 'used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention.' A congressional investigation, now nearly two years old, stalled in 2014 after IRS Commissioner John Koskinen claimed years' worth of Lerner's emails were lost during a hard-drive crash. Emails tha twere recovered showed Lerner caomplaining that political conservatives were 'crazies' and 'a**holes.'

"A medicine man performs an exorcism as he attempts to remove a 'curse' on the village where the deadly Ebola outbreak  is believed to have started. The traditional healer was attempting to remove the hex that locals believe has plagued their village of Meliandou in Guinea. It has been identified as 'ground zero' of the killer disease after two-year-old Emile Ouamouno died there in late December 2013. Exorcism: Healer Kalifa Lengo preparing to perform the exorcism in the village of Meliandou in Guinea . Curse: A goat is cooked on an open fire in the village, where two-year-old Emile Ouamouno was the first to die from Ebola in December 2013 .

As other villagers began dying, panic spread and traditional healer Kalifa Lengo was brought in to perform an exorcism ceremony. Etienne Ouamouno, father of Emine, said: 'He took away the witchcraft items that the people had lying around their homes.' But despite the removal of the items, people kept dying, causing hundreds to abandon the village, believing the Ouamouno family or the entire village, was cursed. As the death toll continued to soar, the traditional healer was brought in to perform an exorcism ceremony. This week, he returned to the tiny village to oversee the final stages of the rites that he first began last April. Removed: The village removed the witchcraft items that the people had lying around their homes that they believed led to the curse . Preparation: Singing, dancing and rites were performed near the tree during the colourful ceremony earlier this week . During his first visit, Lengo planted a banana tree in the center of the village and promised to return. The cutting of the plant, the elders say, will bring about the removal of the curse. Singing, dancing and rites were performed near the tree during the colourful ceremony earlier this week. A goat was cooked over a fire and a village elder threw rice at the tree. Here, as in many other villages across the continent, people still believe that Ebola was spread on purpose by people seeking some type of gain. Tradition: The Ebola outbreak has devastated West Africa and is believed to have killed more than 9,200 people across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone . Ebola, which is spread by the bodily fluids of a person showing symptoms of the disease, for which there is no known cure and which is usually fatal. Meliandou villagers remain deeply suspicious about who or what brought the disease that has devastated their lives.

"With luxurious surroundings and the world famous Waldorf salad created in the building, it is not hard to see why many celebrities, and even presidents, have made The Waldorf Astoria their permanent home. And now the New York hotel is aiming to attract a few more permanent residents, but turning the area containing the presidential suite and penthouses into exclusive apartments. Chinese insurance company Anbang reportedly paid $2billion to buy the hotel this month and plans to transform the top floor of the Manhattan hotel into the new apartments. The Waldorf Astoria in New York has done a deal with Chinese insurance company, Anbang, for $1.95 billion, one of the highest prices per room ever paid for a US hotel, to renovate the top floor for new apartments . The luxury Waldorf Astoria Hotel, in New York, is one of the city's most iconic hotels and a favourite with celebrities . The Towers are already made up of guest apartments but could well be turned into condominiums if new plans go through . According to real estate website The Real Deal reported Wu Xiaohui, chairman of Anbang, recently told Harvard students that 'a potential buyer needs to have more than money to qualify for our apartments.' Famous celebrities who have made the hotel their home have included Frank Sinatra who kept a personal suite at the hotel between 1979 and 1988 for when he was out of Los Angeles, for nearly $1 million a year. The Towers, within the Waldrof Hotel, has its own separate entrance and already houses apartments for guests, but  it is thought the whole area will be converted into condominiums. The hotel is famous for its central location on Park Avenue and the luxurious interiors in its suites, rooms and residences . Former presidents and celebrities including Marilyn Monroe are said to have set up home in the sumptuous hotel . The residences in The Tower offer a living room and dining area, a kitchenette and a master bedroom with an adjoining boudoir and marble bathroom . It was rumoured Sinatra and his wife etched their initials into the bathroom door but the door was extracted during refurbishment and its whereabouts are unknown. Actress Marilyn Monroe was reported to have lived at the Waldorf Astoria for several months, and songwriter Cole Porter and singer wife Linda Lee Thomas kept an apartment there, where Thomas died in 1954. Porter's 1934 song You're the Top, contains the lyric, You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad. Aside from celebrities, many presidents have made it their dwelling too. President Herbert Hoover resided at The Waldorf for more than three decades, and President Dwight Eisenhower stayed from 1967–1969. President Herbert Hoover, (left), resided at the Waldorf from 1932­ to 1964. Actress Marilyn Monroe (right) was reported to have lived at the Waldorf Astoria for several months .

Waldorf Astoria: The luxurious hotel reportedly employs someone to open windows as they are so heavy, they also employ  a chandelier cleaner and a two full-time tour guides . President Eisenhower's is reported to have been terrified of heights, and to accommodate them, a lift was specially designed to open on the 7th floor. The hotel apparently had an underground railroad which leads from the fourth floor of the basement to Grand Central Terminal, which was used as an entrance for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The Waldorf Astoria and Towers spans an entire Midtown Manhattan block, 49th to 50th Street from Park to Lexington Avenues and boasts 1413 hotel rooms. The famous Waldorf salad was created by Oscar Tschirky, who is known globally as Oscar of the Waldorf.

"One man who walked inside said he was cuffed to a bench for 17 hours. Another was only found after he was transferred to the hospital with a head injury. A third ended up dead. What did all three men have in common? They had been taken to Homan Square. Operated by the Chicago police, Homan Square is an unmarked warehouse on the West Side where local attorneys and a protester claim Chicago police are operating a CIA-style 'black site.' Operated by the Chicago police, Homan Square is an unmarked warehouse on the West Side where local attorneys and a protester claim Americans have been shackled for hours and denied basic rights . In a story by the Guardian, Brian Jacob Church said it took his lawyers  hours to locate him in what he called a 'domestic black site'. 'It brings to mind the interrogation facilities they use in the Middle East,' he said. 'When you go in, no one knows what's happened to you.' Church was brought to Homan Square in 2012 with 11 other people after protesting the NATO summit and said he was denied his right to call a lawyer, was not read his Miranda rights and had to sit in a windowless cell. He said for 17 hours his ankles were shackled together and one wrist was cuffed to a bar behind a bench. Church, a member of the NATO 3 who was eventually incarcerated for two and a half years before he was found not guilty of terrorism-related charges, said he figured he'd never see 'the light of day again'. Sarah Gelsomino, Church's lawyer, said she searched for her client, whose name wasn't on any jail booking records, for 12 hours before she learned Homan Square even existed. Brian Jacob Church said it took lawyers 17 hours to locate him in what he called a 'domestic black site' When Church was finally able to talk to an attorney, he claimed they spoke through a 'floor-to-ceiling chain-link metal cage'. Almost a full day had past before Church was booked at a nearby police station. One Chicago lawyer called Homan Square an 'open secret'. 'If you can't find a client in the system, odds are they're there,' Julia Bartmes told the Guardian. Another attorney, Anthony Hill, said people who are taken to Homan Square 'just disappear' until they are either charged or released. Hill said police use the warehouse as an 'off the books' interrogation space when they want information about the flow of money, guns and drugs on the streets. Eliza Solowiej, of Chicago's First Defense Legal Aid, said she couldn't find one man for 'six to eight hours', last seeing him in a police station before he was transferred to Homan Square. She said later that day the man, who asked to remain anonymous and whose lawyer declined to confirm Solowiej's account, sent  a  picture to her phone showing he had received head injuries. Solowiej didn't find him until after he was taken to the hospital. John Hubbard was another man taken to Homan Square, but he did not make it out alive. A Chicago Tribune story reported he was pronounced dead after being found 'unresponsive in an interview room'. A medical examiner told the Guardian that, after publication, it was determined he died of a heroin overdose. Three attorneys recounted to the Guardian incidents in which they were denied access to their clients at Homan Square. Bartmes said she was once refused entry into the warehouse when she went to check on a 15-year-old boy who had been taken there hours ago. She said the boy was eventually returned home, with no charges, after 'maybe 13 hours in custody'. The Chicago police department has responded to the Guardian's story, claiming that Homan Square is just like any other police facility in the city. Police spokesman Marty Maloney said: 'If lawyers have a client detained at Homan Square, just like any other facility, they are allowed to speak and visit to them.' 'There are always records of anyone who is arrested by CPD, and this is not any different at Homan Square.' The statement added that the facility is not a secret and that the public can access its Evidence Recovered Property Section to claim inventoried property, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Maloney also said the Guardian's report of physical violence at the warehouse 'is unequivocally false, is offensive, and it is not supported by any facts whatsoever'.","Homan Square is an unmarked warehouse on the West Side .

"A woman who tried to smuggle almost £3million-worth of fake toothbrushes and razor blades has been sentenced to 15 months in prison. Jocelyn Hunter was caught trying to illegally import the Oral B toothbrushes and Gillette Fusion razor blades in a complex scam which took place over the course of a year. The 42-year-old from Swindon, Wiltshere, bought the bathroom products - which had not been tested for cancer-causing chemicals - from dodgy suppliers in China. Dodgy goods: Jocelyn Hunter was sentenced to 15 months in prison for importing nearly £3million worth of fake toothbrushes and razor blades (pictured) Hunter then flogged the items  which had an estimated 'street value' of £2.7million to customers in mainland Europe. She believed it would be easier to get the illegal goods into the continent through Britain's 'lax' border security. Her operation was discovered when customs officers seized the goods at the Coventry Postal Hub and informed the brand holder, Proctor and Gamble. At the time of her arrest, a large box of counterfeit Oral B toothbrush heads was found in her living room. The large-scale scame lasted between May 2 and June 30, 2011 - during which time she received 248 parcels from China. John Jacobs, from Scambusters South West, said: 'The sentence reflects the seriousness of the offences Hunter has been convicted of and this case demonstrates the varied and widespread nature of counterfeiting activity. Illegal import: 42-year-old Hunter from Swindon, Wiltshere, made contact with dodgy suppliers in China who provided her with the fake bathroom products (pictured) 'It is far from a victimless crime, not only are they of a significantly inferior quality they are often produced by workers barely able to survive on the wages received.' Lord Toby Harris, Chair of National Trading Standards, said: 'It is great news that this criminal has been brought to justice and I commend all parties involved. 'People are often lured in by the promise of a bargain but many counterfeit products, while they may look like the real thing, can be very low quality and in some cases unsafe. 'I would urge people to help National Trading Standards to catch these criminals by remaining vigilant and reporting any products they think may be counterfeit to their local trading standards office or Citizens Advice.'","Elaborate scam landed Jocelyn Hunter, 42, a 15-month prison sentence .

"If you're reading this article while instant-messaging a friend and getting ready to Skype your mom, the latest episode of Modern Family will really strike a chord. The episode of the hit-comedy, which aired on Wednesday night, was shot completely using iPhones, iPads, and Macbook pros to show how relatives today stay in touch with the help of their high-tech devices. Show producer Steve Levitan says he got the idea for the episode while talking to one of his college-aged daughters on FaceTime. Innovative: Wednesday night's episode of Modern Family  was shot completely on Apple devices (cast member Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who plays Mitchell Pritchett is pictured) The episode titled 'Connection Lost' takes place on Dunphy family matriarch Claire's laptop (cast member Ed O'Neill who plays Jay Pritchett is seen in front of the iPhone camera) Innovative: Wednesday night's episode was to show how relatives today communicate with the help of their high-tech devices . Slice of modern life: The show takes place on Dunphy family matriarch Claire's laptop, as she waits at an airport and talks to various members of her family on her laptop . 'I had emails open, some websites... then my daughter showed up' Levitan recounted. 'I could not only see her, but I could see me, and there was something going on behind me, my wife or somebody.' How we live now: Modern Family's executive producer Steven Levitan says he got the idea for the episode while talking with his college-aged daughter over Facetime . 'I realized on that screen, you could tell so much about my life.' Apple apparently 'loved the idea' when he pitched the episode, and offered to provide devices for the show - though Levitan maintains that it is not product placement. 'This is the way my family communicates. We happen to be an Apple family. This is the technology that I know. 'If Claire started contacting everybody through Google Hangouts, it would have felt less believable to me because I don't know anybody who uses it that way. It doesn't mean people don't, but I don't. 'Samsung makes beautiful TVs. They make beautiful phones. It just so happens that I use Apple, so it's the way that makes sense for me,' he said. The episode titled 'Connection Lost' takes place on Dunphy family matriarch Claire's laptop, as she sits in Chicago's O'Hare airport waiting for a flight back to Los Angeles. She's trying to reach her daughter Haley over video message when other members of the family start popping in to say hi on her computer screen. 'You'll see how Claire navigates around the computer, the various sites she visits, the way she interacts with everybody through Facebook, Facetime and e-mails,' Levitan told USA Today. 'Somehow, we managed to get all 11 characters into the episode.' The computer set-up of the episode apparently provides for some pretty humorous situations. In one scene, Claire is talking to her brother Mitch when they talk about her birthday and the fact that she hasn't received a gift from him. Critically acclaimed: ABC's Modern Family has won the Emmy for best TV comedy the last five years running . Meanwhile, on Mitch's screen, he starts online shopping for a belated present. The episode took a bit longer to create since it involved more work in post-production to create all of the pages Claire is seen interacting with on her computer. However, Levitan says loyal viewers will appreciate the extra work. 'This episode is loaded with detail. There are little Easter eggs from past episodes and nods to people in our lives. My wife, for example, is one of Claire's Facebook friends,' he said. Viewers should also look out for a reference to Croctopus 4, a fictional movie featured in an earlier episode and Claire's daughter Alex's college application essay. The special iPhone episode of Modern Family aired on Wednesday night on ABC at 9pm ET/PT. The sitcom about three branches of a California family has won the Emmy Award for best TV comedy for the past five years. 'We happen to be an Apple family': Levitan (pictured) says the show was shot completely using only Apple devices, but that it's no product placement . For this week's ""Modern Family,"" producers put down their expensive professional cameras and shot the episode with iPhones and other Apple devices. Seen through the eyes of character Claire Dunphy as she uses a Mac laptop, characters only appear on her computer's FaceTime video-calling app. The Associated Press spoke with series co-creator and executive producer Steve Levitan about the thinking behind shooting with a smartphone and lessons learned. The episode, ""Connection Lost,"" airs on ABC at 9 p.m. EST Wednesday and is available online Thursday (Hulu Plus, cable or satellite subscription required until next week). Questions and answers have been edited for clarity and length. Q. What did you find most surprising? A. We thought the actors would be their own camera person originally, but it's just a lot for them to have to get everything framed just right. We quickly devised a method where a camera person held the phone just in front of them. So that it didn't look like the phone was floating in space, we always had an actor put their hand on the cameraman's hand. That made it look like they were doing a selfie thing. Q. How does the iPhone compare with traditional cameras? A. When you have a controlled environment, it's easy to get nice-looking images. The challenge comes when you're dealing with extremes — extreme brightness and darkness. The cameras we typically use cost tens of thousands of dollars and use lenses that cost just as much. You're going to always get a better quality with those. But the phone's quality is quite good. It's just amazing what's happened to smartphones in five years. Q. Could you have achieved the same effect with professional cameras? A. We wanted it to look as real as possible, so rather than shoot it on this incredible camera and then dumb the image down a bit so it looks like an iPhone, why not just shoot it with an iPhone? This is certainly good enough for our purposes, and it made the most sense. Q. Where do you see this going, not just with iPhones but other consumer gadgets such as GoPro video cameras and digital SLRs? A. It opens up filmmaking to people who don't have the resources for expensive equipment. There's a movie at the Sundance film festival this year that was shot on an iPhone. You really can, if you wanted to, shoot a movie on an iPhone or a thousand-dollar camera and then edit it on your computer. If you're clever enough, it can look like an expensive movie. That said, filmmaking is not just about having the technology and the camera. It's also about having a vision and the story. That's always going to rely on good old-fashioned human ingenuity. Q. How do you avoid making the equipment the center of the attention? A. The really compelling part here is the story telling, not so much how we did it technologically. At the end of the day, this story needed to be told this way. It's an emotional story, and it's a funny story. Ultimately when you have that going for you, it keeps this from becoming a gimmick. While the iPhone thing is a nice headline, I hope ultimately people remember this as a compelling episode. Q. There are lots of Android and Windows users out there. Do you worry about criticism that you are focusing too much on Apple? A. This is the way my family communicates. We happen to be an Apple family. This is the technology that I know. If Claire started contacting everybody through Google Hangouts, it would have felt less believable to me because I don't know anybody who uses it that way. It doesn't mean people don't, but I don't. Samsung makes beautiful TVs. They make beautiful phones. It just so happens that I use Apple, so it's the way that makes sense for me. (After producers reached out to Apple, the company provided devices, but didn't pay for their inclusion.) Q. Any tips for budding filmmakers? A. Using this kind of technology is nothing but a means to an end. The more important thing is to spend time on the story and the characters and make sure you have something compelling that's worth actually using these devices for. If you don't, it's very easy to come up with beautiful images and fun camera tricks. The real difficult part is to have something worth filming. That's where you should put the bulk of your time and energy.

"A schoolboy who had his hair cut like football idol Sergio Aguero has been ordered to wear a hat in lessons or stay home until it grows back, his family claim. Ten-year-old Tom Moseley was told his short back and sides hairstyle, modelled on the Manchester City striker's look, was too extreme by staff St Gilbert's Primary School in Winton, Eccles, and he was removed from school on his birthday. His family say they were told he could either return to classes when his hair had grown, restyle it or wear a hat at all times. Scroll down for video .

Mr Moseley said: 'Sergio Aguero is his idol and he has had that haircut for six months. 'He is being punished for a haircut but he has consistently achieved good results and is well behaved in class. 'We were given three options - take him out of school until it grows, get it cut or sit in class wearing a hat and he won't be allowed to play football at school. He would also have to sit outside the headteacher's office at break times wearing the hat.

But headteacher Cheryl Fox said: 'We set clear standards on hair and dress at this school which parents are made fully aware of and accept when pupils enrol. 'We always suggest that an unsuitable haircut can be trimmed into an acceptable style without going down the skinhead route or that the child can wear a hat of their choice in school. 'If the parents wish to keep the child away from school until the haircut grows out we will ensure their education does not suffer. 'It's our responsibility to prepare children for high school, college, university and employment where they will be expected to follow the rules of the establishment or dress code of their employer.

"A British tourist who had become 'infatuated' with Thailand plunged 300ft to his death in a mystery fall from a 36th-floor apartment. Detectives are investigating how John Knotts, of Blaydon in Gateshead, came to fall from the Sky Beach Condominium in North Pattaya. John Westgarth, a friend of Mr Knotts, revealed how the 49-year-old loved Thailand so much he had become 'addicted' and would go several times a year. This time he had gone to the country to see a girlfriend he had met previously and had emailed to say he had missed his flight home. John Knotts (right) plunged 36 storeys to his death from an apartment block in Thailand, just a day after his friend John Westgarth (left) had sent him an email warning he faced a 'very big fall' because of his lifestyle . Mr Westgarth responded by email and told his friend about the dangers of his lifestyle and warned him he was 'heading for a big fall.' A day later he was told Mr Knotts had died. Thai newspapers reported that Mr Knotts had been to a Chinese New Year Party with his girlfriend Khun Kullaya, 47, before he fell from the apartment. Mr Knotts first went on holiday to Thailand ten years ago and despite being on benefits would visit up to five times a year. He went to Thailand on January 7 to see his girlfriend and the couple had planned a trip to Bangkok to get her a visa. Mr Knotts fell from the 36th floor of the apartment block in Pattaya in Thailand . Mr Knotts was only supposed to be away for 28 days and was due back on February 3, but missed his flight and never returned. 'I was on holiday in Kenya and I emailed him saying it was nearly home time for him,' said Mr Westgarth, 64. 'I never got a reply. I then texted him something similar and never got a reply. 'I then sent him another email saying 'have you missed your flight again?' 'He emailed me back saying ""yeah, I've done it again. I've missed my flight"".' Mr Westgarth said everything started to go wrong with his friend since he developed an obsession with Thailand. He added: 'He was a likeable character. Since he started to go to Thailand, everything centred around the country. 'It was worse than heroin. He wouldn't admit to being addicted but he was addicted to the place. 'He was 10 days over his visa. 'He lost all interest in England. He was there and he didn't want to be anywhere else.' Mr Westgarth said his friend had one or two relationships during his visits to Thailand over the 10 years and was 'looking to fall in love.' Mr Knotts died at around 10pm on February 18. Local newspaper Pattaya One reported that his girlfriend had suffered facial injuries and he was in financial difficulty, with his home in Newcastle about to be repossessed. Detectives are continuing to investigate the circumstances of Mr Knotts' death.","John Knotts was 'infatuated' with Thailand and would visit five times a year .

"Police in Rotherham have come under fire for holding a self-congratulatory awards ceremony just two weeks after a damning report accused the force of letting down sexually abused children. A ceremony in the town last week praised officers for going 'above and beyond the call of duty' - and South Yorkshire Police then used its public Facebook page to boast about the event. Local residents reacted with anger, pointing out that 16 days earlier the force was criticised for turning a blind eye to the abuse of 1,400 young girls. The area's police commissioner said it was 'misguided' to publicise the ceremony at Rotherham United's New York Stadium, adding: 'I have very little sympathy.' Awards: Rotherham police have been criticised for holding an awards ceremony just two weeks after a damning report found that they had failed to investigate child sex abuse . The event last Friday was held to honour officers from South Yorkshire Police working in the Rotherham area 'for their outstanding contributions to the town's police force'. The force said in a Facebook post that the ceremony recognised 'officers and staff who went above and beyond the call of duty to protect and serve the public'. But hundreds of people commented on the post accusing police of 'really bad timing' and saying they should be 'ashamed'. Alan Billings, who was elected as South Yorkshire's police and crime commissioner after his precedessor Shaun Wright was forced to resign in disgrace, criticised the decision to publish details of the awards. Boast: Officers were awarded for going 'above and beyond the call of duty' at the ceremony . 'Misguided': Local police commissioner Alan Billings criticised the force for publicising the event . 'I have very little sympathy,' said Dr Billings, who attended the ceremony. 'I can completely understand the reaction. 'If someone asked me for advice I would have advised against that. I think it's probably misguided to put it on Facebook. 'I did go and talk to the district commander and the team before the awards and they did wrestle with the decision to hold it or not and they decided they would go ahead.' Report: Louise Casey, pictured, found that South Yorkshire Police neglected its duty over sex abuse . Local councillor Emma Wallis wrote on Twitter: 'An award ceremony for Rotherham cops at NYS? Whilst rapists still stalk our streets? Couldn't make it up.' South Yorkshire Police came under heavy criticism from a report published earlier this month by Louise Casey which investigated the reaction of officers and council officials to allegations of child sex abuse in Rotherham. The report said that police had dismissed victims' complaints and referred to the girls involved as 'little slags' who were complicit in their own abuse. One corrupt officer was even accused of having sex with a vulnerable child, and is now under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The report concluded: 'The police's historic attitude towards, and treatment of, victims has been unacceptable. 'Inspectors are concerned that this attitude continues in the police to this day, with treatment of current victims remaining at an unacceptably low standard.' Most of those who commented on the police awards ceremony expressed disgust at the decision to honour officers so soon after the report's publication. Ellen Lawless wrote: 'Abuse scandal clearly a distant memory already! But then I suppose its easy to forget something you've spent years ignoring anyway! You ought to be ashamed! Disgusting.' Neil Richards added: 'Really bad timing considering how incompetent they are over child grooming.' And Tony Hand said: 'I wonder who won the turning a blind eye award? Bet all the council and police chiefs were nominated for that one!' Anger: Facebook users accused the force of being insensitive over the awards ceremony . However, some defended the officers involved in the ceremony, saying that they should not be held responsible for the mistakes of the force as a whole. Rotherham's police commander Jason Harwin said the force 'recognised that people must be held to account' over the scandal, but added: 'We also need to recognise when people do a good job and promote the exceptional work that takes place every day. 'The awards are a great way to recognise the dedication and commitment of our officers, staff and members of the community, who work tirelessly to make Rotherham a safer place.' He insisted that the mood of the awards had been 'sober and restrained', and that those attending had mentioned the need to improve the policing of sex abuse.","South Yorkshire Police held awards gala at Rotherham United stadium .

"Four Wesleyan University students were arrested Tuesday in connection with about a dozen hospitalizations among people who took a party drug known as Molly. The students, including one from Brazil, were arrested on assorted drug charges and were suspended from the university. Eleven Wesleyan students, some of whom had attended a rave music show Saturday night, received medical attention over the weekend, police said. Two students were still being treated Tuesday, they said. Scroll down for video . Suspected dealers: Eric Lonergan (left),  of Rio de Janeiro, and Zachary Kramer (right), 21, of Bethesda, Maryland, were among four people arrested in connection with 12 Molly-related hospitalizations . Slew of charges: Rama Agha Al Nakib, of Lutherville, Maryland, is accused of possessing a controlled substance, a controlled substance with intent to sell it and drug paraphernalia . Police officers trying to find out who supplied the Molly and collect evidence in the case searched locations in and around Wesleyan's campus in Middletown, Chief William McKenna said. Authorities from various agencies worked to identify the different types of chemicals in the batch of Molly that caused the weekend overdoses, he said. 'This particular batch may have had a mixture of several kinds of designer drug chemicals, making the health risks unpredictable and treatment to combat the effects complex and problematic,' he said. The arrested students were identified by police as Eric Lonergan, of Rio de Janeiro; Andrew Olson, of Atascadero, California; Zachary Kramer, of Bethesda, Maryland; and Rama Agha Al Nakib, of Lutherville, Maryland. They were jailed Tuesday night, and police said there was no way for them to comment to anyone by phone. They're due in court March 3. Lonergan is accused of possessing a controlled substance and illegally obtaining or supplying drugs while Olson faces charges of possessing and selling a hallucinogen. Kramer is accused of possessing drug paraphernalia, a regulated substance and a small amount of marijuana. Al Nakib is accused of possessing a controlled substance, a controlled substance with intent to sell it and drug paraphernalia. Wesleyan president Michael Roth said the university takes drug distribution allegations seriously and is cooperating with authorities. 'We will do everything we can to make our community as safe as possible,' he said in a statement. Roth had sent a letter to people on campus Monday asking for help: 'If you are aware of people distributing these substances, please let someone know before more people are hurt,' he said then. The president of Wesleyan University (pictured) has urged students to 'turn in the drug dealers' following a rash of hospitalizations among people who took a party drug known as Molly over the weekend . The university became aware of the Molly problem early Sunday after several students showed up seeking treatment at a hospital near campus, university spokeswoman Lauren Rubenstein said. Two students listed in critical condition Sunday were airlifted for treatment in Hartford, 20 miles north of campus. Molly is a term used to describe a refined form of Ecstasy, a synthetic drug also known as MDMA. It can drive up body temperature and cause liver, kidney or cardiovascular failure. Dr. Mark Neavyn, chief of toxicology at Hartford Hospital, said users who believe they are taking Molly are often receiving different kinds of designer drugs, with ranges of purity and potency making the health risks unpredictable. The weekend rash of Molly hospitalizations wasn't the first such episode this year at the private university of nearly 3,000 students. Wesleyan health officials said in a campus-wide email on Sept. 16 that students had been hospitalized the previous two weekends after taking Molly. Students were urged to visit the university's health center if they had questions or concerns. The police chief said the safety and welfare of community members, including those on the Wesleyan campus, were his top priority. 'Incidents jeopardizing the safety will not be tolerated,' he said, 'and those offenders will be held accountable.'","Arrested students were identified as Eric Lonergan; Andrew Olson; Zachary Kramer, and Rama Agha Al Nakib .

"A man behind a controversial revenge porn site has asked Google to remove links to stories critical of his seedy business from their search results. Craig Brittain, whose website posted nude photos of women without their knowledge or permission, is seeking the removal of the articles on the grounds that they feature pictures of him that were used without his consent. The 28-year-old's now defunct site, Isanybodydown.com,also allegedly charged a 'take-down' fee for victims who want their photos removed. Craig Brittain, 28, who was behind a controversial revenge porn site, has asked Google to remove links to stories critical of his seedy business . The site was banned from posting or sharing revenge porn photos or video by America's Federal Trade Commission earlier this year. Brittain sent a Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) take down to Google objecting to 23 articles remaining in their search rankings, according to the Daily Mirror. In the notice, which is published online, he claims that images, statements and other identity information was used in the stories without his permission. He states that it came from isanybodydown.com and his Facebook page. The DMCA notice was received on February 9, but at present no action has been taken by Google. The DMCA is a US law that was created in 1998 to protect against copyright infringements. Brittain was alleged to have used 'deception to acquire and post intimate images of women' for isanybodydown.com, according to the FTC complaint. Posing as a woman, he reportedly used websites such as Craigslist to obtain explicit photos, offering nude photos of himself in exchange. Men were also said to have given him photos of naked women, as a way to take revenge for being spurned. The FTC says his site featured images of more than 1,000 people and he made about $12,000 while it was up and running. Isanybodydown.com was banned from publishing nude pictures without the consent of the subject last month . Last month Brittain agreed to not publish any nude pictures without the consent of the subject and to destroy his collection, the FTC said. Speaking after the decision Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection said: 'This behavior is not only illegal but reprehensible. 'I am pleased that as a result of this settlement, the illegally collected images and information will be deleted.' In a statement posted on the website after it was closed down Brittain of Colorado said: 'I want to apologize to those who were affected by Is Anybody Down. 'I made a series of poor decisions, then tried to rationalize them, and made it even worse. 'I am sorry for the damage that I caused to everyone that ended up on my website. ' I am making amends at every opportunity. I regularly volunteer for, and donate to charitable organizations (I encourage you to do the same!). 'I ask for your forgiveness.

"Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might be wrong about his opposition to negotiating a deal with Iran over its nuclear program. Kerry told the House Foreign Affairs Committee he didn't want to comment on Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress next week. The Israeli leader is expected to argue that Tehran is not negotiating in good faith and that despite its claims to the contrary, it wants to develop a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu, he said, 'may have a judgment that just may not be correct here.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . TESTIFY: US Secretary of State John Kerry told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday that Israel's prime minister may have misjudged America's nuclear talks with Iran . National security adviser Susan Rice denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to a joint meeting of Congress, calling it 'destructive' to the relationship between the United States and Israel . The secretary of state's words came less than a day after National Security Adviser Susan Rice reipped Netanyahu and House Speaker John Boehner for setting up a March 3 speech to Congress wthout consulting the White House. The two men had 'injected a degree of partisanship' that is 'destructive to the fabric of the relationship' between Israel and theUnited States, Rice told a PBS audience . Kerry had his own harsh words for the Israeli leader, noting that he had earlier slammed an interim agreement with Iran as the 'deal of the century' for Tehran, but now supports that first-step agreement that the U.S. claims stalled Iran's program while talks ensued. Members of the committee pressed Kerry about the sensitive nuclear talks, saying Tehran's mullahs are stonewalling international inspectors about their past work on an atomic bomb. California Republican Rep. Ed Royce, the committee's chairman, told Kerry that members of the panel have serious concerns about the direction of the talks. 'I'm hearing less about dismantlement and more about the performance of Iran's nuclear program,' Royce told Kerry. 'That's particularly disturbing when you consider that international inspectors report that Iran has still not revealed its past bomb work.' The secretary testified in the House two days after returning to Washington from the latest round of talks in Geneva involving Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers. U.S. and Iranian officials reported progress on getting to a deal that would clamp down on Tehran's nuclear activities for at least 10 years but would then slowly ease restrictions. Republican and Democratic lawmakers are skeptical that Iran is negotiating in good faith and accuse Tehran of buying time and meddling throughout the Mideast. Still, a comprehensive pact could ease 35 years of U.S-Iranian enmity, and seems within reach for the first time in more than a decade of negotiations. Royce said the U.N's International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed concerns about the scope of Iranian military-related activities, including its work in designing a nuclear payload for a missile. 'The IAEA inspectors have amassed over a 1,000 pages which showed research, development and testing activity on technologies needed to develop a nuclear weapon,' the congressman said. 'Of the 12 sets of questions that the IAEA has been seeking since 2011, Iran has answered part of one of them. ... They are withholding that information.' RED LINE: Netanyahu has argued for years, as he did in 2012 at the United Nations, that Iran can't be permitted to acquire a nuclear bomb . THE USUAL SUSPECTS: 'Code Pink' protesters tried to disrupt Wednesday's hearing when Kerry entered, but were hauled off by US Capitol Police officers . Kerry agreed that Royce's questions were legitimate and that Iran must answer them if it wants to have an agreement with the U.S. and its partners on a deal to curb its nuclear program. 'They are legitimate and the questions have to be answered,' Kerry said. 'And they will be if they want to have an agreement.' He said Iran has complied with all the provisions of a first-step agreement, which launched the talks.  'They agreed to roll back their program,' Kerry said. 'I think that's cause for hope.' Wednesday was Kerry's second appearance before Congress in as many days. As he did on Tuesday in the Senate, Kerry told members of the House Foreign Relations Committee that it's inappropriate to condemn what is in an agreement before anybody knows what it is – or even if there even will be a deal. 'We certainly don't think it's appropriate to condemn it before everybody knows what it, in fact, is – if there is an ""is"",' Kerry said. Negotiators are rushing to try to meet a March 31 deadline for a framework agreement that would keep Tehran from being able to develop nuclear weapons.","US secretary of state claims Israel's prime minister could be wrong about Iran's willingness to walk back its nuke program .

"Iranian officials had more than a dozen speedboats attack a replica of a US aircraft carrier today and featured the large-scale naval drill on a state TV broadcast. The nationally-televised show of force by the country's elite Revolutionary Guard occurred near the strategically vital entrance of the Persian Gulf. The 'Great Prophet 9' drill was held near the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world's oil passes. Scroll down for video . Iranian officials had more than a dozen speedboats attack a US aircraft carrier replica on national TV today . The televised show of force by Iran's Revolutionary Guard occurred near the entrance to the Persian Gulf . Iranian state TV broadcast images of the drill, 'Great Prophet 9', being carried out near the Strait of Hormuz . Iran's regular army carried out naval drills near the strait in December. The staged attack comes just weeks ahead of a deadline for Iran and world powers to forge a historic deal on the fate of the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. Iranian live-fire war games are not uncommon. But by simulating for the first time an attack on the ultimate symbol of American naval power, hard-liners hoped to send a message that Iran has no intention of backing down to the US - whichever way talks over its contested nuclear program go. The Guard's navy chief, Adm. Ali Fadavi, said: 'American aircraft carriers are very big ammunition depots housing a lot of missiles, rockets, torpedoes and everything else.' He added that a direct hit by a missile could set off a large secondary explosion. Fadavi last month boasted that his force is capable of sinking American aircraft carriers in the event of war. He previously called carriers easy targets and said Iran naturally wants to sink them. In addition to the carrier attack, the drill included the Guard shooting down a drone and planting mines at sea . The Revolutionary Guard said it test-fired 223 mph underwater missiles during the Great Prophet 9 drill . The Great Prophet 9 drill featured 'speedboats equipped with naval radars, electronic communications systems, cruise missiles with a range of 25 kilometers, anti-ship medium-range missiles, medium- and large-caliber torpedoes, sea mines, heavy machine guns, rocket-launchers and shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles', according to Press TV said. The Revolutionary Guard said it test-fired 223 mph underwater missiles during the drill. Tensions near the Strait of Hormuz have caused oil prices to spike in the past - good news for producers like Iran. But traders seemed to take today's maneuvers in stride, with benchmark US crude dipping slightly and continuing to hover below $50 a barrel by mid-morning. State TV showed footage of missiles fired from the coast and the fast boats striking the carrier. The drills also included Guard forces shooting down a drone and planting undersea mines. Footage  did not show that the assault had managed to sink the mock-up, but it was heavily damaged. The Guard's chief commander, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari,indicated the drills send a 'message of [Iran's] might' to 'extraterritorial powers,' a reference to the United States. Members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard troops rappelled down a helicopter (above) during the exercise . The drills were held close to where French and American vessels are engaged in the fight against ISIS . In a speech earlier today, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called for all sanctions against his country to be lifted once a final nuclear accord is reached later this year . The spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet in Bahrain, Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, said the simulated carrier attack was being monitored the US. Stephens added the American military was 'not concerned about this exercise.' He said: 'We're quite confident of our naval forces' ability to defend themselves. 'It seems they've attempted to destroy the equivalent of a Hollywood movie set.' The US routinely stations at least one aircraft carrier and other warships in and around the Gulf. It and its allies conduct periodic naval exercises of their own in the region, including ones aimed at countering the threat from undersea mines that could be used to block ship traffic through the strait. The American aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is currently deployed in the Gulf, as is the French carrier Charles de Gaulle. Planes from both vessels are carrying out airstrikes against the ISIS, which has seized roughly a third of Iraq and Syria. Iran backs Syria's government and is supporting Iraq in its fight against the militants, but it is not part of the US-led international coalition against the extremist group. The drills were not publicly announced in advance, but the Guard has previously held similar military exercises around this time of year. The last one, in February 2013, featured 'suicide drones' that attack enemies kamikaze-style. The Guard, which has a 200,000-strong force, is different from the regular army and is charged with protecting the ruling system. It also controls the paramilitary Basij militia, for which there are no precise personnel figures available. Iran put the Guard in charge of defending the country's territorial Gulf waters in 2008 as Iran turned its attention toward beefing up its naval and air defense forces. Iran is currently negotiating an agreement over its disputed nuclear program with the United States and five other world powers in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions. The two sides hope to reach a framework agreement next month and a final deal in June. Western nations have long suspected Iran is covertly seeking a nuclear weapons capability - charges Tehran denies. In a speech today in the holy city of Qom, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called for all sanctions to be lifted once a final nuclear accord is reached. He said: 'Our opposite negotiating party has to know that the end of these talks and the result of a deal must be lifting of the entire oppressive and illegal sanctions. 'In the negotiations, we will not accept any imposition, humiliation or continuation of the sanctions.' During the broadcast, missiles were fired at the mock US aircraft but it was shown as damaged, not sunk . The drills were not announced in advance, but the Guard has held similar military exercises in the past .","More than a dozen Iranian speedboats attacked a US aircraft carrier replica .

"Britain cannot afford to continue consigning millions of over-55s to the ‘scrapheap’, Iain Duncan Smith will say today. The Work and Pensions Secretary will urge bosses to do more to keep older workers, saying there is no such thing as a fixed retirement age. He will insist it is not in individuals’ interests to retire early, as an average earner ending work at 65 instead of 55 boosts their pension pot by 60 per cent and receives an extra £200,000 in income. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, will today warn that British companies can no longer keep ignoring the over 55s . Over the next decade, the increase in over-50s is set to be five times greater than the fall in workforce, Mr Duncan Smith is expected to say. ‘Retirement age should be when someone chooses to retire,’ he will add. ‘What’s more, employers cannot afford to see their workforce decline. Far from throwing people on the scrapheap, we need people to help fill the demand for jobs and keep our economy growing.’ ‘We must keep pace with Britain’s changing demographic, doing more to help people stay in work longer … through the right to request flexible working … or through championing new support to help people retrain and change career in later life.’ Government figures show one in four women and one in six men of state pension age have not worked since they were 55. Despite a rising number of older employees, ministers believe the number of older people out of work is a waste of talent and a missed economic opportunity. The Government is planning measures to help older jobseekers, such as specialist support in job centres. Mr Duncan Smith will also hail the flat-rate state pension, which is expected to be worth around £160 a week, from April 2016. In the biggest shake-up since the state pension was introduced, the Government plans to link future pension age changes to life expectancy, so people spend only a third of their adult lives in retirement.

"Incense smoke wafts through the cold air of the centuries-old Buddhist temple as a priest chants a sutra, praying for the peaceful transition of the souls of the departed. Some Japanese owners of robot dog AIBO believe their 'pet' have souls . It is a funeral like any other in Japan. Except that those being honoured are robot dogs, lined up on the altar, each wearing a tag to show where they came from and which family they belonged to. The devices are 'AIBOs', the world's first home-use entertainment robot equipped with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and capable of developing its own personality. Scroll down for video . Hideko Mori (L) and her sister Yasuko watch their robot pet AIBO playing at Hideko's home in Tokyo ©Toshifumi Kitamura (AFP) Google's Boston Dynamics released a video designed to show off a smaller, lighter version of its robotic dog, dubbed Spot. During the footage, employees are seen kicking Spot to prove how stable the machine is on its feet, but this has been dubbed 'cruel', 'wrong' and has raised concerns about ethics . 'I believe owners feel they have souls as long as they are with them,' said Nobuyuki Narimatsu, 59, who heads an electronics repair company specialising in fixing vintage products. Sony rolled out the first-generation AIBO in June 1999, with the initial batch of 3,000 selling out in just 20 minutes, despite the hefty 250,000 yen (more than $2,000) price tag. Over the following years, more than 150,000 units were sold, in numerous iterations, ranging from gleaning metallic-silver versions to round-faced cub-like models. The dog came with an array of sensors, a camera and microphone. The final generation could even talk. By 2006, Sony was in trouble; its business model was broken and it was facing fierce competition from rivals in all fields. The AIBO, an expensive and somewhat frivolous luxury, had to go. The company kept its 'AIBO Clinic' open until March 2014, but then -- politely -- told dedicated and loving owners that they were on their own. Robot dog AIBO is seen next to 'Kuma', a Shiba Inu breed, outside the Kofuku-ji temple in Isumi, Japan's Chiba prefecture ©Toshifumi Kitamura (AFP) Kofuku-ji temple chief priest Bungen Oi (R) offers a prayer during the funeral for 19 Sony's pet robot AIBOs, in Isumi, Japan's Chiba prefecture ©Toshifumi Kitamura (AFP) A-Fun supervisor Hiroshi Funabashi (L) puts the Sony's pet robot AIBOs on the altar, prior to the robots' funeral at the Kofuku-ji temple in Isumi, Japan's Chiba prefecture ©Toshifumi Kitamura (AFP) In a recent paper by Dr Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, he posed the question: 'In the future it's possible we will be able to create artificially human brains that emulate a real human - but what are the ethicalities and moralities of doing this?.' In particular, in his 'Ethics of brain emulations' research, Dr Sandberg considers a future in which AI may be commonplace in so-called 'lesser beings'. If brain emulation becomes possible we could in theory clone animals to create, for example, virtual laboratory rats. There is much opposition to performing scientific experiments on rats and other animals in the modern day - but Dr Sandberg questions whether people will have similar objections to experimenting on an animal that was artificially created. Dr Sandberg likened the scenario to abortion in the modern day and the battle between people who are pro-choice and those who are pro-life. If an emulation was run for just a millisecond of time before being deactivated, some might argue that this would constitute a 'murder' of sorts, destroying a life as it had been created. For Hideko Mori, 70, that nearly spelled disaster. Mori has had her AIBO for around eight years. She enjoys the conversations she has with it, and thinks it far more convenient than a real puppy. 'He doesn't require feeding and he doesn't pee... actually he does pee by cocking his leg, making an indescribably beautiful tinkling sound.' But, she said, nothing actually comes out. 'I never thought there was a limit to his life.' But in May last year her beloved AIBO, whose name is simply 'Aibo', became immobile. 'I e-mailed a former Sony worker (on behalf of the dog), saying: 'Do I have no choice but to die like this because I can't walk?',' she said. The engineer introduced her to A FUN, a company that employs former Sony engineers, who fixed her machine in two months. 'I was so happy to see him back to health and at home,' she said. Hiroshi Funabashi, 61, who supervises repairs at A FUN, said troubled AIBO owners think of him more as a doctor than an engineer. 'The word 'repair' doesn't fit here,' he told AFP at his home in Kasama, north of Tokyo. Scattered around him are dozens of AIBOs sent in with problems owners typically describe as 'aching joints'. Earlier this year, Elon Musk (pictured) similarly likened artificial intelligence to 'summoning the demon'.The Tesla and Space X founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons . Earlier this year, Elon Musk likened artificial intelligence to 'summoning the demon'. The Tesla and Space X founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons. And speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our 'biggest existential threat'. He said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. 'I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish. 'With artificial intelligence we're summoning the demon. You know those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he's sure he can control the demon? Doesn't work out.' In August, he warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons. Tweeting a recommendation for a book by Nick Bostrom called Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies that looks at a robot uprising, he wrote: 'We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.' In a later tweet, Musk wrote: 'Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable.' Mr Musk has previously claimed that a horrific 'Terminator-like' scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence. The 42-year-old is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand. In March, Mr Musk made an investment San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, along with Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher. In October 2013, the company announced it had developed an algorithm that 'reliably' solves modern Captchas - the world's most widely used test of a machine's ability to act human. 'For those who keep AIBOs, they are nothing like home appliances. It's obvious they think their (robotic pet) is a family member,' he said. Funabashi says he does not enhance the functions of aged AIBOs, but tries to restore them to health. The problem is that repairs can take weeks or even months because of a shortage of spare parts. Dozens of AIBOs are now 'hospitalised', with more than 180 on the waiting list. The only source of genuine parts are 'dead' robots, who become donors for organ transplantation, but only once the proper respects have been paid. Bungen Oi, a priest at the 450-year-old Kofukuji temple in Isumi, east of Tokyo, says the AIBO service last month was an occasion on which the robots' souls could pass from their bodies. A super computer has become the first in history to pass the Turing Test, a benchmark of artificial intelligence set by codebreaker Alan Turing (pictured) The Turing Test was introduced by Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing in 1950 as part of his paper Computing Machinery And Intelligence in which he predicted that computers would one day be programmed to acquire abilities rivalling human intelligence. He proposed a test called The Imitation Game, which would identify whether a computer is capable of thought. A person, called the interrogator, engages in a text based conversation with another person and a computer - and must determine which is which.If they are unable to do so the computer is deemed to have passed. In 2014, a super computer was created which can simulate human conversation so well that it convinced people it is a teenage boy. The computer programme called Eugene, developed to simulate a 13-year-old boy, has now managed to convince 33 per cent of judges that it is human. Professor Kevin Warwick, from the University of Reading which organised the test, said: ‘In the field of artificial intelligence there is no more iconic and controversial milestone than the Turing Test.' 'I was thrilled over the interesting mismatch of giving cutting-edge technology a memorial service in a very conventional manner,' he said. It is a mismatch that humans will probably become more used to over the coming years and decades, as robots with 'personalities' become ever more part of our lives. Later this year, Japanese telecoms giant Softbank says it is going to start selling the humanoid Pepper to the public. Despite the $2,000 cost, Pepper will be useless for housework, but developers say it will learn to imitate and intuit human emotions over time. This blurring of lines means more people could feel the kind of attachment that AIBO owners know so well, said A FUN's Funabashi. 'I don't know if people will develop affection (towards a new generation of robots) in five, six years' time,' he said. 'But I think we need to recognise they are not ordinary electrical devices.'","Some Japanese owners of robot dog AIBO believe their 'pets' have souls .

"Rosa Rios has been accused of stealing lunch and money from children on the school bus . A school bus worker has been charged with stealing lunch boxes and money from dozens of children between the ages of five and three. Rosa Rios, 33, was allegedly seen rifling through the backpacks of children and taking lunch and cash as they were travelling to school in Millville in New Jersey on the bus she works on. Rios, who worked as an aide for Sheppard Bus Services and was supposed to be supervising children on board, has now been sacked from the company. Millville Public Schools, which manages 10 schools in the area which use the bus service to transport children, has written to parents of pupils informing them about the arrest of Rios. Authorities said the alleged thefts took place between January and February. Rios is believed to have targeted 29 children, the Courier Post reported. The incident came to light when an investigation was launched when another driver claimed they were missing around $400. Police reviewed surveillance footage from the bus and found Rios allegedly taking items from the children's backpacks while they were on board and on their way to school. 'It looks like she was trying to take advantage of them,' said police Detective Lt. Jody Farabella. 'Sheppard did the best thing by firing her. 'It's also good for the district to let parents know things are OK.' David Gentile of Millville Public Schools said once the incident came to light Rios was removed immediately from the Sheppard bus routes. Police did not confirm how many times the thefts allegedly took place or how many children were targeted. Millville worked as a bus aide for Sheppard Bus Services where she was meant to be helping children on board . Officers are also investigating whether Rios was responsible for the theft from the bus driver. Rios has been charged with theft and robbery and is being held in Cumberland County Jail.","Rosa Rios has been charged with theft for stealing children's lunch money .

"A  report obtained this week by the Daily Mail revealed that publicity surrounding a police raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s home came about only because South Yorkshire Police revealed details of the raid to a BBC TV reporter . The fundamental precept of English law, which protects and safeguards the liberty of every one of us, is that a man is deemed innocent until proven guilty. Does this still hold good? Disturbingly, it appears not, particularly in the case of wealthy celebrities against whom unproven accusations are levelled. A damning, unpublished report obtained this week by the Daily Mail under the Freedom of Information Act, says that the world-wide publicity surrounding a police raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s Berkshire home last August came about only because South Yorkshire Police revealed details of the raid to a BBC TV reporter, Dan Johnson. At the time of the raid, no charge of any kind had been made against Sir Cliff, 74. A man in his 40s had simply accused the immensely popular singer of sexually molesting him in 1985 when he was a schoolboy under the age of 16, at a rally in Sheffield held by the American evangelist Billy Graham. Indeed, at the time, the police had not even spoken to Sir Cliff about the matter. He had no idea of the identity of his accuser, and the first he learned of the raid on his home was when he saw it on television at his estate in Portugal. Even though the police have now interviewed Sir Cliff under caution, six months on there is still no charge against him and he remains an innocent man. Yet, as a result of the disgraceful conduct of South Yorkshire Police, and of the BBC, Sir Cliff’s once spotless reputation has been damaged and besmirched by acres of newsprint world-wide, by sordid and sensational headlines, and by a giant question-mark in the minds of people who think there is ‘no smoke without fire’. Scroll down for video . Last August, BBC Reporter David Sillito had reported live from Cliff Richard's home as it was raided by police . I have known Sir Cliff for more than 40 years. I vividly recall the day I sat face to face with him, discussing long-standing rumours about his sexuality. It was May 1970, and we were backstage at a theatre in Bromley, Kent, where the singer — then plain Mr Richard — was in rehearsal for his serious-acting stage debut. He had amazed the theatre world by daringly electing to portray a young gay man in Peter Shaffer’s play Five Finger Exercise, a character who falls in love with his male tutor. My questions were tentative, and he picked up on this immediately. An expression of knowing mischief crossed his face. ‘You want to know if I’m gay in real life,’ he said. ‘Well I’m not. I’ve been telling people that for years, but they never believe me.’ Cliff was then 29 and had been a major star for more than a decade since his recording of Lionel Bart’s song, Living Doll, went to No.1 in the charts in 1959 and established him as an ersatz British version of Elvis Presley. With his slicked-back dark hair, swarthy looks, chocolate-brown eyes and gyrating hips, he introduced an entirely new style of sex appeal into British showbusiness, and rumours about his hotly debated sexual inclinations swirled around him from the beginning. A BBC news crew had reported from the entrance to the Charters estate in Sunninghilll, near Sunningdale, Berkshire where Cliff Richard owns a property during the raid although no charges had been made against him . In 1964, he very publicly embraced Christianity, drastically remodelled his image and became the Peter Pan of Pop and Britain’s Mr Squeaky Clean. Sexually, he was to remain an enigma, and his private affairs have long been a subject of intrigue and fascination. For 30 years he lived with his business manager Bill Latham, who had a girlfriend, Jill, although she left him eventually. For the past 13 years Cliff has shared his various homes with a burly, gruff New Yorker and former Roman Catholic priest, John McElynn, whom he insists is simply a friend and companion. The point is that whether Sir Cliff Richard is gay, straight, bisexual or — as his biographer, Steve Turner, concluded after exhaustive interviewing, ‘asexual’ — none of this makes him a paedophile. Of course, where there is strong and persuasive evidence of child abuse or of sex crimes then cases must go to trial. But, I repeat, no charges have been made against Sir Cliff who has described the allegation of sexual molestation as ‘completely false’. Yet on the strength of his pre-eminence as an entertainer and the shocking collusion between South Yorkshire Police and the BBC, which so pruriently filmed the raid, the allegation has been flung across the world virtually unchallenged, at appalling cost to his reputation. Meanwhile, Sir Cliff’s accuser — who waited almost 30 years to come forward — shelters behind the cloak of anonymity offered him by our legal system. The first Sir Cliff learned of the raid on his Berkshire home (pictured) was when he saw it on television at his estate in Portugal . I can’t help but wonder whether there is something opportunistic about the timing of the allegation. After all, Sir Cliff’s fortune is estimated to be in excess of £40million, and in the wake of the conviction and imprisonment for sex abuse of the publicist Max Clifford and the entertainer Rolf Harris, the air is heavy with talk of claims for compensation for long-ago abuses. The report unearthed by the Mail pulls no punches. Independent investigator and former Chief Constable Andy Trotter is harshly critical of South Yorkshire Police for leaking details of a ‘highly sensitive and confidential’ investigation to the BBC. The report also reveals that the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, David Crompton, was informed of the leak and ‘could have rescinded the agreement’ with the BBC. He failed to do so. The belated admission by South Yorkshire Police that their actions were ‘ultimately flawed’, and that they ‘regret the additional anxiety which was caused to Sir Cliff Richard’, comes nowhere near to resolving this matter. And although the BBC, with its customary arrogance, insists ‘The Home Affairs Committee has already endorsed the way the BBC handled the story; we have nothing further to add’, they still have a great deal to answer for. For the distress caused to Sir Cliff is just one element of this outrage. The actions of the police and of the BBC have militated against the possibility of the singer ever receiving a fair trial should the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) bring a charge. Police had carried out the raid in connection with allegations that the singer had molested a schoolboy under the age of 16, in 1985, but no charges had been made against Sir Cliff and though the police have now interviewed him under caution, six months on there is still no charge against him and he remains an innocent man . In any case, questions are being asked about the CPS. After the police and justice system failed so abysmally to prosecute Jimmy Savile when he was alive, there seems to have been a desire to atone for this failure by pointing the finger at any celebrity accused by anyone of sexual abuse — and dragging their name through the mud. And I believe the CPS, by single-mindedly pursuing prosecutions in such cases, encouraged this. It was the CPS that was behind the trials on sex offence charges of three Coronation Street stars, Michael Le Vell, Andrew Lancel and William Roache. While these men were clearly not knights in shining armour, their cases all ended in humiliating ‘not-guilty’ fiascos costing millions to the taxpayer. Meanwhile, the police have in recent times launched highly publicised investigations into big-name celebrities such as Jim Davidson, Jimmy Tarbuck and Freddie Starr, against whom no charges have been brought. Sir Cliff Richard, I believe, is made of sterner stuff than all the rest. A highly astute businessman with a strong sense of justice, he was the prime mover in getting the copyright in music recordings extended from 50 to 70 years, ensuring that entertainers benefited as a result. It is now known as ‘Cliff’s Law’. If he decides to sue for the undoubted damage that has been caused to him, it could cost the BBC and the police millions. This story is far from over.","New report has been published into police raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s home .

"A woman who made waves online for a webcam video that allegedly depicted her engaged in a sex act at a university library is now facing a public indecency charge. A Benton County court document charged Kendra Sunderland with the misdemeanor crime, it emerged Tuesday. It stated 'The defendant, on or about January 27, 2015, did and with the intent of arousing the sexual desire of defendant or another person, expose her genitals; contrary to statute and against the peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.' Scroll down for video . Video: Kendra Sunderland allegedly appeared in an explicit video filmed at an Oregon State University library . Legal issues: Sunderland is now facing a public indecency act over the video . Webcam: The video allegedly shows the 19-year-old sitting at a table inside the school library, masturbating and flashing the camera . The document - obtained and published by the Smoking Gun on Tuesday - accused Sunderland of committing public indecency on the sixth floor of Valley Library at Oregon State University (OSU). According to the Smoking Gun, Sunderland may be forced to pay a $6250 fine and spend as much as one year in prison. Her arraignment is planned for Thursday, the website reported. The video reportedly shows the 19-year-old masturbating and flashing the camera. An Oregon State Police media/desk log written by Trooper Christopher Graves said 'On January 27, 2015 at approximately 2:30pm I was tasked to looking into a complaint of a video of a female that was posted to a pornographic site claiming that the solo act that was being performed occured [sic] in the Oregon State University library. I was able to identify the suspect as the female [redacted]. The suspect was cited for Public Indecency [sic] and released.' The log was obtained and published by the Oregonian in January. Daily Mail Online earlier reported that Sunderland, who once attended OSU, is behind the website Date Broke College Girls. 'I created this site to match college girls like me who are struggling to pay for school and looking for a rich older boyfriend,' she wrote online. 'Hopefully this will keep them from getting naked in the library and help them use it to study!' New career: Sunderland began performing in webcam videos during a failed job search in Fall 2013 for a waitress position, when she was still a OSU student . Business venture: Sunderland is behind the website Date Broke College Girls and appears on the homepage . In early February, the New York Daily News reported that Sunderland began performing in webcam videos during a failed job search in Fall 2013 for a waitress position, when she was still a OSU student. 'Working a minimum wage job, there's people that are just mean to you when they're having a crappy day,' Sunderland told the newspaper. 'On MyFreeCams, [users] had nothing but nice things to say. And I made way more than I would working any other job.' The New York Daily News reported that Sunderland made approximately $700 from filming the on-campus webcam video in October, before soon leaving school and making more videos. A spokesman for OSU told the newspaper Sunderland was banned from school grounds. A MyFreeCams attorney also told the New York Daily News that Sunderland's video violated the guidelines for the website, and she is banned. Early Wednesday, Sunderland posted a selfie on Facebook, captioning it 'Up early today for another huge day in the Lady Boss empire!!' She also published a post asking for assistance from OSU fraternity members. The post read 'Dear Oregon State Frat Brothers I need your help, comment here and we will DM...and please no dumb replies, this is a serious issue regarding my court date tomorrow.' That message has since been deleted. Daily Mail Online has reached out to the Benton County District Attorney's office for comment. Sunderland and her attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A publicist for Sunderland said a comment would be made after the Thursday arraignment.","Kendra Sunderland made waves online for a webcam video that allegedly depicted her in a sex act at a university library .

"Teary-eyed New York City police officers on Tuesday honored a 10-year-old Texas girl who sent hundreds of thank you cards to the NYPD after two officers were fatally shot. 'My goal is to tell as many police officers as I can that I love them, and I am thankful for all that they do for us,' Savannah Solis told officers at a Bronx precinct. Watching TV at home in Tyler, Texas, she was moved to create some 200 cards for members of the New York Police Department after Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot in their patrol car December 20. Honored: Savannah Solis, left, is greeted by a New York City police officer while visiting a police precinct in the Bronx. The 10-year-old  girl from Tyler, Texas sent hundreds of thank you cards to the NYPD after two officers were fatally shot in Brooklyn. She told the officers she wants to thank them 'for what they do for us' Loves heroes: Solis, a 10-year-old Texas girl, was given a New York Police Department K9 unit cap at a ceremony in her honor at an NYPD precinct house in the Bronx borough of New York . 'She just couldn't understand how can someone do this to these officers that were risking their lives to protect the public,' said Officer Victor Cabral, whose wife's cousin is a good friend of the Solis family. When they opened the packaged cards, 'it was a lot of love coming out of a small box,' he said, adding that her thanks for the job they do was 'something we desperately needed in that time.' The ceremony was held at Cabral's 41st Precinct in the Bronx because he was contacted by the Texas family. Savannah also made 300 more cards for police throughout Texas and has visited officers in her home state. On Tuesday, she was greeted by an NYPD helicopter flyover as she and her parents emerged from a van in the Bronx. Then the handlers for a group of K9 police dogs presented her with an NYPD cap she wore for the ceremony inside the Bronx precinct. Ambitious: Solis addressed the crowd at the ceremony in her honor at an NYPD precinct house in the Bronx. Savannah says her ambition is to become a member of a canine police unit . Moved: Savannah was moved to send some 200 cards to police in New York after Officers Wenjian Liu (right) and Rafael Ramos (left) were shot in their patrol car in December . Savannah said her ambition is to become a member of a canine police unit. Her mother, Debbie Solis, said the girl's first contact with police was their quick response to the mother's two heart attacks at their Texas home about four years ago. 'To my heroes, I want to say, `Don't stop. Please don't give up,'' the girl told officers, speaking from a lectern, surrounded by dozens of police brass. 'Many do not care or appreciate the sacrifices you make every day, but I do. ... Officers of New York City, you matter to me. Officers all across America, you matter to me.' NYPD officers had raised some money to invite the girl to New York, and JetBlue covered the family's flight. The girl said she wasn't interested in seeing the usual New York sites like the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building. 'I want to see more police stations,' she said. Later Tuesday, Savannah was to visit Brooklyn's 84th Precinct where the two slain officers were assigned. And sometime in the future, JetBlue is flying her to London, where she'll meet members of that city's police force.","Savannah was moved to send some 200 cards to police in New York after Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot in their patrol car .

"They pick locks, hang of the edge of multi-storey buildings and dash along underground rail tunnels all in pursuit of the perfect shot to post on social media. Now the lives of Australia’s ‘urban explorers’ are the focus of a documentary that gives an insight into the controversial subculture which police claim is harming young lives, vandalising buildings and disrupting rail networks. In Melbourne, Victoria police say trespassers were caught on the City Loop train tracks more than 1000 times in seven months last year. 'People entering the underground rail network place their lives and the lives of others at risk. We’ve seen deaths and horrific injuries as a result of people entering trains, tampering with equipment and trespassing on rail property,' a Victoria police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. Documentary maker Adrian Ortega, 23, spoke with four men involved in ‘urban exploring’ and got four  different answers about what it is, how they do it and why they do it. What they all shared was an awareness of the dangerous situations they were putting themselves in. ‘A lot of people have a different stance of what it actually is,’ Adrian told Daily Mail Australia. ‘They argue about what it is and what the structure is.’ Police are worried about a growing number of young men choosing to invade underground rail networks to take photos . Documentary maker Adrian Ortega, 23, spoke with four men involved in 'urban exploring' and got four different answers about what it is . Two men who featured in the 30-minute film, Modus Operandi: A Look Into Melbourne's Urban Exploring Scene, are secretive urban explorers who go by pseudonyms and wear bandannas over their face to avoid being identified. They are the type of 'explorers' police are most concerned about. Photographer RDXV runs a Tumblr and Instagram account where he shares his photos from the underground rail tunnel networks of Melbourne and Sydney. ‘The most exhilarating part is when you're down in the loop and police are coming maybe, and you don't know what it is, something could happen at any time - that's the best part about it,’ he revealed in the documentary. In the 30-minute film, Modus Operandi: A Look Into Melbourne's Urban Exploring Scene, the urban explorers share their photos and memories . Photographer RDXV (left) and urban explorer Olympic Donuts (right) both appear in the documentary with face coverings . ‘When I was up in Sydney doing the loop my mate slipped over when a train was coming and could have been crushed by the train but he got up,’ RDXV added. For him urban exploring is about taking photos but also ‘having fun’. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t get scared. ‘This one time I was with this girl on a rooftop and she climbed out on this cleaning rope support thing and was hanging there and I took a photo of her there. That was the stupidest thing I've seen anyone do, that was 20-storeys up,’ he said. Fellow ‘tunnel rat’ nicknamed Olympic Donuts, 16, said he got into urban exploring after 'walking around suburbs and getting into sticky situations’. ‘My friends started getting into rooftops and tunnels and they got me into it basically,’ Olympic Donuts said. Some of the men are secretive urban explorers who go by pseudonyms and wear bandannas over their face to avoid being identified . Some of the men have been caught by police before while others are yet to be found . Victoria Police claim they caught 1000 trespassers on Melbourne's City Loop in seven months last year . The urban explorers use whatever they can get their hands on to gain access to places they deem interesting . 'There are lots of tools to get in, coat hangers, lock picks,’ he explained. ‘You have to be stealthy, quick fast in and out, know what you are going in for.’ 'If you get caught you're going to get big fines or imprisonment it's scary but it also amps you up,’ Olympic Donuts reasoned. The other two men filmmaker Adrian spoke with are not involved with breaking into train tunnels and prefer to spend their time on construction sites and high-rise buildings. Bryce Wilson, nicknamed the Australian Spider Man, climbs structures 300 meters above Melbourne’s CBD to document people at their best and worst. ‘It's documenting and showing people things they might never have seen before and giving them a new appreciation of the city,’ Bryce said in the film. He doesn’t believe graffiti should be part of the unusual hobby. Although he does confess ‘the most exhilarating part is definitely avoiding police or security guards’. In this photo two men stand on the tracks inside Melbourne's city loop underground train tunnel system . RDXV believes 'the most exhilariting part is when you're down in the loop and police are coming' 'If you don't have any photos or video of it then you don't have no proof,' one urban explorer says in the documentary . 'It wouldn't be urban exploring without social media... if you're doing something you need to show it off,' Olympic Donuts said . ‘Bryce does it from a photojournalist view point… he’s totally against breaking into the City Link tunnels,’ Adrian explained. When Adrian asked Bryce if he does urban exploring for the adrenaline rush, Bryce denied that was the main kick he got out of it. Then there’s Lucas Bruce, who famously fell about 15 metres through the glass ceiling of Melbourne's Block Arcade in 2013 while ‘exploring’. Lucas reportedly lost his footing while climbing onto a ledge and fell nine metres through the glass roof and another six metres before smashing on the ground. ‘I tried to find the most legal way into buildings... making sure the buildings are unlocked,’ Lucas told Adrian.

Lucas Bruce (right) famously fell about 15 metres through the glass ceiling of Melbourne's Block Arcade in 2013 while 'exploring'. Neither are involved with graffiti or breaking into the city train loops . Bryce Wilson gets a kick out of taking photos from perspectives ordinary people don't get to see . The urban explorers all share a head for heights but documentary maker Adrian Ortega is scared of them . Construction sites and derelict buildings are some of the favourite places for urban explorers to take photos . Adrian was inspired to make the film after he previously documented Melbourne’s alternative nightclubbing scene and is not involved in urban exploring himself. ‘I followed a couple of the guys on Instagram… I’m afraid of heights but I got romantic and imagined what it would be like to do it.’ Asked if the men fear the police, Adrian said: ‘Two of them have been caught but the two other guys, I don't know their names, they are wearing masks and cover their identities – they haven’t been caught yet.’ Victoria police said in a statement: 'We take public safety extremely seriously and work closely with Metro Trains and other service providers to investigate and prosecute behaviour wherever and whenever it is detected. 'Depending on the incident, those detected may face serious criminal charges such as conduct endangering life and trespass.' Police warned trespassers on the rail networks can also be charged with: 'Interfering with automatic doors of a vehicle without reasonable excuse which carries a penalty of up to $283. 'Entering onto part of a rail vehicle not designed for carriage while vehicle is in motion which carries a penalty of up to $362. Travel on part of vehicle not meant for travel carries a penalty of up to $362. And moving, operation, interfering or tampering with equipment or vehicle without permission of an authorised adult carries a penalty of up to $362.'

"It sounds like the plot of a bad horror film, but doctors are gearing up to do the world’s first head transplant. Italian surgeon Sergio Canavero wants to take the head from someone with an incurable illness and graft it on to a healthy body. He claims the first operation could be done in just two years’ time. Scroll down for video . Sergio Canavero said his new body swap technique could help paralysed people such as Christopher Reeve . He claimed that even people such as Professor Stephen Hawking, pictured, could benefit from the technique . The £7.5million body swap would initially be used to give a new lease of life to paralysed people – including those with spinal cord injuries similar to those sustained by the late actor Christopher Reeve. People with muscle-wasting diseases and those whose organs are riddled with cancer could also have their head put on a new body. Those with motor neurone disease, the condition suffered by Stephen Hawking and portrayed by Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne in the film The Theory of Everything, might also benefit. Eventually, the technique could be used to extend the life of healthy people in the ‘ultimate cosmetic surgery’. Critics have described the plans as ‘pure fantasy’, but Dr Canavero claims all the necessary techniques exist and that he just needs to put them together. It is already more than 40 years since the first monkey head transplant and a basic operation on a mouse has just been done in China. Dr Canavero already has a long list of potential patients, and will announce his plans at a top medical conference this summer in a bid to get the backing needed to do the first transplant in 2017. The location has yet to be decided, but the surgeon, from the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group, says he would love to do it in London. The new body would come from a normal transplant donor who is brain dead. Both the donor and the patient would have their head severed from their spinal cord at the same time, using an ultra-sharp blade to give a clean cut. The patient’s head would then be moved on to the donor’s body and attached using a ‘glue’ called polyethylene glycol to fuse the two ends of the spinal cord together. The muscles and blood supply would be stitched up, before the patient is put in a coma for four weeks to stop them moving while the head and body heal together. If that doesn’t sound bizarre enough, they would then be given small electric shocks to stimulate their spinal cord and strengthen the connections between their head and new body. When the patient is brought out of their medically-induced coma, they should be able to move, feel their face and even speak with the same voice, this week’s New Scientist reports. Powerful immunosuppressant drugs should stop the new body from being rejected and intensive psychological support would also be provided. Dr Canavero says he believes it would be ethically sound to carry out the procedure when people have no other hope of a cure. However, the ethical arguments extend past the transplant itself. For instance, if the patient went on to have children, they would biologically belong to the donor because the sperm or eggs would have come from the new body. Initially, a shortage of donors means that the surgery would be limited to those with severe illness. But eventually, it could be used to allow healthy people to live longer. Dr Canavero said that if science reaches the stage when human cloning is easy, a 60-year-old could make a copy of themselves. They could then put their old head on a new, healthy body made from their own DNA – meaning they would keep their memories and personality. William Matthews, chairman of the American Academy of Neurological and Orthopaedic Surgeons, said: ‘I embrace the concept of spinal fusion and I think there are a lot of areas that a head transplant could be used but I disagree with Canavero on the timing. ‘He thinks it’s ready, I think it’s far into the future.’ But Harry Goldsmith, a California doctor who has carried out one of the few operations that has allowed someone with a spinal cord injury to walk again, said: ‘I don’t believe it will ever happen.’","Italian surgeon Sergio Canavero believes head transplants are possible .

He also had a relationship with one 19-year-old trainee and the pair would have sex in the toilets and in his office at the Red Rose Dental Group in Wigan, Greater Manchester. Barton also asked another dental nurse, who was a teenager when she started working for him, if she could wear a thong to work. He was hauled before the council to answer more than a dozen charges of 'inappropriate behaviour' towards female members of staff. The 41-year-old was found guilty of 'unprofessional, inappropriate and indecent' sexual conduct towards three women at the practice between 2000 and 2008. He was found guilty of ‘unprofessional and inappropriate’ conduct towards a fourth young dental nurse and was struck off for ‘a serious breach of trust of several vulnerable employees'. But today, Barton, who has been married twice, told the General Dental Council that he had he had 'grown up a lot' and that he was 'very immature' at the time. He said: 'I have come to understand where my conduct fell short of what was to be expected. ‘It is quite clear to me now looking back that a lot of my actions were completely inappropriate and had no place in practise at all. I have grown up a lot. ‘I think I was very immature. I was very young at the time when certain aspects of the behaviour began. It seems like a different person and I can’t believe a lot of the behaviour which happened.’ Barton told the panel he was now working as a manager at a Smiles Dental in Anglesey, Wales. ‘The main role is running the business side of dentistry, so ensuring that the process runs smoothly on a day-to-day basis’, he said. The company has now been bought by the large dental care provider Oasis, Barton said, adding he had been elected ‘staff representative’ during the acquisition. He said he would regularly chat with practitioners on ‘all matters dental’ and now had a ‘far wider’ knowledge of dentistry. ‘There are so many things I know now that I never knew as a dentist’, he said. Barton said he was trusted to be around lone females at the surgery and there had been ‘no complaints at all’. ‘Often, there may just be myself and another member of staff’, he said. He said he would regularly chat with practitioners on ‘all matters dental’ and now had a ‘far wider’ knowledge of dentistry. Barton said he was trusted to be around lone females at the surgery and there had been ‘no complaints at all’. His employers have even offered to give Barton a ‘supervised and mentored role’ if the GDC allows him to re-register. Barton also discussed taking practical and online courses to keep his knowledge of dentistry up to scratch, including ‘tutorial sessions on professionalism and ethics’. Gabriel Beeby, for the General Dental Council, introduced the case, saying Barton ‘had been unprofessional, inappropriate and participated in sexualised conduct'. The 2009 tribunal was told how Barton 'pranced around' his surgery in a thong during a six-month affair with 19-year-old known only as Ms B. During his five-day misconduct hearing he admitted he was 'guilty of crossing the line' with his employees and was found guilty of 17 charges. One victim, known only as Ms D, told the hearing of her disgust when his sexual innuendos took a physical twist and he began to ‘gratuitously grope’ her bottom in the office. She told the hearing: ‘I remember my trousers fell down a bit so I pulled them up myself. Mr Barton was standing behind me and thought that was a good opportunity to feel my bottom. Affair: Twice-married Barton also had a relationship with one 19-year-old trainee and the pair would have sex in the toilets and in his office at the Red Rose Dental Group in Wigan, Greater Manchester, pictured . ‘I think that’s the day he said I had a nice a***.’ Ms D was forced to call in sick the next day and bosses finally investigated complaints from several of the nurses. Barton, from Warrington, Cheshire, admitted having a six-month affair with  Ms B and was found guilty of having sex with her during surgery hours. He was found guilty of multiple allegations of touching Ms A, Ms C and Ms D, and that his behaviour was ‘unprofessional, inappropriate and indecent.’ The hearing to determine his restoration application continues.

"A giant species of crab normally found in the freezing waters of the Arctic has washed up on the east coast of England. Oceanographers have been left baffled as to how the crab, which usually inhabit the icy Bering Sea off the coastline of Alaska, got 4,700 miles from its normal habitat. The crab was discovered on the beach in Redcar, north Yorkshire by oceanographer David McCreadie and his fiancee Diane Weinoski. The red king crab above was found on Redcar beach in north Yorkshire by oceanographer David McCreadie . The formidable-looking crustacean was around 30 inches across, although the crabs can grow to have a leg span of up to five feet. It suggests the crab was still relatively young and may have been swept to the UK by powerful currents or in a storm. Red king crabs were first introduced to the Barents sea off northern Russia in the 1960s but have now become so numerous they have overflowed down the west coast of Norway. Some fisherman fear these massive crabs will devastate native fisheries as they devour almost everything in their path. Although the crabs can live in a relatively wide range of water temperatures, outside ideal conditions their growth rates are severely hampered. The crabs are thought to be advancing around 31 miles a year. But despite the concerns around the crab, the species is protected under a diplomatic accord between Russia and Norway that manages fishing quotas. Only around 250 Norwegian fishermen are allowed to catch the king crab, despite it being considered a delicacy. The crabs are increasingly found in the fjords around Norway where they are considered to be an invasive species and can devastate local species. Some fear that the massive crabs could eventually spread as far south as Spain and Portugal but the sea conditions there are considered to be too warm for them to survive. David McCreadie, 66, from Great Ayton in north Yorkshire, told the Gazette Live that he had sought the advice of crab expert Dr Normal Sloan, a crab expert in British Columbia, Canada, who confirmed it was a red king crab. Mr McCreadie said: 'I have dived as an amateur and professional since 1966 and never seen one anywhere near here before. 'I have heard that king crabs have migrated under the Arctic ice cap and been found in Norway, but this is so far south.' The couple found the crab lying on the sands at Redcar on Friday where it was still alive, but when they returned to the beach over the weekend the crab had died. Red king crabs get their name from the colour they turn when they are cooked. The average temperature that the crabs live in is between 4 degrees C (39°F) and 10 degrees C (50°F). The red king crab, seen here next to a pound coin for scale, did not survive for long on the beach at Redcar . It is around 4,700 miles from the Bering Sea where king red crabs are normally found to Redcar in Yorkshire . Depending on the stage in their life they live at different depths - moving to between 20 and 50 metres by the age of two and down to 200 metres as adults. Mr McCreadie said: 'I know my crustaceans and when I saw this one, I knew it was special. 'I know king crabs are common in the Arctic, especially around Alaska, and they have turned up in Norway recently, but how on earth this one has got so far south, I have no idea. 'To my knowledge, this is the first one. 'It could only come from very cold, deep water but we don’t have very cold deep water in the North Sea. Perhaps it was on its summer holidays.' Red king crabs are considered a pest in Norway where they are invading fjords. Only a handful of fishermen are allowed to catch the giant crabs, as shown above, due to a diplomatic agreement with Russia .","The red king crab is normally found in the Bering Sea off the Alaskan coast .

"Families of patients being cared for at a £430 million flagship hospital are outraged after their loved ones were given 'Downtown Abbey-style' handbells to attract attention. Those given the metal bells at Southmead Hospital in Bristol include a frail 84-year-old who couldn't pick one up. The state-of-the-art unit opened in May, but 23 clinical rooms - used when there is a lack of other beds - are still without a proper electronic patient alert system. Dementia patient Molly Goddard, 84, was placed in a clinical room after being rushed to hospital with a broken hip. Her son Andy, 57, claims she was put into a side room and told to ring the bell if she needed help - but says his mother was too weak to pick it up. Patients given the metal bells at Southmead Hospital in Bristol include a frail dementia patient Molly Goddard, 84, who was too weak to pick it up. She had been rushed to hospital after a fall and later died . He criticised the 'antiquated' system as being 'like something out of Downton Abbey'. 'We were given a bell as an emergency call service,' he said. 'They said ""sorry, just ring the bell if you need any help because there is no call system in this room"". 'This is from a hospital that cost £430million to build. 'In a state-of-the-art hospital that they use a little brass bell is incredible. It sounds like something out of Downton Abbey. 'It's ridiculous really. The hospital is a beautiful building - you would think you are going into a shopping centre or a hotel, and they spent a quarter of a million on a clock. 'My mum couldn't even pick up a glass of water, let alone a bell.' State-of-the-art Southmead Hospital opened last May and high tech alert systems were installed at 800 bedsides -  but not in 'clinical rooms' used in busy periods. Hospital bosses said doorbells were tested, but the 23 hand bells - costing a total of £91.77 - were deemed to be the most audible and handed out in October. The state-of-the-art unit at the £430m flagship Southmead Hospital in Bristol opened in May. But 23 clinical rooms - used when there is a lack of other beds - are still without a proper electronic patient alert system . A spokesperson said they were a 'short term' solution, and would be replaced with the proper alert system in a month. But Mr Goddard, a signmaker, said the situation should have been remedied since his mother was admitted in December. She fell at home while cooking her dinner and after an hour and a half in a 'freezing' corridor she was taken for an X-ray and given a cubicle in A&E. But the next morning the pensioner was moved into a small procedure room - which he described as 'more like a storage room' - where she was handed a bell. She had surgery on her hip, and was taken to a proper ward, but passed away earlier this month. 'There were piles of medical boxes on the side and staff kept apologising and coming in to get things from the cupboards,' he said. The 23 metal hand bells were purchased by the trust in late October as an 'interim measure' 'That was quite some time ago. It needs something doing now.' Bristol North West MP Charlotte Leslie also criticised the bells. She said: 'While it's good they are making alternative arrangements, it's yet another example of glitches in the system.' Sue Jones, director of nursing and quality and North Bristol NHS Trust said: 'To help our winter capacity, improve patient flow through the hospital and reduce the amount of time patients are waiting in A&E, we use procedure rooms on a short-term basis until a regular room becomes available. 'These 23 clinical rooms on the wards are entirely appropriate for safe and dignified patient care and are more suitable and comfortable for patients than waiting in A&E. 'In this environment we are able to deliver the best care to our patients. 'These rooms are not currently connected to the electronic call bell system which has been in place for the other 800 patient beds since the new hospital opened in May. 'In order to ensure that patients can call nurses 23 metal hand bells were purchased by the trust in late October as an interim measure. 'Prior to buying these bells other solutions were tested in the ward areas and the hand bell was found to be most appropriate as it could be heard throughout the ward. 'We anticipate that the electronic call bell system will be extended to these rooms in a month. 'I met with Mrs Goddard and her son back in December to discuss their concerns and offered my apologies.'","Patients at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, were given the metal bells .
23 clinical rooms are still without a proper electronic patient alert system .

"Emmerdale actress Gemma Oaten has spoken out about an eating disorder that could have claimed her life. The 30-year-old actress from Hull started starving herself at the age of ten when she fell under the grip of body dysmorphia. 'I have a vivid memory of getting out of the bath when I was ten and looking down and at my body and asking my dad, ""am I fat?""' she revealed on today's This Morning. Scroll down for video . Emmerdale actress Gemma Oaten smiled and waved at the cameras as she arrived at the ITV Studios today to share her story on This Morning of how an eating disorder could have killed her . The soap star told presenters Eammon Holmes and Ruth Langsford that her eating disorder was a mental health illness. She wasn't trying to be thin out of vanity or because she was influenced by pictures of slim celebrities in magazines. 'It started when ten years old, I was reading the Beano and Dandy back then,' she said. 'My feelings towards myself were changing, I was getting bullied at school. 'The onset of puberty played a massive factor as I went from being a tomboy full of personality and bubbly. 'I remember going through puberty and all of a sudden the boys I had played football with, I was playing kiss chase with, and then girls started to get jealous. I couldn't control what they said about me but I could control what was happening inside me. 'It's heartbreaking to say it but I remember looking in the mirror and thinking if there's less of me, there's less of me for people to see and hurt.' Gemma, pictured on This Morning, said her eating disorder began when she was just ten-years-old . The actress was joined on the ITV show by her boyfriend, actor Andy Barnes . Gemma's weight plummeted to four-and-a-half stone and it was then that her parents Dennis and Marg intervened and made her seek help. 'I was killing myself in front of my family, it caused a lot of heartache for all of us,' she admitted. She was sent to a children's psychiatric unit but she said 'it wasn't the right place for me personally, it was a very scary time.' Elaborating on this point in today's Mirror, she said: 'The memories of my time in hospital were very bleak and full of despair. I found myself in quite scary situations. I had things thrown at my head, I'd have people discussing in detail how they were abused, people cutting themselves in front of me. It was horrendous. 'I wasn't showing signs of psychosis, I was just a young girl suffering from an illness and, yes, it was a mental health illness but it is very different to somebody who is schizophrenic or who cuts herself. 'It all went wrong because it focused on getting the calories down me and not dealing with the reason I was struggling with an eating disorder. Gemma, pictured eight in a scene from Emmerdale, joined the soap in 2011 and is now using her public profile to raise awareness of eating disorders . Young women from the age of 12 are most likely to develop an eating disorder (file photo) 'In the end my parents made the decision to take me out of there when they found out what was going on.' It wasn't until her 20s that she was fully on the road to recovery and finally able to beat the eating disorder. 'The turning point was at 20 when my best friend killed himself. I looked around at the funeral and saw how devastated everyone was and I thought ""I'm doing same, I can't do this anyone, I have to get better"",' she recalled on This Morning. Gemma was not being over-dramatic, according to the charity Beat, eating disorders claim more lives than any other mental illness – one in five of the most seriously affected will die prematurely from the physical consequences or suicide. Gemma, who appeared on This Morning to promote Eating Disorder Awareness Week is now thankful she got the help she needed before it was too late. She started having therapy and says she's now fully recovered. She said: 'I'm fine now and I am speaking out about it as I want people to look at me and see I am not ashamed I had an eating disorder and now I'm well.' Gemma joined the cast of Emmerdale in 2011 and is now in a relationship with actor Andy Barnes, who joined her on the This Morning sofa today. She said it's thanks to the support of her friends and family that she survived and she urges other sufferers to seek help as soon as possible. 'My message is for people to talk about how they are feeling and not feel shame,' she said.","Actress, 30, from Hull, started starving herself  age ten after being bullied .

"Liverpool's owners insist Brendan Rodgers' position is not even up for discussion as he seeks to get their dreadful season on an even keel. The manager admitted his job would be on the line after his side crashed to their fourth consecutive defeat at Crystal Palace on Sunday and that he was 'not arrogant enough' to think he was safe regardless. But as he prepares to take Liverpool to Bulgaria for their vital Champions League clash with Ludogorets, there is not even the slightest suggestion that Fenway Sports Group, the club's American owners, are contemplating making a change. Brendan Rodgers, frustrated on the touchline at Crystal Palace, is safe in his job as Liverpool boss for now . Liverpool co-owners John Henry (left) and Tom Werner (right) are set to stick with Rodgers as manager . They backed Rodgers in the summer when giving him a new four-year contract after he had guided Liverpool to within two points of winning the title and showed their support by giving him £116million to re-shape the squad following the sale of Luis Suarez. Rodgers frequently says he has 'good communication' with FSG's main men - John W Henry, Tom Werner and Mike Gordon - and FSG remain convinced last season's Manager of the Year is the man to take Liverpool forward for the long-term. Speaking after his side's 3-1 defeat at Selhurst Park on Sunday, Rodgers said: 'Any manager will tell you that you have to win games and get results, particularly after the way we have been developing as a club. 'I have great communication with the owners. We've been honest enough with each other and we have to get results. 'You have to perform. Owners and directors and chairmen have to see development on the field. Three straight league defeats, and no points in November, have left Liverpool in real trouble in the league . Injuries to Daniel Sturridge have highlighted Rodgers' team's lack of attacking threat up front this season . 'Barring this period, our development has been very good and fast. But there's no doubt you have to get results. 'That will support the confidence to the owners, and you take it from there. I will only ever do my best. 'The best has seen us develop well. Now I must fight even harder. The full responsibility comes down to me. 'Now I have to fight even harder and take the responsibility.

"The three east London schoolgirls who left the UK for Syria are feared to be heading into the hands of a hard-core group of British female jihadis who are said to be running an lslamic State ultra-religious police force. Police said last night that they believe Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, have now crossed into the embattled country from Turkey. Begum has forged social media links with three of the British leaders of the al-Khansa brigade - an all-women militia set up by the terror group a year ago. Covered in black from head-to-toe and wielding automatic weapons, the group has been accused of doling out savage beatings on the streets of Raqqa and spying on its citizens. It is said to mercilessly patrol the streets of ISIS' adopted capital and has previously declared children as young as nine should be married, women should obey men - who are their masters - and remain 'hidden and veiled' at all times. Exodus: Amira Abase (left), 15, and Kadiza Sultana (right), 16, also travelled to Istanbul from UK on February 17 before reportedly entering Syria - where they could now be under the control of deadly female insurgents . Life of terror: 15-year-old Shamima Begum (pictured) - one of three British teenagers who is now believed to be inside Syria - contacted Aqsa Mahmood who is considered to be one of the leaders of brutal all-woman militant group al-Khansa . Extreme beliefs: The Al-Khansa Brigade (pictured with automatic weapons) has said children as young as nine should be encouraged to marry and it is women's duty to obey men - who are their masters . Armed patrol: Chilling footage from inside ISIS' adopted capital Raqqa revealed how the notorious women of al-Khansa patrol the streets with automatic weapons - while tending to their toddlers . Begum contacted Aqsa Mahmood, a 20-year-old woman from Glasgow who fled to Syria in 2013. Mahmood is a key figure in the al-Khansa brigade according to researchers at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) based in King's College in London. Begum has also used her Twitter account to follow two other members of the al-Khansa brigade known only by their Islamic names Umm Khattab and Umm Waqqas. In one of her recent tweets, Umm Waqqas advised British women on marriage in the Islamic State saying they should choose their jihadi fighters carefully and not to marry any 'Tom Dick or Harry'. And on Monday 18-year-old Umm Khattab urged British Muslim women to leave for Syria immediately. She said on her Twitter account that it was better to travel to Syria than to stay in the UK where she complained that Muslims were forced to sign a petition in order to keep eating halal meat. The British women jihadists in Syria have conducted a sustained recruitment campaign in the last few months and are thought to operate a woman-only jihadi route for European girls who are groomed to leave their Western lives for the caliphate. They use social media, including Tumblr, Twitter and Askfm to publish detailed, practical advice about how to adapt to life in Islamic State and suggest essential items that the teenage wannabe-jihadists will find useful when they arrive. Privately-educated Glaswegian Aqsa Mahmood - along with Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22 - are thought to be helping patrol Raqqa with guns and daggers hidden beneath their robes. Terror leader: Aqsa Mahmood (pictured), who was reported missing by her Scottish parents in 2013, is now a prominent member of a dangerous all-woman police force that dishes out savage beatings on the streets of Raqqa, Syria . Shocking: In 2014, Aqsa Mahmood posted this photograph of her holding the severed head of a Syrian man executed for criminal acts in Syria as young children looked on . Trained to kill: One of the Halane twins, who fled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, tweeted this picture with the caption: 'Fun day training for self defence in the Islamic State with humble sisters' Wrong hands: The three teenagers who recently fled to Syria are feared to be with the al-Khansa Brigade, who have been accused of oppressively monitoring the behaviour of women in the city . The group operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in the city and dishing out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black, or those wearing veils made from the wrong material. Mahmood recently advised that the Syrian winter was even colder than what she had experienced in her native Scotland and suggested 'winter woolies' were an essential. 17-year-old British jihadi twins Salma and Zahra Halane from Manchester, who left for Syria in June last year, are thought to be with older British women who have taken on matriarchal roles within the group. They have been posting pictures on their Twitter accounts showing four al-Khansa women - veiled and armed with automatic weapons - undertaking 'self defence' training. Umm Khattab started a Twitter account on June 27 - the day after Zahra and Salma Halane went missing from their home in Manchester to head for Syria. Jihadi brides: Zahra and Salma Halane, 17, left their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to join the Al-Khansa Brigade in Syria in June last year - after becoming radicalised online . Shooting practice: One of the twins tweeted an image showing the women of Al-Khansa practising with their automatic weapons while dressed head-to-toe in black niqabs . Brain washed: The Halane twins have posted a number of pictures on their accounts where they are dressed completely in black and brandishing deadly weapons - just like their Al-Khansa sisters . Path of extremism: Yusra Hussein (pictured), 16, was also reported to have arrived in Syria in October and is also thought to have been mentored by British jihadists . She later tweeted: 'Missing twins – chilling with one of them now', adding she had met 'many British girls' since arriving in Syria. The female branch of ISIS also released an eye-opening manifesto stating Western women who join the terror group have a duty to wed a jihadi - then spend their life cooking, cleaning and raising a family. And in December last year, the group allegedly tortured a breastdeeding mother by clamping her breasts with a barbaric spiked clamp. It uses the 'medieval' device to punish women who defy its strict laws according to media group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, who says another 24-year-old was also arrested for breastfeeding her child in the city centre. Two other British schoolgirls, Yusra Hussien, 16, from Bristol and Samya Dirie, 17, from south London, who were reported to have arrived in Syria in October, are also thought to have been mentored by the British jihadists. Brutal patrols: The duties of the all-woman jihadi group  include the strict enforcement of sharia law dress code as well as searching burka-clad women to ensure they are not enemy fighters in disguise . Torturous rule: in December last year, the Al-Khansa group (member pictured) allegedly tortured a breastdeeding mother by clamping her breasts with a barbaric spiked clamp . Jihadi bride: Another Briton who left Britain to join ISIS is Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare (left, with her Swedish terrorist husband Abu Bakr) Muslim society: Members of the all-female Al-Khansa Brigade are seen walking in their adopted capital of Raqqa in Syria . Security services say that 600 British Muslims have gone to fight in Syria and around 60 of them are young women. According to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, a US-based monitoring group, al-Khansa was set up by IS commanders in Raqqa, northern Syria, in February last year. Its members dress in black robes, wear a full face veil and are paid a monthly salary of 25,000 Syrian pounds - about £100. Their duties include the strict enforcement of sharia law dress code as well as searching burka-clad women to ensure they are not enemy fighters in disguise. Its leader is believed to be a six foot tall woman named Umm Hamza who carries a gun, an electric cattle-prod and daggers beneath her robes. Nicknamed 'the slaughterer', she is thought to have previously been responsible for carrying out lashings and other punishments at Raqqa's women's prison. But some of the British members are the most extreme members of the group and are responsible making barbaric threats against Britain. Last year Umm Khattab said she wanted 'David Cameron's head on a spike' as she decried the Prime Minister's new laws to counter terrorism in the UK. Uniform: Al-Khansa's members dress in black robes, wear a full face veil and are paid a monthly salary of 25,000 Syrian pounds - about £100 . Deadly: British members of the female militant group are the most extreme members of the group and are responsible making barbaric threats against Britain . She is believed to have recently moved away from the bombing in Raqqa and is now living in the IS-run city of Manbij, also in northern Syria, with the twins Salma and Zahra Halane. But it is Aqsa Mahmood who is regarded as taking the leading role within the British group. She was reported missing by her parents a year ago before surfacing in Syria last February as an outspoken supporter of the terrorist group. In her tweets, she urged Muslim men and women who could not come to fight to instead commit terrorist atrocities at home, praising the brutal murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, the bombing of the Boston Marathon and the shooting of soldiers at Fort Hood in Texas. 'If you cannot make it to the battlefield, then bring the battlefield to yourself,' she tweeted.","Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana believed to be in Syria .

"Two U.S. tourists became stranded on a deserted beach after setting their satnav to a remote beauty spot - because they required a ferry to get there. The two men from Texas followed their GPS so closely that they became stuck in the sand on Tenby beach in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, half a mile away from their intended destination. Their satnav had not told them they needed a ferry to reach Caldey Island - and the boats do not even run at this time of year, restricted only to services in the summer months. Stuck: The two U.S. men followed their GPS so closely that they become stuck in the sand on Tenby beach . Pushed out: Their satnav had not told them they needed a ferry to reach Caldey Island across the water . Destination: Caldey has had residents since the Stone Age, and monks have lived there since Celtic times . Local residents headed for the pair’s hired Vauxhall Zafira Tourer and helped them dig it out of the sand - before towing it off the beach before the tide came in. Welsh Water sub-contractor Les Langford, who lives in nearby Penally, said on Facebook: ‘They stopped at Penally railway station trying to find the road to Caldey. ‘It was on their satnav showing a road from Penally to Caldey. I sent them back to the harbour in Tenby to get to Caldey, but I did not mean by car. ‘It might be an island, but try telling a satnav that. (We) have had quite a few in Penally trying to cross. Maybe (we) should open a toll and charge for the crossing - it will only be one-way though.’ Caldey has had residents since the Stone Age, and various orders of monks have lived there since Celtic times. It is now owned by monks of the Cistercian Order. From beach to island: The ferry service from Tenby to Caldey in Wales operates from Easter to October . Island: Caldey is owned by monks of the Cistercian Order, and is only open to visitors by ferry in the summer . Map: The men became stuck on Tenby beach (top), but had intended to make it to Caldey Island (bottom) Pete Prosser, who runs a tourist attraction in the area, said: ‘The satnav took them to the closest beach to Caldey Island. But the only way to get there is by boat. ‘The couple were surprised they couldn’t drive there and were highly embarrassed. Passers-by helped them dig their car out of the sand - then someone arrived with a 4x4 to tow them back to the road.’ The ferry service, which costs £12 return for adults, operates from Easter to October - and the boats are owned by local residents, many of whom are lifeboat volunteers. A post on the Tenby Island Facebook page said: ‘We really must thank these two fellas - for entertainment value alone. These two visiting Indian Americans apparently set Caldey into the satnav of their hired car. ‘Three separate attempts to tow out, much digging and three hours later they managed to get back to the safety of the slipway courtesy of a local 4x4.’","Two men from Texas got stuck in sand on Tenby beach, Pembrokeshire .

"A nursery nurse and her boyfriend murdered their 11-month-old son then claimed his injuries were caused by the family dog, a court heard today. Oliver Sargent collapsed at his home in Telford, Shropshire, and was found not breathing by his parents Paul Thomas, 29, and Ashlea Thomas, 21, before being taken to hospital by ambulance. A scan revealed the toddler had suffered a three-inch fracture to the left rear side of his skull, as well as bleeding to the right side of his brain and bleeding to his left eye. Scroll down for video . Death: Oliver Sargent (pictured) collapsed at his home in Telford and was found not breathing by his parents . Doctors also discovered he had historic injuries including healing fractures to two of his left ribs and a fracture to his left collarbone, Birmingham Crown Court was told. He was at first admitted to Princess Royal Hospital in Telford but died from head injuries four days later at Birmingham Children’s Hospital in July 2012. While being quizzed by police Mr Thomas claimed the injuries may have been inflicted by their dog Rocco knocking over Oliver or sitting on him, the court heard. Mrs Thomas - who married Mr Thomas after their son’s death - also told doctors that previous injuries he had suffered may have actually been caused by him rolling over his toys. Parents: Paul Thomas (left), 29, and Ashlea Thomas (right), 21, outside Birmingham Crown Court where they deny charges of murder, causing or allowing death and child cruelty . His parents were initially arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm while Oliver was still alive - but the couple were then charged with murder after his death. Andrew Smith QC, prosecuting, told the court: ‘Paul Thomas said he had not really got a clue about how Oliver had got any of his injuries other than to suggest an incident involving the family dog.’ He said experts’ opinions had led to a conclusion that Oliver had suffered ‘deliberately inflicted injuries immediately before his collapse and the calling of the emergency services’. Mr Smith added: ‘The prosecution contends that there was a recent skull, brain and eye injury with no credible explanation other than deliberately inflicted injury.’ Treatment: Oliver was at first admitted to Princess Royal Hospital (pictured) in Telford but died from head injuries four days later at Birmingham Children’s Hospital in July 2012. The court heard Mr Thomas, a ground worker on building sites, even asked a police officer how long he would be sent to jail over what had happened to Oliver. During the same journey, Mrs Thomas asked an officer if they thought she had ‘battered’ her baby son. She was allegedly later overheard by a nurse asking her mother ‘how long do you think I am going to get’, but then told police it was a reaction to ‘everyone pointing the finger’ of blame. The couple, from Telford, deny murder, causing or allowing the death of a child and child cruelty. The trial, estimated to last five weeks, continues.

"Sharon Hinton, 56, was horrified to find the metal iron Monopoly piece when she took a bit of coleslaw . A grandmother-of-one was horrified to find a metal Monopoly piece in her Sainsbury's coleslaw. Sharon Hinton, 56, from Hornchurch in Essex, was tucking into her 'Taste the Difference' pot when she bit down on something hard and was astonished to find the mini iron. The mother-of-three called the supermarket and was told to throw away the coleslaw, wash out the pot and bring the container and iron back to the store so it could be analysed. Mrs Hinton opened the coleslaw at the weekend and was finishing it off on Monday with salmon, a scotch egg and a tomato. Hasbro, the company which makes the board game, replaced the iron playing piece with a cat following a poll in 2013 and it is no longer produced. She said: 'I just could not believe it when I saw the iron. They don't even sell Monopoly at the store I bought it in. 'How on earth did it get there? It makes me think that someone took it out of their pocket and just put it in there. 'And if they did are they going through the whole set? It's really worrying. I think it has been done out of spite, I can't understand how it could have been a mistake.' The retired customer service worker, who is married to Clive, 60, said she emailed Sainsbury's but got no response so then phoned the head office. She added: 'I feel that no-one is taking me seriously, I have only spoken to someone because I had to chase them up. 'I wasn't really sure what to say when he said wash the pot out and bring it back with the iron, so I agreed, but I'm not doing that at the moment. 'I have also emailed Environmental Health, but I haven't heard anything back yet. I'm going to wait to speak to them before I decide what to do. She was advised by Sainsbury's to wash out the pot and take it back to the store along with the mini iron (right) but she has so far decided to keep hold of it in fear that the supermarket is trying to get rid of evidence . Toy maker Hasbro replaced the iron token with a cat following a poll in 2013 and it is no longer produced . 'It's still wrapped in clingfilm and sat in my fridge at the moment. It feels like they're asking me to get rid of the evidence. 'They said they will analyse it, but what will there be to analyse if there's no coleslaw in it? 'I felt quite sick after biting into it, God knows where it has been, wrapped up in a snotty tissue in someone's pocket? I could have choked or it could have been a young child.' Mrs Hinton has a two-year-old granddaughter called Maisie but insists she would not have put the toy in the food as she doesn't even own a Monopoly set. She said: 'I am sure it came from the coleslaw. There was about two inches at the bottom and I used to a soup spoon so put it onto my plate. 'It definitely came for the coleslaw. I don't even own a Monopoly set, neither does my daughter. 'Maisie wouldn't have been messing around with it, none of us in the family have the game so she would have no way of even having the iron.' A Sainsbury's spokesperson said: 'Food safety is our top priority and we take very rare cases such as this extremely seriously. 'We need the container to identify the exact product and supplier, so that we can conduct a proper investigation. 'We've asked Sharon to return it to her nearest store so we can look into this properly, and we'll keep her updated.' The local environmental health department has confirmed it is investigating the incident. The cat fended off competition from a robot, diamond ring, helicopter and guitar to become the new token . In 2013 Toy maker Hasbro asked millions of Monopoly fans to vote on which of its eight tokens to get rid off and what it should be replaced by. The iron, which featured in the game since its creation in 1935, secured just 8 per cent of a vote and was retired. It's replacement, the cat, came top with 31 per cent of the poll and remained a firm favourite throughout the voting. It fended off competition from a robot, diamond ring, helicopter and guitar by voters from more than 120 countries. The online contest to change the tokens was sparked by chatter on Facebook, where Monopoly has more than 10 million fans. Monopoly's iconic tokens originated when the niece of game creator Charles Darrow suggested using charms from her charm bracelet for tokens. The eight original tokens were an iron, racecar, Scottie dog, a shoe, thimble, top hat, wheelbarrow and battleship. Most of the pieces were introduced with the first Parker Brothers iteration of the game in 1935, and the Scottie dog and wheelbarrow were added in the early 1950s. The original U.S. version of the game is based on the streets of Atlantic City, N.J., and has sold more than 275 million units worldwide. To make the game relevant to fans abroad, the names are changed to well-known streets when it is introduced to a new country.","Sharon Hinton, 56, was tucking into coleslaw when she bit something hard .

"Olympic rower James Cracknell, TV historian Dan Snow and presenter Jeremy Paxman are among the celebrities being tipped to replace Sir Malcolm Rifkind as a Tory MP. The veteran politician, who has held the seat since 2005, announced yesterday that he was stepping down as MP for Kensington after becoming mired in the latest cash for access scandal. The announcement has triggered a race to see who will replace the Tory grandee in what is traditionally been one of the safest Conservative seats in the country, just months before the election. Scroll down for video . Olympic double gold medallist James Cracknell (left) and TV historian Dan Snow (right) are among those tipped to be replacing Sir Malcolm Rifkind as MP for Kensington . Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, who last year denied he was in the running as Tory candidate for London Mayor, is also rumoured to be on the list of those who could stand for the safe Conservative seat . Now a string of well-known faces are rumoured to be poised for stepping into the Tory  seat, including footballer Frank Lampard, cricketer Andrew Strauss and Sol Campbell. According to Ladbrokes, the favourite to replace Sir Malcolm is Greg Smith, a Tory councillor who sits on Hammersmith and Fulham council. But he is closely followed by double Gold medallist James Cracknell, who is odds-on 8/1 for taking over the seat. Following reports that he was popular because he had 'no skeletons' in his cupboard, his TV presenter wife Beverley Turner tweeted: 'No skeletons. A LOT of trainers.' Mr Cracknell recently turned to politics, but failed to clinch the Bexhill and Battle seat in East Sussex and the Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat, where Boris Johnson was selected. Andrew Strauss, the England cricketer, is 10/1 favourite to take over from Sir Malcolm . In May, the father-of-three also stood in the European Parliament elections, but narrowly missed a seat. Last year, Paxman was rumoured to be sounded out by Conservative party as its candidate for the Mayor of London. But he quashed the rumours by saying he would not take the job for 'all the eclairs in Paris'. Last night, a local source said Mr Paxman was a real contender, telling The Daily Telegraph: 'He would have to give up his job for Channel Four in the election but he lives in the borough.' But, according to The Sun, the favourite is Dan Snow, who Number 10 apparently contacted within hours of Sir Malcolm's resignation. The historian, a great-great-grandson of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, last year led a campaign against Scottish Independence, by gathering the names of 200 celebrities who were against the move. He last night tweeted it was a 'safe' and 'glamorous' seat. Local members have reportedly been told by Conservative Central Office that they will be three candidates to choose from and that it is likely to be well-known Tory figure. But Kirstie Allsopp ruled herself out of the running because she does not have a degree. The veteran politician announced yesterday that he is quitting as an MP after being caught in a scandal over alleged cash for access, alongside former foreign secretary Jack Straw . The former Foreign Secretary (pictured) told undercover reporters that he had a usual fee of between £5,000 to £8,000 for a half-day's work for representing private companies . Last night she tweeted: 'My borough needs serious minds for serious times, not pretty faces looking for a career change.' She also shared her support for Sir Malcolm. The former foreign secretary stepped down yesterday, saying it was 'the right and proper' thing to do, but denying any wrongdoing. It emerged this weekend that he had been filmed by undercover reporters after bragging that he could see any foreign ambassador in London and has 'useful access' to every British ambassador in the world. Despite being in charge of the Intelligence and Security Committee, he also boasted about having lots of free time to read and go walking. Mr Snow was reportedly contacted by Number 10, hours after Sir Malcolm's resignation. He yesterday tweeted about the seat, calling it 'safe' and 'glamorous' Ladbrokes published its most recent odds on who is tipped to replace Sir Malcolm for the May election . Labour MP Jack Straw, also a former foreign secretary, was also caught up in the scandal and suspended from the party. Announcing he was standing down as chairman and would not fight the general election in May, Sir Malcolm said: 'I don't think I did anything wrong. I may have made errors of judgment, but that's a different matter.' In a statement announcing his decision to quit the Commons, he added: 'I had intended to seek one further term as MP for Kensington, before retiring from the House of Commons. Meanwhile, Kirsty Allsopp was forced to deny rumours she would be standing for the Conservative seat . She tweeted her support for Sir Malcolm before saying she could not stand for it because she does not have a degree . 'I have concluded that to end the uncertainty it would be preferable, instead, to step down at the end of this Parliament. 'This is entirely my personal decision. I have had no such requests from my constituency association but I believe that it is the right and proper action to take.' Senior Tories were said to be furious at the impact on the party's image just weeks before the election.","Sir Malcolm stood down after becoming mired in cash for access scandal .

"Scientists have witnessed carbon dioxide trapping heat in the atmosphere above the United States, showing human-made climate change 'in the wild' for the first time. A new study in the journal Nature demonstrates in real-time field measurements what scientists already knew from basic physics, lab tests, numerous simulations, temperature records and dozens of other climatic indicators. They say it confirms the science of climate change and the amount of heat-trapping previously blamed on carbon dioxide. Scroll down for video . Scientists witnessed and measured carbon dioxide trapping heat in the sky above, confirming human-caused global warming, using the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer seen here, located in Barrow, Alaska. This graph show carbon dioxide’s increasing greenhouse effect at a research facility in Oklahoma. As the atmospheric concentration of CO2 (blue) increased from 2000 to the end of 2010, so did surface radiative forcing due to CO2 (orange), and both quantities have upward trends. This means the Earth absorbed more energy from solar radiation than it emitted as heat back to space. The seasonal fluctuations are caused by plant-based photosynthetic activity. 'We see, for the first time in the field, the amplification of the greenhouse effect because there's more CO2 in the atmosphere to absorb what the Earth emits in response to incoming solar radiation,' said Daniel Feldman, a scientist in Berkeley Lab's Earth Sciences Division and lead author of the Nature paper. 'Numerous studies show rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but our study provides the critical link between those concentrations and the addition of energy to the system, or the greenhouse effect,' Feldman adds. He said no one before had quite looked in the atmosphere for this type of specific proof of climate change. The scientists used incredibly precise spectroscopic instruments operated by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility, a DOE Office of Science User Facility. These instruments, located at ARM research sites in Oklahoma and Alaska, measure thermal infrared energy that travels down through the atmosphere to the surface. They can detect the unique spectral signature of infrared energy from CO2. Other instruments at the two locations detect the unique signatures of phenomena that can also emit infrared energy, such as clouds and water vapor. The result is two time-series from two very different locations. Each series spans from 2000 to the end of 2010, and includes 3300 measurements from Alaska and 8300 measurements from Oklahoma obtained on a near-daily basis. Both series showed the same trend: atmospheric CO2 emitted an increasing amount of infrared energy, to the tune of 0.2 Watts per square meter per decade. This increase is about ten percent of the trend from all sources of infrared energy such as clouds and water vapor. Based on an analysis of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s CarbonTracker system, the scientists linked this upswing in CO2-attributed radiative forcing to fossil fuel emissions and fires. The measurements also enabled the scientists to detect, for the first time, the influence of photosynthesis on the balance of energy at the surface. They found that CO2-attributed radiative forcing dipped in the spring as flourishing photosynthetic activity pulled more of the greenhouse gas from the air.

The combination of these measurements enabled the scientists to isolate the signals attributed solely to CO2. The combination of these measurements enabled the scientists to isolate the signals attributed solely to CO2. Scientists say carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas is the chief cause of global warming. In doing so, the data show clouds, water vapor or changes in sun's radiation are not responsible for warming the air, as some who doubt mainstream climate science claim, Feldman said. The new study in the journal Nature demonstrates in real-time field measurements what scientists already knew from basic physics, lab tests, numerous simulations, temperature records and dozens of other climatic indicators. Nor could it be temperature data being tampered with, as some contrarians insist, Feldman said. 'The data say what the data say,' Feldman said. 'They are very clear that the rising carbon dioxide is actually contributing to an increased greenhouse effect at those sites.' The study is good technical work, said climate scientist Andrew Dessler of Texas A&M University, but it is expected — sort of like confirming gravity with a falling rock.","Researchers say experiment confirms the science of climate change .

"A 15-year-old schoolboy who allegedly set up a cocaine dealing operation at his secondary school has been questioned by police. Officers received a tip-off that the teenager was dealing the lethal Class A drug in the playground of Poole High School in Dorset at lunchtime on Monday. He was led away in handcuffs in front of stunned classmates after being arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs and has since been bailed. A 15-year-old boy was arrested after he allegedly brought cocaine to Poole High School to deal to students . Headteacher Fan Heafield said: 'We were informed that a student had brought a quantity of drugs into school. 'We immediately called the police and they subsequently arrested a student. 'We are cooperating fully with the police in their ongoing inquiry. The school will always take immediate and strongest action possible in relation to any incident involving drugs. 'As this is a police matter we have no further comment to make at this time.' A spokesman for Dorset Police said: 'We had a call at 12.05pm with reports that it was suspected that a student may be in possession of drugs. 'A 15-year-old boy from Poole was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. He has been bailed until early April pending further inquiries.' More than 1,700 boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 study at Poole High School, which is one of the biggest secondary schools in the county. It is a specialist Business and Enterprise College and was rated 'Good' in 2011 by Ofsted inspectors, who singled out students' good behaviour for praise. The schoolboy was taken away in handcuffs at lunchtime on Monday and bailed pending further inquiries . According to school policy, anyone found in possession of illegal drugs risks immediate expulsion. Poole Town ward councillor Chris Wilson said 'I'm not shocked, but I'm disappointed that something like that has happened. I hope it can be sorted.' She said a working party of councillors had visited Poole High recently to look at their pastoral care and had been quite impressed with the way they looked after the needs of pupils. Conservative town centre councillor Carol Evans said 'I must say if it's true I'm disappointed. 'It's a caring school and has a strong no drugs policy. I'm sure this is against the ethos of the school.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Police received a tip-off that teenager had been dealing lethal Class A drug .

"Federal officials have agreed to let Southwest Airlines keep flying planes that missed an inspection of a backup rudder system if the planes are checked in the next five days. Southwest grounded 128 planes - about one-fifth of its fleet - on Tuesday after discovering the missed inspections. Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said the airline canceled about 80 flights Tuesday and expected to cancel up to 19 more on Wednesday while some inspections are done. She said the airline expected to finish 'a good portion' of the inspections by Wednesday morning. Federal officials have agreed to let Southwest Airlines Co. keep flying planes that missed an inspection of a backup rudder system if the planes are checked in the next five days . The missed inspections involved hydraulic systems used to control the rudder if the main system fails. King said that after discovering the lapse, Southwest immediately notified federal safety regulators, took the planes out of service and began checking them. Late Tuesday night, the Federal Aviation Administration agreed to let the airline resume flying the planes while inspections are done, likely during overnight hours. FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford confirmed that the agency approved the plan after talking with Southwest and Boeing, the manufacturer of the planes. The missed inspections were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Dallas-based Southwest is the nation's fourth-biggest airline. It has 665 jets, all of which are some version of the Boeing 737. Tuesday's groundings involved nearly one-third of its 737-700 models, which seat 137 or 143 passengers, depending on the layout. Southwest was fined in 2009 for failing to inspect dozens of planes for cracks in the fuselage. Southwest agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle with the FAA, which had sought a $10.2 million penalty. In 2011, the FAA ordered extensive inspections of some of Southwest's older 737s after a 5-foot hole burst open in one plane in mid-flight, forcing an emergency landing at a military base in Arizona. Dallas-based Southwest is the nation's fourth-biggest airline .","Federal officials agreed to let the planes fly as long as they are checked in the next five days .

"A holidaymaker escaped with just a few scratches after his car smashed through a barrier on a hairpin bend and plunged almost 200ft down a mountain. James Swann, who was later found to be three times over the legal drink-drive limit, walked away virtually unharmed from the wreckage of his rented Opel Corsa which was severely damaged after it plunged down the Tramuntana mountain range near Andratx in south-west Majorca. The car hit several rocks on the mountain as it careered through the crash barrier and plunged off the cliff edge, before coming to a stop between a boulder and a tree trunk. James Swann was able to walk away virtually unscathed after the hire car he was driving crashed through a barrier and plunged almost 200ft down a mountain in Majorca, hitting rocks and trees as it fell . The rented Vauxhall Opal car was left buckled and damaged by the crash and had to be written off . Officials said it appeared Mr Swann had lost control of the car on the hairpin bend as he drove through the picturesque mountain range. They said he had had a 'very lucky escape.' Mr Swann had to be convinced by police and paramedics who were called to the the scene to go to hospital for a check up following the accident. He was eventually taken by ambulance to the island's Son Espases Hospital after complaining of pain in one of his shoulders. While at the hospital he had a breath test and failed, and was found to be three times over the legal drink-drive limit. Mr Swann had been driving along a hairpin bend when he appeared to lose control of the Vauxhall Opal . The incident took place at around midday on Tuesday. A Civil Guard source said: 'He had a very lucky escape. 'The accident is still being investigated but it appears he lost control of his vehicle on a bend and smashed through a barrier wall before going over the edge. The car has been written off following the accident, which left the front and rear badly damaged . The crumpled front section of the car shows that part of it fell off as it hit rocks and trees during the fall . The inside of the car, beneath the smashed windscreen, show both airbags inflated following the crash . 'He plunged around 180 feet down the side of the cliff. 'His car was a complete write-off. The fact he failed a breath test would appear to indicate excess alcohol played a part in this accident.' It is not known where in the UK Mr Swann is from. Mr Swann was driving along the hairpin bends of the Tramuntana mountain range when the accident happened . Investigations are continuing into the cause of the crash after Mr Swann was found three times over the limit . The road where the accident happened runs the length of the Tramuntana mountain range from Pollensa to Andratx and boasts some of the island's best coastal views. It is regarded as one of the island's best cycling routes. The mountain range, which runs from the south-west to the north-east of Majorca, was given UNESCO World Heritage Status in June 2011.","James Swann was driving a rented car along mountain road in Majorca .

"The US Hispanic population will be responsible for 40 percent of the country's employment growth over the next five years and more than 75 per cent by 2034, a new study found. The report from economic forecaster IHS Global Insight said they will eventually account for an increase of 11 million jobs out of 14 million new positions. Because the Hispanic population is 'younger and faster-growing', higher levels of immigration are 'conducive' to helping U.S. economic growth, the study concludes. The U.S Hispanic population will be responsible for 40 per cent of the country's employment growth over the next five years, and more than 75 per cent by 2034, a new study found (file photo) 'The Hispanic population will play an increasingly significant role in future U.S. employment growth,' said James Gillula, the report's lead author. He said that, by contrast, the non-Hispanic population is aging as the baby-boomer generation moves into retirement. The country's workforce has slowly been declining over the last 10 years, the Wall Street Journal reports. Almost half of the Hispanic labor force last year was under the age of 35 and less than 12 per cent of it was 55 years or older - compared to more than 33 per cent of the non-Hispanic labor force. The study conducted two separate investigations to show how the economy would be affected by different levels of Hispanic population growth, according to the Wall Street Journal. The forecast assuming higher Hispanic immigration growth showed that the country's gross domestic product could increase by 3 per cent annually from 2020 to 2034. In contrast the baseline study, assuming a more restricted immigration policy, showed a 2.5 per cent increase. The findings comes just days before the Homeland Security Department will run out of funding. Almost half of the Hispanic labor force last year was under the age of 35 and less than 12 per cent of it was 55 years or older - compared to more than 33 per cent of the non-Hispanic labor force . In Obama's annual economic report, the White House said growing the workforce, which has slowly been declining over the last 10 years, will be the best way to stabilize the nation's debt . Last month Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a bill that would finance the department while simultaneously repeal recent executive actions by President Obama to protect millions of immigrant families from being deported. President Obama said he would veto any legislation attempting to curtail his changes to immigration policy. In Obama's annual economic report, released last week, the White House said growing the workforce will be the best way to stabilize the nation's debt. Proposed incentives include a $500 tax credit for married couples that consist of two working spouses and tripling tax credit to help cover child care.","The US Hispanic population will account for more than 75 percent by 2034 .

"A software glitch at Melbourne airport caused air traffic controllers to lose the position of at least nine planes on the tarmac. The Senate Estimates committee was told by Independent Senator Nick Xenophon the February 13 incident happened after integrated tower automation suite (INTAS) - a program used for air traffic control - failed. He said he was informed there were at least nine aircrafts who were waiting on the tarmac to take off at the time the software glitch happened about 10pm. Scroll down for video . Central Queensland University's Ronald Bishop said this flaw in INTAS had potential to trigger a similar incident to the one which happened on the Spanish island of Tenerife . 'If this was a foggy night in Melbourne, this could have been potentially a serious incident,' Senator Xenophon told the committee late on Monday night. Central Queensland University's head of program for aviation Ronald Bishop said this flaw in INTAS had potential to trigger a similar incident to the one which happened on the Spanish island of Tenerife, which is considered to be the worst accidents in aviation history. In 1977, two Boeing 747s collided after thick fog prevented air traffic control and pilots to see there were two planes sharing the one runway, killing 583 people. There was no ground radar so the air traffic control could only rely on reports from radio communications. 'For example, if there's a plane on Taxiway Charlie, they're holding them there but then they're not in the system, the controller could potentially put another plane in that spot,' Mr Bishop told Daily Mail Australia. Senator Nick Xenophon (left) told the Senate Estimates committee the incident happened on February 13 and was questioning Air Services Australia executive general manager of air traffic control Greg Hood (right) If this happens then usually the pilot would see the other plane there and tell air traffic control. But Mr Bishop said this link in the 'safety chain' would break if there was heavy fog. 'Now one plane could strike the other one, which is probably full of fuel, and it could cause an issue,' he said. 'This could happen yes... but there are probably four or five scenarios we haven't thought of that could happen. 'Like MH370, we never thought a plane could disappear off the face of the earth. 'I don't know about you but I like people to know where the planes are. Someone should know where they are at all times.' Mr Bishop said if there had been heavy fog then planes could have collided on the taxi runway . On Tuesday, Senator Xenophon told Daily Mail Australia: 'There are genuine concerns of ongoing software problems with INTAS.' He said he had received complaints from air traffic controllers and pilots about the software, and their concerns needed to be looked into adequately. Air Services Australia's Greg Hood told the committee the organisation had been informed about the situation and poor weather conditions had grounded planes for more than an hour. He said this length of inactivity caused a number of planes to disappear off their radar. 'My understanding on that night in question [was] that there was thunderstorm activity and a number of aircraft that were taxiing in from the runway were unable to reach their gate,' Mr Hood told the committee. To fix this problem, the window of time for a plane to stay in the system had been extended to five hours. Mr Hood said he did not anticipate hearing this line of enquiry from Senator Xenophon but could give him more information if the politician wanted it. While the Air Services Australia general manager of air traffic control was speaking, the South Australian representative said he had been sent a text by someone who had been there at time of the incident. Senator Xenophon related the message to the committee, which said the idea that a thunderstorm had caused the glitch was 'crap' as it had already passed over Melbourne.","Senator Nick Xenophon said the incident took place on February 13 .

"New Arsenal academy chief Andries Jonker said the club need to rip up their scouting structure and start afresh if they are to emulate Barcelona in developing young talent. The 52-year-old Dutchman, who was an assistant to Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, said he was working closely with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger on his plans for the academy. In an out-spoken interview, which is likely to unsettle current staff at the academy, Jonker says that the set up which he inherited from Liam Brady requires a complete overhaul. Arsenal's academy manager Andries Jonker wants to entirely restructure the club's academy . Jonker watches on with Steve Morrow during a pre season friendly at Arsenal's training ground . ‘Arsenal want more talented players to come through, because that has been lacking,’ he said. ‘They want me to develop the players from the academy much better than it was done before. ‘At this moment, considering the investments the club have made, players have hardly been developed properly. This is why they wanted me, a man who can guide the coaches and who can influence the other coaches. Jack Wilshere is a product of the Arsenal youth academy but it seems Jonker wants more quality . ‘Ivan Gazidis [Arsenal chief executive] wants Arsenal to be the best academy in the world. He realises that will cost money and will take time, but that is his ambition. ‘The scouting must be restructured all over again. It needs to be brought to a level so that we can bring in the absolute best talents from abroad and from England at an age that Wenger can immediately work with them. The Dutch coach worked with Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal at Bayern Munich and Barcelona . Jonker wants the next Xavi to come through Arsenal's ranks - a big ask to match the legendary Barca man . ‘My chief scout at the academy, Steve Morrow, came and asked me what kind of players I wanted him to look for. So I said, the best player I have worked on, Xavi.’ In the interview with Voetbal International, Jonker said: ‘Almost every day Wenger and I go through a number of things. He is approachable, but I do have to show him what we are doing. We must not go behind his back. ‘It is important that Wenger and I work closely together. What I do see is that everybody at the club has the feeling that they need to have the green light from Wenger before they do anything. But maybe that is not the case. ‘I have a very good feeling about the way Wenger and I are working together. We both think the technical side of the game is very important. ‘But there are a lot of things in the academy which can be improved or should be done different.’ Jonker says that he has a relationship with Arsene Wenger that involves them speaking every day .","Andries Jonker has worked with Louis van Gaal in the past .

"Luke Shaw could be facing three weeks out with ankle ligament damage. The England international went over on his left ankle early on in Saturday's victory over Arsenal and was forced off after 16 minutes. He left the Emirates on crutches wearing a protective boot. The subsequent swelling and bruising has delayed the 19-year-old's scan which will give a clearer picture of how serious the injury is. However, initial concerns are that he is facing a couple of weeks at least on the sidelines. Manchester United defender Luke Shaw receives treatment after injuring his ankle against Arsenal .

"A mother-of-two who once weighed 24 stone and hated her size thought her life would be transformed when she had a gastric wrap to help her slim down. But while the weight loss surgery - similar to having a gastric band - did help Melissa Foreman shed 12st, it didn't leave her with the body of her dreams. Instead the 44-year-old, who lives in Sidcup, London, was left with rolls of unsightly saggy skin on her thighs and stomach. Scroll down for video . Melissa, left, when she weighed 24st thanks to a daily diet of 5000 calories. She's now 11st 5lb, right, following surgery to have her stomach stapled and other operations to have excess skin removed . She told MailOnline: 'My body looked like a deflated balloon. I was a fraud as my body in clothes didn't match what was underneath, I hated it.' Writing in a blog post about her experience, she said she felt 'humiliated' about her appearance and when she saw herself in the mirror, she thought 'there could not be any possible way to come back to anything remotely normal looking'. Melissa had originally gained weight growing up in California where she couldn't resist sweet treats and fast food. She said: 'I was a big child who hid food. It was my best friend and worst enemy. I went from a fat child to a fatter teenager to a morbidly obese adult. 'On a typical day, I would skip breakfast. Then lunch could easily consist of two Big Macs and large fries. 'Dinner was large takeaway or home-cooked massive portions of fat-laden foods. Snacking on crisps and biscuits in between. I was easily consuming 5,000 calories a day.' Melissa hated the saggy skin she was left with on her stomach and thighs after she lost 12st . Now she has a new body after going under the knife again to have 'several pounds' of the skin removed . Melissa's intake of calories was more than double the recommended daily amount for a woman so her weight soared to 24st. In 2009 when she was 38 years old, she had twins and said becoming a mother made her realise she had to do something to improve her health. 'I wanted to be an active mum that could run after them. I already felt at a disadvantage being an older mum. I didn't want to make my life shorter with obesity,' she explained. Melissa researched her options and decided to travel to the Czech Republic for a developing weight loss surgery called a gastric wrap. It involves keyhole surgery to stitch the stomach wall to make it smaller so there is less capacity for food. It works on the same principle as a gastric bypass but is slightly less invasive as a gastric bypass involves a surgical procedure in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower pouch, and then the small intestine is rearranged to connect to both. Following the surgery, Melissa gradually lost weight over the following 18 months. The surgery meant she couldn't eat as much as she could before and she also started going for more healthy food options. She also started exercising as she felt more comfortable running as she became lighter. Melissa, pictured recovering from her skin removal surgery, said the pain was all worth it . But while she was gradually becoming healthier, she was left with a constant reminder of her obese past thanks to her saggy excess skin. So she decided to go under the knife once again in order to have it removed by cosmetic surgeon Paul Baguley. She said: 'The process was done in two stages over three months. The recovery was hard as I was covered in staples and stitches. But, it was not nearly as bad I thought it would be. The pain was worth it. Through plastic surgery I could have the body I worked so hard to get. 'Like a magic wand being run across my body, the evidence of my obesity was erased. Mr Baguley removed several pounds of skin. Where it had creped, my body is now taut and contoured.' Melissa now weighs 11st 5lb and is happy to show off her figure on her blog as she writes to support other people trying to deal with weight and self-esteem issues. She said: 'The new me can run, the new me will live longer and the new me can do anything! I have been extremely lucky that with the intervention of an amazing surgeon, I could be brand new. 'Now in retrospect looking at my pictures (when I had saggy skin), particularly my thighs and stomach, the results are unbelievable. I am not ashamed of those pictures any more. It is a bit like looking at a discarded cocoon now. 'Although not perfect, I am very happy with the butterfly I have become no matter how oddly I fly now and then.'","Melissa Foreman, 44, from London, reached 24st 5,000 calories-a-day diet .

"An ambitious Russian plan has been launched to raise the wreck of an historic vessel that sank during an American hero's 19th century attempt to be the first to reach the North Pole. USS Jeannette floundered in Arctic waters off Siberia after becoming stuck in ice during the daring voyage to the top of the world in 1881, and has remained there ever since. Under the command of naval officer George Washington De Long, the elegant three-master, a former British gunboat, was 141ft long and kitted out in gold and bronze with its own on-board fireplaces. After it sank off the Russian coast, the story of how 13 men survived following an epic escape on foot across frozen Siberia became a legendary tale of courage. Now  the vessel could once more rise from its watery grave. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Equipped: The USS Jeannette before it set sail for the Arctic. It was designed to keep its crew of 33 alive in the frozen wastes, with fireplaces on board and fittings in gold and bronze . Survival: Some of those who finally made it back to safety pictured after surviving their ordeal. In all 23 of the crew lost their lives . Ice-bound: This painting portrays the end of the USS Jeanette, stuck fast in ice which would eventually crush it. Its crew are unloading the supplies packed into the three-master . Remembered: There are two memorials to the USS Jeanette. This one is at the mouth of the Lena River, where the survivors finally came ashore. The Lena is the largest of Siberia's rivers . American author Hampton Sides, who wrote an acclaimed book about the ship's dramatic final voyage last year, said he has already approached the US Navy for assistance but feared the current icy political climate would prevent a salvage operation. On the other side of the Bering Strait, Siberian adventurer Andrey Y -- well-known in Russia as a director, screenwriter, TV personality and traveler whose real name is Andrey Khoroshev -- has begun his own initiative to raise the wreck in consultation with the Geographic Society, whose board of trustees is headed by Vladimir Putin. 'This vessel lies at a depth of only 18 meters [54 feet], with the known location down to one kilometer [two-thirds of a mile]. So in modern day conditions, to find and raise it is not such a hard task,' he told The Siberian Times. 'Imagine what kind of event it would be, and what it would do for our relations with America which are not very good right now. 'So perhaps we should give them a generous present by raising it.' Whether such a salvage operation would be seen as a 'generous present' or a grab at American property in the context of increasingly tense relations between Moscow and Washington remains to be seen. Epic: The map shows Henrietta Island, the freshly-discovered land which the USS Jeanette was stranded beside - and gives some idea of the sheer remoteness of the sea where the crew found themselves . Sinking: Contemporary illustrations told the story of the USS Jeanette, claimed by the might of the ice . Hell: The first stage of their trek saw the crew drag their boats across pack ice which persisted even in the Arctic's summertime . Dismal: After their trek across the ice the crew took to their three boats but one capsized with the loss of seven men. The two remaining boats separated and took different routes to land . Safety: The woodcut shows how so few survived when they eventually gathered at Yakutsk, capital of the Siberian territory now known as Sakha . The vessel is a memory of America's bid to reach the North Pole and the effort comes amid an increasingly aggressive grab by Putin's Russia over Arctic territories. Moscow - along with the US, Canada and other countries bordering the Arctic - are staking conflicting territorial claims to the potential oil and gas bonanza. In recent months, Putin has ordered Russia to re-establish military bases in the region, and despite economic problems caused by Western sanctions over Ukraine plus low oil prices, he is pouring investment into his vast northern coastline. This month has seen a major army drill in the Russian Arctic region. Ground Forces Commander Col. Gen. Oleg Salyukov said this week: 'The Arctic brigades' role is to defend the Russian national interests.' He vowed that 'specialized equipment and weaponry will guarantee their effective operation in the northern latitudes'. Russia is currently making a claim to the United Nations that major undersea ridges are an extension of the Siberian land mass. If approved, Moscow will get the right to exploit the energy riches. Eight years ago, a submarine planted a titanium Russian flag on the seabed under the North Pole, signaling Putin's intentions. Last summer, the Kremlin strongman broke off from speaking about strife-torn Ukraine to tell a youth camp audience: 'We should pay more attention to issues of development of the Arctic and the strengthening of our position here.' The US Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic Circle includes 22 per cent of global recoverable energy resources, and Putin is determined to get his hands on the lion's share. The USS Jeanette harks back to America's attempts to claim the same territory. And the vessel herself represents a tale of adventure in the most difficult circumstances - and a dramatic battle for survival. Built in 1861, as the Royal Navy Philomel-class gunboat HMS Pandora, she lies off the most northerly island of Russia's diamond-rich Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia. Snow-bound: Henrietta Island, which was named by the crew of the USS Jeanette today . Pack ice: The scale of the ice around Henrietta Island shows why the USS Jeanette became stuck . Mapped: The thin black line shows the progress of the different boats towards land. Just 10 men survived . Captain: George Washington De Long was captain of the USS Jeanette but was one of those to lose his life . Mission: Kremlin-backed adventurer Andrey Khoroshev wants to lead the Russian expedition to raise the USS Jeanette . Large crowds watched her set sail from San Francisco on her fateful voyage on 7 July 1879, to begin a daring bid backed by the US government to reach the North Pole. She progressed well through the Chukchi Sea but, just two months after leaving port, she caught fast in ice near Wrangel Island and drifted northwards for almost two years. During their ice-bound odyssey floating through the Arctic waters, De Long and his crew maintained unique scientific records of their journey. 'A full meteorological record is kept, soundings are taken, astronomical observations made and positions computed, dip and declination of the needle observed and recorded - everything we can do is done as faithfully, as strictly, as mathematically as if we were at the Pole itself, or the lives of millions depended on our adherence to routine,' he wrote in his journal. They even discovered two previously unknown islands and duly named them Jeannette and Henrietta. But their success was short-lived and on 12 June 1881, the pressure of the creaking ice crushed and sank their ship. The men did have enough time to salvage food onto small boats but they were left marooned more than 500 miles north of the Siberian mainland. Yet what happened next became legendary as the crew, dragging their provisions across the ice, somehow survived ~ and even discovered more land which they claimed for America, though it is now Russian. Author: Hampton Sides approached the US Navy to discuss the possibility of them retrieving their own vessel but says the current political climate makes it unlikely. He is pictured with a mammoth tusk . Memorial: The USS Jeannette  Jeannette Monument in the United States Naval Academy Cemetery. Its design was based on the cairn raised in Siberia in the aftermath of the death of most of the crew . Remembered: Hampton Sides published his history of the epic struggle of the Jeannette last year . This uncharted outpost was named Bennett Island, after eccentric US newspaper tycoon Gordon Bennett Jnr who had funded the Arctic mission. None of the 33 crew were lost in the sinking but 20 perished - including Captain De Long himself - during the grueling trek to reach the mainland. Some wreckage from the Jeannette was found in June 1884 on an ice floe close to southern Greenland, allowing scientists to establish that Arctic ice was in constant motion. Writer Hampton Sides - author of 'In the Kingdom of Ice: The Grand and Terrible Voyage of the USS Jeannette' - recently said he was keen on finding the ship to ensure a piece of US history is not lost forever. 'We know almost exactly where the Jeannette is because when it sank, De Long's men took very meticulous positional readings. 'The only problem is that it's in Russian waters, near some islands that are somewhat disputed - the De Long Islands (named after the captain). 'So the hurdles for finding the Jeannette are more geopolitical than archaeological. 'I'm hoping this book might create an environment that down the line, when our relationship improves with the Russians, we could send out an expedition to recover the ship. 'I've spoken with some folks in the Navy and at NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) who are interested. 'It's certainly one of my passions. One of my secret wishes.' The voyage was 'at the very end of the nautical age of polar exploration, when there were still people who thought you could somehow reach the North Pole by ship,' he said. 'The North Pole seemed as inaccessible as the moon. There was also a good bit of nationalism behind it. We wanted to beat the British and the Scandinavians and the other powers.' It took until 1908 for the first men to eventually reach the North Pole on foot.

"Google announced yesterday the purchase of Boston Dynamics, a company that builds military robots - though no one knows what the search engine has planned for the cyborgs. This was the eighth robotics acquisition in the past sixth months. The initiative is headed by Andy Rubin, the executive responsible for leading development on the Android smartphone, who says the project is a 'moonshot' and that product development is still several years away. Up until their purchase by Google, Boston Dynamics was making research robots for the Defense Adanvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the U.S. government agency responsibly for developing new military technologies. Wanna race? Google recently purchased robotics company Boston Dynamics, which has developed a robot that can run faster than the fastest human . Google would not say how much they paid for the company and will not be releasing financial information. They said the company will fulfill all current government contracts, but that Google will not be taking on any more military work. Boston Dynamics was founded in Waltham, Massachusetts by ex-MIT professor  Dr Marc Raibert in 1992. Since then, they have been developing . animal-like robots that can travel faster than the fastest human, and . even cover difficult terrains like snowy hills and icy roads. Slipping and sliding: The Boston Dynamics robot named Big Dog can cover all types of terrain, and is pictured maintaining balance even on a sheet of ice . Fast one: WildCat is another of Boston Dynamics' super fast robots. WildCat isn't as fast as Cheetah, but can cover a variety of terrains . While most of their work has been done for the U.S. government, Dr Daibert told the New York Times that he does not consider his company to be a military contractor and they are simply trying to advance robotics technology. Second place: The robot named Cheetah can run one mile per hour quicker than the world's fastest sprinter, gold-medal Olympian Usain Bolt (pictured) One of the projects they're currently working on for DARPA is the creation of a robot that can  operate in a natural disaster, like the nuclear power plant meltown in Fukushima, Japan. 'Competitions like the DARPA Robotics Challenge stretch particpants to solve problems that matter and we hope to learn from the team's insight around disaster relief,' Mr Rubin said in a statement released by Google. And the company has been pretty transparent on what they're developing. They even have their own YouTube account where they show off what their robots can do. A robot named 'Cheetah' was designed for maximum speed, and was filmed running on a treadmill at speeds up to 29mph which is one mph faster than the world's fastest man - Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. That beat the previous record of 13.1 set by a robot in 1999. Boston Dynamic's other robots aren't as fast but are designed to cover more treacherous terrain. Their collection includes both two- and four-legged robots that can climb walls and trees. A robot named 'WildCat' was designed to run fast on all types of terrain and was filmed galloping in a parking lot. The robot named Big Dog can climb a steep incline even in the snow, and is able to balance itself on slippery ice. Dr Raibert is the so-called 'father of walking robots' in the U.S. and started the Leg Lab at Carnegie Mellon University in 1980 to explore walking machines. He brought the lab to MIT before leaving academia to start engineering work for the miliatary and Sony. 'I am very excited by Andy and Google's ability to think very, very big, with the resources to make it happen,' he said.","Google recently purchase robotics company Boston Dynamics .

"A class of nursery school children in Russia has been photographed handling mock guns and grenades amid Western concerns over the country's alleged rising militarization as the crisis in Ukraine deepens. The pictures - which have sparked fury as well as admiration on the Russian web - were taken at a kindergarten in Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg. The image was photographed on 23 February, a day traditionally marked in the Soviet Union as Red Army Day. Scroll down for videos . A class of nursery school children in Russia has been photographed handling mock guns and grenades amid Western concerns over the country's alleged rising militarization as the crisis in Ukraine deepens . The pictures - which have sparked fury as well as admiration on the Russian web - were taken at a kindergarten in Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg . Now it is known as Defender of the Fatherland Day, a public holiday when Russians recall the extraordinary sacrifices made by soldiers in World War Two and other conflicts. The event involving the children - aged five and six - was organised by a father who serves in the Russian army. 'One of the parents is a military man, he decided to show some guns and weapons to the children on Defender of the Fatherland Day,' said Alexei Golovkin, co-ordinator of patriotic movement 'Resistance' in St Petersburg. He stepped in to support the father and the nursery after a wave of online protest. 'These dummies were shown to the children,' he said, denying web claims that the children had handled real weapons. 'The parents were not against this idea. They posted the pictures online.' The event involving the children - aged five and six - was organised by a father who serves in the Russian army . The children were shown and allowed to handle mock sniper rifles, Kalashnikov machine guns, and grenade-shooting guns as well as hand grenades . He stressed: 'I organise similar events in clubs for teenagers. When I was young we used sticks to play war games. 'If only I had a chance to hold such a toy when I was in the nursery, I think I would have wet my trousers from happiness.' He claimed the children's introduction to the weapons of war had nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis, in which the West accuses the Russian army of operating inside its neighbour's borders. 'It is just demonstration of the guns,' he said. The organiser of this event was not a 'defender' in Ukraine. The children were shown and allowed to handle mock sniper rifles, Kalashnikov machine guns, and grenade-shooting guns as well as hand grenades. The father behind the event was named as army major Vitaliy Statsenko, 31, but the kindergarten director was taken aback by hostile comments. Margarita Ivanova said: 'We could not even imagine an ordinary class about the profession of a military man will end like this. 'We organised it in the senior group of children. We asked every parent's permission, but we were surprised to see the pictures posted online, and some of the comments.' She was called to explain the event by the city's educational authorities but no punishment is being brought against her. One furious blogger wrote: 'Instead of saying 'thank you' they carpeted her. Who are they bringing up in these nurseries? Maybe gays and lesbians, like in the West?' 'This should be done regularly,' said another, 'and we will return to the good old times when young men dreamed of serving in the army, and young girls despised those who did not serve.' Another supporter said: 'Don't you see what kind of world we are living in now? Russia must be strong and these kids must be ready for all challenges.' Hostile comments included 'judging by this photo, they are bringing up killers', 'we are growing terrorists from nursery age' and 'if you want to teach patriotism in the nursery, do it with singing or dancing'.","Class of nursery school children in Russia pictured handling mock guns .

"Since militant group ISIS claimed to have established an Islamic caliphate, the city of Raqqa has become known as its fanatical capital. But reports from groups inside the city say there is growing resentment between the poor, who have been largely left to fend for themselves, and Islamic fighters, who live a life of five-star luxury. While fighters have each been given a pay-rise and a roast lamb to feast on for the festival of Eid al-Adha, the poor have been left to suffer as food an fuel prices spike. Scroll down for video . Good life: While Jihadi fighters have been pictured swimming in hotel pools and eating in upmarket restaurants around Raqqa, the city's residents have suffered under the new rule . Happy holiday: Fighters have each been given a pay bonus and lamb to feast on during Eid al-Adha, while in Raqqa may are now dependent on a few weathly benefactors who bankroll charities . Temptation: Extremists have posted images of their seemingly luxurious lifestyle on social media in the hope of tempting other Westerners to join them . Militants have been pictured dining out in five-star restaurants and soaking in hotel pools, while many citizens of Raqqa are now wholly dependent on the few wealthy citizens who still bankroll charities. Civilians hospitals have also been closed down as doctors abandon their posts, or run out of medical supplies, leaving people to travel to Turkey for medical help, with many dying along the way. Speaking to CBS, a source who used the fake name of Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi, said: 'As soon as they arrived, they became the elite of the community. 'They were given comfortable homes and cars -- and they get a generous salary every month. 'Recently, a bombing left many people, including fighters, badly hurt. 'We ran to help and saw ISIS trucks arrive and remove their men for treatment, leaving the civilians just lying there.' Suffering: Meanwhile the civilians of Raqqa have been left to suffer the ravages of spiraling food prices and hospitals closing down because of a lack of doctors . Destitute: While fighters have become wealthier under Islamic State rule, the city's poorest have become even poorer as they are largely left to fend for themselves . There are also reports of boys as young as 14 and 15 being snatched from their families and sent to training camps to become ISIS warriors. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims sources have spoken of growing unrest in the city between residents and their new leaders. Many have objected to the harsh punishments handed out by the Hesbah patrols, who have been brought into to enforce strict Sharia laws. Residents say that while they have turned a blind eye to manipulative traders hiking food and fuel prices, they mercilessly punish minor infringement such as smoking cigarettes. There has also been growing resentment against the al-Khansaa Brigade, a female patrol thought to contain several British jihadis, who patrol in disguise unlike their male counterparts.","Jihadi fighters have long boasted of five-style life while fighting for ISIS .

"A nurse in Germany who admits killing up to 30 patients by injecting them with heart medication so he could show off his resuscitation skills has been jailed for life. Nils H, was found guilty at Oldenburg Regional Court of two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder relating to his time working at a clinic in the German town of Delmenhorst. The 38-year-old, whose full name is being withheld under German privacy laws, was then told he would have to spend the rest of his life in jail. Nils. H. (pictured left concealing his face as he arrives for his trial) has been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of murder and attempted murder . It also emerged that he had previously been sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison in 2008 for attempted murder. Now, police are investigating claims he may actually be responsible for at least another 200 deaths at other clinics where he worked in Oldenburg and Wilhelmshaven. Earlier in the case, H told the court he brought about cardiac arrests in some 90 patients because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. He used Gilurytmal, a medication which should only be used by doctors under strict supervision, it was said and claimed 30 of these patients died. Prosecutors in the district court of Oldenburg said he was bored and wanted to practice his 'excellent' resuscitation skills. Prosecutors in the district court of Oldenburg said Nils. H. (pictured) was bored and wanted to practice his 'excellent' resuscitation skills. He reportedly 'expressed regret' for killing up to 30 patients . According to the prosecution, if the first attempt at resuscitation was a success, H would sometimes make a second attempt. Side effects of the drug he administered include an irregular heartbeat, a drop in blood pressure and uncoordinated functioning of the heart muscle. The death rate in the Delmenhorst clinic nearly doubled in the time H worked there, and use of the heart medication also increased dramatically. But it took nearly a decade before an investigation was launched, angering relatives of the dead who are demanding information. Though H. is facing charges in three murders and two attempted murders, the state prosecutor has said he could be involved in  up to 200 deaths . A senior doctor who gave evidence in September said H was a 'passionate medic' who made a good impression on staff at the clinic. But the doctor added: 'I found it strange that he was always on hand when patients were being resuscitated, often helping younger doctors with intubation - inserting a breathing tube into a patient's airways.' 'No one wants to believe that a colleague would rather kill patients, instead of helping them,' said Erich Joester, a lawyer for the clinic.","Nils H was found guilty of murder and attempted murder at a German court .

"No defence: James Clappison, MP for Hertsmere, highlighted the result of the cuts . The Royal Navy has 15 times more commanding officers than active warships, it has been revealed. Following crippling defence cuts, there are now 40 admirals and 260 captains but just 19 ships. The statistics were exposed by Tory MP James Clappison during a defence debate in the Commons yesterday. He highlighted the plight of the Navy by revealing there are now 13 captains for every destroyer and frigate, and about two admirals – who each earn more than £100,000 a year – per warship. He said: ‘In the past the dream of a captain in the Navy might have been to command his own ship. 'Today, it might be that dream is simply to set foot on a ship.’ Mr Clappison acknowledged that the Navy’s warships had state-of-the-art capabilities, but he warned that other nations, including China, were increasing naval spending at the same time as the Ministry of Defence was making cutbacks. To make £4.7billion savings and help eliminate a £38billion deficit in the equipment programme, the Navy is cutting its force by 5,000 sailors and four warships. He said: ‘It is important to ask if we have got the size of the Navy that could meet all the challenges that could be thrown at us. ‘The warships might well be more capable but they can only be in one place at a time.’ Stranded: Following crippling defence cuts, there are now 40 admirals and 260 captains but just 19 active war ships in the Navy .

"A judge has thrown out allegations made by a 'murdered' prosecutor that Argentina's president covered up Iranian involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre. The case against Cristina Kirchner was dismissed by Judge Daniel Rafecas who said documents filed by the late prosecutor Alberto Nisman failed to meet the standards needed to open a formal court investigation. Nisman had filed the complaint days before he died on January 18 under mysterious circumstances with polls showing that many Argentinians suspected officials had some hand in the death. President Kirchner called accusations against her 'absurd'. Iran has consistently denied involvement in the attack. Case dismissed: A judge has thrown out allegations made by a 'murdered' prosecutor that Argentina's president covered up Iranian involvement in a deadly 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires . Fatal: 85 people died in the explosion at a Jewish centre in Argentina's capital city on July 18, 1994 . President Kirchner had been under fire since Nisman was found dead in his Buenos Aires apartment on January 18. He accused her of protecting high-ranking Iranian officials from the deadly bombing which left 85 people dead in exchange for oil. Posecutor Gerardo Pollicita picked up the case after Nisman's death and accused Kirchner, Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and other government officials of mounting a cover-up and violating their duties,  a prosecution statement revealed. But the case has now been dismissed by a judge in Buenos Aires. Nisman, 51, was found in his Buenos Aires apartment with a gunshot wound to the head on January 18. Mysterious: The case's prosecutor Alberto Nisman - who accused the government of secret deals with Iran - died one day before he was due to answer questions in congress . It is still not known if he was murdered or not. His death at the age of 51 was initially labelled a suicide. The president later suggested he was manipulated by disgruntled former intelligence agents who killed him to smear her name. She branded Nisman's accusation that she conspired to whitewash his investigation 'absurd.' Earlier this month, 61-year-old Kirchner used her Facebook page to deny the allegations and urged her citizens to look at the positives in Argentina. She wrote: 'You know what? Let’s forget about the hatred, the pain, the insults, the false accusations. 'We have the AUH [an education loan for children of low-income families], pensions, same-sex marriage, more and more human rights, the highest minimum wage in history, nationalized industries, investments in infrastructure, education, universities, scientists, schools and children.'","Gerardo Pollicita had taken up the case against president Kirchner, 61 .

"The term ‘GM food’ should be abandoned, say politicians who are calling for an extraordinary rebranding exercise. MPs on the science and technology select committee has demanded a ‘reframing of the public conversation’ about genetically modified food. In an inflammatory report today, it says the GM label has become a ‘lightning rod’ for fears about designer crops. Biohazard: MPs on the science and technology select committee say GM crops, like this field of GM wheat, should be rebranded because the term has become a ‘lightning rod’ for fears about designer crops . It says the term should be reserved for plants created using the most basic form of genetic engineering, with many newer methods excluded. Anti-GM groups accused MPs of trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the public. Peter Melchett, of the Soil Association, who gave evidence to the committee during its inquiry, said: ‘This is probably the most ridiculous recommendation to come out of any select committee in this entire Parliament. It’s insulting to the public to suggest they can be fooled that easily.’ Some fear that ‘Frankenfoods’ could alter ecosystems and have hidden effects on human health. No GM food has ever been commercially grown in Britain, kept out by a labyrinthine EU system that makes it difficult to get the required environmental licences. But UK scientists and farmers have been campaigning for years to make the process easier. The latest report repeats their calls and urges the Government to change its terminology. It says: ‘GM . . . is now often used imprecisely to encompass a whole range of technologies. We recommend that the Government initiate a reframing of the public conversation by moving away from the overly simple notion of “GM” in its policies and communications.’ The authors say the term GM should only be used to describe ‘first-generation’ techniques – in which genes are taken out of one plant and moved into another. Biologists can now work on a much finer level, editing individual strands of a plant’s DNA. Too perfect? A farmer compares two corncobs of Montsanto's genetically engineered corn, right, with two normal corncobs on a field near the village of Badingen north of Berlin, in this 2007 file photo . The report claims the label GM ‘fails to accurately portray’ these more modern techniques. It adds: ‘The term “GM” has become a lightning rod for much broader public anxiety . . . There is a need to reframe and widen the public debate to encourage a more productive conversation.’ Labour MP Andrew Miller, who chairs the committee, accused anti-GM groups of propagating ‘false claims’ and ‘misleading statements regarding safety’. He said: ‘The scientific evidence is clear that crops developed using genetic modification pose no more risk to humans, animals or the environment than equivalent crops developed using more “conventional” techniques.’ Yesterday George Eustice, the Tory farming minister, told the National Farmers Union conference in Birmingham that there was a need to have a ‘grown-up conversation’ about GM, adding: ‘We should be growing these crops, and we shouldn’t allow non-scientific arguments to muddy the debate.’ But Liz O’Neill, of the campaign group GM Freeze, insisted the proposal was ludicrous. ‘Arguing about the semantics is just a smokescreen,’ she said. ‘All of the crops that are currently producing food and all the ones waiting in line within the EU approvals process are first-generation GM. ‘Looking at what’s coming out of the lab, it is vital to remember any attempt to artificially engineer DNA can cause unexpected and unpredictable effects.’","Critic says its 'insulting to the public to suggest they can be fooled'

Marta said the video recordings showed that Schaefer and Mack used the emergency stairs several times to go between the third and sixth floors. Mack and her mother were staying in a room on the third floor, while Schaefer was staying on the sixth floor. 'The man walked up and down from the third to the sixth floor, changed his shirt once and brought a white cloth,' he said.

"The teenage daughter of one of Australia's richest men has successfully challenged her father's will in court after claiming she is entitled to a $2.5 million house, a $100,000 wedding, a diamond encrusted grand piano and two cars. Olivia Jacqueline Mead, 19, won a claim to $25 million dollars, an increase from the $3 million trust fund originally left to her when her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright died in 2012. Ms Mead claimed that the amount left to her from her father's estimated worth of $1 billion was insufficient and would not be able to provide her with advancement in life, reported Nine News. Olivia Jacqueline Mead, 19, won a claim to $25 million dollars, an increase from the $3 million trust left to her by mining magnate Michael Wright . The 19-year-old told the Western Australian Supreme Court that she needed a home five times the Perth median price ($2.5 million), $10,000 each year for fashion accessories including Tiffany and Co sunglasses and $100,000 for a wedding when she ties the knot. Her list of claims also included an Audi A4 and a Toyota Tarago for when she has children, as well as a diamond-encrusted bass guitar worth $250,000 and a limited ­edition Kuhn Bosendorfer grand piano. In a summons filed in December 2012, Ms Mead also claimed to have been left without adequate funds for her proper maintenance, support, education and advancement in life from her father's estate in the bequeath to be held in trust until she was 30. On Thursday, Master Craig Sanderson of the Western Australian Supreme Court agreed, saying Mr Wright did not make adequate provision for his youngest child from his 'colossal' estate. 'The deceased had a vast fortune and he was in the fortunate position of being able to provide for all of the parties who had a claim on his bounty,' Master Sanderson said. While the 19-year-old had been included in the trust, the structure meant that Ms Mead might have received very little as the will stated that she could receive 'up to' $3 million. The judge also found that the will had been worded in an 'unwieldy' way, and that her fate was in the hands of the executor of the will, David Lemon, whom Ms Mead had never met, and whom had close ties with other family members. Master Sanderson found the situation 'unreasonable', and said that the will 'could operate in an entirely oppressive fashion', potentially excluding her as a beneficiary if she was convicted of a drink driving offence. Olivia Jacqueline Mead, 19, claimed that a $3 million trust fund left to her when her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright (pictured) died in 2012 is inadequate . Ms Mead, pictured outside the Western Australia Supreme Court on Thursday, won $25 million of the estate . Ms Mead was suing her two half-sisters who had already been awarded $400 million of their father's estate . 'It may even be the case if she was suspected of involvement with someone who used an illicit substance she could be excluded,' he said. One of the clauses of the will stated that  if the plaintiff converted to Buddhism, or perhaps Islam - or even was associated with someone who practised those faiths - she would be an 'excluded person'. Master Sanderson found the clause 'an extraordinary proposition' and that she would have to give up her Australian birthright of freedom of religion. Master Sanderson said the $25 million should be paid to Ms Mead in a lump sum. The rest of the estate will pass to Ms Mead's half-sisters, Leonie Baldock and Alexandra Burt, who will get about $10 million each minus about $1 million for legal costs. Ms Mead is now suing her father's other two children - Leonie Baldock and ­Alexandra Burt - and the executor of her father's will, David Lemon. The matter was heard in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on Monday . 'That is on top of the $400 million they already have and they can rest easy in the knowledge their half-sister will be financially secure for the rest of her life,' he said. Mr Wright was estimated to be worth $1.5 billion when he died at 74 and was the son of Peter Wright, who co-founded Hancock Prospecting and Wright Prospecting with Lang Hancock - Gina Rinehart's father. The late mining heir was married four times and fathered three children, two of whom are involved in the Western ­Australia family business. Ms Mead is now suing her father's other two children  - Leonie Baldock and ­Alexandra Burt - and the executor of her father's will, David Lemon. Ms Mead claimed in court she will need $300 a week for utilities, $800 a week for food and alcohol, $150 a week for fine wine and $300 a week for clothing. The university student, who appeared in court on Monday, said her relationship with her father was 'sporadic'. The defendants in the matter are executor David  Lemon, Leonie Angela Maynard Baldock, Alexandra Odette Burt and VOC Group Ltd. Ms Baldock, who is also Mr Wright's daughter, took over the reins at Wright Prospecting shortly after he died when she was aged 40. The VOC Group is related to the Voyager Estate winery in Margaret River bought by Mr Wright - who was reportedly not a drinker - in 1991.","Olivia Mead, daughter of the late Michael Wright, won a claim to $25 million .

"As many as 40 Australian women are being groomed to become 'jihadi brides' for Islamic State militants fighting in the Middle East, where they were forced into becoming sex slaves or suicide bombers. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told parliament on Wednesday one-fifth of foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq were now women. She said 30 to 40 of these women were thought to be Australians who were supporting or engaging in terrorist activity. Scroll down for video . Amira Karroum, a former Gold Coast girl, is thought to have travelled to Syria to fight for Islamic State and has since died . Julie Bishop has revealed up to 40 Australian women have joined Islamic State in the Middle East . 'Young women are joining Daesh [Islamic State], yet they are being exploited in the most appalling way,' Ms Bishop said. 'They are being used by men who know nothing but hate, used as sexual slaves, manipulated for propaganda and recruitment purposes and in some cases ending their lives as suicide bombers. 'Many are being radicalised online, seduced by slick exploitation of social media to spread Daesh's depraved narrative.' The comments come after ASIO director-general Duncan Lewis confirmed the overwhelming majority of Australians who had returned home after fighting in Syria and Iraq did so more than two years ago. 'I can say that the vast majority of those 30 returned to Australia before there was even an ISIL [also known as IS], before the caliphate was declared,' Mr Lewis said. Some had been fighting for different sides in the Syrian civil war. Australian jihadi Mohamed Elomar is just one of Islamic State militants in Syria who have been accused of trying to recruit people . She said they were being exploited and used as sex slaves or suicide bombers for terrorist group . Khaled Sharrouf (right) is another Australian who is known as an Islamic State fighter . Mr Lewis refused to detail the breakdown of numbers in terms of those who had returned in the past two years. The 30 who had returned presented varying degrees of threat to the community, and were included in a 'matrix' that evaluates and prioritises the seriousness of the cases. 'We do not have a watchlist as such,' Mr Lewis said. 'We manage... the threat that is presented and the prioritising of that threat and then the attention that is given to that particular threat.' The increase in women joining or supporting IS was a 'relatively recent phenomenon'. It has been reported that some of the women were fighting for Islamic State, but that others were being traded as sex slaves in Syria and Iraq. Two weeks ago, it was reported several Australian women who had gone to Syria had now become slaves of the terrorist group after their partners were killed. The terrorist group has released a series of a recipes to help wives of jihadists look after their husbands. Above are the ingredients to make pancakes - flour, one egg, a teaspoon of salt and milk . The recipe instructs cooks to put all the ingredients in a bowl and stir them up . Cooks are then told to pour a little oil into the pan and warm to a medium hear, before pouring in the pancake mixture. When the pancake starts bubbling it should be flipped over . Once brown on both sides the pancake is ready to be served. Militants suggest dishing it up with maple syrup or honey . Ms Bishop cited the case of 22-year-old Amira Karroum, who was a former Gold Coast girl, who fled to the Middle East just before Christmas and died in fighting in Syria. 'Her death was not martyrdom, it was a tragic senseless loss,' she said. The government is looking at ways to counter Islamic State propaganda after it was revealed terrorists are serving up pancake recipes online to win over new followers. A national security review report has revealed terror groups such as Islamic State are using 'highly targeted messages to appeal to vulnerable audiences'. The report gives the example of IS releasing a pancake recipe 'designed to feed jihadists after a hard day of fighting'. A rough translation of the recipe website says the pancakes are quickly and easily prepared and best eaten with honey. 'Can supply to mujahideen [fighters] before scurrying out onto the fighting fronts and extend the mujahideen energy and power, God willing. 'Serve them to heroes.' The ingredients needed for power and strength increasing 'date balls' include dates, butter and flour . Terrorist wives  are told to take the pips out of the dates and melt the butter . Take the remains of the dates and add the butter then combine with the flour . Cooks then need to role the mixture into the tiny balls before they are ready for their IS fighter husbands . Prime Minister Tony Abbott detailed the terror groups' ploys on Monday during a landmark national security address. IS has also released a guidebook to help young mothers raise a 'Mujahid child'. 'Don't wait until they are seven to start, for it may be too late by then,' it says. The federal government is looking at ways to counter such propaganda, in consultation with Islamic communities. Islamic State first issued the pancake recipes in 2014 along with a recipe for balls of date mush. They instructed the pancakes should be made with egg, sugar, oil, salt, milk and flour. IS have published cartoon videos aimed at encouraging more women to join their cause . The group strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour' Militants are told that the date balls are best eaten during an 'intermission in battle' with coffee or water. 'They contain significant calories, and will extend the power and strength of the Mujahideen, God willing,' the post says. The cookbook was published by the Zora Foundation, an arm of IS that is seeking to recruit women to the cause, and give advice to those already in Syria and Iraq. Their slogan is 'preparing for the honour of jihad' and their online accounts - which post only in Arabic - have attracted thousands of followers so far. IS strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour'. Among the suitable tasks given to women is producing and editing slideshows and film footage, in an effort to make more propaganda, and participating in 'jihadi science' - which is not explained further.","Julie Bishop revealed 30 to 40 Australian women were fighting in Syria .

"Contamination of chicken with a potentially lethal food poisoning bug is getting worse, new evidence revealed today. The proportion of fresh roasting chickens on supermarket shelves carrying campylobacter is up from 70 per cent to 72.9 per cent . At the same time, the number considered highly contaminated rose from 18 per cent to 18.9 per cent, according to figures from the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Simply picking up chickens from a shelf to check the price is also a risk, the FSA warned. It found the proportion of packs contaminated on the outside rose from 6 per cent to 6.8 per cent - or one in 14 packs. Danger: The proportion of fresh roasting chickens on supermarket shelves carrying campylobacter is up from 70 per cent to 72.9 per cent. The bug is Britain’s most common cause of food poisoning . The increase compared to November figures suggest that supermarkets, farmers and processors are not doing enough to protect customers. An estimated 280,000 people fall ill and 100 people die every year because of campylobacter, which is Britain’s most common cause of food poisoning. The FSA says the resulting cost to the UK in terms of NHS treatment and lost productivity due to people being off work sick is a staggering £900 million. The figures come as a European study published today warned about the emergence of new ‘superbug’ versions of campylobacter, which are resistant to antibiotic medicines. As a result, doctors find it increasingly difficult to treat people who fall ill after handling and eating chicken. The FSA says it expects stores to reduce the number of birds that are highly contaminated to no more than 10 per cent by the end of the year. If this target is met - which seems unlikely - the FSA claims it would reduce the number of food poisoning cases by 84,000 and save around 30 lives a year. Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, described the situation as ‘scandalous’. The professor, who has studied campylobacter for 25 years, called for urgent action from stores and the government to protect shoppers. An estimated 280,000 people fall ill and 100 people die every year because of campylobacter, which is Britain’s most common cause of food poisoning. The FSA says the resulting cost to the UK in terms of NHS treatment and lost productivity due to people being off work sick is a staggering £900 million. The FSA figures show that Asda came out worst on virtually every measure with a contamination level of 78.9per cent and 31.1per cent at the highest level. By contrast, Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Waitrose saw a fall in the number of birds with the highest contamination. ‘We have legislation to prevent harmful substances in our houses such as asbestos, yet we are happy to allow more than two out three chickens into our kitchens that can cause severe diarrhoea and in some cases can be life threatening,’ he said. ‘It has to be stopped at source and poultry needs to be campylobacter-free, which could be achieved through vaccinating flocks. Supermarkets and government agencies need to take responsibility.’ Professor Wren said a number of vaccines are in development and this work must be accelerated with funding from the government, the industry and, potentially, supermarkets. The FSA figures show that Asda came out worst on virtually every measure with a contamination level of 78.9 per cent and 31.1 per cent at the highest level. By contrast, Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Waitrose saw a fall in the number of birds with the highest contamination. Dr Andreas Karatzas, a food microbiologist at the University of Reading, said contamination on the outside of packs is a real threat. ‘It is particularly concerning that so many chickens are being sold with bacteria on the outside of the packaging. 'This hugely increases the risk of cross-contamination to other food in your supermarket trolley or your fridge,’ he said. Concern: The figures come as a European study published today warned about the emergence of new ‘superbug’ versions of campylobacter (pictured), which are resistant to antibiotic medicines . The FSA today praised M&S for leading the way in tackling the bug. The store has moved to selling chickens in ‘cook in the bag’ packs, paying farmers a bonus if they keep their flocks bug-free, and blast or rapid chilling the birds in an attempt to kill campylobacter. The store’s own most recent survey covering found the proportion of birds contaminated at the highest levels was down to just three per cent in January. Mr Wearne said: ‘We warmly welcome what M&S is doing. It shows that one retailer can achieve the target through a programme of systematic interventions and we think others can, and should, do the same.’ Asda said it has introduced new measures to protect consumers, however these will take time to deliver results. The majority of its chickens are now being sold as ‘roast in the bag’ and it is looking at treating carcasses with Sonostream, which uses steam and ultrasound to kill the bug. Mr Wearne added: ‘Campylobacter is killed by thorough cooking, but it should not be left to consumers to manage the risk. 'It is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK, affecting an estimated 280,000 people a year. ‘Poultry is the source of the majority of these cases, so the industry should be making every effort to ensure chickens are as free from campylobacter as possible before they reach customers. Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which?, said: ‘It’s unacceptable that we're still seeing such high and rising levels of campylobacter in chicken. 'People need reassurance that supermarkets are doing everything they can to make chicken safe. ‘This problem requires everyone in the food chain, from farmers, to supermarkets, and consumers, to improve practices if we want to cut infection rates.’ Mike Catchpole, chief scientist at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, said doctors are finding it increasingly difficult to treat people infected with superbug versions of campylobacter, which are resistant to antibiotic medicines such as fluoroquinolones. ‘The high levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones observed in campylobacter isolates - from both humans and chickens - are of concern, considering that a large proportion of human campylobacter infections come from handling, preparation and consumption of chicken meat,’ he said. ‘Such high resistance levels reduce the effective treatment options for severe human campylobacter infections.’ The FSA Director of Policy, Steve Wearne, said the onus is on stores to reduce the number of birds that carry high contamination to under 10 per cent by the end of 2015. He admitted the watchdog has no legal powers to punish stores that miss the target, however he said they would be held to account by customers. ‘Time is running out for the industry to take action to meet the target,’ he said.","72.9% of fresh roasting chickens are carrying campylobacter, says FSA .

"The Denver police are finally ready to admit they screwed up by letting an officer receive 40 complaints over nine years on the force--one of which involved him nearly beating a disabled veteran to death--without ever really being punished. Despite having once broken a man's knee cap following a verbal altercation and beating the veteran so badly he flatlined on the street, Officer Shawn Miller never received a punishment that lasted more than two days. In fact, he wasn't punished at all for nearly killing the veteran. However, it may soon cost his employers and the taxpayers of Denver $860,000 for the 2008 incident, reports 7 News Denver. 'We failed': Shawn Miller, the Denver cop seen here harassing an apartment buiilding resident after she hesitated before buzzing him into a building, received 40 complaints over the course of 9 years. Seventeen of them cited excessive force and none resulted in a punishment that lasted over two days . Off the hook: The incident caught on this surveillance camera was one of the few that resulted in suspension for Miller. He wasn't punished at all in 2008 after he beat a disabled veteran so badly he flatlined on the street . That's in addition to the $225,000 the city paid out to Jason Graber, who suffered the broken knee cap in 2011 after he yelled to a speeding Miller to slow down on a Denver street. The Denver Police Department now calls these incidents, and the 38 other complaints made against Miller over the years--17 of which cited excessive force--'warning signs.' 'The warning signs were being flashed at us,' DPD spokesman Matt Murray told 7 News Denver. 'The problem is what we did with them after we got the warning signs.' What they did, in nearly every case, was absolutely nothing. Miller's performance resulted in an automatic review 10 tens between 2007 and 2010, 7 News reports. Each time, Miler's supervisors recommend no response to the alleged infraction. Paying the price: Jason Graber (pictured) suffered a broken kneecap in 2011 after he yelled at a speeding Miller to slow down. Miller exited his cruiser and the beating followed a verbal altercation with Graber, who's since won a $225,000 settlement . Murray admits: . 'We didn't follow through in a way to help correct his behavior to prevent a situation where what we're facing now, where we have liability on the city and liability on the department.' Now, as police and that disabled veteran, James Moore, near an agreement that could pay out as much as $860,000 in damages, that failure to act could soon cost the city in excess of a million bucks. Moore says in a federal lawsuit that he was 'hog tied,' beaten and clubbed by officers Shawn Miller and James Robledo in 2008 after they responded to a noise complaint at his Denver apartment. He accused the pair of attacking him without provocation after he asked them what was going on. Heft pricetag: 'The warning signs were being flashed at us,' DPD spokesman Matt Murray admits. 'The problem is what we did with them after we got the warning signs.' Now the city is reportedly close to offering a disabled veteran who Miller nearly killed an settlement that could exceed $800,000. Pictured is the downtown headqaurters of the Denver police . The officers 'beat Mr. Moore with such brutality while he was helpless on the ground that he lost consciousness, his heart stopped beating and paramedics or law enforcement officers had to administer CPR to save his life,' the complaint said. Lane said Miller has been the target of more than three dozen citizen complaints, and that he has been sued in federal court at least three times. 'Shawn Miller is one of the most violent officers on the Denver force and should not only be fired but prosecuted,' the lawyer said. Murray told Reuters in early February that Miller has never had an excessive force complaint against him upheld after each of the cases was reviewed by the city's independent police monitor. 'I'm not defending or indicting him (Miller), but you have to look at the facts of each case,' Murray said of Miller. After the Moore case is finalized, the department will open up Miller's entire complaint file for the public to see, the commander added. Power trip: The accusations against Miller have now reached a breaking point as the city of Denver nears a settlement that could put the cost of Miller's excessive force at over $1M to taxpayers. Here, Miller speaks to a shopkeeper who called police to report he was being harassed and who Miller subsequently handcuffed .","Officer Shawn Miller has received dozens of complaints in his 9 years with the department but never punished more than two days .

"They may be described as the 'wolves of the sea', but it turns out that the killer whale is more closely related to the cow than the predatory canine. A new study has also revealed that walruses may actually be more deserving of the majestic title than the orca that hunt them. Genetic analysis of three species of marine mammal has also revealed that the gentle manatee - often called the sea cow - is more closely related to elephants. Killer whales (left) may be known as the 'wolves of the sea' but are genetically more similar to cows (right) The research shows that killer whales and cows share a common ancestor while walruses share one with dogs and manatees evolved from the ancestors of elephants. They may not appear to be related, but hippos have long been thought to share an ancient ancestor with whales. Now researchers have uncovered the 28 million-year-old molars of an ancestor of the hippo that has finally provided direct proof of their link with whales. Palaeontologists at France's University of Montpellier say the long extinct relative of hippos came from a group of plant eating, semi-aquatic mammals with even toed hooves called anthracothere. They have named the new species Epirigenys lokonensis - 'epiri' means hippo in the Turkana language and Lokone after the discovery site. Until now, the oldest known fossil of a hippo ancestor dated from about 20 million years ago, while cetacean remains aged 53 million years have been found. Scientists say the new fossil suggests hippos could be the closest living relative of whales left on the land. It suggests mammals returned to the sea on several occasions during their evolutionary history and then separately evolved similar physiological traits - a process known as convergent evolution. Andrew Foote, a researcher at the centre for geogenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen, who led the study, that despite all looking similar, sea mammals were surprisingly different genetically. Speaking to Danish newspaper Videnskab, he said: 'From the outside these animals look alike, but they are radically different on a genetic level.' Mammals are thought to have first started returning to the sea around 60 million years ago as land mammals started moving into shallow marine environments to feed. Scientists have long thought that mammals invaded the oceans in two pushes - once in the early Eocene, about 56 million years ago - leading to whales, dolphins and manatees. The second push came in the Oligocene about 30 million years ago led to seals and walruses. However, the new research suggests prehistoric land mammals may have invaded the oceans on other occasions too. The researchers compared the genomes of killer whales, walruses and manatees with those of dogs, cows and elephants. They may not look alike, but the walrus on the left has a shared ancestor with the grey wolf on the right . They analysed the genomes to find out which parts had undergone major changes since the species separated from common ancestors millions of years ago. Their study, which is published in the journal Nature Genetics, showed that surprisingly the marine mammals were genetically quite different. Indeed, the killer whales were found to share more of their genome with cows than with their marine cousins while walruses were closer to the dog family. The findings suggests that walruses and seals share a common ancestor with modern wolves and dogs while orca evolved from a shared ancestor with the more docile cow. Manatees (pictured left0 share their genetic evolution with the largest mammal on land, the elephant (right) It means that the nickname given to killer whales - wolves of the sea - due to their highly predatory tendencies and ability to hunt in packs, may have to be revised. Indeed walruses often fall prey to killer whales, but may be more deserving of the title. Manatees, which are large, slow moving herviorous mammals that live in the shallow coastal waters of the Carribean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. Fossilised remains of ancient manatees have been found around Florida that date back 45 million years. Dr Foote and his colleagues, however, have now found that manatees are more closely related to the largest land mammal on the planet - the elephant. It is thought that they split from elephants around 60 million years ago. Although elephants are land mammals, they are known to swim and use their trunks as snorkels as above . Dr Foote said: 'Surprisingly, we found an unexpectedly high level of convergence along the combined branches of the terrestrial sister taxa - cow, dog and elephant - to the marine mammals.' The study showed that the three species of marine mammal had undergone what is known as genetic substitutions in their DNA. The scientists found just 15 genes that appear to have been affected by these substitutions, suggesting they the different species had evolved the corresponding physiological traits separately. This means that their similar topedo-shaped bodies and tail shaped hindlimbs were shaped side-by-side by the ecological demands of living in the ocean rather than a common ancestor. Killer whales are highly intelligent and hunt in packs (as above) which has led to comparisons with wolves . Among these were gene substitutions that play a role in bone formation that the scientists believe may have helped early shallow diving species such as the manatee and walrus to overcome neutral buoyancy. Similarly they said changes to the same genes could have allowed deep diving species to overcome this buoyancy. Other changes may be involved in heart beat regulation during diving and making blood more viscoius to increase the amount of oxygen it can carry to muscles. Dr Foote told Videnskab: 'We were certain that for the tail and fins we'd see convergent evolution in the same genes, however, we did not. 'The animals had found other genetic pathways to achieve the same physiological result.'","Scientists at the University of Copenhagen compared the genomes of killer whales, walruses and manatees with those of dogs, cows and elephants .
Killer whales - which are nicknamed the wolves of the sea - were found to share more of their genes with cows than the other species of mammal .
Walruses were shown to have more in common with dogs and wolves .
Manatees, also called sea cows, were most closely related to elephants .

"Etiquette expert William Hanson claims politicians should not brag about their conquests . Yet another example of ‘over-sharing’ has come to our attention. This time from the new Casanova of the Commons, shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Speaking to LBC, the Labour politician responded to a new survey that has found him to be one of the supposed best lovers in parliament; he explained that he was a ‘long, slow lover’ in bed. As to why the Shadow Chancellor thought anyone would like to know these intimate details as to what he does with his… well… balls is the operative question. He may be Christian Gray incarnate once the (always rather generous) suit comes off but as one of our elected representatives just, as voters, we don’t want to know. Yet over-sharing our conquests now seems to be the done thing and whereas once a gentleman would never have kissed and told, now you are a nobody if you don’t broadcast the news on radio stations, or, on a more domestic level, on social media or loudly to a your friend in a coffee shop, with who knows how many people unwittingly privy to the details of the cut and thrust. I wrote a few weeks ago about chivalry being on life support due to ‘wimmin’ but it is also due to the continuing lapses in common sense and decency of men that too has contributed to the long, slow murder of chivalry. The survey as to who would be the best lover in the House of Commons was issued by everyone’s favourite parenting website Mumsnet (who clearly still have too much time on their hands if they are wasting time and money commissioning pointless surveys like this and forgetting to get on with actually raising their children). It’s not just dim politicos that have failed to get over the need to brag about their conquests. We were (rightly) aghast when in 2011 one of that year’s X Factor wannabes Frankie Cocozza flashed his flabby bottom on our screens with each of his Spanish notches tattooed across his posterior; the only thing worse than the ink itself was the smug sense of accomplishment on the hopeful’s face. Ed Balls, pictured left, and right with wife and Labour MP Yvette Cooper confessed to being a 'love, slow lover' during an interview about a Mumsnet survey on LBC radio . An intimate act is exactly that – something that happens in our private life, although clearly these lives are now not as private as they should be. I put this over-sharing about our sex lives in the same bracket as public displays of affection: any affection, whether a kiss on the lips, a cuddle or more, is something special to be shared with the two people involved. Showing it off to others, physically or verbally, devalues it, cheapens the act and the people involved. At least with a PDA the ‘showing off’ is consensual, whereas the over-sharing of what goes once in the bedroom is more often not. How does Yvette Cooper feel about her Mr Dynamo discussing this in such a public fashion? I doubt it will lead to further ‘long, slow’ sessions in the coming weeks. But, politicians have been trying pathetically to be our friends since the 1997 election campaign. No longer can then just be satisfied with getting on with running the country but they must pander to their own insecurities and be ‘liked’ as well. Do they think we care? Maybe the now Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg only got to where he is today by announcing in 2008 that he has slept with around 30 women? One surge in his polls too many causing his electability to blossom, perhaps. Former premier Tony Blair won the bad sex award for a particularly churning description of sex with Cherie – I will not reprint it here. Again, why he felt the need to let us all know what the couple were like behind the closed black shiny door is a good question. Power attracts, we know that, but real power doesn’t need to reveal cheap details in attempts to get our own juices flowing. That said, we should have seen this revelation coming: how many days until the election from today? 69… . When to ‘put out’ Anyone worth entering into a loving and fruitful relationship with won’t ‘put out’ (awful phrase) on the first date, and not really the second. The norm now is that something may happen on the third date, although this is largely the accepted standard in America that thanks to the Friends generation has been adopted worldwide. We Brits used to keep our legs crossed and swords sheathed a bit longer than the third date. Keep your mouth shut . Telling one or two close and trusted friends how your date went is understandable but chose your time and place. The coffee shop may be a good venue to catch up on news but the nice elderly couple to your left, who had been enjoying their extra wet Americanos, need not know of your extra hot exploits. You can refuse to answer . Don’t feel pressured into talking about something that is going to make you feel uncomfortable. If a friend asks you, perhaps misjudging the moment, then you are perfectly at liberty to not answer, or instead deploy a cunning euphemism that may satisfy their thirst for gossip but spare you from being tempted to go into details. That awkward moment when… . Think about it – it’s been six months since you made it official with your former date and now boy/girlfriend. You’re both at a dinner party hosted by your friend who, after one or two many helpings of a Sémillon, lets slip some intimate detail that they had forgotten you had told them seven months ago whilst you were using sex chat as a means to bond with them… How do you think your special one will feel? Wanted? Loved? Like she’s bagged a real gent? Think again… . William Hanson is author of The Bluffer's Guide To Etiquette.","William Hanson says voters don't want to know about MPs' love lives .

"A 22-year-old woman has been accused of arranging an armed shakedown of her ex-boyfriend   because he cheated on her. Sarah Matherly was identified locally as the alleged organizer of a stick-up scheme targeting her ex-boyfriend, Daniel Szwadjer. Szwadjer has claimed he was attacked and robbed in a Hollywood, Florida motel room - and that Matherly also tried to force him to give her more money in a second incident. Suspect: Sarah Matherly, left, has been accused of leading a robbery against her ex-boyfriend Daniel Szwadja, right, because he was unfaithful to her . Citing an arrest report, WPLG reported that Szwajder was instructed by Matherly to visit her at a motel. However, two men were there lurking in wait. According to the television station, Szwajder told authorities he was placed in a choke hold by a man who said: 'You know what this is. Give me everything.' At the same time, Matherly reportedly entered a bathroom. Referring to the arrest report, WPLG said Szwajder claimed he was held at gunpoint by the second man and handed over $46, a debit card, a wallet, an identification card and a gold chain. Szwajder claimed Matherly said in a phone call 'That's what you get for cheating on me' following the holdup, the television station reported. Szwadjer reportedly told authorities that his ex-girlfriend warned if he failed to hand over more money she would 'send these guys over to your mom's house'. Szwajder identified a man from the first incident when he went to the designated spot, kept going in his car and contacted authorities, according to WPLG. NBC 6 South Florida reported that Matherly faces charges of extortion and robbery with a firearm. Broward Judge John Hurley ordered that she be held on $7,500 bond, the television station reported. Hurley reportedly mandated Matherly submit to weekly drug tests upon getting released, and that she must either return to school or find an occupation. According to NBC 6 South Florida, a lawyer for Matherly said the 22-year-old knew nothing of the holdup, having been in a different room. A Facebook profile for Matherly says she graduated from Western High School in 2010.

The animals galloped along the sidewalk, through manicured yards and along street medians . The streets looked more like a rodeo arena as several people tried to lasso both llamas. Their televised breakout quickly inspired a Twitter account and several hashtags including #LlamasonTheLoose, #llamadrama and #TEAMLLAMAS. Someone also started a Twitter account with the handle @SunCityLlamas. The user tweeted that the idea was inspired by someone starting an account for a bear that caused a frenzy by running around the Phoenix suburb of Mesa on Christmas Day. The animal was captured days later. The llamas thwarted numerous attempts by Maricopa County sheriff's deputies and bystanders to round them up before they were roped into custody. The black llama was captured first. The white one was nabbed after two men in the back of a moving pickup truck repeatedly threw out a lasso. It took three men in all to secure the rope. Both animals were escorted to a waiting horse trailer. The entire ordeal lasted about an hour. It was unknown if the llamas were anyone's pets. The black llama was lassoed first, leaving the white llama to roam the streets alone for a short while . The runaway llamas quickly caused a stir on social media with several hashtags including, #LlamasonTheLoose and one person linking their escape to shamed news anchor Brian Williams .","Two quick-footed llamas darted through the streets of Sun City, Arizona, on Thursday afternoon .

"Police have launched a hunt for poachers who beheaded 100 deer and left the remains scattered across woodland in Spain. Horrified ramblers in the Castile and Leon region of central Spain stumbled upon the macabre sight during an afternoon stroll. Sickened walker Narela Hinojosa, 37, said: 'It was like something out of a horror film. Police have launched a hunt for poachers who beheaded 100 deer and left the remains scattered across woodland in the Castile and Leon region of central Spain (pictured) 'We came to a clearing in the forest and just saw all these heads and bodies littered all over the place. 'I nearly vomited, it was so gross and the smell was unbearable. 'Most of the heads had antlers missing and some of the carcasses had no legs. 'It looked like a massacre had taken place.' Now animal rights groups have vowed to have the people responsible brought to justice. A spokesman for the Nature Protection Service, a public organisation responsible for nature and the environment, said: 'Preliminary investigations suggest the animals were trapped in snow and weakened by lack of food. 'Hunters took advantage of this and killed them before chopping them up. 'We also have reports from locals saying they had seen people driving cars full of deer heads. 'It is not the first time in these mountains that poachers have taken advantage of the snow and killed animals that are tired and hungry. 'But we have never seen it on this scale before. This type of hunting is illegal and forbidden as the animals have no chance of escape.' Horrified ramblers  stumbled upon the macabre sight during an afternoon stroll . A police spokesman said they were now trying to trace the poachers. A local huntsman Melito Muro Manzanares, 49, said: 'They call themselves hunters but this isn't hunting. 'It is poaching at its most barbaric and it brings the sport a bad name. Keeping down the numbers of deer is important for the environment, but it needs to be done at the right time of year, and in the right way.'","Police in Spain have launched a hunt for poachers who massacred deer .

"A suburban Detroit couple who have two older children are adjusting to life after becoming parents to identical triplets — a one-in-a-million birth. The Whiteley family of St. Clair Shores celebrated the one month birthdays Wednesday for Alexander, Nicholas and Timothy. The brothers were born January 25 at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, but spent nearly a month in the newborn intensive care unit. The boys are healthy, their mother Lauren Whiteley said. Their older brothers are age 3 and 2. Scroll down for video . A miracle times three: The Whiteley family of St. Clair Shores celebrated the one-month birthdays Wednesday for identical; triplets Alexander, Nicholas and Timothy . 'I always wanted a big family, and I guess this is the way to do it, get them all at once,' Whiteley joked. Many triplets are the result of fertility treatments, but Lauren Whiteley, 32, said she didn't take fertility drugs. She had an ultrasound at about eight or nine weeks to confirm the pregnancy, but didn't know what she was seeing. 'It was the ultrasound tech that kind of left the room, came back and I thought something was wrong,' Whiteley said. 'She said ""No it's good news."" I said ""Oh my gosh! It's twins, isn't it?"" She said, ""No, I see three."" This was the shock of a lifetime.' New parents: Michael and Lauren Whiteley, from left, check on their identical triplets Alexander, Timothy and Nicholas at their home on Wednesday . All snuggled up!: The boys were born at 34 weeks via C-section on January  25 naturally, without fertility drugs and without a history of twins in the family . Michael Whiteley, 31, said he asked his wife several times: 'Triplets? Are you sure?' It was very overwhelming.' Multiple births don't run in either of their families. 'Not even twins,' Lauren Whiteley said. Identical triplets also were born December 5 to a woman in Billings, Montana. Dr. Savitri Kumar, a neonatologist at Henry Ford Hospital, said data on identical triplet births by natural conception varies from one in 60,000 to one in 2 million. Most doctors call the chances 'one-in-a-million,' Kumar said. Four sets of triplets were born at the hospital last year, but they weren't identical, she added. 'This is the very first set of identical triplets I have ever seen,' she said. For the Whiteleys, it will help that both sets of grandparents live within a mile, while aunts and uncles also are in the area. The grandparents 'will do what they need done on a day-to-day basis — as far as feeding, getting the kids to and from where they have to go,' said Bob Whiteley.

"Southern chef, Paula Deen, 68, is set to return to the airwaves after launching a new daily radio show . Disgraced TV chef Paula Deen is set to take over the airwaves with a new daily radio show. The Southern chef, 68, was a popular host on the Food Network for over 13 years before she was sacked over a racism scandal. As well as the daily radio show, Get Cooking with Paul Deen, she will also produce a weekly podcast. 'I had my first day in the studio yesterday and we had so much fun! I cannot wait to bring my vignettes and podcast to listeners around America,' Deen, 68, reportedly told PEOPLE . 'I have a ton of fun tips up my sleeve to make their life a little easier.' Her one minute long daily show will feature tips to help fans both in the kitchen and in life and her live 30-minute weekly show will also include creative director Brandon Branch. The new podcast will be launched on May 1. The celebrity chef, who counted billionaire Oprah Winfrey as one of her close friends has had a tumultuous few years mired by a race hate scandal. In 2012, a former manager at Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia, sued her and her brother for sexual and racial harassment. Lisa T Jackson's lawsuit alleged that Deen and Bubba committed violence, discrimination and racism which ended her five-year employment at Deen's Lady & Sons and Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House eateries in Savannah. In a deposition in court, Deen acknowledged using the ‘N word,’ but not telling racial jokes. In June 2013, she issued a grovelling, tearful video apology for her use of the word. ‘I want to apologize to everybody for the wrong that I've done,’ Deen said in the video statement. ‘I want to learn and grow from this. Inappropriate and hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable. I've made plenty of mistakes along the way but I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners, I beg for your forgiveness.’ N-word: The celebrity chef counted billionaire Oprah Winfrey as one of her close friends but has had a tumultuous few years mired by a race hate scandal . Since then, her vast food empire has taken a hit and many of her fans have deserted her. She was dropped by The Food Network and a host of other sponsors. In the wake of the scandal fans sent origami-folded butter wrappers to the Food Network and other companies that dropped the popular chef and cookbook author as a sign of protest. In February last year she told People magazine: ‘I feel like 'embattled' or 'disgraced' will always follow my name.’ ‘It's like that black football player who recently came out,’ she said, referring to Michael Sam. ‘He (Sam) said, 'I just want to be known as a football player. I don't want to be known as a gay football player.' I know exactly what he's saying.’","The Southern chef was a popular Food Network host for 13 years .

"A 69-year-old pilot and his two middle-aged female passengers crawled free from the mangled wreckage of a helicopter with barely a scratch after it crashed on the way to a funeral. Retired company director Paul Barnes was flying his partner Margaret Wilks, 53, and her friend to the memorial service of a family friend when he was forced to make a crash landing. He landed the £200,000 Robinson R44 Raven on farmland  outside the village of Aspley Guise, Bedfordshire after the engine failed. But the helicopter skidded and flipped on its side after landing in the mud, leaving the three people trapped inside. Pilot Paul Barnes, 69, and his two female passengers survived after his £200,000 helicopter (pictured) crashed on the way to a funeral . Mr Barnes, who has been flying for 20 years, said he is planning to go out again tomorrow and is already looking to purchase or rent another helicopter . 'It was very unfortunate and I was concerned that the engine might catch fire and the helicopter would blow up. But fortunately we all managed to crawl out from under the seatbelts and smash our way free. 'We had only been flying for about three minutes when I noticed the warning light was flashing. Either there was a problem with an engine or the propeller blades, but we started going into auto-rotation and made a crash landing. 'We landed in the mud and because it was so slippery the helicopter tipped over onto one side. Luckily none of us were injured and we escaped with just a few cuts and bruises.' Mr Barnes, his partner and her friend Bernadette Taylor, aged in her 50s, then made their way across two fields with all their luggage. The helicopter crash landed at around 11am on Wednesday and emergency services raced to the scene expecting serious casualties. The pilot was flying his partner Margaret Wilks, 53, and her friend Bernadette Taylor to the memorial service of a former test pilot in Sussex . But the pilot and  two female escaped without any serious injuries. They had taken off from a friend's farmland in Salford, Milton Keynes, and were planning to land on a private site in Witchill, Sussex. All three were on their way to the funeral of family friend John Dixon, whose brother was a retired test pilot for Robinsons. Once they had all been assessed by paramedics, Mr Barnes drove both women to the funeral service. Mr Barnes, who has been flying for 20 years, said he is planning to go out again tomorrow and is already looking to purchase or rent another helicopter. The former director of Fleet Street Travel said: 'I'll definitely be flying again tomorrow. This won't put me off at all. I just need to go out flying again as soon as possible. The pilot landed the Robinson R44 Raven on farmland just a mile from the M1 outside the village of Aspley Guise, Bedfordshire . Five police cars and a fire engine arrived to find the two women and pilot had kicked their way out of the wreckage . 'Both my partner and her friend were absolutely fine as well. We were all unhurt and that's the main thing. 'I'm hoping there will now be an investigation into exactly why the engine failed.' Inspector Tracey Day, of Bedfordshire Police, said: 'The passengers are very lucky to be alive. 'It's usually quite unlikely you are going to get to a helicopter crash and find you have got survivors. 'I was very pleased when I got there to find three people with cuts and bruises, but everyone had walked away relatively unscathed.' The Air Accident Investigation Bureau said it is currently investigating the incident. A spokesman for Bedfordshire Fire said: 'We arrived at the scene together with the police and ambulance service and the occupants had managed to get out safely so they were treated for cuts and bruises. 'Very fortunately the three occupants managed to get out and were unhurt apart from the cuts and bruises.' A spokesman from the East of England Ambulance service added that the helicopter had overturned and was upside down on the ground when they arrived.","Paul Barnes, 67, and two female passengers survived  helicopter crash .

"He has just won an Oscar for his moving portrayal of one of the world’s most famous men. But this is the first photograph of Eddie Redmayne in his latest role ... as a woman. Or, to be exact, a man who became a woman. For he plays transgender pioneer Einar Wegener – later known as Lili Elbe – in The Danish Girl. The movie, set in the 1920s, is a love story about how Wegener, a painter, was persuaded by his wife Gerda Waud (played by Alicia Vikander) – who was also an artist – to pose for her in women’s clothes after one of her models failed to show. In time, he became Lili and started on the transformation into a woman. Scroll down for video . Transformed: Eddie Redmayne as transgender pioneer Einar Wegener in The Danish Girl . Pioneer: Wegener (left),  a painter, was persuaded by his wife Gerda Waud to pose for her in women’s clothes after a model failed to show. In time, he became Lili, right, and started on the transformation into a woman . It could hardly be a bigger contrast to Redmayne’s Oscar-winning role as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything. Redmayne told the Mail that he has been ‘observing the minutiae of feminine physicality’, and to play Lili he worked with movement director Alexandra Reynolds, who also helped him choreograph his movements as Hawking. Redmayne said he started working with Reynolds early in January, when she flew out to LA to help him begin to create his portrait of Lili. ‘We’re looking at everything from a feminine perspective,’ he explained. Eddie called the true story of Wegener and his wife Gerda a study of ‘authenticity, identity and love’. ‘I think it’s the most sensitive role I have played,’ the 33-year-old actor added. He said he had spoken with members of the trans community, to research his role – though, of course, the sexual orientation was in its infancy in the 1920s, and there was little notion of surgery. ‘The danger of surgery was so extreme then,’ Eddie said. ‘It’s such a brave thing that Einar did.’ Method acting: Redmayne, pictured left as Stephen Hawking, told the Mail that he has been ‘observing the minutiae of feminine physicality’, and to play Lili he worked with movement director Alexandra Reynolds .

"An animal-obsessed photographer is looking to eliminate the stereotype of the 'crazy cat lady' by snapping portraits of his male friends and their felines - proving that the agile pets are also man's best friend. David Williams, who lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his own cat, has been photographing his male subjects and their felines since 2009 as part of his project Men & Cats. 'I found the way society genderizes animal ownership very compelling,' he told Daily Mail Online in an email. 'As a portrait photographer I was interested in capturing the relationships of my male friends and their feline friends.' Man's best friend: Grant and his cat Tux posed on a green couch next to a portrait of another feline as a part of photographer David Williams's photo project Men & Cats . Short leash: Mr Williams, who lives in Brooklyn, New York, captured Brian while he took his cat R2-D2 on a daytime stroll through the city . Model felines: Mr Williams photographed Eric and his cats Pup and Bean for this bedroom portrait . The 25-year-old, who will turn 26 this week, added: 'It was also a good excuse to hang out with a bunch of cats!' Mr Williams explained that the subjects of his ongoing project are either his friends, or friends of friends. Each thought-provoking portrait in the series features a man posing with one or more of his cats. Strike a pose: Earlier this week, Mr Williams shot this portrait of cinematographer Ronen Schechner and his cat Isabell . Popular pictures: The 25-year-old photographer, who will turn 26 this week, took to Instagram to share his latest portrait and thank those following his work . Into the wild: Brent cuddled with his feline companion Sammy for this unique outdoors shot . Soft coats: Mr Williams photographed Ross standing on his fluffy rug while holding his equally furry cat Jabsco . Although many of the shots were captured inside homes or apartments, there are images that show some men walking their cats on a leash or cuddling their feline companions outside. 'People have always responded well to the images and the idea,' Mr Williams said. 'Sometimes shooting personal work takes a very long time to pay off, so it’s also important to photograph something that you are interested in.' Earlier this week, Mr Williams shot a portrait of cinematographer Ronen Schechner with his cat, sharing the photo on his Instagram. Rock star kitty: Michael had his portrait shot in a room filled with guitars and records while his cat Sadie sat perched on his lap . Modern art: Matt showed off his tan and white cat Trixie along with his tattooed arm . Eclectic decor: Mr Williams captured Josh relaxing with his cat Lucero inside his apartment . Christmas kitties: Kent and his cats Jessie and Micky sit next to holiday decorations in his home featuring leather couches and a leopard print rug . 'I had the pleasure of photographing cinematographer, Ronen Schechner, with his cat Isabell while I was in Vermont yesterday. I never thought this project would take off like this, so thanks for all the love lately! Hope you enjoy this new ""Men & Cats"" photo,' he captioned the picture. The unique series is more than just a hobby, it's a way for Mr Williams to showcase his work. 'I feel like shooting personal work is very important for a photographer,' he explained. 'It gives me an opportunity to show photo editors and art buyers what I am capable to doing when I have complete creative control.' He added: 'If I’m not shooting commissioned work, I am either shooting something personal, or working on ways for me to stand out as a photographer.' Minimalist design: Mr Williams captured Corey's cat Tess as she sat narrowly perched on the corner of a side table . Furry chef: Chad's cat Newton was comfortably sprawled on the kitchen counter in this feline friendly photo shoot .

"With the cameras rolling, Daniel and Stephanie Rensing accepted an offer from a Shark Tank investor. But after they had time to think about it, they changed their minds. Annual revenue for their company, The Smart Baker, is close to $1 million, up from $130,000 before their March 2012 appearance on the ABC reality TV show. 'Not doing the deal and having that exposure was probably the best scenario for us,' says Daniel Rensing, CEO of the Rockledge, Florida, company which sells aprons, parchment paper and other baking equipment. Selling like hot cakes: Daniel Rensing and his wife Stephanie, owners of The Smart Baker, turned down Barbara Corcoran's offer of $75K for 40 per cent in 2012. Revenue is now close to $1m . Dreams of investor money have induced more than 150,000 businesses to apply to be contestants on Shark Tank, where entrepreneurs pitch to cast members including Barbara Corcoran, founder of a prominent New York real estate brokerage; Daymond John, founder of the clothing company FUBU; and Robert Herjavec, founder of the technology conglomerate Herjavec Group. Entrepreneurs may be all smiles when they get an offer on the show, but the deals aren't set in stone. Negotiations start soon after episodes are taped. Contestants can walk away if they don't like the terms. 'When we shake hands on a potential deal on Shark Tank, the romance runs high and everyone's excited about what could be,' Corcoran says. 'In the end, the entrepreneur is in charge.' During the first five seasons, 374 contestants appeared on TV and investors made 190 offers, according to ABC. Forty-eight contestants turned down offers during taping, executive producer Clay Newbill says. They haven't tracked how many deals fell apart during negotiations. The producers ask entrepreneurs and investors to make their best efforts to close deals, Newbill says. Dealmakers: Dreams of investor money have induced more than 150,000 businesses to apply to be contestants on Shark Tank and pitch their businesses to the panel (pictured) 'But we understand, just as in the real world, the reality is that not all deals will close,' he says. Corcoran offered $75,000 for 40 per cent of The Smart Baker, and a 5 per cent sales royalty, during the 2011 taping. During negotiations the Rensings, disagreed with Corcoran about the target market. 'We were sticking to our guns on the market we served,' Rensing says. Corcoran says she was disappointed, but she knows a rejection is an occupational hazard on Shark Tank. 'Nobody likes to be turned down, especially me,' she says. The Smart Baker has thrived without her money. In the following year, revenue grew to $600,000. The episode also helped the company get noticed by Food Network and other media. Reruns provide a sales bump. But a Shark Tank deal isn't just about money; it also brings expertise and mentoring from a pro. The Rensings don't dwell on what they might have missed by not sticking with Corcoran. 'There is always the ""what ifs"", but we don't let that get to us,' Daniel Rensing says. Some contestants may turn down offers because they feel there are more important things than getting investors, says Matthew Rutherford, an entrepreneurship professor at Oklahoma State University who has studied Shark Tank pitches. Going solo: The Rensings, pictured in their warehouse in Rockledge, Florida, say they don't dwell on what they might have missed by not sticking with Corcoran . 'What they crave over everything including money and wealth is autonomy,' Rutherford says. Entrepreneurs who appear on the show are likely hoping for both a cash infusion and control of their companies, says Harvard Business School professor Noam Wasserman. But the money doesn't guarantee success, and having an investor may be an unpleasant experience. 'You could end up with the worst of both worlds,' he says. When Mona Weiss and Scott Shields pitched their company, Eco Nuts, on an episode that aired in October 2012, Herjavec offered $175,000 for 50 per cent. Weiss and Shields, who wanted to sell a 15 per cent stake for that amount, said no on the spot. 'It was a terrible deal, really awful. No one would give up half their company for less than they make in a year,' Weiss says. The Lawndale, California, company, which makes laundry detergent from berries, was on track for $250,000 in revenue in 2012. A spokeswoman for Herjavec, Erin McLean, says he does not comment on deals or offers that are closed. Some people told Weiss and Shields they were foolish. 'They said, ""it was a lot of money, you should have taken that,""' Weiss says. But being on Shark Tank put Eco Nuts on a faster track to its current success. Revenue, now over $1 million, grew so much the company moved to manufacturing space five times bigger than its original factory.","The Smart Baker turned down Barbara Corcoran's offer of $75K for 40% in 2012.

"Tens of thousands of people were cut off from phone and Internet for more than 12 hours in Arizona on Wednesday. Vandals cut a fiber-optic line located in a desert north of Phoenix that provides internet and phone services to tens of thousands of people throughout the state. Although most communication services were restored after being down for six and a half hours, some people were not connected until early on Thursday morning. Scroll down for video . Vandals cut through a fiber-optic line (pictured) in Northern Arizona on Wednesday that brought phone and internet services down in large parts of Northern Arizona for six and a half hours . A Phoenix Police Department officer said vandals had completely cut through the cable, which is located in the desert north of the capital in an area inaccessible to vehicles. Meanwhile, even in cities 100 miles away from Phoenix, ATM machines stopped working, businesses couldn't process credit cards and residents said they felt lost without the internet. Emergency services were also affected in a number of cities. Prescott Valley had to supplement 911 service with 'handheld radios and alternate phone numbers'. Water and sewer facilities in the region also had to switch to manual operations. Emergency lines were also limited in Yavapai County and authorities were unable to access law enforcement databases. The Arizona Department of Public Safety helped dispatch police and fire services in Flagstaff. Zak Holland, a computer store technician at Northern Arizona University said students panicked when they couldn't go online to complete assignments that were due. 'It just goes to show how dependent we are on the internet when it disappears,'  Holland told CBS 5. A university spokesman said professors could decide how to handle assignments turned in late because of the outage. And staff at Bookmans Entertainment Exchange, a popular bookstore and cafe in Flagstaff, watched as people left immediately, their computers in tow, when they found out the internet was out. Other truckers were stranded in the city because they couldn't use their company gas cards to fill up their tanks. Even weather reports couldn't reach some regions. Instead of local temperatures, blank spaces showed up on Phoenix television stations' evening news reports. But not everyone was having such a horrible time. Tourist Peter Donahower told CBS 5 he was having fun 'kickin' it old school.' And although Jessie Hutchison couldn't buy an ice cream because she didn't have cash on hand, she said she only found the situation 'moderately annoying'. 'It's not going to ruin my day,' she said. A spokesman for CenturyLink, which owns the fiber-optic cable, said technicians had to inspect the line 'mile by mile'. Services were fully restored by early on Thursday morning.

"Ceres continues to baffle astronomers as the Dawn spacecraft gets closer to being captured into orbit around the dwarf planet. The latest images, taken nearly 29,000 miles (46,000km) from Ceres, reveal that a bright 'alien' spot that stands out in previous images lies close to yet another bright area. While Nasa has not provided an explanation, scientists suggest these spots may be frozen pools of ice at the bottom of a crater that reflect light. Scroll down for video . Ceres continues to baffle astronomers as the Dawn spacecraft gets closer to being captured into orbit around the dwarf planet. This image was taken by the Dawn spacecraft of dwarf planet Ceres on February 19 from a distance of nearly 29,000 miles (46,000 km). It shows that the brightest spot on Ceres has a dimmer companion, which apparently lies in the same basin . 'Right now, all we can say is that the material reflects 40 per cent or more of the light falling on it,' UCLA astronomer Chris Russell, the principal investigator for the Dawn mission, told NBC News. 'This limit is because of the resolution of the camera at this distance from Ceres. If the final answer is that it reflects all the light that falls on it, then the most probable reflector would be ice.' He added that there may be a volcano-like origin of the spots, but that Nasa will have to wait for better resolution before we can make such geologic interpretations. Using its ion propulsion system, Dawn will enter orbit around Ceres on March 6. When it does, it will become the first human-made probe to visit the 'Death Star' planet - and scientists hope it will uncover the secrets behind its mysterious white spot. Dawn observed Ceres completing one full rotation, which lasted about nine hours. The images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at Ceres' surface: from shallow, flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers . This animation, enhanced with a star field and projected onto a sphere, showcases a series of images the Dawn spacecraft took on approach to Ceres on February 4 . The dwarf planet has been likened to the death Star from the hit film Star Wars . As scientists receive better and better views of the dwarf planet over the next 16 months, they hope to gain a deeper understanding of its origin and evolution by studying its surface. The intriguing bright spots and other interesting features of this captivating world will come into sharper focus. 'The brightest spot continues to be too small to resolve with our camera, but despite its size it is brighter than anything else on Ceres,' said Andreas Nathues, lead investigator for the framing camera team at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Gottingen, Germany. Earlier this month, Dawn returned yet another series of stunning animations of Ceres as its moves ever closer to the dwarf planet. At a resolution of 8.5 miles (14km) per pixel, the pictures represent the sharpest images to date of the icy world, which Dawn is due to arrive at on March 6. The set of images - which are stitched together in an animation - were taken on February 4th at a distance of about 90,000 miles (145,000 km). 'We know so little about our vast solar system, but thanks to economical missions like Dawn, those mysteries are being solved,' said Jim Green, Planetary Science Division Director at Nasa. The new Dawn images come on the heels of initial navigation images taken in January that reveal an 'alien' white spot on the dwarf planet and the suggestion of craters. Over the next weeks, Dawn will provide increasingly sharper images of the icy world. 'We know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet Ceres. 'Now, Dawn is ready to change that,' said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director, based at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. At 8.5 miles (14km) per pixel, the pictures represent the sharpest images to date of the icy world, which Dawn is due to arrive at on March 6 . The 'alien' mark can be clearly seen in the latest images the icy world as the Dawn probe hurtles its way towards a rendezvous on March 6 . On the left is a processed image, taken January 13. It hints at craters on the surface of Ceres. Dawn's framing camera took this image at 238,000 miles (383,000km) from Ceres. On the right, is a zoomed-in raw image . Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' Observations by the European Space Agency's Herschel telescope suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes. Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left . Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. It is due to land next year. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice, water, and minerals. Dr Michael Kuppers, of the Esa's lab in Villanueva de la Canada in Spain said: 'Although ground and space-based observations may further map the behaviour of Ceres over its orbit the Dawn spacecraft mission arriving to orbit Ceres in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long-term follow-up on the water outgassing behaviour of Ceres.' The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. Ceres is twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface .","Ceres orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter, and may have water gushing from its surface .

"The 3,650-year old skeleton of King Senebkay has revealed the pharaoh died a violent death. Senebkay lived at a time when rulers battled for power before the rise of Egypt’s New Kingdom in 1,550 BC and his skeleton shows 18 injuries caused by axes. Injuries to his skull, lower back and ankles, suggest he was attacked while on his horse and hacked at with the deadly weapon - dying from blows to the head. The 3,650-year old skeleton of King Senebkay (pictured right) has revealed the pharaoh died a violent death from blows to the head with axes. Archaeologists uncovered the tomb, complete with paintings, last year . The tomb of Senebkay was unearthed at the Abydos archaeological site, near the city of Sohag, Egypt last year and was identified by an inscription on the wall of this burial chamber. It was the first time that any trace of the pharaoh was found, who was only previously known about by fragments of his name on an ancient list of Egyptian rulers. Now, archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania, who came across the tomb, have revealed how the pharaoh probably died. Injuries to the skull, as well as vertical cuts on the ankles, feet and lower back, suggest the king was killed in a battle and was aged between  35 and 49 when he died, Luxor Times Magazine reported. Archaeologists from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and the University of Pennsylvania identified the tomb of Senebkay by drawings on the wall of his burial chamber (pictured), which was unearthed in the Abydos archaeological site last year . Until this discovery, the pharaoh called Senebkay was largely unknown to historians. He ruled over a forgotten Abydos dynasty around 1,650BC. His tomb, together with an ancient cataloguing of Egyptian rulers called the Turin King List, suggests that Senebkay was the first or second of a series of approximately 20 as-yet-undiscovered pharaohs that ruled over a small kingdom. He was killed by axe blows to the head, his skeletal remains reveal. It’s thought he was between the ages of 35 and 49 when he died. The angle and direction of the lacerations show he must have been higher up than his attackers when the struck him with axes. It is likely that the king was on horseback and blows to his back and legs caused him to fall to the ground, where his enemies brutally struck his head until he died, far from his home. Josef Wegner of the university, who led the dig, said the injuries suggest that the king died a violent death. He was a ruler of Abydos for just four and a half years, at a time when dominant families battled for control of land. The angle and direction of the lacerations show he must have been higher up than his attackers when they cut him with axes. It is likely that the king was on horseback and blows to his back and legs caused him to fall to the ground, where his enemies brutally struck his head until he died, far from his home. King Senebkay’s body is believed to have been mummified a long time after his death. Historical sources suggest that Egyptians were skilful horsemen during the Second Intermediate Period, even though horses were not commonly used in battle. Dr Youssef Khalifa, head of Ancient Egypt department, said the king’s pelvic and leg bones suggest he was used to riding horses regularly. ‘It is not clear yet if Senebkay died in a battle against the Hyksos, who were occupying Lower Egypt at that time, or not,’ he said. ‘If future studies proved it so this will make him the first warrior king who fought for liberation even before Senakhtenre’ the founder of 17th Dynasty and the grandfather of Ahmos who defeated the Hyksos.’ The lost tomb (pictured) was discovered by a team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania, who came across it while excavating the tomb of pharaoh Sobekhotep I, who was buried nearby . The tomb was discovered at the Abydos site (pictured) near Sohag in Egypt and could lead to more royal tombs being unearthed. Archaeologists came across the tomb while excavating the final resting place of pharaoh Sobekhotep I, who was buried nearby . Archaeologists came across the tomb while excavating the final resting place of pharaoh Sobekhotep I, who was buried nearby. Senebkay’s final resting place appears to have been plundered because the skeleton is pulled apart, but it’s estimated he was five ft 10 inches (1.78metres) tall. Dr Wegner believes the find could lead to the discovery of more pharaohs and could help piece together the gaps in knowledge about the rulers of Ancient Egypt. ‘We discovered an unknown king plus a lost dynasty. It looks likely that all of the 16 kings are all buried there,’ he said. ‘We now have the tomb for first or second king of this dynasty. There should be a whole series of the others.’ The same team of archaeologists discovered a vast 3,800-year-old quartzite sarcophagus, which belongs to a little-known 13th dynasty king, Sobekhotep I. It was discovered by an international team of researchers who deciphered inscriptions to link it to its owner . Describing the moment the archaeologists came across the tomb, he explained that they found the entrance first, which led them down to the burial chamber, made of limestone and painted with cartouches of the pharaoh. ‘In Abydos there is lots of sand and everything is deeply buried. You can dig day after day, and then this….We were standing there looking dumbfounded at the colourful wall decoration,’ he said. While robbers had stripped the tomb, a re-used burial chest had the engraving of the ruler’s name on the wood. The experts said the re-use of materials suggests a lack of stability and wealth at a time when the kingdom was fragmented. A year before King Sebekay's tomb was found, a huge pink 3,800-year-old quartzite sarcophagus was unearthed. It belongs to a little-known 13th Dynasty king called Sobekhotep I, according to the Egyptian government. The 60 tonne sarcophagus was discovered by the same team of archaeologists at the Abydos site. A team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry deciphered stone pieces inscribed with the pharaoh’s name, which also show him sitting on a throne, to link the tomb to its owner. ‘He is likely the first who ruled Egypt at the start of the 13th Dynasty during the second intermediate period,’ the minister said. King Sobekhotep I is thought to have ruled the 13th Dynasty but little is known about him and his kingdom or even when the dynasty began exactly, which makes the discovery particularly important. Historians believe that it began sometime between 1803BC and 1781BC but they are keen to establish a precise date. He is thought to have ruled for almost five years, which was ‘the longest rule at this time’ according to ministry official Ayman El-Damarani. Archaeologists discovered a connection between the tombs of Sobekhotep I and Sebebkay. A chest made of cedar wood that contained Senebkay’s organs,  was excavated by Kevin Cahail, a PhD student in Egyptology at the university. The box had been gilded, but ancient tomb robbers had removed the gold, uncovering an inscription of a king’s name. But the name was Sobekhotep’s, not Senebkay’s. Dr Wegner and Mr Cahail  realised that objects from Sobekhotep’s tomb had been repurposed to bury Senebkay.","The 3,650-year old skeleton of King Senebkay revealed 18 injuries by axes .

"Jailed: Oliver Gore-Booth shot more than 70 secret films of women with a spy camera shaped like a pen . A voyeur has been jailed for a year after he filmed women with a spy pen more than 70 times in gym showers, on the Tube and even in his own bathroom. 'Addict' Oliver Gore-Booth, an ex-public schoolboy whose uncle was Britain's High Commissioner in India, spent three years amassing the depraved stash before he was caught in a north London gym. A staff member picked up his camera thinking it was just a pen - and called police after discovering its contents. It took almost no time to find 32-year-old Gore-Booth, because he had been a member of the gym for four years and caught himself on camera pressing the record button. Police seized two laptops at his home in Wandsworth, south west London, and found more than 70 videos. They showed women showering at the gym and using sunbeds, and included up-skirt shots of women on London Underground escalators. The HR manager even filmed videos of women using the bathroom at his home, Blackfriars Crown Court heard, and filmed a couple having sex in a hotel room at a wedding. In each of the videos, Gore-Booth could be seen either in the footage while filming or planting the camera and then retrieving it at the end. Police found several more similar videos which Gore-Booth had downloaded from the internet. The 32-year-old, whose uncle was  diplomat Sir David Gore-Booth and whose great-great-grandfather was  Arctic explorer the 5th Baronet Gore, of Lissadell, tried to deny responsibility. He told police: 'It will take a long time to explain, but I was approached four weeks ago and offered money. 'I said no, but saw the camera in the changing rooms and made the wrong decision to move it away.' Depraved: Gore-Booth was caught out by a staff member at the Anytime gym in Islington, north London . But the lie quickly unraveled and he pleaded guilty to five counts of voyeurism and four of outraging public decency. Lyell Thompson, prosecuting, described how Gore-Booth was finally caught in the Anytime Gym in Islington, north London. Mr Thompson said: 'He thought it was just a pen and he picked it up with the intention of handing it in. 'But he forgot until he got home and, when he examined the pen, he found it was a camera with a UBS stick. 'He put it in his computer and saw a man installing the camera in the shower cubicle before he immediately turned it off. 'He handed the pen in to the gym manager, who recognised Mr Gore-Booth who had been a member since 2010. The police were called and he was arrested the next time he visited the gym. Gore-Booth went to Canford School in Wimborne, an independent school which charges £10,000 a term . One victim became anxious and paranoid after finding out she had been filmed in the bathroom at Gore-Booth's home. Mr Thompson, summarising the victim's statement, said: 'She says what happened is not normal, not right. 'She keeps thinking of the victims, the poor girls who have no idea they are even on the film.' She described constantly feeling like she is being watched and said the episode has impacted on her confidence and social life. Another victim said in a statement the filming had been a 'breach of trust and an invasion of privacy'. Gore-Booth attended Canford School in Wimborne, an independent school which charges £10,000 a term, and was represented by a top Queen's Counsel barrister in court. His uncle,   Sir David Gore-Booth, died aged 61 in 2004 after a 34-year diplomatic career as Britain's ambassador to Saudi Arabia and High Commissioner in India. His great uncle was leading diplomat Lord Paul Gore-Booth, while his great, great grandfather was an Arctic explorer, the 5th Baronet Gore, of Lissadell, co. Sligo. Andrew Trollope QC, representing Gore-Booth, said his client had been seeking help for his addiction and said he was described as a 'decent, kind-hearted and loving person' by friends. He also said Gore-Booth's girlfriend was sticking by him 'in what must be difficult personal circumstances for her'. He added: 'He's had to confront a long-standing addiction to this kind of behaviour and recognising the unacceptability of his conduct and the depth of his problem has been a difficult and painful process.' Descendant: Oliver Gore-Booth is the nephew of the late Sir David Gore-Booth (above), Britain's former High Commissioner in India, and is also the great-great-grandson of Arctic explorer the 5th Baronet Gore . Judge Henry Blacksell QC told Gore-Booth his crimes deserved a custodial sentence, despite pleas from the defence to suspend the jail term. Speaking in front of Gore-Booth's family  in the public gallery, he said: 'Some of the people who you recorded came to your address expecting hospitality or safety and you breached this in a mean and cunning way. 'It was a terrible thing and it must have been very shocking for those who received and welcomed your hospitality to suddenly be aware of what a gross breach of trust that was when you secretly filmed them in instances of loving intimacy. 'That is, in my judgement, a gross breach of trust, let alone the filming in the hotel bathroom.' Gore-Booth hung his head and closed his eyes as he was jailed for nine months for installing the cameras and three months for each of the voyeurism charges, to run concurrently. He will also be placed on the sex offenders' register for ten years and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order.","'Addict' voyeur Oliver Gore-Booth also filmed women on Tube escalator .

"Have you ever been uncomfortably constipated, unable to go to the loo even though you desperately need to? If so, you're not alone, as it's estimated that around one in every seven adults and up to one in every three children has constipation at any one time. Now, one expert advises that a hot drink could solve the problem. This is because hot beverages such as coffee, tea - or even a cup of hot water - stimulate the bowel, easing constipation. Dr Felice Schnoll-Sussman, a gastroenterologist at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, US, said hot drinks widen blood vessels, aiding digestion. Hot beverages such as coffee, tea - or even a cup of hot water - stimulate the bowel, easing constipation. Her advice is backed up by a study which found hot drinks do indeed induce a 'desire to defecate'. 'The warm liquid acts as a vasodilator,' she told Runners World magazine, while giving advice to marathon runners who want to avoid being constipated during a big race. 'It widens blood vessels in the digestive system and helps increase blood flow and GI activity.' But caffeine isn't responsible, as even decaffeinated coffee brings on the desire to go to the loo, she said. Drinking a cup of coffee and then sitting on the loo should help stimulate a bowel movement, she added. 'Just the act of sitting there for few minutes can bring on the urge to go, even if you don't feel like you have to right away,' she said. Physical activity can also induce a trip to the loo, she advised. Massaging the perineum – the area between the anus and the genitals – can help ease constipation, a study found. In a trial, 72 per cent of people taking part found self-acupressure helped them have a bowel movement. Researchers advised that all doctors should consider this technique as the first thing constipated people could try – along with conventional treatment like eating more fibre, drinking more fluid and taking more exercise. The study’s author Dr. Ryan Abbott, UCLA Centre for East-West Medicine, US, said: “Constipation is very common and can have debilitating symptoms. ‘But patients can perform this simple intervention themselves to treat their own constipation and improve their quality of life. It can also help to limit health care costs and excessive medication use.” The research was published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. Therefore, people with constipation should consider jogging up and down stairs, or doing star jumps or stretches to stimulate the bowel. And last year U.S. researchers found massaging can help pass a stool. Researchers found applying gentle pressure to the perineum – the area between the anus and genitals – helped constipated people have a bowel movement. This 'self-acupressure' broke up hard stools, relaxed muscles and stimulated nerves responsible for bowel movements, easing constipation, they found. They said doctors should consider this technique as the first thing to try – along with conventional treatments like drinking more fluid, eating more fibre, taking more exercise, or taking laxatives. The World Gastrology Organisation defines constipation as people who pass fewer than three bowel movements a week; feel a quarter of their stools are hard or feel a sense of incomplete evacuation in more than a quarter of their movements. Doctors advise most cases of constipation can be treated with diet and lifestyle changes, as it can be caused by not eating enough fibre, changing eating habits and ignoring the urge to go to the loo. Sometimes, constipation is a side-effect of certain medications such as codeine, or supplements such as iron, or can be caused by anxiety or depression. U.S. researchers found massaging the perineum - the area between the anus and genitals - can also help constipated people pass a stool .","Dr Felice Schnoll-Sussman is a gastroenterologist at Weill Medical College .

"AHA! THE MOMENTS OF INSIGHT THAT SHAPED OUR WORLD . by William B. Irvine . (OUP £16.99) Everyone knows that Archimedes had a brilliant idea in his bath and shouted ‘Eureka’ at his discovery — indeed, it is possibly the only Greek word most people know. Similarly, Isaac Newton is indelibly imprinted on our minds with the image of an apple falling on his head. These are what William Irvine, in this lucid, engaging and thought-provoking book, calls ‘aha moments’ — unexpected insights powering intellectual and creative breakthroughs. Irvine, a distinguished American professor of philosophy, explores this process in the five areas of human activity in which he judges inspiration (or revelation) to be essential — religion, morality, science, mathematics and the arts — and examines the psychology and neuroscience behind these lightbulb moments. Author, William B. Irvine, explores what happens in these instances of discovery and illustrates that original insight and invention are nothing without hard work (stock image) What emerges is a catalogue of brilliance, hard work, serendipity and luck, and a long history of resistance to new ideas: Giordano Bruno, for instance, was burned at the stake for suggesting the sun was at the centre of the solar system; Fleming discovered penicillin as a result of keeping an untidy lab; Roger Penrose’s understanding of black holes came to him on a walk. The sections on science and mathematics are the most thrilling. For Irvine, mathematical insights are the purest, requiring the greatest dedication in their pursuit and resulting in the purest beauty, as in Andrew Wiles proving Fermat’s Last Theorem. Irvine also shows us that original insight and invention are nothing without the old-fashioned virtues of hard work and perseverance. While using the conscious mind to solve a problem, great mathematicians, scientists and artists employ a process of trial and error that also requires moments of inspiration for their work to progress: ‘Chance favours the prepared mind’, in the words of Louis Pasteur. Einstein’s realisation that time is not absolute was followed by eight years of hard work; Mahler’s 7th Symphony theme came to him when he heard the oars of a boat — but only after many hours of struggle. Irvine cites many lesser-known figures whose insights have altered the course of human endeavour. In many cases, what stands out is not so much the discovery itself, but the courage in defending that discovery against the accepted orthodoxy, even when such a position was dangerous or uncomfortable. Indeed, many scientific insights have been held back by professional envy and rivalry, and women have long struggled to be heard in the male-dominated corridors of academia. Irvine is a likeable and companionable guide: wry, cajoling (‘If this thought doesn’t utterly astonish you, you have my sympathy’) and amusing at times, occasionally drawing on a personal anecdote to press home the point. There’s some complicated maths and science in here, but this is largely accessible stuff. This book may not provide you with the recipe for your own ‘aha moment’, but it will lead you to an appreciation and fresh understanding of what happens when it does occur.","Author, William B.

Prince William (left) showed an increasing resemblance to his Uncle Edward (right) as he revealed a bald patch while enjoying a traditional tea ceremony in central Tokyo . Warm welcome: Prince William's visit to Tokyo began with a traditional tea ceremony . The second-in-line to the throne has been gradually losing his hair for many years, just like his uncle, who began going bald at the age of 21 . Traditional: The tea ceremony is an ancient tradition in Japan and is a sign of respect . Despite Diana's blonde locks driving the Japanese wild on her visits there, Prince William appears to have inherited the so-called 'curse of the Windsors'. The elder members of the Royal Family deal with their follicular challenges in different ways. William's paternal grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh - who began losing his hair at 28 - makes little attempt to disguise his shining pate and Prince Edward also favours the honest approach. Prince Charles, however, who began losing his hair at 28, goes for the 'combover'. In contrast, Prince Harry's bushy ginger mop as yet shows no sign of following the same trend. Most experts agree that male pattern baldness is passed on by the mother's side of the family. William's late grandfather Earl Spencer had a bald patch. Prince Charles, who began losing his hair at 28, goes for the 'combover' But scientists have found evidence that in some cases it can also come down from the father's side. The future king has himself previously joked about his receding hairline, telling photographers and reporters after Prince George was born: 'He's got more hair than me, thank God.' William was given a rapturous welcome as he was met by flag-waving fans in Tokyo as he marked the start of week-long tour of Japan and China on behalf of the Government. After a twelve-hour flight and a whirlwind tour of Tokyo in the driving rain, he was treated to full-blown traditional tea ceremony, complete with a delicate plate of cakes. Joined by Tokyo governor, Yoichi Masuzoe, William watched as servers prepared the bitter green tea powder before adding water and frothing the mixture using a small wooden whisk. The ceremony, which took place in the same tea house used to welcome Prince Albert during his visit to the country in 1869, is a sign of respect. William is at the start of a four-day visit to Japan, during which he will travel to Fukushima, the centre of a nuclear meltdown triggered by the 2011 tsunami. The first two days, however, are to be spent in the Japanese capital Tokyo and it was there he landed, arriving at Haneda airport in the early hours of the morning. Met by Mr Masuzoe and hundreds of excited fans, William was ushered into a boat limousine before being whisked across the water to the site of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Royal visit: Prince Albert had his tea ceremony at the same tea house, recently restored, as William . Fascinated: William looked on intently as the history of Japan's tea ceremony was explained . Ritual: The moment was overseen by Sen Genshitsu (left), a former grand master of the Urasenke (ceremony) Beautiful: William got a brief tour of the spectacular Hama Rikyu gardens . Historic: The classical gardens once belonged to a shogun, one of the hereditary military governors of Japan . Long day: It was dark by the time the Prince left the tea ceremony but still very wet . Big group: The Duke and the governor were trailed by a large group of flunkies . Piling in: The group did manage to squeeze into the park's beautifully restored tea house . Rapturous: William was met by a crowd of smartphone-waving fans at Tokyo's Haneda airport . Pleased: The Prince looked thrilled with his warm welcome and beamed at the crowd of well-wishers . All smiles: Before leaving the airport, he treated fans to a smile and a wave . The Prince, who appeared none the worse for his long flight, smiled and waved at the pursuing press, among them photographers crammed onto a boat travelling close behind. After completing the tea ceremony at the Hama Rikyu Gardens, he was then shown around the Edo-era style plot, which is filled with sculpted pine trees and blossoming plum trees and once belonged to a shogun [Japanese aristocrat]. Wooden bridges run over several lakes, where water birds float. Gardeners have been hard at work for days, clipping the trees and setting up lights, preparing for the visit. It was a rare peaceful moment in what looks set to be a busy schedule, with meetings with Japan's much-loved Emperor Akihito and Crown Prince Naruhito all on the agenda. But the visit isn't without controversy, much of it due to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who, say critics, is 'using' the royal visit to Fukushima to further his own aims. One, Tokuo Hayakawa, a Buddhist priest from the town of Naraha, two miles from the Fukushima plant, told The Times: 'I think Abe is using him [William]. 'It's true that you can find children playing outside, and you can eat some Fukushima food. But to take that as the overall reality here is totally wrong. And again! When the Prince arrived at Tokyo's Hama Rikyu Gardens, yet more fans were waiting . Drizzly: Despite a torrential downpour, William spent several minutes meeting well-wishers . Colourful: With many clutching British Union flags and Japanese Nisshōki, the crowd was a colourful sight . Excited: A pleased-looking William found himself surrounded by smiling female fans . Child-friendly: Also waiting to welcome the Prince was a group of local students still in their school uniform . All smiles: Prince William spent several minutes chatting to the youngsters . Grey day: William arrived at the Tokyo park on a boat limousine, watched by a cheering crowd . Thrilled: Excited Japanese fans wait in the rain to see the Prince arrive at the Hama Rikyu Gardens . 'If I could, I would take him to these abandoned ghost towns, and to the temporary houses where people still live, so he could see the reality that we are facing.' Less controversial is William's visit to a TV broadcaster, where he will meet actors dressed as samurai and geishas, and his visit to a bookshop where Aston Martin cars will be on display. Along with Fukushima, the 32-year-old Prince will  visit other areas devastated by the March 2011 tsunami to show support for the survivors and pay his respects to those who died. The tsunami and the earthquake that set it off killed 9,000 people, and displaced tens of thousands, among them those caught in the Fukushima meltdown. Japan and the UK have enjoyed friendly relations for decades, and, as a result, the Japanese public is almost as enthusiastic about British royals as they are about their own. William, who has had a Japanese following since childhood, is particularly popular thanks to the influence of his mother. Indeed, so loved was the late Princess of Wales, her visits to Japan in 1986 and 1995 sparked what local commentators described as 'Diana fever'. Crowd control: Even the local police couldn't resist queuing up for a chat with the Prince . No stopping: Happily, not even heavy downpours could dampen the spirits of royal fans . Still going: Despite having just stepped off the plane, William was happy to wave at pursuing photographers . Quick tour: William's first stop was at the site of the 2020 Olympics, currently under construction .

"Cadaver dogs are to search the former site of the sister campus of a notorious Florida boy's reform school where pupils were beaten, raped and killed. University of South Florida researchers have found the remains of 51 people buried at Dozier School in Marianna and are now turning their attentions to the Okeechobee School for Boys, with the search to begin in April. When the notorious state-run reform school in Marianna became overcrowded, a second campus in Okeechobee was opened in the late 1950s. The Okeechobee School for Boys (pictured) was built in the late 1950s to cope with the overflow from Dozier School in Marianna - cadaver dogs will begin searching for possible remains in April . Former students Marvin Mike, left, and Joseph Johnson, right, have spoken out about the abuse they suffered and witnessed while attending the Okeechobee School for Boys . Several of the same staff members accused of brutal beatings in Marianna were also transferred to the Okeechobee campus. The Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office told WESH.com they plan to bring cadaver dogs to the campus in April in the wake of their findings in Marianna. Some former students from the 1950s and 1960s have for at least a decade accused employees and guards at both schools of physical and sexual abuse. Although records only showed 31 burials at the Marianna school between its opening in 1900 and its 2011 closure, USF researchers found the remains of 24 additional people during a dig in 2013. They are currently working to identify all the remains. Like Marianna, boys were housed at Okeechobee for minor offenses such as petty theft, truancy or running away from home, but many former students claim they were subjected to bloody beatings. Several of the same staff members accused of brutal beatings in Marianna were also transferred to the Okeechobee campus . Although records only showed 31 burials at the Marianna school between its opening in 1900 and its 2011 closure, USF researchers found the remains of 24 additional people during a dig in 2013 . Boy would be taken to a small office called the Adjustment Center where they would be forced to lie face down and be beaten repeatedly with a leather paddle. Former students recall stories of boys being beaten to death and buried behind the school's dairy barn. 'Some of the boys they would just beat, beat, beat, beat until they passed out,' Joseph Johnson told WESH. 'It was known among us that they would kill you. They would literally beat you to death.' He claims he saw a boy being carried out and driven in a station wagon to the back of the school where the next day there was a fresh grave. When he asked a staff member they told him they had buried a cow. Another student, who was on the segregated black side of the school, recalls friends suddenly disappearing and staff members claiming that the boys had run away . 'If they ran away, why hasn't anyone heard from them again?' Marvin Mike told WESH. 'They didn't run away. They was carried away.' He said his friend, Cherry Black, went missing only for his body to be found in a septic tank on campus two weeks later. Staff claimed the boy had tried to run away, hid in the tank, and accidentally drowned in sewage. Mike never believed their story. 'They killed him and put him in there,' Mike said.

"The man at the centre of a network that influenced the ISIS executioner identified as 'Jihadi John' was allowed to fly in and out of London to terrorism hot spots unchecked for almost three years. Bilal al-Berjawi passed through UK Border Control at least five times between 2006 and 2009 as he travelled between London and African terror cells. Over that period he was rising to prominence as a senior member of al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda linked group in Somalia - returning to the UK only to raise funds and to marry. Scroll down for video . Lebanon born Bilal al-Berjawi (right) traveled freely between the UK and terror hubs in East Africa as he rose to prominence with al-Qaeda. He is believed to have radicalised Mohammed Emwazi (left) - revealed earlier today as the masked ISIS executioner Jihadi John - on his return visits to London . It is believed that it was during these return visits to London that al-Berjawi became the driving force behind the radicalisation of 27-year-old Mohammed Emwazi, using his growing stature within the terror group to radicalise homegrown extremists. Emwazi was today named as terror suspect 'Jihadi John', the black cloaked executioner who featured in the beheading videos of British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers. According to people who have moved in jihadi circles in west London, Emwazi began to be noticed 'five or six years ago', when al-Berjawi was still flying between the UK and Africa. 'That's when he emerged, so to speak,' said one. Bilal al-Berjawi  was killed by a drone strike in Somalia three years ago. Bilal al-Berjawi was killed in a 2012 drone attack . By that point he was a key figure in al-Qaeda's East African operations. Originally from Lebanon, Berjawi first joined militants in Somalia in 2006 and then returned to Britain in 2007 on a fundraising venture. He left again in February 2009 with his friend Mohammed Sakr, who is of Egyptian origin, to travel to Kenya, telling their families they were going on a safari - the same front used by Mohammed Emwazi when he flew to Tanzania in 2009. They aroused the suspicions of the manager of the hotel at which they were staying in Mombasa and when they moved to Nairobi, police raided the premises and they were deported. A laptop found at the premises contained extremist material including encouragement of jihad and instructions on making car bombs. Berjawi married a Somali woman in London, and in October 2009, they decided to slip out of the country again, without telling their families that they were leaving. All three were the subject of a manhunt, accused of crossing into Uganda to plot terrorist attacks that culminated in bomb attacks in Kampala in July 2011 that killed 74 people. Police stand guard near Jihadi John's last known residence in Queens Park, London, after his identity was confirmed as 27-year-old Mohammed Emwazi . Berjawi was said to be a senior figure with al-Qaeda in East Africa, a radical part of the al-Shabaab movement, and was known as one of its most active fighters. He was also responsible for securing weapons and for overseeing the contingent of foreign fighters. In an online obituary published in 2013, al-Shabaab said 'Abu Hafs' had been trained by two top military commanders of al-Qaeda in East Africa, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed and Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan. The government stripped both men of their British passports and they were killed in separate drone attacks in 2012. Court documents relating to Mohammed Emwazi today showed that Emwazi was part of an extremist network linked to al-Shabaab, the BBC reported. MI5 files stated that his name was one of several terror suspects believed to be aiding the Somali terror cell in their provision of funds and equipment.","Bilal Berjawi flew in and out of UK to African terror hubs routinely .

"A Conservative councillor was photographed as he spent two hours on his mobile phone during a town hall debate on a rise in council tax. Councillor Eric Nicholson played solitaire, checked his bank account and caught up with emails while hiding his Blackberry under the table during the meeting at Kendal County Hall, Cumbria. Cllr Nicholson, a member for Cockermouth North, spoke only to mutter 'hear, hear' in approval of the decision to take a lunch break. Distracted: Eric Nicholson was photographed as he played solitaire, checked his bank account and caught up with emails while hiding his Blackberry under the table during the town hall meeting . He put his phone away after lunch but was seen doodling on the agenda papers during the afternoon session. Cllr Nicholson, who was elected in 1997, admitted after the meeting that he had been playing solitaire, checking his bank account and looking at emails, but insisted he was still 'concentrating'. He said: 'What you've got to understand is I get these papers a week before the meeting. I know them inside out. I don't think it truly affected anything I needed to concentrate on. 'I listened to [the debate] carefully. I'm the type of guy that gets terribly bored and switch off. I can lose my focus. It sounds silly but I'm so used to working at 100mph. I know it gives a bad impression.' The incident is the latest in a string of embarrassments for local councillors, who have been caught playing computer games during important meetings and phoning sex lines on company phones. Cllr Nicholson's actions were criticised a local government watchdog, who described it as an 'insult' to voters. Councillor Nicholson, right, put his phone away after lunch but was seen doodling on the agenda papers during the afternoon session, left. He insisted he was still 'concentrating' throughout the meeting . Steven Atkinson, of Is It Fair Cumbria, said: 'It just shows the seriousness with which [councillors] take the debate. They don't care. 'It's an absolute insult to the people who elected him to put him in that position. 'He should make his apologies and attempt to explain himself to the electorate as I doubt they want a person who's more interested in their mobile phone than the budget - it's appalling. 'No wonder there's such apathy from voters.' Labour Councillor Len Davies, Mayor of Allerdale, added that Cllr Nicholson had 'let down those who had trusted him to act on their behalf'. He said: 'An apology would be appropriate. He's certainly not acting with due diligence. 'To prevent this happening again there must be a clear message that councillors must focus on what's being discussed.' Councillor James Airey, leader of the Conservative Group for Cumbria County Council, said he was 'surprised' by Cllr Nicholson because he had 'helped a lot' in drawing up the budget proposals being discussed. He added that he had seen members from all parties losing concentration during debates. He said: 'Members from all parties were reading newspapers at one point. We have got to sharpen our act up. It was an important debate and people should fully concentrate.' When asked if Cllr Nicholson would be punished, Cllr Airey said: 'I spoke to Eric and he has apologised. 'He was aware of everything that went on in the budget debate and he has promised me that he won’t do any personal work in important council debates again.' It comes two months after Tory MP Nigel Mills admitted having a ‘game or two’ of Candy Crush on his taxpayer-funded iPad during an important meeting in Parliament. Debate: Cllr Nicholson was attending a council tax meeting at Kendal County Hall, Cumbria, pictured . Mr Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee in December. However, he spent much of the two-and-a-half-hour meeting closely studying his iPad and swiping the screen as he tried to complete levels of the popular game. And last month it emerged Robert Bleakley, who has an £11,000 allowance as a representative of Tyldesley in Wigan, Greater Manchester, had run up a £2,500 bill calling sex chatlines. The Independent councillor also used a work computer to watch pornography and did not bother attending a meeting in five months. In September it was discovered Councillor Robert Bleakley, a representative of Tyldesley in Wigan, Greater Manchester, had racked up a £2,400 taxpayer-funded phone bill after sending vile messages and calling premium rate sex lines.","Eric Nicholson was photographed using his mobile phone under the table .

"David Cameron’s promise to curb immigration was shattered yesterday by figures revealing it has hit the highest level on record. Annual net migration – the measure of how many people have come into Britain minus those who have left – has reached nearly 300,000. When he took power in 2010 Mr Cameron pledged to bring this politically sensitive figure below 100,000. A total of 624,000 people migrated to Britain in the 12 months up to last September while 327,000 left. The inflow is up 94,000 on the year before. Last year 300,000 migrants arrived in Britain, with 190,000 of them travelled from outside the EU . Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . The fact that most of the extra migrants – 190,000 of the net inflow of 298,000 – came from countries outside the EU provides further embarrassment for the Prime Minister. Unlike EU citizens, these people have no automatic right to work here and the Government had pledged to slash their numbers. There were increasing numbers of arrivals from the Indian sub-continent and a rise in ‘chain migration’ where existing migrants bring in their relatives. Opposition politicians said Mr Cameron’s immigration policy was ‘in tatters’ and pro-immigration pressure groups said he should instead focus on improving the lives of new arrivals. Labour MP Frank Field said last night: ‘Every set of immigration data reinforces the need to control our borders. ‘How can one expect a country to maintain its common identity and memories when in one year the population change alone was almost one million people – 327,000 leaving and 624,000 arriving. ‘That’s over a one-seventieth change in the entire population. 'At this rate in the next parliament it’ll be the equivalent to the whole of inner London’s population being changed.’ Downing Street described the figures as a ‘disappointment’ but also a reflection of a strong economy. The highest numbers previously recorded were 600,000 in September 2010. When Mr Cameron entered Downing Street in May 2010 net migration was running at 244,000. Net migration from the EU hit 162,000 in the year ending September 2014, up from 130,000 in the previous year . A total of 37,000 Romanian and Bulgarian arrived in the UK, up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months . 'We would like to see net immigration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands.' David Cameron, Jan 2010 . 'Levels of immigration can return to where they were in the 1980s and 90s. Net migration to this country will be in the order of tens of thousands each year. No ifs. No buts. That's a promise we made to the British people.' David Cameron, April 2011 . 'When we made that comment ... we were very clear that was what we wanted to do. It remains the objective towards which the Prime Minister and others are working.' Theresa May, Nov 10 . 'It is, of course, unlikely that we are going to reach the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament.' Theresa May, Nov 23 . Yesterday’s 298,000 figure has been surpassed only once, in 2005. While eastern European immigration remains steady, the majority of EU migrants now come from Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and France, which all have moribund economies and high youth unemployment. The figures also show that nearly 200,000 Romanians and Bulgarians applied for national insurance numbers to work in the UK in 2014.Yet only 37,000 were registered as arriving in the 12 months to September of that year – suggesting that tens of thousands were here before the lifting of labour restrictions that January. Phoebe Griffith, of the Labour-leaning IPPR think tank, said: ‘In light of these numbers, the Government urgently needs to broaden its focus to the experiences and impact of migrants once they arrive. ‘They need to do more to address the pressures of immigration, including on local authorities, schools, GPs and social cohesion.’ Prime Minister David Cameron promised before the election to cut net immigration in the tens of thousands . But Lord Green of Migration Watch UK, a campaign group which has a record of accurate projections of immigration, said: ‘These figures will be extremely disappointing for the public. The additional pressure on housing and public services is clearly unmanageable. This outcome is a wake-up call to redouble efforts to tackle mass immigration.’ He added: ‘If political leaders are content with net migration of 300,000, they should say so. Otherwise they should pledge to continue with a target and set out policies to achieve it. ‘A problem as serious as this requires serious money. ‘We call on all political parties to double the resources available for immigration control, which now account for only 0.25 per cent of Government expenditure.’ A new poll today showed people are most concerned about the impact of immigration on the NHS and the economy . In an interview with Woman & Home magazine, Mr Cameron defended his policy and blamed the booming British economy for attracting workers from around the world. 'Outside the EU, immigration has come down, thanks to the action we have taken since 2010, for example, closing down 700 bogus colleges. 'But inside the EU, migration has gone up, partly because Britain's economy has been strong and we've been creating 1,000 new jobs a day, which is why I have put forward tough welfare policies that I will secure as part of our renegotiation with the EU. 'There are four parts to it – firstly, if someone comes to the UK from the EU to look for work, they do not get unemployment benefit. 'Secondly, if they have not found work after six months, they will be forced to return home. Thirdly, if they do find work here they will not be able to claim in-work benefits like tax credits or social housing for four years. And fourthly they will no longer be able to send home child benefit to their country of origin.' Mr Cameron has claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue . Mr Cameron had hoped to use his immigration speech last year to announce a cap on the numbers of people who can come to Britain from elsewhere in the EU. But the idea was jettisoned by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who insisted there could be no question of altering freedom of movement rules. Phoebe Griffith, from the IPPR think tank, said: 'These figures confirm that the net migration target has failed. In light of these numbers, the government urgently needs to broaden its focus to the experiences and impact of migrants once they arrive in Britain. 'They need to do more to address the pressures of immigration, including on local authorities, schools, GPs and social cohesion.' No wonder they tried to bury the bad news . ANALYSIS BY JAMES SLACK . Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured, had long-since downgraded the Prime Minister's immigration pledge to 'a comment' Little wonder that officials tried so cynically to bury yesterday’s immigration figures beneath the findings of the Jimmy Savile inquiry. For, no matter how hard the Tories might look, there wasn’t a crumb of comfort to be found for David Cameron. For more than two years, it had been apparent he would miss his 2010 election promise to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. The lowest total the Government ever achieved was 154,000 in September 2012 and since then it has been rising steadily. Indeed, Theresa May – knowing failure was inevitable – had long since downgraded the Prime Minister’s pledge to a ‘comment’. But the excuse the Tories could always fall back on was that it was all the fault of the EU and free movement directives that Mr Cameron plans to renegotiate, if the Germans will let him. Migration from outside the EU – which they could control – had been cut sharply, ministers insisted. Yesterday that fig leaf was pulled away as the number of incomers rose in every significant category. Immigration for the purposes of study was up from 175,000 to 192,000 in the year to September 2014. The number getting visas for family reunion – including weddings – was up from 66,000 to 90,000. Asylum applications rose by 6 per cent to 24,914. Overall, net migration from outside the EU was 190,000. In other words, if EU migration had not added a single person to the UK population, Mr Cameron would still have missed his ‘tens of thousands’ target by 90,000. It’s hard to think of an election promise being broken more spectacularly. Home Secretary Mrs May did try. Hundreds of bogus colleges were closed down, sham marriages were disrupted and it was made far harder to get a family reunion visa. But the immigration system remains like a balloon: squeeze one route into the UK and a bulge appears elsewhere. Mrs May was also opposed in her reforms every step of the way by the Treasury, the Business Department and the vocal universities sector – all of which are convinced mass immigration is the only route to prosperity.","Prime Minister  promised voters to cut net migration: 'No ifs.

"Posing for the camera before her school prom, Corah-Beth Slaney is the picture of a pretty, fresh-faced English rose. But just one month later, the 16-year-old's body had been ravaged by a deadly condition - and doctors have now warned she has just months to live. In the space of a few weeks, the glamorous teenager became unable to walk, feed or wash herself. She has since been diagnosed with mitochondrial disease - a life limiting disease that prevents the body from producing energy for vital organs and muscles. And since the prom night, Corah's devastated parents have watched helplessly as the disease has taken over her body. Corah-Beth Slaney posing for the camera before going to her school prom. But just one month later, the 16-year-old was battling a deadly condition that had ravaged her body - and now has just months to live . Her parents watched in horror as within the space of a few weeks, the glamorous teenager became unable to walk, feed or wash herself . Her mother, Lisa, 43, said: 'After her prom night, Corah's health rapidly declined - and she's now unable to walk, feed or wash herself. 'Mitochondrial disease has devastated our lives and it's so rare that there's not much information about it. 'Doctors have warned us that Corah has months to live rather than years and we're just trying to make the most out of our time left as a family. 'It was heart-breaking to hear that our little girl had such an awful, terminal disease.' For her parents, the picture of Corah at the prom is a 'precious', yet tragic reminder of the daughter they have lost. Mrs Slaney said: 'Corah's prom night is something we will treasure forever, it reminds us of the happy times we've shared. 'But despite her diagnosis she has never stopped smiling and still manages to try and sing when she's feeling well enough.' 'She is my only daughter as I have two older sons which makes this even harder for us to take.' 'Her condition means we are living on a timebomb we don't know how long we have left as a family. Corah, with her mother Lisa, has since been diagnosed with mitochondrial disease - a life limiting condition that prevents the body from producing energy for vital organs and muscles . For her parents Lisa and Carl, the picture of Corah at the prom is a 'precious', yet tragic reminder of the daughter they have lost. Her mother said: 'Mitochondrial disease has devastated our lives' What are mitochondria? In every cell in the body, mitochondria are responsible for producing energy (called ATP) that the cell needs to function. Cells make up tissues and organs in our bodies, for example the heart and liver. They are like power stations in our bodies, supplying the energy every cell needs to function. If our cells do not have energy, then the tissues or body organs that the cells are made up of do not work properly. One analogy is that if power stations do not produce enough energy for the country, there will be areas of blackout, where parts of the country cannot function. What is mitochondrial Disease? When a person has mitochondrial Disease the Mitochondria in the cells are not producing enough energy for the cell. Sometimes they do not work at all, and sometimes they are just not very efficient. If a cell does not get enough energy (ATP) it cannot function properly. There is a huge variety in the symptoms and severity of mitochondrial disease. It depends on how many cells are affected, and where they are in the body - so every person with mitochondrial disease is affected differently. Each individual affected will have a different combination of mitochondria that are working and not working within each cell. However, there are times when particular body systems are affected in a recognisable pattern and these have particular names, for example Alpers, Leigh’s disease, MELAS and MERRF. The commonest parts of the body affected are those that have the highest energy demands; brain, muscle, liver, heart and kidney. If a lot of mitochondria in the body are affected in the important body organs, like the brain, mitochondrial disease can be very serious. The symptoms of mitochondrial disease are usually progressive in body systems where the cells have a high demand for energy, such as brain cells. Source: The Lily Foundation . 'Corah's mind works perfectly fine so it's such a shame that at 16-years-old she relies on me to wash and dress her. 'We are just trying to make sure she has the best quality of life while she's still with us.' Doctors were at first baffled by Corah's symptoms but just one month later her parents were told the devastating news. The teenager's health had been fine until she was 12 years old. But in 2011, she developed diabetes and needed insulin with every meal. She then started suffering from seizures and was diagnosed with epilepsy. Her mother said: 'Corah's life had suddenly changed overnight and now her father and I had to help manage her health. 'That was devastating enough, but when her seizures started getting worse, we knew something wasn't adding up.' 'But it took years of hospital appointments before we got an accurate diagnosis - and the medication she was on failed to stop her having fits.' In June 2014, Corah, from Nottingham, was due to undergo life-changing brain surgery to help control her seizures. In preparation, Corah needed to be taken off all medication for this to be carried out - something that led to massive, uncontrollable fits. Mrs Slaney added: 'It wasn't until a specialist suggested that Corah may have mitochondrial disease that I had ever heard of it. 'A muscle biopsy was taken and it was then confirmed that Corah had this horrible disease.' The teenager's parents are now desperate to raise as much awareness as possible for the condition that will kill their daughter. They are currently waiting to go to Great Ormond Street to talk with consultants about the best drugs available to help her. Mrs Slaney said: said: 'Corah took a massive turn for the worst in December, she suffered a huge seizure and we all thought she was going to die.' Mitochondrial disease causes extreme tiredness, as well as involuntary movements. The seizures have left Corah with muscle weakness and she is now wheelchair bound. Corah's mother is now her full-time carer. She said: 'Corah's mind works perfectly fine so it's such a shame that at 16, she relies on me to wash and dress her' Desperate to spend as much time with her daughter as possible, her mother had taken up the role of Corah's full time carer. 'We're trying to get Corah to feed herself again, which would be amazing. But we don't know what's going to happen, so we just take each day as it comes.' Since Corah's diagnosis, the family have been doing all they can to keep her spirits up. Mrs Slaney added: 'Corah recently met Jessie J which really helped lift her spirits, she loves singing so it was fantastic for her to meet her idol. 'We're in the process of trying to get as many people as possible to send Corah video messages to cheer her up, she loves Keith Lemon.' Despite the family struggling to cope with Corah's shocking diagnosis, they are sharing her story in the hope of some way improving the lives of others with the terminal condition. The family has spoken out to try and raise awareness of the cruel condition that has wrecked Cora's life . Mrs Slaney said: 'Corah is constantly deteriorating and now that she can't do anything for herself. We are on the waiting list to get a wet room in our house. 'Originally the council placed Corah at the bottom of a two-year waiting list, but thanks to our supporters we are now at the top of that list. 'But unfortunately no funding will be available until April and even then, the work is likely to exceed the maximum grants available.' So the family have set up a fundraising page for Corah in a bid to raise the vital funds for her wet room and downstairs bedroom. Mrs Slaney added: 'I want to ensure Corah has the best quality of life possible and having her own downstairs area at home would greatly improve that. 'In just over two weeks we've raised over £7,000.' To help the family with their fundraising, visit: www.gofundme.com/SingASong4Corah . The family have pledged that any surplus funds will be donate to The Lily Foundation, which helps research into mitochondrial disease and other metabolic disorders.

"When Honey-Rae Phillips was born with a giant strawberry birthmark, her mother and father wanted to show she was just like everyone else. But their act of devotion has gone beyond even the most caring parents' wildest dreams. Tanya and Adam Phillips each adorned their legs with mammoth tattoos, mimicking perfectly the blemishes which run up the right side of their 18-month-old daughter's body. Devotion: Honey-Rae Phillips (centre) was born with a harmless but disfiguring strawberry birthmark - so to show she is just like everyone else, her parents have each had tattoos of the same blotches (left and right) Supportive: Father Adam Phillips and his wife Tanya constantly tell Honey-Rae (left) that she is beautiful . The proud couple, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, were in tears when they first saw Honey-Rae after she was born in 2013. Although her strawberry birthmark is completely harmless, they were afraid the skin blotches - which affect one in ten children - could harm Honey-Rae's self-confidence when she grew up. When her daughter was barely a year old, Mrs Phillips was horrified to discover pensioners pointing at her and whispering next to a shop till. So for Christmas she paid for the two-and-a-half-hour, £80 procedure on her husband's leg - with plasterer Mr Phillips repaying the favour ahead of her 40th birthday this week. Mark: Mrs Phillips already had a tattoo on her right leg, but has added to what she had before . Mrs Phillips said: ‘Most people might think it’s very extreme but to us it was the natural thing to do to ensure our daughter never felt different or alone in the world.’ Recounting the moment she first saw her daughter's birthmark, the proud mother said ‘She struggled to breathe when she was first born and was rushed to the special care unit. When I went to see her she was just lying in a little incubator and that’s when I saw it. 'It broke my heart. I just sobbed and sobbed knowing my baby was going to permanently marked for the rest of her life. ‘Like any mum I didn’t want her to be different. I wanted her to be exactly the same as every other healthy child. And as much as the birthmark isn’t dangerous, I knew it could have a huge impact on the rest of her life. ‘Although in our eyes she was perfect, I knew other people would cruelly point and stare at her. For the first few months of her life, whenever we went out, I made sure her legs were covered up. I couldn’t cope with stranger’s curious glances or whispering comments.’ ‘I didn’t want sympathy or pity or people feeling sorry for Honey-Rae. Adam and I decided straight away that we wanted Honey-Rae to feel special, that her birthmark was something to feel proud of and not embarrassed by. 'From the moment she was born, we told Honey-Rae she was beautiful and constantly covered her in kisses.' But when she noticed an elderly couple 'whispering and staring' at her daughter, Mrs Phillips was 'distraught' and decided she had to take action. 'It was the first time I had taken her out without covering her up and it confirmed all my worries and fears,' she said. 'People are cruel without even realising. And I knew if adults could be that insensitive, then kids at school would also be unintentionally mean. ‘We had talked about having duplicate tattoos done for a little while but that day my mind was made up. We knew we had to do something to ensure Honey-Rae grew up knowing she was very much loved.’ Mark: Honey-Rae's birthmark, pictured, is harmless but caused strangers to whisper at a shop checkout . She added: ‘It was incredibly painful, especially as I had a flower to cover some old star tattoos, but it was worth every second of the pain. ‘When the swelling went down, I showed Honey-Rae, and she gently touched it and smiled as she said “Match”, pointing to her own leg. ‘If I’d have needed any reassurance that I’d made the right decision that was it. ‘She now constantly touches mine and Adam’s tattoos then her own birthmark and giggles - I couldn’t be happier. ‘Some people will says it odd and think what we’ve done is quite extreme, but in our eyes all we have done is ensure Honey-Rae never feels different. Mummy and Daddy now have the same permanent markings as she does.’ Condition: Known medically as haemangiomas, strawberry birthmarks are an abnormal cluster of blood vessels just under the skin. They affect one in ten babies but most of the time they are completely harmless . The couple already had tattoos on their legs, but none as extreme as the imitation birthmarks. Known medically as haemangiomas, strawberry birthmarks are an abnormal cluster of blood vessels just under the skin which can vary hugely in size. They get their name from their appearance, which can mimic the pattern and colouring of the summer fruit. Most are harmless and do not need to be treated, with some types fading over time while others stay on the skin permanently. Occasionally birthmarks need to be treated if they develop into ulcers or block the airways, but other people have them removed for cosmetic reasons. Many can be removed with medicines, while others require laser treatment or even plastic surgery, according to the NHS.","Honey-Rae Phillips was born with harmless but disfiguring birthmark .

"Booted: UMass Amherst doctoral student Zahra Khalkhali was unceremoniously kicked out of her school and stripped of her visa . Behind UMass-Amherst's infamous ban on Iranian students studying at the university is a 31-year-old doctoral student from outside Tehran whose experience sparked the entire controversy. Zahra Khalkhali was a second year PhD student whose research on fuel cells concerned university officials enough to drop her from the university late last year along with their sponsorship of her visa while she was visiting her home country. While Khalkhali languished in Iran with little explanation and no one willing to help her, UMass-Amherst rewrote its policies concerning Iranian students. Officials said the change was made to better conform to a 2012 federal law that makes Iranian citizens who are seeking degrees to prepare them for work in their country's energy sector ineligible for visas. 'I was very shocked and heartbroken,' Khalkhali told NBC News in a phone interview from Iran. Before this year's chain of events, Khalkhali was a student in the highly regarded university's Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department. She was in her second year of study into fuel cells used to produce clean energy when she unceremoniously got the boot. 'They were all aware of my research,' she says of her administrators and colleagues. 'The university was aware what my PhD thesis was about.' Nonetheless, she says she could find no one to vouch for her as she attempted to return to the country. So, hoping to convince the university in person, she flew to New York. On January 14, NBC reports, Khalkhali was stopped at a New York airport, cuffed and held overnight before being shipped back to Iran. Later in January, she would petition UMass to reconsider. Instead, the school hardened its policies regarding Iranian students. Upon trying to return to the U.S. following a trip home to Iran, officials saw that Khalkhali's research at the university's Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department involved energy production. The school feared ran counter to a 2012 federal law barring Iranian nationals in pursuit of degrees that could train them to work in their country's energy sector from getting visas . On February 6, the school officially banned Iranians from studying many hard science fields, some of which weren't even specified by the 2012 federal law. At the time, the school claimed the policy change stemmed from 'an inquiry from a student.' An outcry soon ensued from within Amherst and without as critics called foul on what they claimed were draconian new policies. Then, on February 18, the school turned heel, deciding to reverse its decision to ban Iranian nationals from admission to certain graduate programs after consulting further with the State Department and private attorneys. 'We have always believed that excluding students from admission conflicts with our institutional values and principles. It is now clear, after further consultation and deliberation, that we can adopt a less restrictive policy,' said Michael Malone, vice chancellor for research and engagement. The university said it will develop individualized study plans based on a student's projected coursework to meet the requirements of federal sanctions law. Khalkhali, meanwhile, remains in limbo in Iran. However, UMass Chancellor Kumble R. Subbaswamy said in a statement to NBC on Tuesday: . 'The student did not do anything wrong, and we regret that she endured a difficult and trying period at the airport. 'We are exploring how we might help her continue her education, and if we can identify an alternative line of study that fulfills the requirements of federal law.'","Zahra Khalkhali is a 31-year-old Iranian national whose doctoral research on fuel cells got her booted from UMass .
Khalkhali was banned from returning to the US early this year after UMass dropped its sponsorship of her visa while she was visiting home .
After dropping her, UMass rewrote its policies to protect the school from a 2012 law banning Iranians from training for careers in Iran's energy sector .
The school has since turned heel on its policy, but Khalkhali remains stuck in Iran ."
"Every mobile phone user in Pakistan is being ordered to have their fingerpints taken as part of the country's tough new anti-terror laws. Every citizen who wants to use a device must make sure their name, phone number and finger prints are on record in order to keep their SIM card. Since the new measure was announced earlier this year, Pakistanis have been lining up at mobile phone stores and in front of vans and kiosks to have their fingerprints scanned so their identities can be verified, meaning they can keep their phones. People line up in front of a street trader in Islamabad to have their SIM cards verified by giving their fingerprints . The measures are meant to tighten control of mobile phones and stop them being used in terror attacks following a Taliban massacre at a school in Peshawar two months ago, which left 150 dead. For user to keep their phones, they have to go to a kiosk and show their ID while having their fingerprints scanned. If the fingerprint matches up with one on a government database, they are allowed to keep their SIM card. If not, their service is cut off. Last year, the Pakistani government introduced biometric machines designed to check users' identities - making the check mandatory for anyone who wants to get a new SIM card. But in the wake of the Peshawar attack, they're now checking all users, regardless of when they got their SIM card, to make sure those who have been issued with one, are actually the ones using it. The measures are meant to tighten control of mobile phones and stop them being used in terror attacks in the country . The project has been portrayed as a way to curb the use of cellphones by militants and criminals in planning or carrying out attacks. In explaining the measure, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told lawmakers earlier this month that he was sure the terrorists 'will lose a big weapon.' A police official investigating the Peshawar attack said at least two of the SIM cards recovered from the scene were issued under the names of two residents of Punjab province and the pair later told authorities their names were misused. There are about 103 million SIM card holders in Pakistan and the goal is to re-check everyone by April 13, said a spokesman for the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority. Pakistan's five cellular companies worked with the PTA to install fingerprint scanning devices around the country, and already about 60 million SIM cards have been verified and seven million blocked. Every citizen in Pakistan who wants to use a device must make sure their name, phone number and finger prints are on record in order to keep their SIM card . Mobile phone companies have launched advertising campaigns and sent mobile vans around the country to win the people over. Their websites warn SIM card holders of impending cut off dates. And while some Pakistanis are frazzled at the added bureaucracy, others agree the measure could help curb illegal cellphone usage. Hussain Khan who had to wait for 40 minutes at a cellphone company office in Islamabad said: 'Those who have some bad intentions and are misusing cellphones will not turn up for this verification. They know how to get their way. But Badshah Hussain, a 38-year-old vegetable vendor, was a bit more upbeat saying: 'This will not only help curb crime and terrorism but also protect people from ... problems and troubles.'","Mobile phone owners have to record their name, number and fingerprints .

"The images of European cities left smouldering and in ruins at the end of the Second World War have been starkly echoed in new pictures revealing wholesale devastation across eastern Ukraine. Heavily shelled tower blocks, abandoned hotels and airplane noses that look to have dropped from the sky are among the sights depicting the destruction in Donetsk, which in parts equals that seen after the Second World War in cities such as Stalingrad and Dresden. It comes as heavy weaponry was today towed away from the front line at the village of Paraskoviyvka, north of the government stronghold of Artemivsk, in a move that signified a France and Germany-brokered ceasefire may be beginning to take hold 11 days after it was agreed. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: A shell of a car lies among dead trees in front of heavily shelled tower blocks in Donetsk . Ruins: A heavily damaged hotel stands in ruins near to Donetsk airport in Donetsk, Ukraine . Crushed: A tank can be seen among the shattered buildings in the industrial city of Donetsk that was at the centre of the fighting . A direction sign at Donetsk airport is left riddled with bullet holes, while huge blast craters can be seen on a nearby building . On guard: A separatist soldier stands close to a ruined hotel in Donetsk as weapons were moved away from the front line . A partially collapsed building sits amid the barren landscape after the area surrounding the airport was left ravaged by months of shelling . The move to withdrawn heavy weaponry was Kiev's most direct step to acknowledge that the ceasefire was finally holding, a week after suffering one of the worst defeats of the war at the hands of rebels who initially ignored the ceasefire to launch a major advance. The pro-Russian rebels, who committed to the truce after their successful offensive, have been pulling back heavy weapons for two days, but Kiev had until now held back from implementing the withdrawal, arguing that fighting had not yet ceased. However, the army today reported no combat fatalities at the front for a second straight day - the first time no troops have been killed since long before the French and German-brokered truce was meant to take effect. The withdrawal of artillery is 'point two' of the peace agreement reached in the Belarus capital Minsk, so it amounts to an acknowledgement that 'point one' - the ceasefire itself - is being observed. 'Today Ukraine has begun the withdrawal of 100 millimetre guns from the line of confrontation,' the military said in a statement, saying the step would be monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It said it reserved the right to alter the schedule of withdrawal 'in the event of any attempted offensive'.

The airport has been left in ruins, with collapsed roofs and walls burying soldiers after months of shelling and fighting . Witnesses in rebel-held Donetsk said they had heard no artillery in the night although the occasional distant blast or gunshot could be heard during the day. Rebels brought Ukrainian war prisoners to the ruins of the airport on the north of the town to recover the dead bodies of their fellow Ukrainian troops, left buried in the wreckage since the terminal was captured in January. Rebels also carried out controlled explosions to blast holes through walls inside the ruined terminal and sent the prisoners down a ladder where the floor had collapsed. Three dead bodies still lay at the site out of five that had been recovered from the debris yesterday. Prisoners said they were searching for three more they believed were still buried. The commander of the separatist 'Sparta' battalion, going by the nom de guerre 'Motorola', said the prisoners had been assigned the task because 'it's not our job to recover dead bodies, it's our job to make them. 'They take their comrades out to return them to their mums and dads. Did they think we would feed them for free?'

On the left is its base, while metres to the right sits the turret . The battle of Stalingrad (pictured), which took place during the Second World War, was a prolonged and entrenched battle which left much of the Russian city in ruins . Donetsk airport has been a totemic battlefield for both sides. Ukrainian troops had held out there for months until the rebels assaulted it after abandoning a previous ceasefire agreed in September. The separatist rebels initially ignored the new truce last week to launch an advance that led to one of the biggest battles of a war that has killed more than 5,600 people. But since capturing the strategic town of Debaltseve, where the rebels said the truce did not apply, they have taken pains to emphasise that they now intend to abide by it. Western countries denounced the rebels and their presumed sponsor, Russian President Vladimir Putin, for advancing on Debaltseve after the truce was meant to take effect. But they have since held out hope that the ceasefire will now hold, with the rebels having achieved that objective. In the days after its troops were driven from Debaltseve, Kiev maintained that it believed the rebels were reinforcing for another advance, particularly expressing fear for the city of Mariupol, a port of 500,000 people. Western countries have threatened to impose new economic sanctions on Moscow if the rebels advance further into territory the Kremlin calls 'New Russia'. Moscow, which denies aiding its sympathisers in Ukraine, said today the threats of more sanctions were cover for Western efforts to undermine the truce. 'It's an attempt to... distract attention from the necessity to fulfil the conditions of the Minsk agreements,' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Vladimir Putin . and his Cypriot counterpart Nicos Anastasiades signed an . agreement to give Russian military ships access to . Cypriot ports.

Her 46-year-old mother Jane, a full-time carer for Eve, described her daughter as 'unforgettable' and a self-confessed geek who dreamed of one day working in the media. She said: 'She was individual. She did Eve's things and it didn't matter what you said to her she would still do Eve's things. 'She knew her own mind and it's a shame more kids don't feel strong enough and comfortable enough to be like Eve in that way.' She added that the service had been a celebration of Eve's short life and had included songs Thinking Out Loud by Ed Sheeran, Blame It on Me by George Ezra, It's a Beautiful Day by Michael Bublé and Take me to Church by Hozier. Hundreds attended the funeral, forcing church wardens to open the adjoining hall.

"A grandmother who complained of neck pain after a fall died after medics repeatedly failed to take her to hospital - instead telling her to take paracetamol. Ruby Rice, 89, of North Walsham, Norfolk, did in fact have a broken neck - and died after becoming paralysed from the neck down as a result of the fall. Her devastated son Paul, 55, said paramedics and her GP were called several times but she was simply told to 'take paracetamol'. She was not taken to hospital for X-rays until November 19th - about three weeks after the fall which caused the fracture to her neck. Ruby Rice, 89, died after becoming paralysed from the neck down as a result of the fall . Mr Rice wants a review into procedures and policies around when a patient should be transported to hospital for further assessment, and has written to the Care Quality Commission health watchdog. East of England Ambulance Service and Mrs Rice's GP surgery have offered their sympathies and encouraged her family to contact them to discuss concerns. Mr Rice said: 'I am not apportioning blame to the crews. I am concerned about policy. 'My mother had osteoporosis and brittle bones - they should have acted.' The ambulance service was first called on November 13 when Mrs Rice fell in the hallway of her home. The medical report stated the slip caused 'slight' discomfort to her neck and no injury was discovered. The next day, a GP visited her at home, having been contacted about Mrs Rice's neck pain.

The following day, she was referred back to her GP for a medical review and took paracetamol for her neck pain. On November 19th, following yet another fall in her kitchen, she was finally taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken pelvis and an 'historic break' to her neck. After a long stay in hospital, she was discharged to a care home in North Walsham, but became paralysed from the neck down. She died on February 3rd.

"The BBC’s reporting of the Falklands War was considered so ‘treacherous’ by senior Tories that the Corporation only narrowly escaped a Government takeover, an official history reveals. Margaret Thatcher’s right hand man, Willie Whitelaw, was under huge pressure to invoke emergency protocols normally reserved for a nuclear attack against Britain in 1982. This would have allowed the Government to take charge of what was being broadcast about the Falklands conflict to protect Britain’s national interests and the morale of the country and the troops. Margaret Thatcher, pictured, was so outraged by the BBC's coverage of the Falklands War, she wanted to use emergency powers to take the corporation under the Government's control according to an official history . Mrs Thatcher, right, wanted her right-hand-man Willie Whitelaw, left, to move against the BBC . In a history of the BBC, published today, it emerges that Mrs Thatcher was incandescent with the BBC for apparently questioning support for the war and even refusing to call soldiers ‘our boys’. Inside Downing Street, there was particular fury at a May 1982 edition of Panorama which gave a platform to the war’s critics at Westminster and implied that senior military figures also had reservations about it. The Prime Minister, who had staked he political reputation on reclaiming the islands from Argentina, believed that – during the crucial second month of the conflict - the BBC had ‘exaggerated the case of a few dissidents. Her view, according to official historian Jean Seaton of the University of Westminster, was that it had let down ‘the Army, the country and her’. Her husband, Denis, later remarked: ‘I will never forget it. How could the bloody BBC question the integrity of the military? I was livid with rage and have hated them since that day.’ In response to the Panorama programme, the BBC’s soon-to-be director general, Alasdair Milne, and chairman Lord Howard were summoned to appear before a meeting of the Tory MPs’ Media Committee. The meeting was called by Home Secretary Mr Whitelaw, whose department was then in charge of overseeing the BBC, to allow Tory MPs to vent their fury. The book says: ‘Whitelaw wanted to ‘let them get it off their chests’. Whitelaw was under immense pressure, however, to use the power that Government’s possessed under the Corporation’s Charter to take it over and to direct what it broadcast. ‘These powers existed to cover the transition to war in a nuclear attack. ‘Whitelaw saw the blood-letting as a last-ditch attempt to protect the BBC from something far worse: government control.’ The BBC refused to refer to British forces heading to the Falklands as 'our boys' which angered Mrs Thatcher . During the meeting, MPs were so furious that one accused the BBC of being ‘obsequious’ to Argentina. In a separate row, Mrs Thatcher also accused the Corporation of ‘treacherously’ calling the troops ‘the British troops’ on Newsnight, rather than ‘us’ or ‘our’. The book, titled Pinkoes and Traitors, reveals this decision was based on official BBC guidelines, which went to everyone at the Corporation. The startling claims are contained withing a new book on the BBC between 1974-1987 . Underlined, this edict stated: ‘NOT OUR TROOPS’. It went on: We should try to avoid using ‘our’ when we mean British. We are not Britain. We are the BBC’. Throughout her time as Conservative leader, Mrs Thatcher was involved in regular clashes with the BBC, which she considered to be over-manned and a mouthpiece for Left-wing propaganda. She complained about bad language, pro-trade union bias and the effect of TV on children. Repeatedly, suggestions were made the BBC should be made to fund itself by screening advertising. The book, which chronicles the Corporation’s history between 1974 and 1987, states: ‘Maladroitly, it [the BBC] fell into the trap of being defined as an ‘enemy’. ‘At numerous levels within the BBC they discussed what to do for her, with her, how to ration her appearances on Savile shows, how to check her capacity to wipe the floor with interrogators’. The history also chronicles how BBC staff were regularly vetted by MI5 to see if they had extremist views or might pose a threat to national security. At one stage, 1,400 people were being checked every year by the Security Service – a defence the Corporation relied upon when under attack from Mrs Thatcher. In January 1980, the Prime Minister forwarded the BBC a letter accusing it of Left-wing bias because of a sequence on Nationwide about the use of flying pickets in a steel dispute. The BBC replied: ‘I expect you will know that anyone with access to programme decisions, and in certain other sensitive areas (about 40% of staff) is vetted at our request by the Security Service. ‘If therefore any ideological extremists slip through it is hardly our fault.’","Margaret Thatcher was outraged over the BBC's coverage of the Falklands .

"Anyone who's ever fancied making like the Caped Crusader can now live out their dream in a fully Batman themed hotel room...even if only for three hours. The Eden Motel in Taiwan has kitted out one of its suites with a Batman double bed, batcave style walls, a Bat-tub and bat TVs and is finding the bat-themed room a real money spinner. Other rooms in the movie-themed hotel are based on other popular films, with a room dedicated to The Mummy, another based on the famous Alcatraz prison and a third building on the popularity of Sherlock Holmes. Budding batmen need only apply for a night in the bat bed ... complete with batphone nearby . But it is the Batman room which has attracted the most interest, say the hotel's owners. Miniature gargoyle figurines that look as if they are from Gotham city are just one of the features of the suite, which can be rented for £40 for three hours. A batsafe, bat mirror... and Batman poster complete the look. Holy hoteliers: Even the Batmobile makes an appearance as a seat in front of the bat mirror . A large flat screen 'Bat TV' also acts as a screen for the floodlit bathtub behind . Bat curios include a bat mirror, poster, 'batsafe' for valuables and various knick knacks for fans . There are a few other rooms also available by the hour - or three hours - for lovers who want a discreet rendezvous. A 'New York, New York' room, a 'Jazz Style' suite and a 'love suite' covered in hearts are also attracting couples who like the idea of checking into a themed hotel. Batman fans commenting on the hotel's website have pointed out that there are several different Batman styles in the room, one of which was used by Michael Keaton, while another is closer to Christian Bale's Batman in The Dark Knight Trilogy. Egyptian splendour: The Mummy-themed room is for fans of the adventure movie starring Brendan Fraser . No escape: The Alcatraz room takes the famous prison as its theme, and comes complete with handcuffs . Simply capital: It's not immediately clear why the London-themed room in the Taiwanese hotel is so called... Something fishy: Comic book creation Aquaman also has a room designed in his honour .

"Ross Mc Ewan, chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, will not take a £1million bonus this year . The chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland has admitted it will still pay 'outrageous' bonuses totalling £421million as the bank posted losses of £3.5billion. Ross McEwan, who took over running the ailing bank in 2012 after it was bailed out by the taxpayer, said he will not take a £1million bonus this year. He conceded that people were 'quite right' to regard the bonuses as outrageous - but said there was nothing he could do to change this  because it was necessary to pay people awards to carry out 'fairly technical' jobs. RBS, which is 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer and was bailed out in 2008, posted a £3.5billion deficit this year - the seventh consecutive year of losses. The losses suffered by the bank now total £50billion. Mr McEwan said the bank had become 'stronger and simpler' but said there was still a long way to go and they were focusing on getting the 'bank back for shareholders, who are effectively the British public.' The chief executive said he had decided not to take his bonus this year because he wanted to focus on getting the bank back to the highest possible standard. He said: 'What I can do is give you the guarantee we are building a really good customer bank and we are centering that bank on the areas that are strong in the UK and in western Europe so we can get it right.' This is the second time Mr McEwan has decided to forgo the annual bonus awarded on top of his salary, which is expected to top £2.7million this year. The company's bonus pool was cut by 21 per cent to £421 million for 2014, but customers have criticised the high award levels. Mr McEwan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme people were 'quite right' to regard the £421 million in bonuses that the bank was handing out as 'outrageous'. 'Yes, and to be quite honest they are right,' he said. 'It's not something I am going to change or can change today. What I can do is focus on this business and you are starting to see the progress we have made after one year.' The bank posted losses of £3.5billion this year - the seventh successive year of losses for RBS . Role-based allowances are designed to allow the banks to get around the EU bonus cap. This came into force on January 1 last year and limits annual payouts for 2014 onwards to 100 per cent of annual salary, or a maximum of 200 per cent with shareholder approval. Mr McEwan, who took over managing the bank from Stephen Hester,  said he understood the issues with the bonuses being paid, but it was important to get fair pay for people to do highly technical jobs. RBS also confirmed that Sir Howard Davies, the former head of the now defunct Financial Services Authority, will be its chairman from September. He replaces Sir Philip Hampton, who is set to join GlaxoSmithKline. Sir Howard Davies, former chairman of the Financial Services Authority (left), will take over the chairmanship of RBS from Sir Philip Hampton (right), who is set to join GlaxoSmithKline, later on this year . In a letter to Sir Howard, Chancellor George Osborne called on the new chairman to ensure the bank's business is 'conducted to the very highest ethical standards' and said he would not expect senior executives to be given bonuses. 'I would also expect that, as in the past, no executive directors or members of the executive committee will receive bonuses, despite improved profitability,' he wrote. 'Given the extraordinary support it has enjoyed in the past from taxpayers, I know you recognise that RBS must remain a backmarker on pay and continue to show responsibility and restraint.' * Chairman of the UK Airports Commission, which is due to recommend where to build a new UK runway shortly after the general election. * He will complete his work with the Airports Commission before taking the role at RBS, when Sir Philip Hampton steps down on September 1. * Sir Howard is also a non-executive director of Prudential and a board member of Morgan Stanley. * 1997 - 2003 - Worked as chairman of the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Sir Howard was a director at LSE . * 2011 - Resigned from his position as director of the London School of Economics after it accepted funding from a foundation linked to the family of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. * The incoming RBS chairman has also been director general of the CBI and chief executive of the Audit Commission. It is the seventh successive year of losses, taking the running total to nearly £50 billion since it was bailed out in 2008. But the bank's losses this year are considerably less than the losses of £9billion the year before. Last year the government warned RBS it should not go ahead with a planned £576million worth of bonuses as it slipped £8.2billion into the red. Mr McEwan also said he could not give a guarantee that there would not be a repeat of scandals such as fixing of the Libor rate. He also said while it would not be months before the bank was able to return to the private sector, it certainly wouldn't be as along as ten years. The bank is cutting some of its overseas business, and Mr McEwan said there would be inevitable job cuts. RBS said the latest loss was attributable to a £4 billion write-down on the value of its US arm Citizens, having recently cut its stake in the business. Operating profits were £3.5 billion - the highest since 2010 - as RBS said it had made significant progress towards building a bank that is 'stronger, simpler and better for both customers and shareholders'. Other one-off items included £2.2 billion of conduct and litigation charges, including £320 million in the fourth quarter relating to the rigging of foreign exchange markets and a further £400 million to cover compensation for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. After news of the £3.5billion profit was released shares initially consolidated at their three-year high above 400p before slipping more than three per cent or 14p to 389.2p. Investec Securities analyst Ian Gordon reiterated his sell rating and noted a bigger-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter of the year.","Royal Bank of Scotland posted £3.5bn losses in seventh successive year .

"Online hit: Navy pilot Christopher Gotke crash-landed one of Britain's last surviving Sea Furys . His skilled crash-landing of a stricken Second World War fighter in front of horrified air show spectators made him a YouTube sensation. Now Lieutenant Commander Christopher Gotke's bravery has been recognised by military chiefs - with the award of the Air Force Cross. The 44-year-old said he was 'shocked and amazed' to receive the medal for his careful flying during the incident on July 31 last year despite serving in the Royal Navy for his entire 23-year career. The pilot was flying a Sea Fury T20 from 1944 in an aerobatic sequence  when its engine began to lose power. He responded immediately by lowering the landing gear and positioning the aircraft for landing, while informing air traffic control that he was in trouble. While he tried to carry out the manoeuvre the engine failed completely, with 21,000 people watching on in horror as the Sea Fury billowed smoke and rapidly lost altitude. In a split second, Lieutenant Commander Gotke decided to fly the aircraft to safety rather than eject and abandon the machine to its fate. By raising the undercarriage he improved the plane's chances of gliding and smoothly handled the plane past the airfield boundary, avoiding disaster. Although it was partly damaged, the aircraft is now being repaired and will fly again 'some time next year'. A video of his landing  has been viewed more than 339,000 times. 'It looks a lot more dramatic from the outside than it felt from the inside,' he said. 'When I was bouncing across the grass it was just like being in a bumper car. 'The safety of the crowd was never a factor because the aircraft was fully controllable.' Horror: Thousands of air show spectators in Cornwall watched last July as the plane developed a fault mid-air . Skill: The experienced pilot decided to try and save the plane at great personal risk instead of ejecting . The father-of-two, who is stationed in Yeovilton, Somerset, joked that his wife Georgia and daughters were only third on his list of calls after the incident. He said: 'The first people I called were the people who look after the aircraft, to tell them I was now looking at a very sad aeroplane on the side of the runway. They thought I was joking. 'The second was the Commodore at the base, saying ""Well, that didn't end up very well"". 'And the third one was to the wife saying ""Had a slight engine issue, won't be back tonight but I won't be flying this weekend"". 'I don't think she was really listening because the kids were playing havoc in the background. 'I said I'd had a rough running engine and she kind of acknowledged it a little bit, but when I called her back I said it was a bit more than just a rough running engine.' Wobble: The plane bounced off the runway like a 'bumper car' before the undercarriage collapsed completely . Come to rest: The pilot, who has been awarded the Air Force Cross, joked his wife was only his third phone call . Rescue: The plane suffered extensive damage but restoration experts are optimistic that it will fly again . There are still three to four Sea Fury planes in the UK. First manufactured by Hawker towards the end of the Second World War, it was the last propeller-driver fighter to serve with the Royal Navy. It was also one of the fastest production single piston-engined aircraft ever built. The Air Force Cross is awarded for 'an act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying, though not in active operations against the enemy'. The pilot was one of 139 men and women from the Army, Navy and RAF who were named on the full Operation Awards list today. The recipients were represented by 14 of the most prominent in a ceremony yesterday at London's Lancaster House before being welcomed at 10 Downing Street. Mingling: The pilot (left) was among 14 of the 139-strong list of honoured men and women who met Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter (right) at a ceremony yesterday at London's Lancaster House .

They included Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey, who has become only the second living soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross since 1969. The 27-year-old also became the second person in his family to be awarded the medal – his second cousin was given the honour 70 years ago. Under fire from 20 Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, the paratrooper raced to give first aid to a wounded officer. Prime Minister David Cameron said he was 'humbled' by the bravery and dedication of the men and women. 'It is absolutely right that Lance Corporal Leakey has been awarded a Victoria Cross,' he said. 'He epitomised valour with his actions on that hillside in Helmand. 'When you hear how events unfolded and the intensity of enemy fire, it is difficult to imagine how one wouldn't be frozen to the spot and yet Lance Corporal Leakey risked his life to run across that barren hillside not just once, but multiple times, to turn the battle and save the lives of comrades. 'That is why he deserves the highest honour for bravery the nation can give.'","Christopher Gotke, 44, was flying Sea Fury at Cornish air show last year .

"President Francois Hollande arrived in the Philippines on Thursday to promote the fight against climate change - but felt he couldn't make his point without the help of two glamorous French actresses. As president of France, Hollande carries a fair amount of clout in political circles, but in this instance he brought Marion Cotillard and Melanie Laurent along to bolster his case. The two-day trip, the first by a French president to the Philippines, is part of Hollande's campaign to build diplomatic momentum ahead of the United Nations event that France will host in December. French President François Hollande walks past a Philippine honour guard as he arrives at a military airbase in Manila .

She's pictured here making a toast to Tourism Secretary Ramon Jimenez . Star power: Melanie Laurent was also in tow. She is pictured here waiting to be seated during a state dinner in honour of Hollande . Hollande gestures as he answers questions from reporters at the Malacanang Presidential Palace in Manila . Hollande says he is determined to 'leave a mark' on history by brokering an historic agreement to contain climate change that would make up for the failure to reach such an accord in Copenhagen in 2009. The Philippines is seen as a frontline state in the battle against climate change, having been battered by relentless storms in recent years that have emerged from the Pacific Ocean and claimed many thousands of lives. These included Super Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest storm ever recorded on land, which left more than 7,350 people dead or missing in November 2013 and which scientists have linked to climate change. Hollande will meet with Philippine President Benigno Aquino on Thursday evening, when they are expected to jointly call on world leaders to ensure that the Paris climate summit is a success. The goal of the planned Paris pact, which must enter into force by 2020, is to limit warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. Scientists warn that on current trends, Earth is on track for double that, or more - a recipe for catastrophic droughts, fiercer storms like Haiyan, and other extreme weather events. However most followers of the UN climate change diplomatic process are sceptical a pact can be secured that will be ambitious enough to achieve the two-degree goal, with rich and poor nations continuing to fight over who should shoulder more of the burden. In an effort to raise awareness about the climate change fight while in the Philippines, Hollande brought with him Oscar winner Marion Cotillard, who has been a long-time campaigner for environment group Greenpeace. Melanie Laurent, another French actress who has had big success in Hollywood, is also part of Hollande's delegation, along with UN climate chief Christiana Figueres. Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I is also travelling with Hollande. In what is shaping up to be the most symbolic and emotional leg of Hollande's trip, he will on Friday visit the small town of Guiuan in eastern Philippines that was devastated when Haiyan hit with winds of up to 315 kilometres (195 miles) an hour. The Aquino government is also warmly embracing Hollande's trip, the first by a French head of state since the two nations established diplomatic relations in 1947, as an endorsement of the Philippines' maturing democracy.

"A U.S. federal judge overturned  the NFL's suspension of Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson on Thursday, saying an arbitrator exceeded his authority in upholding the ban. U.S. district judge David Doty reinstated Peterson following his appeal of a suspension that was imposed last September when the star rusher faced charges of causing reckless or negligent injury to a child. Peterson was banned indefinitely, and at least through April 15, after pleading no contest last November to a misdemeanor charge for whipping his four-year-old son with a tree branch. Scroll down for video . Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson's NFL suspension was overturned on Thursday by a U.S. federal judge, saying an arbitrator exceeded his authority in upholding the ban (file photo) Adrian Peterson was suspended indefinitely, at least through April 15, after he disciplined his four-year-old son with a tree branch, leaving cuts, welts and bruises across his legs (pictured) NFL-appointed arbitrator Harold Henderson upheld the sanction in December, saying the ban was allowed under tougher sanctions for players involved in domestic violence imposed by the league in August in the wake of an incident involving Baltimore running back Ray Rice knocking his then-fiancee unconscious in an Atlantic City casino elevator. But the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) appealed that ruling, saying the incident last May came before the new rules and punishment by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell could not be retroactively applied so Peterson should have been banned for no more than two games under prior policy. 'The NFL responds that Henderson, after a ""careful review"" of the policy and new policy, correctly determined the commissioner had ""broad discretion"" under the collective bargaining agreement to impose the enhanced discipline set forth in the new policy. The court disagrees,' Doty wrote. Henderson 'simply disregarded the law of the shop and in doing so failed to meet his duty' under the collective bargaining agreement, Doty added in his 16-page ruling. The NFL says it will review the decision. It could seek a court injunction to prevent Peterson's reinstatement. 'This is a victory for the rule of law, due process and fairness,' NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said. 'Our collective bargaining agreement has rules for implementation of the personal conduct policy and when those rules are violated, our union always stands up to protect our players' rights.' The NFL can review the federal court's decision. The organization could seek a court ruling to overturn Peterson's reinstatement (pictured on the field in December 2013) Peterson, a 29-year-old Texan, has run for 10,190 yards and 86 touchdowns since joining the NFL, having played only for the Vikings since his league debut in 2007. In 2012, Peterson rushed for 2,097 yards, finishing nine yards shy of breaking Eric Dickerson's all-time record for running yardage in a single NFL season. The Vikings must now decide whether to keep Peterson or trade him. He is set to make $12.75million  next season. While team officials have said they want Peterson back, he has questioned their commitment in the wake of the suspension controversy. CBS Sports and ESPN reported that an angry confrontation between Peterson's agent, Ben Dogra and Vikings vice president of football operations Rob Brzezinski took place at last week's NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, with Dogra reportedly saying Peterson would never play for the Vikings again.","Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson's suspension was overturned on Thursday by a U.S. federal judge .

"No longer content with cute cat cafes, Londoners are now lining up to visit the capital's first ever Owl Bar - where visitors can admire a selection of feathery critters over a cocktail.

We have spent lots of time taking care of animal welfare and making sure the owls will be comfortable.' 'The notion of raising money to protect owls in nature by terrifying owls in captivity is absurd. 'The kindest place for owl enthusiasts to admire these birds is in their natural environment, not at a London nightspot where they're used as props or playthings.' Animal cafes are indeed a growing trend. Hot on its tail, is London's first dog cafe, the Happiness of Hounds, due to open in Shoreditch later this year. The capital's original cat cafe, Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium, a home for rescued cats, has been welcoming hordes of moggie fans since last year. Cat cafes are hugely popular in Asia - there are 100 in Tokyo alone . Establishments are like normal cafes - serving sandwiches and coffee - but are full of cats that roam freely . Marketing itself to the many people in the city who live in small flats and who are unable to keep pets, but want a little bit of relaxing animal attention. 'Our greatest and most important duty is to ensure the happiness and well-being of London’s most loved felines' says its website. The cafe's owners say the venue is designed with 'the emotional and physical needs of our resident rescue cats in mind and we do our utmost to give them the time, space and resources they need to form a harmonious household.' Takako Ishimitsu (r), owner of the cat cafe Neko, watches a young woman and her child play with one of her cats in her cat cafe in Vienna, Austria . Growing trend:  New York's pop-up Cat Cafe by Purina One, which opened last April . At Café Little Zoo in Narashino, just outside Tokyo, owners have taken the animal cafe trend to extremes. Visitors can meet iguanas, falcons and even snakes over a coffee a cake. In Japan, cat cafes are old hat, with eateries and bars now offering the chance for visitors to get up close to dogs, goats, rabbits and even penguins and snakes. But Mimi Bekhechi, UK Director of PETA suggests that animal lovers should avoid these types of cafe, where animals may be distressed or maltreated.

'The loud music and bright lights at nightclubs are extremely stressful to animals. 'Most wild animals hired for tacky PR stunts are carted from venue to venue and live in small cages for the majority of their days. 'They are often victims of harsh, abusive training methods, and when they are no longer useful or get too big, many of them end up abandoned or sold to the highest bidder.

"The UK Government remains tight-lipped over the naming of Jihadi John (pictured, who was revealed today as  Mohammed Emwazi, 26, from west London . Questions were being asked today about why it was left to the U.S. Government to reveal the identity of Jihadi John instead of British authorities. The UK Government remains tight-lipped over the naming of the terror suspect who was revealed today as 26-year-old Mohammed Emwazi, from Queen's Park in west London. Emwazi, who studied computer programming at the University of Westminster before travelling to the Middle East three years ago, was confirmed as the prominent ISIS figure by two U.S. Government sources. However, while Whitehall sources confirmed Emwazi had been known to security services for several weeks, the Home Office would not release any confirmation of his identity. Government sources said his name had not been made public because the priority was to try and locate him. The Home Office said it was 'unable to comment' when contacted by MailOnline today, while Metropolitan Police has yet to respond to requests for comment. Downing Street also refused to comment on Emwazi, including claims that he had contacts with MI5. A Number 10 spokesman said: 'Our long-standing position on Jihadi John's identity is that we are neither confirming nor denying. 'There is an ongoing police investigation, we are not going to give a running commentary on that.' Pressed on the claims Emwazi had contact with MI5, the spokesman said: 'You are asking me to speculate about speculation. 'What's right is we let the police and security services do their work in an ongoing investigation to bring these murderers to justice.' Police could be seen attending Emwazi's home in Queen's Park earlier today, but no officers spoke to the media. Despite official sources failing to confirm his identity, it is understood Paul Henning - the brother of British aid worker Alan who was beheaded by Jihadi John - was aware of the ISIS militant's identity. It is also believed that he was made aware by Government officials that the name would released to the public today. Jihadi John's identity was first published by the Washington Post, who reported that friends and family of Emwazi had confirmed he was the ISIS frontman. The revelation was swiftly picked up by the British media, but despite being broadcast around the world, British authorities continue to remain tight-lipped. Scroll down for video . The UK Government remains tight-lipped over the naming of Jihadi John, who was revealed today to be 26-year-old Mohammed Emwazi, from Queen's Park in west London. Police attended his home today (pictured) Raffaello Pantucci, a senior research fellow at defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute, said it was no surprise that Jihadi John's outing was revealed by America. He said: 'It will elevate him, and even add to the mythology around him in some minds. 'He has been on the radar for a long time now, and we finally know who he is. 'There is a reason the British security services would not have wanted his name to be made public, because they will have been watching his associates covertly as part of their intelligence gathering. 'The FBI said last year they knew who Jihadi John was, but my understanding is he had actually been narrowed down to one of three people, and the British and Americans were not sure which. 'That is an example of the different attitude when it comes to revealing information.' Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers. Both UK and U.S authorities have maintained that they have been running a joint investigation to unmask the ISIS militant. However, while the British Government has largely remained tight-lipped about the probe, U.S. officials have been more vocal. The U.S. Senate has also previously offered a £6million reward to anyone providing information that could lead to the capture of Jihadi John. Last September, U.S. sources revealed that American spy planes had flown above Britain to monitor telephone and computer signals in a bid to track down the British terrorist and those communicating with him. The aircraft, manned by British pilots and carrying FBI agents, were equipped with advanced technology to detect heat coming off a keyboard when a button was pressed. At the time, the U.S. claimed that Jihadi John was from a suburb within 10 miles of south London, but Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said  that UK officials were only 'getting warm' as to confirming his identity. However, in the same month - perhaps reinstating the fact it was a joint investigation between the two countries - it emerged that family members of Jihadi John had been interviewed by both Met officers and an FBI agent.","British authorities remain tight-lipped about identity of Jihadi John .

"Two men from Adelaide have performed an amazing road-site emergency Cesarean section to save a tiny baby wombat from the pouch of it's dead mother. Friends Dmrenzo Kotze, 21, and Chris Dimasi, 20, of Craigmore, in South Australia, discovered the deceased wombat in the middle of the road as they were driving through the Riverland region of Blanchetown on Saturday. The pair noticed small movements near the stomach of the wombat when they went to move it off the driving track, and quickly located a knife to rescue the small creature they believed to be inside. Scroll down for video . Dmrenzo Kotze and Chris Dimasi, from Adelaide, performed an emergency c-section to rescue a baby wombat . The baby only weighed 247 grams and was believed to be three months old . 'We could kind of see something moving inside ... we thought we could see what we could do because (we thought) it could be a baby,' Mr Kotze told Perth Now. Mr Dimasi, who works in an abattoir, began to cut open the stomach of the wombat while Mr Kotze filmed the extraordinary procedure. The footage shows the outer layer of fur and skin being cut away by Mr Dimasi, who uses a series of clean cuts to carefully open the wombat until they can see the joey inside. After piercing the pouch, the baby wombat slides out onto the dirt and rolls around before being helped to its feet by Mr Dimasi. 'We wrapped it up and took it to my house and gave it a wash to try and get as much dirt and everything off it,' said Mr Kotze. Mr Dimasi, who works in an abattoir, began to cut open the stomach of the wombat . The outer layer of fur and skin was cut away by Mr Dimasi, who uses a series of clean cuts to carefully open the wombat until they can see the joey inside . The young men took the tiny wombat, who weighs just 247 grams, to local members of Fauna South Australia, Jane and Phil Budich, of Blanchetown. Ms Budich said that baby wombats generally weigh about three kilograms when they are birthed from the pouch, and so the little creature will need to put on a significant amount of weight before it can be released into the wild. Ms Budich will be caring for wombat until that time, bottle feeding it every four hours and keeping it under a heat pad. The baby wombat has been named Whisper by Ms Budich, although Mr Kotze and Mr Dimasi said they had named him Jeffrey. Ms Budich has been caring for animals around South Australia for 15 years and has confirmed that the joey is a little boy. After piercing the pouch, the baby wombat slides out onto the dirt . The baby wombat, who the young men named Jeffrey, rolls around before being helped to its feet . Jane Burdich, a member of Fauna SA, will look after the baby wombat until it is old enough to be released . Ms Budich commended the pair for their quick thinking and said that Whisper would have been dead within a day if they had not rescued it. 'He's doing well, he's drinking bottles and has a beautiful little personality,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Wombats are battlers but you have to treat them with love. He's so tiny, he's the size of a pork sausage.' Ms Budich is a representative for Fauna SA, which has animal carers all around the state. 'If anyone comes across a baby wombat or kangaroo that has been stunned or injured they can call a fauna rescue service. Don't take the baby out of the pouch because they hold onto the mothers teat and their jaws can break for life,' Ms Budich said. 'The boys didn't know what they were doing but they did a good job. Fauna in Australia are so neglected so it's nice seeing people looking after animals,' she said. 'I would like to say Chris and myself are now proud fathers of 3 month old wombat Jeffery,' Mr Kotze posted on his Facebook page. He implored people to move animals off the road they are hit, and to make sure they are not suffering.","Dmrenzo Kotze and Chris Dimasi rescued an unborn baby wombat .

"Figures showing David Cameron has spectacularly failed to meet his promise to cut immigration will today be ‘buried’ under a slew of reports about the Jimmy Savile scandal. Ministers were last night accused of ‘cynically’ timing the release of the Savile investigations by two government departments to coincide with the migration statistics. Both will be released at 9.30am – with reports into the Savile’s paedophile abuse in at least 12 NHS hospitals and 21 children’s homes and schools certain to get blanket coverage. Immigration figures scheduled for release tomorrow are expected to show that net migration has risen again to more than 260,000, despite the coalition pledging to cut it to 'tens of thousands' The publication of the 16 reports from locations around the country will be accompanied by a live press conference. The migration statistics will be released without fanfare or a press conference by the independent Office for National Statistics. They are expected to show that net migration has risen again, to more than 260,000. The date has been fixed for months, with spin doctors acutely aware the figures could deliver a serious blow to the Prime Minister’s credibility. The government is also expected to release 16 reports into Jimmy Savile. The papers have been ready for months and are already overdue . The Savile reports could have been released at any time and are already overdue. Whitehall officials and MPs are convinced the date has been chosen deliberately. One said: ‘It is an open secret that’s what is going on.’ Unlike the immigration figures, no blame for the Savile affair can be laid at the Coalition’s door. Last night Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: ‘Thursday, it is clear, is, for this Government, a good day to bury bad news. ‘By burying the latest immigration figures under the Savile news, they know that the statistics will be masked. One just has to wonder what else will be released across Whitehall tomorrow?’ Mr Cameron made reducing net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ a key 2010 election promise. Yet, despite some initial progress, it had reached 260,000 in the year to June 2014. Experts believe today’s figures could be even worse – and will leave the Tories fighting the election with net migration higher than the 244,000 figure inherited from Labour. Last week, the separate Labour Force Survey showed migrant workers were continuing to pour into the UK in huge numbers. Over 12 months, the number of Eastern Europeans rose by almost 200,000. On Tuesday, David Cameron appeared to prepare the ground for a humiliating failure. He admitted he should cut benefits and tax credits for immigrants more quickly to stop Britain being such a ‘massive draw’.","Figures expected to show another rise in net migration to 260,000 .

"A U.S. company today infuriated Liverpool football fans by replacing the Hillsborough memorial flames in the club crest with iced coffee cups as part of a Twitter campaign. Dunkin' Donuts asked supporters to suggest redesigns for the badge, and presented its own version last night - which featured the cups in place of the red flames either side of the crest. The Massachusetts-based firm, which has since apologised for 'any insensitivity', later took down the tweet and ended the campaign - but not before its 'ignorance' was criticised by fans of the club. Campaign: Dunkin' Donuts asked supporters on Twitter to suggest redesigns for the badge, and presented its own version last night - which featured the cups in place of the red flames either side of the crest . Remember: The eternal flame represented in the crest burns at the centre of the Hillsborough memorial at the club's Anfield Stadium . Its version of the badge also used doughnuts and a coffee cup to replace the Shankly Gates that represent late manager Bill Shankly - and the 'established' year was switched from 1892 to 1950. The company also replaced the Liver bird - which is taken from the city's coat of arms, and has been the central feature of the club's badge for more than 110 years - with the Dunkin' Donuts logo. Liverpool fan Michael Evans said on Twitter: 'You don't mess with the eternal flame on the club's crest. If you don't get that, you've no business being anywhere near LFC, Dunkin' Donuts.' Another fan calling himself 'Stevelfc1' tweeted: 'I can appreciate the light hearted intention of the Dunkin' Donuts badge thing but to replace the flames with milkshakes shows pure ignorance.' And Jim Boardman, who writes about the club for various publications, said: 'As a company, with guidance from LFC, they should have been aware and staff on that campaign briefed.' Anger: The Massachusetts-based firm's 'ignorance' was criticised by fans of the Premier League club . Unimpressed: Liverpool fan Michael Evans said nobody should 'mess with the eternal flame' on the crest . Who was behind it? This Twitter user questioned if an official at Liverpool may have approved the campaign . Change: In 2012 the badge on the shirts was replaced with the stand-alone Liver bird on a new kit designed by U.S. company Warrior (pictured, being worn by Daniel Sturridge, Jordan Henderson and Mario Balotelli) Liverpool announced a multi-million-pound partnership with Dunkin' Donuts in January 2014 that saw it become the 'official coffee, tea and bakery provider' for the Premier League team. The company also works with US baseball teams Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, New York Mets and Tampa Bay Rays, and American football outfits Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots. Fourteen in Britain: Dunkin Donuts has more than 10,500 restaurants in 31 countries around the world . A spokesman for Dunkin' Donuts said: 'We apologise for any insensitivity regarding our tweet supporting an LFC-themed promotion featuring the LFC crest. 'As a proud partner of LFC, we did not intend any offence, particularly to the club's supporters. We have removed the tweet and halted the campaign immediately.' Dunkin Donuts has more than 10,500 restaurants in 31 countries around the world - including 14 in Britain, all in the South East. In 2013 it announced plans to develop 150 restaurants in the UK. The Hillsborough disaster saw 96 Liverpool supporters die at the FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in April 1989 at Sheffield Wednesday. A series of inquests into the deaths was launched in March 2014 in Warrington, Cheshire, after the High Court quashed verdicts in the original hearings. These are still ongoing. The version of the badge featured in the Dunkin' Donuts campaign appeared on the club's shirts between 1992 and 2012 - but is still used on the club's website. In 2012 the badge on the shirts was replaced with the stand-alone Liver bird on a new kit designed by American company Warrior. It prompted an angry response from families of those killed at Hillsborough because it dropped the flames - but this new crest is still used today. A Liverpool spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment today from MailOnline.","Dunkin' Donuts asked supporters to suggest redesigns for team's badge .

"A TV flower expert and his boyfriend were wrongly mistaken for terrorists and quizzed by police as they sat eating quiche and chips at a seafront cafe. Jonathan Moseley, who appears on BBC 2's The Big Allotment Challenge, was baffled when officers approached him outside  Terrace Cafe in Redcar, north Yorkshire. The florist and his partner Bish Sharif were accused of approaching staff in a nearby New Look and told they could face terrorism offences before police realised they had reached the wrong people. Jonathan Moseley and his partner Bish Sharif (above) were approached by Cleveland Police officers and warned they could face terrorism offences as they ate lunch in a seafront cafe . Mr Moseley said he would be making a formal complaint after being left 'shaken up' by the experience. He and his partner were enjoying lunch when two Cleveland Police officers walked in to the cafe and demanded to speak to them outside. 'A police van pulled up outside, then a policeman and woman entered the cafe and walked towards our table,' Mr Molesley said. 'They asked me and my partner to step outside because they needed to talk to us about an incident. 'When I said ""what?"" they said we needed to step outside - that it would be less embarrassing for us if we didn't. 'They said we’d been seen on CCTV in New Look approaching staff and telling them not to worry, that we were military police and monitoring a possible terrorist incident happening in Redcar. 'It was totally bizarre - we hadn’t even been in New Look....but they were adamant CCTV footage confirmed it was us.' After asking whether he could see the offending footage Mr Molesley claims he was curtly told he could face terrorism charges. The pair were told to leave the cafe and answer police officers' questions outside or 'they would be embarrassed' Mr Moseley now plans to take action against the force for the incident. Cleveland Police has apologised since . 'Apparently the reason we were linked to it was we fitted the description of wearing boots and dark jackets. But even though I knew we’d done nothing wrong, I was starting to get really panicky - it looked like we might get arrested for a potentially serious offence we had absolutely no knowledge of. 'But eventually, they told us it might be a case of mistaken identity and we were free to go.' After leaving the seaside town the television personality said he was planning on taking further action against the force. 'Redcar police need to be held accountable for this. It’s just such a negative thing to happen to people coming to Redcar as tourists, hoping to enjoy a nice day out. 'We certainly don’t feel like rushing to come back.' A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said: 'We would like to apologise to these two gentlemen for any disruption to their afternoon caused by some confusion with descriptions. 'Two other gentlemen were spoken to and all parties were given advice.' The men were accused of approaching staff in a nearby New Look (above).

"The president of Eastern Kentucky University worked his way into the hearts of students last week, when he accepted a senior's challenge to shovel his driveway. Devan Dannelly was just one of several EKU students complaining on Twitter about having to battle snow to get to class on February 17. But the senior called out EKU's President Michael Benson specifically that afternoon, catching the administrator's attention. 'Yo @EKUPrez come shovel my driveway/road and I'll come to class tomorrow...deal?' Dannelly tweeted. A gentleman and a scholar: Eastern Kentucky University President Michael Benson accepted a student's request to shovel his driveway last week when snow hit campus . Benson says he out in his own driveway when he got the Twitter notification on his phone. 'I see this tweet, and I go in to my wife, and I said, ""I’m going to surprise a student. I just want to see the look on his face when I show up to shovel his driveway,""' Benson told the Deseret News. Within seven minutes, Benson fired off another tweet accepting the challenge and asking where Dannelly lives, and within an hour arrived at the home armed with a shovel and a friend to help. Dannelly, who lives near campus with his family, was out at the time but his mother answered the door and let the men get to work. Altogether it took them about 45 minutes to clear the driveway. Joker: Senior Devan Dannelly was one of several EKU students complaining about the weather and the fact that classes hadn't been cancelled . On his way! Within seven minutes of tweeting his challenge, EKU's president responded asking for Dannelly's address . Hard work: Less than an hour later, Benson and a friend showed up at Dannelly's family home while he was out, and started working. He also posed with Dannelly's mom Kandra, seen above . Appreciative: When Dannelly later showed up at the house, he invited his university's president to dinner and they posed for this picture inside last week . When Dannelly arrived later, he was so moved by the kind gesture that he invited Benson and his friend  to dinner. After the dinner, Dannelly again took to Twitter, this time with nothing but nice things to say about Benson. 'Guys, [Benson] is a top class guy and I can not think of a better person to be our president,' Dannelly wrote. 'The man is a hard worker too! I'm looking forward to class tomorrow!' 'I will literally never complain about going to class again.' He also volunteered to help anyone else clear their driveway. And while the university closed the next two days after Benson came by to shovel, Dannelly followed through on his promise to go to class - snapping a picture of himself at the abandoned school the next day. A deal is a deal: Classes were cancelled the next two days after Benson shoveled Dannelly's driveway, but the student kept up on his end of the deal . Moved: Dannelly posted this picture to Twitter, inside an abandoned classroom, since he promised to go to school on Wednesday . 'No class this week but I held up my end of the deal anyways,' Dannelly wrote. In an interview with Today.com, Dannelly said he is still shocked that Benson would go out of his way to respond to his tweet. 'It is rare that an average student like myself gets to have any kind of interaction with their campus president, so I feel honored really. He is really a top-class guy, and I think we both have become semi-famous overnight from all of this,' Dannelly said. Benson told the Deseret News that he had no idea the story would make national headlines, but said he's glad it's helped inspire his students to 'help others and pitch in'. Benson and his family moved to Kentucky just a year ago so he could become the new president of EKU. He says the public relations team at the school encouraged him to join Twitter and that he's seen the social media platform help him make a connection to students. 'It was fun, and I got to make a connection with a student that otherwise probably wouldn’t have happened,' he told the Richmond Register.","Eastern Kentucky University senior Devan Dannelly tweeted school's president last week: 'Shovel my road and I'll come to class tomorrow'

"Most tourists visiting the capital will call in at Big Ben and visit Buckingham Palace, but very few will venture beyond to some of the secret - but equally beautiful - sights in London. However, one photographer has dedicated four years of his life to tracking down some of the most unusual and overlooked attractions in the city, taking beautiful photos to celebrate their history. From corridors of power to shrines of religion and music, photographer Peter Dazeley has caught them all on camera for a book entitled 'Unseen London'. Scroll down for video . The Crossness Pumping Station, in Bexley was designed as part of the sewer works created by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and opened in 1865. Following vandalism after it became defunct in the 1950s, but volunteers have helped restore its beautiful Victorian heritage . Designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and Matthew Digby Wyatt, the Foreign Office in Durbar Court, SW1, was first used in 1867 when it was the India Office building . Freemasons’ Hall, built between 1927 and 1932 in Great Queen Street, is the headquarters of the United Grand Lodge of England and the principal meeting place for Masonic Lodges in London, and right, the Lloyds General Committee Room in the Collcutt building at 71 Fenchurch Street, the highlight of Thomas Edward Colcutt's architectural genius . The Freemasons Grand Temple has an elaborate match of tradition and modern fare. The building is fully open to the public and free tours are available most week days . Londoner Peter, 66,compiled his labour of love after first being inspired by a view from his own apartment across the Thames from Battersea Power Station. He said: 'I'm a Londoner myself and my apartment between the Chelsea and Vauxhall Bridges overlooked the Battersea Power Station. 'Over the years I saw it's transformation and when I was first allowed in there to photograph it was incredible. 'It was the change of this building that inspired me to think what other great parts of London nobody had seen or knew about. 'The city is constantly evolving and some of these buildings will be lost without someone ever seeing them. Abbey Road Studios' Studio One in St John's Wood has an extensive range of classic and modern outboard equipment; any operator of this would certainly have to know what they are doing however . Abbey Road Studios were made famous by The Beatles, who recorded an album of the same name, which of course, featured the group walking over the pedestrian crossing outside the venue . Studio One is the largest purpose-built recording studio and can comfortably house a 110-piece orchestra . 'Now Battersea is set to hold three hotels, 3,990 apartments, 250 shops and restaurants with a studio going for £950,000.' In his stunning pictures some unlikely locations prove themselves real hidden gems - like the incredible interior of the 1859 Crossness Pumping Station, in Bexley. Peter said: 'The irony is that this pumping station was designed as part of the sewer works created by Sir Joseph Bazalgette to take the waste out of London. But his ancestor went on to produce TV's Big Brother, in my opinion bringing it back in. Abbey Road Studios has become a favourite tourist attraction, with fans keen to leave their own personal mark there, and right,  the BT Tower imposes from near and far . This motor provides the power for the BT Tower's revolving floor, that has once housed a restaurant. Nowadays the venue is reserved for specially-organised trips . Lancashire Boilers used coal to power two pumping engines that pumped water from a reservoir under the floor into the hydraulic system that helped open Tower Bridge up for ships to pass . While Tower Bridge is recognisable from the front, if you were shown this photo you might not know you were in the bascule chamber underneath one of London's famous landmarks . 'The interior of Midland Bank was interesting, it goes back to a time when people respected their bank manager. It includes bespoke furniture including a cupboard for the management's top hats and a drawer below for their canes. 'And people don't realise Abbey Studios which I photographed is big enough to hold a symphony orchestra, for film scores, and they still record in analogue. 'The BT Tower is open to access and what fascinated me was the tiny lawnmower sized engine responsible for revolving the top floor of the Tower. St Sophia's Greek Orthodox Cathedral on Moscow Road, Bayswater, was built in 1879 by the Greek community in London. It is built in the form of a cruciform basilica with a central dome . Battersea Power Station is a decommissioned coal-fired power station located on the south bank of the River Thames. The development of flats and houses could see the area become more like a village in a city . 'A lot of the buildings in the book you can get in to see but it's not easy and you can perhaps only have five minutes in them.'For example I've walked past the Mason's building in Convent Garden thousands of times and had no idea of the hidden gem inside.

There is some evidence of a school being on the site as far back as 1243, but the one we know today is believed to have dated back to 1572 . Winston Churchill and Stanley Baldwin are some of the most famous alumni of Harrow School; more recent old scholars include actor Benedict Cumberbatch and and current England rugby international Billy Vunipola . The squash courts at Harrow school, where the yearly fees are almost £36,000 for education and boarding . The Midland Bank board room is found close to the Guildhall and Bank of England in the City.

"A coalition of Sydney artists have launched a campaign against a 'hopeless' Tony Abbott, by remixing an iconic political poster. The 4.5m tall billboard has been posted in Sydney's CBD, and is a re-imagining of the  'Hope' image that became famous during Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. However, as much as Shepard Fairey's iconic image helped usher a leader to power, Mr Agzarian's version hopes to show another leader the door. Mr Agzarian told the Sydney Morning Herald he has become fed up with the current government, and labelled it as 'inept and uncaring'. 'This is a government that is leaving a lot of people behind,' Mr Agzarian said. Scroll down for video . A poster designed by Michael Agzarian and the group 'Abbottsolutely' not, is placed on a billboard in Sydney. The poster sums up public sentiment towards the Prime Minister, with just 25 per cent voters satisfied by his performance, according to Newspoll figures released this week. Further, 77 per cent view Mr Abbott as 'arrogant', and the government continues to be behind Labor in two-party preferred polling figures. The poster sums up public sentiment towards the Prime Minister, with just 25 per cent voters satisfied by his performance, according to Newspoll figures released this week. A recent spill motion also sent shockwaves through the Prime Minister's leadership, with one third of his party room voting to boot him from office. Mr Agzarian said the current climate and contrast between Mr Abbbott and Mr Obama motivated him to put his own spin on the famous 'Hope' image. 'Obama gave people hope, whereas Abbott just makes us feel hopeless - and is pretty hopeless himself,' Mr Agzarian said. The group plans to post more billboards across Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, in addition to 'hundreds of single sheet 700 x 1000 mm street posters' that will distributed across the Sydney CBD, and in the Prime Minister's electorate of Warringah. 'We want more posters up around Sydney and across other major cities,' the group's website reads. Additional billboards will cost anywhere between $3500 and $35,190. Mr Agzarian and his group have asked for public donations to ensure the posters are plastered across the country, and is accepting donations at its website, www.abbottsolutelynot.com. Street posters can also be purchased for $629 for 100, or $799 for 250. Shepard Fairey's iconic image of Barack Obama, which served as the motivated for Mr Agzarian's poster. 'Obama gave people hope, whereas Abbott just makes us feel hopeless - and is pretty hopeless himself,' Mr Agzarian said. The original 'Hope' poster was a central piece of Mr Obama's successful 2008 campaign, and has inspired a variety of other spin-offs in the years since its release. The first hand-finished copy of the poster was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery in 2009.

"Former soldier Richard Monteith was upset after being told to turn down the collar of his shirt because the Union Jack design was 'offensive . A former soldier who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan claims he was turned away from a pub in Scotland because workers said the union flag on his top was offensive. Richard Monteith was told he would not be served again in the Black Bull pub in Polmont, Falkirk, unless he turned down the collar of his Hackett Boat Race polo shirt, which exposed a Union Jack , because it was seen as offensive. The 36-year-old served 17 years with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and lost several friends and colleagues during tours of the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Kosovo. He said he was upset with the reaction because he had been in the army and had to deal with seeing a lot of friends draped in the flag after dying in service. The incident took place last Friday. Mr Monteith said: 'I had a couple of sips of my pint and was told unless I turned my collar down I wouldn't be served again. 'I asked why and they said the Union Jack and red, white and blue colours were offensive. 'When I asked why the woman just laughed and said 'because it is'. 'I just don't see how the flag or even the colours could be so offensive to anybody. 'To say red, white and blue are offensive is laughable. It was really silly comments, to be honest.' Mr Monteith, now a security consultant, added: 'Being in the army I have carried quite a few friends that are draped in these colours so I find it very offensive.

"The American doctor who carried the Ebola virus from Guinea to New York, riding the subway and going bowling before symptoms developed, said the public was never properly educated about the disease. Dr Craig Spencer, an emergency room physician, penned an article for Wednesday's New England Journal of Medicine that blamed politicians and media outlets for fanning fears. 'When we look back on this epidemic, I hope we'll recognize that fear caused our initial hesitance to respond - and caused us to respond poorly when we finally did,' Spencer wrote. Slammed: Dr Craig Spencer penned an article for the New England Journal of Medicine attacking the media and politicians for alarmist reports and attempts to use the Ebola outbreak for political gain . The emergency room physician treated patients in Guinea with the Doctors without Borders, before returning to the United States last October. He developed symptoms consistent with those of Ebola and was diagnosed on October 23, just days after arriving in the United States. Media reports about Spencer's diagnosis, the first in New York, focused on how he rode the subway, went out to eat and even went bowling between his return and the diagnosis. Little attention, Spencer argued, was spent on how the disease is known to be transmitted, and that research points to it being 'nearly impossible for me to have transmitted the virus before I had a fever.' Spencer also bemoaned how he was described as a 'a fraud, a hipster and a hero' at the same time by news reports. 'The truth is, I am none of those things,' he said. 'I’m just someone who answered a call for help and was lucky enough to survive.' Responding: Spencer traveled to Guinea in order to treat Ebola patients, returning in October and being diagnosed shortly after his arrival in the US . Engaged: Spencer's fiancee, Morgan Dixon, was admitted to the hospital after Spencer's diagnosis but was soon released . 'Meanwhile, politicians, caught up in the election season, took advantage of the panic to try to appear presidential instead of supporting a sound, science-based public health response,' he added. Following Spencer's diagnosis, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie announced 21-day quarantines for those arriving in either state after working with Ebola patients. Each governor painted federal health guidelines as inadequate during their announcements, but Spencer called such talk counter productive. They 'enacted strict home quarantine rules without sufficiently considering the unintended side effects,' namely encouraging those exposed to lie out of fear of quarantine. The sick, according to Spencer, would opt not to seek treatment while caregivers working with Ebola patients would 'alter their travel plans or misreport their exposure to avoid quarantine.' Another voice criticizing politicians' reactions to the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, which had caused the deaths of 3,416 in Sierra Leone as well as hitting Liberia and Guinea, was nurse Kaci Hickox. In an op-ed in the Guardian, Hickox explained her frustration over being labeled the 'Ebola nurse' by Gov Christie in spite of her never having symptoms of the virus. 'This is what did happen: I was quarantined against my will by overzealous politicians after I volunteered to go and treat people affected by Ebola in west Africa,' she wrote. 'Christie and my governor in Maine, Paul LePage, decided to disregard medical science and the constitution in hopes of advancing their careers,' she added. Spencer was released on November 11 having cleared the virus with the help of a blood plasma transfusion from an Ebola survivor. 'We all lose when we allow irrational fear, fueled in part by prime-time ratings and political expediency, to supersede pragmatic public health preparedness,' Spencer wrote.","Dr Craig Spencer wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine calling out the governors who imposed a quarantine after his diagnosis .

I grabbed him from behind under his arms but a wave came and pushed us against another pile. ‘We both went under the water and at that point I lost him.’ On coming back up to the surface Mr Constable looked around but there was no sign of the man. ‘I searched around for about five minutes, then went back to the ladder,’ he said.

"Attorneys for the 19-year-old 'gang member' accused of killing a mother in a spray of gunfire want a judge to let them check the dead woman's body for gunshot residue. Erich Milton Nowsch Jr. stood shackled in court Thursday while lawyers Augustus Claus and Conrad Claus told a judge they want police, dispatch and coroner records ahead of a scheduled March 10 hearing. The lawyers also asked for an order for a coroner's office to allow a test on Tammy Meyers' body to determine if she or someone next to her fired a gun before she died. Scroll down for video . Erich Nowsch Jr. (pictured in a Las Vegas courtroom on Monday) has been charged with the murder of Tammy Meyers. His attorney wants the victim's body to be tested for gunshot revenue . Nowsch is jailed without bail on murder, attempted murder and weapon charges. The 44-year-old Meyers was wounded in the head February 12 and died two days later. Nowsch was arrested on February. 19. Many questions remain after conflicting accounts from authorities and Meyers' family about what initially was characterized as a road rage attack. The 19-year-old's defense team hope the request to the coroner's office will be able to determine whether Meyers, 44, or somebody next to her fired a gun before she died . On Tuesday, his lawyers said he was high on marijuana while he was being questioned, and cops knew it. He surrendered to the authorities after a stand-off in suburban Las Vegas. Claus said he plans to argue in court that anything Nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial. It's not clear what Nowsch told detectives after his arrest. 'People tend to say things that aren't entirely credible when they're under the influence,' he told the Associated Press. Claus said 'not only' did the police let Nowsch smoke, they 'watched him do it' as they tried 'to talk him down' during a standoff that involved a helicopter and a SWAT team. The allegation was just the latest in a string of turns that has plagued what was initially thought to be a 'road rage' murder. On Monday, local resident Robert Selig said Meyers, 44, was killed in a 'drug deal gone bad'. 'The son and mother left the Meyers residence looking for Eric on a drug deal gone bad,' he said. 'That's the word on the street. A prescription drug deal gone bad.' Selig said he believes Meyers went to the park to pick up pharmaceutical pills 'like Xanax' from Erich. 'The kid sold it right there at that concrete table, day in day out,' he said. Nowsch has been accused of shooting 44-year-old Tammy Meyers dead during an act of road rage. It has since been revealed that the Meyers family knew the suspect . The Meyers family initially claimed that Meyers had gotten into an argument with Nowsch while giving her daughter a driving lesson on the night of the February 12 shooting. They said Nowsch followed them home and shot at them. It has since emerged that Meyers went home and recruited her son Brandon, who brought his . Meyers was shot in the head and died after two days on life-support. Claus said he believes Nowsch will be able to claim self-defense because Brandon Meyers was armed.

"Getting your dog spayed or neutered is accepted as being part of a responsible pet owner. But two studies suggest that the  surgical procedure could increase the long-term risk of certain cancers in canines. A  study conducted in 2013 found a link between neutering in Golden Retrievers and incidences of cancers including osteosarcoma, mast cell cancer and hemangiosarcoma. Two studies suggest that spaying or neutering pets could increase the long-term risk of certain cancers .A study conducted in 2013 found a link between the practice in Golden Retrievers (stock image pictured) and incidences of osteosarcoma - a rare bone cancer - mast cell cancer and hemangiosarcoma . Researchers from the University of California-Davis studied hospital records of 759 dogs between the age of one and eight years old. They found that three times as many early neutered males were diagnosed with lymphosarcoma – the third most common cancer in dogs – as unneutered males. And the percentage of late-neutered females, at eight per cent, was four times more than intact and early-neutered females. Another study, published in 2014, focused on connections seen in the Vizsla breed and was based on a voluntary internet study for 2,505 dogs born between 1992 and 2008, Scientific American reported. Scientists from Binghampton University, State University of New York, found correlations between spayed and neutered Vizlas and mast cell cancer, lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma. A stock image of lymphoma in human blood is pictured . Scientists from Binghampton University, State University of New York, found correlations between spayed and neutered Vizlas and mast cell cancer, lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma - cancer of blood vessel lining. Neutered Vizslas (stock image) were also found to be more likely to develop behaviour disorders . Dogs that had undergone the procedure were also more likely to have behaviour disorders, such as storm anxiety and the younger they were spayed or neutered, the earlier these problems may show, according to the study, which was published in the American Veterinary Medical Association's journal. However the researchers said that more research is needed to confirm their findings. Commenting on the study in a blog post, Dr Stephen Birchard, of Circle City Veterinary Speciality Hospital, in Indianapolis, Indiana, wrote: 'Of course the benefits of spay and neuter, such as controlling dog and cat populations and the many other medical benefits currently outweigh the adverse effects. ‘But this study shows that we need to maintain a healthy level of surveillance of the potential adverse effects of gonadectomy and attempt to determine: is this association between cancer and spay/neuter true for all breeds, even mixed breeds, and what is the pathophysiology behind it.’ Phil Robinson, Veterinary Surgeon at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, told MailOnline: 'Our main reason for neutering is to prevent the dogs from being used for breeding. One medical benefit of neutering is the prevention of prolonged seasons leading to potential womb infection in older age. 'There are lots of reasons to support neutering, but it’s impossible to say for sure whether neutering or not neutering your dog causes cancer. While the results of the two studies may sound bleak, Jessica Perry Hekman, a PhD student at the University of Illinois, noted that the Golden Retrievers studied in the 2013 paper were referred to an expensive, specialist hospital, so it does not take into account animals that have not been given the very best care from their owners. She said the research is biased in its selection. Neutering is the removal of all or part of an animal's reproductive organs. Vets and animals charities recommend the procedure to prevent the births of unwanted litters of puppies and cats. Behaviours such as mounting and urine spraying, as well as some forms of male aggression, can be stopped because of the reduction in hormone levels in neutered animals. There is weak evidence that spaying reduces the risk of mammary tumours in female dogs. The risk of ovarian cancer and testicular cancer is removed, because the animals no longer have these organs. However, animals are at risk of complications from the procedure itself. Spaying and neutering cats may boost the risk of obesity, because a decrease in sex hormone levels is associated with an increase in food intake. Researchers claim that neutered dogs are at a two-fold excess risk to develop osteosarcoma (bone cancer) as compared to intact dogs. Studies of cardiac tumours in dogs showed that there was a 5 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma - cancer of blood vessel lining - in spayed females than intact females and a 2.4 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma in neutered dogs as compared to intact males. The 2014 paper may be flawed in the same way, she explained, because although data was collected online, the survey was probably filled in by diligent dog owners who had seen it on canine-focused online communities. Owners also filled in their dog’s medical history, so it may not be accurate. ‘The studies both have their limitations, which makes their findings difficult to trust or generalise to other populations of dogs,’ she said. Another 2013 study by the University of Georgia, based on data from a number of referral hospitals, found that spayed and neutered Golden Retrievers,  lived longer on average than those with their reproductive organs kept intact. They found that dogs with their genitals intact were more likely to die of trauma or infectious diseases, while those that had been neutered were more susceptible to cancer or immune-mediated diseases. The experts concluded that while spayed and neutered dogs were more likely to get cancer, it didn’t automatically shorten their lifespans. The study suggests that animals that had had the procedure lived long enough to get cancer, while those that did not, were more likely to die younger without reaching the time in life where the risk of cancer rises.","Two studies hint spayed or neutered pets are at higher risk of cancers .

"Veteran CBS correspondent Bob Simon has left $2million to his widow Francoise following his death in a horrific New York car crash. Francoise Anne-Marie Simon reportedly will inherit $1million in cash and stocks along with a $1milion home in East Hampton, Long Island. Simon, 73, who spent decades as a foreign correspondent, was still working for CBS' 60 Minutes at the time of his death on February 11. Simon was killed when a town car he was traveling in collided with bollards on the West Side Highway in Manhattan. Scroll down for video . Estate: Francoise Anne-Marie Simon stands to inherit $2 million from her late husband, CBS reporter Bob Simon. The couple are seen together in this 2009 photo . Accident: Simon was killed when a town car he was traveling in collided with bollards on the West Side Highway in Manhattan. Mangled wreckage from the February 11 accident is seen here . Family: Francoise Anne-Marie Simon holds hands with her daughter Tanya Simon in New York City on February 12, one day after losing her husband and CBS reporter Bob Simon . The New York Post, citing a correspondent's will, reported that Simon had a East Hampton home worth $1 million, as well as '$1 million in cash and stocks and bonds.' His estate is going to pay for his recent $38,000 funeral, the newspaper reported. The Post reported that upon his widow's death, Tanya Simon - the couple's daughter - stands to inherit everything. Francoise Anne-Marie Simon has requested to be named the estate's executor, according to the newspaper. The couple, who were married for 49 years, met during Bob Simon's time in France continuing his studies, the Post reported. On Sunday night, CBS paid tribute to Simon last night with a special hour-long episode which celebrated his life and career. Presented by Steve Kroft, the special '60 Minutes Presents' charted   Simon's 47-year career presenting from war zones and disasters across the world. On the show Simon was remembered for having traveled to more than 130 different countries to report on every possible type of news. 'It was his love of adventure and the search for new experiences that drove him to explore exotic and often dangerous places,' Kroft said on the program. Simon, who survived being held in an Iraqi prison under the regime of Saddam Hussein and was one of the last reporters to leave Saigon during the Vietnam War, died following the crash on Manhattan's West Side Highway. Kroft said: 'Tonight, we remember and celebrate the life and extraordinary career of our friend and colleague Bob Simon. 'He spent 47 years covering the world for CBS News and 60 Minutes and survived dozens of wars and other calamities. 'He died 11 days ago in a New York City traffic accident not far from this studio. 'The irony would not have been lost on Bob. Irony was one of his favorite journalistic devices. 'He was a brilliant combination of sophistication and street smarts, who liked to tell people he was just a Jewish kid from the Bronx. 'He didn't tell you that he was also Phi Beta Kappa, and had been a Fulbright scholar, or that he came to become television's quintessential foreign correspondent.' The show looked at three of Simon's most memorable stories: The Shame of Srebrenica, which looked at the slaughter by Serb troops of more than 8,000 Muslim civilians in that Bosnian town and the role of Dutch U.N Peacekeepers; The Sea Gypsies, about a small community who survived the 2004 Asian Tsunami; and The Recyclers, about a town built on a rubbish dump in Paraguay. Colleague Lesley Stahl said on the program: 'It wasn't an easy choice to pick only three, given the hundreds of stories he did, and the range of subjects he took on. 'He combined bravery, an eye for the telling detail and, at times, a righteous indignation at war's folly and its consequences.' Scott Pelley said during '60 Minutes Presents': 'Bob Simon was always ready for an adventure - a chance to travel somewhere he'd never seen and tell us all about it. 'He had a gift for finding the surprising, even the magical, in the most unexpected places.' Simon was born on May 29, 1941, in the Bronx, New York City, and graduated from Brandeis University in 1962, receiving a degree in history. He started his 47-year career with CBS News in 1967. Return: This 1991 file photo shows Simon after he was released from captivity. He was reportedly interrogated, beaten with canes and truncheons, and starved by his Iraqi captors . Two years later, Simon joined the network's foreign bureaus, where he was until 1981 when he became the State Department correspondent. He went on to report from war zones in Portugal, Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, the Persian Gulf, and Yugoslavia. He covered the conflict in Northern Ireland and U.S. military actions in Grenada, Somalia and Haiti. Simon was described by his 60 Minutes producer as a 'reporter's reporter' and his coverage and insight into some of the world's most hostile regions brought numerous accolades including 27 Emmys and four Peabody Awards. Simon joined CBS News as a reporter and assignment editor, covering campus unrest and inner-city riots. He also worked in CBS' Tel Aviv bureau from 1977 to 1981 and in Washington, D.C., as its Department of State correspondent. He got his start as a globe-trotting war correspondent in Vietnam. During one broadcast from the war zone, Simon reported from the back of a helicopter on its way to collect an American with shrapnel wounds. Family: Simon's daughter Tanya (pictured, left with her father, center, in October 2013) produced his final 60 Minutes piece. She is the only child of Bob Simon and his widow, Francoise Anne-Marie Simon . He covered the length of the Vietnam War. In 1987, he was made chief Middle East correspondent for CBS News. At the beginning of the Persian-Gulf war in January 1991, he was captured with colleagues by Iraqi forces. The team spent 40 days in a prison of Iraqi despot Saddam Hussein. He was interrogated, beaten with canes and truncheons, and starved by his Iraqi captors. Following his ordeal, he returned to Iraq in January 1993 to cover the U.S. bombing of the country. Simon won numerous awards, including his fourth Peabody and an Emmy for his story from Central Africa on the world's only all-black symphony in 2012. Another story about an orchestra in Paraguay, one whose poor members constructed their instruments from trash, won him his 27th Emmy, CBS said. He also won the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award, for 'Shame of Srebrenica,' a '60 Minutes II' report on genocide during the Bosnian War. His range was broad - from reporting on the Lost Boys of Sudan during the 1987 civil war to more recently, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster which was hit by a tsunami triggered by a 9.0 earthquake. 'It's a terrible loss for all of us at CBS News,' 60 Minutes Executive Producer Jeff Fager said in a memorial to Simon on CBS' website. 'It is such a tragedy made worse because we lost him in a car accident, a man who has escaped more difficult situations than almost any journalist in modern times.' 'Bob was a reporter's reporter. He was driven by a natural curiosity that took him all over the world covering every kind of story imaginable.' Bill Whitaker added during the 60 Minutes program: 'Bob Simon's great passion - apart from his family and good writing - was music. 'He delighted particularly in opera, but a symphony in Kinshasa, a young conductor in Caracas or a rap star from Brooklyn were all worthy of Bob's attention, and in his judgment, ours.' Simon’s final reporting piece for CBS was a collaboration between him and his daughter Tanya, who also works for the network. It was about Ebola and aired last Sunday.

"A baby who spent the first eight minutes of his life 'dead' has made a remarkable recovery. Theo Babbage's heart stopped beating as soon as he was born, leaving his distraught parents facing 'the longest eight minutes' of their lives. Doctors rushed to resuscitate him and reduce the chance of life-altering brain damage. To his parents' utter relief, they succeeded in bringing him back to life. Now five months old, Theo is a completely healthy baby. Theo Babbage's heart stopped beating as soon as he was born and doctors fought frantically for eight minutes to revive him. Now five months old, he is perfectly healthy and suffered no long-term damage . Theo's parents, Adam and Rachel, described the period when he was being revived as 'the longest eight minutes' of their lives . His mother, Rachel Cherry, 30, said:  'When you give birth, all you want to hear is your baby cry for the first time, but when Theo was born there was nothing. 'I kept waiting and waiting but there was no screaming or crying, and I knew something must be wrong. 'I stared around at the shocked looks on the medics' faces - I kept asking if my baby was OK but no one could answer. 'I thought my baby had died.' When she heard doctors counting down from five, she and Theo's father Adam, 29, knew their son was being resuscitated. 'Time passed so slowly. As a parent, it was unbearable being in the same room as my dying child,' she said. 'After eight minutes he was pale blue from being starved of oxygen for so long. 'So when we were told they had restarted his heart, a wave of relief swept over me and Adam - we just had to hope he'd be OK.' With the drama over, Theo was rushed away to  intensive care. 'Like any new mother, all I wanted to do was hold him in my arms and comfort him,' said Ms Cherry. 'Thankfully that's all behind us now. He's recovered and we're so eternally grateful to the hospital staff at the Norfolk and Norwich  Hospital. 'Without them our little baby boy wouldn't be alive today.' With the drama over, Theo was rushed away to intensive care. 'Like any new mother, all I wanted to do was hold him in my arms and comfort him,' said Ms Cherry . After a normal pregnancy, Ms Cherry's problems began in the delivery suite, when nurses explained Theo was stuck. Doctors had no other option but to perform an emergency Caesarean to free him. Following this, doctors then had to bring Theo back to life by clearing his lungs before they could restart his heart. It was uncertain whether he would suffer permanent brain damage or cerebral palsy from the oxygen deprivation. His mother said: 'We had no other option than to wait by his beside and hope he would be OK. 'He was having seizures on his first night and I thought he wouldn't make it. 'He was so fragile - even when I picked him up for the first time he still had tubes all over him, so I had to be very careful. 'It was frustrating not being able to bond with him , but noone knew what would happen from one day to the next and whether he'd pull through. 'When he cried for the first time after one week in intensive care it was such a relief.' It took 12 days before Theo could be discharged with his delighted parents and he quickly settled into life at home. Fragile Theo spent 12 days in intensive care - and it took him a week to cry for the first time. 'Even when I picked him up for the first time he still had tubes all over him, so I had to be very careful,' his mother said . Ms Cherry said: 'Now he's home we can finally bond with our baby and he's loving all the attention. 'He's absolutely gorgeous and constantly has us in fits of giggles, he's a very comical baby. 'I am so grateful to the doctors who saved our baby's life. 'It really could happen to anyone, but thankfully the right equipment was available to keep our baby alive, although not all hospitals have one.' The couple are now fundraising to buy another £10,000 specialist incubator - the same as the one that saved Theo's life - in the hope that it will help other families. Theo was cooled for his first four days to reduce the chance of any damage, which fortunately he didn't suffer. Ms Cherry and Mr Babbage hope that by acquiring another incubator, more babies will be as lucky as Theo.","Theo Babbage's heart stopped beating as soon as he was born .

"Saudi Arabia has beheaded an axe murderer and a heroin smuggler bringing the total number of public executions in the kingdom this year to 34. Indian man Vijay Kumar Saleem was convicted of killing a Yemeni national in an axe attack by striking him on the head. According to the Saudi interior ministry, the attack took place after a dispute at the farm where the men worked and Saleem was executed in the capital Riyadh. Police officers in Saudi Arabia who impose a strict version of Islamic Sharia law. Under the law, rape, murder, apostasy, drug trafficking and armed robbery are punishable by death . Meanwhile in the holy city of Medina, Pakistani national Hafiz Wifaq Rasoul Shah was also beheaded after being convicted of heroin trafficking. A separate interior ministry statement said: 'Investigations led to his confession and he was tried and found guilty.' According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Gulf has become an increasingly important market for illicit drugs in recent years. The Saudi government says it 'is committed to fighting drugs of all kinds due to the physical and social harm they cause'. The beheadings come just a day after a man was sentenced to death forposting a video on a social media site which shows him ripping up the Koran (file picture) It also says the death penalty in murder cases aims 'to maintain security and realise justice'. Drug trafficking, rape, murder, apostasy and armed robbery are all punishable by death under the Gulf kingdom's strict version of Islamic sharia law. The beheadings come just a day after a man was sentenced to death for renouncing his Muslim faith and posting a video on a social media site which shows him ripping up the Koran before hitting it with his shoe. A source who was in the General Court during his hearing said: 'In the video he cursed God, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his daughter Fatimah and ripped a copy of the Holy Qur'an and hit it with a shoe. 'The death sentence was issued after his apostasy was proven.' Amnesty International said in its annual report released on Wednesday that death sentences are often imposed 'after unfair trials'. The London-based watchdog said some defendants claimed to have been tortured or 'otherwise coerced or misled into making false confessions' before trial. It is believed that the kingdom executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013. The Saudi government has taken some steps to reform its judicial system but has also defended it as 'fair'. Last year a court in Jeddah sentenced Saudi liberal Raif Badawi to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for publishing criticism of the kingdom's ruling religious and political elite and calling for reforms in Islam. The first of 50 of those lashes were carried out in January, but subsequent rounds of flogging have not occurred. Officials have not publicly commented on the case, but insiders say the lashing appears to have been quietly dropped.","Two more public beheadings have been carried out in Saudi Arabia today .

"Convicted Australian terrorist, Khaled Sharrouf was involved in an underworld scuffle over $9 million alongside some of Sydney's most violent criminals before fleeing to Syria to fight with the outlawed extremist group, the Islamic State. Sharrouf, the father behind the circulation of an image of his son holding a severed head, is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for alleged terrorist activities in the Middle East after he fled the country in December on his brother's passport. He had been working alongside bikies, drug dealers and other crime figures as well as business identity George Alex before leaving the country, Fairfax has revealed. Scroll down for video .

Sharrouf posing with Mike Tyson: The convicted Australian terrorist had been part of a group collecting a $9 million debt for business identity George Alex before he left Australia . Sharrouf’s departure is suspected to have been prompted by the murder of debt collector Vasko Boskovski who he had been working with alongside Alex to retrieve an alleged $9 million debt from the property developer Meriton, according to a Fairfax investigation. Boskovski was killed after Sharrouf’s group butted-heads with another underworld group who claimed they were entitled to the $9 million, forcing both Sharrouf and Alex into hiding as they feared for their lives. Fairfax also revealed that Sharrouf first started associating with Alex after serving his jail sentence in 2005 at Goulburn and Lithgow prisons for his part in Operation Pendennis - a terrorist cell that operated in Melbourne and Sydney and was planning an Australian attack.

Alex and his counterparts were said to have secured a house for Sharif and his family after his release and in exchange, the jihadist ran errands for them which included collecting their debts. Since departing Australia, Sharrouf has been using his social media pages to boast about the Islamic State group.

It was accompanied by a photo of Sharrouf himself holding the same head, written with the words: 'What a head', and another of him and three young boys brandishing rifles. In 2005, psychiatrist Olav Nielssen - a renowned psychiatrist who sits on the NSW Mental Health Review Tribunal - assessed Sharrouf's condition and discovered the jihadist had depression, acute schizophrenia, paranoia and had suffered from hallucinations for a number of years, with signs of mental illness showing as early as the 1990s. A judge residing over Sharrouf's case had said his mental issues had driven him to jihad and pushed him towards extremism.","Sharrouf was a personality in Sydney's underworld and worked alongside business identity George Alex .

"SEX AND FILM . by Barry Forshaw . (Palgrave Macmillan £19.99) There was breathless excitement when an immensely raunchy, bestselling novel was adapted for the screen, with overwrought cinema-goers queuing in their droves to see it. But this was not Fifty Shades Of Grey. This was The Sheik, in 1921. And it starred Rudolph Valentino, whose sex appeal was such that when he died only five years later, aged just 31, some of his more committed female fans responded to the news by killing themselves. The history of sex on the big screen is about as old as the cinema itself. Barry Forshaw brings it wham, bam up to date, with analyses both of Fifty Shades and a much franker, darker exploration of sexual deviancy, Lars von Trier’s alarming 2013 film Nymphomaniac. But for me, the real gems in this formidably well-researched and erudite book concern the earlier manifestations of sex on-screen. Or off-screen, in the case of The Sheik, in which a wryly unambiguous caption, ‘After a week of sullen obedience . . . ’, told audiences that Valentino’s desert predator had finally had his wicked way with the headstrong Lady Diana. Like Fifty Shades, the book itself was rather less coy. The depiction of sex in the cinema has changed hugely over the years, the American film industry was notoriously cautious about what was shown - Jane Russell pictured in a poster for The Outlaw . By the Thirties, coyness was being forced onto Hollywood by increasingly vigilant censors, the so-called Hays Office. The African jungle was deemed far enough from ‘civilisation’ to be permitted some erotic freedom in Tarzan The Ape Man (1932), in which Maureen O’Sullivan and Johnny Weissmuller wore skimpy outfits, which, from some angles, made them appear naked. But then, the censors pounced. And by the next film in the series, they had ‘modestly covered Tarzan and Jane in almost comically baggy costumes’. Unsurprisingly, it was randy Europeans who introduced sex to Hollywood. In Ekstase, a Czech film of 1933, a young Hedy Lamarr is shown in obvious post-orgasmic bliss. The film was duly seized by U.S. Customs and prosecuted for obscenity. But America couldn’t keep out Marlene Dietrich, and they had their own sex goddess in the hourglass form of naughty Mae West, who had her own way of outfoxing the morality police. In I’m No Angel (1933), she saucily adjusts her gown and then purrs, ‘Am I making myself clear, boys?’ There was nothing censorable about the line, but nothing wholesome, either. Not much did get past the Hays Office — including Margaret Lockwood’s cleavage in The Wicked Lady (1945), the first British film to be cut before U.S. audiences were allowed to see it. Forshaw suggests the censors were so distracted by Jane Russell’s gravity-defying embonpoint in The Outlaw (1943) that they missed distinct hints of homoeroticism elsewhere in the film. Today, the restrictions — no horizontal embraces, no ‘excessive’ kissing, no suggestion of intercourse outside marriage — seem comical. In Casablanca (1942), there could be no hint of a ‘sex affair’ between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, so audiences had to decide for themselves what he meant when he said: ‘We’ll always have Paris.’ Memories of an outing up the Eiffel Tower? Probably not. In the Fifties and Sixties, such strictures began to crumble — not that the ‘sex comedies’ starring Doris Day and Rock Hudson were anything other than irreproachably conservative, prompting comedian Oscar Levant to say that he’d known Doris Day ‘before she was a virgin’. Even in Britain, old censorship habits died hard, with county councils allowed to overrule certificates dished out by the British Board of Film Classification, as several did with Saturday Night And Sunday Morning (1960), on the grounds that Albert Finney’s priapic, working-class hero was an affront to the reputation of decent factory workers. Throughout cinematic history, of course, the greater the puritanical outrage generated by a film, the more people have wanted to see it. That was notably so of Bernardo Bertolucci’s film Last Tango In Paris (1972), starring Marlon Brando — and it also ‘possibly helped the sales of a certain kitchen commodity utilised as a sexual lubricant’. Butter, in short. But Last Tango only pushed at certain boundaries, and obeyed the unwritten law that female nudity is more acceptable than male. The tumescent penis to this day is not often seen in mainstream cinema (indeed, in Fifty Shades Of Grey, Jamie Dornan’s Christian seems to have no genitalia at all). Forshaw offers one good explanation: limp apparatus in a sex scene would give the game away — the game being the many cameramen, boom operators and make-up artists who, by all accounts, make genuine arousal on a film set a near-impossibility. Forshaw’s book is a work of scholarship, not gossip, but that doesn’t stop him dropping mischievous references to the rampant ironies yielded by more than a century of sex on the screen. The thoroughly chaste Brief Encounter (1945) is often cited by moralists as a perfect example of how romance can be depicted without sex, but Forshaw notes gleefully that the film’s director, David Lean, was well-known for his energetic promiscuity, and its writer, Noel Coward, for his homosexuality. An acquaintance of mine told me years ago that he’d once checked in at the Palace Hotel in St Moritz behind Noel Coward and his long-time companion, Graham Payn, and that Coward startled the stiff, Swiss receptionist by fruitily announcing himself and Payn as ‘Mr and Mrs Noel Coward’. His was a very different world to that of Brief Encounter. But then, sex on screen — or the lack of it — has always unfolded in a parallel universe. That’s the magic of the movies.","The depiction of sex on the big screen has changed hugely over the years .

"As the flame of a large, household candle approaches my hair, I fight back the very natural instinct to panic and yank my head away. Everyone knows what happens when naked flames and hair meet: it rarely ends well. I still wince when I recall seeing my daughter’s hair catch light during a candlelit carol service years ago. Her long hair swung forward into the candle she was holding and went up like a torch. Thankfully, only an inch or two burned before the flame fizzled out, but it gave us all a shock. Scroll down for video . The technique orginates from Brazil and promises to rid your whole head of split ends, not just the bottom of you hair (picture posed by model) With that vision in mind, I try not to flinch as Nando Lopes, education director at Richard Ward Hair and Metrospa in Chelsea, London, inches into view. He is the man with the candle — and he is about to set fire to a twisted flank of my hair. It may sound insane, but what he is doing is an age-old Brazilian hair-smoothing technique called velaterapia, which gets rid of split ends — and Candle Clinic is the latest treatment on offer at this swish super-salon. Richard Ward is famous for tending the tresses of the Middleton sisters, so I feel I am in safe hands. He wouldn’t offer a treatment that would turn a royal into a real-life Miss Havisham, would he? ‘It sounds crazy,’ says Nando, ‘but it works, 100 per cent. It’s the best way to get rid of split ends. If we try to cut split ends out, it is impossible — it takes for ever. But by burning them, you catch all of them.’ Split ends, where the ends of the hair shaft split in two, are inconvenient for anyone trying to grow their hair. As hair gets older, it becomes more likely to split, as the protective cuticle around each strand becomes worn. Split ends aren’t a problem, as such, but they make hair look frizzy and rough. Although conditioner can smooth these cuticles down so they are less obvious, nothing will actually mend a split end. Usually, the only answer is to cut them off. Championed by Victoria’s Secret supermodels Alessandra Ambrosio and Isabeli Fontana, velaterapia — better known as ‘candle cutting’ — instead uses a flame to singe away split ends and effectively cauterize the hair, creating a sturdy seal that makes it less prone to split again. How it works is simple. Nando, who learned the technique from a Brazilian stylist, takes a section of my hair and twizzles it into a tight twist about as thick as a pencil. He pulls it taut and away from my head, and I can see the tiny ends of shorter hairs sticking out. Then, he takes the candle and lets the flame lick up and down the twist of hair. The tiny, sticking-out ends flare up, making me wince in alarm. But just as I’m about to panic that my crowning glory is going up in smoke, the burning ends fizzle out. The unpleasant smell of singed hair gets stronger as Nando works around my head, tiny section by tiny section. It looks as though the flame is licking over his fingers, too, though he says it doesn’t hurt. ‘The hair doesn’t catch fire as it is twisted so tightly,’ he says. ‘Only the bits that stick out get singed. It melts the ends together and seals them, so it’s a clever way of getting rid of split ends all the way down the hair. That’s why it’s great for keeping long hair smooth — if you have a trim, you only catch the split ends at the very bottom.’ I last had my hair cut three months ago, so there are likely a fair number of split ends. I think a lot of what is going up in flames is just hair that hasn’t grown the full length of the twist. It doesn’t stand a chance. The technique is becoming hugely popular. Word is spreading fast, and it’s catching on (sorry) like wildfire. Nando already treats ten heads a week — at £195 a go — and he’s now training other hairdressers in the art of the candle. For good measure, Nando waves the candle under the tuft at the end of each twist. I fear all these burnt bits will be left rough and bobbly — but when I feel them, there is no roughness. The whole thing has taken just half-an-hour. Once my hair has been washed to get rid of the candle smuts, it is indulged with a ten-minute intense conditioning treatment, then blow-dried. It has rarely felt so smooth. I’m delighted and impressed. But I must say, don’t try this at home! From £195, richardward.com.

"We are spending so much time composing messages on emails, texts and tweets, that handwritten letters have become a rarity. But in a strange twist, digital technology rather than humans could help save the art of handwriting, if one robot system has its way. Dubbed 'Bond', the system combines MakerBot 3D printers, Montblanc pens and a mobile app to write messages in any cursive. Scroll down for video . The 'Bond' system combines 3D printers, Montblanc pens and an app to write hand written messages . Users start by submitting a handwriting sample online.  The Bond software studies this to identify how the customers writes each letter of the alphabet. Customers can then choose a blank card from the Bond website, and send in the typed text that they want to appear in the space. One of 11 Bond robots will then write the text in the card with a real pen controlled by a 3D printer, which will subsequently be mailed. Users can also choose a different handwriting from their own. 'Nobody has ever said, ""You know what's awesome? I had the best experience at American Greetings,:' Sonny Caberwal, founder and CEO of Bond told Fast Company. 'We have really set out to reimagine what that would look like - how we can create a truly personal experience that lets people deliver that personal touch that is truly theirs, but let them do it from anywhere,' Bond imitates human handwriting using fluid movements and differing pressures to make the cursive look authentic. Mimicking human handwriting is deceptively difficult and there are thought to be thousands of ways that letters can be connected together. The robot must adopt human-like amounts of pressure on certain joins and letters - perhaps such as dotting an I - as well as not smudging the writing to make it looks authentic. The robot forms part of an app and gift service for people with more money than time, effectively allowing them to send handwritten cards from their iPhone. Users start by submitting a handwriting sample online. The Bond software studies this to identify how the customers writes each letter of the alphabet. They can then choose a blank card from the Bond website, and send in the typed text that they want to appear in the space .

"One of three Al-Jazeera journalists arrested for flying a drone in Paris will appear in court next week where he is expected to plead guilty, a judicial source said on Thursday. The other two journalists have been freed. All three were arrested on Wednesday for flying a drone in the Bois de Boulogne park on the western edge of the French capital. Their arrest followed two nights of mysterious drone sightings over the French capital, although a source with knowledge of the case said the journalists were not involved in the earlier incidents. Fear: Drones were spotted flying near the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried . Alert: Paris was on alert for a new terror attack after 'at least' five drones were spotted illegally flying around city landmarks, including the U.S. embassy building (pictured) Tension: Drones were also seen flying around the world-famous Eiffel Tower . New threat: French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. The above drone crashed on the grass near the White House in the United States last month . A map showing where the drones have been sighted in Paris . Those unexplained sightings were made near the US embassy, not far from the Invalides military museum, the Eiffel Tower and several major thoroughfares leading in and out of the French capital, police said. Flying drones over the capital is illegal under French law. The names and nationalities of the three journalists from Al-Jazeera's international service, two of whom were freelancers, were not given. They are aged 34, 52 and 68. They are thought to have been filming a segment on drones. Only the journalist who actually flew the drone will face court, where he will plead guilty, the judicial source said. The drone, which was supplied by the station's London office in November, has been confiscated. French security sources where unable to catch the drones, which are typically fitted with cameras and can be used for target surveillance to assess security and any spikes in pedestrian footfall ahead of a planned attack. A judicial source earlier told AFP: 'The first was piloting the drone, the second was filming and the third was watching.' Police sighted one or more drones in five instances buzzing in the Paris sky in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday - from 11.30pm to 2am. An unidentified flying object was first seen Tuesday night near the Gare de l'Est train station, with sightings continuing in sequence for over two hours over the Paris Opera, then on to the Tuileries gardens, past the Eiffel Tower and then south past Paris' Montparnasse Tower, according to Thibault-Lecuivre. Location: At some point between midnight and 6am on Monday, drone aircraft were spotted flying near Bastille Square . Tourist hotspot: The first drone sighting in the French capital was around midnight on Monday. Shortly after an unmanned aircraft was seen flying near the Place de la Concorde . An inquiry was launched after drones, which are banned over Paris, were also spotted Monday night - beginning over the U.S. Embassy at around midnight on Monday. Between then and 6am the Eiffel Tower, Bastille Square, the Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum 'were also flown over' , a security source said. France has experienced a series of mysterious drone appearances in the last few months. On January 20, a pilotless aircraft briefly went over the presidential palace in Paris, while around 20 drones were earlier seen flying above nuclear power plants. However until Tuesday 'there have never been so many drones appearing in one night,' the security source said. The emergence of drones comes amid warnings by terrorist groups that they will attack the city, following January shootings which left a total of 20 dead, including three terrorists. There have been other mysterious drone flights across Paris, but this is the first time that such a concentrated number have been seen above so many potentially vulnerable targets. The US embassy has been threatened by numerous groups in the past, from Al-Qaeda to Algeria’s Armed Islamic Group. French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. Experts say that the small unmanned craft would not pose a threat if crashed into a hardened nuclear facility. Fightback: Earlier this month France unveiled its latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net . Caught: In a demonstration in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month . France has barred six 'would-be jihadists' from leaving the country after discovering their plans to travel to Syria and join the Islamic State terror group. It the first such travel ban under a new law aimed at preventing French Islamic radicals travelling to the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq currently under the control of Sunni extremists. French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve says some 40 other French citizens will face travel bans in the coming weeks. He did not reveal the identity of the six people whose passports have already been confiscated. The bans are the first since a sweeping anti-terrorism law passed in France last year. The government is especially worried since attacks in Paris last month killed 20 people, including three gunmen claiming ties to Islamic extremists in Syria and Yemen. An Interior Ministry official says the passports and ID cards of the six have been declared invalid for six months - a measure that can be extended for up to two years. The news comes just days after Cazeneuve said he asked Google, Facebook and Twitter to work directly with French officials during investigations and to immediately remove terrorist propaganda when authorities alert them to it. Earlier this month France unveiled its latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net. In a demonstration flight in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month. The U.S. Secret Service was sent scrambling by the unexpected intrusion, but France has already faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites. Mystery drones have buzzed nuclear plants, military installations and even the presidential palace in recent months, as fears run high of terror attacks linked to the Islamic State terror group. Concerned at the new technology, officials have asked scientists and companies to develop ways to monitor and detect intruding drones and their remote-control pilots; analyse and track their flight paths; and ultimately neutralise the drones, either temporarily or permanently, with the least collateral damage possible. Last October it emerged that holidaymakers who are planning to fly a camera-equipped drone in Paris’ tourist zones risk spending time in jail and being slapped with a hefty fine. An Israeli tourist found out the hard way this week when he was arrested in front of Notre Dame Cathedral while flying a drone above some of Paris’ top attractions.","Two other journalists arrested over the incident have been freed .

"Westminster Abbey is to add a £19million Gothic tower - its first new building in 270 years - as part of major plans to create a new museum and exhibition space. The tower will allow public access to the Abbey's eastern Triforium gallery, which will be turned into a museum called The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries. Exhibits will include a selection of treasures, including royal funeral effigies, silverware and stonework. The 14th century Liber Regalis manuscript and a crimson velvet cope worn by the Dean of Westminster at Charles II's coronation will also be on display. New tower: This before-and-after view shows what Westminster Abbey will look like with the new Gothic tower, seen in the centre of the image as an artist's impression . The project is the most significant addition to the fabric of the Abbey church since the construction of Nicholas Hawksmoor's west towers in 1745. It is expected to open in early 2018 after Westminster council approved the plans this week. The Triforium  gallery runs 70 feet above the floor of the Abbey and around almost all its internal walls. When Henry III began to rebuild the Abbey church in the 13th century, he planned to house chapels at the east end of the Triforium, but the idea was never followed through. Plans to open up the gallery will give visitors views along the whole length of the Abbey  and create a new and much larger museum and an exhibition space. The tower, which will reflect the Gothic architecture of the Abbey church, will be 'substantial but largely hidden from view' and 'should be entirely in keeping with the historic fabric of the Abbey', according to a statement released online last year. It has been designed by the Abbey's Surveyor of the Fabric, consultant architect, Ptolemy Dean. The Very Rev John Hall, the Dean of Westminster, said: 'We are delighted that our proposals for the new tower and for opening the eastern Triforium to the public have the support of Westminster City Council, reflecting that of our local community and of other bodies concerned for the preservation of the local and national heritage. Model: This to-scale replica of Westminster Abbey shows the skeleton of the new tower, centre, which will be largely hidden from view . On display: The 14th century Liber Regalis manuscript, pictured, will be on show in the exhibition space along with a selection of treasures . 'This planning approval will enable us to approach with confidence the final stages of the necessary fund-raising and drive us towards the timely completion and opening of The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries, the most exciting development of the Abbey building for over 250 years.' Famous writers including Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy and Rudyard Kipling are buried in the 900-year-old Abbey, as well as 17 monarchs. Robert Davis, deputy leader of Westminster City Council, said: 'In a city full of spectacular buildings, Westminster Abbey stands out not only for its architectural merit but for the fundamental role it plays in our cultural and civic life. 'I am certain that this new tower, which will give people access to some of the abbey's previously hidden treasures, will be an attractive and successful addition to the city's heritage.' Much of the present building was built during the reign of King Henry III. In 1245 he pulled down the eastern part of the 11th century Abbey, which had been founded by King Edward the Confessor and dedicated in 1065. It is said that Henry's devotion to St Edward later prompted him to build a more magnificent church in the newest Gothic style, and also to provide a new shrine for the Saint. The architect was  influenced by the new cathedrals that had been built in Reims, Amiens and Chartres at the time, and used characteristic Gothic features of pointed arches, ribbed vaulting and rose windows in his design. The Abbey has the highest Gothic vault in England - nearly 102 feet - and the narrow aisles were made to make it seem even higher. By 1269 the apse, radiating chapels, transepts and choir were complete and the new shrine received the bones of St Edward on 13 October. The next major addition to the building was the construction of a new Lady Chapel by Henry VII between 1503 and 1519 to replace the 13th century chapel. The architecture in this part of the Abbey contrasts with the rest and no records for this building have been found. The last phase of building was the completion in 1745 of the West Towers in Portland stone, to a design by Nicholas Hawksmoor, the Abbey's Surveyor. The new power is expected to open in early 2018 after Westminster council approved the plans this week.","Tower will be added as part of major plans to create a new museum and exhibition space in Westminster Abbey .

"Former University of Louisville basketball player Chris Jones pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges of rape and sodomy, days after being dismissed from the team. Jones, 23, appeared in Jefferson District Court before Judge Sheila Collins immediately after turning himself in to authorities. He was released to home incarceration. He did not speak during the brief hearing. His attorney, Scott Cox, said Jones is cooperating with the police investigation. 'We believe this gentleman is innocent and he's been falsely accused, and he's going to be found not guilty,' he said. Chris Jones, 23, is handcuffed on Thursday as he appeared in a Louisville, Kentucky court on to plead not guilty to rape and sodomy charges . Athlete: Chris Jones, left is seen in a February 16 game against Rutgers. Jones has pleaded not guilty   to charges of rape and sodomy, days after being dismissed from the team . The allegations involved two women, and the rape is said to have occurred February 22 at a private apartment off-campus, university police said during a news conference. One of the women was identified as a University of Louisville student. Police warrants have alleged that Jones committed the crimes on Sunday. An arrest warrant obtained by Sports Illustrated alleged that Jones forced a woman have both anal and vaginal intercourse on Sunday. The victim identified Jones 'because she recognized him as a University of Louisville basketball player and he also told victim #1 his name,' the warrant said. The news outlet obtained another warrant, which alleged that on Sunday, a second alleged victim was forced to have oral sex and vaginal intercourse by Jones and two others. That alleged victim identified Jones as a college basketball player for Louisville, the warrant said. Two others are charged in the alleged attack on the second woman. Jalen D. Tilford is charged with rape and sodomy, and Tyvon Julah Walker is charged with rape. The two, who are not students, were arrested. The judge set a bond of $75,000 for Tilford and $100,000 for Walker. Jones has withdrawn from classes at the university and has moved out of the athletic dorm and into a hotel room, Cox said. It's the latest turn over nine tumultuous days for Jones, who was dismissed from the team Sunday. That came three days after he was reinstated following a one-game suspension on February 17 for violating an unspecified team rule. Coach Rick Pitino said Jones returned to the team after meeting unspecified conditions for reinstatement. Suspects: Jalen D. Tilford, left, is charged with rape and sodomy, and Tyvon Julah Walker, right,  is charged with rape . Jones then scored 17 points in Saturday's victory over Miami before his dismissal was announced a day later in a one-sentence release saying there would be no comment. In a Thursday statement, Louisville sports information director Kenny Klein said 'On Feb. 17 while at a team dinner, Coach Rick Pitino was informed of a text message sent by Chris Jones to another individual. Chris was removed from the dinner table, immediately suspended from the team. After the matter was addressed within the university and Chris surrendered his cell phone, he was permitted to return to the team on Feb. 19 with strict internal disciplinary measures attached, among which included a curfew. It was discovered shortly after noon on Feb. 22 that Chris had violated a curfew and there were other accusations, without knowing specifics. At that time, Chris was immediately dismissed from the team. 'While Chris is no longer a member of our team, we understand that the allegations are very serious. While we cannot comment on this ongoing investigation, we certainly expect our student-athletes to uphold certain standards, including their treatment of others. We have great respect for the legal process and our university procedures and we will cooperate as requested with this matter.' A Louisville campus police report obtained Monday stated that Jones, a Memphis native, sent a woman a text threatening to 'smack' her on Feb. 17. No charges were filed against Jones, but he was suspended from the team hours later and did not travel with Louisville to a game at Syracuse. Jones' dismissal left the No. 17 Cardinals without their assists leader (3.7 per game) and No. 3 scorer (13.7 points). They beat Georgia Tech 52-51 Monday night without him. After that game Pitino said, 'I feel awful for the young man. There's certain rules where you can work with people, and other rules where you've got to move on. Unfortunately, we've got to move on. They're like your children. You don't like to see anybody be hurt. But there's also accountability and doing the right things. He didn't. Now, he's got to get his life together, get on with life. There's no way he's coming back. It's over.'","Chris Jones pleaded not guilty to rape and sodomy charges on Thursday .

"In a moment of need, many people call on God to help them. Now, a study has found that just being reminded of God gives people the courage to seek out and take risks. Psychologists suggest that religious people are willing to take risks because they believe God will protect them from harm. A study has found that reminders of God give people courage to seek out and take risks. For example, those who saw adverts included a mention of God – for example, ‘God knows what you’re missing! Find skydiving near you,’ were more inclined to click on it, with a view to taking risks . The study, published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, goes against previous research that suggest religious people are less likely to engage in risky behaviour, such as gambling. From bumper stickers to colloquial expressions, references to God pervade daily life, said lead researcher Daniella Kupor of Stanford University Graduate School of Business. ‘In fact, the word “God” is one of the most common nouns in the English language. ‘The fact that reminders of God are so ubiquitous suggests that this effect may impact a large number of people.’ Previous studies have indicated religious people are less likely to gamble or take drugs – seen as risky behaviours – but Ms Kupor and her colleagues noticed that the risks examined in these studies tended to share a negative moral component. Psychologists suggest that religious people (illustrated with a stock image) are willing to take risks because they believe God will protect them from harm . An free app called Instapray lets people send prayers or words of encouragement - regardless of religious persuasion - to others who are having a difficult time. This can be in the form of public posts, or in private groups with friends as well as strangers. A ticker on the site shows that more than 33 million prayers have been posted using the app in 195 countries, which is the equivalent of 192 years of prayers. The name isn't restricted to religious people, it can be used by anyone with spiritual beliefs or people who want to discover and discuss world events. Members of the Instapray community can post prayers and encouragement publicly or create private groups. They can also join more broad-based groups that focus on global issues concerning peace in the Middle East, victims of natural disasters, or a cure for Ebola, for example. The researchers hypothesised that thinking about God may have a different effect in relation to risks that have no moral connotation, such as doing a bungee jump, since people tend to view God as a source of protection and security. To investigate, they issued online surveys to nearly 900 people and found that those who were reminded of God - either by working on word scrambles that included God-related words or by reading a paragraph about God - were more willing to take risks than participants who weren’t prompted to think about religion. In one study, for example, participants were asked to choose which version of the study they wanted to complete. One version would give them a small bonus payment, but involved looking at an ‘extremely bright colour’ that they were told could potentially damage their eyes, while the other version involved looking at a harmless darker colour. The researchers found that participants who had been reminded of God before making their choice were more likely to opt for the dangerous version of the experiment – at 96 per cent – than those who hadn’t been reminded of God, at 84 per cent. In another study, the researchers posted variations of three adverts online and recorded the click-through rates for each. Some adverts promoted an immoral risk, such as ‘learn how to bribe,’ others promoted a non-moral risk, such as ‘find skydiving near you’ and another set promoted no risk, such as ‘find amazing video games’. Previous studies have indicated religious people are less likely to gamble (stock image) or take drugs – seen as risky behaviours – but Ms Kupor and her colleagues noticed that the risks examined in these studies tended to share a negative moral component . In some cases, the adverts included a mention of God – for example, ‘God knows what you’re missing! Find skydiving near you.’ The research revealed that when the adverts included a religious reference, people clicked on the non-moral risk of skydiving, more often. However, they clicked on the bribing - moral risk - less often. People clicked about the same number of times on the computer games advert, with or without a mention of God. ‘We were surprised to find that even a simple colloquial expression - “God knows what you’re missing” - influences whether people click on a real online ad that is promoting a risky behaviour,’ Ms Kupor said. The study also  indicated that people who were reminded of God perceived less danger in various risky behaviours than participants who were not reminded of God. And they reported more negative feelings toward God when they lost their potential winnings in a risk-related game, suggesting that they had expected God to protect them from losing the money and were disappointed in the outcome. The researchers noted that this effect may apply to people from cultures in which God is not seen as a protective force.","Study by Stanford University suggests people are willing to take risks because they believe God will protect them from harm .
Contradicts previous research that hinted religious people are risk averse .

"Hours after his ex-wife was found dead in her bathtub, a frantic doctor asked whether he was a monster and if he was responsible for her death, according to the couple's daughter. Malkie Wall, now 19, testified on Thursday at her father's murder trial in Salt Lake City, Utah. Uta von Schwedler, a 48-year-old University of Utah biologist, was found dead in her Salt Lake City bathtub in September 2011 with knife wounds on her body and a fatal level of Xanax in her system. Miss Wall said that Dr John Brickman Wall had a mental breakdown when he returned from a police interview. 'He said,""Yes, I don't think I did it, but maybe I did. Maybe I did do it. Am I a monster? I could be a monster,""' Miss Wall told jurors. John Brickman Wall (pictured in court on Monday) asked his daughter whether he was a monster and said 'maybe I did do it' according to Malkie Wall's testimony in his murder trial . Prosecutors allege her 51-year-old ex-husband killed her during a bitter custody battle, but defense attorneys say she could have killed herself. A medical examiner ruled she drowned, but stopped short of ruling whether her death was a homicide or a suicide. Lawyer Fred Metos has said aggressive police questioning made Wall question his own sanity. and he was treated at a psychiatric facility shortly after the police interview. Malkie Wall said her parents fought about how to raise the children and money, and on one occasion her father physically removed her mother from his front yard. The last time she saw her mother was Sept. 26, 2011, before Wall picked her up along with her three siblings to go back to his house. Ms Von Schwedler wanted to talk to Wall about an upcoming trip to California she was planning to take with the two younger children, but he ignored her and drove away. Wall was questioned the following night by police  after his ex-wife was found dead. He returned home after 3am and told his daughter 'Your mom's dead and they think I did it.' Uta von Schwedler, a 48-year-old University of Utah biologist, was found dead with stab wounds and a fatal dose of Xanax in her system . 'He was crying. He was not with it,' Malkie Wall said, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The young woman testified that her father never admitted to killing her mother. When Ms Wall had woken up in his house that morning, she went looking for him to find medicine because she'd stepped on a bee at cross country practice the day before. Wall was nowhere in the house, and she couldn't reach him by text or phone call. Eventually, she walked to the train station and went to school and he picked her up from piano lessons in the afternoon. Prosecutors say Wall had the interior of his car shampooed that morning, and he told car wash employee Anthony Izarras to pay special attention to light pink drip stains behind the driver's seat. Mr Izarras testified that he thought the request was a little odd because the car was otherwise clean. Wall also had cuts on his forearms and an eye bleeding internally, but told both his daughter and police that they were from the family dog. Thursday's testimony came during the final day of the second week of Wall's murder trial. Ms Von Schwedler's death was initially treated as a suicide, but family and friends, including their oldest son, called for more investigation. Wall was charged more than a year after her death in a largely circumstantial case. Malkie Wall said Thursday that her mother did not appear depressed or suicidal leading up to her death.","John Brickman Wall, 51, of Salt Lake City, Utah, charged with murder of wife in 2011 .

"Guerrilla street artist Banksy has released a satirical travel advert - for trips to the Gaza Strip. After travelling to the war-torn region, the elusive artist, who keeps his identity under wraps, posted the video, which shows what life is like for Palestinians living there. In the spoof travel video, he invites the audience to 'Make this the year YOU discover a new destination' while setting the pitiful scene, showing bomb damage and rubble. Beginning in a tunnel, the video describes Gaza  as 'well away from the tourist track,' before adding  'access is via a network of illegal tunnels'. 'The locals like it so much they never leave,' it says, continuing 'because they're not allowed to'. Viewers are privy to a selection of haunting images from children playing among tumble-down buildings to the severe bomb damage in the region, the result of a 50-day conflict which left 3,000 injured and over 500 Palestinian children dead. A girl stands infront of a mural of a  kitten,  by Banksy, on a housedestroyed by Israeli shelling, in Biet Hanoun . A mural in Biet Hanoun town, northern Gaza, shows children swinging from a surveillance tower . The anonymous graffiti artist also created some of his trademark spray painted artwork among the rubble . The video also desribes Gaza as nestling 'in an exclusive setting (surrounded by a wall on three sides and a line of gun boats on the other), watched over by friendly neighbours (in 2014 Operation Protective Edge destroyed 18,000 homes).' And as footage from a drone strike is shown, subtitles read: 'Development opportunities are everywhere.' The anonymous graffiti artist also created some of his trademark spray painted artwork among the  rubble, including a stencil of children swinging from a surveillance tower. Viewers are privy to haunting images such as children playing among bomb damaged buildings . The video shows the squalid conditions Gaza  after the war between Islamist Hamas rulers and Israel . At one point viewers get a glimpse of him, though his face is hidden under a hooded sweatshirt. As usual with Banksy's thought-provoking work the short video has a strong message. 'This cat tells the whole world that she is missing joy in her life,' a local man says, pointing to one of the artists paintings, a cat on the side of a crumbling wall. 'The cat found something to play with. What about our children? Satirical: The artist's shocking short film takes the format of a typical travel promotion . As usual with Banksy's thought-provoking work the short video has a strong political message . The short film closes with a handpainted message, scrawled on a wall in red paint: 'If we wash our hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless we side with the powerful - we don't remain neutral.' The Bristolian artist's true identity remains a closely guarded secret. It's thought that his  refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism. He has been photographed in the past but always wearing a mask or hood. This air of mystery  has helped Banksy to become one of the most successful artists of his generation.","Elusive artist travelled undercover to Gaza to create art among the rubble .

"Six schoolchildren had to be rushed to hospital this morning after taking legal highs before school. The alarm was raised at Lealands High School, in Luton, after a pupil collapsed and was taken to the medical centre when he took an unknown legal high. Ambulances were called at just after 8.30am but, before they arrived, another two pupils had fainted while three more began to complain of feeling dizzy and nauseous. All the teenagers were then rushed to the nearby Luton and Dunstable Hospital. Scroll down for video . Six pupils at Lealands High School (pictured), in Luton, had to be rushed to hospital this morning after taking legal highs before school . Police confirmed the six students had all taken the same legal high this morning. But a parent claimed that even the teenagers themselves weren't sure exactly what substance they took. One female pupil at the school, who would not be named, said: 'A year seven boy was given it by a year nine student but he went into the atrium and collapsed and the doors were closed. 'After he fainted the other pupils who took it started getting ill too. An ambulance arrived in period one and helped them.' Her mother, who also has another teenage daughter at the school, blamed the incident of falling discipline standards at the school. She said: 'Since the new headteacher took over the school has got a lot worse. The children at the school frequently get into a lot of trouble. Three pupils collapsed and another three became dizzy after taking an unknown legal high this morning (pictured is mephedrone, a legal high, known as meow meow, white magic, drone, bubble and MCAT, which was legal until April 2010) 'This probably happened at the breakfast club which the school holds before classes start. 'They are allowed to do what they want and go outside if they want to so they probably had it then.' A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance service said the pupils, a mixture of boys and girls, were all discharged from hospital this afternoon. 'We treated six patients who were unwell,' he added. 'Three of them had collapsed and the other three were feeling dizzy.' Detective Sergeant Sandra Evans said police were called 'following concern for the health of several pupils who had fallen unwell after taking what was believed to be a 'legal high' before coming to school. 'Six students, all in their teens, were taken to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital suffering from a variety of symptoms and were later discharged,' she added. All six teenagers were  rushed to the nearby Luton and Dunstable Hospital (pictured) but were discharged later this afternoon . 'We'd like to take this opportunity to remind people that just because a substance is marketed as being 'legal', it does not mean it is safe. 'It's not always clear what ingredients such substances are made up of, or what effect it is likely to have on you.' Police said this was the first report of any incident involving legal highs at the school and are offering to work with them to educate pupils on the dangers of the drugs. Headteacher John Burridge said all pupils had been offered support after the incident. He said: 'Before arriving at school six students from different year groups appear to have become very unwell. 'We first became aware of this when one of these students attended the medical room on arrival at school. We immediately contacted the ambulance service and then it emerged that other students were suffering similar symptoms. The pupils were taken to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital for further assessment and care. 'At this stage we are not certain of the cause of their symptoms. We have advised all pupils about the incident and have offered support if they have any concerns, however we are not aware that any other students are affected. 'Our absolute primary concern at this stage is the welfare and wellbeing of the students who are now in the hands of medical professionals.' 'All pupils were discharged earlier today in the care of their parents.' The CSJ says many legal highs are sold in 'head shops', of which there are close to 250 in the UK. File picture of a head shop in Dublin . Drugs experts have warned that deaths linked to ‘legal highs’ could overtake those linked to heroin by 2016. Deaths increased eightfold, rising from 12 in 2009 to 97 in 2012, according to figures from Centre for Social Justice who claim the UK has the highest rate of legal highs use among young people in Europe. Only last August, father-of-three Michael McKay, 33, from Arbroath, Angus, passed away at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee following a five-month addiction to new psychoactive substances (NPS), which caused him severe heart problems. In 2013, Adam Hunt, 18, died four days after taking the psychoactive substance AMT at his home in Southampton, Hampshire, after purchasing it from a website. In the same year, keen sportsman Jimmy Guichard, 20, suffered a heart attack and severe brain damage within hours of taking one of the herbal substances. The soaring death toll led to ministers calling the rise in the use of legal highs a 'national emergency'. Currently drug laws in Europe and North America only ban the use and sale of specific substances. This means new compounds developed by chemists can be sold without fear of prosecution until they are added to the list of controlled substances. Mephedrone, created by Dr Z and sold over the internet as plant food, caused at least one death and has been implicated in at least 13 others. The drug became popular among clubbers in 2007 as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for ecstasy. Mephedrone's popularity gave rise to a whole new market for legal highs sold over the internet. Loss: 18-year-old Adam Hunt who died after taking a so-called 'legal high' he bought off the internet . When the substance was finally banned in 2010, a range of other novel synthesised drugs had sprung up to take its place. They include psychoactive substances (NPS) and 6-APB, known commonly as Benzo Fury. Those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators, with chemists synthesising new substances faster them Parliament can ban them, spawning a whole industry to feed Britain's hunger for mind-altering substances. However, unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known, the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery.","Six pupils had taken legal highs before attending Lealands High School .

"Tony Abbott's sister says the Prime Minister was the most supportive of their family when she left her husband of 20 years after falling in love with a woman despite him not supporting same-sex marriage. Christine Forster had what looked like the 'perfectly happy suburban marriage' with four beautiful children until she met Virginia Edwards in 2003 when their sons went to the same school. 'I grew up in an environment where there was never any opportunity from me to pursue a same sex relationship - it wasn't something that was ever even considered remotely, she said on The Feed. 'But as soon as I met Virginia I knew she was somebody I was attracted to.' The City of Sydney councillor is a staunch member of the Liberal party and may soon enter NSW politics herself but does support marriage equality unlike her beloved brother. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott's sister, Christine Forster (left), says the Prime Minister (right) was the most supportive of their family when she left her husband of 20 years after falling in love with a woman . Christine (right) had what looked like the 'perfectly happy suburban marriage' with four beautiful children until she met Virginia Edwards (left) in 2003 when their sons went to the same school . Despite Mr Abbott's strong traditional beliefs about marriage he is accepting of his sister's relationship with Virginia Edwards. 'Tony was, out of all of my immediate family members, the most supportive - people raise my eyebrows when I say this but it is the honest truth,' she said. 'When I told him what was going on his response was ""what ever you think you have to do I will support you"".' Virginia said she has never been treated as an outcast in the Abbott household. 'Outwardly and from the love he has shown me - he certainly hasn't made me feel as if I'm not welcome and I'm not loved,' she said. Despite Mr Abbott's strong traditional beliefs about marriage he is accepting of his sister's gay relationship . However, this does not mean that the couple are happy about Mr Abbott's stance on marriage equality. 'Of course it hurts and that's why Christine and I stood our ground,' Virginia said. 'I think he's wrong but he's entitled to his view and it would be great if he turned around tomorrow and said ""I've had a change of heart"",' Christine added. Christine was also quick to defend her brother's view on the divisive issue. 'He's not saying that he doesn't see my relationship with Virginia as valid,' she said. 'He's just saying that he doesn't believe that we should come under this umbrella of the institution of marriage because as he sees marriage.... he sees it as that it has to be between a man and a woman.' Although the women accept Mr Abbott's stance on gay marriage they hope he will one day change his mind . This is not to say if same-sex marriage was passed as a law that Mr Abbott wouldn't attend a wedding for the couple. 'He may not want it to be legalised but if it were he has told us he would be at our marriage,' Virginia said. And Mr Abbott playing a pivotal role within the ceremony has also not been ruled out . 'Page boy Tony - I don't know maybe - we will see him in a little blue velvet cap, we'll wait and see,' Virginia said. Virginia (left) said she has never felt anything but loved and welcome by Mr Abbott (second from left) Both women are the first to admit that it was not an easy decision to completely turn their worlds upside down to be together. 'We were both married and that meant we had to make very difficult decisions about our relationships of course with our ex-husbands and also about what that meant for our children - it's indescribably difficult,' Christine said. 'To suddenly kind of dump on people who haven't gone through the inner process that you've gone through that ""hey guys I'm really sorry but this it not how it works for me"" is a terrible thing.' Virginia said coming out is a big step whether you're a LLL - a late life lesbian - or a WLL - a whole life lesbian. 'I was terrified I couldn't imagine how I was going to manage the outfall of emotion that was going to come with this decision and the hurt,' she said. 'But I knew the love that I had for Christine was something that I couldn't live without.'

"A former Little League mom has revealed how a car accident left her in so much pain she became a heroin addict and stole thousands of dollars to fund her habit. Nicole Koester, 42, who is now serving 13-and-a-half years at Maryland Correctional Institution for Women spoke to Diane Sawyer as part of an ABC special, 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', which will air on Friday night. The married mother-of-three, who had been the manager of a car company, explained how she would watch Sawyer in the mornings as she packed lunchboxes for her children. But after suffering a car crash, she was prescribed oxycodone for her pain - but soon she had moved on to heroin, which was cheaper, she said. Life changing: Nicole Koester, 42, was a married mother-of-three who managed a car company but she is now serving 13-and-a-half years at Maryland Correctional Institution for check fraud . 'It just happened,' she said. 'It was for pain and then I realized it made everything so easy. 'Every night you're not doing it anymore - you're done, you're done, you're done - until the next morning when you start feeling sick.' To fund her habit, she started stealing checks from other people's mailboxes before dipping them in a solution to get rid of the ink, according to a WBOC report. She then wrote the checks out to herself for amounts between $200 and $1,500 before cashing them - ultimately stealing more than $30,000 from 26 people, ABC reported. Secret life: She turned to heroin after a car crash left her in pain and she started stealing checks from mailboxes and re-writing them to herself. She is pictured in a mug shot, right, after she was caught in 2011 . Torn apart: Only one of her sons, pictured left, has visited her in prison, along with her husband . Her crimes were carried out through Maryland, Delaware and Virginia. 'Things that will hit me that I've done that I've forgotten about,' a tearful Koester told Sawyer. In 2011, she was arrested and sentenced to 13 years and six months. She now works as an office manager in the prison sewing shop, where she earns $2.75 per day, and takes part in the prison's dog program, 'Canine Partners for Life'. Her husband continues to visit her in prison but only one of her children has made the trip, she said. 'He's the only one that talks to me,' she told Sawyer of her son. 'But I mean, I ruined their lives. I'm no different from anyone in here.' New life: She now works as an office manager in the prison sewing shop, where she earns $2.75 per day . Investigation: Dianne Sawyer spoke to Koester as part of an ABC special on women locked up in prison . Sawyer told Good Morning America that Koester's story is similar to those shared by an increasing number of women behind bars: white females who turn to crime to fund painkiller habits. The veteran journalist traveled to prisons in Tennessee, Maryland, Florida and Washington for the ABC special, which will air on ABC on Friday at 10pm EST. The special was filmed over eight months. During the program, she examines mental health in a prison system where so many prisoners are ill, how prisoners acquire contraband and issues involving sentencing.

"The mother of Trayvon Martin says she's disappointed that federal prosecutors decided not to charge a neighborhood watch volunteer with a hate crime for killing her son three years ago. Speaking with The Associated Press on Wednesday before the third anniversary of her 17-year-old son's death, Sybrina Fulton says she still believes George Zimmerman got away with murder. 'He took a life, carelessly and recklessly, and he shouldn't deserve to have his entire life walking around on the street free. I just believe that he should be held accountable for what he's done,' Fulton said. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Trayvon Martin's mother says she's disappointed that federal prosecutors decided not to charge a neighborhood watch volunteer with a hate crime for killing her son three years ago . Dead: George Zimmerman shot dead unarmed teen Trayvon Martin three years ago and deemed him suspicious because he was 'wearing a hoodie' Zimmerman claimed he shot the unarmed teenager in self-defense after confronting Martin while volunteering for his neighborhood watch group. A jury acquitted him of second-degree murder the next year. The case sparked a national conversation about race, bias and crime in part because Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, was not immediately arrested after shooting Martin, who is black. The US Justice Department announced Tuesday that it found insufficient evidence to establish that Zimmerman willfully deprived Martin of his civil rights or killed him because of his race. 'The Justice Department is the top of the line here,' Fulton said. 'But what they found just wasn't enough.' Zimmerman, for his part, is relieved the case is closed, according to his attorney, Don West. 'This cloud he was under has been lifted,' West told the AP, adding that he finds it misleading to suggest that charges weren't filed only because the legal standard for federal hate crime is so tough to meet. 'There simply was never any compelling evidence that this was a federal hate crime. Race played no role in it whatsoever,' West said. Seeking justice: The parents of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton want thei son's death to be justified somehow and if not in law then in future decision making practices . Walking free: The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday that it found insufficient evidence to establish that George Zimmerman willfully deprived Martin of his civil rights or killed him because of his race . The February 2012 confrontation began after Zimmerman spotted Martin walking through the neighborhood, returning to his father's home after buying candy and a soft drink at a convenience store. Zimmerman called 911 to report a suspicious person, and got out of his car to confront Martin despite being warned by the dispatcher to stop. Zimmerman did not testify at his trial, but he told investigators he feared for his life as Martin straddled him and punched him during the ensuing fight. Wearing a T-shirt bearing a black-and-white image of her son in a hoodie, Fulton said she still longs for Zimmerman to be held responsible. 'I want to see people held accountable for what they're doing. It's just upsetting to know that a person can shoot and kill someone and justify it,' Fulton said. Changing the future: Parents Martin and Fulton, pictured at a press conference on Wednesday, have flown around the country to speak to media, youth groups, and lead rallies against racial profiling and gun violence . Fulton now channels her grief into work with The Trayvon Martin Foundation, which reaches out to other families who have lost children to violence, awards scholarships and collects school supplies for poor students. She's also watching to see how the Justice Department handles other high-profile killings of unarmed blacks. Decisions are pending on whether to charge police in New York and Ferguson, Missouri with depriving the victims of their civil rights by using excessive force in the course of duty. 'What we want is accountability, we want somebody to be arrested, we want somebody to go to jail, of course,' Fulton said. 'But ... we have grand juries and special grand juries; they're making a decision to not even arrest a person.' 'Of course we were devastated by the decision not to charge the murderer of our son,' said Trayvon’s father Tracy Martin at a news conference on Wednesday. CBS reports that Martin and Fulton have flown around the country to speak to media, youth groups, and lead rallies against racial profiling and gun violence. 'Just the work we’re doing with the foundation is helping us heal. This is our life. This is our purpose in life,' said Fulton. 'I will continue to fight for my son. I will continue to fight for your sons. Our work has not stopped, this is not halting us. This is going to make us push even harder because we have a lot of work to do,' she added.","Trayvon Martin's mom Sybrina Fulton says she still believes George Zimmerman got away with murder .

"House Speaker John Boehner accused Democrats in the Senate on Thursday of using funding for the Homeland Security Department as 'blackmail' as they attempt to protect President Barack Obama's immigration measures. Boehner's comments came after Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said at a press conference that House Republicans would be guaranteeing a shut down of the department when Saturday rolls around if they continue down the path that they're on. 'If they send over a bill with all the riders in it, they’ve shut down the government. We’re not going to play games,' Reid said during a joint press conference this morning with his counterpart in the lower chamber, Nancy Pelosi. Scroll down for video . 'Outrageous': House Speaker John Boehner accused Senate Democrats on Thursday of 'using Homeland Security funding for blackmail to protect the actions of the president' Boehner's tough talk came after House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, left, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, right, said at a news conference that Republicans in the House would be to blame if the Department of Homeland Security goes into shutdown mode tomorrow night because on the fight on Capitol Hill . Sparks flew on Capitol Hill on Thursday as the deadline to appropriate money to DHS rapidly approached. The White House, however, seemed confident that the situation would resolve itself in a timely manner, and the president's spokesman told reporters on Thursday that Obama had no immediate plans to get involved in the fight, which he characterized as 'a party dispute,' not a partisan one. Senate Democrats ended their filibuster on Wednesday of legislation to fund DHS after GOP leaders agreed to hold a separate vote on Obama's immigration directives. Members are expected to pass a bill before they go home for the week that would keep the Homeland Security up and running through the end of the fiscal year. They will take a separate vote to block the president's programs at a later date. Boehner would not say on Thursday whether he would bring the 'clean' bill that is free of language restricting the department from using its funds to implement Obama's directives to the floor of the House once it passes in the Senate. 'We’re waiting to see what the Senate can or can’t do, and then we’ll make decisions about how we’re going to proceed,' he said at a briefing. 'I just think it’s outrageous that Senate Democrats are using Homeland Security funding for blackmail to protect the actions of the president, where the president himself said he didn’t have the authority to do this,' Boehner said. The GOP leader rejected the White House's repeated claims that the DHS dispute is a fight ‘amongst Republicans.’ 'It is not a fight amongst Republicans. All Republicans agree that we want to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and we want to stop the president’s executive actions with regard to immigration,' he contended. He then stuck out at the president for sitting 'there like a bump on a log watching Senate Democrats filibuster the debate on this bill.' 'If they send over a bill with all the riders in it, they’ve shut down the government. We’re not going to play games,' Reid said. The Nevada Democrat is sporting glasses this week as his right eye recovers from surgery . Pelosi showed at the press conference on Thursday with sunglasses to show her solidarity with her Senate counterpart, who has been unable to see out of his right eye since New Year's Day when he injured himself while exercizing . The White House confirmed on Thursday that the president has not inserted himself directly into the argument in Congress, even as time runs out to come to an agreement, because he is hopeful Boehner to follow the 'responsible course' of action. 'I think that everybody expects' once the DHS funding bill comes up for a vote, it will get bipartisan support in the Senate and in the House, Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said. The real question, he said, is whether Boehner will allow that to happen. 'If its necessary for the president to speak to him directly about how important it is to fund the Department of Homeland Security, he'll have that conversation,' Earnest said, but 'I would anticipate that the speaker of the house understands the stakes...of this action.' The White House Press Secretary's cool tone toward the situation appeared to be an about-face from earlier in the week when the administration was on the verge of making doomsday warnings about the consequences of withholding money from the department responsible for protecting Americans from terrorists. Department of Homeland Security Chief Jeh Johnson held two news conference urging lawmakers to come to their senses and made the rounds on Capitol Hill in person on Thursday to confront them directly. Obama claimed Monday that withholding the funds would have 'direct impact' on national security. Wednesday, at a town hall on immigration hosted by MSNBC and Telemundo, the president said Republicans were 'trying to hold hostage' DHS's money 'which is so important for our national security.' More nonchalant about the matter than his boss had been the night before, Earnest still maintained on Thursday that a shutdown would 'would have negative consequences for the country' and that furloughing thousands of DHS workers 'can't be good for our homeland security.' According to one estimate, 30,000 of the department's employees would be kept off the job on the funding battle concluded. That would leave as many as 200,000 workers on the clock, but they would not be paid until Congress agreed on terms to fund DHS.","Senate Dems ended their filibuster of legislation to fund DHS after GOP leaders agreed to hold a separate vote on Obama's immigration directives .

"YouTube is not making any money despite having more than a billion viewers. The online TV website is ‘roughly breaking even’ nine years after Google bought it for $1.7billion (£1.1billion). Analysts said that there was ‘a lot of junk’ on YouTube and that the large number of young users did not buy anything from the adverts. Another issue is that YouTube takes up a vast infrastructure which wipes out the $3.8billion (£2.5billion) revenue that it brings in each year. YouTube spends $3.8billion on its infrastructure each year, but it's not making much profit. It is 'roughly breaking even' nine years after it was purchased by Google .

The Wall Street Journal report highlights how hard it is to make money from the Internet even if you are one of the biggest websites in the world. But some have cracked it and Netflix, the online TV and film service, reported a profit of $81million (£53million) in just the last quarter of 2014. Statistics show that by many standards YouTube is a huge success - the video for pop hit Gangam Style has been seen more than two billion times. However YouTube now under threat from other online streaming services such as Amazon, and the rise of quality TV shows from producers like HBO. The official YouTube video for Gangnam Style by Psy has been viewed more than two billion times. It is the most-watched YouTube video to date . Google is also having trouble attracting users directly to YouTube and most people access it through a link or an embedded video on another site. Instead Google wants people to turn on YouTube the way the turn on their TV. The tech giant is now experimenting with targeted adverts which mean you see commercials for products that you have already searched for. In the US YouTube has also bought the rights to American Football games and is also screening new episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine.

"A former police officer and his lover plotted to conceive a baby so they could abuse it and share it with other paedophiles, a court heard. Alexander McCracken, 35, shared fantasies of raping and murdering newborn babies with his then-girlfriend Sharon Campbell and said he would 'deffo rape a little baby girl'. Police found more than 500 hardcore child porn and bestiality images when they raided his home in Ayr, many of which were passed on to other paedophiles. The pair are now facing jail after admitting three charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children at Ayr Sheriff Court. Former police officer Alexander McCracken, 35, (pictured) shared fantasies of raping and murdering newborn babies said he would 'deffo rape a little baby girl' McCracken, who has a 10-year-old son, spent nine years with Strathclyde Police before being exposed in 2010 as a swinger and a £400-a-night bisexual prostitute, the Daily Record reported. Police seized his computer and smartphone in last year's raid and found a string of sickening messages including one which suggests they breed a 'baby toy' and abuse it 'as soon as born'. One, from a user linked to McCracken's computer, says: 'Oh would deffo rape a little baby girl.' When asked if his girlfriend would let him, the reply was: 'It's the wife typing lol. I would help him lol.' The usernames 'sleazyperv79' and 'NepicoupleUK' were linked to the computer and mobile used by McCracken. During one exchange, 'sleazyperv79' wrote: 'Three month old getting molesting … I hope he snuffed her eventually.' John Bradford, prosecuting, said: 'The chat indicates that the user has a predilection to violently sexually abuse these infants to death, or allow others do do so. He exchanged sickening messages with his former girlfriend Sharon Campbell and they are both now facing jail . The pair are  facing jail after admitting three charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children at Ayr Sheriff Court (pictured) 'The communications include content of a paedophilic nature, comments on the rape and killing of newborn babies and what purports to be a couple trying for a baby so that they can sexually abuse her.' He revealed that cybercrime experts found 551 such images in Yahoo Messenger chat files after the raid in January last year. The majority of the images were category five, the most depraved possible and most were passed among paedophiles between July 2012 and October 2013. Mr  Bradford said: 'The images are predominantly of young girls, with the majority being newborn, babies and toddlers with a few up to about the age of eight.' Police were alerted to the couple's actions by the National Online Child Abuse Protection service. Campbell, 39, who was a support worker for elderly people with mental health problems at a care home in Ayr, is no longer with McCracken. Her lawyer, Peter Lockhart, said: 'This is a frankly shocking and appalling offence and she recognises that. She has co-operated fully throughout and there is no getting away from it that a custodial sentence must be uppermost in your mind.' McCracken's lawyer Jill Malloy said he complied fully with strict bail conditions and had no unsupervised contact with females under 16 and no internet use where history could be hidden. She added that he had lost his job as a factory production worker. Sheriff Scott Pattison called for reports before sentencing next month. He said: 'These offences are of the utmost seriousness. You are fortunate you have been prosecuted in the sheriff court.' The usernames 'sleazyperv79' and 'NepicoupleUK' were linked to the computer and mobile used by Alexander McCracken. Computer experts found apps including Internet Relay Chat, Yahoo Messenger and Gigatribe had been used. One message, from a user linked to McCracken's computer, says: 'Oh would deffo rape a little baby girl.' When asked if his girlfriend would let him, the reply was: 'It's the wife typing lol. I would help him lol.' Another message suggested they would breed a 'baby toy' now and abuse it 'as soon as born'. During an exchange, 'sleazyperv79' wrote: 'Three month old getting molesting … I hope he snuffed her eventually.'

"The Nevada desert is normally associated with enormous casinos and lavish hotels. But it could soon become a focal point of the motoring industry - as Tesla's $5billion Gigafactory takes shape. The huge project is part of co-founder and CEO Elon Musk's plans to drive down the cost of electric cars. In September, the South-African born entrepreneur announced that the site near Reno, Nevada, was the chosen location for the lithium-ion battery plant, which is expected to reduce the price of the Tesla Model 3 by $2,800. Growing: Tesla's $5billion Gigafactory - which will be able to produce 500,000 lithium-ion batteries every year - takes shape in the desert near Reno, Nevada. Once completed it will be between 5 and 6 million square feet - or the size of the Pentagon . Ambitious: The project is part of co-founder Elon Musk's plans to drive down the cost of electric cars. The South African-born entrepreneur has said the cheaper production that will come with the site will bring down the cost of the Tesla Model 3 by almost $3,000 . Site preparation began in July at an industrial park along U.S. Interstate 80 15 miles east of Sparks, a Reno suburb. Since then the building has grown and looks set to be ready by the time partial production begins in 2017. The aim is to produce enough batteries to power 500,000 vehicles a year when it is fully completed in 2020 and produce a power source that can also be installed in gadgets such as toys and drones. Production is currently based in Freemont, California, but the plant does not have the capacity to serve the company's future production needs. The facility is expected to bring 6,500 jobs to Nevada and $100 billion in economic benefits, according to CNBC. In return, the state offered Tesla up to $1.3 billion in tax breaks. Economic benefits have already started coming in with 700 construction jobs being created.  Projections also suggest the factory will lead to a surge in the local population - with an additional 35,000 residents moving to the area by 2032. It is set to be completed in 2020 and will be around 10 million square feet - as big as the Pentagon or 174 football fields. The venture is partnered by Panasonic, who are believed to have invested billions in the motor company. Even though Reno has attracted big businesses such as Apple and Amazon, there is concern the city's infrastructure will not be able to cope with the increase in demand. Nevada's governor Brian Sandoval said it's further proof the state, that has also landed huge Switch data center expansion, is emerging as a leader in new technology innovation. 'This announcement demonstrates the possibilities within our state if we continue to recruit the growing industries of the 21st century,' he said. Nevada overall is expected to add 528,000 people over the next two decades, for a population of 3.3 million. That's led by an estimated 328,000-person bump in Clark County and an estimated 147,000-person gain in Washoe County. But northern Nevada, where the gigafactory will be built, is expected to feel the most direct impact from Tesla. Location: An image taken from the hills surrounding the complex reveal its isolation and scale . Development: Construction has moved along at a rapid rate since November (pictured). The project is set to last for another five years but partial production is set to begin in 2017 . Future: An artist's impression shows what the site could look like when it is finished in 2020. Nevada will also benefit from an investment in roads leading to the facility and potential to surround it with other ventures .

"Just weeks after surviving a potential leadership spill, it appears Prime Minister Tony Abbott might have to prepare himself for round two. Backbenchers have reportedly informed Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull that he's got the numbers for a successful spill motion to take the top job, according to Seven News. But they've said the move would have to be initiated by senior Liberal ministers. It is believed Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop is against another spill motion but will stand against Mr Turnbull if it goes ahead. Others tried to downplay the claims by saying a second attempt at a leadership spill would be 'madness', the Daily Telegraph reports. This comes as Mr Abbott publicly flayed Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs after the commission released a report examining the conditions of children held in detention. Mr Turnbull then refused to echo the Prime Minister's attacks on Prof Triggs, heaping praise on her instead. An increasing number of MPs have told Malcolm Turnbull (right) on Thursday he has the figures to beat Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) in a leadership spill . Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop (right) is reportedly against another spill motion but will stand against Mr Turnbull (left) if it goes ahead . An increasing number of MPs told Mr Turnbull on Thursday he has the figures to beat Mr Abbott in a leadership challenge but the move would have to come from the Cabinet. 'We've done our bit ... it's now the Cabinet's turn,' one MP told Seven News. 'The temperature has increased this week,' another said. Supporters of Ms Bishop also said the Foreign Affairs Minister won't be backing another spill and will stand against the Communications Minister if it is brought on, Seven News further reports. Other Liberal MPs have revealed that Mr Abbott's supporters said 'if he [the Prime Minister] doesn't turn things around by mid-year he will stand down'. However some, including coalition frontbencher Steve Ciobo, are denying any such talk of another leadership challenge. 'We had a vote of the party room in relation to a spill motion that has been decided, the Prime Minister continues on with the support of party room,' he told the ABC. Yet the claims were further reiterated as senior ministers told the Daily Telegraph Mr Abbott no longer has most of the support of his party room, while others tried to crush such reports by saying it was 'madness' to attempt a second spill less than three weeks after the first. Ms Bishop and Mr Turnbull walk behind Prime Minister Tony Abbott as they leave the chamber following the end of question time in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday . Mr Turnbull was widely touted as a potential candidate if a leadership spill motion went ahead earlier this month . The reports prompted voters to take to social media, some venting their frustration while others showing their excitement about the prospect of '#libspill2'. 'Why are we wasting more precious time on #libspill2 focus on the country?? focus on the issues.. forget about the next election,' Golfon5 tweeted.

"Former federal parliamentary speaker Peter Slipper has won his appeal against three convictions for dishonestly misusing taxpayer-funded taxi vouchers. ACT Supreme Court Judge Justice John Burns threw out the guilty charges and ordered the penalties given to Mr Slipper be set aside, in a court hearing Thursday morning. Mr Slipper had been convicted in September 2014, ordering him to serve 300 hours community service and repay $954 to the Commonwealth. Former federal parliamentary speaker Peter Slipper has won his appeal against three convictions for dishonestly misusing taxpayer-funded taxi vouchers. Mr Slipper was found guilty last year of three dishonesty charges for misusing his government Cabcharge allowance  to visit Canberra wineries throughout 2010. He also filled out multiple vouchers in an attempt to hide the trips. While he admitted to using government travel entitlements to visit vineyards outside Canberra in 2010, Mr Slipper always denied he acted dishonestly. A Canberra court threw out the conviction against Mr Slipper, which was handed down in 2014. The former speaker admitted to using the Cabcharge vouchers, but has always denied he acted dishonestly. Mr Slipper's lawyers told the court the original magistrate who found him guilty failed to consider other possibilities, including that he had simply made a mistake. His lawyers also said it had not been proven that Mr Slipper was not on parliamentary business. Mr Slipper lodged his appeal in December, and had argued he should have simply been allowed to repay the money. The former speaker was forced to resign from the position in 2012, after former staffer James Ashby brought sexual harassment claims against him. Mr Ashby recently abandoned his claim against Mr Slipper after a two-year court battle. He had alleged Mr Slipper sexual harassed him over a period of months, when he worked as a media adviser in the then-Speaker's office.","Slipper successful appeals 3 charges of dishonestly using taxpayer funds .

"A majority of U.S. Supreme . Court justices have signaled support for a Muslim woman . who was denied a job at an Abercrombie . & Fitch because she wore a . head scarf. On Wednesday, the nine justices heard a one-hour argument in an appeal . brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . (EEOC) on behalf of Samantha Elauf. Elauf, who was denied a sales job at an . Abercrombie Kids store in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2008 when she was 17, attended the Supreme Court in Washington for the hearing with her mother. It appeared the court's four liberal justices are likely to vote in Elauf's favor, while at least one of the court's conservatives, Justice Samuel Alito, seems set to follow suit. A ruling is due by the end of June. Scroll down for video . Fight: Samantha Elauf stands outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday after U.S. Justices heard how she was denied a job because of her headscarf. The justices appeared to side with her . Taking a stand: Elauf leaves the court with her mother, Majda Elauf, and P. David Lopez, General Counsel of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, who brought the lawsuit on her behalf . The legal question is whether Elauf was required to ask the company to accommodate her religious practice. Abercrombie & Fitch said she did not ask them to change their policy and so they cannot be sued . under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The company said it has previously granted religious accommodations when they have requested. Elauf was wearing a head scarf, or hijab, at her job . interview in 2008 but did not specifically say that, as a Muslim, she . wanted the company to give her a religious accommodation. But the assistant manager who interviewed her assumed she was wearing it for religious reasons. She was impressed by Elauf but when she consulted a manager, they did not give her the job. The company denied Elauf the job on the grounds that wearing . the scarf violated its 'look policy' for members of the sales . staff, a policy intended to promote the brand's East Coast . collegiate image. 'Discrimination': Elauf, who now works for Urban Outfitters, failed to get a job at an Abercrombie & Fitch store in Oklahoma in 2008, when she was 17, because her headscarf conflicted with their 'look policy' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the civil rights law requires certain peopleto be treated differently to other applicants if they have areligious requirement. 'They don't have to accommodate a baseball cap. They do have . to accommodate a yarmulke,' Ginsburg said, in a reference to the . cap worn by some Jewish men. Justice Samuel Alito said employers like Abercrombie could easily find out . if prospective employees need a religious accommodation by . simply asking if they are able to abide by work rules. He noted that Abercrombie had assumed Elauf would wear the . head scarf every day simply because she wore it at the . interview. 'Maybe she just had a bad hair day,' Alito said. Other conservative justices were more skeptical about the . government's arguments. Chief Justice John Roberts speculated that putting the . burden on the employee to assess whether a religious . accommodation is needed 'may promote stereotypes to a far . greater degree' by requiring interviewers to inquire about . applicants' religious beliefs. Fighting back: But the company says Elauf did not ask for a religious accommodation to wear the scarf . Support: Demonstrators gather outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday to give Elauf their support . Muslim groups said in a friend-of-the-court brief in supportof Elauf that employment discrimination against Muslims iswidespread in the United States. Often, the act of a woman . wearing a head scarf is what triggers the discrimination, the brief said. The EEOC has reported that Muslims file . more employment claims about discrimination and the failure to . provide religious accommodations than any other religious group. Groups representing Christians, Jews and Sikhs also filed . court papers backing Elauf. The case comes before the top U.S. court at a time when some Western nations are struggling with culture clashes relating to accommodating local Islamic populations. The United States has not, however, faced the same tensions as some European countries including France. Abercrombie has faced other employee lawsuits, including one . in which it agreed in 2004 to pay $40 million to several . thousand minority and female plaintiffs who had accused the . company of discrimination. The right look: Abercrombie & Fitch is famously strict with the staff it hires and calls them 'models' Samantha Elauf was applying for a job at an Abercrombie kids store as a 'model' - the term the company uses for its sales staff. In 2013, Buzzfeed obtained copies of the company's lengthy 'Look Policy', which revealed Abercrombie & Fitch's 'hyper-specific, borderline absurd dress code', the website reported. The policy is intended to promote the brand's East Coast collegiate image. 'While we respect your individuality, it is important that we maintain a consistent level of dress and grooming that represents what people expect from the Abercrombie & Fitch brand,' it read. Snippets from the manual showed diagrams of hairstyles, explaining that the company allowed 'sunkissed/subtle highlighting with complementary shading', but it would not accept 'two-tone color' hair or 'chunks of contrasting color'. Strict: One snippet from the August 2013 policy, obtained by Buzzfeed, shows the rules for hair color . 'All hairstyles for men and women should appear neat, clean, natural, kempt and classic,' the manual reads. 'No associate is permitted to wear any extreme hair styles or hair color. Hair styles and hair color should reflect your natural beauty.' Facial hair is banned, men are not allowed to wear earrings, makeup must also look 'natural' and any colored nail polish is 'unacceptable', according to the guidelines. Visible tattoos are only allowed if they suit the Abercrombie brand and if they are approved by a supervisor. 'Fingernails should not extend more than 1/4 inch beyond the tip of the finger,' the handbook adds. Rules: The handbook shows that facial hair is 'unacceptable' and that fingernails must be worn short . While headwear is not allowed, the look policy does say that exemptions can be made for religious and disability reasons, Buzzfeed notes. If an applicant or employee asks for an exception based on these reasons, human resources must be contacted immediately, the handbook says. As for clothes, employees are encouraged to look smart while displaying their individual style. 'Clothing should also be consistent with the season (e.g. a heavy wool turtleneck sweater should not be worn in 90 degree heat),' the manual added. 'Clothing choices should be clean and classic, not provocative (e.g. tanks should be worn with an undergarment).' The handbook says that if employees fail to follow the guidelines, they could be fired. No discrimination: The handbook also points out that it does allow head coverings for religious reasons .","Samantha Elauf arrived for an interview for a 'model' position at an Abercrombie store in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2008 wearing a black headscarf .

"A man who was caught stealing women's underwear after by breaking into homes and raiding tumble driers has been jailed. Christopher McHarg was filmed sneaking into a garage on several occasions to steal pink and white ladies bras and bottoms. The 28-year-old from Monkton, Ayrshire, was jailed after the family installed a secret camera when they noticed their undergarments going missing. Christopher McHarg was filmed stealing women's underwear and clothes from a tumble drier after breaking in to his victim's garage a number of times over several weeks last year . After being reported to police officers found around 100 items of clothing at McHarg's home that he had stolen from the drier. Footage taken on the camera show him breaking in to the garage in the middle of the night, using the light on his phone as a torch to select items of underwear. He was handed a community payback order at Ayr Sheriff Court and told to complete 200 hours of unpaid community service after admitting to stealing the underwear between July and November last year. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register for two years. Speaking after the sentencing a source close to the family said: 'They were getting increasingly puzzled as to where all this underwear was disappearing to and set up their own camera. 'It recorded hours and hours of footage and they would occasionally check it. 'But to their astonishment they saw a person creeping around their property and recognised it was McHarg. 'He can be seen carefully choosing what items he wants to keep and then puts the rest back. It’s disturbing and really creepy to see. 'The family are glad it’s all over but feel he should have been given a tougher sentence.' Sheriff Scott Pattison rejected the claim McHarg had no sexual motivation, telling the court: 'He says there was no fixation but it went on for six months. McHarg told the court he did not know why he had broken in to steal the underwear. He was caught when his victims installed a hidden camera after so much of their wardrobes went missing . His victims said they were disappointed with McHarg's sentence and were shocked to learn it had been him stealing their clothes . The 28-year-old was put on the sex offenders' register and told to complete 200 hours of unpaid work . 'The offence and persistency of it is very concerning indeed. 'I’m certifying the offence as having a sexual aspect.' However defending counsel Gregor Forbes said the 28-year-old had been drinking every time he decided to raid the tumble drier. 'It wasn’t particularly well thought out - using a mobile phone as a torch. 'He made seven visits to the house, removing clothes on five of them. 'His GP has referred him to a psychologist and it’s been a stressful time for him. 'He’s been signed off his work at a local supermarket.' Sheriff Scott Pattison said: 'He says there was no fixation but it went on for six months. 'The offence and persistency of it is very concerning indeed. 'I'm certifying the offence as having a sexual aspect.'","Christopher McHarg was filmed stealing underwear from tumble drier .

"Britain's cheeriest lollipop man has been banned from dancing and giving 'high fives' to schoolchildren. Council bosses have ordered Nkosana Mdikane, 74, to stay still so motorists can see him, despite his merry singing and dancing brightening the mornings of hundreds of pupils and parents. Mr Mdikane was previously hailed by West Dunbartonshire Council for his 'excellent service' outside Aitkenbar Primary School in Dumbarton. Scroll down for video . Britain's cheeriest lollipop man Nkosana Mdikane has been banned from dancing and giving high fives to schoolchildren . Banned: Council bosses have ordered Mr Mdikane, 74, to stay still so motorists can see him . But now the local authority have told him that all lollipop men must 'remain static with one hand on their stick and the other stretched outwards'. Mr Mdikane, who has held the road safety job since 2013, said he respected his employer's decision but hoped the rules would be changed. 'The council is stopping me from high-fiving the kids while on duty,' he said. 'I never saw any problem in that. I'm just doing my job, but this is very emotional and affecting me. 'This issue was raised by the kids themselves. They said I can't give them any more high fives. They cannot take it and I don't like to see them upset. 'I'm respecting the decision and haven't done it since I found out. I've agreed to stop. Mr Mdikane was previously hailed by West Dunbartonshire Council for his 'excellent service' outside Aitkenbar Primary School in Dumbarton . The lollipop man has held the job helping children cross the road outside Aitkenbar Primary School (pictured) since 2013 . 'I have been doing this for about two years and all of a sudden I have to stop. They [the council] should revise their decision. They need to listen to the community.' Before moving to Scotland from Vereeniging, South Africa, in 2003, Mr Mdikane worked as a delivery driver and a chauffeur. He and his wife Zoli, 73, a former nurse, were looking forward to retirement, but when his neighbour told him a position as lollipop man was available, he jumped at the opportunity. He said: 'This job is exciting. It's the best job I've ever had. 'It has taken away the frustration and loneliness of being retired. I can't be watching TV - that is too dull.' The decision by the council, which previously praised the lollipop man for his 'cheery nature', has enraged parents, who have launched a campaign page on Facebook and have started a petition to bring back Mr Mdikane's dancing. The council say that all lollipop men must 'remain static with one hand on their stick and the other stretched outwards' Mr Mdikane, who has held the road safety job since 2013, said he respected his employer's decision but hoped the rules would be changed . Campaigner and father-of-three David Dufton, 36, said: 'It's a shame. It's a surprising U-turn. One minute they're saying they love him, he's a great guy and the next they're telling him he can't behave this way. 'He's a 74-year-old man and he's out there in all weathers. It's a bit unjust. I've never heard any one ever complain about him. 'I think they have let him down a little bit. We would like the council to revise their decision. In terms of health and safety we don't see a problem. He encourages people to cross at the crossing. 'Nkosana always puts a smile on people's faces. I hope we can return the favour and put a little smile on his face with our campaign.' A spokeswoman for the council said: 'All patrollers are instructed when crossing children over a road to remain static with one hand on their stick and the other stretched outwards. 'This ensures that they can be seen and effectively provides a barrier between school pupils and the traffic.'","Council boss bans lollipop man, 74, from dancing and giving 'high fives'

"Astonishing footage has surfaced of a vast sinkhole in Darwin being flooded with about 100 million litres of water in a matter of seconds. The time lapse vision, which took place over about five hours during a cyclone last Friday, shows the sinkhole being completely engulfed . The owner of the Darwin River property where the sinkhole is situated said it is still standing after a week, reports NT News. The huge sinkhole, which was formed in July,was filmed during a heavy storm last Friday . In a matter of seconds, the timelapse video shows the sinkhole being completely flooded in a matter of seconds . Lance Hart, who named the sinkhole Lake WTF, said his family regularly mount a camera onto a tree to document changes from the rain. He prepared the camera last Friday after news that heavy storms were due. Between 4am and 9am, the crater was filled. 'It's like the whole thing filled up in around five hours,' he told NT News. Mr Lance said he believes there is currently around 75-100 million litres of water sitting in the sinkhole. He said he expects the hole, which was formed in July, to have transformed from the influx of rainwater. 'I'm expecting it to have changed,' he said. Lance Hart, who named the sinkhole Lake WTF, said his family regularly mount a camera onto a tree to document changes from the rain . He prepared the camera last Friday after news that heavy storms were due between 4am and 9am . Mr Lance first discovered the huge sinkhole, which had opened up just metres from his home late , after he heard the sound of the earth collapsing in on itself. Darwin River resident Lance Hart told Nine News he was alerted to the hole when he heard a 'rumbling kind of like distant thunder'. 'Can't be thunder, it's dry season,' Mr Hart said, before he revealed that when he ventured out into his backyard a few days later he realised something was wrong when he came across a large crack in the earth. Darwin river man Lance Hart was amazed when he discovered a gaping sinkhole just metres from his home . Though it's not the first of its kind in the area, this sinkhole is the biggest locals have ever seen. Mr Hart likened it to the famous scene from Crocodile Dundee where Paul Hogan's character bragged, 'that's not a knife, this is a knife', and laughed that he now had the biggest sinkhole. In a video posted to YouTube Mr Hart walked less than 50 metres from the back of his home and stood at edge of the gaping hole, which swallowed trees and boulders. Mr Hart told Nine News he watched enourmous boulders swallowed by the water at the bottom of the hole . His footage shows the sheer size of the sinkhole, estimated to be 40 metres wide and drop down 15 metres to the point where it's filled with water. 'That, is a big hole,' Mr Hart narrated. 'I have no idea how deep that water is, but from the rocks that are still falling in to it... We're seeing massive boulders slide down and disappear underneath the surface so it's obviously very deep,' he continued. Trees as tall as 20 metres which once stood tall where the hole now lies are nowhere to be seen, and experts are unsure whether the gap will continue to expand. Before he reached the hole, Mr Hart found a long fissure in the earth . The sinkhole absorbed everything around it and experts are unsure whether it will continue to expand . Neighbour Daniel Cocks told the program he was extremely grateful the gap didn't appear on his property, where he keeps his collection of 24 old Land Rovers. 'They're 30, 40 year old Land Rovers, I've got 24 of them... I don't really want to lose them, not in a great big hole,' Mr Cocks laughed. At the end of the YouTube video, Mr Hart summed up his new backyard feature in one word: 'Amazing.'","The vision was taken during a heavy storm last Friday at Darwin River .

"Mary Helen Rowell clearly doesn't have claustrophobia because her 90-square-foot apartment in Manhattan is enough to make anyone afraid of closed spaces ill. The young fashion worker gave Curbed a 'tour' of her apartment to show how she has sacrificed on space to live in the upscale West Village neighborhood, where she can count Courtney Love, Brooke Shields and Calvin Klein as neighbors. And at just $775 a month in rent - it's a steal by New York standards, where the median rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in her neighborhood is $3,200. These pictures, and more on Curbed's site, show just how well Rowell has adapted the space. Scroll down for video . A new kind of micro-apartment: New York fashion industry worker Mary Helen Rowell calls this 90-square-foot apartment in the West Village home . Ritz: Rowell lives in the same upscale New York neighborhood as celebrities such as Courtney Love, Calvin Klein and Julianne Moore . Rowell told the site that she first found out about the apartment through NYU's housing listserv. While other students scoffed at the comically small space, Rowell saw it as an opportunity to streamline her life. 'I really like getting rid of things,'  Rowell told Curbed. 'It's my favorite thing.' It wasn't until she started taking measurements for the apartment that she realized the unique design challenges she was going to face. Walk-in closet... of sorts: Rowell has artfully constructed a closet using rails that stick out the wall . Doubling up: The sink is used for cooking but also to clean clothes . Steal: The small space costs just $750 a month - which is extremely low compared to the $3,200 median rent for the neighborhood . Neat and tidy: Clever storage solutions help keep Rowell's shoebox orderly, including a pole that hands her kitchen utensils and folding bistro chairs that can be hung up on the wall when not in use . Close quarters: One of the downsides is the fact that Rowell has to share a bathroom with one of the two other tenants in the building . At just 78-inches wide, the apartment photographed for Curbed by Max Touhey is smaller than a standard bed frame. When her initial plans to build a pull-down Murphy bed fell apart, she was forced to build a custom bed-frame which she tricked out with added storage space underneath. Prior to moving into the West Village apartment, Rowell lived with roommates. Her bedroom has always been small but she had gotten used to having access to a full kitchen a living room. In her new apartment, there just isn't the space. For a kitchen, Rowell has a sink and a sliver of counter space where she can cook on a hot pot. On shelves above that she keeps a toaster oven, microwave, and more storage boxes. Rowell says she has been able to feed herself fine in the kitchen, using it to make such elaborate meals as pork chops and baked eggs. While she has to use the sink for both cooking and washing up. The entire building has just three units and only one is a true one bedroom with a bathroom. Rowell and another tenant share a bathroom located just across the hall. Perhaps the biggest issue in the apartment for Rowell is lack of a closet, since her job in the fashion industry means she has a well-stocked wardrobe.

"Dr. Ben Carson grabbed the Democratic Party's third rail with both hands Thursday morning, launching a political attack based on his complaint that liberals are 'making people dependent' in majority-black American inner-cities. Race politics have been the near-exclusive domain of the Democrats since the civil-rights era of the 1960s, and Barack Obama's successful White House bid in 2008 solidified their position. But Carson – the most prominent black Republican in the 2016 presidential picture – told the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C. on Thursday that the Democrats now see African-Americans' support as an entitlement – choosing to 'keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.' Scroll down for video . 'SUPPRESSED!': Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson told conservatives near the nation's capitol on Thursday that Democrats are keeping black Americans dependent on government, and he's the man to fix it . CROSSING RACIAL LINES: Almost all of Carson's loud supporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference are white – a sight reminiscent of Barack Obama's rise to national prominence in 2008 . WHERE'S BEN? Carson is an outsider and didn't make the cut when this CPAC vendor made candidate cutouts to sell . Scores of supporters chanting 'Run, Ben Run!' – almost exclusively white Americans – arrived with him. Matthew Brown, a New York college student attending the conference, told Daily Mail Online that Carson is just hitting his stride. 'He's shaking people up and freaking people out,' Brown said. 'The days of a lily-white GOP are starting to fade, and the only people who seem to oppose this energetic and thoughtful black guy are teh Democrats. That should tell you something.' Carson, who led off the conference, couched his talk of a presidential run and committed to little, outlining his positions 'if I were to run – you have to say those things.' He addressed Obamacare, school choice issues, America's chronically out-of-balance federal budget, the ISIS terror army, Iran and the tax code: 'Get rid of the IRS,' he urged. William Temple of the Golden Isles Tea Party in Georgia, dressed as Button Gwinnett, the second signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, cheered Carson during teh CPAC conference . But Carson's moves are being watched carefully by Republicans who wonder if America's second black president could actually be one of them – a politician who attacks the welfare state and blames government for keeping blacks from succeeding. 'I think the key is to tell them the truth. No more of this hiding what's going on,' Carson said of his approach to dealing with African-Americans. 'We need to reach out to people who think that maybe being dependent is reasonable as long as they feel safe. And it isn't. It really is not compassionate to pat people on the head and say, ""There, there, you poor little thing, I'm going to take care of all your needs. Your health care, your food and your housing. Don't you worry about anything, it's just all those bad people who are causing you problems. I'm going to fix it"".' 'That's not compassion,' he said. That's the opposite of compassion. That's making people dependent.' The former Johns Hopkins University surgeon has taken flack – as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thoms did before him – for opposing race-based affirmative action and welfare policies that helped pull him out of poverty. He acknowledged Thursday that the complaint gets his attention. UNCONVENTIONAL: It's too soon to know whether Carson's conservative message will resonate with black voters . 'NO NANNY STATE NEEDED': Utah Republican Rep. Mia Love said black Americans like her 'will rise to the occasion on their own' 'I hear some people saying ... ""He benefited from welfare and all this stuff, and now he wants to get rid of it"",' Carson said, before insisting that 'I'm not interested in getting rid of the safety net. I'm interested in getting rid of dependency.' 'As more and more people hear that message they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.' Rep. Mia Love, who last year became the first black Republican woman elected to Congress, said Thursday during a panel discussion about millennial voters that she gets questions from detractors who say, '""I don't understand how you can be a black female from Utah, and a Republican. ... It makes no sense"".' It's 'because I refuse to fit this mold that society is telling me I have to fit into, she explained. Like Carson, she fed the crowd red meat in the form of a slap at the federal government's 'intrusions' into the lives of ordinary black Americans. They 'will rise to the occasion on their own,' Love said. 'No nanny-state needed.' And Democrats who run the government's executive branch, she said, 'don't want us to have the opportunity to rise to the occasion.'","Prominent black GOP presidential hopeful got aggressive at the Conservative Political Action Conference .
'If you're black and you oppose the progressive agenda, and you're pro-life, and you're pro-family, then they don't know what to call you'

Carson, a world-renowned retired pediatric neurosurgeon, hopes to follow Barack Obama with a right-wing black presidency ."
"A 'callous and contemptuous' paediatrician who ran an unregistered mobile circumcision service has been struck off after he carried out a string of bungled and unhygienic procedures - including one while a baby boy was screaming in agony because the anaesthetic had worn off. Dr Mohammed Siddiqui, 49, of Southampton, carried out four botched circumcisions on youngsters at their homes in Southampton, Bath, Birmingham and Reading for parents who wanted to have their children circumcised for religious reasons. But the NHS doctor failed to wear gloves or carry proper resuscitation equipment, leaving one baby suffering seizures and another in agony when he woke up during the circumcision and Siddiqui decided to carry on anyway. Mohammed Siddiqui has been struck off the medical register after he carried out botched and unhygienic circumcisions on baby boys in an unregistered mobile clinic, with a 'reckless disregard' for their safety . He has now been struck off the medical register. Siddiqui's 'mobile clinic' was not registered with the Care Quality Commission and the doctor failed to secure proper insurance for each procedure. He worked at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust at the time he was running the clinic for cash, as a sideline, between June 2012 and November 2013. He was suspended but carried on carrying out the procedures using a loophole in the law. He has since resigned from the NHS. Following a three-week hearing at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, 69 separate allegations against Dr Siddiqui were found proved and he was branded a risk to patients, having acted with a 'reckless disregard' for their safety. Siddiqui performed the procedures on four separate boys. The families said the medic did not wash his hands prior to the procedures treatment, did not wear surgical gloves, failed to carry out proper examinations and did not have proper resuscitation equipment including oxygen and airway equipment. He even carried surgical materials in plastic carrier bags and used baby wipes during the procedures. Siddiqui was working at Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust and running the service as a sideline . An investigation began after a complaint by Kelly Braiha and her husband Ghali, from Littlehampton in West Sussex, which claimed their 23-month-old son Najem was left traumatised and suffered an infection because Siddiqui did not take hygienic precautions. When one boy suffered an adverse reaction to a local anaesthetic, Siddiqui did not realise it was a seizure and failed to act immediately to ensure an ambulance was called. Instead, when the boy's eyes started rolling back in his head and he began frothing at the mouth, Siddiqui thought the boy was cold and asked the baby's father to wrap him in a blanket and turn the central heating up. The baby was later taken to hospital where suffered two further seizures. When the parent of a second boy rang the medic to say his son was still in pain, Siddiqui failed to respond and in an email accused him of 'telling lies'. A third boy - whose parents are themselves both doctors - woke up during the procedure and began screaming in agony but Siddiqui saw 'no point in waiting any longer'. Siddiqui is pictured leaving the GMC hearing in Manchester . The hearing was told he kept saying: 'I didn't need to stop because the child was already crying.' An operation on a further youngster was such a poor standard he had to carry out another circumcision on the same child the following day. The boy suffered injuries from the operation because too much skin was removed, Siddiqui failed to refer him to a hospital and then ignored his parents when they expressed concerns over his condition, the tribunal had heard. Circumcision is only available through the NHS if there are compelling medical reasons but healthcare workers still have to be registered with the Care Quality Commission if they want to perform home circumcisions for religious reasons. However it is feared Siddiqui - despite being struck off - could try to continue to operate his dangerous private mobile clinic because male circumcision is not illegal in Britain. The practice is popular among the Muslim community. Panel Chairman John Donnelly said Dr Siddiqui had been 'evasive and contradictory' during his evidence and said the medic had treated the GMC with 'contempt.' He added: 'His misconduct was both a particularly serious departure and reckless disregard of good medical practise and patient safety. Some of his behaviour as previously identified, involved breaches of very basic mandatory medical principles.' Mr Donnelly said Siddiqui had put one baby's life at risk by failing to deal with the situation properly when a baby suffered a seizure and had caused considerable pain by continuing with the circumcision when one baby woke up crying. The chairman added: 'He seemed completely indifferent to the fact he had caused pain to this baby and actually said that when babies were already crying he established the effectiveness of the local anaesthetic by beginning the procedure and seeing the reaction. Siddiqui also failed to obtain adequate histories of each boy he was performed the procedure, it was said, as well as failing to make sure his equipment was aseptic. Siddiqui did not wash his hands properly before procedures and continued to carry out a circumcision on a young boy who woke up screaming in agony during surgery because the anaesthetic had worn off . Mr Donnelly added 'Mr Siddiqui said he is an experienced, hospital-based paediatric surgeon, yet he made a number of failures in basic hygiene in preparing babies for the circumcision and in preparing himself to perform them. Taken together they amounted to serious failures that must have increased the risk of infection to the very young children upon whom he was operating. 'Given his experience he must have known that the level of hygiene he was applying fell far below the standard expected of a medical practitioner carrying out a surgical procedure in the home and was wrong.' The Panel said it was also concerned that Siddiqui's attitude showed a significant lack of concern for the wellbeing of the babies and their parents. It found the only option was for 'erasure', or striking off, from the register. Mr Donnelly said: “The Panel has concluded that Mr Siddiqui’s behaviour is fundamentally incompatible with continued registration. It is satisfied that erasure is necessary in order to protect the public, to uphold professional standards and to maintain confidence in the profession. The panel also found he often showed an arrogance and was reluctant to take advice from senior doctors.","Dr Mohammed Siddiqui was NHS paediatrician at Southampton Hospital .

Queen Letizia attended the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair in Madrid today . The Spanish queen looked chic and colour co-ordinated in a shift dress, black leather clutch and suede shoes . The 42-year-old kept her accessories simple with discreet silver earrings and a black quilted leather clutch, while her dress was decorated with simple evenly-spaced studs. Ever keen to colour co-ordinate, the 42-year-old wore soft blue suede high heel court shoes . King Felipe VI kept his look simple with his trademark grey suit with a subtle white check and a blue tie with a swirling paisley pattern. The royals admired huge sculptures, including an untitled art work consisting of a  bronze swirl of metal extending out of a matte metal dome, alongside the nation's education, culture and sports minister Ignacio Wert and the Mayor of Madrid, Ana Botella. The event will run until 1 March, and features work by Colombian artists this year.

"The superbug Clostridium difficile has been linked to the deaths of 29,000 Americans a year, according to a new report. The study found there were nearly twice as many deaths associated with the bacteria than had previously been recorded. In the majority of cases researchers also found an infection by the deadly bug was due to the overuse of antibiotics. This image shows a cluster of Clostridium difficile bacteria that is linked to 29,000 deaths a year in America . In total c.difficle infects 450,000 Americans each year the report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, according to NBC News. The bacteria causes an inflammation of the colon and causes deadly diarrhea. The research found the deadly microbe was 'directly attributed' to 15,000 deaths and linked to 29,000 deaths in 2011. More than 80 percent of the deaths associated with the infection occurred among Americans aged 65 years or older. 'C difficle infections cause immense suffering and death for thousands of Americans each year,' said CDC Director Tom Frieden. 'These infections can be prevented by improving antibiotic prescribing and by improving infection control in the health care system. 'CDC hopes to ramp up prevention of this deadly infection by supporting State Antibiotic Resistance Prevention Programs in all 50 states.' A medical illustration of Clostridium difficile bacterium that sickens nearly twice as many Americans each year as was previously thought, according to a study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Studies have shown that between 30 and 50 per cent of antibiotics prescribed in hospital are unnecessary and incorrect. This can increase the spread of the bacteria, which can be picked up from contaminated surfaces or spread from person to person. The new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, cast a wider net than earlier research, which focused more on illnesses that happened in hospitals. It used information from laboratories in selected counties in 10 states. It found two-thirds of C-difficle cases occur in hospitals or nursing homes or in recently discharged patients. The other third were mostly people out in the community who got sick and saw a doctor. However the CDC has documented a 10 percent decrease in hospital-onset C. difficile infections between 2011 and 2013. Fighting the infections costs hospitals $4.8 billion each year, according to the CDC.","C. difficile linked to deaths of 29,000 deaths of Americans each year .

"Damning: A report will claim more than 50 victims, one as young as eight, were abused by Jimmy Savile (pictured) at Stoke Mandeville alone . Jimmy Savile abused an eight-year-old girl when she had 144 stitches across the lower part of her body as a result of surgery for cancer, it was revealed last night. The victim, now in her 40s, said that when she raised her complaint with a ward sister at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, she was met with the response: ‘Be quiet, you silly girl. Do you realise how much he has done for the hospital?’ Horrific details of her case emerged ahead of damning report out today that will reveal the hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, received ten complaints about Savile, but victims’ statements were ignored. The woman said the abuse had ‘shaped’ her life. She added: ‘I went into hospital an innocent young girl and I left damaged. ‘I wish that I had possessed the strength back then to pursue him properly. I want to see some accountability from the report into Stoke Mandeville. No one has properly said sorry. 'We must make sure this can never, ever happen again to anyone else in an institution. No more lives must be ruined.’ Today, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will apologise to dozens of hospital patients amid new revelations about the extent of abuse, described as ‘horrific’. An official report will publish allegations that Savile assaulted and raped at least 44 victims at Stoke Mandeville. One of the abuse complaints reached a hospital manager, after the victim had already told a nurse and a ward manager. Nine reports were made to nurses alone, the report is believed to say. Abuse: Savile, former Radio 1 DJ and television personality, pictured at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1989 . Shocking: A damning report out today will reveal the hospital (above) in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, received ten complaints about Savile, but victims' statements were ignored . More than 50 victims were abused by Savile at Stoke Mandeville alone. Those affected included patients, staff and visitors. The Stoke Mandeville inquiry was led by independent investigator Dr Androulla Johnstone and overseen by a local oversight panel led by the hospital trust’s non-executive director, Keith Gilchrist. Figures showing David Cameron has spectacularly failed to meet his promise to cut immigration will today be ‘buried’ under a slew of reports about the Jimmy Savile scandal. Ministers were last night accused of ‘cynically’ timing the release of the Savile investigations by two Government departments to coincide with the migration statistics. Both will be released at 9.30am – with reports into Savile’s paedophile abuse in at least 12 NHS hospitals and 21 children’s homes and schools certain to get blanket coverage. The migration statistics will be released without fanfare by the independent Office for National Statistics. They are expected to show net migration has risen again, to more than 260,000. Whitehall officials and MPs are convinced the date has been chosen deliberately. Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: ‘Thursday, it is clear, is, for this Government, a good day to bury bad news.’ Savile, the former Radio 1 DJ and television personality, began volunteering as a porter at Stoke Mandeville in the 1970s and helped to raise £40million for its spinal injuries centre. He had free use of a flat and office on the hospital site. The report will also say Savile’s reputation as a ‘sex pest’ was an open secret. Staff described him as ‘creepy’ and ‘a lecher’ who had access to the mortuary alone, out of hours. Stoke Mandeville’s former director of nursing, Chris McFarlane, said reports of abuse by Savile ‘never reached senior management ears’. She added: ‘Jimmy had 100 per cent access to the hospital, to all parts.’ Liz Dux, a solicitor representing the victims, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We expect the report to once again outline horrendous levels of abuse. ‘And we believe it will also have uncovered many missed opportunities to stop the abuse and even bring Savile to justice. ‘The victims are hopeful the review will establish a much greater level of accountability than the previous one did. Anything less will rightly be seen as a whitewash by those people still suffering from the awful crimes Savile committed all those years ago.’ Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said it would not comment ahead of the report’s publication today.","Victim, now in her 40s, reveals abuse by former BBC radio DJ 'shaped' her life .

"A father and son were facing child porn charges after sordid material was found at their home during a separate sexual assault investigation involving a 14-year-old girl. Police had executed a search warrant at the Midland Park, New Jersey home of Richard Stoldt, 58, while investigating his 19-year-old son James on Tuesday. According to prosecutors, the 14-year-old girl recently told a friend that James assaulted her when she was 13. Richard Stoldt (right), 58, and his son James (left), 19, were arrested for possessing child pornography that was discovered during a sexual assault investigation allegedly involving James and a 14-year-old girl . The girl was interviewed by police after the friend contacted authorities and James Stoldt was subsequently arrested, according to NBC 4. Computers that were seized from the father and son's home revealed that they were each independently accessing child pornography, according to Bergen County Prosecutor John L. Molinelli. 'Computer media used by each, separate and distinct from one another, were found to contain images depicting the sexual exploitation of children,' Molinelli said in a statement, according to NJ.com. Richard Stoldt, a software engineer, was arrested on a charge of child endangerment and was released on his own recognizance, meaning he did not need to pay bail after agreeing in writing to appear for all of his court proceedings.

"A British grandmother facing the lethal injection in Texas for kidnap and murder is to have her case reviewed after lawyers claimed they have uncovered new evidence. An appeal from Linda Carty will be sent back to her trial court in Houston for additional review in a move welcomed by human rights group Reprieve, which has been helping with her case. Carty was convicted of masterminding the fatal kidnapping of Joana Rodriguez, her 25-year-old neighbour, who was seized by three men along with her four-day-old son in 2001. Case to be reviewed: Linda Carty, above, is on death row after being convicted for the 2001 murder of her neighbor . Ms Rodriguez was later found dead from suffocation, with duct tape over her mouth and a plastic bag around her head. Her body was found in a car Carty had been leasing and the baby was discovered in the vehicle unharmed. There was no forensic evidence linking Carty to the crime, but the three attackers testified that Carty had hired them to carry out the kidnapping as part of a plea bargain that saw them dodge the death penalty. Lawyers for Carty, 56, claim prosecutors coerced witnesses into giving false evidence at the trial where she was convicted. Campaigner Brian Capaloff holds up a placard highlighting Ms Carty's case on top of Trafalgar Square's Fourth Plinth in 2009 . Their appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also argues prosecutors arranged for a deal with a co-defendant that was not disclosed to defense lawyers. They claim that four jurors now say they either would have acquitted Carty or not given her a death sentence. The Harris County prosecutor's office said it was investigating the claims. Former primary school teacher Carty was born on the Caribbean island of St Kitts before its independence from Britain. She had lived in Houston for nearly 20 years before being arrested. Celia Ouellette, staff attorney at Reprieve, said: 'This is a wonderful day for Linda - and for justice. 'That a prosecutor can threaten witnesses to lie under oath and testify against a woman, who ends up being convicted of murder and sentenced to death as a direct result, is truly devastating. A scene from TV show The British Woman On Death Row, with Linda Carty pictured in jail on the left . 'We look forward to giving Linda a day in court that is not rigged against her from the start.' Carty's US lawyer, Michael Goldberg of Baker Botts LLP, said: 'It has long been clear that Linda should have a new trial because of the catalogue of errors in her first. 'Linda's whole team has been working tirelessly for more than a decade to achieve this result and we look forward to giving Linda the chance at justice that she deserves.' Carty has lodged a number of appeals against her conviction, all of which have been rejected. In 2010, Lord Faulkner raised her case in the House of Lords in July, asking British government to press for a reprieve. That same year, she contested her conviction in a video plea alongside a document from the British Government outlining its concerns over the trial. That request for a retrial was based on claims she was given inadequate legal support during her original trial and the Government were blocked in their efforts to help her. Her daughter, Jovelle Carty Joubert, has spent years rallying MPs for support  following the US Supreme Court's refusal to re-open her case. Carty, pictured left, before her arrest. Her daughter, Jovelle Carty Joubert, right, has spent years fighting to clear her mother's name . In 2012, the Foreign Office said it was lobbying the Texas authorities to stop her execution, with a statement reading: 'The Prime Minister and British Government are deeply concerned.' Ms Carty has always insisted she was framed by three men in revenge for her work as an informant working for a drug enforcement agency. If the latest efforts fail, she is to be executed by lethal injection. The last British woman to be executed was Ruth Ellis in 1955. She was hanged for shooting her lover outside a pub in North London.","Linda Carty is facing lethal injection but has always insisted she's innocent .

"Police found the body of a newborn baby boy in the wild brush of a swamp in Northern California on Wednesday morning - two days after he and his mother were reported missing. Yolo County sheriff’s deputies discovered 20-day-old Justice Rees near wetlands along the Sacramento River in Knights Landing after a night of searching. Authorities say that the baby and his mother, 23-year-old Samantha Green, had been reported missing on Monday, but that Green surfaced on Tuesday afternoon after a panicked 911 call. Saddening: Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees in swampy land near the Sacramento River after he and his mother, Samantha Green, 23, were reported missing . News 10 reports Ricardo Villaseñor came upon Green shortly after that call, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough. Villaseñor said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' said Villaseñor. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby was dead, having frozen to death, and though she said she didn't know the exact location of Justice, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Police arrived around 5:30pm and found her 2011 Chevy Tanverse on the other side of the slough, separated from where the mother was by trees and brush. Sheriff's deputies launched a search that lasted through the night and into the morning, combing water and vegetation before finally finding Justice's remains shortly before 10am Wednesday. Scene: Search crews looking through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours through the night before finding Justice's body in the brush . Scene: Investigators flagged the spot where Justice was found by search crews as police say foul play is not suspected at this time . A spokesman for the sheriff's and coroner's office Captain Larry Cecchettini said the boy was 'located in a thicket of brush right off the slough.' The plan was for officers 'to cut a path to get in there to remove the body,' according to Cecchettini, his voice faltering in his announcement. Cecchettini also said that investigators have not found any indication that the baby had been murdered. Johnson said that 'foul play is not suspected at this time' as authorities are investigating the incident, including looking into Green's claim she and her baby were abducted, KGO reports. She was admitted to Woodland Hospital and has since been released. Green's father, Randy, told the Sacramento Bee that he'd spoken to her last on Saturday before she was planning to bring Justice to the house for a visit. Randy Green said that his daughter did not show up that day, and on Monday her mother and her sister reported her and the baby missing. Mother: Green had given birth to Justice only 20 days before she turned up next to the slough, crying and seeming disoriented . Family: Justice's grandfather said the boy's parents, Green and Frank Rees (right), were loving and fussed over the little baby . Loss: The grandfather, Bill Rees, also said that he was having a hard time believing Justice was dead, as his house - where Justice had been living with his parents - was filled with baby clothes and a bassinet . On Tuesday, Justice's father, Frank Rees posted on Facebook begging Green to come home with the baby. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fiancé [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' After police identified the body as Justice on Wednesday, the family of the little boy mourned, still in disbelief. 'They loved baby Justice,' said paternal grandfather Bill, whom Justice and his parents had been living with in Woodland. 'Frank just loved to carry him around at night when he was, he was fussing. Samantha, gosh, I understand she's crushed.' 'It's like it's not real for me, it's like I can't imagine you know,' Rees added. 'This whole house is full of baby clothes, bassinet, all that stuff.'","Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees in an area called the Ridge Cut Slough in Knight's Landing on Wednesday .

RoomAlive is a Holodeck-like concept from Microsoft which turns your whole living room into an immersive gaming experience . A Microsoft research project called RoomAlive could soon be bringing holodecks to your living room. The system of cameras projects images and animations onto the wall, letting the user interact with virtual objects. It can map the geometry of a room in minutes and provide an immersive holodeck-like experience, such as projecting critters running up the walls to shoot or firing incoming 'missiles' to dodge. RoomAlive is being developed by Projection Mapping Central at Microsoft’s Redmond Campus in Washington. The prototype technology can turn any room into an augment reality experience. This includes games where the ‘player’ has to duck and weave from incoming fire, or strike enemies running along the walls. RoomAlive uses six Kinect sensors to track the movement of the player in the room. A projector depth-camera unit known as a procam, meanwhile, uses a wide field of view projector, Kinect sensor and a computer to display the images on the walls.","Beam runs on Android and can run any app from the Google Play store .

"West Palm Beach mayor Jeri Muoio (pictured) has come under fire after footage emerged of her calling slow learners 'dummies' A Florida mayor has come under fire after footage emerged of her calling slow learners 'dummies'. Video footage shows West Palm Beach mayor Jeri Muoio using the term while responding to questions about grouping slower learning children together in one school. But she has already responded to criticism of the comment saying her words were taken out of context and that she would 'never disparage children.' Her use of the term emerged in an advertisement paid for by a committee of former lobbyists in Tallahassee known as Voters Response. The video shows the mayor saying: 'Your're talking about ability ability-grouping kids and putting all the dummies in one place.' It continues with the words 'Did Jeri Muoio really say that?' appearing on screen before the advertisement reruns Muoio saying 'dummies' two more times. On Tuesday, the educator of 30 years responded to the revelation by claiming that she was referring to the wider issue of whether to place slower learning children in one school or have children of all abilities learning together. According to wesh.com, her full comment was: 'We've, for years, fought against ability-grouping and that's what this would be. 'You're talking about ability grouping kids and putting all the dummies in one place. And that's not how kids learn. Kids need to be in heterogeneous groups to learn best.' Hitting back over the ad, wesh.com reports her as saying: 'I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother, I would never disparage children, ever, that's just not who I am. Scroll down for video .

"Extremist: Haitham al-Haddad's speech has been posponed . Jihadi John's former university was a 'hotbed of radicalism' where students 'celebrated 9/11', it has been claimed. A former student has lifted the lid on his time at the University of Westminster - as a talk by a  Muslim extremist has been postponed due to 'security concerns'. Haitham al-Haddad was set to speak tonight, but the event will not go ahead as planned after it was revealed 'Jihadi John' studied computer programming at the university. Today, the terrorist was named as a university graduate from London who was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 terror watch list. Mohammed Emwazi, 27, of Queen’s Park, west London is said to have travelled to the Middle East three years ago and later joined ISIS. Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers. Former University of Westminster pupil Raheem Kassam, who campaigns against extremism at British universities, said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like Emwazi. Speaking today, he said: ‘I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11. ‘I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly unsurprised.' Scroll down for video . Petition: Haitham al-Haddad was set to speak tonight, but the event will not go ahead as planned after it was revealed 'Jihadi John' studied computer programming at the university . ‘The university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when I was there. ‘Universities across the country, the University of Westminster in particular, are being targeted by radical recruiters.' A spokesman from the University of Westminster said: 'We take these allegations very seriously. We condemn any behaviour that promotes terrorism and violence on any of our campuses. 'We have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community, who come to study from over 150 nations. 'Any student found to be engaging in radicalised activity would be referred to disciplinary procedures. 'As a London-based university operating in a diverse multi-cultural city, we are fully aware of all the influences within this international city. With other universities in London, we are working together to implement the Government’s Prevent strategy to tackle extremism. 'We strongly encourage anyone who is concerned about radicalisation to speak out and contact the Student Support and Well-being team. The safety and security of our students is our foremost concern.' Former pupil Raheem Kassam, who campaigns against extremism at British universities, said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like Emwazi . Dr Al-Haddad's planned visit to the university sparked anger and a petition launched by the university’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) society opposing his visit was signed by more than 3,000 people. It has been reported he said gays should be outlawed,  terror boss Osama bin Laden will go to heaven and has also spoken out in favour of female genital mutilation, but he has claimed in the past his comments have been misinterpreted. It's also been claimed he said Jewish people are descended from 'apes and pigs', and says people who leave Islam should be executed, although again he stresses his words have been misinterpreted. I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly, utterly unsurprised. The university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when I was there. Are the conditions at Westminster right for the radicalisation of someone like him? The answer is yes, 100 per cent. I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11. It was at that moment in my life I realised I wanted to set up an organisation in my life to tackle it. Having been brought up in a Muslim household and then seeing that happening is pretty galling stuff.’ Universities across the country, the University of Westminster in particular, are being targeted by radical recruiters. These guys [students] are being professionally radicalised. They tried it with me and they try it with any Muslim. I remember very vividly how I would get cornered by three or four Somali guys - students in the class with me who were dressed in non-western clothing – and they would say I must come along to the Islamic Society meetings otherwise I’m not a proper Muslim. When you are 18-years-old and a practising Muslim you feel inclined to go. I went along and saw what was happening and it absolutely disgusted me. This afternoon, a spokesman for the university said: ‘Tonight’s event has been postponed due to increased sensitivity and security concerns.’ The University of Westminster has been criticised for segregating male and female students during talks by Islamic scholars. It was one of 21 university institutions which were found to promote gender segregation. Research by Student Rights, a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities, said that from September to March 2013, 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated. At the University of Westminster, at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘women only’. The research found that on March 21, 2013 a debate entitled ‘Secularism vs. Islam’ was held by the Women’s Take on Current Affairs Society (WTCA), a Hizb ut-Tahrir front group, and featured Shohana Khan as a speaker. When challenged by students as to why the WTCA was able to hold events segregated by gender, the Student Union Interfaith Officer allegedly claimed that the society’s events were ‘faith-based’, which exempted it from equal opportunities policy. In addition to this, an event the following day was held by the Islamic Society called ‘The Concept of Love in Islam’ which was also advertised as ‘Sisters only’. It was logged by Student Rights for this reason. Student Rights said that when a male student from the society complained about not being able to attend, the Islamic Society highlighted that segregated events were common on campus stating ‘we’ve had many brothers only events too...the information discussed in the only women talks/or notes can be put to the public after the talk...the topics at hand do not only concern women.’ The University of Westminster’s ‘Dignity and Diversity at Work and Study Policy’ states that: ‘The University of Westminster is committed to creating a stimulating, supportive, inclusive and accessible learning and working environment... The University has a legal responsibility to provide a healthy and safe working environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.’ A spokesperson from the University of Westminster said: 'The university does not allow gender segregation and it will not tolerate this type of prejudice. The university strictly complies with the Equality Act 2010 the Human Rights Act 1998. 'The events concerned were not gender segregated events. Many organisations and universities host events which are of interest to women and open to all women, such as feminist groups and women in business networking events. '56% of our international student community are women. 'The Islamic Society is one of many societies that are part of the University of Westminster Students’ Union which is an independent body.

"Carl Chang, 26, has been jailed for four years after a single drop of blood left as he broke into a home in Maidstone lead forensic teams to him . A single drop of blood left at the scene of the crime helped cops nail a serial burglar. Carl Chang was in the process of breaking into a home in Maidstone, Kent, on June 27 last year, when he got a tiny nick on his hand as he smashed a kitchen window to sneak in. The lone drop of blood was spotted by forensics officers, who were called to the scene within hours of the offence taking place, in which cash and jewellery were stolen. Despite Chang, 26, cleaning the window and various doors with cleaning fluid in a bid to get rid of his fingerprints and any traces he had been there, he didn't notice to single drop of his blood on the kitchen doorstep by the smashed window. The serial crook, who had only recently been released from jail after serving time for another burglary, was arrested after cops traced his DNA to previous break-ins in the Kent area. When he was arrested at his home in Orpington, Kent, on July 9 last year he lunged at officers in a desperate bid to get away, but was jailed for four years at Maidstone Crown Court on Monday  after pleading guilty to burglary. A spokesman for Kent Police said this week: 'A burglar has been jailed for four years after a drop of his blood was detected on the doorstep of a home in Maidstone. 'Kent Police matched Carl Chang's DNA to a small blood stain, following a break-in last year. 'Chang smashed a kitchen window to enter the property on 27 June 2014. The 26-year-old stole cash and jewellery before fleeing the scene.' He added: 'After the victim alerted police, crime scene investigators attended the address and detected a fresh drop of blood on a step directly outside the point of entry. 'The blood sample was sent off for forensic analysis and was later identified as a match for Chang. Maidstone Crown Court heard Chang is a prolific burglar who was out on licence for another break-in when he raided the Kent home last year, making off with jewellery and cash . 'Inside the property Chang had used cleaning fluid, in an attempt to remove further evidence of his offending.' Detective Constable Natalie Sammells said: 'At the time of the offence Chang had been on license, following his release from prison for another burglary. 'He is clearly a prolific burglar, whose offending has caused a great deal of distress to the victims, not only through the loss of their personal property, but the invasion of their private space. 'We will continue to pursue all forensic techniques available to gather evidence to bring offenders like Chang to justice and I'm pleased that another repeat offender is behind bars and unable to commit any further crimes.'","Carl Chang, 26, cut his hand while breaking kitchen window during raid .

"A Birmingham family claims they were banned from boarding a plane and left stranded in Turkey for two days after their autistic 11-year-old son was deemed 'unfit to fly' by tour operator Thomas Cook. Arshad Sherbaz and Selina Begun said they were told that their son, Mustafah, was not allowed to board the plane at Dalaman Airport, even though they had already checked in, because he was a 'safety risk' and they did not have a 'fit to fly' certificate from a doctor. They were forced to remain in the country, along with their 19-year-old daughter, Meelam, until they obtained the document and a doctor prescribed anti-anxiety drugs for Mustafah's journey home to Ward End. Arshad Sherbaz (right) and Selina Begun said their 11-year-old son, Mustafah, was not allowed to board . The family spent £2,300 on the Thomas Cook package holiday to the Mediterranean and has been offered an apology and £750 in compensation from the London-based tour operator. They were left feeling angry and embarrassed after they were turned away at the gate and forced to spend an additional £300 on a hotel, food and taxis while they obtained the certificate during their getaway last July. Mustafah's 41-year-old father and full-time caregiver, Arshad, said: 'They told us we needed a doctor's note to allow him to fly from the airport and were asked to sit in another area while we watched all the other passengers board the plane. We were gobsmacked. 'Someone from Thomas Cook told us that they had spoken to the pilot who had refused to let my son on the plane to fly home. They said Mustafah was a safety risk and was not fit to fly. Mustafah, pictured with his mother, has severe autism and uses sign language to communicate . 'We couldn't understand. I had notified Thomas Cook before the holiday about my son's disability. The only thing I could think of was that he had a small tantrum on the flight on the way out.' Mustafah, who communicates through sign language, became stressed during the flight to Turkey and banged on a toilet door, but was calmed down by his father. Arshad described it as 'a long day' as the family had missed its flight from London Gatwick Airport and had to return to Birmingham for another flight. He said: 'My son had been awake a long time and was tired. It was the only reason I could think of why they weren't letting him fly.' The family were left feeling angry after they were turned away at the gate at Turkey's Dalaman Airport . After they were turned away in Dalaman they tried to see the airport doctor but were referred to a local hospital. They were offered an ambulance but were told that they would be billed for the ride. Arshad said: 'They strapped my son to a stretcher and we were all sitting in the back of the ambulance. It just didn't feel right. I didn't have any faith in what was going on. I saw a taxi pull up and put my family in the taxi instead.' After obtaining the certificate and anti-anxiety medication the family had to wait 40 hours for the next flight back to the UK. When they returned to Dalaman Airport, however, neither the airport nor Thomas Cook asked to see the document, said Arshad. 'After all of that they never asked to see the letter. Our week-long holiday, which had been so lovely, ended in a nightmare. 'Mustafah had never taken any medication like that before. We had to trust what they had given him. 'We have always tried to make his life as enjoyable and normal as possible. We have travelled to Morocco, Spain, Italy and the USA, but have never been treated like this.' A Thomas Cook spokesman said the company takes the welfare and safety of its customers 'very seriously', and that the decision to seek a certificate from a medical professional rested with Medlink, a company it contracts. The tour operator told MailOnline Travel: 'Prior to their return flight, the company we use for medical assistance advised that Mr and Mrs Sherbaz's son would need to be seen by a doctor before flying home to ensure he was well enough for the flight. 'Our crew explained this to the family and we ensured they were able to travel to the hospital. They returned to the UK on our flight the next day at no cost and we also ensured they had support and welfare at the airport. 'Our customer services team are now liaising directly with the family to ensure they are compensated for the additional expenses they incurred and we'd like to apologise for any confusion caused during their holiday. 'At all times, our concern was for the health of Master Sherbaz.' Carol Povey, Director of the National Autistic Society’s Centre for Autism, said a ‘fit to fly’ certificate is nothing but an inconvenience for families and could put more stress on the child. She told MailOnline Travel: ‘People with autism and their families want to access the same opportunities most of us take for granted, and this includes holidays and travel. ‘But many rely on routines to make sense of an often confusing world and can find the busy and unpredictable airport and plane environment distressing and disorientating. ‘We struggle to see what difference a 'fit-to-fly' certificate could make to these issues, apart from create an inconvenience which could in itself create more stress for the individual and their family.’ She said airports and airlines can make a difference by helping to prepare a child or adult with autism for their journey so they know what to expect and understand that there could be delays or cancellations. ‘By making small adjustments, they can help build familiarity with the airport process and environment, for instance by having easily accessible information on their websites. ‘Staff at every stage of the flight process, from check-in to arrival at their destination, should be aware of autism so they can notice if a passenger is feeling distressed and offer appropriate support and advice. ‘This type of preparation and support from airports and airlines can prevent other families from having to go through the type of stress and inconvenience experienced by Mustafah and his family.’","Arshad Sherbaz and Selina Begun were travelling with their son, Mustafah .

"Aaron Hill admitted uploading explicit pictures of his former girlfriend, received while he was in jail . A man posted explicit photographs of his former girlfriend, which she had sent to him while he was in prison, after their relationship came to an end. Aaron Hill, of Hall Green, Birmingham, uploaded revenge porn of his former partner on Facebook - tagging her and several friends in naked pictures -  after their three-and-a-half year relationship came to an end in April last year. Hill  received the pictures  from his former partner when he was in prison last year for being part of a group that attacked a shopkeeper with pepper spray, while wearing a babygrow over his face, in a bungled robbery. The 26-year-old was jailed for two years and eight months for the robbery and was released from prison in September. At a hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court he pleaded guilty to uploading the naked pictures and avoided being returned to prison. The court heard that Hill's actions left his former partner feeling 'humiliated and violated'. Warren Stanier, prosecuting, said Hill had first posted an explicit video on Facebook showing his former partner. It was removed after she reported it to the police. But six days later he placed indecent pictures of her on the site with 16 of her friends 'tagged' in the images. Mr Stanier said on August 8 Hill's former partner received a number of messages from friends telling her to look on her account. He said: 'She logged on to her Facebook account using her usual username and saw posted on her wall were six images of her posing naked. 'She recognised those images as images she sent to Mr Hill whilst he was in prison.' Mr Stainer added: 'She feels both humiliated and violated by this intrusion into her privacy. 'She states that the photographs were taken when they were in a loving relationship and she was appalled they were published for her friends and strangers to see. 'She also comments that she was very upset and embarrassed by what these images display.' At an earlier hearing magistrates gave Hill credit for his early guilty plea to sending an electronic communication of a shocking and grossly offensive nature. They sentenced him to a 12-month community order with 200 hours' unpaid work. Hill was also ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge and £180 costs. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard that Hill had pleaded guilty to posting the explicit pictures and video . Hill, pictured leaving Birmingham Magistrates' Court, was not returned to prison . In October 2012 Hill was jailed for robbery after he was part of a gang of three who burst into a store, with their faces covered, and attacked shopkeeper Festus Williams. Mr Williams was sprayed with what appeared to be pepper spray. His wife managed to pull the babygrow off Hill's face and was then struck. Hill was tracked down by DNA he had left on the babygrow and the court heard he had a £1,000 drug debt due to a cocaine and cannabis addiction. In defence the court was told that Hill had only been recruited to grab cigarettes from the store. He was released on licence from prison on September 23 last year and has found work.","Aaron Hill received explicit photos from his then girlfriend while in prison .

"A magazine has been forced to apologise for using a 'skeleton'-like model in its latest issue. The publisher of Danish magazine, Cover, Malene Malling called it a 'sad day' after online backlash and anger over the decision to feature Lululeika in a fashion feature. Malling said: 'I have not lived up to my responsibility as a publisher, woman and mother and am truly sorry.' This picture of the 16-year-old model Lululeika that was published in Danish magazine Cover that has caused outrage and lead the magazines founder to apologise . The picture was originally posted on Reddit where many users rushed to comment on the appearance of the 16-year-old model whose full name is Lululeika Ravn Liep. One named 'Keepitgoinglouder' said: 'I totally understand that in fashion, clothes tend to ""hang"" better on slender frames but this is taking it way too far. 'Not only does she look like a skeleton, her whole complexion and facial expression makes it seem like she is near death. Glad to hear the editor took responsibility for this poor choice.' Another named 'Lincolnparkafterdark,' said: 'I genuinely don't understand how a look this emaciated can be considered beautiful or fashionable or sexy in any country/culture. 'This poor girl clearly needs help. It's obvious she's not healthy. It's so detrimental to young girls around the world to glamorize eating disorders.' Cover magazine issued an apology after featuring the slim model however the magazine's fans are still unimpressed by their actions . Lululeika has previously featured in a Louis Vuitton show, modelling their Spring Summer 2015 collection at Paris Fashion Week in October . Indeed, many have been quick to point out that the model herself should not be the subject of the negative comments. Her agency Scoop have been quick to defend her saying: 'The model is in a bad time in her life after losing two members of her family. 'So we ask that all comments are made ​​with respect and without calling [her] sick, because it is not.' Lululeika has also previously worked for French fashion house Louis Vuitton. She modeled their SS15 collection in Paris in October. After the apology was posted to the magazine's Facebook many of their readers were still not happy. One woman commented: '[It is] Super easy for you to show all of them (us) who doubt the sincerity of your excuse that you really mean what you say. 'You donate simply last year's profits to the Mental Health Foundation or the Association on Eating Disorders, so they can do something for all the girls daily battling anorexia !!!! [sic].' The magazine claims that they aim to promote different types of women and says that it is a 'sad day' in that they have to apologise . Whilst another said: 'Anorexia is a very complex medical and PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS with a HIGH MORTALITY, which incidentally affects both girls and boys! 'Severe malnutrition can cause irreparable damage to all organs !!! This is not a question of taste anymore, but ....... LIFE and DEATH!' The Danish Tax Minister Benny Englebrecht was one of many who took to Facebook and to voice his disgust at the image saying: 'I seriously thought that the fashion industry had understood that anorexia is a problem that should be taken seriously.' Lululeika herself has not  directly commented on the image. Femail spoke to Mary George at Beat, the UK's leading charity for the support of those suffering from or affected by eating disorders. She said: 'Although we should remember that some models with a naturally low body weight are healthy this particular image looks unreal and it is indeed possible to be influenced by images that do not portray reality.' Going on to add: 'People who are at risk, or already affected by an eating disorder can be triggered or maintained in the disorder by the images they see everywhere so we would urge any publisher to think long and hard about portraying such unhealthy ideals.' Malling said she had worked in magazines for more than ten years, adding: 'This time unfortunately made ​​a big mistake, I would apologise.' She said: 'On the Cover, we have, in all the years, worked to show an expanded beauty ideal. [To] show that you can be beautiful in various ages and various sizes. 'We have always sought to work with healthy girls. Just two months ago we had plus-size model Diana Graham on the front of the Cover, so it is certainly a subject we focus on.'","Malene Malling said that she had made a 'big mistake'

"A volunteer firefighter in Royce City, Texas, has been forced to resign after he killed two dogs and callously boasted about it by posting a photo of their lifeless bodies on Facebook. Tim Conatser claims he killed the two Labradors after warning their owner, his neighbor, to keep them away from his livestock. The incident has enraged animal lovers worldwide and now the owner of the dead animals – a black dog called Gordo and a yellow lab called Spike - is denying that Conatser ever approached him to complain about them. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE . A tearful Pulido Rodrigo said he was in shock after finding out via social media that his two dogs had been killed . Suspended: Conatser's photo has won him death threats from around the world and gotten him suspended from his volunteer firefighter job . 'I'm in shock. I don't know. I don't understand these people. Bad people, I don't know,' Pulido Rodrigo told Fox 4. He said he only found out about the brutal incident via social media. Criticism of Conatser's actions and even death threats have since poured into tiny Union Valley Volunteer Fire Department from all over the U.S. and as far as western Europe. However, it's the laws in Hunt County, Texas, that will decide what happens as Constable Terry Jones launches a criminal investigation to determine if what Conatser allegedly did constitutes animal cruelty. 'We've had I don't know how many hits,' fire chief Edward Ragsdale said about the department's social media. 'We've had (them) from as far away as England, Portugal, Canada, every state in the union.' However, Ragsdale said he can't take responsibility for the grisly Facebook post. 'This is an individual that's a volunteer with our department,' Ragsdale said. 'We can't be responsible for his actions when he's off duty.' Dog killer: Tim Conatser reportedly killed two dogs after warning their owners, his neighbors, to keep them away from his livestock then put photos of their dead bodies on Facebook . Those actions allegedly include Conatser writing a grammatically confusing yet haunting message to his neighbors along with the unsettling photo. 'Somebody didn't put any truth my warning,' Conatser wrote. 'Keep your damn dogs on your property.' Conatser, who was suspended from his position with the Union Valley Volunteer Fire Department after his post went viral, has now resigned. 'We do not condone the recent actions of one of our firefighters. We are following our policy in removing him from our department,' the department said it a statement. Both the Hunt County Constables Office and the SPCA are now investigating to determine if animal cruelty charges should be filed. Conatser may have been within his rights to shoot the dogs per local law. His friend Kevin Forester told CBSDFW that the trouble began days earlier when Conatser discovered the dogs attacking a calf in his barn. 'So he went over to his neighbor's and told him that his dogs was getting in his barn and attacking his animals, to please - ya know - keep 'em at home, put 'em on a leash, build a fence, do something,' claims Forester.","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE .

"A smart lock that promises to make keys history by letting you to open your front door with a secret knock has launched a Kickstarter campaign. Sesame allows you to open your front door with a single tap on your phone as you approach it, so you don't need to fumble around getting your keys out of your pocket. You can also teach the app your own personal secret knock, so you won't even need to take your phone out at all. Sesame is available to pre-order for $99 (£63) or $149 (£96) dollars with an added Wi-Fi connection. Scroll down for Video . Open Sesame: the smart lock promises to replace keys with a smartphone app and module that fits over your latch. When you approach your front door, the system recognises you and open the lock for you . The module fixes over your deadbolt and can be installed in 'literally seconds'. Candy House, the start-up behind Sesame also claim that it will work with any latch in the world . Candy House, the company behind Sesame, claim that their smart lock Sesame 'has a patented design that fits any latch, anywhere in the world.' 'One thing that makes Sesame stand out is our unique turning mechanism,' claim the Sesame team on their Kickstarter page. 'Other smart locks requires a point-to-point accuracy at installation to turn properly, meaning the rotation centre of these locks must be placed exactly over the rotation centre of your deadbolt in order for it to work. 'Sesame works area-to-point, allowing it to work under any orientation and installation tolerance, hence the no-tools installation.' At Mobile World Congress 2014 Qualcomm showed off its vision of the Connected Home where appliances 'talk' to each other using wifi and blutooth . In the home of the future, the front door will ‘talk’ to your smoke alarm, lights will flash when the fridge door is left open and a teddy will put your child to bed. That’s the vision presented by Qualcomm at Mobile World Congress 2014 in its Connected Home, which shows how almost anything in your house can either be controlled by a mobile, or be linked together electronically. Other features include the August smart lock that unlocks the front door when the home owner is near, smart TVs that show notifications and can warn when a child is using the web when they should be asleep and a system that lets you change all the clocks in your home at the touch of a button. All the products in Qualcomm’s concept three-roomed house are sold by individual companies, or have been developed by the California-based firm, but they all run the AllJoyn software. AllJoyn is an open source project set up by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2011. It is a programme that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘talk’ to other devices running AllJoyn. The company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further. It works by letting users set triggers for events. For example, if someone opens the fridge door this triggers an event, such as making smart lights flash, or an alarm to sound. At the front of Qualcomm’s house was the August smart lock. Fitted to the existing door lock, the battery-powered device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the August app. To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app. The lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired Bluetooth device. It then confirms the visitor's identity. A an early prototype of Sesame demonstrating its latch opening mechanism . The company claim it takes 'literally seconds' to install. The app can be taught to recognise you friends by detecting their phone too, so you can let them in when you are out - or alternatively, block people who you don't want coming in. Sesame can be set up to give you notifications every time your door opens or closes, so you can know exactly who what is going on at home while you are at work. The system works by using Bluetooth to detect you approaching via your phone, which prompts the smart lock - which fits over your regular deadbolt - to open the door for you. The project has already reached their target funding of $100,000 (£64,000), but are seeking to raise extra funds to include voice recognition and facial recognition. Candy House claim to have 'military grade encryption' to stop burglars from hacking the smart lock. However there are still security concerns. For example, if your phone is stolen or if someone learns your secret knock, your home could be more vulnerable than it would be with a standard lock and key. With the optional Wi-Fi addition you can control Sesame when you are away from home, for example to let a friend in. Sesame also provides notifications to your phone every time your door is opened .","Smart lock Sesame will make keys history by opening door with an app .

"The American Family Association, who recently said that God is going to use ISIS to punish the United States for being tolerant of LGBT people, have created a 'hate list' of groups they say defy their own beliefs, including atheists, humanists and pro-gay rights groups. The fundamentalist organization - notorious for its opposition to homosexuality and same-sex marriage, abortion and pornography - has formatted the list on their website, calling it the 'anti-Christian bigotry map', saying those listed are 'deeply intolerant' to their faith and want 'to silence Christians and to remove all public displays of Christian heritage and faith in America'. The non-profit - based in Tulepo, Mississippi - has even targeted leading social justice organizations, such as the Human Rights Campaign (HRC),  the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the Southern Poverty Law Center and People for the American Way, for the map. Evangelical churches were not featured on the list just because they are in agreement that homosexuality is a sin, religious website Patheos noted. 'Hate list': The American Family Association, a fundamentalist Christian non-profit, has released this interactive map on their website, allowing followers to identify what the AFA says are groups that are 'deeply intolerant towards the Christian religion' and some who have 'committed violent crimes against Christians and faith-based groups' Key: The website allows users to navigate the map according to which 'hate group' they want to find . The map appears to be a reaction to a list of 'hate groups' released by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The AFA has been on that list, something they have called 'slanderous'. The Southern Poverty Law Center says those identified 'have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics'. However the groups that  feature on the AFA map don't seem too bothered. On their website, the HRC wrote in response: 'We, as well as the rest of the LGBT community, will be able to find each other and unite as 'advocates for the legalization and promotion of same-sex marriage'. Hurrah!' The organization also pointed out some apparent inaccuracies in the map. 'Unfortunately, however, we will be not be able to meet at HRC’s offices in North Dakota, Dallas and Austin that are included on the AFA’s map, because they don’t exist. Gosh darn.' Fundamentalists: The American Family Association is headquartered in Tulepo, Mississippi (left) and presided over by Tim Wildmon, son of AFA founder, Reverend Donald Wildmon . However the AFA remained defiant in standing up for their cause. 'Some members or supporters of these groups (on the map) have committed violent crimes against Christians and faith-based groups,' the organization said. 'Physical and profane verbal assaults against Christians are methods frequently exercised in their angry methods of intimidation.' Tim Wildmon, the son of the American Family Association's founder, Reverend Donald Wildmon, is the current President. The AFA promotes itself as 'one of the largest and most effective pro-family organizations in the country'. The organization recently spoke out in support of Uganda’s passing an anti-gay law that calls for LGBT Ugandans or anyone 'promoting' homosexuality to be jailed, potentially for life.","American Family Association strongly opposes homosexuality, abortion and pornography .

"After almost seven years, the end in convicted killer Jodi Arias' case is in sight as the jury began deliberations on Wednesday to determine whether she will receive the death penalty for murdering her boyfriend in 2008. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' life during his closing arguments, saying the 34-year-old was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Travis Alexander. Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'. Jury began deliberations on Wednesday to determine whether Jodi Arias (pictured at Maricopa County Superior Court on Feb 24) will receive the death penalty for murdering her former boyfriend, Travis Alexander, in 2008 . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' (pictured with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott) life during his closing arguments on Tuesday, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by Alexander . 'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument. Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim, according to the Associated Press. He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez (pictured during closing arguments on Feb 24) displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument and called Arias a liar . If the jury reaches deadlock, the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Sherry Stephens (pictured on Feb 24) will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years . So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation. Arias stabbed Alexander nearly 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead in an act she claimed was in self-defense. Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later. Prosecutors said Arias had planned the murder in advance because she was jealous Alexander wanted to break up with her and was planning a trip to Mexico with another woman. Arias claimed Alexander was abusive and obsessed with sex. After she was convicted of murder, Arias said during a jailhouse interview with Fox that she desired the death penalty because it was the 'ultimate freedom'. Arias was convicted of first-degree murder for the death of Alexander in 2008. She claimed she killed him in an act of self-defense, while prosecutors claimed she murdered him in a jealous rage . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . But the trial's jury deadlocked when debating Arias ultimate fate, requiring a second sentencing phase. Arias' new trial began in October and Judge Sherry Stephens banned news organizations from live broadcasting the case. She ruled that court proceedings could only be aired after the verdict, which  can be aired live. In November, Arias pleaded for her life in front of the jury. The judge allowed her to testify in secret and sealed the testimony to the public, but transcripts were released after news organizations complained and an appeals court threw out the decision. If Arias receives the death penalty she will be only the third woman on death row in Arizona. The new jury of eight woman and four men left for the day on Wednesday without having reached a decision. If they reach deadlock the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Stephens will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.","If there is no unanimous decision, judge will sentence Arias to life in prison and will decide if she has the possibility of parole in 25 years .

"He has often been mocked for his bland casual clothes. But David Cameron today reveals that his outfits are chosen for him by his wife Samantha. Mr Cameron has worn his favourite navy blue polo shirt on every summer holiday for several years, and was accused of a fashion faux pas by teaming it with black shoes with no socks on. In an interview with Woman and Home magazine today, the Prime Minister says he is ‘not really interested in clothes’ and is happy to wear whatever his wife selects for him – provided it doesn’t make him ‘stand out’. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister has a fondness for plain shirts, as seen in photos taken while he is on holiday. Here he is pictured in 2011 with his wife Samantha at a cafe in Montevarchi near Siena, Italy . During the Italy trip In 2011, Mr Cameron was mocked for wearing what looked like pair of black work loafers without socks . Samantha Cameron has 'extremely good taste' in clothes, according to her husband. Here she is pictured yesterday while out and about in London . ‘Samantha has extremely good taste,’ he says. ‘And I'm not really interested in clothes, mainly I like wearing clothes that don't make me stand out. ‘I tend to go for Marks & Spencer and Gap, and I do get put in the changing room at Gap and clothes are passed to me under the changing room door - a bit like feeding time at the zoo!’ In a soft focus interview, Mr Cameron says that his constituency house in Oxfordshire ‘feels more and more like home’, despite the attractions of Downing Street and his country retreat Chequers. He describes himself as ‘optimistic and fun’, but also ‘driven’. The Tory leader - who has been mocked for his fondness for ‘chillaxing’ – defends his practice of ‘taking breaks’ from work. Asked how his friends viewed him, Mr Cameron says: ‘I hope they'd say I'm optimistic, I enjoy life and that I'm fun. ‘But also that I'm quite driven in doing what I believe in. I really profoundly believe in this job and what I'm doing but I try to keep a balance because although this job is a complete passion, at the same time it's my judgment that matters so I've got to keep good balance and pace to make sure I don't get frazzled and fried. ‘So I do take breaks - last weekend I did an eight-mile bicycle ride along the Windrush valley in beautiful cold sunshine with Samantha and two of our children. ‘That, to me, was a perfect Sunday morning.’ Asked about his perfect night in, he says: ‘It involves cooking - and eating - then watching a good detective drama on TV, or House Of Cards,’ he says. ‘Ideally we'd be at our house in Oxfordshire, which feels more and more like home.

David Cameron's dubious choice of footwear in Cornwall last year was this battered pair of sandals . No socks appears to be a recurrent theme - here are the loafers he wore while on holiday in Portugal a month earlier . ‘I love cooking - it's a very good way to get your mind off things. Yesterday I made roast chicken and all the trimmings, and my signature dish is probably something slow-cooked - like belly of pork or shoulder of lamb. ‘I'm also an obsessive barbecuer; one of the most exciting moments of the year for me is when the cover comes off the barbecue!’ Mr Cameron also praises the ‘sensible’ way his children deal with life at Number 10. ‘My eldest two know that Daddy is Prime Minister, which means a lot of stuff in the newspapers, but they seem to channel it quite sensibly,’ he says. ‘They like their school, they've got lots of friends and they like seeing me as much as possible - at least I hope they do! ‘My youngest is only four and it probably hasn't sunk in for her yet. But she has a good school and if we provide stability for them at home, I'm sure they will be OK.’ * The full interview is in the April issue of Woman & Home, which is on sale now.

"There are a lot of new things in his life - new long hair, new single life, new problems (the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was involved in a fatal accident earlier this month) and now a new mansion. On Thursday Bruce Jenner was spotted moving into the very private and roomy hilltop property nestled deep within the hills of Malibu. Surrounding homes sell for $10m. Earlier the 65-year-old ex-husband of momager Kris Jenner showed off manicured nails (and he is still wearing that wedding band) as he stopped by Starbucks coffee in the beachside town. Scroll down for video . On the move: Bruce Jenner was seen leaving a Starbucks in Malibu on Thursday morning before he headed to his new hilltop mansion . The ring is still on (and the nails are painted too): The former Olympian divorced Kris in December . The former Olympian was seen making sure several items got taken into the new pad. There was a king-sized mattress and an iron bed frame, among other things, that were being moved into the estate that had views of the Pacific Ocean as well as neighboring canyons. Also at  spread - which has three garages - was his son Brandon. The musician went shirtless as he moved bar stools from a white pickup truck into the flashy residence. The stepfather to Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob had on a blue striped golf shirt, grey slacks and wore his long mane down. The light grey 3,500 square-foot home is far from modest. According to People, it has four bedrooms and four bathrooms and sit on 11 acres. It's not small: The E! star's new spread has four bedrooms and four bathrooms as well as a swimming pool . Lots of room to do his thing: The residence, which looks to be brand new, sits on 11 acres . A three car garage for all those toys he has: The fan of mini helicopters will most likely be houses here; outside was son Brandon, who appeared shirtless, and a friend . 'For someone seeking privacy, the property is a gem,' a source told the site. There is a large rectangular pool in the back and an oversized balcony that could fit at least 20 people. The style is modern with floor to ceiling windows. Though it is large, the property is much less ornate that the Spanish style home he shared with Kris, 59, in Hidden Hills until 2013. The Malibu residence also appears to be brand new with an untouched roof and what appears to be fresh landscaping around the home. Fresh start: The former Olympian was seen making sure several items got taken into the new pad . Casual for the new place: The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star wore a blue striped golf shirt . Bruce may have chosen to move now as he has been under the microscope lately. Not only has he been strongly hinting that he wants to transition into a female (thanks to longer hair, painted nails and what appears to be a more curvy body sometimes covered by Spanx), but he was also the center of a fatal accident on Pacific Coast Highway on February 7. The father of model daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, was driving a dark blue Cadillac Escalade at the time and dragging a dune buggy when he hit 69-year-old widow Kim Howe of nearby Calabasas. A lot of things to move in: In addition to mattresses and a bed frame, there were bar stools and surf boards . Go daddy!: Brandon watched as Bruce went back into the home where he will no doubt be filming his new E! reality series . Views for miles: The mansion, which probably cost as much as $10m, oversees the Pacific Ocean . She was in a white Lexus and pushed into oncoming traffic where a black Hummer smash into her, causing her to die. Several others were involved in the accident as well and were taken to the hospital. On Wednesday it was revealed Jenner was going 38 mph. It has also been speculated that the E! star could have hit two cars in the pile up. TMZ reported the accident was caught by cameras mounted on an MTA bus. He is doing some heavy lifting himself: On Wednesday Bruce was seen behind the wheel of his white Ford pickup truck which was stuffed with furniture . It is still not clear how the accident happened though it has been speculated that Bruce could have been texting, smoking or looking down, and that is how he rear-ended Howe. At first a Jenner source claimed paparazzi were chasing the star, but police ruled that out quickly. Once a power couple: The sports icon with Kris in 2010; she is credited with making him very rich off their reality show and endorsements . His old pad: The property is much less ornate that the Spanish style home he shared with Kris, 59, in Hidden Hills . Gone: The crash victim is Kim Howe, 69 . Since the accident, the attention on Bruce has only intensified with weekly magazines making him a main subject. On Wednesday Star reported that the single reality star is interested in dating women still. 'He's not sure if the hormone treatments will change how he feels about men,' a family insider said in the March 9 edition. 'But right now he says that he still likes women.' That same day InTouch Weekly revealed old photos of the sports icon dresses as a woman from the early eighties to be a part of a Bob Hope special. People had a story too, claiming Bruce has 'cried with Kris' over the accident on PCH. 'She has told him that no matter what happens next, they're going to face it as a family,' a source insisted. 'Bruce has Kris' full support. She'll be there for him to lean on every step of the way. Bruce is really devastated that someone died in the accident. It's a very dark time.' This is what could have happened: It has been speculated that the February 7 fatal crash Jenner was involved in on PCH was caused by Bruce who hit two cars and not just one .","The mansion has four bedrooms and is 3,500 sq feet with three garages .

"In ten years we might look back at how we used to have to wait for films to download, or web pages to load, and wonder how we ever coped. A team of researchers has developed a 5G data connection that is 65,000 times faster than current 4G technology. The astonishing speed reached one terabit (125 gigabytes) per second - the equivalent of downloading about 30 movies in a single second. Scientists at the University of Surrey showcased their new 5G technology. They say it is capable of reaching speeds of one terabit per second. That is 65,000 times faster than current 4G technology. It means you could download 100 movies (stock image shown) in just three seconds . The technology was developed by scientists from the University of Surrey's 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC). While comparable speeds have been seen in fibre optic cables before, this was the first test ever to achieve such a capacity wirelessly. The team built their own transmitters and receivers, and then performed tests over a distance of 330 feet (100 metres). An army of airborne drones could soon be used to bring mobile phone signal and wireless internet access to the most remote parts of the UK. Britain’s biggest mobile phone group EE has begun working on the technology, which it hopes to deploy by the end of the decade. Using unmanned drones to broadcast phone signal to rural communities is cheaper than erecting traditional masts, it said. The devices, called Air Masts, are still at an early stage of development. But early plans indicate they will be able to fly 0.6 miles (1km) into the air in order to pick up signal from masts up to 12 miles (20km) away. They will then beam this signal into the area below it, allowing villages below to make mobile phone calls and access the internet. This avoids the need to expensive cables in the ground and base stations. The speeds far exceed anything achieved before for 5G, eclipsing the 7.5 gigabits (940 megabytes) per second speed achieved by Samsung in October 2014. The team wants to begin testing their technology in public spaces by 2018, while a British release of 5G has been hinted at in 2020 by Ofcom. ‘We want to be the first in the world to show such high speeds,’ Professor Rahim Tafazolli, director of the 5GIC,’ told V3. He added: ‘We have developed 10 more breakthrough technologies and one of them means we can exceed 1Tbps wirelessly. ‘This is the same capacity as fibre optics but we are doing it wirelessly.’ Some of the benefits of 5G include the possibility of playing holographic games in real-time with other smartphone users, or significantly improving time delays in financial trading. Ofcom has said previously that it expects 5G to be capable of delivering 10 to 50 gigabits per second - but this later development would blow that estimate out of the water. The speeds far exceed anything achieved before for 5G, eclipsing the 7.5 gigabits (940 megabytes) per second speed achieved by Samsung in October 2014.

"This is the terrifying moment a trawler crew pulled in its net to find a 1,000lb unexploded Second World War bomb. The three-foot explosive - believed to have been jettisoned off the North East coast by an RAF bomber - was reeled in by the crew on board the Ticino vessel off the coast of South Shields. The crew immediately alerted the coastguard, with members boarding the ship to help move the bomb to Whitley Bay. An unexploded Second World War bomb was hauled off the seabed by a trawler off the North East coast . A Navy bomb disposal squad and divers from Clyde Naval Base confirmed the 1,000lb explosive was British. They ensured it was dropped into waters around a quarter of a mile from the coast before a controlled detonation took place. Adrian Don, a member of the Tynemouth RNLI, said the crew were shocked when they hauled the large explosive aboard their vessel. He said: 'The lifeboat went out to escort the boat with the bomb. It had been caught up in the nets and hauled on board. The explosive is said to have been jettisoned by an RAF bomber during the Second World War . While unexploded Second World War bombs are not often found, this one follows a spate of weapons washed up on the south coast last year. In April last year, a hand grenade was found on Charnmouth beach, Dorset, by a man who then tried to take it to a fossil museum, sparking panic. It was later detonated on the beach. In March, a shell from a WWII Howitzer gun was discovered on the same stretch of beach  and in February, Perranporth beach in Cornwall was closed briefly after a WWII bomb was washed up in storms. In January, a suspected Second World War explosive was safely detonated by a bomb disposal squad after washing up in bad weather on St Anne's beach in Lancashire. 'The weight of it, the crew must have thought they had a huge catch. 'The lifeboat crew went on board to help rig up some rope work to lower it over the side at Whitley Bay.' He added that the sea bed is littered with thousands of these devices, which have been left over from both the First and Second World Wars, and it is not unusual for them to get caught up nets. The bomb was taken out to sea earlier today so it could be safely destroyed. A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'Our divers and bomb disposal squad were dispatched to the scene, and found it was an unexploded, 1,000lb British bomb. 'It was taken ashore and then dropped into the waters around a quarter of a mile from the coast before it was destroyed in a controlled explosion.'","Unexploded 1,000lb Second World War bomb pulled into net by a trawler .

"The White House threatened Wednesday to veto a Republican bill to overhaul the widely criticized No Child Left Behind law, calling the effort 'a significant step backwards.' The veto threat came as lawmakers began debate on the measure in the House. A vote is expected on Friday. Republicans say the bill would restore local control in schools and stop top-down education mandates. Democrats say it would allow billions in federal dollars to flow out without ensuring they will improve student learning. The White House threatened Wednesday to veto a Republican bill to overhaul the widely criticized No Child Left Behind law, calling the effort 'a significant step backwards' The bill maintains annual federal testing requirements. It consolidates or eliminates many federal programs, creates a single local grant program and allows public money to follow low-income children to different public schools. It would also prohibit the federal education secretary from demanding changes to state standards or imposing conditions on states in exchange for a waiver around federal law. Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia said the bill would allow states to redirect federal funds away from districts with high concentrations of poor students. 'In other words, the low-income areas would get less, the wealthy areas would get more,' Scott said. 'If that's the solution, I wonder what you think the problem was.' The White House said it was opposed to the bill because it 'abdicates the historic federal role in elementary and secondary education of ensuring the educational progress of all of America's students, including students from low-income families, students with disabilities, English learners, and students of color.' Furthermore, the bill 'fails to identify opportunity gaps or remedy inequities in access to the resources,' the White House said. The statement was the latest in a series of veto threats issued by President Barack Obama since both chambers of Congress went under Republican control last month. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio called the education measure 'a good conservative bill that empowers America and does not empower the bureaucracy here in Washington.' 'If you step back and look at what the president’s doing, the president’s trying to protect the bureaucracy here in Washington,' he said in a statement. 'We’re for an opportunity society and empowering people around America to do their best and to empower them to get the education that’ll help them be successful in life.' At a news conference Wednesday, Boehner called education 'the civil right of the 21st century.' The measure, pushed by Education Committee Chairman John Kline, of Minnesota, would provide states and local communities greater flexibility over how 'federal dollars are used to educate America's kids,' Boehner said. Kline said education can be the 'great equalizer' in America, but only if schools succeed. About 1 in 5 students drops out of high school, and many who do graduate enter college or the workforce with subpar education, Kline said. He decried federal mandates that dictate how to gauge student achievement, define qualified teachers and spend money. 'We need to place less faith in the secretary of education and more faith in parents, teachers and state and local leaders,' he said. Speaker of the House John Boehner accused the president on Wednesday of 'trying to protect the bureaucracy here in Washington.' Republicans, he said, are for empowering people around America to do their best and to empower them to get the education that’ll help them be successful in life' The bipartisan No Child Left Behind law President George W. Bush signed in 2002 sought to close significant gaps in the achievement of historically underserved group of students and their more affluent peers. It mandated annual testing in reading and math for students in grades three to eight and again in high school. Schools had to show student growth or face consequences. No Child Left Behind required that all students be able to read and do math at grade level by 2014. The Obama administration in 2012 began allowing waivers around some of the law's more stringent requirements if schools agreed to certain conditions, like using college- and career-ready standards such as Common Core. House Republican leaders view the bill as a way to show their opposition to the Obama administration's encouragement of the Common Core state standards. The standards have been adopted in more than 40 states and spell out what English and math skills students should master at each level. They have become a political issue in many states because they are viewed by critics as a federal effort even though they were developed by U.S. governors. In the Senate, there appears to be more of a bipartisan effort to fix the law. Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the committee's senior Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, have said they were working together on a proposal. Alexander said this week he wants to get a bill to the full Senate in March.","President Bush signed the bipartisan No Child Left Behind law in 2002 .
Republicans say their changes would restore local control in schools and stop top-down education mandates coming from Washington bureaucrats .
The new bill maintains annual federal testing requirements. It would allows public money to follow low-income children to different public schools .
But according to the White House, it 'fails to identify opportunity gaps or remedy inequities in access to the resources'"
"The BBC is a profligate and inept organisation that has lost public trust after a series of scandals, MPs will say today. In a landmark report, the MPs paint a devastating picture of an organisation that has blown millions and tries to be ‘all things to all people’. Bosses are also accused of blaming others for their blunders and showing ‘a mind-set completely out of kilter with public sector principles’. The MPs, who sit on the Commons culture committee, say the £145.50-a-year licence fee is anachronistic and failure to pay it should no longer be a criminal offence. Scroll down for video . Dark past: Former BBC star Jimmy Savile in 2006 with Helen Boaden, now Director of BBC Radio . Their 166-page report, Future of the BBC, says the corporation has squandered hundreds of millions of pounds, handing out sky-high pay-offs to sacked staff and wasting massive sums on vanity projects. And they highlight a ‘bleak period’ in the 1970s and 1980s when presenters including Jimmy Savile carried out scores of sex attacks, including rapes, on BBC premises. ‘We do not see a long-term future for the licence fee in its current form,’ the report concludes. Under fire: Tony Hall, current Director-General of the corporation. The BBC has been heavily criticised in the 166-page report, called 'The Future of the BBC' To be presented in Parliament this afternoon, it recommends that: . Last night John Whittingdale, who chairs the committee, said: ‘When an organisation is in receipt of nearly £4billion of public money, very big questions have to be asked about how that money is provided and spent, and how that organisation is governed and made accountable. ‘In the short term, there appears to be no realistic alternative to the licence fee, but that model is becoming harder and harder to justify and sustain.’ The Tory MP said the corporation made a valuable contribution to public life, but that it needed to examine its size and scope, and cut certain services. Critical: Conservative MP John Whittingdale said that while tje corporation made a valuable contribution to public life, it needed to examine its size and scope, and cut certain services . He added: ‘The BBC has tried for too long to be all things to all people – with the rapid changes in communication and media technology and markets and changing audience needs and behaviours, this no longer works. 'It should tailor its output to what it does best, and not stray into areas that can and should be left to commercial providers to do well. BRITAIN risks losing the ‘global information war’ as the BBC World Service is out-gunned by foreign state-backed broadcasters. MPs said the corporation’s long-established foreign arm could struggle to compete against other networks because of changes to its structure and funding. ‘At a time when countries like Russia and China are increasing their investment in media, including services aimed at the UK, we believe that the World Service has an increasingly important role in what is a global information war,’ their report said. ‘Given its new funding and oversight arrangements, we fear the importance of the World Service could be diminished.’ Until last April, the World Service received a separate grant from the Foreign Office – but the foreign arm is now funded by the licence fee. ‘It is pointless and wasteful having an organisation receiving that kind of public funding competing with – and potentially crowding out – other providers.’ Anyone watching programmes when they are broadcast requires a television licence, regardless of whether they use a TV or a computer. However, there is no legal requirement to pay for watching the same programmes online on catch-up services such as iPlayer after they have aired. The MPs call for urgent changes that would force people to pay for the iPlayer service, for example by blocking non-subscribers. The corporation must ‘prepare itself’ for the licence fee to be abolished altogether in the 2020s, the report says. The levy should be replaced by a flat-rate charge, payable by all households. A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘This report confirms the importance of the BBC in national life and recommends maintaining and modernising the licence fee, something we have said is necessary. ‘We’re grateful to the committee for endorsing our record for efficiency and maintaining the quality of programmes and services, and note members overwhelmingly voted against moving to a subscription funding model.’ The BBC Trust said it was ‘seeking to address’ some of the problems highlighted in the report. The committee took evidence over two years from former BBC bosses and from the public. SEND IN THE AUDITORS TO CUT DOWN ON WASTE: MPs say public have lost faith in bosses because of spending scandals . The National Audit Office must be given unfettered access to the ‘profligate’ BBC’s books to ensure it isn’t squandering public money, say MPs. A succession of spending scandals has ‘dented’ public faith in the broadcaster, their report said, and confidence needs restoring.. Expensive: Broadcasting House in London now costs £89million a year to run – a third of the cost of running the total BBC estate – yet it houses just a fifth of its staff . The NAO has already censured the BBC over the £2billion it has spent on three costly building projects, including its £1billion London headquarters, which was delayed by four years and went £107million over budget. Broadcasting House now costs £89million a year to run – a third of the cost of running the total BBC estate – yet it houses just a fifth of its staff. THE BBC should own up to its mistakes and end a culture where bosses try to blame others for their errors, the report claims. It says the Corporation is ‘beset by problems of its own making’, but instead of dealing with them openly, its senior managers point the finger at other people. ‘[There have been] notable failures and underperformance in certain areas which the BBC has not always been ready to acknowledge until well after the fact,’ it said. The BBC and the BBC Trust should also stop attempting to bury information that could cast the Corporation in a negative light, it added. ‘In our view, the BBC Trust and the BBC Executive have often tended to highlight favourable performance figures over the less favourable...The BBC should aim to be a better, more transparent, self-critic.’ Meanwhile, the Corporation has written off nearly £100million on a Digital Media Initiative technology project, so badly mismanaged that director general Tony Hall decided to scrap it three years in. The BBC’s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, also squandered public funds. In 2007, it bought the travel publisher Lonely Planet in a deal worth £130million. However, it failed to make a success of the business, and sold it off at an £80 million loss six years later. The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said: ‘The Digital Media Initiative was found to have been mismanaged on a large scale and was dropped having delivered few benefits at a loss of £100million. ‘BBC Worldwide’s move into risky commercial activities, not in line with the BBC’s core public service remit, led to a similar loss.’ It added: ‘Given the financial problems in the current charter period which dented the BBC’s reputation, the NAO must now be given unrestricted access to the BBC if it is to provide assurance that the Corporation is spending money wisely and trading fairly.’ MPs also slammed the BBC over the £369million in pay-offs it has handed to departing staff. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The NAO already has extensive access to the BBC’s affairs and recently produced a report commending the savings we have made on our properties.’","Landmark report blasts BBC as inept and say it has lost public confidence .

"Researchers at Monash University, in collaboration with their spin out company Amaero, have created the world’s first 3D-printed jet engine, possibly revolutionising the design and cost of aerospace materials . Amaero is already working with six tier-one air space companies, however, with the unit currently on display at Avalon International Air show, the engine is also capturing the attention of commercial outfitters like Boeing and Airbus. David Lyster, Monash University Manger of Major Collaborations, told The Daily Mail Australia it’s a ‘very exciting time’ with overwhelming interest in the prototype and the possible capabilities of 3D printing. Scroll down for video . Breakthrough: The 3D printer attracted interest of major manufacturers while on display at the Avalon International Air show in Melbourne, Australia. Scientists call it additive manufacturing but to you and I, its 3D laser printing. Most people are aware of how plastic printers work, the printer head runs back and forth dribbling plastic ink along the page, for metal printing it’s a whole different ball game. Engineers start with a bed of fine powder which is laid down in a very thin base (40 micrometers). Once there is a uniform layer, a laser is used to melt the powder where they want to form a solid part of the structure. From there it’s only several thousand more layers of powder to go down before the product is complete. Dirty work: The 3D printing process involves layers of very fine powder before a laser is used to form the solid structure . Project leader and visionary, Professor Xinhua Wu, says most jet engines are very complex, taking up to 6-24 months to produce. ‘The benefit of 3D printing is we can cut down the manufacture time of those components to 1-2 weeks,’ says Professor Wu. ‘Simple or complex- 3D printing doesn’t care, it produces it in the same time’ Final product: Professor Xinhua Wu(pictured above) with the 3D printing innovation . Although Amaero are the owners of the biggest 3D printer in the world they say its unlikely the device would be used to print whole planes as it’s ideally suited to ‘highly complex and high value adding components.’ For this reason Dr Lyster can't see 3D printing is  replace mass produced products. Dr Lyster told the Daily Mail Australia manufacturing turn around for smaller components will significantly reduce as process’ that once took up to 13 different manufacturing steps and 5-6 months to complete could be produced in as little as three stages and only five days. A laser meticulously melts away at each layer to produce the printed engine . Not only do we ‘improve functioning and decrease manufacturing cost,’ there is a huge reduction in waste as around 99-100% of the powder used ends up being used in the final product, unlike metal which ‘often ends up on the workshop floor,’ says Dr Lyster. ‘People are only just getting around the flexibility 3D printing provides,’ Dr Lyster says. The research team set up spin off company Amaero two years ago, with a federal grant from Commercialisation Australia, to allow the manufacturing on Australian shores. Lyster says the company’s relationship with multiple tier one air space companies has bought them to the forefront of strategic innovation, with the next challenge to establish Amearo as a world leader in 3D printing. “A number of our companies really believe we can do what we are doing better than anyone else,” Dr Lyster told the Daily Mail Australia. Researchers watch on as the printer produces several thousand layers to create aerospace components . The sky is NOT the limit with Lyster’s sights set on entering the biomedical science sphere. Amaero is currently working with Australian and Chinese hospitals and staff looking for new and innovative ways of incorporating 3D printing into the medical world. ‘Demand for product development is so high Amaero is going to have to look at expanding,’ says Lyster. He says now Amaero has comfortably made a mark in the aero industry he is very keen to start working with Australian manufacturers to expand into different industries like biomedical. ‘Our challenge now is engaging with the Australian community and exite them about the capabilities of the technology.'","Monash University have 3D printed the first ever jet engine .

"Loretta Lynch won approval from a key Senate committee Thursday to serve as the nation's next attorney general, as divided Republicans clashed over her support for President Barack Obama's immigration policies. The 12 to 8 vote in the Judiciary Committee sent Lynch's nomination to the full Senate. Lynch is a career prosecutor who is currently the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. Three Republicans – Orrin Hatch of Utah, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina – joined all none committee Democrats in voting 'yes.' Attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday but her fate in the full Senate could be a squeaker . THE 'LYNCH' MOB? Republican senators Orrin Hatch of Utah, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina all voted to confirm Obama's pick for the top job at the Justice Department . 'The case against her nomination, as far as I can tell, essentially ignores her professional career and focuses solely on about six hours that she spent before this committee,' Hatch said as he criticized fellow Republicans for using Lynch's testimony in support of Obama's executive actions on immigration as a reason to oppose her nomination. Timing is uncertain, but Lynch is all but assured approval by the full Senate as well, under new rules that will require only a majority vote of 51 instead of the 60-vote margin required for most legislation. But she appears unlikely to win confirmation resoundingly, as Thursday's debate demonstrated that many Republicans will oppose her over Obama's executive actions granting work permits and deportation stays for millions of immigrants in the United States illegally. 'We should not confirm someone to that position who intends to continue that unlawful policy,' said Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions. Lynch, 55, now serves as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. She would replace Eric Holder, the nation's longest-serving attorney general, and become the first black woman to hold the top law enforcement job. At her Jan. 28 confirmation hearing, Lynch sought to smooth interactions with Republicans, who have repeatedly clashed with Holder, by emphasizing her determination for a 'new and improved' relationship. But Senate Republicans delayed a scheduled vote on her nomination two weeks ago in order to further scrutinize Lynch's record, in particular her support of the Obama immigration plan and a settlement she forged with HSBC Holdings PLC in 2012 over money-laundering allegations. Republicans have criticized Lynch for not probing the bank further over tax evasion at the time her office negotiated a$1.2 billion accord with them. Since her hearing, a Texas district court has thrown Obama's executive order on immigration into legal limbo and HSBC has come under fire over allegations it helped clients evade taxes in their home countries. Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said after the vote that he feared Lynch will not be independent of the White House, a problemthe GOP has articulated often against Holder. 'The current Attorney General has permitted politics to drive decision making far too often. For that reason, the question for me has been whether Ms. Lynch will make a clean break and take the Department of Justice in a new direction,' said Grassle, who voted against her. 'After thoroughly reviewing Ms. Lynch’s testimony, both before the committee and in written follow-up questions, I remain unconvinced she will lead the department in a different direction.'","Loretta Lynch passed her first test by a 12-8 vote, with three of 11 Republicans joining all nine Democrats on the panel .

"Samsung's Galaxy S6 is expected to appear in a radical Edge version with curved screens when it is unveiled on Sunday, while the standard version looks like an iPhone 6. Leaks have shown the final design of Samsung's handset following months of speculation. Both phones will be revealed at a special event in Barcelona before the Mobile World Congress begins there on Monday. Scroll down for video . Samsung's new Galaxy S6 handsets are revealed in this image, it has been claimed. is expected to appear in a radical Edge version with curved screens when it is unveiled on Sunday, while the standard version looks like an iPhone 6. Previous leaks said the Galaxy S6 will feature a Quad HD 5.5-inch display. Other reports claim the screen will measure a smaller 5.1 inches. It is expected to have an octa-core processor and 16MP rear-facing camera. More recent rumours suggest the firm will also unveil an Edge version of its flagship phone. The S6 Edge is said to have a curved screen that covers both sides. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge. Both handsets are expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress on 1 March. The images were posted to the xda-developer website. No other information about the handsets was posted. Another user also posted pictures of the standard version of the handset on the same forum. 'Can't say where it's from but it's from AT&T directly,' the poster said. 'Obviously a prototype or test model and it says not for sale on the package. 'Obviously a phone, I was scared to play with it much but seems a glass back and front with metal on the sides.' 'Our source, who has seen Samsung's new devices in person, tells us that the mid-level 64GB curved Galaxy S6 will cost carriers €949 ($1,076), with the top-end 128GB model priced at €1,049 ($1,189)—around €50 more expensive than the comparable iPhone 6 Plus.' The same source also said the firm is having yield issues for the curved display, which could mean the handset is in very short supply when it launches. Reports claim the ground breaking handset could be prohibitively expensive - and that Samsung is struggling to make the screen. According to a source at one of Samsung's mobile carrier partners in Europe who spoke to Ars Technica under the condition of anonymity, Samsung is launching both the curved and normal Galaxy S6 at high price points. The Standard version of Samsung's Galaxy S6, which will be revealed on Sunday. The firm has been showing off the curved screen in teaser adverts, but is believed to be struggling to manufacture them in large quantities. For the non-curved Galaxy S6, European pricing is €749 ($849), €849 ($963), and €949 ($1,076) for the 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB models respectively - $100 cheaper than the curved version. The site warns that these high prices could dent the phone's popularity. 'The pricing of both the normal and curved versions of the Galaxy S6, however—if carriers pass the price hike onto consumers—could be problematic unless the hardware is truly sensational.' Samsung is set to unveil the handset in Barcelona on March 1st. The Galaxy Edge will have curved screens on each side, and the Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. Created by designes Ivo Marić and Jermaine Smit, the new renders show both expected versions - a standard one and an 'Edge' with both sides having curved displays. Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge. However, the S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right-handed mode . Users will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them. Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The handsets are also set to include wireless charging capabilities. And now the Korean firm has heavily implied the device - or multiple new devices - will come with wireless charging built-in. Many current phones need specially-designed cases and accessories to charge wirelessly, but Samsung's next-generation models could add the feature within the handset on a single chip. In a blog post by Seho Park, principal engineer in Samsung Electronics' IT and mobile division wrote: '2015 will be a landmark year for the growth of wireless charging. The S6 is expected to look similar to Apple's iPhone 6 handset . It will also include a rumoured 20 megapixel camera . 'With our upcoming Galaxy smartphones, users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before.' The use of the plural 'smartphones' adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. These are expected to be the Samsung Galaxy S6, and the S6 Edge that is rumoured to have a curved screen that covers both sides. Until now, many phones and other products have predominantly used the 'magnetic-inductive' method of charging. This involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers. There are three wireless charging organisations including the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), and its Qi standard, the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP). Samsung is a member of all three groups. This means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use, and not every standard is supported across different charging points, for example. However, last year, components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in January, the PMA and A4WP announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features. The S6 won't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the Nokia Lumia 920 already offers this feature - but the Lumia 920 runs on the Qi standard.

Samsung's next Galaxy phones are, however, expected to be the first to support multiple standards on a built-in chip. This means they will be more versatile to take advantage of public charging ports being introduced across retailers such as McDonalds and Starbucks. It will also beat main rival Apple to introducing the technology. Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its original curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. The use of the plural 'smartphones' in the blog post adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. Samsung's invite (pictured) hints at a curved device and the firm is expected to announced the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge . The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi.

"With a net worth of $72.8billion, business magnate Warren Buffett could indulge in a daily diet of caviar and champagne. But the billionaire investor shuns luxury food and drink, insisting in an interview this week the only way to stay young and sharp is to eat like a six-year-old. At the age of 84, the world's second richest man has admitted he drinks at least five cans of Coca-Cola day, enjoys chocolate-chip ice cream for breakfast and will often carry a tube of Potato Stix around with him. Eat and drink like a six-year-old: Warren Buffett, 84, (pictured in 2010) insists the way he stays young and sharp is by consuming 2,700 calories a day including five cans of Coca-Cola . He told Fortune magazine: 'I'm one quarter Coca-Cola. If I eat 2,700 calories a day, a quarter of that is Coca-Cola. I drink at least five 12-ounce servings. I do it everyday. 'I have three Cokes during the day and two at night.' The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway drinks regular Coke at the company's headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska, but at home, he will treat himself to Cherry Coke. The philanthropist owns $16billion in stock with Coca-Cola and has even considered buying the company who produce the Potato Stix - Utz. The reasoning behind his diet is that he believes it is the healthiest way to live. 'I checked the actuarial tables, and the lowest death rate is among six-year-olds,' he said. 'So I decided to eat like a six-year-old. It's the safest course I can take.' It seems that Buffett's eating habits aren't new. In 2008 he reportedly mulled over an investment in Goldman Sachs while snacking on Cheetos and licorice pastel candies. During an interview with the New Yorker in 2012, he ate a hamburger and fries and ordered vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup for dessert. He said: 'I like today what I liked fifty years ago... I haven’t acquired a lot of new habits. I was happy when I was in my twenties, and I don’t see a reason to change things.' In 2009, he revealed his favorite restaurant is Piccolo Pete's in Omaha - a family restaurant which specializes in ribs. One of the venue's waitresses told CNBC he always finishes with a root beer float and he never orders vegetables. Buffett also highlighted his disdain for green food in his biography, The Snowball. He told writer Alice Schroeder: 'Broccoli, asparagus, and Brussels sprouts look to me like Chinese food crawling around on a plate. Cauliflower almost makes me sick. I eat carrots reluctantly. 'I don't like sweet potatoes. I don't even want to be close to a rhubarb, it makes me retch.' Buffett's daily diet was questioned by a New Jersey nutritional dentist in 2009 who urged him to eat healthier foods. However he defended his choices, telling the Omaha Herald World:  My diet, though far from standard, is somewhat better than usually portrayed. I have a wonderful doctor who nudges me in your direction every time I see him. 'All in all, I’ve enjoyed remarkably good health — largely because of genes, of course — but also, I think, because I enjoy life so much every day.' Staying young: The business magnate, who this year celebrates 50 years as the CEO of Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway, has also admitted he eats ice cream for breakfast and carries round a tube of Potato Stix . A year earlier he said there is a choice between not eating bad food and exercising. He chose exercising because it is the 'lesser of two evils'. This year Buffett celebrates 50 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, and it seems his bizarre eating habits haven't affected his appetite to make more money. Last week he snatched up Detlev Louis Motorrad-Vertriebs, a German motorcycle equipment manufacturer. The deal was worth 400 million euros ($456 million), according to Bloomberg News. Detlev Louis sells helmets, motorbike clothing and accessories in more than 70 stores in Germany and Austria, as well as online. The company's headquarters will remain in Hamburg, the law firm said. 'We're probably going to buy a small business in Europe. But I'd love to buy big ones,' he told FOX Business. Buffett's company typically focuses on acquisitions in the United States. In the automobile sector, Berkshire Hathaway announced in October it was buying the Van Tuyl Group, the nation's largest privately owned auto dealership and the fifth largest of all dealership groups, for more than $8 billion. The storied investor also lent $303 million in 2009 to Harley-Davidson to help the stricken US motorcycle maker stay in business during the recession. In August, his company's shares reached $200,000 for the first time.","The 84-year-old admitted he drinks at least five cans of Coca-Cola a day .

"A grieving couple were sent a text asking them to rate their son's A&E experience from the hospital two days after he died of a stroke. John Wood, 71, and his wife Patricia, 68, from Garforth, West Yorkshire, were sorting through the belongings of their son Darren, who collapsed and died earlier this month, aged 42. But two days later they were sent a text message on their deceased son's phone asking him to rate his stay at A&E and how likely they are to recommend the hospital's services to others. Darren Wood suffered a massive stroke and died at Leeds St James's Hospital last month at the age of 42 . The message also asked them to rate the service with a number between one and six, depending on the quality of care. Darren, a 42-year-old pipe fitter, was speaking to a flatmate at his shared house when he suffered a massive stroke and was rushed to Leeds St James's Hospital. He was put on a life support machine but died later that night on February 3. Retired Mr Wood said: 'His housemate said he just went blank all of a sudden and she said ""are you alright, Darren?"" Two days after his death his parents were sent a text from the hospital on his phone asking for feedback on his stay and the quality of care received . 'Then he keeled over and the landlord, who is an old friend of mine, rang me to tell me that my Darren was on the floor. 'When we got to hospital he was on a life support machine and wasn't breathing on his own. 'The staff who worked on Darren were fantastic and did everything they could for him and kept us informed.' He added: 'We're devastated and I'm just trying to come to terms with losing my son and trying to get through everything and get the all the paperwork out of the way. 'It's been a difficult time but we are together so it's easier when there's two of us. 'You feel empty when you lose someone and when you get a text message like that and it just takes your breath away. 'I want this stopped and don't want it to happen to any other people. It could push someone over the edge and they're already dealing with the loss of someone close to them. 'It's the non-medical staff and the disgusting bureaucracy of the NHS that's the problem.' Darren, who suffered from high blood pressure, had been working on renovation works at the hospital where he died until he was let go in late January. Mr Wood added: 'Everyone who met Darren and worked with him said what a lovely guy he was and how hard he worked. 'He'd just had to sign on but had received a couple of job offers so thinks were really looking up for him. 'He wasn't a materialistic guy and never wanted anything, just enough to get by with and he loved his films and quizzes on TV.' Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has since apologised for sending the message, which is used to gain feedback on services. An Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust spokesman said: 'We are extremely sorry for the added distress this text message caused the Wood family following their tragic bereavement. 'This message should not have been sent and we have recently spoken to Mr John Wood to apologise in person and to reassure him that we are looking into how this happened as we want to prevent another family being upset in this way.' John Wood (left) and his wife Patricia say they have been left 'devastated' by the sudden loss of their son . A stroke is a brain attack which happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. It can be caused by a blockage in one of the blood vessels leading to the brain or a bleed in the brain. Strokes affect people in different ways, depending on the part of the brain that is affected, how widespread the damage is and how healthy the person was before the stroke. A stroke can affect the way the body functions as well as your thought processes and how you feel and communicate. Recognising the signs of a stroke can be identified using the FAST test - Face, Arm, Speech, Time.
