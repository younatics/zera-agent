A police officer was paid £10,000 compensation after falling off a chair on London Underground premises, it was revealed today. In total Transport for London has been forced to pay out £4.76million to people injured on tube trains, buses and train station platforms across the capital over the last three years. Details of the award to the British Transport Police officer were released after it emerged Norfolk Police officer Kelly Jones is suing a petrol station owner for £50,000 because she allegedly tripped while responding to a 999 call. Compensation claim: WPC Kelly Jones is suing a petrol station owner for £50,000 after tripping while responding to a 999 call in Thetford, Norfolk . The WPC was condemned by Phil Gormley, her force's own chief constable, when it emerged she was taking action against garage owner Steve Jones in Theftford, Norfolk. It has also been revealed a Grampian Police officer was paid £108,000 after being hurt by a pair of handcuffs while Surrey Police officer PC Richard Seymour launched legal action against a burglary victim after allegedly falling into a drain while investigating a break-in. Details of the payment made to the transport police officer were released following a freedom of information request made by the Liberal Democrats. Transport for London paid out a total of £11,575 to the officer in 2012, although that final bill includes their own legal costs. The biggest overall compensation payout made by the authority since 2010 was £158,584 given to somebody who tripped up over a pillar on a pavement. A blind person was given £34,030 after being caught in an automatic door, £15,168 was given to somebody who had their elbow trapped in a Tube train, and a . would-be traveller was given £10,050 after a seat on a platform collapsed. Councillor Anood Al-Samerai, leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Southwark Council, condemned the payments and said the compensation culture has 'gone mad'. 'These are extraordinary figures which yet again show we're living in a compensation culture gone mad,' she said. Payout: £11,575 was paid to a British Transport Police officer who fell off a chair on the London Underground in 2012. The figure includes Transport for London's own legal costs . 'If somebody is seriously injured and TfL is at fault then clearly there is a need for compensation to cover medical bills and time off work. 'But with so many large claims going through the system, I would question why TfL aren't saving themselves some big payouts by upgrading safety standards for travellers. 'Londoners spend a lot of money on bus and Tube fares. They want to know it's being used to invest in a modern public transport system, not going up the wall on hundreds of expensive compensation payouts.' Among the other payments, £35,566 was given to someone who slipped on a wet platform while a traveller who tripped over a raised manhole cover was given £30,600. Someone who slipped on a wet floor was paid £20,011 and £13,281 was paid out to someone who slipped on a wet mat when entering a station. A person who was hit by a bus was paid £27,245 in 2011. Jill Collis, London Underground’s Director of Health, Safety and Environment, said: 'We have an excellent and improving safety record. Out of well over a billion passenger journeys last year, 435 resulted in a compensation claim – some of which were subsequently not pursued, were rejected or closed at no cost. This equates to one claim from every 2,298,850 journeys. 'However, we are not complacent, and are continually working to further improve safety on the network – including the highest standards of staff training, a rigorous maintenance regime and a wide range of activity to remind people to take care when on the network.'","£4.76million paid out to people injured on London transport over three years .

Joshua Dean Wilson, 23, of Harrogate, is wanted by North Yorkshire Police as they believe he may have information about the student's death . Police are looking for a man after a female university student was found dead. Officers say they want to speak to 23-year-old Joshua Dean Wilson after the body of a 24-year-old woman was discovered in an upmarket spa town. Harrogate police were called to the rear of a semi-detached house where they found a body. Today officers said they needed to speak to Mr Wilson, who lives in the town, who they believe saw the woman shortly before she died. Post-mortem results have so far proved inconclusive and they are treating the death of as unexplained. The young woman is believed to have been a student at Leeds University. Detective Chief Inspector Andrea Kell, said: 'We are treating the woman's death as unexplained at this time and it is vital that we piece together her final movements. 'Our investigations so far reveal that Mr Wilson was one of the last people to see her alive and it is vital that he gets in touch with us. 'I am appealing to Mr Wilson to contact us without delay along with anyone who knows of his current whereabouts or has any information which could help our investigation.' The woman's body was found behind Brandon Lodge, a house of six flats in Harrogate's Lancaster Park road.  The house is said by neighbours to be owned by a local housing association, where residents tend not to stay too long. One neighbour said he saw a policeman 'on a mission' running towards the stone property on Wednesday, the day the body was discovered. He told MailOnline: 'We saw one policeman running like mad, his helmet under his arm, going down our street and trying to get through to the back of Brandon Lodge. 'I said to my family ""He looks like he's on a mission"", and the next we knew all hell broke loose, with police cars, an ambulance, and the house being cordoned off.' Police found the body of a 24-year-old female student behind this building in the leafy spa town of Harrogate on Wednesday . He said the property caused endless problems in an otherwise smart street. 'Just at the weekend there were . people from inside chasing each other with a fire extinguisher, and . we've had an arsonist, a flasher, a prostitute and endless drugs . problems - not a week goes by without the police visiting the house. 'If a private landlord ran their property like that, they'd be closed down.  It's scandalous.' A police spokesperson said: 'We are not yet in a position to release the name of the deceased, however she is believed to be a student from Leeds University.' A spokesman for Leeds University said he was still trying to corroborate the report that the young woman was a student there, but he said there were no university buildings or lodgings in Harrogate.","Joshua Dean Wilson, of Harrogate, may have seen woman before she died .

A man held on suspicion of attempting to kidnap a three-year-old British girl as she enjoyed a family holiday has been released on police bail. The child was led away from her parents and taken down an alleyway while her family looked round a shopping centre in the Spanish island resort of Lanzarote. The girl's father shouted out and ran up to his daughter, pulling her away from the man who then left the scene. A 62-year-old man from London was . arrested by police on Wednesday on suspicion of the attempted . kidnap of the child, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, following a media appeal. Location: A family from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, were on holiday in Costa Teguise when a man, believed to be British, attempted to kidnap the girl in a shop . Police confirmed today that he has been released on bail until next month. The . incident has chilling similarities to the disappearance of . three-year-old Madeleine McCann, who went missing from her apartment in . Portugal in 2007 and has never been seen since. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'A 62-year-old man from London arrested in connection with an attempted kidnap in Lanzarote has been released on police bail. 'The man has been bailed to return to Milton Keynes Police Station in early May. 'The arrest is in connection with an incident in the resort of Costa Teguise on Monday 30 January, when a three-year-old girl was led away from her family in a shopping centre.' The British girl's family were on the beach a short . time after the shopping centre incident and saw the same man, who spoke fluent English, sitting . between some rocks and acting suspiciously. The victim’s father confronted the suspect, but he left before police arrived. But the quick-thinking family took photos of the man in an attempt to identify him. The middle-aged man was described as white, with pasty skin, of . stocky build with broad shoulders. He was around 5ft 8ins to 5ft 9ins tall, 40 to 55 years old, with short dark hair and a dark moustache. Similarities: Madeleine McCann, left, pictured just before she disappeared in 2007, and a computer generated image of how she may look now . The incident happened on January . 30 last year, but police said the delay in . issuing the pictures was due to Spanish police having to exhaust their . investigation before the appeal to find the man could move to Britain. A near six-year search for Madeleine . has yet to solve the mystery of her disappearance from the Algarve . resort of Praia da Luiz on May 3, 2007. There . have been dozens of alleged sightings and leads over the years, but . nothing has come close to establishing whether she is alive or dead.

A young teacher has revealed that she was attacked by a murderer on her way home from a night out - but managed to save her own life by befriending the vicious killer. Jessica Price was assaulted in the street by Carl Powell, who attempted to strangle her and dragged her to a remote spot to kill her. But she started talking to him and shared a cigarette, convincing him not to harm her and escaping unhurt. After the 23-year-old called police to report her ordeal, she learned that he had killed another young woman in almost identical circumstances just a month earlier. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Jessica Price, left, was attacked by Carl Powell, right, but managed to convince him not to kill her . CCTV: The pair could be seen struggling on the streets of Nottingham in August 2011 . Altercation: Ms Price sweet-talked Powell into releasing her by making him think she was flirting . Powell, 24, who confessed to being a . career criminal during his conversation with Ms Price, was jailed for . life in October for murdering mother of two Caroline Coyne. Ms . Price, who works as a teacher in Italy, was walking through Nottingham . city centre after a night out with friends in August 2011. Because the streets were deserted, she was unable to call for help when Powell approached her and physically overpowered her. So instead, she started a conversation with him, asking him about his life and convincing him she was trying to flirt. 'I've always been good at talking,' she said this week while recounting the attack. 'This time my talent saved my life.' She . faced her would-be killer again last week when she agreed to testify at . his trial for the murder of Ms Coyne, overcoming her fears in order to . secure justice for the young mother. Struggle: But Ms Price calmed him down and they later walked hand-in-hand down the road . Brave: Ms Price has waived her anonymity to speak out and condemn the murderer . 'Being a key witness in a murder trial was nerve wrecking, but I knew I wasn't just there for me,' Ms Price said. She had recently returned from travelling overseas and was enjoying a reunion with friends on the night of the attack. Although . the evening did not wrap up until 3am, she decided to walk the 40 . minutes to the family home alone, as she was very familiar with the . route. She listened to . her iPod on the walk, but when she noticed a stranger catching up with . her she turned down the volume in order to be on the alert. Ms Price decided to ask Powell for the time, in order to distract him in case he was planning to attack. Victim: It emerged that Powell had previously murdered Caroline Coyne, pictured with her baby son . However, seconds later he lunged at her, wrapping his hands around her neck and throttling her. 'I couldn't breathe at all,' she said. 'I was terrified. I struggled, but as hard as I tried, I couldn't pull his hands away. He was too strong. 'With the little breath I had left inside me, I managed to say ""please"" but he kept on telling me to shut up. I thought that was it. I just thought I was going to die.' Although Powell flung Ms Price to the . floor, leaving her mobile phone out of reach, she maintained her . composure and got the attacker to sit next to her. 'In . that situation, I always thought that I would be really nice and really . calm,' she continued. 'If I could get the person on side, then they . might reconsider. So, that was my plan. When he took his hands off me, I . stayed quiet. Catching my breath, I managed to tell him I wouldn't make . a sound, and he took a step back. That's when I knew my plan was . working. 'I told him . he could take whatever he wanted. I didn't have any money, but I offered . him my iPod. He said to me, ""Do I look like I need money?"" He had this . arrogant swagger about him. He told me he didn't know what he wanted. 'I . don't usually smoke, but when he lit a cigarette I asked for a drag, if . only so he could see I had something in common with him.' Now that Powell had calmed down, Ms Price began to talk to him and asked him about himself. 'I . said, ""You should have just said something to me if you wanted to . talk."" His whole attitude began to change as he started chatting with . me. He even ran out to snatch my bag back from the street. 'I . was asking where he had been in town. Just something to keep him . occupied. I needed to convince him everything was fine. There was no way . I could have run - he was blocking my exit and I'm not fast at the best . of times. 'He even . apologised for scaring me. After a while, I just said to him, ""Look, . you're headed in the same direction as me. Let's walk together"".' He clutched her hand as they started . walking back up to the main road, with Mr Price making a mental note of . where Powell dropped his cigarette butt. She . persuaded him to take his hood down, saying she wanted to see his face - . and ensuring she would be able to identify him after his arrest. Horror: But Ms Price agreed to testify at Powell's trial in an attempt to win justice for Ms Coyne . 'Anyone . who saw us would have assumed we were a couple but I was desperate to . get away,' she said. 'I was still keeping him talking. I asked how he . made his money. He said, ""Mostly naughty stuff."" 'He . was holding my hand and trying to kiss me. I'm sure he was convinced . that he had pulled me. When he leaned in to kiss me, I pulled away and . he said, ""I thought you had forgiven me?"" 'I . told him I needed to get home as my mum would be frantic. Then he said . to me, ""At least feel what you're doing to me,"" and he shoved my hand . down his trousers. I squirmed as he smiled.' Powell . received a phone call, which gave Ms Price an excuse to leave - but she . agreed to exchange numbers with him to keep up the pretence of . friendship . She immediately phoned home to her mother, and told her to call the police if she hadn't returned within five minutes. After . getting home, she phoned 999 and reported her encounter to police, who . quickly connected it to the murder of 28-year-old Ms Coyne a month . earlier. The care assistant had, like Ms Price, been walking through Nottingham late at night when she failed to return home. Her body was found in an alley between two houses, and officials determined she had been strangled then bludgeoned to death. 'The detectives explained how Caroline had been killed and how they believed that my attacker was the killer,' Ms Price said. 'I could have been his next victim. After he attacked me and when I got him talking, it felt like he was backing down from something.' Police were able to match DNA from the cigarette butt to Powell, and he was convicted of murder a year later at Nottingham Crown Court. Ms Price came face-to-face with her attacker during his trial, and burst into tears when he was found guilty of sexual assault, false imprisonment and murder. 'I flew back from Italy for the trial,' she said. 'It was nerve-wrecking, but I knew why I was there - for me and for Caroline. Giving evidence behind a screen was an option, but I decided against it. I wasn't afraid of him. 'I'd been waiting over a year for justice and at last I could move on.'","Jessica Price, 23, was attacked by Carl Powell on way home from night out .

A grandmother killed herself after she was forced to leave a care home because of NHS cost-cutting. An inquest found there were 'failures at every level' in the care of Sheila McInulty, 65, who died from a lethal overdose of prescription medication in February 2011 after managers ignored the advice of psychiatrists and removed her from the Mountview recovery unit in Northwood. Ms McInulty, of Edgware, west London, was suffering with a mental health condition and had repeatedly attempted suicide, the Harrow Times reported. Mountview Care Home, where Ms McInulty was given two days notice before being told to leave . A psychiatrist report recommended extended rehabilitation for the grandmother, with the aim that she would be able to return home. But a funding decision by NHS Barnet and Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust meant that Mrs McInulty was released early. North London coroner's court as told that the mother-of-three died after a string of failures by managers who passed responsibility for funding her care from NHS Barnet to Harrow council in order to save costs. In July 2009, after a review of the minicab manager's health, she was transferred from a Barnet care home to Mountview residential care home, where her condition improved. But in September 2010 a funding assessment decided that she would be transferred from the health trust to the Harrow Borough Council as it was mistakenly believed she had social care needs. In November she was given just two days' notice to leave Mountview despite a review nine days earlier in which a psychiatrist said she presented 'an ongoing significant risk' of another overdose. Clinical staff told the NHS commissioning manager the move was not in her interest, might cause harm and interrupt rehabilitation but the decision was not changed and Mrs McInulty was sent home to an empty house as her husband was working away from home. North West London NHS Foundation Trust said that it had reviewed its processes . Although at first she coped well, her condition deteriorated and she committed suicide the following February. Her daughter, Marie Coulter, 44, a legal secretary, said 'I'm angry, I'm upset, I'm heartbroken and I'm devastated,' the Evening Standard reported. Coroner Andrew Walker, who delivered a narrative verdict, said: 'This represented a significant failure on the part of the individuals involved in the process and was the beginning of a chain of events that led to and directly caused Mrs McInulty's death.' Central and North West London Foundation Trust - working on behalf of Harrow Council - was also criticised for not allowing the office manager to remain in the care home when it became responsible for her care, Barnet Today reported. Mr Walker said: 'There were failures at every level in this process. The two care workers present (at her assessment) did not understand the process.' The inquest was told that no supporting documents were gathered for the assessment and that a decision document that had been completed earlier had been lost and not rewritten. Barnet clinical commissioning group — previously the Barnet primary care trust — has apologised to Mrs McInulty’s family, the Evening Standard reported. A spokesman for the NHS agencies involved said that it had agreed an action plan to ensure that lessons were learned. A spokesman for Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust said that it had reviewed its processes.

Bestselling novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford today paid tribute to Baroness Thatcher, saying she was a 'rock star' who 'saved Britain' and became the greatest peacetime Prime Minister of the modern era. The author of A Woman of Substance described a run-in she had with the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street, as she was admiring a painting of Winston Churchill. Mrs Bradford told Mrs Thatcher: 'As a little girl growing up, I could never have imagined that one day I would come to Number 10 and stand here looking at the portrait of Winston Churchill.' The Prime Minister replied: 'I know what you mean, Mrs Bradford - neither did I.' Tribute: Margaret Thatcher was a 'rock star', according to bestselling novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford (right) 'Feminine': The author described Lady Thatcher as 'tough, but in an elegant way' and praised her dress sense . The acclaimed writer is one of hundreds of public figures to share their memories of Lady Thatcher since her death on Monday at the age of 87. The great Prime Minister's ceremonial funeral will be held at St Paul's Cathedral next Wednesday, and the Queen will be among the guests. Mrs Bradford, 79, told MailOnline: 'She was a star... today they would call her a rock star! I rather think she was exactly that.' As well as praising the political instincts of Britain's first female leader, Mrs Bradford paid tribute to her 'female practicality and common sense'. 'The woman who saved Britain': Mrs Bradford called for the former Prime Minister to have a state funeral . She said: 'I think she was tough, but in an elegant way. She was one of the most feminine women I have ever met. 'She loved clothes, shoes handbags and jewellery. I’ve always admired her for that, and for owning up to it. Power in a lovely dress... A Woman Of Substance indeed.' The author was introduced to Mrs Thatcher by Irwin Bellow, the chairman of Leeds City Council who helped forge the Prime Minister's signature policy of selling off council houses. He arranged for Mrs Bradford and her husband Robert to attend a cocktail party at Number 10 for leading figures in the arts.

'I stepped to one side, and caught a glimpse of an oil painting of my great hero, Winston Churchill. 'Edging away from the group, I went and peeped around the door. This opened onto a small landing, and hanging over a downward-spiralling staircase was that huge portrait of the great man. 'A moment later I heard that inimitable voice, asking cordially, ""Are you all right, Mrs Bradford?"" 'I swung around to face Margaret Thatcher. ""I am, thank you, Prime Minister,"" I said. ""I was just standing here, thinking that as a little girl growing up I could never have imagined that one day I would come to Number 10 and stand here looking at the portrait of Winston Churchill."" '""I know what you mean, Mrs Bradford - neither did I,"" she answered me with a twinkle in her eyes. As we walked back into the reception, she told me how much she had enjoyed my book, and I congratulated her on being the first woman to become Prime Minister.'

Morgan celebrated news of the response . Wednesday by tweeting, 'BREAKING NEWS: President Obama has officially . decided I am NOT being deported.' Carney's response came after the petition, which was started on . the White House website, had gathered more than four times the requirement to warrant an official . response from the administration. The petition was started in response to an . interview on Morgan's show in which he called Larry Pratt of Gun Owners . for America an 'idiot,' 'dangerous' and 'an unbelievably stupid man' after Pratt argued that more guns could reduce crime. In another debate on gun controls, . Morgan shouted down economist John Lott, author of More Guns, Less Crime . and branded him a liar for claiming gun crime trends in countries such . as Britain supported his thesis. Fiery: Morgan spars with radio host Alex Jones over his opinions on gun control . The comments outraged gun owners across the U.S., who called for Morgan to be deported. Launched on December 21 through a . White House web tool called 'We the People,' the petition accuses Morgan . of engaging in a 'hostile attack against the U.S. Consitution' by . targeting the Second Amendment and 'exploiting his position as a . national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of .

'If we work harder to keep guns out . of the hands of dangerous people, there would be fewer atrocities like . the one in Newtown,' Obama says, 'or any of the lesser-known tragedies . that visit small towns and big cities all across America every day.'","Petition had gathered more than 109,000 signatures, more than four times the amount required for an official response from the White House .

The young girl was alone in her room with a 16-year-old boy at around 8.30pm when the teen tried to kiss and embrace her, police said. What's in a name? A mother from suburban Philadelphia named Honey Love is accused of leading a small mob to punish a teen who had allegedly assaulted her daughter . Tough love: Police say the 35-year-old woman armed her 11-year-old son with a pair of steak knives in preparation for the attack on a 16-year-old boy . Love's daughter tried to push the youngster away, but tripped and fell to the ground. That is when officials say the 16-year-old stood over the girl and pulled down his pants and underwear. At that moment, Miss Love walked into the room and found the half-naked teenage boy with her daughter. The 16-year-old then fled Love's house. When the 35-year-old mother learned what happened, she gathered six people, among them her 11-year-old son armed with a pair of steak knives measuring at 8 and 4 inches in length, and the whole group set out from Love's home on Sunshine Drive to deliver swift justice to the alleged molester. 'Mom took the gang and was going to kick some a**, or cut some a**, one or the other,' Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told Philly.com. Harrowing scene: Love walked into her daughter's room in their home on Sunshine Drive to discover the teen standing over her child not wearing pants or underwear .

When the door opened, all seven intruders went inside, and Love's young son started swinging his two steak knives, according to police. Then, his mother took one of the weapons from the boy's hands and started brandishing it in front of the teen and his family. No injuries have been reported.

A married police constable had sex with his girlfriend in a police van and used the police national computer to track three women to chase, a jury heard today. Twice-married Pc Matthew Fisher, 37, allegedly spent four years coaxing sexual favours from five different women through his role as a police officer, sometimes refusing to take no for an answer, Hull Crown Court heard. He would make flirting remarks, grab their hands and place them on his genitals, and try to look down their top while on pay from North Yorkshire Police, it is alleged. He met two women by offering them lifts home in a police van. Prosecutors claim he looked up the mobile numbers on police databases for three women when he had no professional reason to do so. Fisher, of Selby, is accused of four charges of sexual assault, one charge of attempted rape and a charge of misconduct in public office by accessing the police national computer and using a police radio for personal communication. He denies the charges. He has admitted two charges of misconduct in public office. One relates to having sexual contact in a police van outside of Selby Bus Station. The other relates to having consensual sexual contact with woman he met in while she was on a night out and he gave her a lift home in a police van. Crown barrister Simon Waley told the jury the allegations arose from his work as a police officer in the Selby area and had spiraled from two to four complaints when girls read he had been charged, but some of the sexual contact was consensual. Mr Waley said Fisher would meet the women as victims of crime or patrolling and befriend them before beginning to flirt and offer his sexual services - usually in their own homes. 'He has targeted women he wished to have sexual contact with and in some instances has tracked down their personal details using police information systems,' said Mr Waley. 'With some of these women the sexual contact which followed was consensual (they are not charged). With others he forced his sexual intentions on them, confident in the belief that they wouldn't bring themselves to report him - for example that they had been the victim of an offence that he was there to assist them with or that they had criminal records which made them think that they would never be believed over a police officer or simply that they were drunk, the court heard. 'In each instance he was content to take advantage of those vulnerabilities.' Trial: Fisher has admitted two charges of misconduct in public office. One relates to having sexual contact in a police van outside of Selby Bus Station, pictured . Mr Waley said the first woman would tell the jury she was dependent on heroin and Pc Fisher had gone to a shared flat where she had been drinking to ask her to turn down music. She said he took her home, drunk in his police car and when they reached her address he started some flirtatious conversation . He grabbed her hand to his manhood the woman said she swore at him pulled her hand away and made to get out the car. 'He asked her not to tell anyone and that he was getting engaged soon,' said Mr Waley. The second woman called him to help her after being assaulted by her partner. She said he asked her to demonstrate how she was assaulted. She said Fisher had said: 'You're not wearing any knickers.' She commented she did not think that was very professional. She said he make an excuse to use her toilet and came out into her bedroom with his trousers undone. She told police he grabbed her, pushing her on to a bed, trying to kiss her. 'She was asking him what he was doing and telling him to stop,' said Mr Waley. He told the court Fisher tried to make her perform a sex act after taking off his protective vest. Eventually he gave up and said to her: 'I know things about you, so you're not going to tell on me are you?' Allegations: Fisher, 37, allegedly spent four years coaxing sexual favours from five different women through his role as a police officer, sometimes refusing to take no for an answer, Hull Crown Court heard . Mr Waley said the third woman they would hear from needed police help, after her son was involved in an incident. He made repeated home visits on duty. 'He often made sexual comments to her and she describes him pulling at her top and looking down at her breasts on more than one occasion,' said Mr Waley. 'She said on one occasion Pc Fisher gave her a lift home in a police van and sat of her sofa before unzipping his trousers. She asked him what he was doing as there were children in the house.' She said on a further occasion he had arrived at her home when she was putting make up on ready to go out when he backed her into a kitchen corner. 'He put one hand onto her upper body and with his other hand he took hers and placed it on his groin,' said Mr Waley. 'She pulled her hand away but she had foundation on her hand which left a mark on his trousers.' Mr Waley said the fourth complainant met Fisher on a night out in Selby when he when he pulled up in a police van and offered her a lift home. She was happy to go along with it and gave him her phone number and when they got to her house he kissed her. He used his police radio to call her and Mr Waley said the pair had consensual sexual contact one or two weeks later. 'You should not he has pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office to reflect the fact in the course of his duties he called on this lady to have sexual contact.' Mr Waley said in total Pc Fisher made 52 attempts to contact her using both is police radio and personal mobile. Mr Waley said in March last year Fisher was interviewed about the allegations made by two women and in prepared statement denied he assaulted them in anyway. Enquires were made into Pc Fisher's use of police systems and his personal contacts. Mr Waley said Fisher accessed a police date base for three women - obtaining their personal mobiles and then calling them. 'One has given a statement in which she says that Pc Fisher had admitted he had 'taken the liberty of looking her up' with respect to her number and car details. Mr Waley said Fisher first struck up a relationship with this fifth women he met in a supermarket and had consensual sexual contact with her in a police van outside Selby Bus Station. He said: 'Matthew Fisher has entered a guilty plea to misconduct in public office with having sex in a police van.' Mr Waley said in interview Pc Fisher accepted he had carried out checks, but could not recall details of those checks. When interviewed about the other two women he accepted knowing one as a victim of crime and attended her house on police business, but denied any sexual remarks or misconduct . Instead he said she behaved flirtatiously to him exposing herself and asking him when they would have sexual relations. The trial continues.

Stores have been accused of fooling shoppers by selling copycat versions of big-brand favourites to boost profits. Several products, from breakfast cereals to biscuits and beauty creams, bearing an uncanny resemblance to famous names, have been identified. The tactic has been condemned by consumer champion Which?. It found packs with similar names, shapes, colours and designs that mimic popular products, which manufacturers have spent millions of pounds to develop. The examples include Boots anti-dandruff shampoo, where the white bottle and blue cap and lettering look remarkably similar to Head & Shoulders. Similarly, Boots’ vibrant pink bottle for its Fruit Essence shampoo is remarkably like the one for  Clairol’s popular Herbal Essences. Tesco’s tubes of Chipz look very much like the market leaders Pringles, and the pickled onion Beasty Bites from Asda appear to owe much to the look of packs of Monster Munch. The ruse appears to be designed to either fool busy shoppers into picking up the wrong product or piggy-backing on the reputation for quality of mainstream brands. Research among Which? members found one in five had accidentally bought a supermarket version of a product thinking it was a well-known brand. Of these, 38 per cent said they were annoyed by this and 30 per cent felt misled. The pack design of McVitie's Milk Chocolate Digestives has apparently been copied by Tower Gate digestives sold by Lidl . McVitie’s seems to be a particular target for the copycats. Its well-known Penguin chocolate biscuits found an imitator in the Puffin brand sold by Asda. And the pack design of its Milk Chocolate Digestives has apparently been copied by Tower Gate digestives sold by Lidl. The British Brands Group fights to protect the designs of mainstream products. Director John Noble said: ‘Brands survive by being distinctive and standing out, and retailers are free-riding on brands’ reputations.’ All the shops identified by  Which? insisted they were confident that consumers were not being misled and could tell the difference between branded and own-label products. Stores such as Boots and Aldi said certain colours were synonymous with particular products or active ingredients, helping shoppers find what they are looking for. A Which? spokesman said: ‘Retailers should make sure that people are under no illusions about what they are buying.’","Consumer champion Which? condemns lookalike tactic .

A drug-addicted prostitute has been jailed for terrorising elderly residents on the day she was released from prison. Aisha Delaney, 56, from Hull, was jailed last August for preying on an elderly stroke victim living in a sheltered housing complex. But Delaney, branded ‘demonic’ by police, breached her Asbo by returning to the complex on the day she was freed to resume her campaign of terror. Jailed: Aisha Delaney was jailed for preying on an elderly stroke victim living in a sheltered housing complex, but breached her Asbo by returning to the complex on the day she was freed to resume campaign of terror . Jailing her for seven months, Judge Jeremy Richardson said Delaney’s chaotic existence should act as a warning to young people. He said: 'If ever there was a case where young people on the threshold of taking drugs and leading a bad life, they should meet that woman and see the sort of wretched life she has led and where she has ended up. 'A not unintelligent woman who has fallen in every sense.' As Delaney, who has 119 convictions, was led to the cells to return to prison, she said: 'I’m not a bad person.' Campaign of terror: Delaney caused trouble for residents living in Great Thornton Street in Hull . Delaney was banned from going within 100m of the complex after committing a string of burglaries and thefts against the residents, all in their 80s and 90s. Delaney, was given an antisocial behaviour order last January that banned her from causing alarm and distress in an attempt to stop her terrorising the elderly residents in their homes. However, she has now breached the order for the eighth time, this time returning to the complex just hours after her release from prison on March 28. Delaney got drunk following her release and claimed she was assaulted, robbed and had paint thrown in her face. 'I’m not a bad person' Delaney as she was led away from the court . The court heard she had gone to the sheltered housing complex after dark to look for her husband, who still lives there. Hull City Council’s barrister Kevin Guy said the banning order had been made to protect the elderly people living in fear of her. He said: 'It was made to protect the vulnerable residents. 'She was seen trying to enter the complex just after 10pm on March 28. 'It was clearly a breach of the order as she is well aware she should not be within 100m of there.' Her barrister Paul Genney, who agreed to represent Delaney for free after no other lawyer would take the case, said: 'The problem is this lady is married to Mr Delaney, who still lives in this complex and I’m told he has applied to move. Hull Crown Court: Jailing her for seven months, Judge Jeremy Richardson said Delaney¿s chaotic existence should act as a warning to young people . 'One doesn’t blame the council as I’m told social housing is hard to obtain but the view is because he has accommodation, he is not a priority to be moved. 'She says she didn’t do anything untoward, she simply approached the building because she says she had been beaten up. It was not a happy homecoming.' Delaney was jailed for five months after the Asbo was made last year when police caught her in the complex. She was jailed for 18 months for stealing from an elderly man in the complex last August. 'A not unintelligent woman who has fallen in every sense' Judge Jeremy Richardson . After this, the eighth breach, Judge Richardson QC warned Delaney he would show her no mercy in the future. He said: 'Let there be no misunderstanding, it was a simple condition that required simple compliance. 'The residents of this establishment are in fear when you go anywhere near the property, the staff looking after them are in fear and this is why you must stay away. 'If there is any more of this, there will be no mercy. I’m going to reserve any further breaches to myself. 'I will remember your case and if there is any more of this then I’m afraid it is highly likely you will go to prison for a length well in excess of 12 months. 'You have been warned. I have treated you with some mercy, there will be no mercy on a future occasion.'","Aisha Delaney was jailed last August for preying on elderly stroke victim .

Paul Bodger, 51, was astonished to see that the 'stone' he had dug up with his JCB was in fact his missing tortoise, Sydney . A tortoise that went missing ten months ago has been found alive - after his owner dug up his garden to build a house extension. Paul Bodger had assumed his pet would never be seen again after he went missing from his Cambridgeshire home last June. But when Mr Bodger began digging up his garden to add an extension to his house, they found a tortoise-shaped, mud-covered lump in the soil. Mr Bodger, 51, said: 'We started digging up the land for the foundations of our extension and I was spraying some pesticide on it when I ended up spraying Sydney. 'At first I thought he was a stone - he was absolutely caked in mud.' Sydney, who is five and had been a present to Mr White from his 46-year-old wife in 2011, was last seen in June before he disappeared overnight. Mr Bodger, a blacksmith, and his partner Yvette White, 46, spent a fortnight looking for their the Horse Field tortoise, even calling in a gun dog to see if it could sniff the tortoise out. But when they still could not find Sydney, which Miss White had given her boyfriend as a present in 2011, they assumed he had wandered off for ever. Mr Bodger said: 'He's normally kept in about a 25 or 26 degree controlled environment, in a heated vivarium, and we never let him hibernate. 'So when he got out last June there is every chance he mistook the cool summer for winter and burrowed his way underground. 'That would explain why we couldn't . find him.' Sydney the tortoise was barely recognisable when he was dug up by a JCB ten months after going missing . Mr Bodger shows the mound of earth and rubble his tortoise was extracted from in his Wisbech garden . Happy to be free: Sydney looked as good as new after a wash and a check-up from the vet . Three weeks ago they began digging up their garden so they could lay the foundations for the four-bedroom extension to their home in Wisbech. They dug five feet down with a JCB, and it was in this earth that Sydney was found.  When Mr Bodger realised the mud-covered object was his pet, he initially assumed he must have died. Mr Bodger believes his pet might have struggled to dig himself free without the JCB digging him out. He said: 'I'm amazed how long he has managed to survive for. And I can't believe he survived being dug up by the digger. After 10 months burrowed deep in the chilly Cambridgeshire soil, Sydney is back in his heated vivarium . 'It's a miracle, I suppose. Yvette is over the moon but she is working in London so still hasn't seen him. She is absolutely delighted now.' Mr Bodger has now washed Sydney and returned him to his heated vivarium after his extended winter. He has been checked over by a vet and given the all-clear. Tortoises are known to bury themselves just under the surface of the earth as part of their hibernation pattern.","Sydney the tortoise went missing from his Cambridgeshire home in June .

A thirteen-year-old burglar ransacked a disabled woman's house - killing her pet fish, decapitating her dolls and damaging her wheelchair - a court has heard. The boy, who cannot be named, even smirked while being interviewed by the police about the attack at the home of cerebral palsy sufferer Maria Hill in Cheltenham. Now aged 14, the youngster was . sentenced to 12 months detention and training by magistrates last month . - but today appealed against his sentence at Gloucester Crown Court. Attack: The boy smirked during a police interview about the attack on the home of Maria Hill in Cakebridge Road, Cheltenham . Ms Hill, 33, has been left feeling 'petrified' of continuing to live alone, Gloucester crown court heard. The boy asked the crown court to consider freeing him with a supervision and rehabilitation order. But Recorder Nigel Pascoe QC dismissed the appeal, telling the boy his crime as 'so terrible and so cruel that what you did is more important than the remorse you have since shown and the alternative which is put before the court.' Mr Pascoe said the court did not think magistrates were wrong to impose the sentence they did. 'While we accept you have shown remorse for your behaviour in the letter you have written to us and in the reports on you we have no doubt the sentence was justified.' Errina Foley-Fisher, prosecuting, said Ms Hill left her home in Cakebridge Road, Cheltenham, on December 22 to go to stay with her mother in Cirencester for Christmas. 'The details of what happened are quite disturbing,' she said. 'The defendant smashed an upstairs bedroom window to get in. In that bedroom a mattress was turned upside down, a three foot pine cabinet was thrown to the floor and broken. 'The destruction continued into her own bedroom. Every drawer was opened. Her clothes were thrown around. The wires of her electric disability duvet were cut. Presents of geisha dolls from her mother from her trips to Japan were decapitated. Some of the wrapped Christmas presents she had left in the house were opened and stolen.' Court: The boy appealed against his sentence for the attack at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) - but was told his remorse did not make up for his crime . Ms Foley-Fisher said there were obvious signs in the house that it belonged to a disabled woman, including a wheelchair in the kitchen 'which was overturned and the gearstick broken off.' Two 60-litre fish tanks in the living room were smashed and the majority of the fish had been killed, she said, including one which had been thrown against a wall. There were three stab marks in the TV. 'A knife had also been stabbed into her suitcases. Money, jewellery and stamps were taken,' said Ms Foley-Fisher. Police arrested the boy nearby in the early hours of December 23 and found the stolen property on him, she said. The boy swore at the officers but then admitted that the property came from Ms Hill's house. In a victim impact statement Ms Hill said: 'Prior to this event I have always been a bubbly, outgoing person. I would talk to anybody. I am nice, not malicious in any way because I have been brought up that way.' She said she was distressed by the thought 'that somebody could violate me.' 'I live with a disability, cerebral palsy, which is a challenge. To think that someone could or would do this to me makes you question yourself,' she said. She said she had started questioning the people's nature following the incident, and that it has made her look over her shoulder. Daniel Cavaglieri, defending, conceded that it was 'difficult to imagine an additional aggravating feature that might have occurred' but submitted that the boy had already had a 'salutary lesson' from spending the last five weeks in custody and would now benefit from supervision to try to correct his attitude and behavour.","Youngster smirked during police interview about attack in Cheltenham .

The family of the girl, who was detained in a women's police station alone for a night, is now under police protection amid the threats. Her mother took her to Kotwali women's police station after finding her unconscious in a field. The girl says a 35-year-old neighbour raped her, but the family says they are under pressure to drop the claim and accept a settlement instead. The mother told the Indian Express: 'They have been threatening to kill us, burn down our ancestral home and stone my daughter to death if we do not withdraw the rape case. 'Even the village panchayat (council), including the sarpanch (leader), is in favour of the accused and is asking the family to settle the matter.' An inquiry into why the girl was jailed for the night is underway with four officers from the station, near  Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, suspended. A police superintendent told the Daily Telegraph that the girl's detention was a 'misunderstanding' while the family is under the impression it was to try to make them too scared to pursue the claim. Vaibhav Krishna, who is leading the inquiry into her overnight stay, said a man had been arrested for the alleged rape. But the man, from the Lodhe Rajputs caste, denied the allegation and claimed the girl had been scared after he told her off for picking tomatoes from a neighbour's field, ran away and made the claim.

Disqualified drink driver: Jason Huxtable, 22, pictured arriving at court today, was jailed for six years after killing two of his friends in the late night crash . A disqualified drunk driver who killed two of his friends when he rolled a car down a bank tried to blame one of his friends for the crash as she lay dying next to the burning vehicle. Jason Huxtable, 22, flagged down a passing lorry and tried to hitch a ride home without bothering to mention he had been involved in a serious accident. Young mother Emma Kift, 21, died after being thrown out of the car during the crash while Johnny Popple, 23, was trapped inside as it burned. The fire was so fierce that the vehicle was almost completely destroyed following the crash at Loxhore Cross, near Barnstaple in Devon. Huxtable was jailed for six years at Exeter Crown Court today after admitting two counts of causing death by careless driving while over the drink drive limit. After the crash the construction worker flagged down a passing lorry driver and attempted to get a lift to his home in nearby Bratton Fleming, the court heard. It was only when the lorry driver refused to drive him that Huxtable informed him there had been a crash. The defendant, who was twice the drink drive limit and had been banned . from driving three months earlier, initially said Ms Kift had been at the wheel and showed little concern for his friends, the judge was told. He eventually made a full confession to police following the crash in the early hours of June 1 last year. The three friends agreed Huxtable should drive them to get food in Ms Kift's car because he was 'the most sober'. But the car clipped a . hedge, before 'fish-tailing' down the road and flipping down a bank as the driver sought to correct his vehicle. He had been driving in excess of . the 60mph speed limit. Sentencing today, judge Mr Justice Burnett said: 'At the time of these awful events you simply did not believe the ordinary rules which apply to everyone else applied to you. 'Time and again young lives are lost as a result of the overbearing arrogance and stupidity of young drivers who believe that they are in some way immune to the effects of alcohol and run risks with their own lives and other people’s lives. The consequences of your actions are almost beyond description.' Prosecutor Andrew Macfarlane said the car was completely destroyed in the crash with victim Mr Popple inside. Mr Macfarlane said: 'The fire was so fierce that it burned virtually everything about it, including the tyres. 'Not a lot was left of the body of Mr Popple who perished in the car.' Victim: Young mother Emma Kift, 21, who died in the accident near Barnstaple, Devon, last year . Killed: Johnny Popple, 23, was trapped in the vehicle as it burned, Exeter Crown Court was told . He said Ms Kift had always refused to wear a seatbelt because, the court was told, 'if her child died in a car accident, she didn’t want to live either'. It meant the young mother was thrown from the car at some point before it burst into flames. She died from multiple injuries. Killer driver: Huxtable, 22, pictured in his police mugshot initially tried to claim he was not driving the car when it crashed . Mr Macfarlane said Huxtable had somehow managed to escape, flagging down a lorry driver and asking to hitch a ride towards his home. He said: 'There’s no evidence at all that he tried to give any help to Ms Kift. (The car) is burning furiously, his first thought should have been to the fire brigade - never mentioned.' Lee Bremridge, mitigating, said no custodial sentence would compare with his client having to live with causing the death of his friends. He said: 'This is a tragic case. What . Mr Huxtable did has led to the deaths of two friends of his on what were . dreadful circumstances. 'He . accepts full responsibility for what happened. Now aged 22, the events . of the early hours of June 1 will live with him for the rest of his . life.' Mr Bremridge said his . client wasn’t trying to 'flee the scene' following the crash, but . admitted that 'in hindsight' he should have told the lorry driver of the . seriousness of the incident. The . judge said: 'This is an early attempt to try and shift responsibility . for reasons which are frankly obvious. He’s a disqualified driver. 'To my mind the more serious aspect of it is trying to shift responsibility to Emma.' Speaking outside court, family and friends of the victims echoed Mr Justice Burnett's sentiments about drink-driving. Hazel . Kift, Ms Kift's mother, said: 'We are, and always will be, devastated . by the loss of Emma and Johnny. Our grief and heartbreaking loss is only . compounded by the fact this tragedy could have been avoided. 'We hope drivers like Jason Huxtable take a look at this. 'There . can be no justification for where mothers and fathers should have to . bury their children - where a 16-month-old little boy should have to . grow up without his mummy. 'We would like to thank the community for their support.' Following the sentence, a spokesman for the road safety charity Brake said drink driving is 'selfish. 'Death on the road is sudden, violent and utterly devastating for friends and families affected,' he said. 'Drink driving is selfish in the extreme, so it is vital there is an effective deterrent to stop them ruining others’ lives.' Crash scene: Flowers left at Loxhore Cross where the accident happened.

The film's poignantly honest portrayal of love in all manner of scenarios and comic situations (think Hugh Grant dancing through ‘Downing Street’ to Girls Aloud) prompted voters aged 20- 30 to vote it the film that showed them what real love is (21 per cent). The survey revealed that comedies . clearly do more than raise a laugh too as American Pie (for men) and Bridget .

It was the day that signalled the end of six years of bitter fighting, countless deaths, and heralded an Allied victory. So it's little wonder that impromptu parties and celebrations broke out across the US and Britain. August 14 1945, now known as Victory in Japan Day, saw the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War Two. Now, restored video footage shows sailors and soldiers taking to the streets of Honolulu, Hawaii, to cheer the Allied victory. Scroll down for video . Celebrations: US Navy personnel pack onto a car an punch the air with delight as they celebrate the end of World War Two . Relief: Delighted men and women wave at bystanders as they drive up and down the beachfront and honk their horns in delight . The end of the war: VJ Day was declared a two day holiday in the US, Britain and Australia as celebrations broke out to mark the Japanese surrender . Entertainment: A marching band takes to the streets to celebrate after days of rumours and speculation that the war was coming to an end . The poignant footage shows men in navy uniforms and their counterparts from the US Army packed on to cars and trucks punching the air and whooping with delight, honking their horns and waving at bystanders as they drive along the streets. Many of the military personnel are seen waving American flags and a ticker tape parade rains down on the streets and people drink and clink bottles in satisfied celebration. A marching band is also seen parading on the Honolulu streets while reunited couples look delighted to see each other again. The sunkissed scenes were a far cry from the scene in London, where thousands of Britons braved the rain to see King George VI parade down The Mall in an open top car or in Washington, where crowds gathered to hear President Truman's speech. Reunited: It's a wonder that the driver of this car can see as a couple sit on the roof while he drives in Honolulu . Fly past: The restored footage captures a group of fighter planes flying over Hawaii . Delighted: This couple are beaming as they grin for the camera following the announcement that the war was over . Happy: This delighted group are seen in the footage playing up for the camera . The moving footage ends with the tagline: 'None of us would be here today if not for you.' The celebrations and the Japanese surrender was particularly poignant in Hawaii, as Pearl Harbour on the island had been the scene of a catastrophic attack by 353 Japanese fighter planes in December 1941 - the trigger for the US to join World War Two. Some 2,402 Americans were killed in that attack. The Japanese government finally agreed to the terms of the Potsdam agreement which called for the unconditional surrender of the east Asian country just days after the US had dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima on August 6 and Nagasaki on August 9.

Japanese Emperor Hirohito had said: 'Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in the ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation but would lead also to the total extinction of human civilisation.' The Germans had of course surrendered in May. VJ Day was marked by a two day holiday in the US, the UK and Australia. Although VJ was celebrated in mid August, the Japanese didn't officially sign a surrender until September 2. Romantic view: This couple look ahead to the future now that the war has finally ended .

A new photography trend sees newlyweds plunge into the water and pose in their wedding outfits. Matt Adcock of Del Sol Photography, who is based in Mexico's Riviera Maya, has worked with hundreds of couples who choose to celebrate the first day of married life in this unique way. They ask to be photographed fully-submerged at exotic spots along the coast, and often by the end of the shoot they appear undressed as they let their soaked clothing slip off. Bizarre trend: Newlyweds are choosing to pose underwater in their wedding outfits to celebrate entering married life - here a couple hold a pose in the waters of Mexico's Riviera Maya . Mr Adock, who runs his business with his wife Sol Tamargo, told the Huffington Post that they occasionally run into danger on location and he always has a large team of people on hand to help. 'We mostly work in the safe places where you can stand, but we have a rescue swimmer at every shoot,' he explained. 'A lot of times we’re having to throw our cameras down and save the bride because her crinoline’s wrapped around her legs.' He said the craze for underwater wedding photography was born out of the Trash The Dress phenomenon, which sees brides effectively destroying a bridal gown by getting it wet or dirty. Time and patience: Photographer Matt Adcock said the images take hours of hard work as couples battle currents and cold water temperatures . Carefree: Many of the couples end up undressed by the end of the shoot as they let their clothing slip off . Most couples request to be photographed while navigating underground caves and rivers in Riviera Maya, which is a popular scuba diving and snorkeling destination. Although Mr Adock's images have an effortless feel, it takes hours of hard work to capture each one, as strong currents and cold water temperatures present a challenge. Describing some of the difficulties he faces, Mr Adock said: 'None of our brides or grooms are models, and that’s the most challenging issue. 'None of them know how to hold their bodies or move their arms or face. Hidden dangers: Some brides have to be rescued from shoots because they get tangled up in their dress . Letting go: The trend for underwater wedding photography was born out of the Trash The Dress phenomenon, which sees brides effectively destroying a bridal gown by getting it wet or dirty . Final touch up: A bride applies make-up in a mirror underwater . 'We’re constantly directing these people: ""OK, open your eyes” and “Don’t do that” and “OK, you’re covering your arm” and “Oops, wardrobe malfunction, pull up the dress."" '[That’s] coupled with water temperatures that are 62, 65 degrees - it’s cold. 'So it’s challenging to get what we want without, I don’t want to say killing them, but we are pushing them to their limits. 'And there is a current in these underground rivers, so these brides are fighting against the current.' Caught on camera: Mr Adcock says many of the couples are open about their sensuality . Carefree: One couple choose to end their photo shoot completely naked . Despite the tough conditions Mr Adcock says that most people seize the opportunity to express their sexuality. Some even request to conduct the whole photo session nude, while others get 'hot and steamy'. 'It’s a form of expression to be able to . show nudity and combine it with love and art. I’ve had clients order . huge wall prints, and we’ve had clients that are happy to share it on . Facebook,' he added. While working with clients he said it is important to build rapport and have fun. Often, he likes to dole out shots of tequila once a day's work is over. Del Sol Photography charges between $2,750 to . $4,000 per photo shoot. Mr Adcock said some brides are hesitant to use their original wedding dresses and choose to wear a second-hand gown instead.","Photographer Matt Adcock, who is based in Mexico's Riviera Maya, says often the team have to stop to save the bride from drowning in her dress .

Rubi Victoria Porter was born in Lincoln County Hospital on March 29 weighing 7lb 8oz. Her parents, Rudi and Vicky Porter, of Newark, Notts, said they had decided not to ask the sex of their baby during scans, so the birth of a girl was a complete surprise. Proud father Rudi holds baby Rubi, with (L to R) her grandfather, Chris Porter, great grandfather Thomas Porter and uncle Liam Porter . Vicky, 27, said the midwife had passed the baby straight to her so she was the first to see they had a daughter. 'I was over the moon when I looked and saw I'd had a little girl,' she said. Rudi, 29, said he had cried after the baby had arrived. He said: 'After all this time of the family having only boys it came as a real shock that we had finally got a girl.' The last girl before Rubi to be born into the family was the late Elizabeth Porter, who was born on January 2, 1922. Her brother, Tom Porter, 82, is Rubi's great grandfather.

Were it not for an apparently trivial series of events, Ross Noble, his wife Fran and baby daughter Elfie would have perished in the bushfire that destroyed their Australian home. It is four years since that traumatic day in February 2009 but this is the first time Noble, one of Britain’s most popular stand-up comedians, has felt able to talk about it at length. It has changed his outlook on life, and resulted in the family uprooting from their 100-acre farm just outside Melbourne and settling back in Britain, where he was born. ‘Normally, at that time of year, I would have been touring Australia and we would most likely have been in the house together just before the tour started,’ he says. ‘For various reasons, I’d decided to do a European tour instead and was preparing with some warm-up gigs in Australia. ‘On the day of the fire, Fran was due to come to meet me after a gig so we could spend some time on our own while her parents looked after Elfie at our house. ‘The day before, she took our two dogs to stay with some friends. When she got back, it was so hot in the house that, instead of waiting for her parents to come to us, she decided to drive over to them, about 45 minutes away, and return later when it was cooler. ‘Once there, her mum said: “Why don’t you just stay here tonight? Ross is away, and the dogs aren’t in the house. I’ll cook the tea, the baby is asleep, and we can head back to the house with Elfie tomorrow.” ‘She agreed to stay, but first she wanted to go home to pick up some things. However, when she turned into our road a fire truck ordered her to turn around. She drove back down the road as fast as she could, with flames chasing her. ‘If she’d got there ten minutes earlier she would have been in the house when the flames came through. Or if she hadn’t decided to go to her parents, she would have still been in the house.’ As he says this, the sense of narrowly avoided loss is still palpable. Noble, now 36, had converted his cellar into a vault housing a 2,500 DVD and vintage vinyl record collection, rare comedy memorabilia and collectable toys. He lost it all, as well as his beloved classic motorbikes. All he had left was an overnight bag and a change of clothing for his tour. After a few weeks sorting things out in Australia, and feeling the urge to cling together, Fran and Elfie accompanied him on his UK tour. Fran is Australian, but Ross comes from Northumberland. ‘We’d be in a different hotel every night, with a four-month-old baby and our three bags — which was all we possessed. ‘But at least we had somewhere. Some people had lost everything and were living in tents. Ross leaves Oz: Ross Noble and his family left their 100-acre farm in Australia after it got destroyed in a bushfire and moved Britain . ‘Me and Fran were messed up by it all. I talk in my sleep and sleep walk with my eyes wide open at the best of times. Fran was suffering from post-traumatic stress and having horrendous nightmares. Elfie was waking up — because that’s what babies do. ‘I had these nightmares where I’d wake up and think they were dead, and I’d have to check the bed and cot to make sure they weren’t. Then I’d be able to go back to sleep. ‘I had to do a gig in Glasgow and the thought of dragging them up there from London was just too much, so I went on my own. I woke up in Glasgow to find I had trashed the hotel room. I had obviously freaked out, gone round the place going mad looking for Fran and Elfie, and then gone back to sleep. ‘Doing the comedy shows helped, because a show is all about being in that moment. It stopped me dwelling on what had happened.’ They set about trying to rebuild their lives, and six months later were sitting in an empty house outside Melbourne awaiting delivery of their new furniture. ‘It might seem like a weird thing to say, but we felt very lucky,’ says Noble. ‘Yes we lost our house, we lost our lifestyle, all our stuff, but none of us died or was burned. ‘Considering what happened to a lot of people, we got off lightly. We lost 15 friends and neighbours in our street that day.’ In the remote area where Noble lived — which he calls ‘Paradise on Earth’ — the locals were well-drilled in fire precautions. ‘There were a lot of people we knew who died who were as prepared as you could possibly be. But if a fire of that size comes through, you don’t stand a chance. There is nothing you can do to survive.’ When things settled, they considered moving north to Queensland, but when there was torrential flooding there, Fran said she wanted  to move to  the English countryside. ‘I loved the Australian bush but it’s a harsh place to live, especially with a young family [their second baby is due any moment]. When children are playing outside, you have constantly to be on the lookout for poisonous snakes and spiders. We wanted to live that life, but we didn’t want such risks.’ The loss of all his possessions made him more philosophical, too. ‘It’s not that you appreciate what you’ve got more, but you realise it could end in an instant. It makes you enjoy the moment a lot more. The main thing I learned when you lose everything is that you are the curator of a collection that no one cares about. You think it’s an important collection, but if you died it would end up in a charity shop. Scream with laughter: Ross Noble as Stitches the clown in horror comedy with the same name . ‘I’ve got very few things now, and everything I do own feels like there’s no history to it. I try to buy old things with some kind of story. ‘Just after the fire, I was left with just the one pair of sandals. The Red Cross set up a stall to help people out locally. Hundreds of new boots were donated, and someone had put their old fire-fighting boots amongst them. ‘They were knackered, but I thought “I’ll have them.” They had a big hole in them, but they’re probably my favourite shoes because they have a history.’ This eccentric side of Noble has been an integral part of his success as a comedian. He was no less eccentric as an 11-year-old child, riding the ten miles from Cramlington to his school in Newcastle on a unicycle and carrying his books in a pizza box. ‘I used to shave my head, leaving a long fringe which I dyed blond. ‘One of my school reports — I wish I still had it — said: “His eccentric classroom behaviour will be a real handicap for him in the future.” Really?’ He laughs at the memory. Of course, it’s been the making of him and his fortune. ‘As soon as I said I want to be a comedian, my mum and dad said, “Well, that’s a natural progression.” Most parents would probably say, “Oh, he’s going to be destitute”, but they just went: “Brilliant!”. ‘There are people who say “Oh, you need something to fall back on”. I just think that’s the very thing you don’t need, because you will fall back on it. I started stand-up when I was 15, then at 18 I moved to London. Cracking the London circuit was almost like starting again.’ But crack it he did, and by 1999 he was nominated for a Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival, he has now become a TV comedy fixture, and toured the UK every year — only taking a year off last year to settle into the family’s new home near Rochester, Kent. He’s back in Australia for a tour in March, and at the same time the comedy horror movie he made last year, Stitches, is released on DVD in the UK. The film won the Best Death award at 2012’s Frightfest. His stage shows are famously unscripted. Surely it’s terrifying to stand on stage and not know exactly what you are going to say? ‘You know what is scary to me? Getting up in the morning and working in a factory. Or if someone said to me: “Oh, you are in charge of running a children’s home.” That would really terrify me.’ Ross Noble’s DVD Nonsensory Overload is out now. Stitches is out on DVD and Blu-Ray on March 4.","Family lost everything in 2009 bushfire which destroyed their Australian farm .

'It was simply an amazing sight and it was definitely something that I have never seen before. 'I like the light, the shapes of the ice, and the massive amount of walruses on them.

The mascot of a major league baseball team is in hot water after photographed holding up a sign described by officials as inappropriate and offensive. The Tampa Bay Rays mascot, Raymond, was seen holding the fan-made sign that mocks the death of Steve Irwin during Wednesday night's game in Florida, leading to an official apology by the team. The sign shows the Crocodile Hunter's name struck through as part of the Rays ‘to do list,’ along with a gasping photo of the late wildlife expert who was killed by a stingray barb in 2006. Below that, left uncrossed, is the next task to complete: The World Series. Laughs: Tampa Bay Rays mascot Raymond holds up a sign made by a fan that mocks the death of Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter, who was killed by a stingray barb in 2006 . 'I love Steve Irwin but come on, it's funny,' Lloyd Johnson, a 29-year-old Army veteran who designed the sign told the New York Daily News. During the Rays' game Johnson said he handed the mascot the sign who after reviewing it, stood on some chairs to show it off to the rest of those around them. '...obviously [he] thought it was funny because he stood up on the chairs and held it up for literally 3 seconds, obviously realizing what he was doing or when he saw the reaction from some of the fans, and got down and tried to hand it back,' Johnson told DeadSpin in an email after. Johnson says reaction around him to the sign was generally positive, and still is. Apology: The tragic death of conservationist and animal expert Steve Irwin, pictured, shocked and stunned the world, prompting the MLB team to release an apology for the sign they called offensive and inappropriate . 'Every time I stood up I was stopped to take a picture with someone. I probably took 20-30 photos with people,' he said of that game. 'The reaction, at least from what I heard at the stadium and on Facebook, was positive.' The team had other thoughts, releasing a statement that apologized for what they called an 'inappropriate' mistake. 'Last night Rays mascot Raymond was handed an inappropriate sign brought to the game by a fan,' it read. 'Fans are welcome to bring signs into Tropicana Field provided they are not offensive. The Tampa Bay Rays regret that this particular sign was displayed in the ballpark, and we apologize for the lapse in judgment.' Johnson said a ticket agent reviewed his sign before he entered the stadium, but doesn't think the man understood it before handing it back. But Johnson, who's studying sports management and marketing, reveals this wasn't his first homemade sign taken to game. He previously created a sign for a Denver Broncos game that substituted Irwin's name with Christopher Reeve's. Reeve became a quadriplegic after being thrown from a horse in 1995.","The sign was handed to the mascot by a fan to hold up before the crowd in Florida .

A Virginia woman claiming to have purchased Renoir painting for $7 at a flea market has been unmasked and is now under FBI investigation after it emerged the painting was stolen in 1951. Marcia 'Martha' Fuqua from Loudon County, Virginia, had tried to remain anonymous and said she purchased the painting simply for its frame and had no special ‘understanding of art.’ But it has now emerged that the painting 'On the Shore of The Seine' was reported stolen from the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1951, according to the Washington Post. The FBI seized the painting late last year after learning that information and it has since emerged that Fuqua's mother was a painter who specialised in reproducing the work of several artists including Renoir. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Owner? Marcia 'Martha' Fuqua, seen left in 2010 while learning how to become a blackjack dealer in Washington, says she bought a painting by Renoir at a flea market in late 2009 for $7 . 'The painting was last seen hanging at the museum in 1951,' the Baltimore Museum of Art's Director Doreen Bolger tells WJZ of the historical item the museum is working with the FBI to get back. It was gifted to the museum after its purchase from a Baltimore art collector in the 1920s. A few decades later, it vanished she said, only to appear in the hands of Fuqua at auction last year. After the auction house was contacted by a Washington Post reporter who revealed the piece's theft, the FBI stepped in, immediately removing the painting from Fuqua’s possession. In a letter to the agency in December, Fuqua - who runs a driving school and is a retired physical education teacher  - declared her innocence while demanding its return to her. 'I have a layperson’s understanding of art,' she said in her letter obtained by the Post. Stolen: In 1951 the Baltimore Museum of Art reported this painting, On the Shore of the Seine, stolen with the FBI seizing it just days before it was to be sold at auction late last year . 'I am not an art dealer or broker, art historian or art collector, and have no special education, training or experience which would give me expertise in the field of fine art or in particular, in the identification of authentic French Impressionistic works,' she wrote. But her null experience in art doesn't appear to be entirely true, according to the Post. Until now Ms Fuqua's name was hidden . from the public - she referred to herself only as 'Renoir Girl' in a . September interview. Fuqua's . mother graduated Goucher College with a degree in fine art, before in . 1957 receiving a master’s degree from the Maryland Institute College of . Art. She then opened up an art school which her daughter for a time helped her run, the Post reports. Fuqua's professional background consists of having taught middle school physical education and working as a casino blackjack dealer, according to the Post. Adding an unexpected twist, a . man who identified himself as Fuqua's brother, Matt Fuqua, later told . the Post that the painting's origin may not have been all his sister said. '[My mother has] had it for a long time, probably 50 or 60 years,' he said of the painting. Fight: The museum, pictured, hopes the painting will be returned but Fuqua insists that it is hers and purchased without knowing its true value or having any special art knowledge . 'My . girlfriend and her friends were cleaning out my mom’s studio, and my . sister stepped in and said, ""Wow, I want this."" All I know is my sister . didn’t just go buy it at a flea market. . . . My sister kind of snagged . it out of my mom’s art studio.' He added that his mother and sister 'are keeping me out of the loop. It was supposed to be mine.' The man later retracted what he told the Post, saying he doesn't 'know the facts.' After a third phone call he told the Post that someone posing as him had answered the phone. He said that person has since been arrested. In Fuqua's September interview she told the Post, 'It’s all very coincidental ... I am one of those people that believes that things happen for a reason.' 'I noticed the frame on this picture and I liked the frame. I bid $7 and I won the box,' she said. Though the frame boldly shows a center plaque reading RENOIR on it, she said she never thought that it would be authentic, it having been found in a box at a flea market after all. She said she stored it in a plastic trash bag for two years, even in a shed at one point, before having it authenticated as a genuine Renoir. Bolger hopes that however the FBI’s investigation ends, it will with the painting’s return to the museum. 'A number of people have submitted or individuals or organizations have submitted pleadings regarding it and the court will make a decision,' she said.

Shots are heard echoing through the halls of a former elementary school, yet teens inside are seen scurrying for cover. Others scream for help. 'For every second that goes by, I told you this, you are going to have dead children,' actor Steven Seagal addressed volunteers participating in a simulated school shooting in Fountain Hills, Arizona last February. The action start joined forces with 'America's Toughest Sheriff,' Joe Arpaio, for a training exercise on how to respond to a school shooting. It’s now being featured in a special for ABC’s Nightline. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Instructor: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, left, watches as actor and Maricopa County posse member Steven Seagal addresses the media about a simulated school shooting in Fountain Hills, Arizona in February . 'I am here to try to teach the posse firearms and martial arts to try to help them learn how to respond quicker and help protect our children,' Seagal said. It was one of many exercises as unique as Seagal's appearance himself that was undertaken by a small batch of the more than 3,000 - and said to be growing - members of the sheriff's school posse patrol. Arpaio enlisted Seagal to train his Maricopa County posse members with about 25 children between the ages of 14 and 18 used as stand-ins for scared students. Seen hiding under overturned tables or scrambling away from an entering gunman, the children did as they were told and screamed for help. To add realism to the training event, guns firing non-lethal rounds that leave a color mark were used. Practice makes perfect: A young teen cowers under an overturned table during the simulation held in a former elementary school . Life-like: To add realism to the training event, guns firing non-lethal rounds that leave a color mark were used . Purpose: The training, overseen by Seagal, was to help better prepare the sheriff's posse who are a collection of volunteers from the community hoping to take a stand against crime . 'In January, 2013, shortly after the Connecticut school shooting which left 26 people dead and the discovery here in Phoenix by Sheriff’s deputies of a high school student’s plans to kill fellow classmates in a local high school, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio launched a new program using his all-volunteer posse to patrol areas surrounding schools within his jurisdiction,' a press release for his program reads. Seagal, a burly martial arts expert turned actor, guided 48 volunteers through various aspects of responding to a shooting, including room-to-room searches, and critiqued their work. For some, video covering the graphic scene, however safe, did little to comfort. 'Images of simulated student shootings in school hallways splashed across the media are terrifying and do nothing to further the serious discussions needed by responsible adults dedicated to humbly serving our communities,' Ginny Dickey, a Fountain Hills Councilwoman said in a statement in response. Protests: Some called Seagal's credentials 'ludicrous', two of his movie posters seen here, while others simply attacked the overly graphic exercise that involved children . Friends: Sheriff Joe Arpaio is seen introduced by Seagal during a campaign rally in Mesa, Arizona in 2012 . Arizona Democratic House Minority Leader Chad Campbell called the plan to use Seagal as an instructor 'ludicrous.' 'Steve Seagal is an actor. That's it. Why don't we also have Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris and Bruce Willis come out and train them too while we're at it,' Campbell said. 'I've put hundreds of thousands, if not millions of hours into my weapons training,' Segal addressed his credentials before the volunteers and media in February, a quote not missed by comedian Stephen Colbert. 'Now a million hours is technically 115 years, which sounds crazy, but then again so does asking Steven Seagal to train your posse,' he said on his program after. About a dozen people protested the event outside. 'No gun should ever be in a school,' said protester Cynthia Wharton, a Fountain Hills resident. Arpaio's 3,450-strong posse of unpaid men and women has for years helped the sheriff target drunken drivers and illegal immigrants, and chase down fathers who are behind on child support. Guides: Seagal, a burly martial arts expert turned actor, guided 48 of Arpaio's volunteers through various aspects of responding to a shooting, including room-to-room searches, and critiqued their work . 'It's important to help protect our children and our schools and we need to do that with whatever means we have,' said Rick Velotta, a posse member and retired General Electric manager who attended the training. Last year, Arpaio sent posse members to Hawaii to investigate the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate at the request of local Tea Party activists, a key Arpaio constituency. A sometime resident of the Phoenix Valley and member of Arpaio's posse, Seagal, 60, starred in big-budget films in the 1980s and early 1990s, earning a reputation as an action star in movies like 'Above the Law' and 'Under Siege.' He more recently played a corrupt Mexican drug lord in the 2010 film 'Machete.' Seagal also has been sworn in as a sheriff's deputy in a Texas county along the border with Mexico and appeared in a reality TV show detailing his work as a reserve deputy in New Orleans. On Wednesday Seagal appeared alongside President Vladimir Putin, overseeing a physical fitness program for Russia’s youth.

A fight is now underway at the Oaks Club in Osprey, Florida between those trying to protect the thousands of birds nested between the two islands and those feared to be deliberately trying to set them on fire. Beverly Meadows says she recently saw four fireworks fired into the islands, sending sparks and flames potentially landing in piles of dried branches and trees left by workers. War: Residents of this private, country club community are accused of shooting fireworks into these two center islands that are home to thousands of birds, those homes seen circled being outspoken residents against them . Outraged: Beverly Meadows, whose house is on the lake, says she recently saw four fireworks fired into the islands to scare the birds causing her to fear her neighbors are trying to deliberately set them on fire . 'Hundreds of birds raised up from the island they screamed from the top of their voice and they few away in terror,' Mrs Meadows told My Sun Coast of the recent scene. 'We want to scare a few birds away, and did it work? No!' Page Halpin told My Sun Coast. 'Do you know what it’s like near about 3,000 egrets and herons?

With her is Bill Troutman, a concerned grandfather who uses a regulator tank to help him breathe while awaiting a double-lung transplant. He says that while the birds' waste is especially messy, their feathers and dander spread disease and keep him from being able to safely go outside. 'They are flying, and that becomes airborne, and these diseases, they can affect anything, but the most common is the lungs because we breathe in that air,' he told the Observer Group. The islands sit on a 7.3-acre lake at The Oaks Club, home to two Championship golf courses, the Eagle and the Heron.

Anger: Oaks Club resident Page Halpin says the birds have caused thousands of dollars in damage to her backyard, including hundreds to have her pool cage pressure washed and $4,000 for a new deck . Too many: Some residents say there are far too many of the birds and only want to cut down their numbers, several seen on the edge of a lake . Scared: Since the residents starting shooting fireworks at the island, Mrs meadows says the birds have started to leave the area . ‘Respectful of our pristine environment, our courses share habitat with eagles, egrets, sandhill cranes, turtles, blue herons, bobcats and other native species,’ The Oak Club’s website reads. ‘These close encounters with nature’s vibrant flora and fauna greatly enhance—and inspire—the golfing experience.’ A request for comment by The Oak Club by the MailOnline was not returned. In January the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission issued the Board of Governors of The Oaks Club a migratory bird-nest removal permit, allowing their habitat's thinning with the aided removal of an invasive tree. When a protected bird species began nesting on the island soon after, it halted their work but left the piles of dead branches and trees on the island which Mrs Meadows fears could catch fire. Since the residents starting shooting fireworks at the island she says the birds have started to leave.","Residents say the birds spread disease and filth on their property and need to be thinned .

The animal, thought to be a young male, was spotted on the shoreline of North Ronaldsay in Scotland. Eyewitnesses said it appeared to be in good health and happy to be the centre of attention. This walrus was seen basking on the shore at Bridesness on the south east coast of North Ronaldsay today. A walrus was spotted on one of the Orkney islands in Scotland, more than 2,200 miles away from home . He was spotted around 10am by a . birdwatcher. Experts think he is a boy due to the pinkish nodules . on his neck and shoulders. It . was first seen by Mark Warren, the assistant warden of the North . Ronaldsay Bird Observatory and Guest House - who is more used to logging . birds. The 32-year-old could not believe his eyes. 'My husband rang me and said `guess what I`ve just seen? A walrus!`,"" said his wife Fleur, 28. 'I thought he was joking at first. 'It is just amazing that he has turned up here. He seems happy enough and gives out a grunt. We would not like to get too close. Even though he`s young he is still a big animal. The animal, thought to be a young male, takes a well-deserved rest after his mammoth trip . 'He does not appear to have sustained any injury and could just be not used to encountering humans. But it is simply unbelievable.' Walrus populations are concentrated around the North Pole and Arctic Ocean areas - Siberia, Canada, Greenland and Alaska - living in shallow waters above the continental shelves. The large flippered marine mammals, characterised by their long tusks, spend significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice. Their population dropped rapidly as they were widely killed by humans for their blubber, walrus ivory and meat during the 19th and 20th centuries. Walrus populations are concentrated around the North Pole and Arctic Ocean areas, where it is thought this uninjured walrus came from . However, their population rebounded after hunting them became largely outlawed. Walruses are famous for their tusks and are the only pinnipeds - true seals, sea lions and fur seals - that have them. The tusks can grow up to 1m in length, and males tend to have larger tusks than females. The tusks are used for keeping breathing holes in the ice open, for fighting and for helping the walruses haul themselves out of the water on to an ice floe. Adult males in the Pacific can weigh more than 1,700 kg (3,700 lb) and, among pinnipeds, are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals. Walruses live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves, spending significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat. Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered to be a ""keystone species"" in the Arctic marine regions.","The walrus was spotted on the shore of one of the Orkney islands today .

End zone: The cart took off when a field marker became stuck on the accelerator and crashed into a crowd at the stadium in Texas . The incident happened after Spring Dekaney beat Cibolo Steele at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, in December 2011. According to a law suit filed at Dallas County Court on Tuesday, Amendola states he was 'struck, without warning, by a motorized cart, which employees ... failed to exercise proper control over'. Spring Dekaney, from Harris County, Texas, beat Cibolo Steele 34-14 during the Class 5A Divison II state championships and the coach was speaking to reporters at the 50-yard line when the cart careered into the crowd. TV cameras showed a stunned Amendola falling backwards into the passenger seat of the golf cart as he tried to gain control of the vehicle.

Enabled: Confessed serial killer Israel Keyes was given a razor blade in his Alaska jail cell allowing him to commit suicide in December it's been revealed . A serial killer who killed himself with a razor blade in his prison cell told police he would give up the location of two bodies in return for a cigar. In 15 hours of newly released audio recordings, Israel Keyes offered detectives information about his killings, including the names of his victims, the murder weapon and where he dumped the bodies. Teasing police about what he knew, he refused to give up the details unless they agreed to execute him within a year so his young daughter would not have to grow up with her father in prison. Without that promise he kept silent - except for an occasional cigar. In one of the recordings he tells police: 'I'll give you two bodies and a name... I can give you one of the murder weapons and the rest of the story, like everything that happened, but I'm not going to give you the rest [today].""He stopped and then added, 'If I get a cigar.' After the smoke break, Keyes gave them the name, Currier. It was the last name of a Vermont couple, Bill and Lorraine Currier, who had disappeared in June 2011. He then used a map to show where their house in Vermont was and the place where their bodies could be found. The interviews with Keyes, which were carried out between April and July 2012, ended when he committed suicide in his prison cell in December last year. After Keyes' death the Alaska Department of Corrections admitted a razor blade was mistakenly issued to confessed serial killer Israel Keyes in his jail cell allowing him to slash his wrists and commit suicide. Keyes was found dead in his cell on Dec 2, months before he was to have gone on trial for the 2012 slaying of 18-year-old Anchorage barista Samantha Koenig. The razor was never found. Outraged by this latest report, Ms Koenig’s family are calling the security lapse no mistake after only three months earlier Keyes, believed responsible for at least eight murders across the U.S., was found possessing an object modified into a handcuff key. That discovery heightened Keyes’ security, segregating him from other inmates and subjecting him to daily . strip searches and cell searches. ‘I . don’t think it was mistaken at all,’ Ms Koenig’s father James Koenig . angrily reacted to Keyes’ supplied razor. ‘How do you mistakenly give . someone in segregation a real razor blade?’ He . accuses the Corrections Department of robbing his family of their day . in court, on Wednesday saying he doesn’t believe the official version . released by the agency. Keyes . slit his left wrist with a razor blade and tied a noose around his neck . and right foot, according to the Correction’s report, which says the . exact cause of death is unknown although it has been classified as a . suicide. Justice: Family of 18-year-old Samantha Koenig who was abducted from a coffee shop, raped and murdered by Keyes, he has admitted, say he wrongly escaped justice through his own suicide . Abduction: Video surveillance seen here captures the moment Keyes approached Koenig in the coffee shop and forced her outside and into his parked Silverado . The state had previously denied an open records request from The Associated Press for details of events surrounding Keyes’ death. Corrections spokeswoman Kaci Schroeder told the AP that officials later decided to take another look at the case and see what could be released publicly. Schroeder said officials are not discussing what disciplinary actions, if any, were taken, over the lapse. However, she said because of this, any restriction for inmates are being posted on the cell doors in addition to being noted in a prisoner log. Before he died, Keyes told investigators he had killed Koenig and at least seven other people across the country, including Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vt. Investigators believe there could be more victims. Keyes was set for a March trial in federal court in the abduction and killing of Koenig. Authorities aren't certain when Keyes' crime spree began or ended. But they have a haunting image of his last known victim. Snippets of a surveillance video show the first terrifying moments of Koenig's abduction. Keyes is seen as a shadowy figure in ski mask and hood outside Common Grounds, a tiny Anchorage coffee shack then partially concealed from a busy six-lane highway by mountains of snow. More victims: Keyes is believed responsible for at least eight murders across the country, including Bill and Lorraine Currier of Vermont, Bill's mother and his wife Lorraine seen here . It's February 1, 2012, about 8pm, closing time. Koenig is shown handing Keyes a cup of coffee, then backing away with her hands up, as if it's a robbery. The lights go out and Keyes next appears as a fuzzy image climbing through the drive-thru window.Authorities outlined his next steps: . Monster: After Keyes killed Koenig he sent her family a picture of her body that made them believe she was still alive if they sent him ransom money . Keyes forced Koenig to his Silverado; he'd already bound her hands with zip ties and gagged her. He hid her in a shed outside his house, turned on loud music so no one could hear if she screamed, then returned to the coffee shack to retrieve scraps of the restraints and get her phone. On February 2, Keyes raped and strangled Koenig. He left her in that shed, flew to Houston and embarked on a cruise, returning about two weeks later. He then took a photo of Koenig's body holding a February13 newspaper to make it appear she was alive. Keyes wrote a ransom note on the back, demanding $30,000 be placed in her account. He texted a message, directing the family to a dog park where the note could be found. Her family deposited some money from a reward fund. The abduction gripped Anchorage as investigators held out hope that she remained alive. Keyes was arrested in March in Lufkin, Texas. He had sought a ransom and used Koenig’s debit card throughout his travel across country. Three weeks after the arrest, Koenig’s dismembered body was found in a frozen lake north of Anchorage. Koenig and the Curriers were the only victims named by Keyes. Admittance: The murder of Bill and Lorraine Currier were the only other murders Keyes specifically admitted to outside of Koenig's . Keyes was in state custody in Anchorage because there are no federal prisons in Alaska. But as those who knew Keyes revealed, his secret double-life was never once hinted at or revealed by him. ‘I never got any bad, weird, scary, odd vibe from him in any way, shape or form,’ says Paul Adelman, an Anchorage attorney who first hired Keyes as a handyman in 2008. Keyes' live-in girlfriend also was floored to learn of his double life, according to David Kanters, her friend. ‘He had everyone fooled,’ Kanters told The Associated Press in an email. ‘THAT is the scary part. He came across as a nice normal guy.’ (She did not respond to numerous requests for comment.) Shock: Family and friends of Keyes say there was nothing to lead them to believe he had such a secretive second life as a self-admitted serial killer . The corrections report says Keyes was last seen alive at 10:13 p.m. on Dec. 1. A number of security checks were conducted periodically throughout the night and early morning. Security officers are required to look into each cell and verify the prisoner is present and their status, the report says. ‘Procedures . call for security staff to visually observe the prisoner’s uncovered . skin. Keyes’ death was not observed during those security checks,’ the . report says. At 5:57 . a.m., Dec. 2, an official found what appeared to be blood along Keyes’ bunk and floor. The report says this was only noticed after lights came . on; before that, an LED nightlight in the overhead fixture was the only . light source. Medical personnel were called, and Keyes was declared dead at 6:13 a.m. Digging for clues: In this April 12, 2012 photo, state police investigators sift through dirt and debris at a dig site off Vermont 15 near Lang Farm in Essex, Vermont . State police investigators paused to allow a dog to inspect dirt and debris at the dig site off Vermont 15 near Lang Farm in Essex, Vermont . Keyes attempted to escape from the federal courthouse on May 23, 2012. After that, enhanced security measures were used on Keyes, including full restraints, a two-officer escort any time he was out of the cell, and restrictions on possession of razors and pencils. He also was subjected to daily strip searches and cell searches. On Sept. 11, the report says, Keyes was found guilty of possessing an object which had been modified as a handcuff key. A disciplinary board found him guilty, and he had to serve 60 days — with 45 days suspended — in punitive segregation. That sentence began Nov. 28, and his access to personal property was restricted.","Israel Keyes is believed to have killed at least eight people across the U.S. before taking his own life in December .

A schoolboy's life was saved when he was rushed to hospital after being hit by car only for doctors to find he had a deadly brain tumour. Remarkable Liam Taylor-Kennedy was knocked down whilst walking home from school in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. The eight-year-old escaped with only minor bruising but concerned doctors noticed he was suffering from memory lapses and called for a CAT scan on his head. It showed an apple-sized dark patch on the right side of Liam's brain and an MRI scan at Sheffield Children's Hospital revealed it was an aggressive tumour called an anaplastic ependymoma. Liam Taylor-Kennedy, eight, was hit by a car on the way to school. When he was taken to hospital doctors discovered he had a very aggressive brain tumour . Liam with his mum Sharmaine before his operation to remove his brain tumour last month. The schoolboy is on the road to recovery from a brain tumour thanks to being knocked down by a car . Patients suffering from the tumour would usually suffer headaches, loss of vision and vomiting, but Liam had shown none of the symptoms. A week later surgeons removed the cancer but to remove some cells that remain the NHS is paying for specialist proton beam treatment in Jacksonville, Florida, not available in the UK. Mum Sharmaine Kennedy, 24, said it was a 'miracle' her son was knocked over on January 10 as doctors said in just weeks the tumour could have caused a stroke. Doctors diagnosed Liam with an aggressive tumour called an anaplastic ependymoma, which they have now removed . She said: 'Doctors told us if it had gone unnoticed for another couple of weeks he could have lost the use of the left hand side of his body or had a stroke . 'Liam actually said he wanted to send a card thanking the person who knocked him over but we haven't got round to finding out who it was yet.' Liam returned to his classes at Kings Oak Primary this week for the first time since being knocked over and Sharmaine said it was as though he had never been ill. A week after his MRI scan, Liam underwent a seven hour operation to remove the tumour. Although the operation was a success, the aggressiveness of the tumour meant that, even if a few cells remained, it would soon grow back. Radiotherapy is available in Sheffield but is not ideal for treatment on the brain and, because of Liam's age, could cause damage. Proton beam treatment is seen as a safer alternative but is not available in this country so the NHS is paying for him to receive treatment in Jacksonville, Florida. The treatment, accommodation and flights for Sharmane and Liam are being paid for but they will still have to pay for food and other living costs for the eight weeks he will receive treatment. Liam pictured on holiday last summer with his mother Sharmaone, and sisters Ocean, five, and Mazi-Lea, two . An ependymoma is a tumour that forms when cells in the brain and spinal cord begin to rapidly multiply. An anaplastic ependymoma is a more unusual tumour which grows at a much quicker rate.Ependymomas can happen at any age. When they occur in children they are usually found in the brain. In adults they are more commonly found in the spinal cord.Treatment begins with surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible, then radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or radiosurgery.An ependymoma in the brain of a child can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and an increasing head size due to fluid trapped in the skull.Adults may experience a blind spot, some weakness or paralysis and changes in thinking and personality. People with a spinal ependymoma can experience pain, difficulty in moving and even paralysis. Liam's dad, Scott Taylor and little sisters, Ocean and Mazi-Lee will stay at home. Fundraising efforts have start and there will be an event at the Old Town Hall on March 7. Sharmaine said: 'We've had lots of donations from shops on Wombwell and the community support we've had has been brilliant. 'Lots of people have donated little bits for raffle prizes - it's been great. 'He's been such a fighter throughout and was up and about within days of the surgery . 'It's . a heartbreaking thing for any mother to go through and this has been an . incredibly hard couple of months but, when he's running about, you tend to forget. 'It's when you're on your own that it really hits you.' Liam and Sharmaine are expected to . fly out to America in the next four weeks but she said, after the eight . weeks of treatment, she wanted to continue to raise money in the fight . against brain cancer. Sharmaine said: 'I'm going to do some . more fundraising when I get back, too, because I don't want anyone else . to have to go through this. 'It . costs £500,000 for one of these proton beam machines and, although . we're never going to raise that much, we can do what we can.'

A 91-year-old pensioner has been hailed a hero after rescuing her elderly neighbour from his smoke-filled flat. Jessamine Skuse spotted smoke billowing from her neighbour's home and without a thought for her own safety, ran inside and pulled Evan Davis, 97, to safety. Despite her frail frame, Jessamine managed to drag Evan, who had only recently been discharged from hospital, out of his house and onto a mobility scooter before fire officers arrived. Firefighters claim her super strength and quick thinking probably saved Evan's life. Jessamine Skuse, 91, helped save the life of her 97-year-old neighbour Evan Davis, after smoke filled his flat . The flats in Knowle, Bristol where Jessamine pulled from Evan his smoke-filled home and on to a mobility scooter before firefighters arrived . Her swift actions meant the fire brigade could get to the flats in Knowle, Bristol - home to many elderly people - and extinguish a smouldering tea towel before it burst into flames. And the modest pensioner counts her blessings that waking up early allowed her to spot, and smell, the danger. She said: 'I wake up at 6am every day because I worked for 40 years and it's programmed into my body clock. 'That was very fortunate because at about 6.30am, I could smell smoke. 'I went out into the corridor and I could smell it out there too, but I didn't know where it was coming from. 'I came back to my flat to see if I'd left anything on, but I hadn't. Firefighters claim Jessamine's super strength and quick-thinking probably saved Evan's life . Jessamine Skuse, aged 20, whilst serving in the 80th Army Searchlight Regiment (Auxiliary Territorial Service) during WWII in 1942 . 'I went back out and could see the smoke coming from under Evan's door. I banged and banged and shouted to him and he said 'just a minute'. 'When he opened the door he was on the floor and the flat was absolutely full of smoke. 'It was such a shock - it was bellowing out.' Evan then went back into his home and sat down in his front room, not realising how dangerous it was. 'I went over and grabbed him by the arm and said 'come on, Evan',' Jessamine explained. 'I put my arm around him and helped him out of the door and he said 'where are we going?' so I said 'it's all right, come with me'. 'I got him out into the corridor and went and got a shop mobility aid for him to sit on, but by the time I did that he was on the floor again. 'I managed to pull him up and sit him down, but he was very heavy, then I got him a glass of water and waited for the fire brigade to arrive. 'It was a good job I was up early because otherwise Evan could have died in all that smoke. 'And if his flat had caught fire it could have spread to all of our flats. A copy of the letter sent to Jessamine when she was awarded the Imperial Service Medal for 40 years civil service . Still active and healthy, every Sunday Jessamine rings one of the bells at St Martin's Church . 'These are private flats with People For Places. We don't have a warden here all the time, so if I'd been up any later there would have been no way of me getting in if he couldn't answer the door. 'I had a bit of coughing from the smoke, but I'm alright now.' Evan was taken to hospital suffering with smoke inhalation and has not yet returned home. Avon Fire and Rescue crews from Brislington and Temple stations used a CO2 extinguisher on what was believed to have been a tea towel Mr Davis had left on a lamp to dry. Miss Skuse, who lives alone, worked for the civil service in The Pithay for 40 years and was proud to receive the Imperial Service Medal (ISM). From 1942 to 1947, she served her country with the 80th Search Light Regiment - a time that taught her to be calm in an emergency. She added: 'Being in the Army definitely taught me a lot. 'I don't think I would still be here today if I hadn't gone into the Army. It teaches you to keep calm in emergencies, keeps you fit and teaches you discipline. 'We used to get up early and do 12-mile route marches.' Miss Skuse doesn't have any children, but dotes over her many nieces and nephews. Still active and healthy, every Sunday she rings one of the bells at St Martin's Church and during the Olympics last summer managed to ring the bell for three-minutes non-stop to mark the event. Relieved she was able to help Mr Davis, her neighbour of 11 years, she added: 'You've got to be alert even though you get older. 'You've still got to care for one another, because a lot of people don't.' Avon Fire and Rescue spokesman James Bladon said: 'There is little doubt the actions of Miss Skuse played a significant part in averting a much more serious incident. 'Just a couple of breaths of smoke in a house fire is enough to kill, so the sooner you can get to a place of fresh air, the better. 'Although we would never advise anyone to enter a property that's on fire, we thank Miss Skuse for the part she played that morning. 'Not everyone is fortunate enough to have such a quick-thinking neighbour, which is why installing smoke alarms on every level of your home and testing them on a regular basis is so important. 'Smoke alarms provide vital early warning of a fire, allowing you and your loved ones time to escape safely.'","Jessamine Skuse, 91, dragged her neighbour out of his flat to safety .

Grand National-winning rider Ryan Mania will today undergo a precautionary MRI scan following his heavy fall at Hexham but then hopes to be able to leave hospital. The irony, of course, is that if he had not won Saturday's big race, these words would never have seen the light of day. On Saturday morning, Ryan was just another ambitious jump jockey recognised by only the keenest of racing fans. The Ryan Mania of 24 hours earlier being airlifted to hospital would hardly have warranted a paragraph in a national newspaper. But after his win on Auroras Encore at Aintree, I watched him walk into the Hexham track flanked by security guards. The fall: Ryan Mania falls off Stagecoach Jasper, into the path of oncoming horses . There were no gasps of horror - . watching live, things happen too quickly to get a proper perspective - . but when Ryan did not get up immediately, eyes remained on him. Then green protective screens were . erected to treat him in privacy. When races end, the crowd normally slip . away to bars, tearooms or the paddock. But not when things happen like . this. For 25 minutes, Ryan was treated on . the track and a significant number of concerned spectators did not go . anywhere, remaining largely silent and concerned. That silence was broken by the noise . of the air ambulance but the absence of an announcement meant people on . the course were searching for information as he was loaded on to the . aircraft on a spinal board.

The Great North Air Ambulance prepares to take off from Hexham Racecourse next to the fence where Grand National winning jockey Ryan Mania fell today, just 24 hours after he stormed to victory at Aintree on 66-1 outsider Auroras Encore. It seems people watching on television always get more information than those at the track - which is wrong. But clerk of the course James . Armstrong calmed fears, telling me they hoped the situ ation was not as . serious as it looked. Armstrong said: 'His agent and partner are with . him. He has had some scans and they are waiting for the results.' And it was a great relief later to . see that Ryan himself had Tweeted good news, saying: 'Thanks so much for . all the messages.

Just hours after Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected the 256th Pope, President Cristina Kirchner appeared to be gearing up to use Francis I 's powerful new status to Argentina’s advantage. In a televised address Ms Kirchner said she hoped the new Pope would 'take a message to the major world powers that they need to participate in dialogue.' It is feared that if Argentinians interpret the latest development as an intervention by God on their side, it could be a catalyst for nationalism. Kirchner has already said that she hopes the new Pope will take a message to the world's powers telling them they can't ignore the emerging countries . The Argentinian Pope Francis has sparked with Kirchner in the past over Gay marriage and implied that women should not hold office . Tensions between Argentine and British governments grew last year as the 30th anniversary of the war for control of the South Atlantic islands approached. Meanwhile military chiefs have drawn up plans for a 'show of force' to warn off any Buenos Aires sanctioned-aggression after Falkland Islanders voted to remain under UK sovereignty in a referendum this week. Kirchner added that God and the Virgin would also wish just causes to sometimes triumph . After wishing her compatriot luck, Kirchner said: '(We hope) that (his mission) takes the message to the major powers in the world to participate in dialogue ... that the great powers in the world, who have arms and financial power, can be convinced to finally heed the emerging countries and that they commit to a dialogue of civilisations where things are resolved by diplomatic channels rather than by force.' She added pointedly: 'We ask God that he help make it possible that just causes also sometimes triumph in this blessed land we call Earth, because I am sure that God and the Virgin also wish it so.' President Kirchner's relationship with the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires has until now been thorny, the two having engaged in open battle over gay marriage. When the conservative cardinal called for God's War on her government's gay marriage proposals, Kirchner accused him of putting forward ideas 'from the Dark Ages and the Inquisition'. He replied that women were to inept to hold political positions. But given her one time enemy’s new sway, not to mention infallibility, all that seems to be water under the bridge-the Argentine premier has already cleared her diary to fly to Rome for the inaugural mass on Tuesday. Despite their apparent differences, the two share a hostile rhetoric when it comes to the islands. As recently as 2010 Bergoglio declared: ‘The Malvinas are ours.’ Speaking at a Maundy Thursday ceremony a day before the 28th anniversary of the Falklands in April 2010, Bergoglio had urged the Argentinian people to remember those who had fallen during the war'. He said: ‘We must not forget those whose blood was shed on Argentinian soil.’ Kirchner maintains that the Falklands are Argentina's land. Pictured, the 40 Commando, Royal Marines in Port Howard, West Falkland during the war . Argentine soldiers, still with their weapons, waiting to be moved from Port Stanley airport shortly after the surrender of the Falkland Islands to the British force. 'Dialogue is good for everyone, but this dialogue is difficult because it presupposes both sides take small steps. He added: 'Let's not forget. At meetings like these, reconciliation is the right thing to do, but the Malvinas are ours.' And just last year he used a memorial service for the 30th anniversary of the start of the the war to rail at Britain who he accused of ‘usurping’ the islands. During a mass in Buenos Aires on April 2 he told former conscripts and families of those who died: 'We come to pray for those who have fallen, sons of the homeland who set out to defend his mother, the homeland, to claim the country that is theirs and they were usurped. 'Many young people were there and could not return. Others returned but none could forget. 'Many scars, many families destroyed by permanent absence or a return cut short. The country needs to remember them all.'","Kirchner has already asked the Pope to take a message to world powers .

A man who stole £30,000 by sneaking into his ex-wife’s house every week for three years has been escaped jail. Bernard Young, 47, crept into the home of former wife, Lynn, in the middle of the night to steal a debit card for her brother’s bank account. Then he would break back into the house to replace it hours later, Liverpool crown court heard today. Young, who had a key to the former matrimonial home, would withdraw about £180 a time from the account of Terence Ruck, 68, before returning the card to his ex-wife’s handbag. Mrs Young, 46, who separated from the defendant in 2009 after being married for 19 years, only realised the theft when she was shopping with her brother and the card was declined due to insufficient funds. Bernard Young, pictured left, was spared jail for sneaking into the house of his ex-wife Lynn Young, pictured right, taking her brother's bank card and stealing £30,000 from his account . Mr Ruck’s entire life savings - totalling £30,280 - had been taken. The court heard that Mrs Young, from Golborne, near Wigan in Greater Manchester, experienced 'strange things happening' after her separation from Young. Prosecutor Sarah Holt said: 'She would wake in the night and feel very uncomfortable as though someone was in the house. 'But she told herself she was being silly and put it down to being on her own after being in a relationship for a long time.' She told the court that Young had been taking the card and making the secret withdrawals every week for between £150 and £180 over a five-year period and had been sneaking back into his old home since their separation. Mrs Young even told her ex-husband that she sometimes felt that there was someone in the bedroom at night, but he had told her that there was 'nothing to worry about'. Young had started the scam in 2007 when the couple were still married but continued with the fraud after the 19 year marriage collapsed in 2009. Lynn Young, pictured centre with family members supporting her, told the police she was 'devastated that the man to whom she had been married for 19 years could be responsible for the fraud' Young must now pay back the £30,000 he stole from Terence Ruck . A police investigation found CCTV . recordings of Young making withdrawals in the early hours of the morning . and statements showed he had withdrawn £30,280 from 2007 to 2012. Miss Holt told the court that the . couple had been on friendly terms since their separation and Young had . often stayed overnight in the house. She said: 'He was aware she kept her handbag in the bedroom while she was asleep. 'He went into the bedroom, went to her handbag and took the card. 'He made the withdrawals and then went back to the house to place the card back in the bag which was undisturbed. 'This was how he was able to take so much money over such a lengthy period of time.' Mrs . Young later told police that she was 'devastated that the man to whom . she had been married for 19 years could be responsible for the fraud'. Philip . Martin, defending, said that Young was the 'sole bread winner' for the . family and was taking the money to pay household bills. Mr . Martin told the court: 'He was, in a way, trying to woo her but since . she discovered what was happening, this has back fired spectacularly. 'There was no suggestion he was using the money for a lavish lifestyle.' Young, a forklift truck driver, who lives on a barge in Crooke Marina, Wigan, was jailed for 12 months, suspended for two years, after earlier pleading guilty to six counts of fraud by false representation. Mr Martin said that Young, who now . has three young children through another relationship, was in a position . to pay the money back through the sale of his house boat and other . assets. Recorder Nicholas Fewtrell told him that his promise to repay the cash had spared him from going to prison immediately. He said: 'You have led an honest and hard working life so far and it is a great tragedy you find yourself in this position. 'This was despicable conduct but as you are in a position to make reparation I am going to take a more lenient course than I would have otherwise.' Young was also ordered to do 200 hours unpaid community work.","Bernard Young, 47, stole £30,000 from his ex-wife's brother .

With the spiritual wellbeing of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics is on his shoulders he must have quite a to-do list. But despite his new responsibilities, Francis did not forget to stop off -  between engagements - to pay his hotel bill. Staff at the central Rome priests’ residence where Bergoglio was staying before the conclave, were astonished when the newly elected Pope strolled in to collect his luggage and settle the bill. Pope Francis insisted on returning to the hotel to collect his luggage and greet the staff before settling the hotel bill himself . ‘I need to set a good example’ he joked. He was driven to the hotel in a simple car and The Rev. Pawel . Rytel-Andrianek, who teaches at the nearby Pontifical Holy Cross . University and is staying at the residence, said that workers at the . hotel were touched by the Pope's decision to return and bid them . farewell. 'He wanted to come here because he wanted to thank the personnel, people . who work in this house,' he said. 'He greeted them one by one, no rush, . the whole staff, one by one.' Mr Rytel-Andrianek added that Francis . apparently knew everyone by name. A Vatican spokesman said: 'He wanted to get his luggage and the bags. He had left everything there. The Pope also insisted on returning from the election in the minibus rather than in a special papal car . Pope Francis has already displayed his intentions to remain humble and connected to the people . 'He then stopped in the office, greeted everyone and decided to pay the . bill for the room... because he was concerned about giving a good . example of what priests and bishops should do.' Francis is already winning plaudits for his down-to-earth manner. He has so far refused a motorcade and the official papal Jag for official business. And even on the night of the election he insisted on accompanying the other cardinals back to their lodgings, by mini bus, saying: ’I came on the bus, so I’ll go home on the bus.’ Meeting cardinals yesterday on his second day of Papal business he eschewed protocol in favour of kissing on two cheeks, shaking hands and hugging. He told his deputies that old people like himself are ‘like good wine, getting better with age’, before urging them to impart their wisdom to the young. The pontiff and his cardinals eschewed ceremonial robes for simple yellow ones during his first Mass . Insiders in the church are already expressing their belief that pope Francis is the right person to remove its scandalous image . Francis began his reign in unorthodox fashion as he shunned public events in order to pray to the Virgin Mary. During his first Mass since being elected as supreme pontiff, Pope Francis and his cardinals were dressed in simple yellow robes over their cassocks, rather than the formal ceremonial outfits they would normally wear on such a major occasion. Speaking in Italian without notes, he said: 'We can walk all we want, we can build many things, but if we don't proclaim Jesus Christ, something is wrong. We would become a compassionate NGO and not a Church which is the bride of Christ. 'He who does not pray to the Lord prays to the devil. When we don't proclaim Jesus Christ, we proclaim the worldliness of the devil, the worldliness of the demon.' Pope Francis chose to visit the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica early on his first full day as the head of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics showing his dedication to his role as Bishop of Rome . 'We must always walk in the presence of the Lord, in the light of the . Lord, always trying to live in an irreprehensible way,' he said in a . heartfelt homily of a parish priest, loaded with biblical references and . simple imagery. 'When we walk without the cross, when we build without the cross and . when we proclaim Christ without the cross, we are not disciples of the . Lord. We are worldly,' he said . 'We may be bishops, priests, cardinals, popes, all of this, but we are not disciples of the Lord,' he said. It was a far simpler message than the dense, three-page discourse . Benedict delivered in Latin during his first Mass as pope in 2005. The difference in style was a sign of Francis' belief that the Catholic . Church needs to be at one with the people it serves and not impose its . message on a society that often doesn't want to hear it, Francis' authorised biographer, Sergio Rubin, said. Francis took the helm of the 1.2 billion-member Church at a time of strife and intrigue, with the Vatican rocked by a string of sex abuse scandals, accusations of infighting within its central government and by allegations of financial wrongdoing.

'It seems to me for now what is certain is it's a great change of style, which for us isn't a small thing,' Mr Rubin said, recalling how the former Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio would celebrate Masses with homeless people and prostitutes in Buenos Aires. 'He believes the church has to go to the streets,' he said, 'to express this closeness of the church and this accompaniment with those who are suffering.'","Pope Francis insisted on returning to his hotel to settle the bill himself .

Guilty: Sam Hurd (pictured watching Chicago Bears teammates in 2011) has pleaded guilty to drug-possession . Former NFL wide receiver Sam Hurd pleaded guilty to drug-possession in court today, after being charged with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana. The 27-year-old, who is facing significant jail time, sat in Dallas federal court and his trial is scheduled to begin on Monday. Prosecutors allege Hurd was trying to obtain large amounts of cocaine and marijuana to build a drug-distribution network. Hurd was arrested in December 2011 after allegedly accepting cocaine from an undercover officer at a Chicago-area steakhouse. At the time, Hurd was a player for the Chicago Bears. Prosecutors alleged he told the officer . and an informant at the steakhouse that he wanted to purchase up to 10 . kilograms of cocaine a week for $25,000 per kilogram. Hurd played five seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before signing with the Bears in 2011. He was released after his arrest. Hurd pleaded guilty to one count of possession of cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute and a federal judge had refused his attorney's request to delay his trial. Prosecutors and Hurd's attorneys have been in plea discussions for months, according to one of his attorneys, Jay Ethington. One sticking point was what allegations Hurd would acknowledge in a plea agreement, which will factor into his recommended sentence on the indictment, Ethington said in September.

"By . Des Kelly . PUBLISHED: . 19:01 EST, 28 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:39 EST, 29 December 2012 . The compilation of the honours list has always been something of a murky affair. The perception lingers that a nudge here, a wink there and a generous donation to the right account does no harm at all to one's prospects of a knighthood. Trot along to one of the Prime Minister's barbecues in Buckinghamshire and the chances of the Queen pinning something on your lapel at Buckingham Palace a few months later also appear to improve somewhat. Civil servants, politicians and bankers pick up gongs for doing little more than their day job, while, according to a report earlier this year by the ­Commons public administration select committee, it still remains the case that not enough 'normal people' are being recognised on the list. No Sir MoBot: Double Olympic gold medalist Mo Farah will receive a CBE and not a knighthood . But the relationship between sport and honours has always been more straightforward. It is essentially a ­meritocracy, stripped of politicking and intrigue. If you win, you are rewarded. Glories equal honour. ­Medals equal gongs. In fact, we don't want our sports stars to be 'normal' at all. The trouble this year is they were too extraordinary. The gold rush of a glorious Olympic summer where Team GB collected 29 gold medals led Downing Street to issue curmudgeonly briefings about how there would be an honours 'cutback' even before another 34 golds at the Paralympics. Faced with the prospect of nearly half the audience at the Sports Personality Of The Year Awards being called Dame This or Sir That, the Prime Minister called a halt. As a result there is no Sir MoBot. No Sir Andy of ­Dunblane. No Dame Jessica of the Steel City, either. In any other year, this illustrious trio would have been guaranteed the very highest accolades of the land for their inspirational performances. They not only succeeded in their chosen fields, their golden glow was reflected across the nation as they brought the country together for moments of collective joy and patriotism, the intensity of which has rarely been seen before. But on this occasion, they have had to drop down a rung or two, 'victims' of our incredible sporting success, if we dare use such a word in this context. Inconsistent: Paralympian Sarah Storey is a Dame but David Weir is given a CBE instead of a knighthood . When Kelly Holmes took double gold on the track in Athens in 2004, she was made a Dame without argument. When Mo Farah achieved a similar feat in London this summer winning the 5,000m and 10,000m, he was handed a citation for a CBE instead. Paralympian Sarah Storey is a Dame, but all-­conquering wheelchair athlete David Weir is not named a knight, he has a CBE. There are only so many knights and dames a nation can accommodate, even on a special Olympic honours list. But it is not a snub to miss out and it would churlish to regard it as such. Murky affair: Pop along to one of the Prime Ministers barbecues in Buckinghamshire and your chances of getting a gong appear to improve . Some of the sports stars not being called to the Palace this year have long careers ahead and there is time enough for knighthoods, honours and accolades. What might seem like a contradiction now can surely be addressed in lists ahead. At least cycling has two knights of the road; Sir Dave Brailsford for his pursuit of excellence with the British team and Sir Bradley Wiggins, or Sir Wiggo as he will surely be known, for his historic Tour de France triumph and Olympic gold. There are two Sirs on the waves as well, with David Tanner, performance director of Britain's rowing team and sailor Ben Ainslie collecting knighthoods. But being a history-maker is not necessarily enough. When Andy Murray finally landed Britain's first men's Grand Slam tennis title in 76 years at the US Open during an era when men's tennis is as strong as it has ever been, he still admitted it 'would be a little rash' to give him a knighthood. The committee agreed, handing him an OBE. The idea that he has been denied, though, is preposterous. Murray is 25. To make him Sir Andy at 25 would be premature in the extreme. Fred Perry, Britain's last great men's tennis champion, was never given an honour. However it is certainly a far cry from the list of 2003 when Tim Henman was given an OBE just to 'add interest' to the list. In truth, no athlete, sportsman or sportswoman competes with these ceremonial honours in mind. The distinction that truly counts is the medal hung around their neck on the podium or the trophy they receive at the climax to a tournament. Sports stars receive honours enough, and most of them would happily cede their place on the list to a charity worker or a member of the Armed Forces if that were the choice. But as a nation we enjoy having sporting heroes and it is a fine problem to have too many for once. Who said the honours system was ever consistent, anyway? Want the proof? Some inherit a title because their father was made a Baronet, like Sir Mark Thatcher. And then there's Sir Jimmy Savile. I could go on. Missing out: Tennis star Andy Murray will not be knighted but will be awarded the OBE instead .","A trip to the PM's barbecue also appears to improve your chances of a gong .

The U.S. constitution bans double jeopardy, or being tried twice for the same crime; however, Italy’s courts have no such law, meaning that they will use the same evidence to try the 25-year-old for the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher. Legal experts say Italy’s Supreme Court decision could throw both countries into uncharted territory, as it is highly unlikely the U.S. will extradite Knox to face trial. Extradited? Amanda Knox, pictured in 2011 at Sea-Tac International Airport, is unlikely to ever return to Italy after the country's top court ordered a retrial in the murder of Meredith Kercher . Statement: Knox, pictured in Italian court in 2011, released a statement saying she and her family would remain 'confident in the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful accusations and unreasonable adversity' Overturned: Italy's Court of Cassation, in Rome, overturned its original ruling and is seeking a retrial; the U.S. Constitution bans double jeopardy, or a second trial for the same crime . Knox’s Italian lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said it was unlikely that his client does not intend to return to Italy to face trial, which would likely take place this year or next. However, Knox can be tried in absentia. ‘Amanda does not intend to come back for the retrial,' he said. 'Her home is in . Seattle and she doesn’t need to be here.’ He added that the decision to order a . new trial was shocking. ‘She thought that the nightmare was over,’ he . said on the steps of the courthouse. ‘But she’s ready to fight.’ When the Italian courts reach a final decision they can also ask for her extradition, the lawyer told Reuters. At that point, the U.S. Department of State would have to weigh in on the request and make its own decision. The state department would then turn to the U.S. Attorney’s Office to seek the Seattle resident’s extradition. A State Department official told MailOnline that the matter is currently in the jurisdiction of the Italian courts. 'As such,' the spokesperson said, 'the State Department will refrain from making any further comment.' Retrial: Amanda Knox holds hands with her boyfriend James Terrano in downtown Seattle on Sunday. She spoken of her anguish after Italy's highest criminal court overturned her acquittal for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher . Questions: Meredith Kercher's sister Stephanie Kercher, 29,  left, said at her family's home in Coulsdon, Surrey, said: 'There are a lot of unanswered questions still'. Right, her sister before her 2007 death . Regardless of the outcome, the new trial will prove to be an expensive and emotionally-charged spectacle. After the court’s decision, the . attractive brunette struck back. ‘No matter what happens, my family and I . will face this continuing legal battle as we always have, confident in . the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful . accusations and unreasonable adversity,’ she said in a statement. The 25-year-old has largely avoided . the public eye since returning to Seattle, Washington, and has been . spotted around the town running errands and resuming her studies. Her memoir, ‘Waiting to be Heard,’ is due out in April. Meredith Kercher, 21, a Leeds . University student, was found semi-naked with her throat cut in the . bedroom of the house she shared with Knox, in Perugia in November 2007. The first trial caused a stir as both . Knox and Sollicito were acquitted of Kercher’s murder, and a polarizing . divide in national thought – Americans largely understood the two to be . innocent, while the British believed them to be getting away with . murder. The initial trial also put Knox’s . character in the forefront as prosecutors painted the brunette American . student as a sexual deviant who experimented with marijuana. But in 2011, the evidence was re-visited and much of it was found to be ‘contaminated.’ Meredith's sister Stephanie and mother Arline welcomed the news about the retrial on Tuesday . Jailed: Knox, 25, and Sollecito, 29, spent four years in jail, but were freed on appeal in 2011 largely on the grounds DNA evidence was flawed . Knox and Sollecito spoke on the phone . soon after yesterday’s verdict. Sollecito’s current girlfriend Annie . Achille said: ‘They will see what can be done.’ She added that her . boyfriend, who turned 29 yesterday, is ‘destroyed’ and not talking to . anyone. Meredith Kercher, from Coulsdon, . Surrey, was in Italy as an exchange student from Leeds University. She . was found dead in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the . picturesque hilltop town of Perugia. Her throat had been slit and her . semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet. After a lengthy trial in . Perugia, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the murder in December . 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively. But two years later, the pair were . freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and DNA . evidence contaminated. A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA . and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a . 16-year prison sentence, reduced from 30 years on appeal. Meredith’s family welcomed yesterday’s . judgment. Her sister Stephanie said: ‘We are never going to be happy . about any outcome because we have still lost Meredith but we obviously . support the decision and hope to get answers from it. There are still so . many unanswered questions. All we have ever wanted to do is do what we . can for Meredith and to find out the truth of what happened that night.’ Knox had rejoiced after her conviction . was sensationally overturned in 2011. She fled Italy within hours, . returning home to the US, where she quickly embraced life as a free . woman. She now shares a flat with boyfriend James Terrano, a classical . guitarist, and is studying at the University of Washington in Seattle, . where she can be near her parents and three sisters. The former student is preparing for . the publication next month of  a memoir for which she has been paid a . reported $3.8million.

Sollecito remained in Italy and is studying . robotic surgery at the University of Verona. He has already released a . book about his experience. In it he said that he and Knox were still in . touch – he visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype . regularly. Sollecito’s lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said: ‘We are still strong. This is not a sentence in itself: this is just an annulment.’ Knox’s appeal against her conviction . for slander – for having falsely accused her boss Patrick Lumumba of the . murder – was rejected. She has already served the three-year prison . sentence for that conviction, but was ordered to pay Lumumba €4,000 ($5,100) in . costs. The retrial will be held in Florence, with different judges, to avoid accusations of prejudice against the accused pair. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were seen kissing in the wake of the murder . Rudy Guede was identified by police after his bloody fingerprint was found on a cushion at the scene of the crime. The . 21-year-old Ivory Coast national had given his fingerprints when he . applied for an Italian identity card several years earlier. He was known to police as a petty thief and small time drug dealer. Guede . had arrived in Italy in 1992 as a five year-old child with his father . Roger, who left his wife behind in west Africa to seek work in Italy . where he had a sister. But . when Guede was 15 Roger went back to Africa, leaving his son behind in . the care of, remarkably, a multi-millionaire Paolo Caporali who had . occasionally employed the boy in odd jobs. In . the summer of 2007, Guede rented a flat in the centre of Perugia and . became friendly with four male students who lived in the flat below Miss . Kercher and Knox. In . September and October Guede was linked to three break-ins - two in . Perugia and one in Milan. He also carried out another break-in at the . offices of a local lawyer in Perugia and at the end of October he was . arrested in Milan after breaking into a school. Following the murder he fled Perugia and went to Germany on a train. He was arrested there and extradited back to Italy. In . October 2008 he was sentenced to 30 years in jail for the murder and . sexual assault of Miss Kercher after opting for a fast-track trial. The day before his arrest on suspicion of Meredith Kercher's murder, Patrick Lumumba had been handing out flyers publicising a candlelit vigil in her memory. Mr Lumumba, a well-known and popular figure in Perugia for a decade, . was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is believed to be . related to murdered Congolese prime minister Patrice Lumumba. He arrived . in Italy legally in 1988. Married with a young child, he opened a . bar and restaurant called Le Chic on a narrow street in Perugia town . centre in August 2007. The same month that Miss Kercher arrived to begin a . short Italian course. He employed her housemate Amanda Knox to help him with promotional work, before firing her for flirting with customers. He believes Knox took her revenge by framing him for Miss Kercher's murder. Mr . Lumumba was arrested on suspicion of causing her death on November 6. He spent two weeks in prison before being able to prove that he spent . the night of the killing talking to a customer in his pub. In 2009  he sued Knox for wrongly accusing him of the crime.","Meredith, 21, was found dead in the house she and Knox shared in Perugia .

War and Peace, one of the greatest novels of all time, is to be turned into an epic television drama by the BBC. Leo Tolstoy's classic book will be made into a six-part series, it has been announced today. It will written by the award-winning scriptwriter Andrew Davies,  who is best known for his adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, Little Dorrit and Bleak House. Although the castings have yet to be announced, Les Miserables star Eddie Redmayne has been tipped to take up one of leading roles. BBC controller Danny Cohen said: 'War And Peace is truly epic in scale and builds on BBC One's commitment to bringing audiences drama of the highest quality and impact. Les Miserables star Eddie Redmayne has been tipped to feature in the BBC's adaptation of War and Peace, which will be screened in 2015 . 'Told over six episodes, Andrew Davies will bring his exceptional powers of adaptation to this literary masterpiece.' The adaptation will be screened on BBC One in 2015 and will be the first adaptation of the novel on British television for 40 years. The iconic book was transformed into a memorable 20-part series in 1972, starring Anthony Hopkins. First published in 1869, the book follows the lives of aristocratic families affected by the French invasion of Russia in the early 19th century. Widely regarded as one of the greatest novels of all time, Andrew Davies scripts are expected to draw all the elements into powerful focus for a modern audience. Veteran screenwriter Davies, who also scripted the Bridget Jones films and the popular ITV drama Mr Selfridge, said: 'Not just a great novel, it’s a wonderful read and it’ll make a wonderful serial. 'A thrilling, funny and heartbreaking story of love, war and family life. Award-winning screenwriter Andrew Davies, who is best known for his adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, Little Dorrit and Bleak House has been tasked with writing the new War and Peace adaptation . 'The characters are so natural and human and easy to identify with and Natasha Rostova just beats Lizzy Bennet as the most lovable heroine in literature.' Davies has said that although he won't dumb down the novel, it will contain all the drama of Britain's best-loved soap operas. He said the adaptation will focus less on the philosophical strands, and more on the human relationships, romance and family struggles. Davies played down the notorious length of the original novel, which has a total of 1,225 pages. 'It's nothing to be frightened of. These people are just like us; their emotions are so recognisable,' he told the Telegraph. 'At the heart of the book, it is a story of four families, with certain characters we get to care about and love very much.' Sir Anthony Hopkins as Count Pierre Bezuhov in the BBC's last War and Peace adaptation in 1972 . He joked that the interaction between characters and families would be 'very familiar' to fans of the soap opera Eastenders, but with 'not so much yelling and nobody on the dole'. Davies has expressed his desire to cast an unknown actress to play Natasha Rostova. But he said the roles of male protagonists Pierre and Andrei will be played by more experienced actors. Actor and model Eddie Redmayne is the favourite to play one of the lead roles, but Bafta award-winning writer Davies refused to speculate about prospective stars. War and Peace was last shown on the BBC in 1972, with Sir Anthony Hopkins in the role of Pierre, while Audrey Hepburn starred in a film version in 1956. Faith Penhale, executive producer and . head of drama at BBC Wales, said: 'Andrew Davies is the master of the . classic adaptation and it’s thrilling to be able to bring War And Peace, . with its rich cast of characters and epic drama, to BBC One. 'Today’s . audience will be drawn into the sweeping story of life and love during a . time of conflict, with a dazzling production that brings to life the . great vision and scale of the novel.'","BBC announced it is turning classic book War and Peace into epic TV drama .

Finally off the dole: Mick Philpott will be made to work as a cleaner at Wakefield Prison once he comes off suicide watch after being jailed for life for killing six of his children in a house fire . Child-killing benefits scrounger Mick Philpott is finally being forced to get a job - as a prison cleaner. The father-of-17, who hasn't worked for ten years, claimed tens of thousands in state hand-outs before being jailed last week for burning six of his children to death. Now he faces having to mop floors at notorious high-security Wakefield Prison for just £14 a week, it was reported by The Sun. He will be punished if he refuses. A source told the paper: 'He is used to getting his women and kids to do all the work for him — but he won’t just be able to lean on the mop for half an hour and say he’s done. 'Officers will inspect his handiwork and report to the governor. The same goes for the cleanliness of his cell.' His £14 wage can be spent on cigarettes and sweets, but this will be axed if he doesn't pull his weight. Philpott, 56, has not done a proper day's work since 2003 and has not held a full-time job since 1991. Instead, he claimed the equivalent of a £100,000 salary in benefits for the 11 children in his custody and the wages from wife, Mairead, and live-in lover, Lisa Willis, which he forced them to pay into his bank account. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years for killing children Duwayne, 13, Jade, ten, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five. Mairead, and best friend Paul Mosley were also jailed for 17 years for manslaughter. Philpott will be put to work once he is off suicide watch at Wakefield - also known as Monster Mansions - where some of Britain's most dangerous criminals are held. But it is possible he will never have to take up the cleaning job as he may need to be locked up in solitary confinement for his entire life sentence to protect him from attacks, it was reported in The Daily Star. Prison bosses fear it will never be safe for him to mingle with other inmates after reportedly learning of two separate plots to target him just days into his term. Not for the faint-hearted: Philpott will be made to scrub his wing at notorious Wakefield Prison (pictured) where some of Britain's most dangerous criminals are held . Hate figure: Philpott may have to locked up in solitary confinement at Wakefield Prison for his entire life sentence over fears he will forever be the target of attacks by other inmates . Neighbours from hell: Other inmates being held at Wakefield include 'Britain's most-violent prisoner' Charles Bronson (left) and child killer Levi Bellfield (right) One of those has apparently come from a group of gypsies who gave him £3,000 thinking his children were victims of a mystery arsonist. He is currently being housed in a Perspex-fronted cell and prison bosses do not see 'any immediate prospect' of him being transferred to a normal wing. Guards can monitor him 24 hours a day and he will wear special clothes that cannot be torn into strips to make a noose. Keeping him in isolation would double the cost of housing a prisoner on an ordinary unit from £600,000 to £1.2million. A source told the Daily Star: 'While he is in the plastic-fronted cell, he is as safe as any prisoner in the country. But threats are already coming in.' Victims and killer: Philpott was jailed for killing children Duwayne, 13, Jade, ten, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five. His wife, Mairead, and friend Paul Mosley were also jailed for 17 years for manslaughter . Horrific reminder: The scorched home where the Philpott children died will now be bulldozed in an attempt to help the community move on from the tragedy . Child benefit . Philpott: £20.30 a week for eldest son, £13.40 for the other ten. Yearly total: £8,023.60p . Working tax credits . Mairead: Up to £20,560 a year for her six children . Lisa Willis: Up to £17,870 for her five children . Estimated earnings from their cleaning jobs: £14,000 . Yearly total: £38,430 . Housing benefit . Philpott: £150 a week . Yearly total: £7,800 . ESTIMATED GRAND TOTAL: £68,000 . This is the approximate take-home pay of someone earning £100,000 . It is thought Philpott will eventually be placed in the segregation area away from the main prison population. But the unit is still home to Britain’s most violent inmate, 60-year-old Charles Bronson, who has moved prisons 120 times due to his long record of attacks on staff and other prisoners. The West Yorkshire jail is also home to child murderers Levi Bellfield, 44, and Robert Black, 65. It is where Soham murderer Ian Huntley, 39, was attacked and where serial killer Dr Harold Shipman, 57, hanged himself. Philpott will exercise alone, supervised by three guards so he cannot be attacked en route to the yard or gym. He will eat all his meals in his cell, and everything he does will be recorded in a log. A source said: 'Philpott is going to be looking over his shoulder for the next 15 years.' Philpott masterminded the botched . attempt to frame Miss Willis, who had moved out of their family home in . Allenton, Derby, earlier in the year with her five children, taking with . her the £1,000 a month they were worth in benefit payments. The . scorched home where the Philpott children died will now be bulldozed in . an attempt to help the community move on from the tragedy. Sickening behaviour: CCTV captures trilby-wearing Mick Philpott taking the microphone to perform karaoke just days after killing six of his children in the blaze . Despicable betrayal: Philpott and his wife Mairead put on a tearful performance at a press conference appealing for information about the fire knowing full well it was them who killed the children . Yesterday, CCTV footage emerged of the moment Philpott was seen drunk and swaying in a T-shirt and trilby, while performing karaoke at a pub party just days after the blaze. Locals watched in disgust as he downed shots, embraced his wife Mairead and took centre stage to sing Elvis Presley’s hit Suspicious Minds. The bizarre behaviour in the wake of the deaths prompted witnesses to call the police, who arrested the couple just nine hours later. On May 26 last year, just 15 days after the fatal fire, Philpott and his wife went to the Navigation Inn in Derby, located across the road from the conference centre where they sobbed for the cameras days earlier at a now infamous press conference. They arrived at about 4.30pm and were seen drinking vodka, gin, rum and Jack Daniel’s before Philpott, clearly revelling in the attention, got up to the microphone. He sang the 1975 Elvis classic Suspicious Minds, with the line: ‘We’re caught in a trap, I can’t walk out, because I love you too much baby.’ A number of people who had seen the performance were so stunned they called the police to report them acting suspiciously. Staff at the pub then handed the CCTV footage to officers.","Benefits scrounger 'to scrub floors' when he comes off suicide watch .

Troubled ex-Premier League striker Nile Ranger was handed a 12-month community order today for pulling his girlfriend's hair during a row. The 21-year-old former Newcastle United player admitted common assault on Shakira Bicar outside the city's Gate entertainment complex at around 7pm on March 13. London-born Ranger was released by Newcastle United following a series of off-pitch problems and his solicitor said he hoped to resume his football career in the summer. Scroll down for video . 'Regrets his behaviour': Ex-Newcastle united footballer Nile Ranger leaves court after being handed a community order for pulling his girlfriend's hair during a row . Newcastle Magistrates' Court heard that the row happened when Ms Bicar was out with a male work colleague to organise a social event. Ranger repeatedly contacted her on her phone and the couple then argued in the street. Witnesses heard him tell someone on the phone 'I'm going to grab her'. During a struggle, she kicked his leg and he pulled her by the hair towards the Gate car park in Newcastle city centre. Witnesses called the police and, when he was arrested, he told officers: 'I grabbed her, yeah, I grabbed her.' Chairman of the Bench Chris Robinson ordered the player to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work during a 12-month community order, nine months of which will be supervised. Ranger offered to pay the £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge immediately. Troubled: Ranger, pictured (left) outside Newcastle Magistrates' Court and (right) in action for Newcastle United, was released by the club earlier this year following a series of off-pitch problems . No order was made for compensation as there was a possibility of reconciliation, the court heard. Mr Robinson said Ranger must also address 'gambling issues', but did not reveal any further details in open court. Ranger, who wore a grey suit, white shirt, black tie and black trainers for the hearing, declined to comment as he left court and was driven away in an Audi A3. During the hearing, Geoffrey Forrester, mitigating, said Ranger, who pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, 'regrets his behaviour and apologises for it'. Mr Forrester added: 'He has paid a heavy price for this. He has had to leave Newcastle United FC by way of settlement. It was not something he wanted to do. 'He brought it upon himself, he has to move on with his life.' The solicitor said Ranger would welcome unpaid work to 'give something back' and make amends for his behaviour, before resuming his football career in the summer. Ms Bicar, Ranger's girlfriend for three years, did not make a complaint to police but did tell officers at the scene that she had a sore neck. She said later she did not want a restraining order put in place. The court heard that there had been previous 'domestic incidents' between the couple at Ranger's house in Forest Hall, North Tyneside, which required the police, but there had never been a formal complaint. Dealing with Ranger's previous convictions for drink-driving, battery and being drunk and disorderly, Mr Forrester said they happened within a six-week period in autumn 2011, and that the battery offences for which he was given 12-month conditional discharge happened when he struggled with police having been racially abused in the street by others.

The Duke of Cambridge has spoken of his close bonds with fellow RAF search and rescue crewmates in a new documentary that shows him at work. William described colleagues as 'family' and highlighted his responsibilities captaining rescue efforts during the BBC Wales series about the search and rescue service. Interviewed for the four-part series Flight Lieutenant William Wales, as the royal is known in the RAF, said: 'In this job if you have friends and you have guys you get on with, you've got to have some fun, you've got to have some laughs. Scroll down for video . Starring role: Prince William is seen planning a mission during a BBC documentary that shows him at work as an RAF search and rescue pilot . At the controls: William flies with three colleagues - a winchman and paramedic, co-pilot and winch operator - whom he describes as his 'family' 'At the end of the day you're operating sometimes in some really dodgy and quite dangerous conditions, you have to rely on each other quite a lot and so getting to know each other, being a family is all part of that.' William flies with three colleagues - a winchman and paramedic, co-pilot and winch operator - but the individuals can change from shift to shift. The first installment of the documentary series is screened next week and shows William flying a Sea King helicopter to rescue a 15-year-old boy who has fallen off a railway bridge onto some rocks in the Maenofferen slate quarry in the north Wales town of Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd. The Duke and his crewmates are seen trying to pinpoint the casualty - who has damaged his ribs and is drifting in and out of consciousness - but are hampered by bright sunlight which throws dark shadows onto the ground.

William is the first to spot the injured boy and he soon tells his colleagues and lands so the paramedic can assess the teenager. But the helicopter is low on fuel and the royal flies off to refuel leaving behind winchman/paramedic Master Aircrewman Richard Taylor to look after the 15-year-old.

Suffered appalling neglect: The family of former nurse Rita Smith (pictured) who died after contracting MRSA at a care home have received a five-figure compensation payout . The family of a retired Red Cross nurse whose body became 'fused' in the foetal position after being left for up to 13 hours without being turned have received a five-figure pay out. Rita Smith, 74, died after developing MRSA as a result of months of appalling neglect by staff at a care home. The retired nurse had spent 35 years . teaching first aid and had campaigned for greater care for the elderly . as well as volunteering in prisons and colleges. But after developing dementia, her family paid £2,000-a-month for her to have round-the-clock care at Waterloo House care home in Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, in March 2008. Her GP put a care plan in place which stipulated the grandmother-of-two needed to be turned every two hours to prevent her joints becoming stiff. But six months later, doctors discovered she was weak, dehydrated and suffering from pressure sores. Records showed on one occasion she was not turned for a shocking 13 hours. Her joints were so stiff she had become fused into the foetal position and she was transferred to Warwick Hospital where doctors discovered a pressure sore on her bottom which was graded at level four - . the most serious grading. It was discovered the sore had become . infected with MRSA and she was treated for blood poisoning before being . transferred to Ellen Badger Hospital, in Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire, on November 21, 2008, but died just three days later. Her family sued the care home and last week Alpha Care Homes Ltd, which runs Waterloo House, agreed a five figure sum out-of-court settlement. Today, her daughter Debbie Wride blasted care staff for their 'unforgivable' care. She said: 'When she was admitted to hospital, . doctors told us that her body was fused in the foetal position, . suggesting it was likely because she had barely been turned. 'Mum was in a very vulnerable condition, but we all put our trust in the care home believing that they were doing their best for her. 'They reassured us they could care for her needs, but as the weeks went by we started to seriously question the quality of care she was given. 'Mum was passionate about teaching high standards of nursing care. For her to die in this way is unforgivable. 'Totally let down': Mrs Smith's family paid £2,000-a-month for her to have round-the-clock care at Waterloo House care home (pictured) in Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, after she developed dementia . 'Mum used to always say one of the fundamentals of nursing care was to make sure that your patient avoided a pressure sore' She added: 'She dedicated her life to caring for others, but when she was reliant upon others to care for her, she was totally let down. 'She spent her last weeks in agony and did not get the care she deserved. Her death has devastated the entire family. 'We are so angry about the level of care she received, from a care home that she was paying over £2,000 per month of her hard earned savings for. 'But this was never about the money, we've never had an apology and we still do not feel we have all the answers as to why she was not regularly turned by care home staff who should have known better.' Lucy Erskine, a solicitor for Irwin Mitchell who represented the family, said: 'Despite a very clear care plan, the instructions were not fully implemented by the care home staff.

'Risk inherent part of job': Chief constable Mike Cunningham, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, has criticised a decision by an officer to demand compensation from a garage owner after injuring herself on a 999 call . A chief constable today added his voice to growing anger over the Kelly Jones compensation case by saying it was 'wholly inappropriate' for police officers to make claims against victims of crime. Mike Cunningham, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, spoke out after Pc Jones was criticised for taking legal action against a petrol station owner after she tripped on a kerb answering a 999 call. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May stepped into the row over the weekend by ordering a review of all such compensation cases involving the police. Pc Jones is making a claim against . Steve Jones, 50, the owner of Nuns' Bridges Filling Station in Thetford, . Norfolk, for failing to ensure she was 'reasonably safe' when she . attended a suspected break-in in August 2012. After . her astonishing claim became public, her own Chief Constable, Phil . Gormley, criticised it as ‘surprising and disappointing’. Mr . Cunningham told ITV's Daybreak programme: 'It is, to me, wholly . inappropriate that police officers claim compensation against victims of . crime, people to whom we have responded in order to help them. 'However, . there are occasions, and I think many members of the public would . accept and understand this, when an officer is badly assaulted on duty . and loses earnings as a result; then it may be that they should have . access to the criminal injuries compensation scheme along with everybody . else.' Mr Cunningham, who is Chief Constable . of the Staffordshire force, added: 'I think it is self-evident that risk . is an inherent part of being a police officer and when police officers . join they absolutely know that and are aware of it. 'In . fact, it is one of the appeals of the job that police officers put . themselves between harm and victims, and that's what we do. 'There . are occasions when officers unfortunately will be injured as a result . of the profession they have chosen and it is in those circumstances when . the issue of compensation arises.' Centre of national row: WPC Jones (pictured with her father Danny Harle on her first day as a police officer) has been criticised for taking legal action against a petrol station owner after she tripped on a kerb on a 999 call . Accident scene: The petrol station in Thetford, Norfolk, where WPC Kelly Jones tripped on the kerb while responding to a 999 call . Sources say Mrs May fears that the trend for officers to sue could deter victims from reporting crimes. Mrs . May’s action follows not only the Jones case, but an incident where a . policeman is suing a burglary victim for £10,000 after allegedly falling . into a drain while investigating a break-in at West Horsley, Surrey. PC Richard Seymour is claiming against shop-owner Stuart Lambley for ‘loss of overtime’ despite being on full pay throughout. Mrs May will ask for a review of such cases when she returns to work from holiday today. She . is said to believe it is unreasonable for police to demand compensation . for minor injuries in their normal line of duty, and their right to sue . burglary victims for injuries sustained while chasing criminals may now . be curbed. Critical: Pc Jones's own Chief Constable, Phil Gormley (left), described her claim as ‘surprising and disappointing’, while Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered a review of police compensation cases . A Home Office source said: ‘It seems . wrong that a PC should sue someone who reports a crime for a minor . injury.  There would be serious concerns if it deterred people from . reporting crimes. ‘Similarly, . common sense tells you that owing to the nature of their work, police . may suffer a few cuts and bruises. It would be wrong for them to put in a . claim for compensation every time this happens.‘The victims of crime have the right to be treated as such, not turned into criminals themselves.’ PC Jones is also demanding compensation . from her own force after she was in a police car which skidded off the . road and ended on its side during a chase in January last year. She put in a compensation claim . to Norfolk Constabulary, which would not discuss details. Her lawyers . said she injured her knee and her employers accepted liability. Another claim: Pc Jones is also demanding compensation from her own force after she was in a police car like this one which skidded off the road and ended on its side during a chase in January last year . Her lawyers, Pattinson Brewer, said: ‘Kelly believes she has the right to go to work and not be harmed by someone else’s negligence.’ The Police Federation is backing PC Jones’s action against Mr Jones, who is not related to the officer. It says she wants to claw back ‘lost earnings’. But it is understood she has lost only overtime and night shift pay as she was on a full salary while recovering from both incidents. PC Jones is on sick leave but is due back on active duty soon. A total of £67.1 million has been paid out to injured officers in settlements in the four years from 2009 to 2012, figures from the federation showed.","Chief constable Mike Cunningham speaks out as Home Secretary orders review of cases .

Resembling a giant saucer, the tech giant's Campus 2 will be nestled in a dense jungle of trees near the 280 Highway in Silicon Valley and will house some 13,000 staff. But the fact there will not be a single piece of straight glass on the entire building is thought to be one of the reasons for the rising costs. Its completion date has also been pushed back from 2015 to the following year. Astronomical costs: Plans for Apple's new 'UFO' office complex (above) are $2billion over budget, it has been claimed by sources close to the project . Complex operation: The fact there will not be a single piece of straight glass on the building is thought to be one of the reasons for the delay and rising costs because the manufacture is having to double its factory capacity . Seele, the German company tasked with producing the curved glass, is having to double its factory capacity to finish the project, it was reported by The Verge. Normally the firm deals 'in terms of square feet' but it now has to manufacture something like six square kilometres of glass to cover the 2.8million sq ft HQ. The building was initially expected to cost under $3billion, but this has now ballooned to nearly $5billion, according to five sources close to the project who spoke to Bloomberg Business Week. This would eclipse the $3.9billion being spent on the new World Trade Centre complex in New York.

Sneeky: Divorcee Paul Lapping (pictured) falsely claimed £45,000 in benefits after failing to declare a £125,000 inheritance which he used to pursue a transatlantic romance with a Canadian woman . A benefits cheat paid for his transatlantic love life after fiddling more than £45,000 in handouts - and blew thousands on exotic holidays, a court heard today. Paul Lapping, 53, falsely claimed state benefits as he jetted more than four thousands miles to romance a Canadian woman. The divorcee failed to tell authorities about getting a £125,000 inheritance from his family - and carried on claiming disability benefits as he flew across the Atlantic. He used the inheritance to buy a $80,000 (£50,000) love shack near Toronto after falling for the Canadian woman. The court heard Lapping also spent another £17,500 on exotic holidays while claiming income support. Prosecutor Stuart McLeese said an investigation into Lapping's transatlantic love life was launched after a tip-off from the public. Mr McLeese said: 'He had bought a property in Canada for $80,000 in 2006. 'Lapping had fallen in love with a woman in Canada and bought a property which he sold in 2011. 'However, he failed to tell the authorities this and the fact that he had received an inheritance of £125,000. 'Lapping was interviewed twice last year and in the first interview said he received £17,500 from the sale of the Canada property.' The court heard how Lapping and his Canadian girlfriend broke up after less than a year together. Heartbroken Lapping put their love nest up for sale and moved back to the UK. He went on to blow both his £125,000 inheritance and the £17,500 he got for the Canadian house on exotic holidays. Wheelchair-bound Lapping was now getting benefits after spending the windfall cash. Mr McLeese said the total overpayment in Income Support, housing benefit and Council tax benefit was £45,872. He said the money was being paid back at a rate of £14.20 a fortnight. Judge Paul Thomas QC said that if Lapping lived to be 100 he 'may get somewhere to paying it off'. 4,000-mile fling: Lapping split his time between a Toronto love shack he bought for £50,000 and his home in Swansea (above) Lapping pleaded guilty to obtaining benefit by deception and two counts of failing to notify of a change in circumstances. Ian Wright, mitigating, said Lapping . was left in a wheelchair after his motorcycle which crashed with a car . more than 30 years ago. Judge Thomas said Lapping was 'motivated by pure greed'. He said: 'The country can ill afford it had lost out to the sum of more than £45,000.' Lapping was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment suspended for two years. Judge Thomas also ordered he do 300 . hours of unpaid work and told him: 'You have taken away from society and . you should make as big a contribution back as I can order.' Lapping lives in a semi-detached, downstairs flat in the West Cross area of Swansea, near the popular holiday resort of Mumbles. Speaking after the case, neighbour . Ann Evans said: 'We all knew he had a lot of money from his inheritance . and that it kept him ticking over. 'I can't believe he was claiming benefits on top of that - it really does take the mick.' Lapping's red brick property has a satellite TV dish and CCTV cameras fixed to the side. Ann, who has lived in the area for 10 years, added: 'He moved in a couple of years ago but we have never got on. 'I don't think he's a very nice person, I've always thought he was trouble with a capital T.

Americans are searching the web for information about North Korea with astonishing frequency, vastly outstripping those for Barack Obama and Beyonce, it emerged today. Google searches for the pariah state, which has the world on high alert over its nuclear ambitions, are seven times the previous peak in 2006 when it carried out an atom bomb test. Last week, the term 'North Korea' was the third-most popular on Twitter, only behind Easter and Good Friday. Popularity contest: Americans are searching online for information about North Korea and its warmongering dictator Kim Jong Un (left) far more frequently than global pop star Beyonce (right) Not so interesting: Search terms for North Korea are also outstripping those for President Barack Obama, seen here with Beyonce at his swearing-in ceremony in January . Interest in Kim Jong Un's communist regime doesn't normally come close to those of pop stars and presidents. But a graph from Google Trends shows how the frequency with which users are searching for North Korea has spiked dramatically over the last two weeks. Its peak came on April 4 when it announced it would restart its plutonium nuclear plant having earlier released a 'strike plan' purporting to show places on the U.S. mainland it could hit with its missiles. At that point, searches were almost ten times more frequent than President Obama and Beyonce. According to The Washington Post, a poll by the Pew Research Centre estimates that 36 per cent of Americans are following the news on North Korea 'very closely', with 56 per cent saying the U.S. should take its warmongering 'very seriously'. Peak: Data from Google Trends shows how interest in North Korea has spiked dramatically over the last two weeks . Of those, around 47 per cent believe North Korea has the ability to launch a nuclear missile that can hit the United States. A Pentagon agency did nothing to calm those fears today after the accidental release of a secret report suggested Kim Jong Un may indeed be able to launch a nuclear-armed missile at its enemies. The Obama administration quickly sought to play down the threat and the consensus inside the U.S. government is that North Korea does not yet have a nuclear device that would fit longer-range missiles which conceivably could reach U.S. territories. It is not even clear whether it has the ability to place one on medium and short-range weapons, given the technological challenges in making a device small enough and robust enough to be blasted on a rocket. The Pew poll also found that 59 per cent think Kim Jong Un is willing to follow through on his threat to attack the West. However, nearly all North Korea analysts believe he has no such desire to do so, saying that he is simply seeking concessions from the West or attempting to consolidate his power.

While many were accompanied by positive headlines hailing the enduring legacy of the Conservative premier, The Citizen in South Africa summed up the fierce divisions of opinion she created both in life and death. The paper splashed 'hailed and despised' over a picture of Mrs Thatcher waving, along with the line: 'Fans praise Iron Lady, but her death leaves others cold'. In France, a former minister and presidential candidate whipped up a storm after suggesting Mrs Thatcher, who died of a stroke aged 87 yesterday, will go to hell.

Mr Melenchon, who stood to become president last year, had tweeted: 'Margaret Thatcher will find out in hell, exactly what she did to the miners.' It was a reference to Mrs Thatcher's hardline economic reforms in the 1980s which saw the closure of coal mines across the UK with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs amid violent protests by the unions. Marc Blondel, former secretary general of CGT-FO union, was similarly vitriolic, saying. 'She wanted to pacify the union movement, but in doing so undermined democracy in her country.'

The embarrassing blunder can be seen in the depiction of Joyce's stream of consciousness with the coin featuring a portrait of the author's face and a quotation - albeit with an extra word - flowing from the mind.

In early 1992, Mrs Thatcher moved to spacious new offices in a fine Georgian house in Chesham Place, Belgravia, where her combined sitting room and study was arranged to look very much like the working space she’d had at No. 10. She worked in a high-backed chair by the fireplace, looking at papers with the help of a huge magnifying glass — she wilfully refused to wear reading glasses — underlining, marking marginalia, gathering odds and ends together in files, and then forgetting where she had put them. The room was dominated by an extraordinary portrait of her by a Russian artist, which she liked because it made her look very thin and intellectual. Her staff hated it and referred to it as Nosferatu. Warmth: This picture with the Queen and the Queen Mother was proudly displayed in Mrs Thatcher's home . Dotted around were busts of Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill and her husband, Denis. A rather unnerving bronze impression of her own hands, sliced off at the wrists, perched on a ledge. Bowls, dishes and statues were frequently moved around as the fancy took her. She needed no help with this, being immensely strong in the arms. There was not a stuck window or jammed door she could not shift — and, being impatient, she would sometimes use this strength in disregard of her personal safety. She would go out onto the balcony at home to force open the French windows, presenting herself obligingly profiled for any sniper. In her office, her desk and cupboards were stuffed with pamphlets and photocopied articles and speeches. When in search of ideas, she would get down on her knees and rummage through them. A glass-fronted bookcase was full of her favourite volumes, selected for inspiration rather than continuous reading, which she rarely practised. She preferred to dip into books and extract whatever she found useful in them without worrying too much about what the author’s conclusions actually were. In her handbag, she always carried around a tiny volume of extracts from Churchill’s speeches and broadcasts. Many of her most heavily thumbed books were of poetry: Kipling (naturally) and Palgrave’s Golden Treasury. She was over-fond of quoting, not realising that what she herself had to say was more noteworthy. She became enthralled by a book of sayings from U.S. Presidents and was annoyed when Denis threw it out with the rubbish — by mistake, or so he claimed. She was not modest about her achievements, and the offices were packed with memorabilia of past glories and triumphs — Cabinet and G7 summit photographs, watercolours of Chequers and scenes from the Falklands campaign. Stately: Baroness Margaret Thatcher pictured in 1992 at the Conservative Party Conference . Yet the offices still had a distinctive femininity. Every week, a friend sent beautiful flowers whose perfume filled the air, adding to Mrs Thatcher’s own, for she wore a heavy scent, usually Chanel No. 5. At home in Chester Square, she displayed rows of snuffboxes, together with silver, china and photographs. She was particularly fond of one showing her with the Queen and the Queen Mother at Balmoral. She got on much better with the Queen than is frequently imagined, albeit with greater warmth in her last years. But she had greatest regard for the Queen Mother, who reciprocated it. On one wall of the sitting room was a painting by Nick Ridley — her former minister, and a talented artist — of Downing Street. A mixed bag of other paintings of different styles, some surprisingly risqué, adorned the entrance hall and bordered the staircase. In these surroundings, year by year after leaving office, she worked at an immense pace to further her ideas and to advance British interests overseas — no one was ever more effective at securing a contract for some British firm than Mrs Thatcher. Needless to say, she neither sought nor received any benefit from doing so.","She thrived on living in and amongst memorabilia of her past glories and triumphs, including G7 summit photographs and watercolours of Chequers .

A Canadian performer has become the first burlesque dancer to be awarded a green card based on her 'extraordinary ability' and is now making the most of it by touring the U.S. Last fall, Bettina May, who moved to New York from Victoria in 2010, was granted one of the 4,000 extraordinary ability EB-1A green cards approved in the country in 2012. Applicants - from artists, athletes, scientists, educators and entrepreneurs - must prove they are top in their field with reams of evidence, from media coverage, awards and a hefty salary. Stand out: Canadian burlesque performer Bettina May, pictured, was granted a green card based on her 'extraordinary ability' and now tours the U.S. with her show and pin-up model classes . A third of applications were rejected last year, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. For May, the process took around a year and a half, and required a six-inch-thick dossier to show that burlesque was an art form, and that she was unlike any other performer in the country. The file included newspaper clippings from across the country, a tape of her appearance on the 'Real Housewives', box office sales and letters of recommendation, NBC reported. 'I was a wreck, thinking at any minute . they're going to tell me you have to leave the country,' she said. 'It’s . so hard to live your life that way. What do I do if I get kicked out?' Professional: It took a year and a half and a six-inch-thick dossier to prove that she was the top of her field . But the good news finally came last fall after she had spent $10,000 in legal fees. 'I have never been so excited about a piece of plastic,' May told NBC. 'And it's actually green!' May studied political science and worked for the Canadian government before she found a burlesque troupe that was the beginning of her love affair. She decided . to leave Canada simply because there were more opportunities for her . work in the U.S. 'I love Canada and it's a wonderful . country and it's a great place to live but as an entertainer I really . need to be somewhere with a dense population,' she said. 'Every musical that has ever inspired me . in my career is all about going to New York and making it big on the . stage. I just wanted to be that girl.' Performer: She said she brings vintage glamor to the art form and channels 1940s stars such as Rita Hayworth . She will have to renew the green card after 10 years or she can apply for citizenship in five. Her attorney, Jan Brown, told the New York Daily News she believes May is the first burlesque dancer to qualify for the visa. 'We certainly had to go the distance to . convince USCIS that she qualified under their criteria,' he said. 'The . bottom line is she really is one of the best pin-up models and burlesque . artists.' May said she stands out as different because of her vintage take on burlesque; she is inspired by 1940s stars including Rita Hayworth and Betty Grable. A devoted vegan, she also designs costumes that look the part but do not use leather, fur or feathers. She also hosts pin-up model makeovers across the country. Here for good: She wanted to leave Canada as her opportunities as a performer were better in the U.S . Despite being at the top of her field, the fact that a burlesque dancer was given a green card may make it appear they are easy to get. This is simply not the case, said attorney Michael Wildes, who helped Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Australian golfer Greg Norman achieve theirs. 'We have seen over the years it's harder to get these cases approved,' said Wildes told NBC. 'We've seen the government go through [applications] with a surgical knife.' For May, all the paperwork was worth it. 'It's great that I'm able to make a living doing what I love doing and in the place that I want to do it,' she said.","Bettina May was granted one of the 4,000 'extraordinary ability' green cards approved in the country last year .

The activists who allegedly recorded a private conversation among members of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's re-election team are tied to a liberal political action committee whose co-founder was a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Jacob Conway, an executive committee member of the Jefferson County, Kentucky Democratic Party, told WFPL radio in Louisville that Progress Kentucky co-founders Shawn Reilly and Curtis Morrison bragged to him about how they recorded a February meeting of McConnell campaign staffers. That conversation featured a discussion of how actress Ashley Judd, then a potential challenger for McConnell's Senate seat, could be targeted for her past battles with mental illness that left her 'emotionally unbalanced' and stricken with 'suicidal tendencies.' Judd announced on March 27 that she would not run. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Actress Ashley Judd, shown here in the 1999 film Double Jeopardy, considered running for a US Senate seat in Kentucky, but was dogged by carpetbagger accusations since she lives in Tennessee . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is preparing for his sixth Senate election in 2014. He and a small group of his campaign staffers were secretly recorded during a Feb. 4 strategy session in their Kentucky campaign headquarters . On the tape, which swiftly made the rounds April 9, McConnell is heard suggesting a 'Whac-a-Mole' strategy against Judd. 'When anybody sticks their head up,' he said, 'do them out.' Reilly and Morrison were reportedly at McConnell's Kentucky campaign headquarters for its Feb. 2 grand opening, and remained in the building long enough to overhear the campaign team's strategy session from outside a closed door, and to decide to record it. The Daily Caller reported that Reilly was a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. It cited a Huffington Post story which noted that before he co-founded Progress Kentucky, Reilly 'was a member of the executive committee of the state Democratic Party.' 'Although Reilly appears to be a member of the Democratic Party establishment,' the Caller reported, 'media outlets are now propagating a version of the illegal bugging story in which Democratic officials claim to have been blindsided by a scandal foisted on them by an unaccountable outside group.' Curtis Morrison (R) is one of two Progress Kentucky co-founders accused of making the unauthorized recording and giving it to Mother Jones reporter David Corn. The other man, Shawn Reilly, claims he was a 'witness.' his lawyer blames Morrison for any alleged illegal activity . Conway, the county-level Democratic . Party executive who blew the whistle on Progress Kentucky's recording . exploit, told the Fox News Channel that Reilly and Morrison bragged to . him about what they had done. 'They mentioned that they were there. ... I don't know why they were at the grand opening of his campaign office, but they were there after the event had ended, and were in the hallway. And they overheard the conversation going on,' Conway told anchor Megyn Kelly. 'It was a very tasteless thing that the McConnell campaign did,' he added, 'but it was a private conversation nonetheless.' They decided the record it,' he added, and they told me about this.' Progress Kentucky's main purpose seems to be to oust McConnell from his perch at the top of the Senate's Republican pecking order. Politico reported in January that the group was approaching tea party-affiliated Republicans in an effort to persuade someone to challenge the five-term 71-year-old politician. A YouTube video published in December shows the group organizing a 'fiscal cliff caroling' event on the sidewalk in front of McConnell's home. Jacob Conway, a committee member of the Jefferson County, Kentucky Democratic Party, said during a radio interview that Reilly and Morrison bragged about making the tape . The group describes itself as 'a different kind of Super PAC: a grassroots movement that will use traditional media, new media, and direct action to hold Senator Mitch McConnell accountable for his failed record.' Reilly has taken the position that he was an innocent bystander, placing the blame squarely on Morrison. 'Shawn is completely innocent of any criminal wrongdoing,' Reilly attorney Annie O'Connell told Buzzfeed. 'He is a witness, not a suspect. He has fully cooperated with the United States Attorney's office for the Western district of Kentucky since the recording became public,' and has provided 'material assistance to the investigators.' That appears consistent with what Conway told WFPL he learned from the men he says made the tape. 'One of them held the elevator, the other one did the recording and they left,' Conway said. McConnell played jiu-jitsu with his liberal antagonists, turning negative publicity from the damaging recording into a positive fundraising windfall for his campaign . McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton said in a statement that 'WFPL’s reports that left-wing activists illegally recorded a private meeting inside our campaign headquarters are very disturbing.' Sen. McConnell himself called the apparent wiretapping incident 'Nixonian' in a successful rapid-response fundraising campaign, is 'very disturbing.' 'At this point, we understand that the FBI is immersed in an intensive criminal investigation,' he said. The FBI's Louisville office declined to make a comment. Mother Jones magazine, the non-profit liberal magazine that published the recording, may be in legal jeopardy - or in danger of losing its tax-exempt status - if it's determined that the tape was made illegally. It's a crime in Kentucky to record or publish the contents of a private conversation unless all its participants consent. And crossing state lines with such a recording, an FBI source told MailOnline on condition of anonymity, is a 'slam-dunk federal case.' Judd read the vote totals for Tennessee - not Kentucky - during the presidential nomination roll call vote for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2012 . Mother Jones is headquartered in California. David Corn, the reporter who broke the story, is based in Washington, D.C. On Thursday, Progress Kentucky Treasurer Douglas David confirmed to NBC News that he resigned from the group after the audio recording was made, but before his organization was named publicly in connection with it. 'I have resigned my position as treasurer and did not and do not condone any allegations of illegal activity that might have taken place,' he said.","One Progress Kentucky founder fingers another, claims he was a 'witness'

Maria Tallchief, one of America's first great prima ballerinas who gave life to such works as The Nutcracker and Firebird has died at 88 years old. Tallchief 's daughter, Elise Paschen, revealed today that her mother had passed away in Chicago on Thursday. Tallchief danced with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1942 to 1947, but her career was most associated with the New York City Ballet, where she worked from 1948 to 1965. Balanchine, the Russian-born dance genius, was not only the company's director; in 1946, he became Tallchief's husband for some years. She told Women's Wear Daily in 2003 that when she first worked with Balanchine she thought, ""'I am seeing music. This is it!' I was a musician myself, and I thought, 'I am in my place now.' I knew that that's the way I wanted to dance."" Tallchief was one of five Oklahoma natives of American Indian descent who rose to prominence in the ballet world from the 1940s through the 1960s. She retired in 1965, when she started teaching the next generation of dancers. ""My mother was a ballet legend, who was proud of her Osage heritage,"" Paschen said in a statement. ""Her dynamic presence lit up the room. I will miss her passion, commitment to her art and devotion to her family. She raised the bar high and strove for excellence in everything she did.""

She was the Sugar Plum Fairy in his original production of ""The Nutcracker"" in 1954. In the 1970s, Tallchief served as artistic director of the Lyric Opera Ballet in Chicago. She later founded and was artistic director of the Chicago City Ballet. In 1996, Tallchief became one of five artists to receive the Kennedy Center Honors for their lifelong contributions to American culture. Tallchief was born Elizabeth Marie Tall Chief in 1925, on a reservation in Fairfax, Oklahoma, a small town about 60 miles northwest of Tulsa. Visiting teachers gave her lessons, and her mother later moved the family to Los Angeles so that she and her sister could receive proper training.

Mubarak, wearing gold aviator sunglasses was wheeled into a Cairo courtroom today for his retrial for alleged complicity in the killing of demonstrators during the 2011 revolt. Relatives of the dead protesters chanted: 'The people demand the execution of Mubarak!' as Judge Mostafa Hassan announced his decision, saying he felt 'unease' at reviewing the case. Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak waved from his spot in court during his retrial hearing today . Mubarak was seen being loaded into an ambulance on his way to a Cairo court today . The former Egyptian president was taken from Maadi Military Hospital to court via helicopter today . Hassan previously acquitted 25 top . former Mubarak era officials on charges of orchestrating violence when . pro-democracy activists were attacked by thugs riding on camels in . Cairo's central Tahrir Square during the 18-day revolt. 'We ask for the harshest possible . sentence on Mubarak due to the cruel crimes he committed against the . protesters, but we are happy with the judge's decision to withdraw as we . had worries about him given his ruling (on) the camel attack case,' said Mohamed Abdel Wahab, a lawyer for the victims. Mubarak, 84, who ruled Egypt for . almost 30 years before being toppled by 18 days of Arab Spring . pro-democracy unrest, waved and smiled to supporters from the . defendants' cage in the courtroom before the brief hearing began. He was flown by helicopter from a . military hospital where he has been detained to the police academy used . as a courthouse, and wheeled from an ambulance into the building lying . on a hospital trolley wearing a white tracksuit. His two sons Alaa and Gamal and his . former interior minister Habib el-Adly, currently held in prison for . separate cases, were also in the courtroom cage. Mubarak had not been seen in public since his initial conviction in June 2012. Unconfirmed reports have emerged several times in the past year suggesting that he was on the brink of death. Mubarak's retrial was granted by an appeals court that overturned his life sentence in January, citing shoddy procedures. He has remained in custody since, spending some time in a prison hospital before being transferred to a military one. Mubarak was taken to court in Cairo from the Maadi Military Hospital . A helicopter ambulance flew 84-year-old Mubarak to court from the military hospital where he is being treated . If convicted again, the life sentence passed against Mubarak and el-Adly would be upheld. They could also have their sentence reduced or even be acquitted. It is considered unlikely that they would draw a heavier sentence, like the death penalty, . Also standing trial are six police generals. Five face the same charges as Mubarak while the sixth is accused of gross negligence. All six were acquitted in the first trial, but are being tried again. The presiding judge of that first trial said the prosecution's case lacked concrete evidence and failed to prove the protesters were killed by the police, indirectly giving credence to the testimony of top Mubarak-era officials that 'foreigners' were behind the slayings between January 25 and February 1, 2011.","Judge Mostafa Hassan cites 'unease' at reviewing the case .

Despite long-standing international criticism of the camps, many Chinese are largely oblivious to them because many of those who are locked up are poor and on the fringes of society and their cases are not publicised. Tang gained wide attention following reports in state media, with the case of a mother demanding justice for her daughter resonating with the public. State media and microbloggers seized on her case to question the labour-camp system, saying it violated human rights and the rule of law. A group of lawyers wrote to the central government seeking the repeal of the system.","Tang Hui was sentenced to 18 months in a labour camp last August .

"By . Nina Golgowski . UPDATED: . 14:14 EST, 12 April 2013 . Jurors on Thursday watched video capturing the horrific moment a mother was gunned down in broad daylight while picking up her 11-year-old daughter outside a New York City school. Behind her another mother was seen shot in her arm before staggering against a wall while trying to hide her own son from the alleged gang members' stray gunfire from a nearby rooftop. This frightening surveillance video was presented at the Brooklyn Supreme Court on Thursday during the trial of two men accused in killing Zurana Horton, 34, a mother of 12, in 2011 and wounding two others, including an 11-year-old girl. Attack: This surveillance video shows the moment just before a gunman fired from a Brooklyn rooftop striking three people, Zurana Horton, seen standing left in a black jacket and pants, fatally . Mistake: Children are seen toppled on the sidewalk outside a Brooklyn school, Mrs Horton among them against a wall, after alleged gang members fired several shots intended for another gang . Tragic aftermath: Mrs Horton is seen lying in a pool of blood on the sidewalk as other victims and witnesses scramble in terror . Prosecutors say Andrew Lopez, 20, an alleged 8 Block gang member fired the shots meant for rival gang members from the Howard Projects while his brother Jonathan Carrasquillo, 24, gave the orders. 'When me and my son were on the floor, I noticed Mrs Horton fall down. I honestly thought she was shot in the head. There was blood,' said Unique Armstead, who was shot along with an 11-year-old girl nearby according to the New York post. Mrs Armstead says that just before the shots were fired she passed a group of young men arguing on the street about a gun. Her testimony matched prosecutors' claims. Feeling uneasy, she says 'I speed-walked to my son, and I held him. I was scared. I was trying to get out of harm's way.' Senseless death: Mrs Horton, a mother of 12 from Brooklyn, is seen in photos taken a few years before she was tragically killed while innocently picking up her daughter from school in 2011 . Family: Mrs Horton is seen among several of her children, left, as well as her mother . She took her son into a nearby store to wait it out. When the fight appeared to die down, she says she slipped back onto the street with her son by her side when a stray bullet shot straight into her arm. She next saw Horton fall down dead. Mrs Horton is seen sprawled out on the sidewalk beside a pool of blood on the surveillance video. - Unique Armstead testified of final moments before shots rang out . Witnesses are seen cowering in fear around her. 'At the time, I thought it was a brick, but it was a bullet,' Mrs Armstead said of her injury. Lopez, who was 18 at the time of the shooting, confessed to being the rooftop sniper according to initial reports by the New York Daily News. The gunman said the shooting near Public School 298 in Brownsville had stemmed from a turf war between two Brooklyn gangs. Lopez told police that 'he did not mean to shoot the ladies,' the source said. A . second witness had expected to testify in the shooting on Thursday as . well but after threatened with death by the brother of the alleged . gunman, their testimony has been delayed until Monday. 'The man is an emotional wreck,' Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Vincent Del Giudice said, according to the Post. Lopez has been linked to a Brooklyn gang . known as '8 Block,' who police say are engaged in a turf battle with . the neighboring Young Guns gang. Scene: The gunfire erupted from this Brooklyn apartment where the 8 block gang are said to have originated from and taken their name . Selfless: Mrs Horton shielded her daughter as the gunfire rang out around her along the sidewalk . More victims: In addition to Mrs Horton's shooting, another mother was shot in her arm as well as an 11-year-old girl . NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said: . 'We're certainly pleased with the fact that the investigation has . identified Mr. Lopez and he's made statements and apparently made a full . confession,' the Daily News reported. Lopez told police he was aiming for rival gang members when a stray bullet hit the mother of 13 who was collecting her children from school. Horton was planning to marry her boyfriend on Valentine's Day in 2012. Also arrested were Lopez' half-brother, 17-year-old Kristian, and Carrasquillo. All three live in a fifth-floor apartment inside 1800 Pitkin Ave., the same building from where the gunman opened fire, police said. That apartment building is said to be where 8 Block got their name, the Post reported in 2011. Carrasquillo was charged with murder, and Kristian Lopez was arrested for possession of a baseball bat, police said. Andrew Lopez had a previous arrest for walking down Pitkin Ave. brandishing a loaded gun three years ago, sources told the Daily News. The shooting frenzy in which at least 12 shots were fired began just 13 minutes after school finished. Cheanne McKnight, 11, is recovering from a graze wound to her cheek, while a 31-year-old Brooklyn mom was shot in the arm. Police recovered 12 9-mm shell casings on the roof of the Pitkin Avenue apartment and the sidewalk. A new generation of gangs have taken over the streets of New York City, with the 8 Block gang being one of more than 300 of them on the NYPD's radar. Traditional gangs: Members of the Crips and Bloods gangs, known as more traditional gangs, are seen here during a 2006 rally in New York . Called 'Young Guns' due to gang members' typical young age - some as young as 10 - these gangs divert from the . ways of traditional gangs, while found far more violent and . unpredictable, according to authorities. The result of these non-traditional . gangs has turned many innocent bystanders into victims of cross fire . after firearms are placed in the hands of individuals who have little . experience or training. There has also been a spike in sex-trafficking and prostitution in the last year, Lou Savelli, a leading consultant who founded the NYPD’s gang unit, tells the New York Post. The Young Gun members' attacks are also said to be far more impulsive and emotionally driven, opposed to planned-out attacks so as to escape attention by the police and media. 'The 14-year-olds, the 15-year-olds, they are the worst,' Steve Bosco, 36, who drives a Wonder Bread truck down Brooklyn's Myrtle Avenue told the New York Times. 'Maybe they feel they have something to prove. The feeling for us is that they very well could shoot you if you don't give them the money, shoot you if you don't give them enough, shoot you if they have got everything they wanted.' - Brooklyn driver who describes living in fear of young, reckless gang members . The more traditional gangs, like the Bloods, Crips and Latin Kings, have far more strict rules and standards their members must abide by, according to the Post. Their members are selected internally and evaluated. They also go through initiation rites and written rules of conduct that includes colors and language usage. Andrew Lopez was 18 when police say he fired off the shot that killed Kurana Horton outside a Brooklyn school in Brownsville, an area that has the highest concentration of public housing in the nation. The shots are said to have come from 1800 Pitkin Ave., an apartment building where the 8 Block gang members are said to have originated from after its establishment by Jonathan Carrasquillo's older brother Ismael, who is serving 20 years for murder. Carrasquillo is the 24-year-old accused of ordering Lopez' shots from on top the apartment building. When members of the 8 Block gang saw rival members from the Howard Projects on Pitkin Ave., they got into position to fire, according to authorities. Though Lopez allegedly told police he didn't mean to hit those other people on the street, his spray of reckless gunfire struck three people, one fatally.","Zurana Horton, 34, a mother of 12, was fatally shot in 2011 while picking up her daughter, 11, from school .

An enormous 'power ship' is helping to keep the lights on in Lebanon as the country's energy supply struggles to meet growing demand. The Turkish-owned ship, named the Fatmagül Sultan, arrived off the coast of Beirut and was hooked up to the country's national grid earlier this year, as part of an innovative project aimed at tackling power shortages in developing countries. With its 11 towering chimneys, the floating power station is credited with providing an extra two hours of electricity per day to Lebanon, where an influx of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees over the past two years has put the energy supply under further strain. The ship is moored off Beirut under a . $370m deal between the Lebanese government and Turkish energy firm . Karadeniz Holding, according to a report in the Guardian. It . is to be followed by a second Turkish power ship set to arrive off . Beirut in June, which will see the extra 188MW of electricity per day . already provided by the Fatmagül Sultan boosted to 270MW daily. 'The . arrival of the ships will ease the summer brunt when the power demand . will reach 3,000MW,' said Kamal Hayek, general manager of Électricité du Liban.

Congress' most serious gun-control effort in years passed the first step towards legalization on Thursday as the Senate pushed past conservatives' attempted blockade under the teary gaze of families of victims of December's Connecticut school shootings. The bipartisan 68-31 vote rebuffed an effort to keep debate from even starting, giving an early victory - and perhaps political momentum - to President Barack Obama and his gun control allies. Four months after 20 first-graders and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown were killed, relatives watching the vote from a gallery overlooking the Senate floor dabbed at tears and clasped hands, some seeming to pray. Scroll down for video . In their honor: Erica Lafferty, the daughter of Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, and Jillian Soto, the sister of slain teacher Victoria Soto, spoke alongside senators after the new bill passed Congress . Emotional: Jillian Soto was surrounded by other parents and family members who lost relatives in the December 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, many of whom have been pushing for stricter gun laws ever since . Emotional: Many of the Newtown relatives, including Jillian Soto, were present as they have pushed legislators to take action, specifically requiring background checks for all gun sales which was approved today . Even so, few supporters of the legislation are confident of victory. Several weeks of emotional, unpredictable Senate debate lie ahead, and a mix of gun-rights amendments, opposition from the National Rifle Association and skepticism from House Republican leaders leave big questions about what will emerge from Congress. Today the bill passed through the Senate with bi-partisan support. It still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives in Congress before becoming law, but if it is passed it will: . Foes of the proposed new restrictions say they would penalize law-abiding citizens and do nothing to curb gun violence. 'The hard work starts now,' said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Democrat who brought the legislation to the floor for debate. Still, in a Congress marked by a notable lack of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, Thursday's vote was one of several displays of unusual rapport across party lines. Hoping to bring pressure on Congress to act on gun control, supporters of new restrictions have been demonstrating in Washington. They have erected a mock graveyard with thousands of crosses on the National Mall, symbolizing victims of gun violence. Starting in: Volunteer Martin Witchger begins putting some of the crosses in the lawn of the National Mall early Thursday morning hours before the background check bill passed its first hurdle in Congress . Big numbers: All told, there were 3,300 markers on the Mall as that is the number of people affected by gun violence in the U.S. since December 14, the date of the Newtown shooting . Making an impact: Gun control advocates set up a display of crosses and Stars of David on the National Mall as a mock cemetery to show how many people lose their lives to guns . The Senate's firearms bill would subject . nearly all gun buyers to background checks, add muscle to federal laws by . barring illicit firearm sales and provide slightly more money for school . safety measures. Excluded and facing near-certain defeat in upcoming votes were proposals to ban military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines - factors in the Newtown killings some other recent mass shootings. But keeping those provisions out of the current legislation did not mollify critics. Opponents said the remaining proposals were unwarranted intrusions on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, would be ignored by criminals and would do little to prevent future Newtowns. Obama's plans have received scant support from Republicans and many moderate Democrats, with many saying they prefer improvements in dealing with the mentally ill and stronger enforcement of existing laws. Hoping for momentum: Lori Haas, a mother who lost a relative to gun violence, is one of the many people who have been pushing for attention to be paid to the Sandy Hook relatives proposals . 'I'm not interested in a symbolic gesture which would offer the families of the Sandy Hook shootings no real solutions that they seek,' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's second-leading Republican. Congress hasn't approved major gun restrictions since enacting an assault weapons ban 19 years ago, a prohibition that lawmakers let lapse after a decade. Some potential amendments could broaden gun rights and weaken supporters' backing for the overall bill. One proposal is by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Mark Begich who say it would improve how the federal background check system blocks weapons from going to people with certain mental problems, though critics say it would make it harder in some cases to do so. Another possible amendment would require states to recognize permits for carrying concealed weapons issued by other states. In Thursday's vote, 50 Democrats and 2 Democratic-leaning independents were joined by 16 Republicans in voting to begin debate on the legislation. Support: Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer from New York has been one of the strongest advocates for pushing through the more strict gun control laws . Proximity: New York's Schumer was joined alongside Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal when he addressed the press and the Newtown relatives . Twenty-nine Republicans and two Democrats facing re-election next year in GOP-leaning states voted 'no' - Alaska's Begich and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. After the roll call, Obama spoke by phone with some Newtown families and said he would 'keep fighting for the votes they deserve,' said White House spokesman Jay Carney. The Senate plans to debate an amendment Tuesday expanding background checks less broadly than the overall legislation would. Broadening the system to cover more transactions is the heart of the current effort on guns. That amendment, a compromise between Republican Senator Patrick Toomey and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin would subject buyers in commercial settings like gun shows and the Internet to the checks but exempt non-commercial transactions like sales between friends and relatives. Reaching out: Democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia met with Newtown in his office. He was one of the leaders on the background check bill that was approved in Congress today . That accord, unveiled Wednesday, was designed to build bipartisan support for the legislation and seemed likely to do so. Toomey and Manchin are among the most conservative members of their parties and are both gun owners with NRA ratings of A, which is the highest that the gun lobbyist awards. Toomey said Thursday he believes supporters of his compromise with Manchin would be able to beat back any filibuster attempt. 'Beyond that, I just don't know yet,' he said on 'CBS This Morning.' Gun-control . groups have embraced the Manchin-Toomey compromise with varying degrees . of enthusiasm, and they continued to applaud it on Thursday - while . also expressing concerns about some provisions. Possible roadblock: Skepticism from House Republican leaders like House Speaker John Boehner leave big questions about what will emerge from Congress . Besides the exemption for private sales, gun control advocates expressed displeasure with language letting gun dealers sell handguns to out-of-state customers, exempting some holders of permits for concealed weapons from background checks and shielding individuals who sell guns from some negligence lawsuits. 'We are optimistic that this bill will make a dramatic difference in reducing gun violence,' said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The NRA said it opposed the Manchin-Toomey compromise and warned senators that it would count votes on provisions it opposes in its evaluation of candidates that it provides its members, who the organization says number nearly 5 million.","Gun control bill passes in Senate with bipartisan support .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:04 EST, 13 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:36 EST, 13 April 2013 . Grinning graffiti artist Krisitan Holmes, from Sidcup, Kent, is in jail after a seven-year spree of vandalising trains and stations . A graffiti artist who vandalised trains and stations, including the world famous Bluebell steam railway, during a seven-year spree has been put behind bars. Kristian Holmes, 32, caused £250,000 of damage by scrawling his 'VAMP' tag to trains, walls, and bridges across London and the southeast between 2003 and 2010. The accounts worker kept an A-Z street guide marked with the locations he had vandalised and his distinctive tag was even found scrawled on a wall in Ibiza. Holmes was a leading member of the PS crew which forced trains out of services by daubing tags, in-jokes and crude caricatures on carriages at night-time. He had links to other graffiti vandals including Matthew Mandell, who was just 4ft 3in and used a stepladder to tag trains across London, Hertfordshire and Kent. Holmes began his 'tedious and depressing' crime spree when he attacked a 63-year-old carriage on the Bluebell Railway - the steam-powered heritage line run by volunteers in Sussex. He was convicted by a jury of 39 charges of criminal damage after a five week retrial at Blackfriars Crown Court. Holmes was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice after he made a video showing a mixed race man painting the VAMP tag in a bid to scupper an investigation into the damage. Judge Deva Pillay remanded him in custody ahead of sentence on May 17. The first jury had failed to reach verdicts after a six-week trial last July. Prosecutor James Murray-Smith had said there was a 'welter of circumstantial evidence' linking Holmes to the damage. 'Mr Holmes is a prolific graffiti vandal,' he said. 'We are not talking here about witty imaginative images such as those I expect you are familiar with by Banksy. 'What you make of the graffiti in this case is a matter for you, but I would suggest what you are dealing with is simple damage. 'It is damage which to the vast majority of the public is tedious and depressing.' Of the Bluebell Railway, he said: 'It is not owned by a large wealth corporation, it is run by volunteers for their pleasure. 'If one of the trains gets damaged, they either have to get together the money to pay for repairs, or do the work themselves.' Holmes was first caught writing his tag on a wall at Cafe 1001, in Brick Lane, east London, on July 26, 2009. Scroll down for video . Holmes began his spree in 2003, targeting the world-famous Bluebell steam railway in Sussex . He was arrested but claimed he was bending down to look at the graffiti at time. Holmes was caught with three cans of spray paint in his bag, but was released without charge. Mr Murray-Smith said British Transport Police officers found a 'bomber bag' - the vandal's term for a rucksack of graffiti equipment - when they aided Holmes' home in Kirkland Close, Sidcup, Kent. He originally claimed to live in Ellison Road, Sidcup, but when officers raided his real home they found 22 spray can nozzles, Network Rail high visibility jackets and trousers, cameras, and right-hand gloves 'splattered with paint'. They also found an A-Z atlas with annotations marking places where the VAMP tag had been sprayed, or potential pitfalls to accessing railway lines, the court heard. Police raided Holmes' employer, RI Building Services in Bromley, and his previous employer Versatile Kent in Orpington when they arrested him, and seized his computers. When asked in interview about MySpace pages featuring the VAMP tag, he claimed it was just a 'freaky coincidence.' Holmes had also created a series of YouTube videos with Pang to throw detectives off the scent. 'There was a conspiracy as posting the videos on YouTube was an attempt to mislead police into thinking the author of the tag was mixed race person, not a white person,' Mr Murray-Smith said. But the jury saw images taken from Holmes' computers which show a white hand making the tag. Mr Murray-Smith said Holmes was an associate of other prolific graffiti vandals like Mandell, 29, and they kept in touch through MySpace and Facebook. Mandell, who had Holmes' number stored in his phone under the name 'Kris Vam', was jailed for nine months and given a five year ASBO for criminal damage in 2010. Holmes, of Kirkland Close, Sidcup, Kent was convicted of 39 counts of criminal damage - 23 attacks on Southeastern Railway trains, eight on Network Rail walls or bridges, two on National Express East Anglia trains and two on East Kent Railway Trust carriages, as well as the scrawls at Cafe 1001, the Bluebell Railway, and on a Barclays Bank wall. He was also convicted of perverting the course of justice.","Kristian Holmes, from Sidcup, Kent, went on seven-year spree .

If they feel a  Section Five offence is taking place, – that is, there is a distress, harassment or alarm – then they will do something about it. ‘London is an international city and if people want to come and protest lawfully then they have the right to. ‘It will depend on what they want to do. Primarily this is a funeral. If it was a day of protest if would have a different context. We have to balance it on the safety of members of the public. ‘We have been messaging out repeatedly for people to get in touch with us if they wish to protest. Some of them have and some have not. We cannot force people to do what they don’t want to.’ Former Government spokesman Sir Bernard Ingham (pictured in July 2003, at the chapel in the Royal Hospital in Chelsea, west London, for the funeral of Sir Denis Thatcher) said the force was 'conniving at a display of bad taste' Sir Bernard said of Ms Jones’s remarks: ‘The police are conniving at a display of bad taste, the plain fact is that we know exactly what these Left and anarchist groups do – they break convention and they enjoy doing it. ‘I’m absolutely certain there will be people who take great offence and are deeply upset by these protests because they don’t think it is the way to behave.’ A Cabinet Minister who did not wish to be named added: ‘These comments are most unfortunate. It is the job of the police to ensure that people behave in an appropriate way at a funeral such as this.’ Lady Thatcher’s former spokesman Lord Bell said: ‘Surely, the role of the police is to uphold respect for the law.’ Brian Paddick, a former Deputy Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard, added: ‘It’s an unfortunate choice of words. ‘I think it is unwise to say that. I understand the conciliatory approach and about upholding  people’s legal right to protest, but in these circumstances that right to protest should be out of sight and out of hearing of the funeral procession route.’ Anarchist Ian Bone said he had been approached by the police’s ‘protest facilitation unit’ and asked if he wished to hold a protest on Wednesday. Bone, who last night staged a performance in Trafalgar Square in which he cut down an effigy of Margaret Thatcher and played football with its head, said: ‘Scotland Yard got in touch to ask me if I wanted help organising a protest against the funeral. ‘I suppose I must be on a list of people to contact. I don’t plan on organising anything but if I did I certainly wouldn’t have informed them first.’ Several protests are planned for the funeral, including a fancy dress party outside the cathedral and a colliery brass band that intends to perform outside the cathedral. Dominic Francis, a student at Ruskin College, Oxford, has organised a demonstration for protesters to turn their back on the cortege as it passes. The 25-year-old said: ‘I support that her mourners should be allowed to grieve in peace. But when they decided to hold a State-funded, large ceremony like that, they open themselves up to public criticism.’","Sir Bernard Ingham said force was 'conniving at a display of bad taste'

Death rates at a children's heart unit in Leeds did not hit the threshold to trigger an NHS safety alert, it has been revealed. But two other centres, Alder Hey Children's . Hospital in Liverpool . and Evelina Children's Hospital in central London, also came close to the limit, according to the figures, . which cover the years 2009 to 2012. Surgery at Leeds General Infirmary's child cardiac unit was halted at the end of last month after NHS England said it had 'serious concerns' that data showed the unit had a death rate double that of other centres. It resumed again on Wednesday. Mortality rates for all children's heart surgery centres in England have been released following the temporary suspension of operations in Leeds . Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool also came close to the threshold that would trigger an NHS safety alert . NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh has said he could not 'sit on' data about high death rates without doing something about it and insisted the closure was not a 'knee-jerk reaction'. Data released by NHS England shows that none of the country's ten centres breached thresholds for child heart surgery deaths, but Leeds General Infirmary came 'very close' to the alert threshold. The analysis was compiled by the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, based at University College London, which oversees NHS mortality data. Analysis accompanying the figures said: 'These findings do not indicate a ""safety"" problem in any centre. 'However, centres with three-year outcomes approaching the alert threshold may deserve additional scrutiny and monitoring of current performance. 'By definition, around half of all units will have more deaths than ""expected"". 'It is therefore inappropriate to label centres as ""blameworthy"" for these deaths, as the analysis does not show a significantly increased mortality rate.' Professor Roger Boyle said he would not allow his daughter to be operated on in Leeds . A spokesman for Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are pleased to learn that all children's heart units in England, including Alder Hey, are safe. 'Alder Hey undertakes rigorous scrutiny of all our outcomes for this service, including an independent review of any deaths that sadly occur, in order to ensure that we have the safest, highest quality service for some of the most vulnerable infants and children in the country.' Yesterday, a senior National Health Service executive declared he would not want his daughter treated at the crisis-hit child heart unit in Leeds. Professor Sir Roger Boyle spoke out only days after the centre reopened after it was shut at short notice because of data he leaked on its comparative death rates. Sir Roger, who now oversees NHS death rate data but was national director for heart disease until 2011, told Radio 4 that care at Leeds was ‘on the edge of acceptability’. The father of a ten-year-old daughter, Amy, and three grown-up sons, he said: ‘I tell you that I have a young daughter, I would go somewhere else. I would go to Newcastle.’ His comments will alarm parents and enrage supporters of the unit at Leeds General Infirmary. They want him to be sacked, accusing him of ‘conducting a cynical vendetta’. Paediatric heart surgery at Leeds was suspended at the end of last month after data leaked by Sir Roger appeared to show death rates running at twice the national average. Surgeons at other units also raised concerns and parents told of children who were lucky to be alive. But others claimed the closure was politically motivated as it came just 24 hours after the High Court quashed plans to close the centre as part of measures to streamline children’s heart services. Sir Bruce said he now 'disagreed' with Sir Roger. ‘Having reviewed the unit, having reviewed the data, the performance in Leeds is in keeping with good national standards and I would be very happy to have my child operated upon in Leeds.'","Leeds, Alder Hey in Liverpool and Evelina in London came close to limit .

Yet, as these pictures show, not everything in Germany always goes to plan. With padlocks on gates, and workmen walking across terminals which are supposed to be packed with travellers, Berlin's new airport is becoming a source of national embarrassment. Red-faced: Willy Brandt International Airport was supposed to open in late 2011. Instead, it is still closed and is fast becoming a source of national embarrassment . Empty: Two workmen walk to the main terminal of the new airport. It should instead be bustling with thousands of passengers . Willy Brandt International Airport, named after Germany's famed Cold War leader, was supposed to have been up and running in late 2011. It was to be a sign of Berlin's transformation from Cold War confrontation line to world class capital of Europe's economic powerhouse. Instead it has become a symbol of how, even for this technological titan, things can go horribly wrong. After four publicly announced delays, officials acknowledged the airport won't be ready by the latest target of October 2013. To spare themselves further embarrassment, officials have refused to set a new opening date. The saga of Berlin's new airport has turned into a national joke and a source of humiliation for a people renowned for being on time. Yet it is just the highest profile in a string of big-ticket projects — including a concert hall in Hamburg, railway tunnels in Munich and Leipzig, a subway line in Cologne and a Stuttgart underground train station — that have been plagued by huge cost overruns and delays. The airport fiasco presents a staggering picture of incompetence. Problems: After four publicly announced delays, officials have admitted the airport won't be ready by the latest target of October 2013 . Embarrassing: A passenger bridge stands on the empty airfield of the new airport. The saga of Berlin's new airport has turned into a national joke and a source of humiliation . German media have tracked down a list of tens of thousands of technical problems. Among them: Officials can't even figure out how to turn the lights off. Thousands of light bulbs illuminate the gigantic main terminal and unused parking lots around the clock, a massive energy and cost drain that appears to be the result of a computer system that's so sophisticated it's almost impossible to operate. Every day, an empty commuter train rolls to the unfinished airport over a five-mile long stretch to keep the newly-laid tracks from getting rusty, another example of gross inefficiency. Meanwhile, hundreds of freshly planted trees had to be chopped down because a company delivered the wrong type of linden trees; several escalators need to be rebuilt because they were too short; and dozen of tiles were already broken before a single airport passenger ever stepped on them. The airport itself points to problems with the fire safety system as the immediate cause of the delays: The fire safety system incorporates some 75,000 sprinklers, but computer programming glitches mean it's not clear whether all of these sprinklers would spray enough water during a fire. And the system's underground vent system, designed to suck away smoke, isn't working. Here, again, technology's getting in the way: It's so advanced that technicians can't figure out what's wrong with it. Closed: To spare themselves further embarrassment, officials have refused to set a new opening date for the airport . Worrying: The airport is just the highest profile in a string of big-named projects that have been plagued by huge cost overruns and delays . Critics say that the difficulties with handling today's complex technology have been compounded by hasty, negligent work due to the intense time pressures. Underlying these problems appears to be a culture of political dishonesty. 'Many politicians want prestigious large-scale projects to be inseparably connected with their names,' said Sebastian Panknin, a financial expert with the Taxpayer's Association Germany. 'To get these expensive projects started, they artificially calculate down the real costs to get permission from parliament or other committees in charge.' In addition to that, politicians at the city, state and federal levels then often come with extra demands once construction is underway, which leads to expensive modifications. In the case of the Berlin airport, said Pankin, there were about 300 ad hoc change requests by politicians which created an explosion of costs and several delays, among them a last-minute wish to expand the terminal to include a shopping mall. 'The airport is a classic example of the incompetence of our politicians,' said Sven Fandrich, a 28-year-old Berliner who works for an insurance company. 'We've seen this happen with many big infrastructure projects in Germany. Nobody feels responsible. The politicians are more concerned about winning the next elections than devoting their service to the people.' Hamburg's concert hall was to have opened by 2010. Instead it's nowhere near complete and costs have more than doubled to 575 million euros. It's now due to open in 2016. Construction on Cologne's North-South subway line began in 2004. After cost overruns and a collapse that killed two people in 2009, officials say the entire line may not be open until 2019. Costs have soared from 780 million to 1.08 billion euros. In Leipzig, the city tunnel for commuter trains was expected to open in 2009. Construction is still not finished, and costs have jumped from 572 million to 960 million euros. Of all the bungled projects, the Berlin airport is the biggest embarrassment. The initial plan foresaw building a stately airport that would be financed by private investors and replace the city's two Cold War airports — Tegel in former West Berlin and Schoenefeld in what was the Communist east. After a series of disputes with private investors, the city, state and federal governments eventually took over the airport project. In 2006, costs were estimated at 2 billion euros, but after four delays, the figure spiked to 4.4 billion euros. Companies like Air Berlin, Germany's second biggest carrier, have been severely affected by the delays and are suing for lost revenues. Small businesses like coffee shops, restaurants, retail stores or bus operators - who had already hired staff and invested in new stores at the airport - are facing bankruptcy. Twitter users asked the mayor to 'please open this gate,' playing off President Ronald Reagan's famous 1987 appeal to Moscow to 'tear down' the Berlin Wall. And by the time the airport finally opens, it may face a new headache. Some aviation experts are warning that by its inauguration date, the airport will already be too small to handle the rising number of passengers. The nearly 3.9 million-square-foot (360,000 square meter) airport complex was designed to handle 27 million passengers. But the existing two city airports handled 25 million passengers last year - and the city keeps attracting more visitors every year. 'The airport is too expensive, too small and too much behind time,' said aviation expert Dieter Faulenbach da Costa, who recently caused a stir when he proposed that the airport ought to be torn down. In an effort to salvage the mess, Hartmut Mehdorn, the hard-nosed former boss of the German railway system with a reputation for turning around failing corporations, was named chief executive of the airport in early March. 'The whole world says: it's not possible at all,' Mehdorn said when he took over. 'I say: It should be possible. 'I just don't know how yet.'","Willy Brandt International Airport was supposed to open in late 2011 .

Doctor Andrew Wakefield, who was struck off over linking MMR with autism, said the government protected the MMR vaccine over children's health . The Government today dismissed claims by a doctor who sparked a global scare about the MMR vaccine that officials were responsible for the outbreak of measles in south Wales. Dr Andrew Wakefield, who was struck off over the MMR controversy, said officials had appeared to be more concerned about protecting the MMR programme than they were about protecting children. He wrote on a website that in 1998, following an analysis of studies of the safety of the MMR vaccine, which covers measles, mumps and rubella, he recommended the use of single measles vaccine in preference to MMR. ‘This remains my position.’ While MMR vaccination uptake fell from February 1998, there was a reciprocal increase in the uptake of the single vaccines, he said. ‘Vaccination clinics administered many thousands of doses of measles vaccine and children were 'protected'. ‘Six months later, in September 1998, the British Government withdrew the importation licence for the single vaccines, effectively blocking this option for parents. ‘Measles cases in the UK rose when the government withdrew the importation licence for the single measles vaccine leaving concerned parents with no choice.’ He added: ‘The government's concern appeared to be to protect the MMR programme over and above the protection of children.’ He also said two MMR vaccine brands had to be withdrawn for safety reasons. These had been approved despite warnings of the dangers. ‘These government officials put price before children's health and have been seeking to cover up this shameful fact ever since.’ Injection: Kieran Elford, aged 13, is given an MMR injection following the epidemic . Patient: Oliver Corteen, aged 11 months, is held in his father's arms as they queue . A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Dr Andrew Wakefield's claims are completely incorrect. Immunisation advice from the department has always kept the interests of patients paramount. 'Measles is a highly infectious and harmful disease. If your child has not had two doses of MMR, whatever their age, we urge you to contact your GP surgery and make an appointment.’ Almost 700 people have become infected in the Swansea area. It was announced on Thursday that another 73 cases had been reported - bringing the total number infected there to 693. Public Health Wales (PHW) has been urging parents of unvaccinated children across Wales to act immediately to ensure they are protected against the potentially fatal disease. Further drop-in vaccination clinics were taking place in South Wales today to in a bid to immunise the 6,000 children remain unvaccinated in the Swansea area alone. Determined: Long queues have formed outside several south Wales hospitals offering MMR jabs to halt the Swansea measles epidemic . Injection queue: Parents queue with their children in Swansea for the MMR jab after an outbreak of measles in South Wales. After 19 new cases were diagnosed in Middlesborough, people in the North East are also being urged to get the injection . Hospitals in Cardiff, Vale of Glamorgan, Newport, Hengoed, Swansea, Bridgend and Port Talbot areas were among the health centres to open vaccination clinics. More than 1,000 MMR jabs have been given today at the Singleton, Morriston, Neath Port Talbot and Princess of Wales Hospitals. Dr Sara Hayes, director of public health at Abertawe Bro Morgannwg . University Health Board, said: ‘We are very pleased with the number of . people who have attended this morning. ‘I can't stress enough how important it is for you to have your MMR . vaccination. Our clinics are open until 4pm today so please come and see . us.’ Last weekend more than 1,000 queued up for the MMR vaccination at clinics held across South Wales. Although the outbreak is centred on Swansea, cases have continued to be reported across the principality. Most are in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health region, which also includes Neath, Port Talbot and Bridgend. Vaccination: Lauren Durbin, aged 10 months, is given an MMR injection by Sister Sian Owen . The number of confirmed cases of measles (pictured left) in the Swansea epidemic has risen to 693, Public Health Wales has confirmed . Cases have also been found in Powys and in the Hywel Dda Health Board area - which covers Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire. Typical symptoms of measles include fever, cough, conjunctivitis and a rash. Complications are quite common even in healthy people, and about 20% of reported measles cases experience one or more complications. These can include ear infections, vomiting and diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis and serious eye disorders. Before the introduction of the MMR jab in 1988, about half a million children caught measles each year in the UK. Approximately 100 of those died. However, concerns over the jab's safety were raised in the late 1990s when Dr Wakefield produced a since discredited paper suggesting MMR was linked to an increased risk of autism. Professor David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department of Health, said the problems in Wales were ‘historic’ due to Dr Wakefield's discredited claim. Generally, the vaccination message was getting through to parents, he told BBC Breakfast. ‘Our immunisation coverage rates, currently, are extremely high, 95% of children are being vaccinated in this country,’ he said. Asked about the situation in Wales, . he said: ‘That is a historic problem, the legacy of bizarre suggestions . about vaccines and autism from 15 years ago, that's not the situation . currently.’ He added: ‘The evidence is that MMR . among parents of young children is not viewed as unsafe, as it was a . decade and 15 years ago. Attitudes have indeed changed. ‘The issue we're dealing with is not . parents of young children currently, it's parents of children from 15 . years ago, and they're the ones that we need to get back and vaccinate.’","Dr Andrew Wakefield linked MMR jab to autism but research was discredited .

The fact that she and her family members were profiting from the notoriety she earned from the killing of her ex boyfriend Travis Alexander has not stopped apparent fans from shelling out over $3,000 for a piece of Arias' artwork. Earlier today, her mother confirmed that the colored pencil drawings made by Arias were being sold through a third party.

On the auction block: Her Grace Kelly portrait (left) was the highest earner so far, with a final price tag of $3,050 while 'Pisces' (right) sold for $1,525 .

Her friend Donovan Bering told a local Fox affiliate that she and the 32-year-old accused killer speak by phone most nights and discuss different parts of the day's court dealings. 'She'll call and say ""I have a quote."" We'll talk about it. Sometimes she says ""let's tweet."" And then she'll say ""no let's not do it,""' Ms Bering told MyFoxPhoenix.

She is the former anorexic turned plus-size model who has made headlines for years for her fluctuating weight. But Crystal Renn, now a size 8, is these days catching the world's attention for a different reason: by confessing her hopes of designing a clothing line 'with body diversity in mind', and by smouldering as the face and body of a number of high-end fashion campaigns. The stunning 26-year-old's latest job sees her striking a pose for Net-A-Porter's digital magazine in seductive summer shoot. Smouldering: Crystal Renn's latest fashion shoot was for net-a-porter's digital magazine and she smouldered in a black ensemble . Donning stylish black ensembles from . Alessandra Rich, Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane, Nina Ricci, Emilio . Pucci, Gucci, Giuseppe Zanotti and Stella McCartney, Crystal stuns in . the shots by photographer Laura Sciacovelli. As one of the most talked about models in the world, Crystal opened up to the magazine about her modelling career and all-or-nothing approach to life. The model - who recently expressed a belief that sample sizes should all be size 8 - explained that when she has a goal she chases it with gusto - and fashion was always on her radar. The supermodel revealed that she put up pictures by fashion photographer Steven Meisel in her teenage bedroom while peers were hanging posters of Leonardo DiCaprio, and judging by her burgeoning fashion CV, it sure paid off. Svelte: Crystal, who hit the headlines for her fluctuating weight, revealed that she wants to be known for her work not her frame . She may have made a name for herself as the girl who suffered from an eating disorder while trying to maintain her . size 0 figure when she first started out, then shot up to a size 16, but Crystal would like her work, rather than her frame, . to be the reason for her fame. She said: 'I need to know if I should elongate my neck, put my . shoulders down. It's all about the details.' Happy days: Insisting that she is happy with the way she looks now, Crystal has previously revealed that she doesn't let her body dictate whether she's content or not . In her book Hungry, published in 2010, she candidly chronicled her tale of living and working with anorexia. It was only when she allowed herself to feel secure at her 'natural weight' and became healthy again - in both body and mind - that her career took off. Since losing weight, Crystal has . found success as a straight-size model, and has starred in campaigns for . companies including Jimmy Choo and, most recently, Agent Provocateur. Insisting she is happy with the way she now looks, Crystal has previously revealed in interviews: 'I don't let my body dictate whether I'm happy or not. The goal is to go live, and worry about the rest later.' And Crystal added that regardless of her dress size, the most important thing is to eat healthily and maintain a balanced diet. Fluctuating weight: Crystal, who suffered from anorexia while trying to maintain her size 0 (UK size 4) figure when she started out as a model, was forced to address criticism that she was pressured into losing weight . She said: 'It's about the healthy eating habits that you have, and wherever your body falls. Whether that is actually a 4 or an 18, doesn't matter.' She now has grand ambitions for the future and explained that if she no longer wants to be behind the lens she has a few other ideas up her stylish sleeve. She said: 'Photography, creative directing, styling, acting... I would never commit . to just one. 'A big goal for me is to design a fashion line . with body diversity in mind.' And judging by her life motto ('I've always believed that anything is possible. Maybe that’s my secret') and current career successes, she will make that happen.","The 26-year-old poses for and speaks to Net-A-Porter's digital magazine .

But software giant Apple now look set to take their domination of the digital world a step further as they plan to challenge the likes of Spotify by launching a music streaming service. The company are reportedly to launch the service, which could be called iRadio, later this year with talks in progress with the three main music companies - Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony. Negotiations with Universal and Warner are said to be more advanced. It is believed that the aim is to encourage users to download songs from its ten year old iTunes store - already the biggest music retailer in the world - by introducing them to new artists. The service will reportedly be free, according to the Guardian, and paid for by advertising. Apple will have another new rival looking to gain its share of the market with Twitter set to launch a similar service this weekend. The new service, designed by Australian firm We Are Hunted, called #music will allow people to tweet music suggestions to their friends, follow their favourite artists andlisten to tracks from Soundcloud and iTunes. Twitter will showcase #music at the Coachella festival. It is no surprise that Apple is apparently looking to dominate one of the fastest growing markets in the entertainment world.

A family has been branded 'morally repugnant' by a coroner investigating the death of a young mother who sipped 'cannabis fertiliser' from a Sprite bottle in their kitchen. Sarah Moss, 23, of Mottram, Hyde, Greater Manchester, drank the highly-toxic fluid while staying at the home of her boyfriend Daniel Fairbrother, who had left it on the side in the kitchen. Her face swelled to twice its normal size and she started vomiting a foul-smelling black substance, an inquest heard. Inquest: Sarah Moss, 23, died after inadvertently drinking 'cannabis fertiliser' stored in a Sprite bottle at her boyfriend Daniel Fairbrother's house . Daniel Fairbrother and his mother Julie . took Ms Moss to A&E at Tameside Hospital, where they told doctors the . bottle contained fish tank neutraliser. Tameside coroner Joanne Kearsley . Even when it emerged that the damage to the young mother's throat was so severe her oesophagus was corroded to a 'piece of string', her weight plummeted to 5st and the bottle was found to contain an extremely high level of alkaline, the Fairbrothers stuck to their claim. She died at Tameside Hospital in June 2011 after six months of agony. Before her death, Ms Moss told her mother Lynn Moss that her boyfriend later confessed the bottle contained cannabis fertiliser. The inquest also heard from detectives who found a cannabis farm at the Fairbrothers' Stalybridge home, for which Daniel's brother James was jailed. But throughout the hearing, the Fairbrothers maintained the liquid was fish tank neutraliser which they had found at a house clearance. 'Morally repugnant': The evidence from James Fairbrother (left), his brother Daniel Fairbrother (centre), and their mother Julie (right), was 'at best inconsistent' the coroner said . 'Much loved': Ms Moss died as a result of post-operative complications on injuries she sustained after ingestiion of a corrosive substance, the coroner said . Summing up at the hearing in Stockport, Tameside coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'It beggars belief as to what an unbelievably stupid, naive and thoughtless act it was, not only placing such a liquid in a Sprite bottle but to then crassly leave the bottle where anyone could have taken a drink from it. 'The evidence from the witnesses Julie, Daniel and James [Fairbrother] was at best inconsistent, but in my view was a continued attempt to maintain a fabricated account - an account concocted on the day in order to protect themselves and to try and hide the real reason they'd had such liquid in their possession. 'Ignorance and arrogance': Before her death Sarah Moss told her mother that Daniel Fairbrother (pictured) had confessed the bottle contained cannabis fertiliser . 'Despite not knowing the extent of the injuries suffered by Sarah, there was no one who attended at A&E that night prepared to give an honest account to the medical staff as to what was known about the liquid.' She added: 'The ignorance and arrogance of those attending with Sarah that night, even when medical staff were doing their best to contact the National Poisons Information Service and trying to find out as much information as possible, I find astounding and morally repugnant.' She said the liquid was not acquired or left on the side with the intent of trying to harm anyone, but added: 'I have no doubt that the presence of cannabis in the property was a fact known to everyone who stayed there and that the liquid was not something they intended to use for the fish tank.' Ms Moss's family welcomed the coroner's verdict and said the Fairbrothers failed to help her. Her mother Lynn Moss said: 'We wish to thank the coroner for her thorough and perceptive investigation. 'The family wishes to echo the words of the coroner in relation to the moral repugnance of individuals who could and should have helped Sarah.' She added: 'Sarah never understood why she didn't receive an apology from Daniel for leaving the Sprite bottle out before she died. 'Sarah was a much loved and is a much-missed mummy, daughter, sister, sister-in-law, auntie, niece and friend. She will continue to be in our everyday thoughts and loving memories.' Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said Ms Moss died as a result of post-operative complications on injuries she sustained after ingestion of a corrosive substance. A Tameside Hospital spokesman said: 'Sarah Moss was admitted to Tameside Hospital following ingestion of a highly-corrosive liquid which had a severely destructive effect upon her major internal organs. This injury can be associated with a poor outlook irrespective of management. 'After a difficult period of recuperation, a finely balanced clinical decision was made in conjunction with Sarah and her family to undertake surgery to increase the quality of her life. 'The coroner indicated that the efforts the hospital made were with the best of intentions, but sadly Sarah suffered post-operative complications leading to her untimely death.' The family's solicitor, Zak Golombeck from Manchester law firm, Pannone said: 'It is regrettable that the evidence that has been heard demonstrates that Sarah's death could have been avoided with proper treatment.'","Sarah Moss drank substance from Sprite bottle at boyfriend's home .

A tiny hymnal from 1640 believed to be the first book ever printed in what is now the United States is going up for auction, and it could sell for as much as $30 million. Only 11 copies of the Bay Psalm Book survive in varying degrees of completeness. Members of Boston's Old South Church have authorized the sale of one of its two copies at Sotheby's Nov. 26. 'It's a spectacular book, arguably one of the most important books in this nation's history,' said the Rev. Nancy Taylor, senior minister and CEO of the church, which was established in 1669. Samuel Adams was a member and Benjamin Franklin was baptized there. Historic reasure: A tiny hymnal from 1640 believed to be the first book ever printed in what is now the United States is going up for auction, and it could sell for as much as $30 million . Owners: Old South Church in Boston owns two 1640 copies of the Bay Psalm Book . At one time, the church owned five copies of the 6-by-5-inch hymnal. One is now at the Library of Congress, another at Yale University and a third at Brown University. Taylor says the church voted to sell one of its two remaining copies— both in 'excellent condition' — to increase its grants, ministries and 'strengthen our voice in general as a progressive Christian church.' The book was published in Cambridge, Mass., by the Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It came just 20 years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. The hymnal was supposed to be a faithful translation into English of the original Hebrew psalms — puritans believed selected paraphrases would compromise their salvation. The 1,700 copies were printed on a press shipped over from London. A yellowed title page, adorned with decorative flourishes, reads: 'The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Faithfully Translated into English Metre.' At the bottom, it says: 'Imprinted 1640.' Historians believe an almanac may have . come off the press before the Bay Psalm Book. But Mark Dimunation, chief . of rare books and special collections at the Library of Congress, says . the almanac was more of a pamphlet or a broadsheet rather than a book. No copy of the almanac exists today. He notes that in the Americas, in . general, books were printed in what is now Mexico as early as 1539. Artifact: Shortly after arriving at Plymouth Rock in 1620, the Puritans set about to translate and produce a version of the Book of Psalms that was a closer paraphrase of the Hebrew original than the one they had carried from England . The Bay Psalm Book is 'an iconic piece. It's the beginning of literate America,' said Dimunation. 'American poetry, American spirituality and the printed page all kind of combine and find themselves located in a single volume.' 'But there's also something much more modest and humble about this piece, which makes its survival all the most extraordinary,' he said, noting that the hymnals were utilitarian books that were subjected to a lot of wear and tear. The last time a copy came on the auction block in 1947, it sold for a record auction price of $151,000. At the time, it surpassed auction prices for the Gutenberg Bible, Shakespeare's First Folio and John James Audubon's 'Birds of America.'","The tiny hymnal was printed in 1640 by Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony .

A young mother suffered a massive stroke after she was wrongly sent home from hospital because there were no specialists on duty over the weekend to assess a brain scan. Ruth Stanton was aged just 30 when she was admitted to hospital after suffering two mini-strokes over 48 hours. Doctors carried out two brain scans, but failed to give her a diagnosis because it was a Friday evening and the specialist neurologist was not on site. Before: Ruth Stanton on her wedding day to Kerry before she suffered a stroke aged 30 . After: Mrs Stanton, from Bognor Regis, following her stroke. Now 36, her husband says she is still learning to speak again after being left permanently brain damaged. The stroke could have been prevented by an aspirin . Instead they sent the mother-of-two home without treatment and that night she suffered a massive stroke in bed. Her husband, Kerry, 47, discovered his wife, who worked in a building society, slumped on the floor of their bedroom, unable to speak or move. Mrs Stanton, whose two children Caelan and Safiya were aged just five and one when the stroke occurred, suffered permanent brain damage. She was unable to speak and is still learning to read and write again. She also has short-term memory problems, suffers from depression and is unlikely to ever work again. Last month (March) the couple were awarded a six-figure sum in damages following a seven year fight for justice. But Mr Stanton, an executive chef, said that no amount of money could compensate for how his family life had been irrevocably damaged by the blunder. Mr Stanton said: ‘Ruth changed overnight from a happy, vibrant, independent woman to a shadow of her former self and our family life will never be the same again. Happier times: Mrs Stanton was a 'bubbly, vibrant character', before she was struck down by her stroke, according to Kerry . ‘The stroke destroyed Ruth, she  is a former grade A student but now everything is a struggle. She has had to learn to speak again and still has difficulty talking. She can’t sit and read the children stories, or help them with their homework and our seven-year-old daughter is teaching her how to read and write. ‘Despite this, she can understand everything that’s going on, which is very frustrating for her. She suffers from depression and has talked numerous times of not wanting to be here anymore.’ Mrs Stanton, a keen horse rider who visited the gym several times a week, suffered the first mini-stroke while visiting her mother, Rosemary Francis, 61,on November 15 2006. While waiting for a blood test at her GP surgery the following day she suffered another small stroke and the decision was made to go straight to Worcester Hospital. She was admitted and underwent a CT scan, then an MRI scan the following day. However, medics failed to make a diagnosis and instead said they wanted a specialist neurologist, who was not at the hospital, to take a look at the scans. Because it was a Friday evening the specialist wasn’t available and, although the scans showed signs of abnormality, medics made the decision to discharge Mrs Stanton, who was told to wait for an out patient’s appointment, instead. She returned home and went to bed but suffered the stroke in the middle of the night. A medical expert provided evidence to the couple’s solicitor that prescribing a simple dose of aspirin for Mrs Stanton, now 36, would have prevented it occurring. Mr Stanton, of Bognor Regis, West Sussex, added: ‘If the hospital had given Ruth aspirin and monitored her effectively the stroke would have been avoided. ‘The sad truth is if Ruth had suffered her mini-strokes on a Monday she would probably had better care because there would have been more doctors and more specialists on duty. ‘Unfortunately, Ruth was sent home on a Friday night because the doctors knew nothing could be done over the weekend. ‘We put our trust in those doctors and unfortunately they let Ruth down. Worcestershire Acute NHS Trust has agreed to pay the family a six-figure compensation package after a seven-year battle . ‘Instructing solicitors was never about getting compensation, it was about getting some answers for Ruth. As it turns out we now know that someone didn’t do enough for her, which doesn’t make it any better or give her any closure.’ Tests later revealed Mrs Stanton was suffering from Takayasu's arteritis, a rare disease caused by the inflammation of the walls of the largest arteries in the body, which makes sufferers more susceptible to strokes. She has been treated with aspirin on an on-going basis and has not suffered another stroke since. Dr Solomon Almond, a consultant physician, provided evidence on Mrs Stanton’s care for her legal case. He said: ‘There was a failure to recognise the signs of stroke and to appreciate the initial scan findings. Mrs Stanton was initially discharged without any treatment and it is likely aspirin would have been beneficial.’ Sue Taylor, a medical negligence lawyer at JMW Solicitors, who represented Mrs Stanton, said: ‘This is an absolutely tragic case of a young woman with a loving family who has been struck down in her prime. ‘The quality of care provided to sufferers can mean the difference between a full recovery and permanent disability, so it is absolutely vital that the NHS is making sure its healthcare staff are able to provide fast diagnosis and treatment.’ A spokesman for Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said the hospital was ‘pleased’ a settlement had been reached with Mrs Stanton, but added: ‘The Trust has made no admission of liability.’","Ruth Stanton, of Bognor Regis, West Sussex, left struggling to speak and look after her children .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:02 EST, 26 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:56 EST, 26 January 2013 . The mother of a second child cared for by Irish nanny Aisling McCarthy Brady –who was with her at the time emergency services were summoned to the ailing Rehma Sabir – asked her to babysit the next day. The twist in the horrific story is one of a number of revelations that emerged yesterday and that Mrs McCarthy Brady’s defence attorney says are anomalies which ‘just don’t add up’. Last night neighbours of Mrs McCarthy Brady’s husband, Don McCarthy, told the Irish Mail on Sunday that while his wife remains in prison, he has left the home they shared. A police mugshot of Irish nanny Aisling McCarthy Brady, 34. Brady has been arraigned on assault and battery on a child for allegedly violently injuring a one-year old child while in her care who later died . Police claim that the 34-year-old nanny, who moved from Co. Cavan to the US in 2002, assaulted year-old Rehma Sabir on January 14, causing head injuries. The child died two days later. But now a series of details that contradict the prosecution’s account are emerging. Among them are the identities of two other women who were in the apartment with Mrs McCarthy Brady as she tried to revive the baby. While the prosecution statement says that Rehma’s father Sameer, a British national, ‘left the home at 7.30am to take his in-laws to the airport’, a Boston Herald report, based on an interview with Mrs McCarthy Brady’s defence attorney, says his mother-in-law was at their apartment that afternoon and tried to revive the child. The other woman present was the mother of the second child, a seven-month-old boy who had been entrusted to Mrs McCarthy Brady’s care as part of a nanny-sharing arrangement involving Rehma’s mother Nadi Siddiqui. Now it has emerged in the Boston Herald that the second mother, who has not been named, asked Mrs McCarthy Brady to babysit her son as Rehma lay dying in ­hospital. The nanny received the request by text while with Rehma’s parents at the hospital where the little girl was fighting for life. Grave claims: Aisling McCarthy Brady, 34, is accused of hitting a one-year-old girl who was in her care in the head, which resulted in her death . Parents: The baby's mother was Nada Siddiqui, 29, left, a Princeton University-educated financial analyst and her father was Harvard educated Sameer Sabir, right . Prosecutors say Rehma suffered a violent assault that left spinal injuries ‘consistent with the slamming of a child’. She was taken to hospital with multiple fractures, bleeding behind her eyes and swelling on her brain. The prosecutor’s statement details scans showing up long bone fractures on the baby’s left forearm and left leg, along with compression fractures on her spine. The documents also note that some of the injuries dated back weeks or even months. Melinda Thomson, Mrs ­McCarthy Brady’s lawyer, told the Boston Herald that her client was ‘devastated, totally devastated’, adding: ‘I have gone through the police report line by line, over and over and over again. I can’t sleep thinking about this. Things just don’t add up.’ She added that Mrs ­McCarthy Brady faces weeks of waiting, as prosecutors will study the autopsy report in detail before moving forward with their case. Meanwhile, neighbours of Mrs McCarthy Brady said that her husband David has left their marital home at Beale Street, Quincy. A neighbour said: ‘He’s moved out and won’t be back, as far as we know. Someone came in the middle of the night and removed his car and his things.’ Cork-born David McCarthy was said to have been ‘floored’ by the allegations. Last night, attorney Elaine Whitfield Sharp, who defended Louise Woodward, the British au pair accused of murdering her eight-month-old charge in 1997, said Mrs McCarthy Brady’s case was ‘winnable’ for the defence. ‘The timing is what is crucial here,’ she said of the events of January 14, when Rehma was taken to hospital. ‘That is what the defence is going to rely on. What other people had access (to the child) and when did they have access.'","Aisling McCarthy Brady, 34, apparently received text while with Rehma's parents .

Moustachioed: Middle-Eastern men are increasingly seeking moustache implants as they are associated with wisdom and maturity. Role models, such as Turkish singer Ibrahim Tatlises, above, are thought to have encouraged the boom . For many men, the constant struggle to tame their facial hair with a razor is something of a nuisance. But an increasing number of men in Middle Eastern countries are seeking innovative ways of achieving a hairier upper lip, with a boom in moustache implants. The innovative treatment is proving popular with men from in the Arab world, where moustaches are seen to convey wisdom and maturity. One plastic surgeon based in Turkey said that patients are flocking from Middle Eastern countries to receive the treatment. Selahattin Tulunay said that he performs the procedure, known as follicular unit extraction, between 50 to 60 times every month. The intricate procedure involves the surgeon taking a clump of hairs from areas of more dense growth, before they are implanted in the moustache area. Explaining the surge in recent years of Middle Eastern men travelling to receive the treatment, Dr Tulunay said: 'For some men who look young and junior, . they think (a mustache) is a must to look senior...more professional . and wise. They think it is prestigious.' The treatment, which is performed under local anesthetic, costs up to $7000 (£4370) and requires the subject to abstain from shaving for fifteen days. The transplant is expected to produce results after six months. Dr Tulunay told CNN that celebrities, such as hirsute Turkish singer and actor Ibrahim Tatlises, often act as 'role models' for those seeking the treatment. The surgeon also revealed that he had performed the procedure on politicians who wanted a moustache to boost their image. The moustache is commonplace in the highest echelons of Middle Eastern politics, with many politicians seeing the facial hair as conferring power, wisdom and nobility. All of Iraq's leaders, including Saddam Hussein, have sported a moustache. Power:  Moustaches are commonplace in Middle Eastern politics, as displayed by Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, left, and former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, right. The facial hair is thought to show personal honour, as well as masculinity . Current high-profile politicians in the Middle East, such as Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, rarely appear in public without a finely coiffed moustache. Moustaches are also known to symbolise personal honour in the Arab world, with several reported cases of people removing their opponent's moustaches to disgrace them. One of Saddam Hussein's former senior aides, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, once roared 'Curse be upon your mustache!' at a Kuwaiti politician during an emergency . summit of Islamic states in 2003. Paris-based surgeon Pierre Bouhanna told CNN that his business had boomed over the last five years. Mr Bouhanna said most of his patients travelled to France from Iran, Lebanon, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Turkey. He said most patients were aged between 30 and 50, adding: 'My impression is more and more they want to establish their male aspect. They want a strong mustache.'

After shivering through the longest winter in 50 years, Britain will experience the warmest day of the year this weekend. And for some lucky parts of the country, it might even be a good time to give the barbecue its first outing of the year. Temperatures could reach 21C (70F) tomorrow as the weather system which has led to bitter conditions over the last month finally clears. Spring finally arriving: At Footscray Meadows in Sidcup Kent there were no blossoms on the trees, but there were daffodils on the ground . Central and eastern England will  experience the most sunshine, with temperatures highest in East Anglia and London. The jet stream, the warm air current . which governs most weather in the northern hemisphere, has been diverted . south, missing the UK, making March among the chilliest recorded. But it will finally meander north over . the weekend, leading to warmer air across Britain and an end to the . wintry conditions that have recently blighted the country. Temperatures in London could reach 21C (70F), beating the year’s . previous high of 17.5C (64F) recorded in Trawscoed, Wales, on March 5. Despite warmer temperatures continuing next week, other parts   will still experience rain, cloud cover and wind tomorrow. The maximum temperature expected in Newcastle will be 16C (61F), while Cardiff will only see the mercury rise to 14C (57F). Turning around: On Saturday rain will start to move across the southern half of the country, although it will start off dry in most places . Higher: On Sunday rain is also predicated and will spread across the UK as the day progresses, although temperatures are set to reach the high teens in some areas . Supermarkets are nonetheless predicting that the emerging sun will lead to a surge in sales of barbecue and picnic products. Asda is stocking its shelves with sausages, burgers and ribs, expecting demand for meat products to jump by 60 per cent. The supermarket also expects  a surge in sales of ice cream, wine and salads. Asda spokesman Chris Carden said: ‘We . have waited a long time for some sunshine so it is no surprise shoppers . are looking to make the most of the hottest weekend of the year so far.’ Tesco has also increased supplies of . barbecue and salad items to some regions, with the supermarket expecting . to sell 600 tons of cherry tomatoes and to see a 60 per cent rise in . strawberry sales. Mixed bag: Britain prepares for gales and heavy rain accompanied by warm temperatures this weekend . Bitter: March was the coldest on record for over 50 years, with an average temperature across the country of just 2.2C . Andy Ratcliffe, from forecaster Meteogroup, sought to dampen expectations for the weekend despite the temperature surge. He said: ‘It will be mostly fine and . warm in central and eastern England on Sunday, with highs of 20C (68F) to 21C (70F) in London, but everywhere else can expect rain, with some . heavy pulses which will ease throughout the day.’ He said that temperatures will remain high next week but will fail to match those of tomorrow. The Met Office’s Dan Williams said the weekend’s highest temperatures are a 50 per cent increase on seasonal averages. But he also warned that conditions . will be far from ideal in some places, adding: ‘It will also be breezy . and cloudy, with some light, sporadic showers.’ Temperatures in March were an average . of just 2.5C (36.5f) between March 1 and 26, according to the Met .

Outside of the court, Dixon’s mother, Sandra Mitchell, said that her daughter is scared and called the charges ‘very troublesome.’ ‘We don't know how they came up with these serious charges. It's an out-of-the-blue charge. They just want someone to charge that homicide to,’ said John Ambrosio, Dixon's attorney. The police statement said that the department is ‘aware of the concern and anxiety this crime has caused the community and wishes to provide a limited update of the case.’ Dixon’s bail was set at $1million.

While James Bond seems to drive at high speed in flashy cars, Craig successfully completed his five-hour 'responsible driving course' without a hitch. The only concession for the British star was that officials allowed him to take the classroom test on his own for fear his presence would be put off other licence hopefuls. A spokesman for the Professional . Driving School of America in New York said: ‘His assistant requested a . special class for Daniel himself. No other students were there. ‘He was such a nice dude, so friendly.’ The driving licence has a photo ID and is used as the primary form of identification in the U.S. Tested alone: Craig, pictured in the Quantum of Solace, took his classroom test by himself so as not to put off other licence hopefuls .

Craig’s classroom work would have included watching videos and lectures on how to execute correct turns, driving in extreme weather and also the dangers of drink-driving. His licence will be valid for 10 years.

Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for doping last October, is said to be considering admitting publicly that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions during his disgraced cycling career. Armstrong, 41, is reported to have told anti-doping officials that he will make a public admission of guilt in the hope than he can persuade them to restore his eligibility to compete in triathlons, which have replaced cycling as his sporting passion. For more than a decade, Armstrong has vehemently denied ever doping, even after anti-doping officials laid out their case against him last October in a report which accused him of  running 'the most . sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport . has ever seen.' Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong is reportedly considering admitting publicly that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs . All Armstrong's results from August 1, . 1998 were expunged from the record books, including his seven . consecutive Tour de France 'wins' from 1999 to 2005, and the 41-year-old . was banned from cycling for life. Up . until now Armstrong has refused to cooperate with the investigation and . has consistently denied wrongdoing, but he has been under pressure from . various fronts to confess. Wealthy . supporters of Livestrong, the charity he founded after surviving . testicular cancer, have been trying to persuade him to come forward so . he could clear his conscience and save the organization from further . damage. According to The New York Times, Armstrong has been in discussions with the United States Anti-Doping Agency and met the agency’s chief executive, Travis Tygart, in an effort to mitigate the lifetime ban he received for playing a lead role in doping on his Tour-winning teams. Armstrong is also seeking to meet with David Howman, the director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Since . quitting cycling, Armstrong has hopes of competing in triathlons and . running events, but those competitions are often sanctioned by . organizations that adhere to the World Anti-Doping Code, under which . Armstrong received his lifetime ban. Despite damning evidence Armstrong has yet to admit any wrongdoing although that could be about to change . According to the code, an athlete might be eligible for a reduced punishment if he fully confesses and details how he doped, who helped him dope and how he got away with doping. Armstrong has been keeping a low profile since doping revelations ruined his once illustrious career and reputation. In November he was spotted canoeing in the warm Pacific waters just off Hawaii.

A primetime Channel 4 quiz in which drunken comedians made obscene jokes about the Queen has outraged viewers. The Big Fat Quiz Of 2012, which featured countless vile sexual jokes, was broadcast on Sunday only seconds after the 9pm watershed. The pre-recorded show, presented by controversial comedian Jimmy Carr, also featured puerile remarks about sprinter Usain Bolt, President Obama and singer Susan Boyle. Scroll down for video . Crude: Channel 4 has been further criticised for broadcasting Big Fat Quiz of the Year, which featured guests Richard Ayoade, Russell Howard, Jonathan Ross, Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall, James Cordon and Gabby Logan . Last night TV watchdog Ofcom confirmed it had already received complaints. Most of the crass humour came from Gavin And Stacey star James Corden, 34, and comedian Jack Whitehall, 24, who were seen to drink a bottle of wine each on screen. They were egged on by Jonathan Ross – who left the BBC after making an abusive phone call to the veteran actor Andrew Sachs during a radio show. Channel 4 last night stood accused of failing to learn from the Sachsgate scandal, which was also a pre-recorded broadcast. Margaret Morrissey, founder of campaign group Parents Outloud, said: ‘It is amazing this programme was ever broadcast. This was not live television, someone made the decision to allow this to go out at 9pm during the holidays when young children will still be up and watching television. ‘It’s as if broadcasters have learned nothing from the Sachsgate scandal. This is proof that we need a clean-up of television.’ Within minutes of the annual quiz show starting guests began to make infantile jokes about the Queen and the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Marlborough-educated Whitehall said he ‘had a theory’ about why the Queen had stood up throughout the jubilee pageant on the Thames. He then made a crude joke linking it to the fact that Prince Philip was taken ill with a bladder infection soon afterwards. He justified his offensive remarks by saying: ‘I’m just saying what everyone’s thinking.’ Soon afterwards he said Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt could ‘rake it in’ by going to stud like the retired racehorse Frankel. His vulgar language appeared to draw gasps from the audience, but the remarks were eagerly followed up with a disgusting comment by 52-year-old Ross. Halfway through the two-hour show Corden took a bottle of red wine and two glasses from beneath his desk and poured himself and Whitehall a drink, then started eating pizza. The pair were soon visibly drunk and Corden was slurring his words. He then started to make crude comments about Britain’s Got Talent star Susan Boyle after he was asked what hashtag was used to promote her album on Twitter. His answer was: ‘Subo loves it in the a***.’ He then laughed as he said: ‘This is where I do myself in and I forget we are recording this and this is going to be on TV’, before repeating: ‘She clearly loves it in the a***.’ Corden and Whitehall continued to get more drunk and host Carr later pointed out that the pair had drunk a bottle of wine each. Afterwards Whitehall told his Twitter followers: ‘We got so drunk.’ Viewers took to Twitter and television forums to vent their dismay even as the programme was being broadcast. Targets: The comics made crude jokes about gold medal sprinter Usain Bolt, left, and singer Susan Boyle, right . Bad taste: Comedian Jack Whitehall made rude comments about the Queen, left, and the recent illness of her husband Prince Philip, right . One wrote on the Digital Spy entertainment website: ‘Forgive me for not laughing at people being immature idiots. But how is that comedy? It’s just inane, immature stupidity. I haven’t laughed once.’ Another added: ‘Glad Jimmy is seeing the funny side of things – as I ain’t.’ A third wrote: ‘A lot of canned laughter overlaid over the (probably) barely laughing audience. It’s a chore watching this.’ As the programme approached its conclusion Corden and Whitehall made crass jokes about Mr Obama. Asked what the President did in the Oval Office when he was pretending to work, they responded by writing down: ‘Put a condom on and had a posh w***.’ Fellow guests sports presenter Gabby Logan, 39, and actor Richard Ayoade, 35, looked increasingly awkward as the jokes continued. On Twitter, viewers were commenting on how drunk Whitehall and Corden were. And on the Mumsnet website one user wrote: ‘Jack and James were really annoying me with their drunken childishness. When Jonathan Ross seems like the most grown-up person there you know it’s time to edit them out.’ Ofcom had received five complaints by last night, but that number could quickly grow – in Sachsgate, an initial two complaints rose to nearly 45,000. Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe said: ‘Nothing Jimmy Carr does surprises me. This programme is in extremely poor taste and I’m amazed it was ever broadcast. ‘Most people would consider it to be in very bad taste to poke fun at someone in their 80s who’s served the country devotedly for 60 years.’ Mrs Morrissey of Parents Outloud added: ‘No doubt there’ll be a storm of outrage and then the comedians will turn around and be all contrite. ‘But they could have avoided offending people and corrupting young minds. Even if their parents stop them, children can still watch it on their iPads and iPhones. The nation’s television now serves the lowest common denominator.’ A spokesman for Susan Boyle would not comment, but a source close to the singer said: ‘Their comments were inappropriate.’ A spokesman for Corden said: ‘James would never want to offend anyone and is sorry if his comments have been taken out of the context they were made in.’ A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘Big Fat Quiz Of The Year is a well-established comedic and satirical review of the year’s events with well-known guests and is broadcast after the watershed with appropriate warnings.’ Channel 4 has often been at the centre of controversy. In 2007 tens of thousands complained that Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty was the victim of racist bullying on Celebrity Big brother. Viewers also protested about a ‘dramatised documentary’ about Prince Harry in 2010 in which an actor playing the prince was shown being subjected to a mock execution in Afghanistan. Also in 2010 the broadcaster showed comedian Frankie Boyle making ‘highly offensive’ jokes about the disabled son of model Katie Price.","Big Fat Quiz of 2012 featured countless vile sexual jokes just after 9pm .

Scars: Kieron Bell shows the surgical scar cut after his wife Sarah stabbed him in the chest with a steak knife . A man who was subjected to terrifying violence at the hands of his petite wife has described the moment she plunged a steak knife into his heart. Kieron Bell, 36, only found the courage to leave his wife Sarah after she stabbed him and left him to die. Even after she was jailed Kieron found it hard to admit he had been a victim of domestic violence at the hands of his wife. But he hopes telling his story will . encourage more men to come forward. He said: 'There is a misconception . that men who are victims are weak but that couldn't be more wrong.' Kieron, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was a strapping nightclub bouncer when he became a victim of domestic violence. Though . the married father of one had no problem throwing drunks out of . nightclubs night after night, in his own home he was the victim of a . series of brutal attacks - at the hands of his pretty young wife. Petite Sarah Bell, then 24, had attacked her husband regularly since they married in June 2006. But . her reign of violence ended when she stabbed Kieron through the heart . with a steak knife at their flat and the police were called. Kieron nearly died, but lying Sarah tried to persuade police that Kieron had fallen on the knife. After . life saving heart surgery which has left him with a ten inch scar on . his chest, Kieron has made a slow recovery, but now wants to warn other . men not to tolerate violence in a relationship. 'I . stayed because I loved her and because we had a child but it nearly . cost me my life. I'm lucky to be alive and one day I will have to tell . my son that his mother almost killed me.' 'Domestic violence against men is a . big problem. Because women are seen as the vulnerable ones, people don't . understand how men can allow themselves to be victims. Family: Sarah began lashing out when she fell pregnant with their son . 'I'm speaking out because when I . finally found the courage to tell Norfolk Police what had happened they . were brilliant, they didn't judge me and they took me seriously so I . want other men to know they can report attacks. 'If it can happen to me it can happen to anyone.' Kieron met Sarah when he was working the door of a Great Yarmouth nightclub. At 5ft 10ins tall and with a stocky build, Kieron had a reputation as a gentle giant. Sarah was a tiny size eight blonde and . just and 5ft 2ins tall. After a whirlwind romance they discovered Sarah . was expecting and decided to marry. 'We were really happy and I thought she was a great girl. I thought we'd be the perfect family.' Happy beginnings: After a whirlwind romance they discovered Sarah was expecting and decided to marry . But . following their marriage at Great Yarmouth registry office, Sarah . started to show signs of a ferocious temper. 'She would flare up at the . smallest thing. I put it down to her pregnancy hormones to start with.' But as Sarah's bump grew she started . to become violent. 'If we were bickering she would suddenly lash out. She would kick me or punch me. Sometimes she slapped me in front of . people. 'I would never in a . million years hit a woman because my mother always told me not to so I . would go out for a walk to calm down.' 'When I come back she would say sorry and promise not to do it again.' 'I . was confused and to start with never even considered what was happening . as domestic violence because you just don't think it happens to . blokes.' But Sarah's violence got worse and on one occasion she hit her husband with a glass bottle. Kieron did call police to the flat, but was scared they would laugh if he told them he was being abused by his wife. Deceiving appearances: Sarah's violence got worse after they married and on one occasion she hit her husband with a glass bottle . Two faces of abuse: Social services had become concerned about Sarah's temper and her son was moved into the care of Keiron's aunt, but nobody suspected that Kieron too was in danger . He hoped her behaviour would improve when their baby was born. Their son was born in February 2007 and Sarah's temper worsened. 'Arguments normally started over the flat, If I hadn't done enough jobs or it wasn't tidy enough. One time in a row she threatened to stab me but I never thought she ever would.' Ashamed to admit what was happening, he kept the violence a secret from friends and family. The police were called several more times but Kieron was always too ashamed to take it any further. 'I didn't expect them to believe me, I mean who's going to think a big former doorman can be battered by a tiny little woman. People wouldn't take it seriously.' Social services had become concerned about Sarah's temper and her son was moved into the care of Keiron's aunt, but nobody suspected that Kieron too was in danger. But on the 22 April 2009  at 1.45am Sarah came home later and started an argument with Kieron after accusing him of not doing enough around the house. 'It was typical of her to start an argument about the house, but no matter how much I did she would never be happy.' On their wedding day: Sarah pleaded guilty to wounding with . intent and was sentenced to four a half years at Norwich Crown Court. She is due for release this month . Moments later she ran at him with a steak knife from their kitchen, plunging it into his chest and fleeing as Kieron slumped dying on the floor in a pool of blood. He called 999 and an ambulance arrived as Sarah returned and in front of medics urged her husband to tell them it was 'nobody's fault.' 'Tell them honey,' she pleaded as he slipped into unconsciousness. They rushed him to hospital for heart surgery. Sarah tried to persuade police that Kieron fell on the knife, but Kieron later admitted the truth, that he was a victim of domestic violence. Sarah was arrested while he underwent life saving open heart surgery and spent a week in hospital. 'They said I was lucky to be alive. The knife had missed my heart by a millimetre and I was in intensive care for five days.' 'When I finally admitted how long it had been going on I was relieved it was out in the open and surprised at how good Norfolk Police were. Nobody treated it as a joke in fact they told me more was being done to help men in my situation. 'They gave me a lot of support in the run up to the case. Now I know there is no shame in what happened to me. Warning: Kieron has now married again but says the domestic violence he suffered will always affect him. He decided to speak out in the hope of encouraging more men to come forward . Kieron moved in with his aunt and son to recover. 'He came and gave me a really big cuddle. I felt lucky to be alive. 'I couldn't even pick my boy up to start with, that's when it really struck me what she'd done. She could have killed me, but she didn't think twice about taking away our son's dad. 'Admitting to people what had been going on was hard but having the police take it so seriously helped. Sarah pleaded guilty to wounding with intent and was sentenced to four a half years at Norwich Crown Court. She is due for release this month. Kieron has now married again but says the domestic violence he suffered will always affect him. ' I found it very hard to trust because of what happened.' Kieron decided to speak out in the hope of encouraging more men to come forward. After the case Det Insp Paul Garrard from Norfolk Police's domestic violence unit said that nobody regardless of gender needs to tolerate domestic abuse. 'Domestic abuse presents itself in many ways, it's about power and control. We are committed not only to investigation reports of domestic violence but also to encouraging victims, regardless of gender, to come forward to and report such matters.

The President and First Lady wished the troops a merry Christmas with a visit to a U.S. Marine base on Tuesday. His appearance with servicemen at a Christmas ceremony was his last public stop in Hawaii before he cuts short his vacation and flies back to Washington to return to negotiations over the fiscal cliff. Barack Obama is expected to arrive in Washington early Thursday, the White House said Tuesday night. Michelle Obama and the couple's two daughters will remain in Hawaii. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Honoring the troops: President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama visited Marines eating Christmas dinner at Marine Corps Base Hawaii . Nice to meet you: Obama personally thanked many of the Marines for their service to the nation . In the past, the president's end-of-the-year holiday in his native state had stretched into the new year. The first family had left Washington last Friday night. Congress has been expected to return to Washington late Thursday. Before he departed for Hawaii, Obama told reporters he expected to be back in the capital the following week. Automatic budget cuts and tax increases are set to begin on January 1, which many economists say could send the country back into recession. So far, the president and congressional Republicans have been unable to reach agreement on any alternatives. Lawmakers have expressed little but pessimism for the prospect of an agreement coming before the New Year. On Sunday, Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, said she expects any action in the waning days of the year to be 'a patch because in four days we can't solve everything.' Celebrity: The troops and their families lined to take photos of the Commander in Chief and meet him in person . Keeper: Many of the Marines left with a souvenir photo of President and Mrs Obama . The Obamas were spending the holiday at a rented home near Honolulu. On Christmas Day, the president and first lady visited with Marines to express thanks for their service. 'One of my favorite things is always coming to base on Christmas Day just to meet you and say thank you,' the president said at Marine Corps Base Hawaii's Anderson Hall. He said that being commander in chief was his greatest honor as president. Obama took photos with individual service members and their families. On Christmas Eve, Obama called members of the military to thank them for serving the nation, then joined his family for dinner, the White House said. The Obamas opened gifts Christmas morning, ate breakfast and sang carols. Honored: Obama serving as the leader of U.S. forces is the greatest honor of being president . Morale booster: Mr and Mrs Obama took time out of their Christmas to thank the troops for serving and offer them support . Friends were joining the Obamas for Christmas dinner Tuesday night, the White House said. President Obama and his wife Michelle celebrated Christmas from their tropical Hawaii getaway as they released a more festive looking picture of themselves onto their Twitter feed. Despite leaving for Mr. Obama's home state of on Friday, the pair released the seasonal picture to the White House twitter feed today and spoke together during the weekly presidential address of how much they enjoy a White House Christmas. Both the president and his wife spoke of the joy at spending the Holidays with loved ones and paid a special tribute to the men and women of the armed forces - serving abroad with their families in Afghanistan and in other deployments across the globe. Phoning in: Mrs Obama took phone calls on Christmas Eve from Children across the country as they helped track Santa Claus with the help of NORAD . 'Michelle and I want to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy Holidays': President Obama and his wife Michelle released this picture of them speaking during the weekly address from the White House on December 21st . 'So this week let’s give thanks for our veterans and their families,' the president said in this week's weekly address with his wife at his side. 'And let’s say a prayer for all our troops -- especially those in Afghanistan -- who are spending this holiday overseas, risking their lives to defend the freedoms we hold dear. Michelle Obama also urged Americans to think of military families. 'Across this country, military spouses have been raising their families all alone during those long deployments,' she said. 'And let’s not forget about our military kids, moving from base to base -- and school to school -- every few years, and stepping up to help out at home when mom or dad is away.' President Obama also spoke of the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast of America and the massacre of 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut. 'And this year, I know many of you are extending that kindness to the families who are still picking up the pieces from Hurricane Sandy and your prayers to the people of Newtown, Connecticut.,' he said. Arriving in Hawaii after a busy Friday in Washington, the president have been playing golf with his friends, traveling to the gym at the Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe and of course relaxing on the beach. He will probably be taking stock ahead of his second term inauguration in January after which he will have to confront some of the big issues that will cement or transform his legacy. Some of the big issues awaiting the president's decisions are familiar, long-simmering problems. They include immigration and the need for a tenable balance between taxes, spending and borrowing. President Barack Obama waves from the window of his motorcade vehicle as he returns from a workout at Marine Corp Base Hawaii, yesterday . Another issue, gun control, jumped to the national agenda's top tier this month following the massacre of first-graders and teachers in a Connecticut school. And the issue of climate change remains unresolved. Veteran politicians and presidential historians say it's almost impossible for Obama to ""go big"" on all these issues. Indeed, it might prove difficult to go big on even one. While some counsel caution, others urge the president to be as bold and ambitious as possible. That wasn't the case when she recently read Twas The Night Before Christmas at a Washington area children's hospital. As she sat down on stage to begin reading the classic tale to the tiny tots, Bo the First Dog jumped right up on his mother's lap. Unexpected: Though she knew Bo was at the vent, the First Lady clearly didn't expect the dog to get up on her lap . Making sure he can see: Michelle Obama held the book out in front of Bo so that he could 'read' along with her and the children during the recent Christmas event . He seemed quite comfy as well, since he didn't move from the position throughout the seven minute session. Bo is significantly larger than the former First Dog, Barney, who was a small Scottish terrier, and Portuguese Water Dogs can weigh up to 55 pounds. That was no matter for Michelle, however, as she gamefully played along and even jokingly held the book out so that the 4-year-old pup could 'read' along. Though the First Lady visited the Children's National Medical Center on December 14, the video was not released until Christmas Eve, in keeping with the theme of the story. Bo is a part of many of the White House traditions during the holidays, as he served as a sort of 'Waldo' figure throughout the decorations, with mini figurines in his likeness scattered throughout the many displays and 54 live trees. Mrs Obama explained the reason why they used Bo repeatedly is because it was an easy theme for young visitors to catch on to during their tours and they can be given the task of spotting Bo in each of the rooms. He's got a friend: The little boy sitting next to Michelle made sure to stroke the dog throughout . He also kept up the tradition- started by President Bush's pet Barney- of doing a video tour of the decorations throughout the White House that is then posted online for people to view in case they are not among the lucky thousands who tour it in person. This is definitely not the first year that the holiday spotlight turned to Bo, as he has been the sole subject of each of the first family's Christmas cards since Barack took office in 2009.","Both the president and his wife spoke of .

"By . Jenny Hope . UPDATED: . 21:16 EST, 28 December 2011 . A drug can slow down the progress of ovarian cancer – known as the’ silent killer’ – by up to six months, claim researchers. A new trial of 1,500 women shows Avastin delays the advance of the disease by an average of two months, compared with standard chemotherapy. But women with the most aggressive disease got the biggest benefit, with the disease stalled for almost six months. About 4,400 women die each year from the disease, which claims the lives of over 85 per cent of patients if found at a late stage . Avastin, also known as bevacizumab, is already widely used in patients with colon cancer, and doctors believe it will become a standard treatment for ovarian cancer. Chief investigator Dr Tim Perren, Consultant Oncologist from St James’s Institute of Oncology, St James’s University Hospital, Leeds and Honorary Senior Lecturer at the University of Leeds, said: ‘These results are potentially very encouraging particularly for women with advanced ovarian cancer. ‘Bevacizumab is the first new drug for 15 years to show an advantage over existing treatments for women with this disease. ‘These results are however preliminary and will not be fully confirmed until early 2013.’ Ovarian cancer, which affects almost 7,000 women a year, is dubbed the ‘silent killer’ because symptoms are often diagnosed too late. About 4,400 women die each year from the disease, which claims the lives of over 85 per cent of patients if found at a late stage when it has spread to other parts of the body. There has been little improvement in overall survival rates since the introduction of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel 15 years ago. Latest findings from an international trial sponsored by the UK Medical Research Council are published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The trial followed 1.528 ovarian . cancer patients who were randomly allocated to receive either standard . chemotherapy, or a combination of standard treatment and Avastin, . following surgery to remove their tumour. The researchers recorded the time taken for the disease to return, measured by CT scan. International trials show Avastin gives women in the late stages of ovarian cancer an extra six months of life . The interim results of the trial, reported after 28 months of follow-up, show an overall slowing down of disease progression by around two months. The results suggest it may improve overall survival in women, and the biggest effect on delaying the disease was found in women with an aggressive form of the disease – by almost six months. Professor Max Parmar, director of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit and co-author of the study, said ‘This suggests that bevacizumab could be considered as a treatment for women with an advanced form of the disease, or whose cancer has come back after chemotherapy treatment. ‘However, the decision on whether to include the drug routinely should be delayed until we have further evidence on its impact on overall survival.’ Avastin is a ‘targeted’ cancer therapy that works by blocking the development of new blood vessels and interfering with the tumour’s ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body. Combining the drug with chemotherapy has been shown to improve the effectiveness of treatment in several other forms of the disease including lung, kidney and colorectal cancers, although it has proved to be less effective than hoped in breast cancer. Annwen Jones, chief executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said ‘It is very exciting and positive news for women living with ovarian cancer in the UK. It is the first glimmer of hope that there are significant advancements in treatments for ovarian cancer on the horizon at last. ‘We said previously the real challenge was to find well-tolerated treatments that prolong the lives of women, and it seems that Avastin is now a significant step nearer to realising that goal.’ Roche, which manufactures the drug, has applied to the European Medicines Agency for a licence to use it to treat ovarian cancer and a decision is expected shortly. It will need to be approved by the NHS rationing body, Nice, before it is widely used but in the meantime cancer specialists can apply for funding on behalf of patients to the Cancer Drugs Fund in England.","New trial of 1,500 women shows Avastin .

Authorities investigating the death . of a Texas district attorney arrested a former justice of the peace and . charged him on Saturday with making a 'terroristic threat' after . searching his home. Eric Williams, 46, was admitted to the Kaufman County Jail early Saturday morning, jail records show. Bond was set at $1 million for the terroristic threat charge and at $1 million each for two charges of insufficient bond. Officials have not named Williams as a . suspect in the March 30 shooting deaths of District Attorney Mike . McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, or in the late January death of . assistant DA Mark Hasse, who was fatally shot as he was leaving work in . Kaufman, about 30 miles southeast of Dallas. But federal and local authorities searched Williams' home Friday as part of an investigation into the McLellands' deaths. The district attorney's office . prosecuted Williams, and he was convicted in March 2012 of burglary of a . building and theft by a public servant. Williams, who was sentenced to two months of probation, lost his justice of the peace position as a result of the conviction. Spokesmen for the FBI and the Kaufman . County Sheriff's Office confirmed Friday they were executing a search . warrant but declined to provide details. The sheriff's office said the . warrant's underlying affidavit was ordered sealed by a judge. Williams' attorney, David Sergi, . released a statement Friday saying his client 'has cooperated with law . enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations.' 'He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice,' Sergi said. Earlier this month, Williams said he . voluntarily submitted to a gun residue test and turned over his . cellphone after authorities contacted him while investigating the deaths . of the McLellands. Authorities have released little . information about the case except to say they continue to follow leads, . including possible ties to a white supremacist gang. One month before Hasse's death, the . Texas Department of Public Safety issued a warning to authorities . statewide that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas could retaliate for an . October indictment that targeted some of its leaders. McLelland's office . was involved in that investigation. Newly obtained surveillance footage shows Kaufman County, Texas, district attorney Mike McLelland shopping for guns only hours before he was assassinated. The footage was captured by security cameras at a Forney, Texas, gun shop at about 1:30 p.m last Friday. The next day, both McLelland and his wife Cynthia were found murdered in their house. Scroll down for video . Security footage captures the DA going to look at guns only a day before he and his wife, Cynthia, were found dead . McLelland often carried a gun but was interested in weapons for his staff . Store owner O'Neill Kidwill said McLelland often stopped in to chat and look at guns . Store owner O'Neill Kidwill told CBS News McLelland was more worried about his coworker's safety than his own. 'I was showing him one of the revolvers,' Kidwill said. 'I asked him if he was ever in fear of his life, he said no. He was more worried about his coworkers.' Precautions: Assistant DA Mark Hasse was shot dead on January 31 . McLelland asked for recommendations for guns to give his employees, who were terrified by the January murder of assistant district attorney Mark Hasse. McLelland himself seemed calm. 'He . didn't seem like anything was going to happen to him. He was . invincible. He was happy,' Kidwill said. 'Everything was good in his . world.' The men talked for about 30 minutes as McLelland shopped. Kidwill said he recommended 38-caliber revolvers and bulletproof vests for his staff. He also recommended that McLelland wear a vest himself. However after CBS released its interview, Kidwill took to Facebook to clarify that McLelland was a regular in the gun shop and was not there out of fear. 'Mike came in once or twice a week to be around other gun . enthusiast/hobbyists because that’s what he was, and to be around good . friends to swap war stories and just talk,' Kidwill wrote. 'He never talked about what he . knew about his assistants murder. He was confident the killer would . face justice. And we very much hope they do.I have also been misquoted . by saying mike took to carrying his 38 after marks murder. Truth is mike . has always carried his gun, it’s his job.' Kidwill was one of hundreds who attended the McLellands' service, along with dozens of law enforcement officers and . public officials, including Texas Governor Rick Perry. According to CNN, an affidavit on Thursday revealed further details of the investigations into the couple's deaths. Friends . reportedly found the bodies of the DA and his wife after going to their . home on Saturday evening, having not heard from them in almost 24 . hours. They were found with multiple gunshot wounds. Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow on Saturday . Police . have requested phone records for the McLellands for the last two months . to see if more can be discovered about the days leading up to the fatal . attack. At their funeral service on Thursday, Mr and Mrs McLelland shared a single, flag-draped casket inside the suburban church. McLelland had addressed many of the . same people two months earlier, after the slaying of Mark Hasse, one of . his prosecutors. Hasse was gunned down near the Kaufman County . courthouse while going to work. The deaths are feared to be planned attacks by violent white supremacist gang, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas. McLelland . was pivotal in the prosecution of a senior member of the Aryan . Brotherhood of Texas last year who received two life terms following a . shoot out. No arrests have been made in either case. The reward for information leading to a conviction has been doubled to $200,000. Days after the bodies were discovered, assistant DA Jay Hileman sent a short email to the defense team today saying that he was stepping down for security reasons. Honored: An image of Kaufman County DA Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia is unveiled beside their coffin at a memorial service in Mesquite, Texas . He is being replaced by another .

Call to action: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell addresses the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual policy conference at the Washington Convention Center . Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said the U.S. should use overwhelming military force against Iran if American intelligence shows that Tehran has decided to build a nuclear weapon, or it has started to enrich uranium to weapons-grade level.Senator McConnell, of Kentucky, said President Barack Obama's repeated pronouncement that the administration keeps 'all options on the table' is a talking point, not a policy, and the U.S. needed a straightforward deliberate plan that would force Tehran to negotiate to preserve its survival. Senator McConnell was making the case for his proposal in a speech to the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee, shortly before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to address the gathering. 'If Iran, at any time, begins to enrich uranium to weapons-grade level, or decides to go forward with a weapons program, then the United States will use overwhelming force to end that programme,' McConnell said. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and . National Intelligence Director James Clapper told Congress last month . that Tehran has not made a decision on whether to proceed with . development of an atomic bomb amid growing fears of its disputed nuclear . weapons program and the possibility of an Israeli attack that could . lead to a Mideast conflagration. Prior to private talks with Mr Netanyahu . yesterday, Mr Obama said the U.S. and Israel agree that diplomacy . is the best way to resolve the crisis. But Mr Netanyahu also said Israel . must remain 'the master of its fate.' Senator McConnell said that if U.S. intelligence, at any time, informs Congress that Iran has begun to . enrich uranium to weapons-grade standards or decided to develop a . nuclear weapon, he would consult with the President and the joint . congressional leadership on legislation authorising the use of American . military force. This satellite image shows a view of facilities within Parchin in Iran which were said to be possibly involved in nuclear weapons research . US President Barack Obama with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office . Congress has not voted on such a . resolution since October 2002 when it gave President George W. Bush the . authority to use military force against Iraq. Republicans and Democrats . on Capitol Hill have been unified in pushing hard for sanctions against . Tehran, including the latest round of penalties targeting Iran's Central . Bank, but a vote on using military force would test a war-weary . Congress and any bipartisanship. McConnell said the authorization for . U.S. military against Iran would make clear that if Iran or its proxies . retaliate against the United States or its interests, they would face an . overwhelming response. Mr Netanyahu handed President Obama a gift on Monday that spoke volumes about Israel’s tensions with Iran - an ancient Hebrew tome about a Persian plot to annihilate Jews. The Scroll Of Esther is a tale of palace intrigue, featuring a Jewish beauty who charms a Persian king into foiling an evil adviser’s genocidal plans for her people some 2,500 years ago.

The 26-year-old, from London, made the bizarre bet at odds of 5,000-1 . after hearing of the Mayan Prophecy that the world would be destroyed, or changed, today at 11.11am (GMT). Wager: Martin Muller was set to make £50,000 after placing a £10 bet with Paddy Power that the world was going to end today - at odds of 5,000-1 . He made the bet with friend Rob Moss after telling him there was more chance of the world ending than his bicycle courier business being a success. Mr Muller said: 'I told Rob there was more chance of the world ending than his company getting off the ground. 'So I thought as a joke I'd make the bet, I'd heard of the Mayan prophecy about December 21 being the apocalypse so thought what have I got to lose?' Bet: The bicycle courier, 26, has admitted that spending his winnings would have been difficult if the 'Mayan Prophecy' which predicts the apocalypse, had come true today .

Today marks the same number of days once again, and believers feared the reset of the calender will mean the end of the world. However, experts say that it is unclear whether the Maya themselves actually agreed on this. The prediction nevertheless . caused panic among believers, with thousands of people . stockpiling food and even creating special shelters to survive the Earth's 'destruction.' So many people . called NASA to vent their anxieties that the US space agency set up a . special website to help dispel the 'myth,' according to the Daily Star.

It's a question that divides families and friends, men from women and North from South: Do you prefer brown sauce, red sauce... or no sauce at all? Well, it seems that we like tomato ketchup the best. In a survey, 50 per cent said they prefer ketchup overall, with 34 per cent voting for brown and the other 16 per cent undecided or preferring no sauce. Ketchup is king: Red sauce has been voted the best overall, beating its brown rival into second place in a survey commissioned by website Ask Jeeves . But things change when it comes to bacon sandwiches. Some 42 per cent choose brown against 32 per cent for red, and 26 per cent who like neither. Ketchup gets the vote from women, adults aged 44 and under, and those living in London, the South East and the South West. It is also the overwhelming choice as an accompaniment to chips – 60 per cent against 16 per cent – with only the Scots demanding brown. Men say brown is best on sausages but women prefer ketchup.  Older Britons are more likely to ask for brown sauce, particularly if they are men, as are people in the North West and Wales. Hearty victory: When it comes to bacon sandwiches, however, more people choose brown sauce over ketchup . Bacon sandwich – brown 42 per cent, red 32 per cent, neither 26 per cent; . Chips – brown 16 per cent, red 60 per cent, neither 24 per cent; . Sausages – brown 45 per cent, red 35 per cent, neither 20 per cent; . Eggs (fried or scrambled) – brown 21 per cent, red 30 per cent, neither 49 per cent; . Toasted cheese sandwich – brown 28 per cent, red 17 per cent, neither 55 per cent. Overall – brown 34 per cent, red 50 per cent, neither 16 per cent . The website Ask Jeeves decided to commission the survey of 1,000 adults after receiving frequent questions about which sauce was best with each food. But a spokesman for Ask Jeeves admitted: ‘Somehow, I don’t think this will settle the argument once and for all.’ While it is all a question of taste, it is clear that some habits have formed whether it is by region, gender or age. Older Britons are more likely to ask for brown sauce, as those in areas like the North West and Wales for instance. London and the south east has a clear preference for red while other regions vary a lot more from food to food, said Ask Jeeves. Men are more likely than women to demand brown on most foods, except chips, and brown is also more popular among older generations in general but men in particular. A spokeswoman for Ask Jeeves said: 'The results of the poll confirms that the great issue of red or brown continues to split the nation. 'Maybe brown is more an acquired taste, it certainly seems to get more popular the older you get. 'Red appears more popular overall but somehow I don’t think this will settle the argument once and for all.'","Half prefer red sauce to brown overall, says survey .

Back in 1986, a producer friend at the BBC suggested that a book I had written, The English Woman’s Wardrobe, would make a good documentary film. The book was not about fashion, but about women’s feelings about their clothes. Princess Margaret was the star of the printed version: we wanted Mrs Thatcher to take that role in the film. Amazingly, she agreed. With curiously little difficulty, a visit to 10  Downing Street was arranged. We would be allowed half an hour talking to Mrs Thatcher in her sitting room at the top of the house. It was hoped that I would be able to persuade her to show us a few of her favourite clothes. Some days before the interview, my producer friend, Ruth Jackson received a command from on high in the BBC. There was a single question they were adamant I should put to the Prime Minister: where did she get her knickers? Not quite able to believe they should require me to do something so impolite, I said I refused to ask that. Me and my wardrobe: Margaret Thatcher spoke about her style in an interview with the BBC in 1986 . In that case, came the reply, my producer would have to take over the interview. I was outraged. Even as we arrived at Downing Street, I still had not decided what to do. I did not want the interview to be snatched away, but felt the rude question was impossible to ask. A security man, unsure of the way, led us upstairs, and down, and up, trying to pretend he and his band of followers weren’t lost. Eventually, we reached the top floor. It was flung open by the Prime Minister. She greeted us with extraordinary enthusiasm. It was only later that we heard that, for her, it was the sixth interview of the day. She led us into the sitting room. There, some 20 different garments were hanging before us on a long clothes rack. She had abandoned her lunch break to heave them from her bedroom into the sitting room. Never could she have imagined how helpful she had been: now, she and I could saunter along the line, stop at each dress or suit, and I would ask about its history. Charmed: Angela Huth found the former PM to be agreeable and helpful . In those days, filming on location was made difficult by the short time of each magazine (length of film) in the camera — ten minutes. Towards the end of each magazine a clunking, warning noise could be heard. What seemed like seconds into the first part of the interview, the juddering sound could be heard, and we’d hardly started. Only 20 minutes to go... Mrs Thatcher remembered the history of everything on the rack, and described each one with merry recall. She pointed to a severe beige suit. ‘This we wore on a visit to the Polaris missile,’ she explained, with a touch of nostalgia. The ‘we’ she referred to meant, I think, she and her dressmaker. Most of the clothes were made for her by this lady, and chiefly designed by the Prime Minister herself. ‘I invented this skirt,’ she said, and swished a long evening dress down from the rack. One side of the skirt was slashed to reveal a coloured petticoat beneath it. ‘It’s one of my favourites. I’ve noticed some designers have begun to copy the idea.’ I observed that on the whole she chose dark colours. ‘Yes: that’s what Denis says. He likes a bright colour, so I had this made.’ She held up another dress — this one of dazzling flamingo pink. Clunk, clunk went the camera. Twenty minutes gone now, and no opening for the dreaded knicker question. She explained that she rarely bought clothes from designers. What she enjoyed, she said, in the name of economy, was finding ‘the end of a roll’ of material. Dress sense . Mrs Thatcher summed up her style as 'never flashy, just appropriate' However, she did love Caroline . Charles clothes. I cheekily pointed out that the jacket I was wearing . was by Caroline Charles. I had chosen it on purpose: it led to further . bonding. I asked her why there were two . identical dresses. ‘Well, you see, we needed a whole roll of stuff for . one dress, but there was just enough for a second one, so naturally we . used that, too. I always like to use up the end of a roll.’ Clunk, clunk went the camera, and we were only half way down the rack. Mrs T had done her first interview that morning at 6am. It was completely reasonable of her to afford us half an hour, but two hours had gone by. And still no opening for the knicker question. I was beginning to panic. But she carried on cheerfully, flicking through some dresses that President Reagan had liked. Then she came to a dull-looking navy blazer. ‘Marks & Spencer’, she said. Pretty in pink: The Baroness often wore dark colours but had some colourful clothes made on husband Denis' request . The dreaded clunking began. Inspiration suddenly came. ‘Do you get a lot of things from M&S?’ ‘Well, they’re very kind. They open a store at eight in the morning for me.’ ‘And do you get your underwear there, like everyone else?’ ‘Yes.’ End of film, and the BBC had its answer. Underwear was surely less offensive than knickers. Palpable relief. We had spent three hours with the Prime Minister, so happily engrossed that, apparently, she had not noticed the passing of time. I liked to think it was an agreeable break from politics for her. She began to return the clothes to her bedroom, and made tea for everyone. Her warmth, her exuberance and her enjoyment of an unusual interview were surprising and unforgettable. She was extraordinary.","Interview took place at Downing Street when Thatcher was in power .

Authorities are investigating an explosive device addressed to Arizona's Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed 'toughest sheriff in America' known for his strict treatment of jail inmates and cracking down on illegal immigration. The device intercepted in Flagstaff late Thursday was in a package addressed to Arpaio at his downtown Phoenix office, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. It appeared suspicious, so it was X-rayed and the device was detected. A bomb squad team neutralized the explosive, the statement said. Scroll down for video . Law officers in Arizona have intercepted an explosive device that was earmarked for Arizona Sherriff Joe Arpaio . Postal Inspector Patricia Armstrong said investigators were examining debris from the package. 'We don't know if it was an actual device of some sort,' she said. Armstrong said authorities were alerted by a 'very astute' carrier who observed 'something suspicious' about the package when the carrier emptied a collection box in the Flagstaff area. Flagstaff is about 140 miles north of Phoenix. Armstrong didn't elaborate, but Tom Mangan, a spokesman in Phoenix for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said initial reports indicated that the package was a box that may have been damaged in transit and leaked gunpowder. Arpaio said the mailing of an explosive device addressed to him comes with his line of work. He cited the recent killings of a West Virginia sheriff, Colorado's corrections director and two prosecutors in Texas. 'That's the nature of the business,' he said. 'I'm getting many threats. This isn't the first time.' Intercepted: The device intercepted in Flagstaff late Thursday was in a package addressed to Arpaio at his downtown Phoenix office, . Following the killing of a West Virginia sheriff last week, Arpaio said elected law enforcement officials across the nation seem to be targeted. Numerous threats against Arpaio, a hero to many conservatives on immigration, prompted the need for a security detail for the lawman also known for dressing jail inmates in pink underwear and making them sleep in tents in the heat of the Arizona desert. A campaign to recall Arpaio began just weeks after he started his sixth term in January. Critics contend Arpaio should be ousted because his office failed to adequately investigate more than 400 sex-crimes cases, allegedly racially profiled Latinos in its trademark immigration patrols and has cost the county $25 million in legal settlements over treatment in county jails. Arpaio has denied that his deputies racially profiled Latinos in traffic patrols targeting illegal immigration. His office has moved to clear up the sex-crime cases and moved to prevent the problem from happening again, he said.","Authorities intercepted the device, which was in a package addressed to Arizona's Sheriff Joe Arpaio .

Speech: David Cameron will make a pledge this month to wrestle more powers back from Brussels . 'The crisis is a long way from being beaten,' Mrs Merkel said on German television last night. 'Internationally, more needs to be done in order to exercise control . over the financial markets. The world has not sufficiently learnt the . lessons of the devastating 2008 financial crisis. Never again can we . allow irresponsibility like back then to happen. In a social market . economy, the state is the guardian of order — and that is something . people should be able to count on.' Germany will have a general election in September and Mrs Merkel wants to win a third term in the Bundeskanzleramt - the German chancellery. Her relationship with David Cameron is fragile and the Prime Minister is preparing a keynote speech this month where he will demand that more powers are transferred from Brussels back to London. Financial services, based mainly in the City, make up 10 per cent of the UK economy and Mr Cameron will fight tooth and nail to protect it. But German has already signed up to a new banking transaction tax being touted by France, however, the UK can opt out. Even though Merkel's conservative party holds a commanding 10-point lead in opinion polls over the Social Democrats (SPD), the centre-left opposition SPD and their Greens allies have a chance of taking power because Merkel's coalition allies, the Free Democrats (FDP) have slumped badly and may not win seats. The U.S. ambassador to NATO has called on the UK and Europe to up its defence spending as it cannot rely on America any longer. Ivo Daalder says cash saved after 2014 when all NATO troops leave Afghanistan must be pumped back into military budgets. He said that the U.S. will be focussing its money elsewhere - particularly in Asia and China. 'If we don't start soon in investing in those capabilities then the gap between the US and the rest is going to grow. If we have problems, they will be even worse,' he said. The MoD in Britain is privately urging David Cameron to withdraw from Afghanistan early to save more money. But America says NATO members should put the cash into arms. But political analysts believe Merkel still has the most options to form a government after the vote. She could lead a right-left grand coalition with the SPD as she did from 2005 to 2009 or a coalition with the pro-environment Greens party. In what is viewed as a speech that will kick-start the election race, Merkel urged Germans to be more patient even though the euro zone crisis has already dragged on for three years. She drew a line linking German prosperity to a prosperous European Union. 'For our prosperity and our solidarity we need to strike the right balance,' Merkel said. 'The European sovereign debt crisis shows how important this balance is. 'The reforms that we've introduced are beginning to have an impact,' she said. 'Nevertheless we need to have further continued patience. The crisis is far from over.' But in face of slowing economic growth, Merkel also warned that conditions could be more difficult in 2013 than in 2012. 'I know that many people are naturally concerned going into the new year,' she said. 'And the economic environment will not in fact be easier but rather more difficult next year. But we shouldn't let that get us down; rather it should spur us on.'","German Chancellor demands more strict controls imposed on Europe's biggest financial markets .

The Chinese government launched a new assault on free speech online today by requiring all internet users to register their real names. The new rule comes in the wake of the runaway success of Weibo, a micro-blogging service similar to Twitter which has exposed corruption and other abuses of official power. The country's rubber-stamp legislature approved the controversial measures at the closing meeting of a five-day session. Crackdown: Chinese web users will be forced to register their real names . Real-name registration will end the potential of the web to be a freewheeling forum to complain anonymously about the Chinese government. The government claims the latest regulation is aimed at protecting web surfers' personal information and cracking down on abuses such as junk email. The measure will 'ensure internet information security, safeguard the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal entities or other organisations and safeguard national security and social public interests,' according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The measure would require service providers to ask users to provide their real names and other identifying information if they want to post information publicly or sign up for access to the internet and telephone services, Xinhua said. Controversial: Chinese web users have flocked to Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog, to express their opinions anonymously . Weibo users quickly reacted with fury to the changes. 'So now they are getting Weibo to help in keeping records and reporting it to authorities. Is this the freedom of expression we are promised in the constitution?', complained one user. 'We should resolutely oppose such a covert means to interfere with Internet freedom,' wrote another. The new regulations will enable officials to build up a profile of every web user's online activity, from shopping to social networking - and if they use a mobile phone to access the internet, the authorities might even be able to track their physical location. China expert Bill Bishop tweeted that the rules would have a 'chilling effect', but added: 'There is already no anonymity online in china, especially if you use a mobile device on services like Weibo. Government can already find you.' Decision: The ruling was made by the Chinese rubber-stamp legislature . The new restrictions could also prevent users from accessing Western websites which are banned inside China, such as Facebook, Twitter, Bloomberg and the New York Times. It is currently possible to use a virtual private network (VPN) to circumvent the official firewall, but in recent weeks such services have become increasingly difficult to access. And now that officials will be able to track when web users are deploying VPNs, it could be even harder for Chinese residents to connect to the outside world. A survey earlier this year indicated that three quarters of companies in the country said the unpredictability of internet regulations made it harder to do business. Beijing promotes internet use for . business and education, but bans material deemed subversive or obscene . and blocks access to many websites. The main ruling party newspaper, People's Daily, has called in recent weeks for tighter internet controls, saying rumours spread online have harmed the public. In one case, it said stories about a chemical plant explosion resulted in the deaths of four people in a car accident as they fled the area. Until recently, web surfers could post comments online or on microblog services without leaving their names, giving ordinary Chinese a unique opportunity to express themselves to a public audience in a society where newspapers, television and other media are state-controlled. The Internet also has given the public a unique opportunity to publicise accusations of official misconduct. A local party official in China's southwest was fired in November after scenes from a videotape of him having sex with a young woman spread quickly on the internet.","New rules follow use of popular microblogs to expose official corruption .

When Neil and Fran Davies booked a professional photography session, they had hoped to get treasured family snaps of their son Danny at just a few weeks old. They never imagined it would show up tell-tale signs that he was seriously ill. Danny had appeared the picture of health when he was born and no-one was too worried that he looked slightly purple - assuming he was simply a bit bruised by his arrival. Danny Davies had appeared the picture of health when he was born and no-one was worried that he looked slightly purple - assuming he was simply a bit bruised by his arrival . But when the photos were developed, his parents noticed the purple blotches on Danny's skin had got worse and his hands and feet looked almost blue. This sparked a chain of events that ended in life-saving treatment at Southampton General Hospital, where Danny was diagnosed with the rare heart defect pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD). This is a very rare congenital malformation of the heart where the pulmonary valve fails to develop properly, obstructing the flow of blood from the heart to the lungs. This is coupled with a defect in the lower chamber walls dividing the left and right-hand side. Two days after the photo session, . Mrs Davies mentioned her concerns about the blotches to a community . nurse who sent them to their GP to get Danny's oxygen levels checked. Unfortunately, the doctor's surgery . had only an adult's machine available so when Danny's oxygen levels were . reading at 50 per cent (rather than the expected 97 per cent) - it was . assumed it was because it wasn't a children's device. But when the photos were developed, his parents noticed the purple blotches on his skin had got worse and his hands and feet looked almost blue - and he was diagnosed with a rare heart disorder . To be on the safe side, Danny was then sent to St Richard's Hospital in Chichester so a proper test could be performed. After two hours of trying to get a normal reading, he was sent to the paediatric cardiac centre at Southampton General Hospital. Mrs Davies, 23, from Felpham near . Bognor Regis in West Sussex, said: 'At this point, we were remarkably . calm and still didn't think it was that serious. 'The . next thing we knew we were ushered through to a private room and told . Danny had a very rare congenital heart condition and was critically ill. He was struggling to get oxygen around his body and we were told the . next 24 hours were critical. 'We couldn't quite believe how . quickly he'd deteriorated: we went from thinking our son was a healthy . newborn to being told his life was in danger within the space of a few . hours. 'In fact, we were told that if we'd . taken 15 minutes longer to get to Southampton, Danny might not have made . it - it was almost unbelievable.' Within two hours of arriving, Danny was in theatre as doctors tried to deal with the rare heart condition. The condition had affected Danny's ability to get oxygenated blood around his body, which is crucial for survival. By the time he was diagnosed, his condition was so severe that arriving 15 minutes later at the hospital could have killed him. Pictured here today, aged two . The cause of PA-VSD is unknown and it accounts for only around three per cent  of congenital heart problems. Danny . remained in theatre for more than 10 hours as consultant cardiac . surgeons Nicola Viola and Markku Kaarne struggled to stabilise him. It was a nail-biting time for full-time mother Mrs Davies and Mr Davies, 22, a mechanic. 'The doctors came through to us to say the next 24 hours were critical and that Danny's life was at risk,' said Mrs Davies. 'We . were told that he would need to go on an ECMO machine when he came out . of theatre, which would keep him alive in what was a desperate . situation.' Extracorporeal . membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides both cardiac and respiratory . support. Blood is oxygenated outside the body and returned to allow the . heart and lungs time to rest and recover while maintaining a good blood supply to the brain and other organs in the body. This technique is a method of life support and is used only when all other options have been exhausted. Danny, here with father Neil and mother Fran, may need a lung and heart transplant in the future . One of the nurses caring for Danny, Pam Modelly, explained: 'These were some of the worst nights the team had ever experienced as his deterioration was so unexpected. He came in looking like a healthy little boy and went downhill so quickly. ECMO really was the last resort and gave us time to allow Danny's body to recover.' After seven days Danny came off the machine but remained in hospital for another four months, undergoing further surgery to reconstruct his heart and help it work more efficiently. Finally, in October 2010, Danny was allowed to return home. He is now two, has a little sister called Sky and has a new home more suited to his care. But he has now undergone a further 12 procedures and will need to come to the cardiac ward at Southampton throughout his life. He has also been referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London to see if further treatment, including the possibility of a heart and lung transplant, will help him. 'We realise what Danny has isn't curable but Southampton is doing all it can to give him the best life they can, and we're so pleased to have them,' Mrs Davies said. 'We expect to have many more visits to the hospital but we know we are in safe hands and Danny is given the best care we could hope for.' Kevin Roman, consultant in paediatric cardiology, said: 'Danny is one of the most complex patients we have ever seen and has been through an incredible journey in his short life. 'He's such a fighter and has quite a fan base here. We will continue to do everything we can for Danny and give him the best outlook in the coming years.'","Danny Davies looked slightly purple when he was born, but doctors assumed he was simply bruised by his arrival .

Witnesses claimed that during the almost 10 hour flight he was repeatedly shouting, swearing and stumbling around, while spitting at those who tried to calm him. He then allegedly assaulted a senior member of the cabin crew by pushing him into the galley and demanding to know why he was not allowed any more alcohol. 31-year-old Lesley Lewis was sat close to Bradley on the long flight. ‘At one stage I could see him holding a broken glass ready to attack the crew and talking to himself,’ she told The Sun. ‘He was saying to people around him “I’ll stab the pilots if they want”. I and other passengers were petrified.’ British Airways today told MailOnline they made sure police were waiting for him at the gate when they landed at terminal five on Saturday.

"By . Catherine Ostler . PUBLISHED: . 19:30 EST, 12 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:36 EST, 13 April 2013 . The Countess of Wemyss and March has tried so many drugs - including cannabis, magic mushrooms and LSD - that she says when it comes to her research, 'I have always considered myself my own best laboratory' She has been known to wander around her home in floaty clothes with a tropical bird — possibly a parakeet — sitting on her shoulder. Perhaps such eccentricity is not surprising since the Countess of Wemyss and March is best known for her belief in the health benefits of magic mushrooms and trepanning (drilling a hole in one’s head to ‘expand the consciousness’). Preferring to call herself plain Amanda Feilding, she lives in Beckley Park, a hunting lodge built in the time of Henry VIII which was used as a backdrop in a Harry Potter film. It is her Oxfordshire hereditary seat, from which she runs the Beckley Foundation, an outfit she set up in 1998 to campaign for the legalisation of drugs and to help research their potential beneficial effects for medicine. She has tried so many drugs — including cannabis, magic mushrooms and LSD — that she says when it comes to her research, ‘I have always considered myself my own best laboratory’. Yet one visitor warns that her ‘research’ has taken its toll, saying: ‘Though articulate, she is not a particularly good advert for drug use because she looks so fragile and shakes a lot.’ Beckley Park has nevertheless become a second home to a number of high-profile scientists who are on the committee of Amanda’s foundation. The most prominent is Professor David Nutt, who was sacked as the Government’s chief drug tsar in 2009 when he claimed that Ecstasy was less dangerous than horse riding. Today, together with the countess, he runs joint-research programmes between Imperial College London and the Beckley Foundation. Last week, it emerged that, as president of the British Neuroscience Association, Nutt has been given £550,000 of public money by the Medical Research Council for a project backed by the Beckley Foundation to investigate whether the hallucinogenic compound in magic mushrooms — psilocybin — might be used to treat depression. The only obstacle standing in the way of the trial, says Nutt, is that he’s having trouble getting hold of the restricted compound. But with the uniquely determined Lady Wemyss — predictably nicknamed Lady Mindbender — behind him, this will surely be overcome. This year, the Countess of Wemyss turned 70. But neither age nor her husband the Earl of Wemyss’s vast inheritance has dimmed the zeal of this queen of Haute Bohemia on the question of drugs. Despite her husband’s fortune — not to mention his Jacobean stately in Gloucestershire, the 44,000 acres in Scotland and the £100 million art collection — Amanda has sought independent funding for her research and claims to have little money to throw at the Foundation herself. Among those on the countess's committee which campaigns for the legalisation of drugs is Professor David Nutt (above). He was sacked as the Government's chief drug tsar in 2009 when he claimed that Ecstasy was less dangerous than horse riding . But there is no question about her husband’s devotion to her and her eccentricities. Indeed, shortly after their marriage, he allowed himself to undergo a procedure she espoused known as ‘trepanning’. But more of that later. Lady Wemyss’s extreme interest in exploring the mind seems to have started in childhood. Eccentricity seems to run in the family. Amanda’s grandmother Cloclo, a part-German, part-American artist who was brought up in Italy wore clothes made of hessian and a bowler hat — which was on her head when she died. The next generation was no less strange. Amanda’s father, an art and antiques-loving country squire called Basil, married his own cousin, Peggy. Together, they inherited Beckley from his parents. And into this rose pink home in January 1943, Amanda was born. Her godfather was Bertie Moore, her father’s best friend at Oxford, who became a celebrated Buddhist monk in Ceylon. Although she was raised a Roman Catholic, Amanda became interested in spiritualism under his unorthodox influence. Last week, it emerged that, as president of the British Neuroscience Association, Nutt has been given £550,000 of public money by the Medical Research Council for a project backed by the Beckley Foundation to investigate whether the hallucinogenic compound in magic mushrooms - psilocybin - might be used to treat depression . In 1966, after dropping out of both her convent school and Oxford, where she had studied comparative religion, she fell for a handsome Dutch scientist called Bart Huges — who had been refused his medical degree after openly advocating the use of cannabis. It was Huges who introduced her to trepanning, a procedure that has been practised since the Stone Age. Huges was obsessed by a crackpot theory dubbed ‘Homo Sapiens Correctus’. This held that ever since man stood on two legs, he had not been getting enough blood to his brain. What modern man needed was a hole in the head to improve blood flow. Huges called this hole ‘a third eye’ and claimed it to be the oldest form of surgery. In 1965, he drilled a hole into his own skull — and within a few weeks he was in a Dutch lunatic asylum. Huges had a friend — Old Etonian and Oxford graduate, Joe Mellen — who also swore by trepanning, and he became Amanda’s next lover, as well as father of her two sons Rock and Cosmo. Before long, the couple were performing their own trepanning experiments. Mellen decided to start on his own skull first, with Amanda assisting him. Perhaps inevitably, the experiment went wrong and she had to take him to hospital. Undaunted, he made another attempt after he had recovered, and pronounced it so successful that he wrote a book about it — Bore Hole. His testimony convinced Amanda that she must do it to herself. The countess married Jamie Neidpath (above), six years her junior and heir to the earldom of Wemyss and March. They wed in Egypt, at sunset, in the shade of the Southern Shining pyramid . It was on a Sunday afternoon in December 1970 that the 27-year-old art student sat in front a mirror in her Chelsea flat, shaved her hairline, put on a floral shower cup to keep the rest of her hair back — and injected herself with local anaesthetic. She then peeled back a patch of skin with a scalpel, held a dentist’s drill to the bone above her forehead and pushed its teeth into her skull. She continued drilling until she had got through the bone, and stopped when she reached the ‘dura mater’ — the thin membrane between the bone and the brain itself. At this point, a geyser of blood shot out of the opening. Then she bandaged her head and mopped up the blood and went to a party in the evening. She even set up a camera for a movie of the operation, a clip of which can now be seen on the internet. It is not for the faint of heart. In the following years she twice stood for Parliament in Chelsea, on a ticket campaigning for trepanning to be available on the NHS. Second time round, 139 people actually voted for her. She and Mellen were together for 28 years, but split up in the early Nineties. Before long, however, she had met and married Jamie Neidpath, six years her junior and heir to the earldom of Wemyss and March. They wed in Egypt, at sunset, in the shade of the Southern Shining pyramid. He too was seduced by his wife’s obsession with trepanning. In Cairo, he found a surgeon who drilled a hole in his head for $2,000, which he found ‘highly beneficial’. Wemyss, an Oxford don who once taught Bill Clinton, was known for hosting amazing parties at Stanway, his Jacobean stately home in Gloucestershire, which made boho-aristo groupies like Mick Jagger go weak at the knees. There were plenty with his first wife Catherine Guinness and he continued the pattern with his new countess. The most memorable of these parties took place last year when Neidpath’s bombshell daughter Mary Charteris, married a pop musician called Robbie Furze. The event, described as ‘the maddest wedding of the year’, was attended by Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, and the supermodel Delevingne sisters. The bride wore a very revealing dress; the ring bearer was a dog. Yet despite this decadence, since setting up her foundation she has travelled the world enlisting the support of presidents, made depositions to the House of Lords, and collected big-name scientists around her. Even proof that this theory was bunkum hasn’t put Amanda or her circle off — hence the £550,000 grant to investigate magic mushrooms. It is clear, too, that her interest in drugs has been handed down the generations. In 2011, Amanda’s younger son Cosmo, 28, made a film, Breaking The Taboo, which was financed by Sam Branson, son of Richard, and argues that criminalisation of drugs isn’t working. Nor was the family’s fervent belief in the legalisation of drugs dented by a tragic reminder of the dangers of drugs that came in 2004. Robert Hesketh, who Catherine Guinness had married after her divorce from Lord Neidpath, died at the age of 48, with a cocktail of alcohol, heroin and cocaine in his blood. Nothing, not even tragedy, could put off the Countess of Wemyss from espousing the benefits of illegal substances and mind-bending mushrooms.","Countess of Wemyss and March - aka 'Lady Mindbender' - is best known for her belief in the health benefits of magic mushrooms .

'We were getting along fine,' Pope said in the interview Thursday, 'then she mentioned, in early January, getting this kidnap and ransom policy on my son.' Pope believes the suggestion was a veiled threat against her grandchild. Mrs. Pope says her son asked her for the . insurance - adding that it is nothing more than her other children and . grandchildren already carry. Smear campaign? On Good Morning America Thursday, Paul Pope stoked the flames of the feud, claiming his mother only wants to 'villianize' him . Meanwhile, Lois Pope filed a . restraining order last week alleging that her son began stalking her . after she refused to give him all the money he demands.

After National Enquirer founder Generoso Pope died in 1989, Lois received $200 million, while Paul Pope inherited $20 million. The rest of the $400 million the tabloid sold for was divided among Mr Pope's four other siblings. Mrs. Pope also claims her son has repeatedly asked her for money, even after she gave him $8 million and a yacht in recent years. 'This is devastating to me. I am positively distraught.

A two-year-old girl lost both of her feet and part of her hand after her father accidentally ran over her in a ride-on lawnmower and then dragged her the length of their driveway. The girl, named Ireland Nugent, has undergone two surgeries and is due to have two more, but her parents have spoken out saying that this accident will not stop her going forward. 'She will continue to succeed. She will do great things in her life,' her mother Nicole told reporters at a press conference. 'This will not stop Ireland.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Ireland Nugent, 2, lost both of her feet and part of an arm in the Wednesday accident . United front: After initially being treated for hysteria following the accident, Nicole and Jeremiah Nugent stood by each other during a press conference on Thursday . Police said the father, identified by police as 47-year-old Jeremiah Nugent, was going to park the mower into the garage at the family's Palm Harbor, Florida home at around 7 p.m. on Wednesday. Accident: Jeremiah Nugent, 47, was pulling into his garage to park the ride-on lawnmower when he reversed after seeing his wife wave to tell him he was going to run over something . He is said to have not noticed that his daughter had tripped behind the machine, and he only realized that something may be wrong when he saw his wife was alerting him that he was about to drive over something. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office says the man responded by putting the mower in reverse, running over his daughter. According to police, the father dragged the little girl down the driveway of their subdivision and onto the street before he realized what had happened. Once he did, Mr Nugent immediately turned off the mower, and the woman called 911. Authorities say the child's feet were severed above the ankles. Her left hand was injured but intact. She was airlifted to Tampa General Hospital with her distraught parents where she is undergoing treatment. 'She suffered from immediate amputations to both legs below the knees and partial amputation on her hand,' Palm Harbor Fire Rescue said in a media release. Too late: Police said her father swaddled her with a blanket and immediately called 911 . Horrific: A two-year-old girl lost both of her legs and part of her hand last night after her father accidentally ran over her in a ride-on lawnmower, pictured, and then dragged her the length of their drive way . Support: The family's pastor stood with them as they spoke to reporters outside of the Tampa hospital, telling how their neighbors have created a fund to pay for Ireland's prosthetic limbs . Police told ABC News that it will not be possible for the girl's limbs to be reattached, but her mother told a group of reporters on Thursday that their neighbors have banded together and begun raising funds so that the Nugents will be able to pay for prosthetic limbs for Ireland. 'Never in my life did I think this would happen to my child,' Mrs Nugent said according to NBC News. She was taken to Tampa General Hospital, and her condition was unavailable Thursday. The girl's parents were treated at the hospital for hysteria immediately after the incident, but showed a positive, united front alongside their family pastor during the press conference on Thursday.","The father, Jeremiah Nugent, started up the mower at the family's Palm Harbor, Florida, .

New hope: Actress Angelina Jolie welcomes a G8 pledge to tackle sexual violence at harm to women in war torn countries in London this afternoon . Actress Angelina Jolie joined forces with Foreign Secretary William Hague as the UK pledged to spend a further £10million on tackling sexual violence and harm to women in war zones. Jolie, who is a special envoy for the UN Human Rights Council, joined Mr Hague at a meeting of the G8 foreign ministers in London this afternoon to make the commitment. Mr Hague said the deal was necessary to 'end the treatment of rape and sexual violence as a secondary issue and to put women and women's rights front and centre in conflict resolution.' The UK's pledge will make up part of an overall £23 million package pledged by the G8 nations. Half of the money (£5 million) will come from the Foreign Office (FCO), while the other half will come from the Department for International Development (DfID). Addressing the media after the meeting at Lancaster House, Jolie welcomed the G8 pledge. She said: 'I have heard survivors of rape from Bosnia to the DR Congo say that they feel that they world simply does not care about them and who can blame them. 'For too long they have been the forgotten victims of war, responsible for none of the harm but bearing the worst of the pain. 'But today I believe their voices have been heard and that we finally have some hope to offer. 'I welcome the long overdue stand the G8 has taken and this landmark declaration.' Mr Hague said: 'We need to shrink and eradicate safe havens for those responsible for war-zone rape and this is a step towards doing that.' Scroll down for video . Promise: Ms Jolie and Foreign Secretary William Hague address the media after the G8 meeting at Lancaster House today . New deal: Mr Hague looks on as actress Jolie welcomes the UK plan to contribute £10million to the new project to tackle rape and violence against women in war zones . Funds: Half of the money (£5 million) will come from the Foreign Office (FCO), while the other half will come from the Department for International Development (DfID) Landmark: Jolie said that survivors of rape have long been the 'forgotten victims' of war and that the G8 pledge is long overdue . He said that part of the funding would go into training the military to respond to conflict sexual violence. That training will be extended to peacekeeping groups of other nations.. He added: 'This is an absolutely crucial step, since members of armed forces are often the first to come into contact with survivors and could also have an important role to play in helping to change male attitudes. 'Now that we have put war-zone rape on the international agenda, it must never slip off it again and it must be given even greater prominence. 'Ending the 17th and 18th Century slave trade was deemed impossible and it was eradicated. All smiles: Jolie and Mr Hague are pictured outside Lancaster House where G8 foreign ministers met today . 'Achieving global action against landmines, cluster munitions, climate change, was thought impossible, yet the world acts on these issues. 'Only two weeks ago we secured an international arms trade treaty, one that many people thought could never be adopted. 'And today we know the facts about sexual violence in conflict and we have the means to address it, so we must not look away or rest until the world faces up to its responsibilities to eradicate this violence.' Mr Hague and the actress, flanked by the other G8 nations foreign ministers were also joined on stage by Zainab Bangura, the Special Representative for the UN on sexual violence in conflict. Meeting of nations: Ministers gather for their first session at the Foreign Ministers G8 meeting at Lancaster House . International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Britain will not stand on the sidelines while so many are denied the chance to reach their full potential and live safe, happy lives. 'We know that girls and women are at their most vulnerable at times of conflict or humanitarian disaster but we need to know what works best to tackle the terrible, often sexual, violence they face.' The group of foreign ministers also said that they were appalled at the estimated 70,000 deaths during the two year civil war in Syria. US Secretary of State John Kerry met with Syrian opposition leaders in London yesterday to discuss ways to step up non-lethal aid to the rebels. But no mention was made of helping the rebels in a military capacity, with opinion on how to address the Syria conflict divided among the G8 nations. The ministers reaffirmed 'their commitment' to supporting a political transition in Syria and condemned the ongoing use of heavy weapons against residential areas. Warm welcome: Foreign Secretary William Hague (right) greets US Secretary of State John Kerry (left) for the G8 Foreign Ministers meeting . 'The humanitarian situation in Syria is deplorable and continues to worsen,' the communique said, urging greater humanitarian assistance and improved access to the Syrian people. Britain and France have been pushing for the European Union to lift or amend its arms embargo on Syria so weapons can be sent to rebel fighters. Mr Hague said earlier this week that no decisions have been made on whether the U.K. will allow the embargo to expire as scheduled on June 1, effectively clearing the way to arm the rebels. He said if the situation in Syria continues to deteriorate, there will be a ""strong case"" for amending or lifting the arms embargo. The communique also condemned North Korea's aggressive rhetoric and the development of its nuclear missile programs, saying that Pyongyang's recent actions threaten international security. Their statement came just hours after North Korea delivered a fresh round of rhetoric with claims it had 'powerful striking means' on standby for a missile launch and amid speculation that it is preparing to test a medium-range missile during the country's upcoming national celebration.","The Foreign Secretary was joined by the actress at a G8 meeting in London .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:41 EST, 12 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:49 EST, 13 April 2013 . Jonathan Winters, the cherub-faced comedian whose breakneck improvisations and misfit characters inspired the likes of Robin Williams and Jim Carrey, has died. He was 87. The Ohio native died Thursday evening at his Montecito, California, home of natural causes, said Joe Petro III, a longtime friend. He was surrounded by family and friends. 'He was just a great friend and I was very lucky to be able to work with him for all the years I did,' said Petro, an artist and printmaker who collaborated with Winters for decades on numerous art projects. 'We've lost a giant and we're really going to miss him.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Legend: Comedian Jonathan Winters, seen in 1997, died on Thursday by natural causes at the age of 87 . Inspiration: The actor and comedian, seen right in a scene from 1967 filme Eight on the Lam, inspired Robin Williams, Jim Carrey and many others in his time . Winters was a pioneer of improvisational standup comedy, with an exceptional gift for mimicry, a grab bag of eccentric personalities and a bottomless reservoir of creative energy. Facial contortions, sound effects, tall tales — all could be used in a matter of seconds to get a laugh. 'Beyond funny, He invented a new category of comedic genius,' comedian Albert Brooks tweeted Friday. On Jack Paar's television show in 1964, Winters was handed a foot-long stick and he swiftly became a fisherman, violinist, lion tamer, canoeist, U.N. diplomat, bullfighter, flutist, delusional psychiatric patient, British headmaster and Bing Crosby's golf club. 'As a kid, I always wanted to be lots of things,' Winters told U.S. News & World Report in 1988. 'I was a Walter Mitty type. I wanted to be in the French Foreign Legion, a detective, a doctor, a test pilot with a scarf, a fisherman who hauled in a tremendous marlin after a 12-hour fight.' Recognized work: Robin Williams stands beside Mr Winters, who stared in Mork and Mindy with Williams, as he accepts the Pioneer Award at the taping of the 6th annual TV Land Awards in 2008 . The humor most often was based in reality — his characters Maude Frickert and Elwood P. Suggins, for example, were based on people Winters knew growing up in Ohio. A devotee of Groucho Marx and Laurel and Hardy, Winters and his free-for-all brand of humor inspired Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, Tracey Ullman and Lily Tomlin, among many others. But Williams and Carrey are his best-known followers. Carson in particular lifted Winters' Maude Frickert character almost intact for the long-running Aunt Blabby character he portrayed on 'The Tonight Show.' It was Williams, meanwhile, who helped introduce Winters to millions of new fans in 1981 as the son of Williams' goofball alien and his earthling wife in the final season of ABC's 'Mork and Mindy.' The two often strayed from the script. 'The best stuff was before the cameras were on, when he was open and free to create,' Williams once said. 'Jonathan would just blow the doors off.' Entertainer: Winters, seen performing in Las Vegas left in 1959 and right while hosting ABC's 1967 Holiday on Ice special, is remembered for his facial contortions, sound effects and tall tales . Winters' only Emmy was for best-supporting actor for playing Randy Quaid's father in the sitcom 'Davis Rules' (1991). He was nominated again in 2003 as outstanding guest actor in a comedy series for an appearance on 'Life With Bonnie.' He also won two Grammys: One for his . work on 'The Little Prince' album in 1975 and nother for his 'Crank . Calls' comedy album in 1996. He also won the Kennedy Center's second . Mark Twain Prize for Humor in 1999, a year after Richard Pryor. Winters . was sought out in later years for his changeling voice, and he . contributed to numerous cartoons and animated films. Fittingly, he . played three characters in the 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle' movie in 2000. The . Internet Movie Database website credits him as the voice of Papa in the . forthcoming 'The Smurfs 2' film. He continued to work almost to the end . of his life, and to influence new generations of comics. 'No him, no me. No MOST of us, comedy-wise,' tweeted comic Patton Oswalt. Winters had made television history in 1956, when RCA broadcast the first public demonstration of color videotape on 'The Jonathan Winters Show.' Awards: Winters, seen performing in Las Vegas in 1971, won a best-supporting actor Emmy, was nominated again in 2003 as outstanding guest actor, won two Grammys and the Kennedy Center's second Mark Twain Prize for Humor in 1999 . The comedian quickly realized the possibilities, author David Hajdu wrote in The New York Times in 2006. He soon used video technology 'to appear as two characters, bantering back and forth, seemingly in the studio at the same time. You could say he invented the video stunt.' Winters was born Nov. 11, 1925, in Dayton, Ohio. Growing up during the Depression as an only child whose parents divorced when he was 7, Winters spent a lot of time entertaining himself. Winters, who himself battled alcoholism in his younger years, described his father as an alcoholic. But he found a comedic mentor in his mother, radio personality Alice Bahman. 'She was very fast. Whatever humor I've inherited I'd have to give credit to her,' Winters told the Cincinnati Enquirer in 2000. Winters joined the Marines at 17 and served two years in the South Pacific. He returned to study at the Dayton Art Institute, helping him develop keen observational skills. At one point, he won a talent contest (and the first prize of a watch) by doing impressions of movie stars. After stints as a radio disc jockey and TV host in Ohio from 1950-53, he left for New York, where he found early work doing impressions of John Wayne, Cary Grant, Marx and James Cagney, among others. Last year: Winters poses at a screening of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, California, in July of 2012 . One night after a show, an older man sweeping up told him he wasn't breaking any new ground by mimicking the rich or famous. 'He said, ""What's the matter with those characters in Ohio? I'll bet there are some far-out dudes that you grew up with back in Ohio,""' Winters told the Orange County Register in 1997. Two days later, he cooked up one of his most famous characters: the hard-drinking, dirty old woman Maude Frickert, modeled in part on his own mother and an aunt. Appearances on Paar's show and others followed and Winters soon had a following. And before long, he was struggling with depression and drinking. - Jonathan Winters . 'I became a robot,' Winters told TV critics in 2000. 'I almost lost my sense of humor ... I had a breakdown and I turned myself in (to a mental hospital). It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do.' Winters was hospitalized for eight months in the early 1960s. It's a topic he rarely addressed and never dwelled on. 'If you make a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year and you're talking to the blue-collar guy who's a farmer 200 miles south of Topeka, he's looking up and saying, ""That bastard makes (all that money) and he's crying about being a manic depressive?""' Winters said. When he got out, there was a role as a slow-witted character waiting in the 1963 ensemble film 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.' 'I finally opened up and realized I was in charge,' Winters told PBS interviewers for 2000's 'Jonathan Winters: On the Loose.' ''Improvisation is about taking chances, and I was ready to take chances.' Roles in other movies followed, as did TV shows, including his own. While show business kept Winters busy, the former art school student was also a painter and writer. 'I find painting a much slower process than comedy, where you can go a mile a minute verbally and hope to God that some of the people out there understand you,' he told U.S. News and World Report in 1988. 'I don't paint every day. I'm not that motivated. I don't do anything the same every day. Discipline is tough for a guy who is a rebel.' Among his books is a collection of short stories called 'Winters' Tales' (1987). 'I've done for the most part pretty much what I intended — I ended up doing comedy, writing and painting,' he told U.S. News. 'I've had a ball. And as I get older, I just become an older kid.' Winters' wife, Eileen, died in 2009. He is survived by two children, Lucinda Winters and Jay Winters.","Winters is celebrated for his hilarious improvisations, misfit characters, mimicry and facial contortions .

A sex offender repeatedly raped an 11-year-old schoolgirl in a park and then bragged he would show a video of the attack to her family and friends, a court heard today. Opemipo Jaji, 18, is alleged to have followed the 11-year-old girl as she made her way home from school last November. The girl told police in a video interview played to the court that the attack happened after she had got off a bus. She said she was walking along a road in Enfield, north London, when a man dragged her into Jubilee Park and repeatedly raped her. She said: 'He kept saying ‘Stop moving or I will stab you’. 'I tried to run away but then he grabbed me when . I got to the pavement of the park entrance. 'I kept on saying ‘stop’ because it was hurting me and he kept saying ‘shut up’ to me. He was just saying it every time I spoke. 'When I was on the floor, he said he would film me and send it into my school. 'I was saying ‘Get off me, get off me, stop’.” The youngster was recorded a week after the attack which resulted in her undergoing an operation for an injury. In the video, the youngster, who can not be identified, told police:  ‘He said the reason he wanted to attack and have sex with me was because I didn’t have anything else like my phone - I didn’t have anything.’ She said the attacker had demanded her phone number as she left, but she lied and said she had forgotten it. Jaji is then said to have told her: ‘If I were you I would go home and remember my phone number right now.’ Police search teams in Jubilee Park in Enfield looking for clues at the time of the rape in November 2012 . The girl said her attacker was a black man with a small afro, dressed in grey and black and wearing an ‘opaque’ headdress. Jurors at the Old Bailey have been . told Jaji will claim he has been wrongly identified - though prosecutors . say blood found on his shoes and bag match the girl’s DNA with a . one-in-a-billion match. She said: ‘He stank just like he hadn’t had a bath. He smelled a bit like smoke, like garbage. ‘He had a London, Edmonton, chavvy accent.’ Her father told the Old Bailey that his daughter usually returned home at around 4.30pm, but by 5pm he had failed to turn up. As he prepared the family meal and . became 'frustrated 'by not knowing where she was and sent messages on . Facebook asking if anyone had seen her. Just before 6pm police were informed that she had not returned home and a patrol took details of the missing girl. However at 8pm, as he and his wife . sat in the living room, they heard a tapping on the glass of the front . door and on the doorstep stood their daughter 'dishevelled and panicky . 'with her clothes in disarray. Terrifying assault: The girl finally reached home at 8pm and was taken to hospital for surgery . As they sat her on the settee and he . hugged his daughter 'to reassure her she was okay now,'she said she 'had . been attacked and she thought she had been raped.” In his statement read to the Old Bailey, he said: 'As you can imagine we were all upset by this. 'I had my arm around comforting her. She said the man who attacked her had left a glove in her mouth. She . said it was really hard to breathe and thought she was going to die.' Rosina Cottage, QC, prosecuting, said Jaji had 'an interest in pre-pubescent girls'. The previous year, Jaji had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting and robbing another girl dressed in her school uniform. Jaji was arrested for the park attack a few days later after CCTV was viewed, and his bedroom searched. A book was found about a little girl . being sexually assaulted, ads for child care vacancies and a picture of a . little girl in Australia marked FC - a possible reference to Facebook.

Laurene Powell Jobs spoke about how her famous husband Steve left both a personal and a private legacy, only one of which she feels comfortable talking about now that he is dead. 'In the public (legacy) we see the products that he created, that he cared so deeply about that changed all of our lives- the way that we function and communicate,' she said in an interview with NBC's Brian Williams on Rock Center that aired Friday night. Scroll down for video . Life after love: Laurene Powell Jobs talked about how her husband Steve left a private and public legacy . Tender moment: Though he was known best as the Apple CEO, Laurene said that she and their children miss Steve as a loving father and husband (seen together in 2011) What he wanted to do in his life was create tools that allow people to work at the highest level, and I think he did that. So that legacy is beautiful for me to live with.' Mrs Powell Jobs, who continues her husband's tradition of being notoriously private, agreed to be interviewed because she is working with a documentary filmmaker to promote immigration reform. As part of the preconditions for the interview, she made it clear that she would not talk about her famous husband's death. That said, she did pay a small tribute to her husband of 20 years by praising him as a father and partner. In his absence: Laurene said that seeing how Apple products have changed the world makes her feel good about the work that her husband did while he was alive . In the living: Steve Jobs died in October 2011, but since his death, Laurene has become involved in the push for immigration reform . Lips sealed: Mrs Powell Jobs only spoke briefly about her husband, saying that seeing Apple products around the world is a positive reminder of his great work . 'His private legacy with me and the kids is that of husband and father, and we miss him every day,' she said. Jobs was known for his intense work ethic, and even he admitted that part of the reason why he allowed a biographer to interview him repeatedly before his death was so that his children could get a full portrait of the work he did while away from his family. In addition to the more than 650-page tome, Mrs Powell Jobs told how the myriad of Apple products that he created also serve as living memorials. Passion project: Mrs Powell Jobs teamed up with filmmaker Davis Guggenheim to created a documentary about the struggles of undocumented immigrants . 'Having the body of work surrounding us is actually a really beautiful reminder and I find it touching and inspiring for me to make sure that I continue to do what I'm most passionate about and I hope my kids feel the same way,' she said. That passion has driven her to work with Academy Award-winning director Davis Guggenheim to create and promote the film ‘The Dream is Now’ which unveils the plight of students raised in the United States who are pushed out of the country because they are undocumented immigrants.","Laurene Powell Jobs speaks out for the first time since her husband Steve's death .

Baroness Thatcher is to blame for the UK's adversarial relationship with Brussels and other European powers still cannot trust a British Prime Minister 23 years after she left office, one of her greatest political rivals said today. Helmut Kohl, who was German Chancellor while the Iron Lady was in power, said their persistent rows meant they never had a good relationship. While the 83-year-old praised Mrs Thatcher's bold attitude and honesty, he said today her European legacy is an antagonistic relationship on both sides of the Channel. Strained: Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he never managed to have a good relationship with Baroness Thatcher and her attitude still causes problems for Britain . 'It is true — Margaret Thatcher was difficult, just as our relationship was difficult,' Mr Kohl told The Times. 'Unlike with other leaders in Europe and the world, and despite the best efforts of both sides, Margaret and I simply never managed to build a trusting and warm relationship. '[She] wanted Europe, but a different Europe from that wanted by most of her European colleagues and me. From our point of view, this antagonism characterises British policy on Europe to this day. 'But it is also true that Margaret Thatcher was an impressive personality, an admirable woman and a great Prime Minister of Britain.' One of his successors, Angela Merkel, has been invited to Lady Thatcher's funeral next week, but is yet to accept. Relationship: Mr Kohl says Mrs Thatcher was hard to work with but admired her bravery and honesty . Message: German chancellor Angela Merkel signs the condolence book for Margaret Thatcher at the British Embassy in Berlin today . It came as the Baroness's legacy was discussed in the Commons and Lords yesterday, where her attitude to Europe was widely praised. Paying tribute to Britain's greatest post-war prime minister, David Cameron said: 'She was no starry-eyed internationalist, but again, her approach was rooted in simple, clear principles. 'Strength abroad begins with strength at home. Deterrence; not appeasement. The importance of national sovereignty – which is why she fought so passionately for Britain’s interests in Europe and always believed Britain should retain its own currency. 'Above all she believed to the core of her being that Britain stood for something in the world – for democracy, for the rule of law, for right over might'. Speech: David Cameron yesterday told the Commons that Lady Thatcher made Britain great again and fought for a better deal in Europe . It was Lady Thatcher's determination to earn Britain an EU rebate that remains one of her greatest successes. For four years, to the embarrassment of other officials, she would mention the need for a cash deal at every European meeting, until she got her way in 1984. Foreign Secretary William Hague said: 'When it comes to money, the rebate she negotiated for this country from the EU has brought us so far £75 billion - which is twice the size of our annual defence budget.'","Helmut Kohl said they had persistent rows and were never friends .

A Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus elephant was shot in a drive-by shooting while resting in its pen early Tuesday morning. The 39-year-old Asian elephant named Carol was standing outside Tupelo, Mississippi’s BancorpSouth Arena around 2am when a single shot was fired into her enclosure, according to police. 'She was shot between her ear and her shoulder, kind of in the base of her neck,' Capt Rusty Haynes of the Topelo police department told MailOnline. 'She's going to be OK.' Scroll down for video . Shooting victim: Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus elephant, Carol, seen here last December, became the victim of a drive-by shooting on Tuesday morning in Mississippi but is said to be recovering well . Felony offense: The elephant, seen here performing, is believed to have been intentionally shot by a gunman facing him or her with felony charges since Asian elephants are endangered . 'I think it was malicious act,' Haynes said of the gunman's intent, before adding he believes it was out of 'stupidity' alone. A security guard at the scene was able to immediately send for help and medical assistance for the elephant. Twenty minutes later she's said to have been walking around her enclosure eating carrots, Kevan Kirkpatrick, BancorpSouth Arena's marketing director told the Clarion Ledger. An elephant’s skin is an average of 1 inch (2.5cm) think in most places, while extremely tough. The type of firearm used was not immediately known . on Tuesday, with police saying the bullet encasing has yet to be removed . from the animal for analysis. Scene: Authorities are looking for a white or silver Ford Explorer that was seen driving past the scene, pictured, at the time of the attack early Tuesday morning (file photo) Survivor: The elephant is said to be doing very well and recovering after her injury, with elephants' skin typically being up to an inch thick in places (file photo) '[Dr. Dennis] Schmitt . located a dime size point of entry on the elephant’s shoulder,' BancorpSouth said in a statement on their Facebook page late Tuesday. 'Upon . further evaluation the elephant is active, mobile and comfortable. She . is being treated with medication and will be taken to Springfield, . Missouri where she will remain under veterinary care over the next . several weeks. Carol is expected to make a full recovery,' it read. No other animals were harmed and the circus has flown in their own veterinarians to follow up on the elephant's health. Because Asian elephants are an endangered species the crime is a federal offense under the Endangered Species Act. Authorities say they are now looking for a white or silver Ford Explorer that was seen driving past the scene at the time of the attack. Haynes says they currently have no suspects in the case, emphasizing to the Carion Ledger: 'We're dealing with a victim that can't talk.' Police say they are reviewing area . surveillance footage and requesting the public's help for any tips and . information leading to the shooter. The elephant is part of the circus in town for a series of performances with the Tupelo show beginning on Thursday that are planning to go on. 'We have had the circus once a year since 1995,' Mr Kirkpatrick said. 'Absolutely this is the first elephant shooting we’ve had.' Outpouring of support and sympathy for the elephant has since been seen on BancorpSouth's Facebook page. 'I am praying for the elephant that got shot just sad,' one man wrote.

These dramatic pictures show terrified passengers being evacuated from a plane that was about to leave Glasgow Airport but suddenly became filled with smoke. At least 20 were injured in the incident this morning, where the pilot of a Jet2 aircraft bound for Alicante in Spain was forced to abort its take-off. Four people were taken to hospital and another 13 people received treatment at the scene for minor injuries, after the evacuation at 7.40am. In a shaky video filmed by one of the 189 passengers, several people are shown sliding down the plane's inflatable exit chutes. Scroll down for video . Scary: Passengers, including a woman in green, were forced to slide down the Jet2 plane's emergency chute but some may have been injured in the process, bottom right . The video hears the plane's alarms ringing out and some screaming while the person filming says simply 'this is crazy' and tells people sliding down to be careful. Many of the people injured were hurt as they left the plane, and some may have clattered into eachother when going down the chutes, Jet2 has admitted. Passenger Stephen McFadden said 'people started running' as the 737's pilot shouted 'get out get out after carrying out an emergency stop. 'We were careering up the runway and smoke started belting out of all the air vents with a smouldering smell,' he said. 'Then the brakes went on and the emergency chutes went out and we were all evacuated. Evacuation: This Jet2 plane, stranded on the Tarmac at Glasgow Airport, was about to take-off when smoke was detected in its cabin, forcing a mass evacuation . 'I have a nine-week-old daughter and a four-year-old daughter. I had my nine-week-old attached to my chest as I went down the emergency chute and my wife had our four-year-old and was in tears. 'It was like something out of a movie. There was panic, people started running and I shouted 'slow down', and then the pilot shouted ""get out, get out"". ""It was just sheer panic, something no-one would want to go through again."" Fellow passenger Graham Divers, 40, a businessman from Glasgow, said: 'We were going full throttle down the tarmac when me and the chap sitting next to me saw smoke swirling above our heads. 'He said he thought he saw it coming from the right engine. 'I didn't know what to do, so I was about to shout to the cabin crew when the pilot obviously sussed it. 'He slammed the brakes on really hard and put the engines into reverse. 'There was a stunned silence when we stopped, everyone was in shock. 'The captain called the cabin crew into the cockpit and a few minutes later yelled 'evacuate, evacuate'. 'The crew were brilliant. They ushered us onto the wing. I was a little worried because I could smell aviation fuel. Evacuation: The incident involving a Jet2 plane (file picture) caused the closure of the Scottish airport . 'The captain should be praised because I looked back and he was running up and down the cabin to make sure everyone else was off before him.

At least 12 flights were unable to take off from Glasgow and a number of others have been diverted to Edinburgh. Managing director of Jet2 Ian Doubtfire travelled to Glasgow from the company's Leeds base to talk to staff and deal with the incident. He said: 'During the very early part of the take-off, smoke was seen in the aircraft and the cabin crew informed the captain and he stopped the take-off. 'I've talked to the crew extensively about what happened and they said that the exit from the aeroplane was textbook. 'Obviously, they do a lot of training for this and they said that it was done in the required time, as you have to evacuate quickly with smoke on board.' Mr Doubtfire said injuries when evacuating an aircraft via chutes are common. 'It is possible to get injured when evacuating quite fast,' he said. 'People often stop at the bottom and . others may come and slide into them or whatever, but all the chutes . operated normally and the evacuation was textbook.' He added that the passengers onboard the flight will still be able to travel to Spain today. 'We have asked the passengers if they . wish to travel to Alicante and most of them want to do so, so we are . arranging an aircraft to come and collect them this afternoon and leave . around 3pm.'

This office may be the most fun in Britain as it comes kitted out with a giant helter-skelter slide . Their design brief was to transform the 17,000sq ft office into 'the best place in the UK to work.' Lead designer Sarah O'Callaghan said fun and play was at the heart of the vision.

If they don't go down it, they are not buying into the culture of the business.' The unique new office is fittingly situated on the end of a pier. Dominic Monkhouse, managing director at Peer 1 Hosting, said anyone can use the facilities whenever they like. He said: 'We are trusting.

She says she's blessed with the biggest cleavage in Britain, but Claire Smedley is terrified her 40MMM breasts will kill her relationship. Three years ago her ex-boyfriend nearly died when she suffocated him with her breasts him during sex. They have since grown even bigger and now weigh 2.5 stone each. The 30-year-old mother-of-three, who lives in Derby with her new boyfriend Chris Willgoose, says she worries it could happen again, and is always on her guard during sex. Claire Smedley, who lives in Derby with her new boyfriend Chris Willgoose, says she is always on her guard during sex after her ex-boyfriend nearly suffocated . Claire says she demands sex up to five times a day, blaming high oestrogen levels for both her libido and her large breasts . She said: 'Once he’s had enough he’ll tap my leg and I’ll get off. It’s nice to know he appreciates them, but I won’t let things go too far. 'My last relationship ended because he was too scared to have sex with me. I don’t want that to happen again.' Claire says she demands sex up to five times a day, blaming high oestrogen levels for both her libido and big breasts. She said: 'I read on the internet that high oestrogen levels can make your breasts grow, so I’m guessing that’s what’s causing it. 'I’ve been to the doctor but they didn’t know what was wrong. It’s got to the point now where I’m terrified they won’t stop growing.' When Claire was 11, she went for her first bra fitting and discovered she was a C cup. Claire, who claims her 40MMM breasts are the biggest in Britain, says she has started to make a glamour modelling career off the back of them . She said: 'Mum and dad joked that I went to bed and came downstairs the next morning with massive knockers. 'At the time I was so embarrassed. Girls at school used to unclip my bra strap during assembly, while boys stared at my boobs as though they were from outer space. I used to sleep on my front hoping they wouldn’t grow anymore.' But by the time she turned 12, she’d shot up to a DD cup. She said: 'Everyone always thought I was older than I was. Sometimes the bus driver wouldn’t let me on with a child fare - it was so humiliating.' By the time Claire turned 16, they’d swelled to an H cup. She said: 'I was told to cover up in my local church in case I led the men into temptation.' But the advice from the church had the exact opposite effect on the teen. Claire said: 'I was angry - after all I thought, ""it’s not my fault"". So I decided to rebel, getting rid of all my turtle necks in exchange for spaghetti string tops. Even though I didn’t like my boobs, they were a part of me. I was tired of pretending to be someone I wasn’t.' By the time Claire turned 18, her breasts had grown to a J cup, swamping her size 6 frame. She said: 'I looked ridiculous, though I always received appreciative stares from men. I desperately hoped that the growth spurt had come to an end because I’d started to get scared. I didn’t know what I’d do if they kept on growing. I considered a breast reduction, but the thought of a surgeon hacking away at my breasts terrified me.' But the biggest threat wasn’t to Claire - it was to her boyfriend. When Claire was 27, ex-boyfriend Mark nearly died when she suffocated him with her 40LL breasts which weighed more than a stone each. Claire said she had considered a breast reduction, but it is not an option because her BMI is too high for surgery . Claire, pictured at the age of 21, would need to lose eight stone for a reduction to be carried out safely . She said: 'Usually, he loved being smothered by them, and on this occasion, he started flailing around wildly. But I assumed it was because he was so excited, so I kept going. A few minutes later, I noticed he’d stopped moving.' By then Mark, also 27, was still and appeared not to be breathing. Claire said: 'I was panicking and was just about to call 999 when thankfully he started to come round. He appeared dazed and confused but then he sat up and coughed. I was so relieved.' Claire has rekindled a relationship with old flame Chris Willgoose, whom she married aged 21 but later split from . But after Mark’s near death experience, the couple’s sex life flagged. Claire said: 'After that, he went right off sex.' The pair split up three months later, while her breasts continued to grow. She said: 'They were showing no signs that they were about to stop growing, so I knew I had to start taking precautions.' When Claire managed to rekindle a relationship with old flame Chris Willgoose, whom she married aged 21 but later split from, she knew she was treading on thin ice. Claire, who now has three children with Chris - aged three, six, and nine, said: 'I knew Chris loved my boobs, but I couldn’t put his life at risk. So we devised a safety precaution where he’d tap my leg if it ever gets too much, and I’d climb off.' Claire, who claims her 40MMM breasts are the biggest in Britain, says she has started to make a glamour modelling career off the back of them. She said: 'I’ve got a lot of fans in Germany, so it would be great to go over there and tap the market.' But behind the glitz and glam, Claire reveals that having big breasts is not easy. She said: 'I get back ache all the time. And doing simple things, like tying my shoelaces or running after the kids, is impossible. 'Shops never stock my bra size, so the only option is to get one tailor made, but that costs £200. And while some women might like the attention from men, not all of it’s flattering. 'In fact, most of it’s rather unimaginative - ""get em out"", ""look at the size of em"" and so on, but when someone tries to pull your dress down in a bar, it’s not funny. Claire says she suffers from back ache and finds it difficult to do simple things, such as tying her shoelaces or running after her children . Claire's partner Chris has said he will support whatever decision she makes when it comes to whether she should have a breast reduction . 'Sometimes, when the straps on my top have snapped under their weight, I’ve come home holding my clothes up and desperate for a breast reduction.' But for Claire, a breast reduction isn’t an option. Weighing 20 stone, Claire’s BMI is too high for surgery. She would need to lose eight stone for a reduction to be carried out safely. She said: 'Sometimes I do think I would like a reduction, but I know I’d need to lose weight first. Even so, I don’t know how I’d feel having smaller breasts. I don’t know if I’d be the same person and it would most certainly end my modelling career.' Meanwhile Claire’s partner Chris is prepared to support whatever decision she makes. He said: 'Obviously I love Claire’s breasts - I’ve had a lot of fun with them. But I’ll support whatever decision she makes as I just want her to be comfortable - it’s her body at the end of the day.'","Claire Smedley's ex-boyfriend nearly died when he suffocated during sex .

Plan: Nottingham City Council is trying to tackle childhood obesity by employing lifestyle coaches to help youngsters lose weight . A council has been criticised for spending thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money on lifestyle coaches for overweight youngsters. Nottingham City Council will target pupils as young as five by sending teams of fat camp-style trainers to deprived areas to promote healthy living. The scheme - which is expected to cost around £20,000 - aims to encourage youngsters from poor backgrounds to exercise more and ditch sweet snacks in favour of fruit and vegetables. But parents and campaigners yesterday criticised the move as 'patronising' and said it should be up to parents to get their kids active. Tony Parkinson, 58, who has two children at Glenbrook Primary in Bilborough, Nottinghamshire, as well as two secondary schoolchildren, said: 'I think the lifestyle coaches are a waste of money. 'Parents should be responsible for the heath of their children. We make sure ours eat well and encourage them to be active. None of them are overweight.' The council will pilot the scheme in the deprived Bilborough area of the city from September, with up to nine coaches being sent to 12 district primary schools. Mother-of-three Caroline Clough, 43, accused the council of 'chucking money down the drain.' She said: 'I feel like they don't trust me to feed me kids the right things and get them exercising. 'It's patronising, I take my children to the local park for a play and it would be better if they spent the money on improving that for everyone rather than on sending these coaches in to schools. 'I don't like the idea of some army major type screaming at children if they are a bit overweight. 'The way obesity is measured for kids . these days is so strict that even normal sized children are classed as . overweight. I think it's all wrong.' Lifestyle: Children's expanding waste lines have been blamed on a lack of exercise and poor diet . Ms Clough said children should be educated about healthy eating and exercise by parents and teachers. Taxpayers' groups also criticised the initiative, branding it 'ridiculous.' Robert Oxley, Campaign Manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Tackling obesity at an early age is an important way of saving money in the long run but that shouldn't need a ridiculously named lifestyle coach. 'Ensuring children are regularly . active and taking part in sport in school is a far better way of helping . children live a healthy style.Children . will always want the sweeter things in life, it's up to parents to . ensure they're eating well, not an expensive taxpayer funded lifestyle . coach.' The council . yesterday defended the move, which came in the wake of a report last . year which revealed one-fifth of 11-year-olds in the city were obese. Criticism: The lifestyle coaches will encourage youngsters to ditch sweets for more fruit and vegetables - but critics say the trainers are a waste of money (stock picture) Martin Smith, sports, outdoor learning and adventure services manager for the council, said: 'We want to reduce obesity rates among children. We already have a range of programmes, such as one which encourages children to go swimming. 'We are starting in the Bilborough area, but will move it across more of the city if it is a success. The coaches have been getting training. 'They will be fully briefed on providing dietary tips in schools as well as encouraging uptake in sports, particularly among those who are less active. They will be looking at the best way of getting children to do more sports.' Seven coaches have already been picked and two more may also join the team. The council, which has to make £17 million in savings by 2014, will spend £11,000 on the scheme after receiving £9,000 from national charity the Youth Sport Trust. A council spokesman said: 'Obesity rates are a concern and this is one thing we are targeting by getting more children into sport. It is down to the lifestyle coaches themselves to develop programmes which will make this work. This can be done by more sporting activities in school or even after school.' Nottingham's most-recent Health Profile, published last year, revealed 22.2 per cent of children who finished primary school in 2011 - those aged 10 and 11 - were classed as obese .","Nottingham City Council targets obesity with 'fat camp-style' coaches .

The Japanese wife of a retired British author has been banned from returning to the UK after leaving the country to care for her dying mother. Machiko Oyama, 56, a former teacher, has been married to William Judge, 70, for 18 years and lived with him in a £1million London flat. But she has been denied permission to re-enter Britain after her mother's death because she had been abroad for longer than the two years permitted. Dispute: William Judge and his Japanese wife Machiko Oyama. She had to return to Japan when her mother was diagnosed with a brain tumour but has been denied the right to return to the UK . Ms Oyama was given leave to remain in the UK two years ago after marrying Mr Judge in 1995, according to the Evening Standard. She left Britain to return to Japan in 2005 to care for her mother after she was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour. Her mother died that year, as well as two of her aunts. Ms Oyama applied to return to the UK in February but was denied permission on the grounds that she had been abroad longer than the permitted two years under immigration rules. The couple had assumed a section of the legislation which makes an exception for those who maintain a strong connection to Britain would apply to them as a married couple. But now Mr Judge faces going before an . immigration tribunal to argue for his wife to be allowed into the . country - a situation he describes as 'ludicrous,' the Standard reports. Denied: Mrs Oyama was refused a re-entry visa on the grounds that she had been outside the UK for more than two years. The UK Border Agency said it does not comment on individual cases . He said the immigration rules were 'draconian' and that they could even infringe the couple's human rights. Together with their long marriage, Mr Judge says evidence he will use of their 'strong connection' will include his regular trips to Japan to see her, their daily phone calls and the property she owns in London - on which she pays council tax. Ms Oyama told the Standard her husband stayed at her mother's home for two to three months on each visit to Japan. A Border Agency spokesman told the Standard it does not comment on individual cases but that each case would be dealt with on an individual basis.","Machiko Oyama, 56, has been married to William Judge, 70, for 18 years .

Deluded mothers are overfeeding their children because they are unable to tell if they are too chubby, new research suggests. A survey of nearly 300 mothers found they struggled to judge the weight of their own toddlers. Experts say this blind spot can lead to the youngsters being encouraged to overeat, predisposing them to obesity in later life. Deluded mothers are overfeeding their children because they are unable to tell if they are too chubby . The study was carried out by dietitian Rebecca Byrne who asked 276 mothers to describe their 12 to 16 month old toddlers as either underweight, normal weight or overweight. The researchers then measured the children's heights and weights. Ms Byrne said the mothers thought 27 of the children were too thin, but only one of these toddlers was actually underweight, with the rest a normal size. Additionally, while 32 per cent of the toddlers in the study were actually overweight, only four per cent (12 of the 276 toddlers) were perceived as too heavy by their mothers. Ms Byrne, of the Queensland University of Technology in Australia, said: ‘Mums are often worried their babies and toddlers aren't eating enough. ‘We put a lot of emphasis on weight gain in babies and toddlers as a measure of them doing well. ‘I think the perception in our society is that a chubby baby is a healthy baby and the chubbiness is something they'll grow out of - but they don't. ‘This sticks with them throughout childhood and they often end up overweight as an adult. New research has found that parents struggle to judge the weight of their own toddlers and so frequently overlook obesity problems . She added: ‘Mums who are worried their child is not gaining enough weight, may pressure them to eat more or bribe them with dessert or treats. ‘This can teach children to ignore their own cues of hunger and fullness, inadvertently promoting overeating.’ Figures show around 27 per cent of British children are now overweight. Rapid early weight gain before two years of age is associated with a two to threefold increase in the risk of obesity later in life. Ms Byrne said parents are not given the support they need to understand normal child growth and how to pick up weight problems in their children. She said: ‘Serious prevention efforts need to start early in life to reverse the trend of increasing childhood obesity and set kids up for life-long good health.’ This research comes just after another survey which showed that sixty per cent of British toddlers are hooked on chocolate and sweets. It also revealed that one in three mothers admitted to dealing with fussy eaters by bribing them with a sweet treat and that 58 per cent of mothers believe that by the age of three, their child was already craving sugary snacks on a regular basis.","Survey of mothers found mothers overfeed their children as they cannot see they are too heavy .

Tragic: Five-year-old Kelsey Smart died of meningitis after two doctors failed to spot the signs of the killer bug . A five-year-old girl who died from meningitis had been seen by two GPs less than 48 hours before she died, an inquest heard today. The doctors thought Kelsey Smart was suffering from viral gastroenteritis but in fact she had the deadly brain condition. The schoolgirl died in hospital on February 28 last year, the hearing at Avon Coroner’s Court heard. She had been examined by an out-of-hours GP on the night of February 26 and seen again the following . morning by a doctor at her local surgery. Three . hours later Kelsey started fitting and was rushed to hospital where she . later died. Her mother, Hannah Smart, told the hearing in a written . statement that she was concerned that none of the doctors who examined . Kelsey had considered meningitis. 'We . had a meeting with a senior doctor and the Orchard Medical Centre, a Dr . Yates, who suggested that Kelsey had been let down by the doctors . treating her,' she said. These feelings are echoed by myself and my . entire family. 'I am . concerned that at no point did any of the Frendoc staff or any staff . at the GP surgery inform me about meningitis and what to look out for. I believe now that she had signs and symptoms pointing to meningitis.' The . inquest heard that Kelsey, from Kingswood, Bristol, had first . starting feeling unwell on the night of February 25 and was vomiting . hourly. She . was also tired and had developed a small pinprick rash on her abdomen . and left upper leg. Mrs Smart said that by the following afternoon . Kelsey was still unwell and she called Frendoc - an out-of-hours GP . service in South Gloucestershire. A doctor called back and having spoken to Mrs Smart told her to give Kelsey Dioralyte - a brand of rehydration medication - and if she could not keep that down to ring back. When she was sick again Mrs Smart telephoned back and was told to bring Kelsey in.Mrs Smart and her daughter were seen by locum GP Dr Jens Rohrbeck. Anger: Hannah and Jamie Smart with their surviving son Jayden. Kelsey's parents have criticised doctors who missed two chances to save their daughter's life . She . told the inquest: 'I showed Dr Rohrbeck the rash on Kelsey’s chin, . tummy, chest and leg and he simply pressed the rash with his finger and . said it was caused by the virus Kelsey had. 'To . me Dr Rohrbeck did not seem very interested in Kelsey or her illness. For a lot of the consultation he seemed to be staring at me looking . blank as if he didn’t know what to do. 'When I asked him what was wrong with . Kelsey he said she had picked up a virus. He explained he would send us . down to the hospital to be seen but this would be a four-hour waste of . time. 'He said it would be . better for me to take Kelsey home and if she continued to be sick . overnight I should take her to our family GP the next day. On the advice . of Dr Rohrbeck I took Kelsey home.' The . following morning Mrs Smart rang her doctors’ surgery, The Orchard . Medical Centre in Kingswood, asking for an appointment. Kelsey and her . mother were seen by Dr Sarah Grant. Mrs Smart said: 'Kelsey sat on my lap . during the consultation and Dr Grant took her temperature which was . 37.8 degrees and listened to her chest. Mourning: The Smarts attend a memorial service for Kelsey. She died from Group B meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial strain of the disease, just four days after she started developing symptoms . 'While . we were in the consultation room she was very agitated and she pulled a . clump of hair out of her head. Dr Grant did not pass comment on this or . suggest it was anything to worry about. 'I . again highlighted Kelsey’s rash which was still present in the various . places on her body. Dr Grant prodded the rash with her finger and said . it was linked to the virus. She said children often come up in rashes . when they have a virus. 'Dr . Grant did seem to realise that I was very concerned about Kelsey and . she told me to bring Kelsey back at 4pm if there was no change. All in . all we were in the consultation room for about five minutes.' By . lunchtime Mrs Smart thought her daughter was suffering from . appendicitis and decided to drive her to hospital. On route Kelsey . started fitting and Mrs Smart pulled over and called an ambulance and . she was rushed to hospital. Questions: Mr and Mrs Smart hold a photograph of their daughter. The youngster was taken to see two doctors during her short illness . Emergency . teams rushed Kelsey to the Bristol Children’s Hospital where she was . treated with morphine and anti-inflammatories after doctors thought she . may have had a stroke. A neurosurgeon was brought in from neighbouring Frenchay Hospital to carry out an operation to try to remove fluid from the brain - but the disease had taken hold and Kelsey’s brain had swollen too much. Hannah told the inquest: 'She was connected to a life support machine. We were told the brain surgery had been unsuccessful and her brain had swollen so much she was brain damaged. 'Leaving Kelsey in that hospital and knowing her heart was still beating was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.' The Smart's have donated their daughter’s organs to help others - her heart has been given to an eight-month-old baby, a three-month-old got her liver and many more will also benefit. 'As a family we have been actively involved in fundraising for meningitis research since Kelsey's death,' said Mrs Smart, 'we miss Kelsey every day and want as many positives to come out of her death as possible.' Dr Rohrbeck told the inquest he saw Kelsey at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol and examined the rashes on her body but felt they were 'very, very small and inconspicuous' and combined with other symptoms pointed to gastroenteritis. 'I was concerned that she did look . pale,' he said. 'The last thing I did was offer Kelsey a drink of water. 'She drank it and that reassured me that I could send her home with . advice to call us back if she worsened or did not get better the next . day.' Questioned by Avon Coroner Maria Voisin, Dr Rohrbeck said that with 'hindsight' he would have sought further medical advice. 'I . thought I was dealing with viral gastroenteritis,' he said. 'I did not . associate it with a meningitis rash. Personally I have never seen a case . like this before.' Dr Lisa Goldsworthy, a consultant in . children's emergency medicine at Bristol Children's Hospital, said: 'My . feeling at the time and in hindsight was that by the time she had her . fit and was less responsive, her brain had reached a critical level of . swelling and the disease had taken hold. 'With an hour-and-a-half of the ambulance taking her to hospital there was nothing to be done.' Her . colleague Dr Sara Hulme, a consultant in paediatric intensive care, . told the inquest that had Kelsey been admitted to hospital earlier it . was unlikely doctors would have been able to reverse the swelling to her . brain. Treatment: Bristol Royal Hospital for Children where Kelsey died. The coroner at the inquest into her death recorded a narrative verdict . Dr Grant told the hearing that she examined Kelsey but was reassured that the rash on the girl's body was not getting worse. 'I did think about meningitis as the cause of the rash but discounted that at the time,' she said. 'The one thing that made me think that was the fact that the rash did not seem to have progressed. 'She had been seen 12 hours previously and a rash was detected. I think I was reassured that it did not seem to have got particularly worse over that time frame. I had a chat with mum and I booked a review appointment at 4pm the same day.' Dr Grant said it was not unusual for a child to be seen by doctors repeatedly over a short period of time. 'I think that if there was no improvement during the day I would have asked the children's hospital to review her,' she said. Coroner Voisin recorded a narrative verdict. She said: 'I am mindful of Kelsey's presentation when she was seen by each doctor. I am also mindful of the evidence of the two consultants from the children's hospital. 'It is clear from their evidence that earlier intervention is better but what cannot be said is whether earlier treatment would have resulted in a different outcome for Kelsey. Neither can we say exactly what would have happened if Kelsey had been admitted sooner. So based on the evidence I consider the appropriate verdict to be a narrative verdict.' The coroner said she would not be making any recommendations about preventing a similar tragedy from happening again in the future. Rule 43 recommendations are made by coroners with the intention of preventing deaths and learning lesson from the cause of deaths. 'During the inquest I have been mindful . of Rule 43 but having heard the evidence from the GP, taking into . account the information provided to the practice since this event and . training that has taken place, I don't think Rule 43 is appropriate,' said Ms Voisin.","'Doctors thought Kelsey Smart was suffering from viral gastroenteritis'

A married couple have revealed how they have been given a new lease of life after taking up pole dancing. Steve Hind and wife Lisa from Runcorn, Cheshire, have lost ten stone between them thanks to their new hobby and have even started pole dancing competitively. Lisa, 27, explained how they took up the class after seeing it advertised one evening as they walked home from having a curry. She said: 'We walked past a dance studio and . there was a sign about pole dancing classes. Steve said he'd love to do it. I . thought he was joking and started laughing. Then I realised he wasn't so . we went in and had a look. Pole position: Steve and Lisa Hind have lost ten stone between them after discovering a love of pole dancing . Passionate: The pair train every day and have started entering competitions . 'We knew the gym wasn't an option and we wanted to do something together. We didn't know it was going to change our lives.' Lisa said after a tricky start, she soon got the hang of it. 'The first class was . horrendous. I couldn't even lift myself up the pole. Steve took to it . like a duck to water though. He was the only guy in the class but he . didn't mind. I stuck to it - I was determined to get to where he was.' Former junk food addicts: His weight rose to 14st 13lb and hers to 15st 13lb when they decided it was time to change . After mastering the basic moves, they are now performing complex routines including aerial silk, where they perform acrobatics . while hanging from a special fabric. As well as pole fitness classes, the couple also do Bokwa, an intense cardio workout. As a result, the couple have transformed their body shapes. Steve, 48, has lost just over four stone, shrinking from 14st 13lb to a trim 10st 10lb,  while Lisa has done even better by shedding almost six stone - and can now slip into a size ten dress. New skills: Lisa has dropped from a size 14, left, and can now do complex aerial silk moves . Belly disappeared: People used to joke that Steve looked pregnant but he's now got a six pack . Lisa, who has gone from 15st 13lb to exactly 10st, said: 'After two weeks I noticed a difference. My stomach wasn't as big. We loved it so much we decided to go every night of the week. We train for four hours - five on a Monday. 'We're having so much fun, it doesn't feel like a chore. We want to be there. I'm so happy. I'm bouncing with energy and have a real spring in my step. Now . we're dancing all the time, we hardly ever go out. When people see us, . they think we've had surgery because we've lost weight so quickly.' The couple's new lifestyle is a far cry from how they used to live after they married six years ago. They would eat out four nights a week and couldn't resist their . daily trips to McDonalds for a super size burger and fries. Mastered the moves: The couple are now experts at pole dancing . Lisa said: 'When I met Steve I thought we were alright. Then we . started going out for meals and we had the wine or had cosy nights in . with take-always. We were all in love but we didn't realise what it was doing to our bodies. We got stuck in a rut. 'I couldn't fit into nice clothes and was going up sizes. Steve's belly was that big, people joked he was pregnant.' Lisa, a full-time housewife, was a . size 14 when she met Steve, a bus driver, in 2007 and they married six . months later after a whirlwind romance. By their wedding day, she had already gone up a dress size. She said: 'It happened so fast I didn't get chance to think about slimming down but I still felt comfortable. I've always been a curvy girl with broad shoulders and big legs. I had it in my head that it was just me. Weight has fallen off: The couple say they have never felt better since they ditched their unhealthy diets and joined the dance classes . 'When we got married, we were always . going out and socialising with friends. You could get two jugs of . cocktails for £10 so we'd get two each. 'Every week we went to the curry night and then the steak night at our local pub. We had McDonalds most days. They would ask you if you wanted a large for an extra few pence and we could never resist. 'I'd feel stuffed afterwards but then . we'd go home and have sweet and sour chicken for dinner. I didn't think . how much damage it was doing. I never weighed myself - I didn't know . what scales were. 'I tried different diets. You go . through stages of being good. I cut out bread and sugar. They were my . vices. But it's the worst thing you can do. It just doesn't work. 'I went to the gym but I got bored. With me, I want to see results fast and if I don't, I think it's not going to happen.' 'Addicted': Steve said he even uses the pole on the bus to practice his moves . Then in December 2011, with all the Christmas treats on the shelves, the couple decided enough was enough. Steve said: 'I'd never been that big . in my life. The guys at work called me Buddha because of my belly. I was . getting embarrassed. 'I noticed Lisa had got bigger too. I'd love her whatever size she was - big or small - but we both realised . how much we'd changed.' The determined duo stopped drinking and cut down on fast food but the real turning point was when they discovered their love of pole dancing. 'Pole dancing is addictive - we do it seven nights a week. It's fun doing it together. We've never felt better,' Lisa said. New lease of life: The pair said friends thought they must have had surgery to get their slim figures, left, but it's all thanks to their passion for pole dancing . Two months ago, the couple even . entered a pole dancing competition at LaKiTa Dance Academy, Warrington, . where they train, and Lisa came second while Steve came fourth. Lisa said: 'We weren't going to enter . at first but our instructor encouraged us to. Steve bought some tiny . gold hot pants just Kylie's and threw them on the floor afterwards when . he found out I'd beat him but we don't take it too seriously. Now they are preparing to enter their first doubles competition as the first husband and wife team in the summer. And it's not just in the competitions where they are drawing attention. Steve said: 'We were out on New . Year's Eve and I jumped on the pole. I did the scorpio move where you . hang upside down by one leg. Everyone was clapping. 'I even use the pole on my bus to practice. All the lads at the depot know about me pole dancing and think it's great. I've nearly got a six pack. We can both fit in kids' clothes. I feel fantastic. It's a new lease of life.'","Lisa and Steve Hind piled on the pounds by gorging on takeaway food .

Jo Keeling was inspired to write a series of children's books after her daughter Isabelle (now five) saved her life . A toddler who saved her mother's life by dialling 999 when she collapsed has inspired her to write a series of fun books teaching children what to do in an emergency. Isabelle Keeling was just two-years-old when she called an ambulance after her mother Jo suffered a life-threatening anaphylactic shock. Isabelle was able to recite her name, phone number and address perfectly and even opened the door for paramedics when they arrived to treat her mother. Afterwards Ms Keeling realised Isabelle had saved her life and thought other parents could benefit from teaching their children how to respond in an emergency. She has written six books for children based around the characters Izzy and Ollie (named after her two children), who are placed in emergency situations. The first publication, 'Adventure in an Ambulance', focuses on how to call an ambulance. Others in the collection discuss car seatbelts, talking to strangers, and not running away from parents. Ms Keeling, 37, a police officer from Bournemouth, Dorset, said: 'My initial plan was to write a children's story for a website so other parents could print it out. 'But a nursery advised me to turn it into a book which I thought could work, and I have spent the last two years working on that. 'When Isabelle called the ambulance in 2009 people were calling her a genius when in fact it was something all children should know. Isabelle (left, with her four-year-old brother Ollie) was just two when she called an ambulance for her mother who was suffering a life-threatening anaphylactic shock . Jo hopes her books will help other parents teach their children how to respond in an emergency . 'As a mum and a police officer I taught her to remember her name and address by using the 'Frere Jacques' tune. 'We had practised using the phone together before and played a pretend game where I called an ambulance after her little brother was ill. 'She had also watched an episode of the Tweenies just a day before I had the reaction which must have triggered her memory. 'Since then other parents have told me they used the techniques on my website to teach their children how to use the phone. 'I hope the books can help someone with any problems they might have, for example diabetes or a heart condition, when you might not be able to get to the phone yourself.'Her first book will cost £7.99 is available to buy through Amazon and her website www.izzyandollie.com .","Isabelle Keeling was just two years old .

Increasing numbers of highly skilled clinical staff are being employed on McDonalds-style 'zero-hours' contracts, risking the health and safety of NHS patients, it was revealed today. The controversial deals bind staff to being on call, despite having no guarantees on hours, pay or some employment rights. McDonald's, the world's biggest fast-food chain, employs the majority of its 87,500 UK staff on this basis, allowing them to call in workers at short notice at busy periods or not at all if it is quiet. Anger: Increasing numbers of clinical staff are being employed on zero hours contracts . They only get paid for the hours they are there, meaning they are 'in work, but not always at work,' experts say. The NHS has used this kind of contract to cover low-skilled jobs like cleaning, but now it is claimed the Government's controversial reforms are allowing more trusts to use them to cover frontline staff treating the public in hospitals and clinics. These include cardiac services, physiotherapy, psychiatric therapy, and hearing services. Labour shadow health secretary Andy Burnham told The Independent: 'I'm calling on the . Government to halt the spread of zero-hours contracts in the NHS pending . an urgent review into the potential risks to continuity of care and . patient safety. 'What is going on here is the unpicking of the fabric of the employment . system of the NHS in England. Zero-hours contracts have previously . operated safely within the NHS. They suited some staff willing to trade a . bit of uncertainty for extra pay. But it's very different to extend . these contracts into core delivery services. 'It is the casualisation of our health service, turning parts of the NHS into a temping workforce.' The growing use of the . contracts was a 'depressing symptom of the Government's drive to turn . England's health service into a full-blown market,' he added. Big employer: The controversial contracts are used by McDonald's, allowing them to manage staffing levels . Critics fear that trusts could be left . in a 'G4S situation', where they are unable to muster enough staff when . some of these 'zero-hours' staff fail to turn up for shifts because they . are working elsewhere or put off the job because of their contract. G4S suffered humiliation this summer . when on the eve of London 2012 it revealed it could not bring in enough . staff, meaning thousands of soldiers were brought in to guard the Games. Ban: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham says he wants the contracts stopped . Union Unison, who have highlighted the situation, say they are getting 'worrying feedback' from their members working in the NHS about the issue. They say the situation will be made worse because Government reforms will allow patients more choice about where they want to be treated. Hospital trusts and private firms are turning to the contracts because they are competing for work, they say. A Unison spokesman says the situation means providers 'do not know how much work will be given, because it is supposed to be up to patients to decide which provider they choose. 'Yet in order to be approved as a provider, they must demonstrate they . can operate with spare capacity so they can meet increasing patient . demand should that happen. But rather than simply hire staff that might . be needed, which is expensive, many providers are turning to zero-hours . contracts. The whole thing is an unnecessary, untested experiment – a . nightmare.' Trusts using these contracts include Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals, South Gloucester and University Hospitals Bristol. Trusts like Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals told the Independent that it allows them to have a 'pool of experienced staff that are able to help out at . times of increased demand', while the Bristol trust said it saved public money by reducing the need to use more expensive agency staff. A Department of Health spokesman told MailOnline: 'The use of bank staff . in the NHS is nothing new and has nothing to do with the health reforms. NHS . Trusts have always had the flexibility to employ staff on such contracts. 'However, because the cost of employing these staff tends to be higher than the . cost of permanent staff, the NHS should only use such contracts when it is the . most appropriate use of its resources.'","Using these deals staff are on call but only paid for the hours they work .

Wily: Leah Gayle Shipman skirted a potential 15-year prison sentence by marrying the victim she formerly seduced . A former teacher facing a lengthy prison sentence for seducing a student has avoided jail by marrying her teenage lover. Leah Gayle Shipman, 42, wed Johnnie Ray Ison, now 19, in January of 2011 - two years after her arrest for having sex with the then 15-year-old student at a Wilmington high school, The Wilmington Star-News reports. As a result, officials cannot now compel Ison to render evidence against Shipman - and all statements he previously made to police concerning their affair are no longer admissible at trial. Under North Carolina law, a defendant's spouse cannot be compelled to testify against the defendant in criminal cases or grand jury proceedings. 'None of the statements made in this case would be admissible without the victim,' Brunswick County Assistant District Attorney Gina Essey  said. 'The defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against them.' Shipman, of Wilmington, was reportedly married at the time of her trysts with Ison, and married the 19-year-old six days after divorcing her husband of 19 years. At the time of the betrothal, Simpson was facing 15 years for statutory rape and taking indecent liberties with a child, in connection with her previous sexual relationship with Ison. Shipman, who taught at Brunswick County Academy in Wilmington, was not only arrested in 2009, but suspended and eventually fired from her post at the school. Ison's mother had to reportedly give written permission for her then 17-year-old son, who was still a minor, to marry Shipman in 2011. Details of the wedding emerged only after Shipman pleaded guilty last month to a misdemeanor charge of resisting an officer that arose in connection with her arrest for the alleged abuse. Moving on: Shipman once taught Ison at Brunswick County Academy High School (pictured) in Wilmington, North Carolina . More serious charges stemming from her sexual affair with the teen were dropped when officials were informed about the marriage, The Star-News reports. The charge to which Shipman pleaded guilty reportedly stems from text messages and phone calls she made to the victim during his police interrogation at the investigation stage. 'The police witnessed the texts, and we were able to get them from the phone,' Essey said. Shipman was sentenced on December 20 to a 30-day suspended jail sentence, a year of probation and $345 in restitution. She was also ordered to surrender her teaching license. On the same day, Ison pleaded guilty on unrelated charges to one felony count of breaking and entering and two counts of larceny. He received 24 months probation.","Johnnie Ray Ison, now 19, cannot be compelled to testify against 42-year-old wife .

Swarmed: The paparazzi surrounded the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star . Walk this way: Kim was escorted all the way to her chauffeured car . That would mean that Kris would have been late for the hearing anyway. According to TMZ, while . the court was told that Kris was detained in New York, Judge Goldberg, . who was presiding over the case, was unimpressed and set a sanction . hearing, which means Kris could face fines for not turning up. During the court hearing, Kim reportedly sat in the jury box, her hands crossed on her lap as the case was called. Motherly: It appeared as though Kim was going for a more demure and motherly look .

Kim and Kris's divorce case is certainly heating up, and it was recently revealed that Kris is desperately trying to get Kim to admit under oath that scenes for her reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians were staged to make him look bad. A witness list in the case include several producers and television executives who are testifying in the case. Jay Russell, a producer on the show, has already said to have been grilled in one deposition. According to Radaronline.com, he admitted that one episode of the show, featuring Kris, was 'scripted, reshot or edited'. According to Russell, the scene was was intended to paint Kris as a 'villain'. Another particular scene of the E! reality show will also be picked apart. It is the moment when Kim tells her mother and manager Kris Jenner that she wanted a divorce from Kris whilst the pair are on a business trip to Dubai.

Kris is also set to take the stand where he will be questioned about the show's legitimacy, according to a Radaronline source. 'Kim is freaking out that she is going to be forced to testify that aspects of the Kardashian reality show are fake,' the insider said. 'Kim has always said how much she loves her fans and viewers.

Sylvie Cachay, 33, was discovered, half-clothed and face up in a bathtub at the Soho House hotel at around 3 a.m. on December 9 2011. According to investigators, she had red marks around her neck and a bite mark on her hand. But on the eve of her tragic death, she sent a message to ex-boyfriend Nicholas Brooks, 25, with 'F*** you' written in the title field, a court has heard. The revelation comes as Brooks, who is the son of late Oscar-winning composer and alleged sex attacker Joseph Brooks, awaits trial accused of her murder. The email, with the subject line 'F*** You', was revealed by prosecutors as they applied to a judge to include it as evidence in the long-awaited trial. 'The subject line was ""F*** you,"" and it said she was going to the police, and that’s relevant,' prosecutor Jordan Arnold told a court as he tried to argue that the District Attorney did nothing wrong in plundering Brooks' email account for clues. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Bonnie Wittner agreed that it would be in the public interest to disclose the contents of his emails to a jury. It is well known that Brooks and Cachay, . whose designs have been worn by a string of celebrities including . Lindsay Lohan, had a stormy seven-month relationship. But Brooks' defence lawyer Jeffrey Hoffman told the New York Post that the email is inadmissible, adding: 'This is nothing more than a given feeling at a given moment that was different two moments before and two moments after.'

She made swimsuits for Victoria’s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and Syla, her own label. Brooks’ father, Joseph, who won an Oscar for the 1977 hit 'You Light Up My Life,' committed suicide in 2011 amid multiple charges of sexual assault.

The elder Brooks left no money to his children and was nearly broke when he died, the New York Post reported. It's unclear whether the proceeds of his biggest hit, which still rakes in royalties, will go to his son.Prosecutors say surveillance footage show Brooks went into and out of Miss Cachay's room several times before finally leaving it after the she was dead.

His wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, was nicknamed ‘Waity Katie’ because they were together for a decade before marrying - and she had to sit out the years before William proposed. The caption on the cropped photo issued by the Press Association last November said: ‘The Duke of Cambridge making a cup of tea whilst working as a helicopter search and rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey, Wales.’ It added that the undated picture was part of a ‘day in the life’ set of photos featuring William in his work flying RAF Sea King helicopters from RAF Valley as a Search and Rescue pilot. The MoD was forced to reset the user names and computer passwords of dozens of RAF staff following an embarrassing security blunder over the William pictures last November. Original crop: The photo was originally issued last November with the mug title cropped out - but that release followed a Ministry of Defence security blunder that saw sensitive information visible in some earlier photos . Ten photographs of the future king in his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot were published by St James’s Palace on the Duke’s website before being cleared by the MoD. But the publicity exercise backfired within hours as it emerged that sensitive information was visible in four photos. In one, William was in front of a computer with a password prompt screen open. Another showed a document on the desk and an email open on a computer. Other photographs showed details of passwords and user names pinned up on a wall. By the time horrified defence officials spotted the mistake – some four hours after publication online – the shots had appeared on websites around the world, on TV and in newspapers. They were ‘rereleased’ with the details pixelated, but the MoD had no choice but to reset passwords of some personnel ‘as a precaution’.","Photo of William, 30, at RAF Anglesey base issued by St James’s Palace .

A seven-year-old girl has become Beijing's first case of a new bird flu strain that has killed 11 people. In eastern China 37 others have fallen ill, but this is the first case showing a spread to the north of the country. The girl, whose parents work in the live poultry trade, was admitted to a hospital in the capital on Thursday with a fever, sore throat, coughing and headache, the Beijing Health Bureau said on Saturday. Prevention: A city management officer kills a chicken as his colleagues stand by in a residential neighbourhood of Jiaxing, Zhejiang province . Panic: Health workers take a blood sample from a chicken imported from mainland China in Hong Kong . She was confirmed to be infected with the H7N9 virus on Saturday after tests by disease control and prevention centers. Two people in close contact with her were quarantined for observation, but have shown no symptoms so far. The virus was first spotted in late March, prompting massive slaughtering of live fowl and bans on the poultry trade in eastern Chinese cities, including Shanghai. Shanghai, the center of the outbreak, has reported 21 cases, including seven fatalities though the source of the virus has not yet been identified . The World Health Organisation says that there is no evidence as yet of human to human transmission. Contamination: Officers wear masks as they catch chickens close to a block of houses yesterday . The girl is recovering in a hospital, in a stable condition. Shanghai authorities said Saturday that a 56-year-old man, the husband of a woman hospitalised with the virus earlier this month, became the city's latest case after testing positive for H7N9. Health officials believe people are contracting the H7N9 virus through direct contact with infected poutry. Neighbouring Jiangsu province on Saturday also confirmed two more cases - a 77-year-old woman and a 72-year-old man, both in critical condition. Outbreak: Chinese officials in protection suits have been disinfecting poultry markets to contain further infection . Zhejiang province has reported 11 cases, including two today, and Anhui province has had two. China has been more open in its response to the new virus than it was a decade ago with an outbreak of SARS, when authorities were highly criticised for not releasing information. US scientists meanwhile have made a start on creating a vaccine for the new strain despite a sample from China only arriving yesterday.Government-backed researchers begun testing a 'seed' strain of the virus using a genetic code posted online.The new faster approach - born in the aftermath of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 - has seen weeks shaved off the vaccine making process.But it could still take five to six months before one is available.","Seven year-old victim's parents are in the poultry business .

Troubled: Jocelyn Wohl, 33, seen here in 2009, is accused of stabbing her life coach with a fork only six months after being arrested for choking her sober coach . A New York socialite and daughter of a wealthy real estate attorney is accused of stabbing her life coach with a fork in the second shocking attack against her hired help in months. Joselyn Wohl, 33, who was arrested for choking and pulling her sober coach down a set of stairs in December, allegedly this time left a fragment of a fork in her victim's hand. Sajjadur Rahman, 31, claims he was hired by Larry Wohl, Wohl's father, before her latest attack that came without warning while having dinner at the family's Southampton home. 'It was a defensive move. If he hadn’t gotten his hand up, she would have stabbed him in the face,' Rahman's attorney Eric Richmon told the New York Post. 'Without just cause or provocation, Joselyn Wohl intentionally struck, battered and assaulted,' Rahman writes in his filing obtained by the Post. Rahman says he was initially promised by Larry Wohl full compensation for his medical bills if he didn't go to the police. But with that yet to happen, 'he called me,' Richman said. He says Rahman's medical bills have tallied into the thousands of dollars and he's without work having to quit his job with the Wohl family out of fear for his life. Home sweet home: Both incidents are said to have occurred at Wohl's family's Hamptons home, pictured . Late last year Heather McKean filed a lawsuit against the Wohl family following a March 5th attack that left her so badly injured she has had to have a spinal fusion to help her recovery. McKean was hired by Joselyn's parents to help her with unspecified substance abuse issues. In the lawsuit, McKean alleged that Joselyn pulled McKean down a set of concrete stairs in the Wohl's Hamptons mansion. 'Joselyn wanted to go out and do something not in her best interest and Heather was trying to talk her down,' McKean's lawyer Bryan Swerling told The New York Post. 'Heather began to walk up the stairs. She felt a tug on the back of her shirt and it was Joselyn attacking her.' According to DNAinfo, McKean goes on to say that Joselyn continued the attack by choking her until she managed to break free and lock herself in a room. Family: Joselyn, seen on the right of parents Larry and Denise Wohl in 2006, faces a lawsuit against former sober coach Heather McKean and potentially soon Sajjadur Rahman as well . Once there, McKean called police who responded to the call, but they have not included their records of the incident as part of the lawsuit. McKean was hired by the family because of her work with Cerberus Life Management, a company that deals with addiction treatment. The company has no known connection to the private equity firm of the same name, which is now tied into the Sandy Hook massacre coverage due to their financial ties to a popular gun manufacturer. The specifics about the lawsuit have remained underwraps, as McKean's lawyer only said that she was seeking unspecified damages. She reportedly needs physical therapy for leg and spinal cord injuries. The Wohls have not released any public statements about the lawsuit.","Latest claims against Joselyn Wohl, 33, follows an arrest in December  for allegedly choking her sober coach and pulling her down the stairs .

Florida senator Marco Rubio has been tirelessly promoting a bipartisan deal on immigration legislation, saying today that the bill doesn’t ‘give anything away.’ ‘We’re not awarding anything,’ Sen. Rubio, a Republican who is among the ‘Gang of Eight’ senators writing the plan expected to come out Tuesday, said Sunday morning on ABC News’ ‘This Week.’ Sen. Rubio, a Cuban-American himself, insisted that the plan does not give any hand-outs, adding: ‘All we’re doing is giving people the opportunity to eventually earn access to our new, improved and modernized legal immigration system.' Scroll down for videos . Reform: Florida senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, spoke out today about his immigration reform bill; Rubio is one of the so-called 'Gang of Eight' who has tirelessly worked on the legislation . Making the rounds: Rubio also spoke today on NBC's 'Meet the Press' During his time on ‘This Week,’ Sen. Rubio also slammed ‘de-facto amnesty,’ saying that just because an immigrant was in the country illegally or overstayed their visa doesn’t mean they should automatically become U.S. citizens. He was also careful to say that some people currently in the country simply will not qualify under these newer, stricter laws, meaning that some of the 11 million illegal immigrants in question are riding a wave of uncertainty. ‘The only thing you are earning here is an opportunity to apply for temporary status, and ultimately, potentially to apply for a green card, the way everybody else does,’ he said. ‘And that’s the process that we are ou . tlining.’ The Florida senator, who is considered to be an integral part of the bill, also spoke Sunday on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ today. ‘What we have now isn’t good for anybody,’ he said. ‘What we have in place today, the status quo, is horrible for America.’ Gang of Eight: In a photo from January, Sen. Rubio, center, is pictured with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., in Washington . Hot button issue: People flocked to Washington over the weekend for the 'Rally for Citizenship,' where tens of thousands of immigrants and their supporters rallied for immigration reform . But even among his fellow Republicans, there are serious doubts. 'I'm not convinced,' Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, said on ‘The Week.’ Havana high: Sen. Rubio blasted rapper Jay-Z, right, about his recent trip to Cuba . Sen. Marco Rubio says entertainers Beyonce and Jay-Z missed a chance while in Cuba to see firsthand the effects of political oppression. The Republican lawmaker from Florida calls their recent trip 'hypocritical' and he takes issue with the U.S. government's approval of the visit as a cultural mission. Beyonce and Jay-Z marked their wedding anniversary in Havana last week. 'I think Jay-Z needs to get informed,' he said on 'This Week,' calling the rapper's trip to the island country. U.S. citizens aren't allowed to travel to Cuba for mere tourism, though they can obtain licenses for academic, religious, journalistic or cultural exchange trips. These people-to-people licenses were reinstated under the Obama administration. Rubio, a Cuban-American, says such trips provide money to the Castro government to oppress the Cuban people. Rubio discussed the trip during interviews Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union,' ABC's 'This Week' and NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 'I know Sen. Rubio's heart is exactly right. And I really respect the work of the “Gang of Eight.” But they have produced legislation ... that will give amnesty now, legalize everyone that's here effectively today and then there's a promise of enforcement in the future.' Sen. Rubio said he would abandon the overhaul effort if enforcement, border security and other elements are softened to his dissatisfaction. With an eye on a possible White House run in 2016, the Florida congressman has been careful not to appear weak on border security or create political problems among the conservatives who have great sway in picking the GOP's nominee. Sen. Rubio also told those immigrants that it would perhaps be easier if they returned to their home countries and started the process from scratch rather than use the process he is proposing. 'So I would argue that the existing law is actually more lenient, that going back and waiting 10 years is going to be cheaper and faster that going through this process that we are outlining,' he said. Other lawmakers helping to write the legislation acknowledged the political challenges of the issue. 'A lot of my conservative colleagues have significant questions and they're legitimate,' said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. 'This is the start of a process, this is a vehicle that requires hearings, requires input and we welcome all of that. ... I am guardedly optimistic that we will see finally the end of this long, long trek that a lot of us have been on for many years.' The measure would put millions who are in the U.S. illegally on a 13-year path to citizenship, while toughening border security requirements, mandating that all employers check the legal status of workers, and allowing tens of thousands of new high- and low-skilled workers into the country with new visa programs. The legislation is expected to include a new emphasis on merit-based immigration over family ties.'This is a very balanced bill. The American people have told us to do two things: one, prevent future flows of illegal immigration; and then, come up with a common-sense solution for legal immigration. And that's what our bill does,' said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York. The senator also appeared on ' CBS' 'Face the Nation,' CNN's 'State of the Union', and 'Fox News Sunday'.' He also was booked on the Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision. Sessions and Schumer were on ABC while Sen. John McCain appeared on CNN. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

During her 1950’s heyday, Patricia McCormick stood out not only because she was a woman but her skills and bravery quickly gained her a reputation as a very talented fighter. ‘Had she not been born a woman,’ a rival and one of Mexico’s elite matadors told Sports Illustrated in 1963, ‘she might have been better than any of us.’ Scroll down for video . Patricia McCormick, the first American woman to become a professional bullfighter, has died at the age of 83 . During her 10 year career McCormick received top billing in stadiums from Mexico to South America . Her career started in 1951 and over the next decade she performed in hundreds of bullfights, receiving top billing in stadiums from Mexico to South America. She received top billing and drew thousands of fans. One bullfighting critic called her 'the most courageous woman I have ever seen.' While her talents and bravery was admired by her male counterparts, it was they who prevented her from advancing and she remained a novillera, or apprentice fighter. Progress to a higher rank would have required the sponsorship of a matador and none were prepared to do that for a woman. While her talents and bravery was admired by her male counterparts, they also prevented her from advancing . The discrimination she received didn’t stop her from demanding to be treated equally, she always insisted on fighting large bulls and on foot, rather than horseback. Injuries were not uncommon, she was gored on six occasions and in 1954 she nearly died after a bull caught her on the thigh. ‘The horn went right up my stomach,’ she told The Los Angeles Times in 1989. ‘The bull carried me around the ring for a minute, impaled on his horns.’ ‘They gave me the last rites there,' she recalled. 'The doctor said, ""Carry her across the border and let her die in her own country.'"" She was introduced to bullfighting as a 7-year-old during a family vacation to Mexico City, then when her family moved to West Texas she began crossing the border into Juárez to watch fights. McCormick was gored on six occasions and in 1954 she nearly died after a bull caught her on the thigh . Eventually she quit college for bullfighting, persuading a retired matador to be her mentor. Her debut was in 1951 in Juárez. and twice the bull trampled her and tossed her with its horns before she plunged the estoque between its shoulders. Afterwards the crowd showered her with roses, and she was awarded the bull’s ear for impressing with her skills. After killing the animal, Ms. McCormick, streaked in blood, knelt down and stroked its head. ‘I loved the brave bull,’ she later wrote in ‘Lady Bullfighter,’ her memoir. She quit in 1962 moved to California, where she wanted to be an artist and worked as a secretary. She drew thousands of fans and one bullfighting critic called her 'the most courageous woman I have ever seen' By the early 2000s she had returned to Texas, but was experiencing money problems and was set to lose her home. A man who had been a fan of Ms McCormick as a young child helped her out and encouraged her to use her fame to help her make some money. Her relationship with Gary Humphreys eventually soured when she sued him and he settled out of court. In 2006, Ms. McCormick was honored by Ciudad Acuña at its annual Running las Vacas event. In 2007, the Heritage Museum of Big Spring mounted an exhibition on her life and career and invited her to demonstrate her cape work. People waited two hours in line to meet her.

The official launch of the Walking With The Wounded polar challenge will be held this week and even though the 28-year-old prince has not yet publicly spoken about taking part it is thought he may join the participants because he is also a patron of the charity. In March 2011, he joined an amputee team which trekked to the North Pole alongside Captain Disney, 30, who lost his right leg in battle. Expedition: Prince Harry takes down his tent during the Walking With the Wounded trip to the North Pole . Captain Disney told The Telegraph: 'I know he'd want to be involved. He's a soldier - of course he'd love to do this. But first and foremost I'd like him to be there because he is a really good bloke.' Prince Harry, or Captain Wales as he is known in the military, was involved in a two-part documentary called Harry's Heroes which was filmed during the trip to the North Pole. He had to cut the expedition short because of his brother William's wedding. During the documentary he said: 'These guys have been to hell and back and come out the other side. 'They are amazing, absolutely astonishing; the inspiration they give to everyone is unbelievable.

One is my military life, one is my private life, one is the public stuff. But me as a military man is my number one favourite, because I get to spend time with people like this.' Prince Harry entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in May 2005. He successfully completed a 44-week training course as an Officer Cadet, before being commissioned in April 2006 as a Second Lieutenant in the Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals). In February 2008 he went on to complete more than two months service with the British Army in Helmand province, Afghanistan, as a Forward Air Controller for NATO forces and was promoted from Second Lieutenant to Lieutenant in April 2008. In January 2009 he began a two-and-a-half year training course to become a fully operational, full-time Army Air Corps helicopter pilot. He remains an officer in the Household Cavalry during the training period. The expedition will take place as a race between a British team, a U.S. team and a team representing the Commonwealth countries Canada and Australia. Following extensive training, from cold weather training in Iceland in March, to team training through the summer and a final session of snow preparation in October, the teams will fly to Antartica in November. They aim to reach the South Pole around December 17. In a statement released ahead of Friday's launch, Prince Harry said: 'Walking With The Wounded continues to champion our extraordinary wounded service personnel and highlight their determination and courage to face future challenges following injury on the battlefield, whether physical or cognitive. 'Their inspirational expeditions have already impacted so many and I hope they will continue to impact many more. 'I am delighted to be Patron of the Allied South Pole Challenge, their latest ambitious project. Not only will this involve wounded personnel from the United Kingdom, but there will be a team from the United States and a team from the Commonwealth. This means the awareness created will be global, and will not only show the tenacity of these young men and women, but also the strong links between our Allies, off the battlefield as well as on. 'The Allied Challenge in 2013 promises to be a quite remarkable endeavour. I urge everyone to get behind the expedition and ‘Support the Walk’.

The world's tallest statue of former pontiff Pope John Paul II has been unveiled today in Poland. Businessman Leszek Lyson funded the 45ft statue in gratitude to Pope John Paul II because he believes the former pope intervened in saving his son from drowning during a family holiday in Croatia in 2010. The statue, which weighs five tonnes and is made of white fibreglass, shows the pope standing with outstretched arms with a gold cross around his neck.

The 45ft statue of John Paul II is thought to be the tallest in the world, trumping a 40ft model in Chile . The monument stands on a hill above the city of Czestochowa, famous for the Jasna Gora monastery, and its icon of the Black Madonna  which is believed to work miracles.

He visiited 120 . countries in a 27-year pontificate and became known as a freedom fighter. In 2005 he died aged 84after a long illness. In 2011 he was was beatified - the penultimate step towards sainthood - after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints attributed a mircale to him. At the unveiling ceremony an actor read fragments of texts written by the late pope, who died in 2005, before a children's choir sang.

In Poland 90 per cent of the 38 million population are Catholic, making it one of Europe's most devout countries.

In this sexy, glamorous, yet totally appropriate outfit, Pippa gives us a masterclass on how to dress for a winter wedding. (Yes, we know it’s supposed to be spring, it’s just that Aberdeenshire, where her friends Edmund Salvesen and Abi Elphinstone tied the knot on Saturday, obviously hadn’t got the memo). I don’t think I’ve seen her look this stylish since Kate and William’s big day. The sleek lines and split of her £578 floor-length, silk Beulah frock flatter her toned legs – and that derrière – while the fluffy tippet adds drama and keeps out the chill. Sloanes seem to wed at a rate of knots, so it’s no wonder Pippa recycled the stole, which she wore to another winter wedding, in December 2012. Opinion is divided as to whether it’s real or fake fox, but if it is faux, it’s extremely convincing. Fur has been all over the catwalk recently, so Pippa’s obviously been paying attention. The jaunty Gina Foster cocktail hat is a winner too. I love the elegant feather, which is much more stylish than the overblown silk flowers she’s favoured in the past. The purple dress makes her olive complexion glow, although it could be argued that the matching bangle, clutch bag and suede Prada court shoes are overkill. She looks sexy, radiant and grown-up – yet not old beyond her years, which is a fashion trap she’s fallen into in the past. She and her mother, Carole, have often been snapped in very similar outfits, which look great on Middleton Senior, but can make 29-year-old Pippa look rather too Sloaney and staid. No chance of that in this foxy ensemble.","The Duchess of Cambridge's sister channeled a 1920s style for occasion .

Supermarkets have sparked a forecourt price-war by slashing up to 4p a litre at the pumps. Motoring groups welcomed the cuts - worth up to £2 per fill-up - but said that the supermarkets had been until now trailing rivals who'd already started undercutting them over the past fortnight ago. The price-cut moves by Sainsbury, Asda and Tesco also came as campaigners urge the Chancellor ahead of next week's Budget to abandon a planned 3p a litre hike planned for September - or even announce a cut. Price battle: Sainsbury's has cut the cost of fuel from today, with Asda and Tesco following suit . Sainsbury's sparked the price war by announcing that from today petrol prices at the company's 279 forecourts will dip by 4p a litre, with diesel being reduced by 3p a litre. Asda then responded by announcing it would be cutting its petrol by up to 3p a litre and its diesel by up to 2p a litre, adding that drivers would pay no more than 134.7p a litre for petrol and 141.7p a litre for diesel. And Tesco then jumped in with a 3p drop at its 496 forecourts. Latest petrol price figures show the cost of filling up is continuing to put the squeeze on motorists, going up by another 5p a litre in February alone. This increase added £2.50 to the cost of a typical 50-litre refill, or £3.50 to fill up a Ford Mondeo. A family with two petrol cars is now spending £10.62 a month more on fuel than at the beginning of the year. Average UK petrol prices stand at . around 137,08p a litre, following a surge that started in the second . week of January when the price was 132.01p. Since the start of 2013, diesel pump prices have increased from around 140p a litre to 143.96p. The AA welcomed the move. AA head of public affairs Paul Watters said:'This is a substantial fall, worth £2 a tank of petrol, and fairly reflects the drop in wholesale costs which started in late February. 'However, many non-supermarket fuel stations started undercutting supermarket prices a fortnight ago.' He said: 'Drivers will very much welcome Sainsbury's move which gives respite after the third 8p-or-more pump price surge in the past 12 months. 'The response of other supermarkets, hopefully passing on the full drop in wholesale costs and not just where they feel they need to, will dictate the extent of this potential boost to family budgets.' On the rise: The graph shows how prices had dropped in the final months of 2912 but have jumped again in January and February . Whitewash? The Office of Fair Trading said sharp rises in fuel prices was caused by increases in tax and not price-fixing by oil companies . In January motoring groups accused the Office of . Fair Trading of ‘a whitewash’ yesterday after the watchdog ruled out a . full inquiry into petrol prices. The OFT, which launched a probe last year, claimed there was no evidence drivers were being ripped off. For years motorists have complained that pump prices soar when the price of crude oil rises, but fail to drop if it then falls. George Osborne is coming under mounting pressure to order a fuel duty freeze in this month’s Budget, as experts warned prices were spiralling out of control. Pressure: George Osborne is being advised to freeze duty on fuel as experts warn prices are going to soar . Tory MPs are urging the Chancellor to cancel a 3p-a-litre rise in fuel duty planned for September. Motoring organisations warned that families could not take much more, following a 6p rise in fuel prices since the start of the year. Conservative MP Robert Halfon has dubbed fuel duty a ‘toxic tax’ and said action to bring it under control was now more important than raising the income tax threshold, which has been the Coalition’s top tax priority. ‘This Government has . done more than almost any other in recent times to reduce the cost of . fuel but we need to go further... in the long term, when the financial . conditions allow, to actually cut fuel duty,' he said. ‘When . fuel duty goes up it’s not just a tax on fuel because food prices go . up, bus prices go up, it crushes businesses, it crushes families, it’s a . disincentive to work because people can’t afford to drive to work.’ Last week it emerged that the poorest car owners are being forced to shell out more than a quarter of their ready cash to keep a vehicle on the road. Typically, a poor household will spend £44 a week on motoring expenses out of a total seven-day budget of £167, according to the RAC Foundation. Of this, a total of £16 is used to buy petrol or diesel and £8.30 goes on insurance. This means the most hard-up 10 per cent of car-owning households are having to put at least 27 per cent of their disposable income towards owning and running a vehicle. Rising costs: The average 5p a litre increase in February added £2.50 to the cost of a typical 50-litre refill . By contrast, motoring costs only represent about 12 per cent of the disposable income of the wealthiest car-owning households. RAC Foundation director Stephen Glaister said: 'These figures should shock Chancellor George Osborne, with some households mired in transport poverty. 'We already knew transport was the single biggest area of household expenditure bar none. But this spending breakdown just for car-owning households is not normally available. It lays bare the truth about the extent of transport poverty in the UK.'","Sainsbury's announced reductions first before Asda and Tesco followed suit .

Contrary to popular belief, it's not just smokers who get it. One in eight in people who get the disease will never have smoked and it can strike at any age. People who have never smoked or have been light smokers may have other risk factors, such as  passive smoking, exposure to asbestos and other chemicals, a poor diet and a family history of lung cancer. If caught in the early stages, the five-year survival rate is 80 per cent. If allowed to spread, that figure drops to seven per cent.

A teenager has grown an incredible five inches overnight after an operation to straighten his spine. Harvey Legge, 14, was suffering from scoliosis, or curvature of the spine - and the bend was so severe it was crushing his vital organs. He was referred to a paediatrician at . Sheffield Children’s hospital who said his case was so severe he would . have to have surgery. The operation saw him grow five inches overnight, taking him from 4'10"" to 5'3"". His spine has gone from being at a 90 degree angle, to just a 20 degree angle. Twisted: Harvey Legge, 14, was suffering from scoliosis, or curvature of the spine. The bend was so severe it was crushing his vital organs . His mother Claire Walker, 39, said: ‘It really is wonderful to see. He now stands as tall as me - he literally grew five inches overnight after the operation once surgeons had straightened out his spine. ‘To see the X-rays of his spine before and after the operation really is remarkable. The surgeons have done a wonderful job.’ Mrs Walker, from Holton Le Clay, Lincolnshire, said: ‘It was a shock when . he was first diagnosed with it. 'I’d noticed that his rib cage didn’t . look level when he bent down, but I had no idea that it was anything as . serious as scoliosis. ‘When I was told he would have to have surgery to correct it, I was devastated. But I knew that it was the only option for him. ‘The bend in his spine was so severe . that it was crushing all his organs. His rib cage was banging on his hip . and he used the other hip as a shelf to rest his arm. He couldn’t walk . very far because he was so twisted.’ The operation saw him grow five inches overnight, taking him from 4'10"" to 5'3"". His spine has gone from being at a 90 degree angle, to just a 20 degree angle. Doctors decided that because Harvey's case . was so severe, they couldn’t wait any longer to operate on him. Mrs Walker said: ‘We knew that he was very young to have this operation and it was nerve-wracking, but there was no choice. ‘Two months previously we had been on . holiday to Italy and while we were sat around the pool, people were . watching Harvey with their jaws dropping open. He was very conscious . about what he looked like, too.’ Doctors warned the couple that there was . a risk of paralysis with the operation, but they knew it was Harvey’s . only chance as he was being suffocated by his own spine. But complications from the operation left surgeons fearing Harvey was brain dead after he lost his entire body’s worth of blood. He has since made a full recovery . The eight hour operation was carried out . in November 2011 at Sheffield Children’s Hospital, where doctors put . titanium rods either side of his spine to straighten it. But complications from the operation left surgeons fearing he was brain dead after he lost his entire body’s worth of blood and his brain shut down. Mrs Walker said: 'It was terrifying when he lost so much blood - we thought we were going to lose him. Harvey spent nine days recovering in hospital, and then a further three months recovering at home. Mrs . Walker added: ‘It was so amazing when he stood up and he was so much . taller. He had always been the smallest in his class and now he is of . average height which is great. Standing tall: Harvey with his mother Clare and surgeon Ashley Cole. He had always been the smallest in his class but is now of average height . ‘He can now do contact sports and he can run too. He won’t grow any more, but it is fantastic that he is now so much taller than he was. Ashley Cole, the consultant spinal surgeon who performed Harvey’s operation said: ‘It was a huge success and Harvey has recovered fantastically well. ‘We had to do the surgery much sooner with Harvey than many other children because his condition was progressing at such a fast rate.’","Harvey Legge, 14, was suffering from scoliosis, or curvature of the spine .

An elderly patient was left for three days in a hospital without being seen by a doctor, an inquest has heard. Walter Coles, 88, was 'substantially overlooked' and senior doctors were unaware of his arrival. Dubbed 'the invisible man' by the coroner, he died at Wycombe Hospital, Buckinghamshire, on 9 July 2012. Mr Coles been transferred there from Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury, three days earlier. Walter Coles died at Wycombe Hospital, Buckinghamshire, last summer. His care was 'substantially overlooked' and senior doctors were unaware of his arrival, an inquest heard . The inquest heard that a catalogue of errors occurred with Mr Coles' care. As well as not being seen by a doctor, registrars were not told of his move and his medication chart went missing - before being filled out again by a doctor who hadn't examined him. Coroner Richard Hulett ruled that Mr Coles, of Quainton, Buckinghamshire, died of natural causes, but added the 88-year-old had been 'substantially overlooked' while he was under the care of Wycombe Hospital. And he said the lack of evidence over what had happened was 'verging on the useless' for staff tasked with investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr Coles' death. Mr Coles did not arrive until around midnight of Friday 6 into Saturday 7 July, but Dr Thomas Chapman, the on-call registrar, was not told of his admission - which meant protocol to have him medically reviewed was not carried out. Dr Chapman told Beaconsfield Coroner's Court: 'I can be absolutely certain I wasn't informed of his arrival. It could have been escalated to night manager or the consultant on call. There's no record of that.' The registrar on-call during the day, who was unable to be identified, knew of Mr Coles' imminent transfer but went off duty at 5pm and neglected to tell the person replacing them. This meant news of his arrival was not subsequently passed on to Dr Chapman. Mr Coles had been transferred from the Stoke Mandeville Hospital . Mr Hulett said: 'There's no evidence the appropriate doctor at Wycombe on the late afternoon shift knew Mr Coles was coming. 'There was a responsibility for the nurses in charge to report this late arrival to the duty registrar. That didn't take place.' At some point on Saturday Mr Coles' drug chart went missing and a replacement was produced by Dr Thomas Morgan based on his medical notes. But Mr Hulett said: 'He never saw the patient, never reviewed him at all and never raised the question, ""Has anybody looked at this patient?"".' Nurse Faith Tamangani told the inquest she could recall having a telephone conversation with a doctor about Mr Coles but could not remember who she spoke to, nor could she recall reporting his arrival to Dr Chapman. As well as not being seen by a doctor, registrars were not told of Mr Coles' move and his medication chart went missing (stock photo) Mr Hulett said in his summing up that 'record keeping and communication were poor' and the doctor referred to by Nurse Tamangani was 'not identified and completely unidentifiable'. He added: 'What was recorded was verging on the useless - it made impossible for those who came to enquire to identify the doctor and say to that doctor, ""Why did nobody do anything or attend the patient?""' The coroner recorded Mr Coles died of natural causes but added: 'Although he does succumb to this and he does die of a medical cause, he becomes the invisible man of that ward. 'The fact somebody died and would have done so is no excuse for being substantially overlooked while they are in an NHS hospital.' Lynne Swiatczak, Chief Nurse and Director of Patient Care Standards with Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, said after Wednesday's inquest: 'We would like to express our deepest sympathies to the family of Mr Coles. 'We carried out a thorough investigation into Mr Coles' care, which identified that standard Trust processes were not always followed. 'We have taken, and continue to take, action to strengthen the processes we have in place, including documentation and re-training staff on record-keeping and communication. The coroner indicated that lessons had been learned at the Trust since Mr Coles' death. 'We will take the time to reflect on what was said at the inquest. While Mr Coles died of natural causes, as reported by the coroner, we will of course consider what further action we can take to learn from this. 'The Trust is committed to providing excellent patient care and ensuring patient safety.'","Walter Coles, 88, was transferred to Wycombe Hospital last summer .

Microsoft is developing a smaller version of its Surface tablet with a 7inch screen, it has been claimed. The tablet is expected to go on sale later this year, and will go head to head with Apple's iPad Mini, Google's Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire in the lucrative small tablet market. It is hoped the devices could reverse the disappointing sales of the larger Surface tablet which Microsoft launched this year. The Surface tablet was unveiled earlier this year to a lukewarm reception - Now Microsoft is believed to be developing a smaller version to take on Apple's iPad mini . Samsung's new Galaxy Mega has a 6.3-inch HD screen - although the firm claims it is 'ultra-thin and portable enough to put into your pocket.' The Mega comes with an enhanced 8 megapixel rear-facing camera with a 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera, and runs Google Android software. 'The software giant is developing a new lineup of its Surface tablets, including a 7-inch version expected to go into mass production later this year,', The Wall Street Journal said people familiar with the company's plans had claimed. It claims the 7-inch tablets weren't part of the company's strategy last . year, but Microsoft executives realized they needed a response to the . rapidly growing popularity of smaller tablets like Google 7-inch Nexus, . which was announced last summer, and the 7.9-inch iPad Mini introduced . by Apple last October, along with Amazon's Fire HD. Seperate reports have specualted the new tablet could be designed primarily as a games and media device, and be branded as an 'Xbox tablet' to accompany Microsoft's hugely successful games console. It comes amid growing concern for the future of the PC industry as consumers move towards tablets. PC sales have have gone into freefall with a 14 per cent drop last year - the biggest slump in history. HP, the world's largest PC maker, saw the sharpest decline with 24 per cent fewer machines sold in 2012 compared to 2011. Dell also saw an 11 per cent slump and even Apple, which saw a seven per cent fall, was unable to buck the trend. Research firm IDC said it was the biggest decline overall since it began began tracking this data in 1994. Analysts . said that ‘the days seem to be numbered for the humble PC’ and that in . the future we would all be using portable devices. Even . the launch of Windows 8 failed to stop the trend with some saying the . negative response to the software may have exacerbated the trend. PC . makers have in recent years tried a string of innovations to breathe . life into the market including Ultrabooks which were poorly received. How the competition stacks up . Experts say the success of the iPad and smartphone has led to the slump in PC sales, with people preferring gadgets they can carry with them . Windows 8 was also criticised for making too many changes and getting rid of the iconic start button. The figures show that the late Apple founder Steve Jobs’ prediction that we are headed for a ‘post-PC era’ is coming true. Bob . O’Donnell, program vice president for clients and displays at IDC, said . that what he called the ‘radical changes’ made to the PC in recent . years had done it more harm than good. He . said: ‘At this point, unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 . launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but . appears to have slowed the market. ‘Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market’. Microsoft also came under fire for the slump, with critics saying its Windows 8 software confused users . Some 350 million personal computers are sold each year, but the numbers are nothing compared to more portable options. Some 919 million smartphones will be sold this year and 200 million tablets, taking their total comfortably over one billion. Research firm Gartner also released similar figures which showed a 11 per cent decline in PC sales, the biggest drop since 2001. The company has already predicted that by 2017 the main operating system for all computing devices will be Google’s Android. Marcus Jewell of tech company Brocade said: ‘The days seem to be numbered for the humble PC’.","Smaller version of the firm's Surface tablet expection to go on sale later this year .

While Google can’t answer what happens to you when you die, it’s trying to account for what happens to your online persona. The search engine giant has released its ‘Inactive Account’ settings page, which allows a Google user to clarify what they want done with their YouTube, Gmail, and Google+ accounts after they die or are otherwise unable to use their account. Users can choose to have their data deleted after three, six, or twelve months of inactivity. To the cloud: Google has introduced its 'Inactive Account Manager' tool that allows users to chose when to delete their data from Gmail, Blogger, and other Google accounts . Google product manager Andreas Tuerk wrote in an accompanying public policy blog post that it is important to plan for the worst. ‘Not many of us like thinking about death – especially our own,’ he writes. ‘But making plans for what happens after you’re gone is really important for the people you leave behind.’ He acknowledged the name, ‘Inactive Account Manager,’ is ‘not a great’ one; some techies have already colloquially named it the ‘Death Account Manager.’ In the post, Tuerk explains how Google users can implement the service. First, they select how long their account is inactive – up to a year – before all of their data is deleted. Google will also issue a warning a month before data in one’s account is deleted. For most people, the service comes as welcome, if not somber, news, as it provides a buffer for information from emails, Gchats, phone calls, and blog posts to stay out of the wrong hands. Similarly, users can pick and choose which services they want to send to other people, from Blogger, to YouTube, Picasa Web Albums, and contacts. Passwords will not be passed on to loved ones. Protected: Data from Google services like GMail, Google+, Blogger, and Picasa can be programed to be deleted after a set time of inactivity . A spokesman for Google told TechCrunch that in a conflicting situation – say, when a family member or interested person wanted to look at the Google account of the deceased, the company ‘will honor the preference you’ve made in Inactive Account Manager to the extent permitted by the law.’ As a policy, Facebook does not give out passwords of users in the event that person died. Rather, accounts are ‘memorialized,’ meaning that only confirmed friends can view their profile information. Commenters on the public policy blog gave a largely positive response to the service. One user wrote: ‘I always thought about this… And Google has the solution ready. Keep coming (up with) such great tools.’ Another commenter cheekily wrote: ‘Love this. Can you let me post from the grave as well?’","Google unveiled 'Inactive Account Settings' Thursday as way for users to program data deletion .

During a press conference Friday, officials in West Allis said twin 4-year-old boys and a 5-year-old girl died in the house fire Thursday. According to local authorities, there was no adult in the home at the time the fire ignited and that the mother is now being questioned in connection to the tragedy. Deadly inferno: Three young children ages 4 and 5 were killed when a fire erupted inside this West Allis, Wisconsin, home, while their mother was away .

Picking up the pierces: Fire investigators stand on the porch of a West Allis, Wis., home where a fire killed three children . Agents from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the state Department of Justice are investigating the case. The fire erupted inside a home at 7750 West Hicks Street at around 5.20pm Thursday. First responders arrived on the scene three minutes after getting a 911 call and discovered the two-story residence engulfed in flames and filled with thick black smoke. Once firefighters extinguished the inferno and secured the scene, they entered the house, where they discovered the bodies of three young children in a second-floor bedroom. Acting Police Chief Chuck Padgett said autopsies will be performed on the victims to determine the exact cause of death. ‘The City of West Allis is mourning this loss of life and the mourning is intensified by the fact that they were children,’ said West Allis Mayor Dan Devine during a news conference on Thursday.

Ever since the first bride appeared in an over-sized crystal-embellished dress, viewers of Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding have been wondering exactly where the Travelling community finds the funds to pay for them. Now, their questions are to be answered in a new documentary, My Big Fat Gypsy Fortune, which reveals the secrets of the Traveller economy and explains how the system has produced some of the very poorest people in society as well as some of the richest. The show, which goes out on Sunday night, follows two very different members of the Traveller community, starting with 15-year-old Romany Gypsy, Alfie Best, whose father, also called Alfie, is worth more than £100 million.

Graft: Fellow Romany George Webb appeared on the X Factor but has to sell door-to-door and collect scrap . Despite his wealth, Alfie has already left school on the grounds that 'a man has to make his own way in the world' and has become a door-to-door paint salesman, albeit with the help of a chauffeur. At the other end of the income scale is fellow Romany and former X-Factor wannabe George Webb, who lives in a tiny caravan and has to 'graft' for every penny he gets. Webb, who made the news for all the wrong reasons when he was given 200 hours of community service after admitting five counts of fraud in 2011, has, like Alfie, turned to 'hawking' or selling door-to-door to keep himself going. Despite making heavy weather of teaching 10 Gypsy apprentices to create her spectacular wedding gowns in her own spin-off show, Thelma's Gypsy Girls, dressmaker Thelma Madine also appears on the show to explain why gypsies are being unfairly maligned. 'This misconception about all Travellers being on the dole is the biggest load of c*** I've ever heard,' says the straight-talking Scouser. 'All . these men are self employed. They don't work for anybody else. Even if . they're going round getting scrap and doing things like that... jobs . that we probably don't want to do!'

'And that should land me short of the flag and not have it either hit the flag or skip over the back. I felt that was going to be the right decision to take off four (yards) right there. And I did. It worked out perfectly.' It was that statement that launched a firestorm of uproar, and on Saturday led to a 2-stroke penalty by the Masters committee. 'He should really sit quietly with whoever he trusts, [long-time agent] Mark Steinberg, a few others, maybe Lindsey [Vonn, his girlfriend] as well, and sit and just go, ""wow, I would be doing the manly thing to go, I have broken the rules of golf,""' Faldo told the Golf Channel on Saturday. 'There is some leeway with the signing the incorrect (score) card. Not with . intentionally not dropping as near as possible,' Tweeted David Duval, a former World Number One golfer. It was a television viewer who brought Woods’ illegal drop on the 15th hole to officials' attention, which would have been otherwise missed, according to a statement by Augusta National. Sunk: Woods reacts after the ball went into the water on the 15th hole, a trap that gave him three options to wiggle out of, one he's said to have illegally performed . While Woods was on the 18th hole, officials consequently reviewed footage of his drop before announcing their decision - a pardoning one. 'The penalty of disqualification was waived by the Committee under Rule 33 as the Committee had previously reviewed the information and made its initial determination prior to the finish of [Woods’] round,' Fred Ridley, the committee's chairman said. According to USGA Rule 33-7: ‘A penalty of disqualification may in exceptional individual cases be waived, modified or imposed if the committee such action warranted. If a Committee considers that a player is guilty of a serious breach of etiquette, it may impose a penalty of disqualification under this Rule.’ The committee issued him a 2-stroke . penalty on Saturday morning Woods says strictly because of his interview . on Friday that appeared to express his admission of knowing wrong . doing. Leader: Jason Day of Australia, seen during the second round of the 2013 Masters Tournament, starts the third round on Saturday 6 under . On Saturday, roughly an hour before teeing off, Woods released the following statement claiming he didn't realize he was so detrimentally far from his original place before taking that shot. ‘I didn’t know I had taken an incorrect drop prior to signing my scorecard,’ Woods tweeted. ‘Subsequently, I met with the Masters Committee Saturday morning and was advised they had reviewed the incident prior to the completion of my round. 'Their initial determination was that there was no violation, but they had additional concerns based on my post-round interview. After discussing the situation with them this morning, I was assessed a two-shot penalty. I understand and accept the penalty and respect the Committee' decision.' Round three: Woods, right, is seen putting on the practice green before the third round on Saturday afternoon after assessed a 2-stroke penalty by the rules committee for the drop on Friday . Playing fair: Woods, seen on Saturday, started the year with a rules violation after taking relief from an imbedded lie in a sandy area covered with vines in Abu Dhabi which was determined not allowed in the sand . Woods will begin 5 strokes behind leader Jason Day on Saturday afternoon, who's 6 under. The revision to Rule 33 was based upon the modern era of television. One example cited was Padraig Harrington, who opened with a 65 in Abu Dhabi at the start of the 2011 season. Harrington was disqualified when a slow-motion replay on high-definition TV revealed that his ball moved ever so slightly after he replaced his marked. Harrington didn't realize it had moved - a two-shot penalty - and was disqualified for an incorrect card. That same year, Camilo Villegas was disqualified in Hawaii when a TV viewer noticed he tamped down a divot in an area where his chip was rolling back down a slope. Rule 33 would not have applied there because Villegas did not know the rule. Woods started the year with a rules violation. He took relief from an imbedded lie in a sandy area covered with vines in Abu Dhabi. It was determined that relief was not allowed in the sand. He was docked two shots before signing his card, and it caused him to miss the cut. Hunter Mahan summed up the mess on Twitter: ""If you think tiger should be dq'd your not wrong, if you think 2 shot penalty is enough your not wrong. Not sure the right answer.""","Masters Committee spared Woods' disqualification on Friday while believing he committed an honest mistake .

Drunks injured in booze-fuelled brawls should be charged for their NHS treatment, Nick Clegg said today. The Deputy Prime Minister revealed he backed the idea of imposing levies on people who get ‘completely blind drunk and gets themselves into a scrap’. An estimated two million visits are made to A&E every year for alcohol-related illnesses and injuries. Experts say the cost of alcohol to the NHS exceeds £3billion per year. Scroll down for video . Experts say the cost of alcohol to the NHS exceeds £3billion-a-year, with hundreds of thousands of visits to A&E departments . The government has already imposed new rules allowing police and councils to charge nightclubs and pubs a fee for the cost of policing town centres. Mr Clegg admitted some town and city centres have become ‘no-go areas’ in on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. He said it was unacceptable for the taxpayer to pick up the bill for the National Health Service to treat drunk patients whose injuries are self-inflicted. Mr Clegg said: ‘I’ve actually got quite a lot of sympathy with the basic  principle that says why should someone that goes out and gets completely  blind drunk,  behaves appallingly, gets themselves into  trouble and a scrap. ‘Why should other people always have to pick up the tab to help them out?’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was not fair for the taxpayer to pick up the bill for treating self-inflicted alcohol-related injuries . The Lib Dem leader was challenged over the costs to the health service during his weekly radio phone-in on LBC 97.3. A caller, Tony from Chislehurst, told him: ‘It seems to me a no-brainer - I don’t think you could lose a vote - if you were to make people responsible for the cost they occur if they go out and get blind drunk or have a fight and need stiches – it all comes to a cost. ‘Why can’t those costs be handed over to the people that incur them?’ Mr Clegg admitted the idea was ‘a bit tricky’ but revealed he supported the idea of charging people who repeatedly end up in casualty with alcohol-related injuries. ‘It’s quite difficult to do it but I actually think the principle you’re talking about is not entirely bad one. ‘Some-one who wilfully through their own actions basically creates a lot of trouble and hassle for the NHS which everyone else has to pay for, at some point you might want to say to them maybe not on the first occasion but… I don’t have the how but I do understand the why.’ The Home Office has already given councils the power to impose a late night levy on pubs and clubs to help with the costs of policing. Mr Clegg said it was right that landlords are made to 'cough up in order to deal with the problems they create'. He added: 'The rules have changed so that local authorities can get nightclubs and pubs and others where there is evidence that they are systematically turning a blind eye to the problem that they are creating that they have to chip in as well, for instance to shoulder some of the policing costs. 'That was something that I was very supportive of. You know what it’s like, there are parts of our towns and cities where frankly it can be a bit of a no-go area on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night. 'And I don’t see why people who create some of that problem shouldn’t shoulder some of the costs for dealing with the problems that they partly create.' Critics said many injuries were inflicted by other people who had been drinking. Eric Appleby, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, added most hospitals have alcohol liaison nurses, which helps cut admissions. The NHS faces a budget squeeze while trying to provide services like the London Ambulance Service's Booze Bus which pickis up people seriously affected by alcohol . Researchers last year said at least one in three patients seen in emergency departments because of drink then have to be admitted to hospital for further treatment. The study looked at adults seeking emergency care at Bristol Royal Infirmary over four weeks. Some 774 patients were asked  questions about their reasons for attending A&E and their average weekly alcohol consumption. Doctors were also asked whether the emergency was directly or indirectly related to alcohol, or was unrelated. Around one in five patients said  they had drunk alcohol before coming to A&E while 14 per cent felt their injury was related to drink. Of these, around half – 50 patients – believed they had been injured by someone who had been drinking, while a similar proportion had consumed more than the maximum recommended weekly units. Of the 111 patients who felt their attendance was related to alcohol, one in three was then admitted to hospital, the Emergency Medicine journal reports. Doctors said around one in five visits was related to alcohol, with one in ten blaming their visit on drink-related violence. Based on the findings, the researchers estimate alcohol may be involved in up to 640,000 hospital admissions and nearly two million visits to A&E in England and Wales each year. Figures from the NHS Information Centre earlier this month show there were 1,168,000 patients admitted to hospital as a result of alcohol in 2011 – up 11 per cent since 2010.","Deputy Prime Minister backs the idea of bills for alcohol-related injuries .

Senior investigators from the firm – ridiculed for the Olympics security fiasco – are even helping overworked officers on the Jimmy Savile sex abuse case. Retired detectives are earning more than £60,000 a year in their new roles, on top of lucrative gold-plated public sector pensions. Privatisation: Police forces are recruiting from G4S for roles running murder and serious crime probes . But the move has sparked fury among critics amid concerns that it is another step on the road to privatising frontline policing jobs. Many high-ranking officers have been forced to retire as police budgets are cut by 20 per cent by Home Secretary Theresa May. Police chiefs believe rehiring them as civilians ensures their experience and knowledge are not lost. But it has led to concerns about lack of oversight because hired civilian staff do not have to co-operate with the Independent Police . Reinforcements: The Government had to draft in additional security helpers from the Armed Forces after G4S failed to fulfill its contract for the Olympic Games . Complaints Commission, the organisation that probes grievances against the police. G4S – criticised by the Government last year after 3,500 extra troops had to be deployed at London 2012 to plug a gap in trained security staff – is advertising for 'senior investigating officers' to work with forces around Britain. The G4S File: The company has a history of blunders . Civilian officers will act as a 'focal point' heading serious crime investigations, leading teams of officers conducting interviews, door-to-door inquiries and tests. However, they could not arrest suspects and will not be allowed to lead a murder inquiry before someone has been taken into custody. Applicants must have managed murder or serious crime investigations up to the rank of detective inspector in the last four years. G4S's Policing Solutions division will pocket more than £250,000 to hire staff to work on Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the wake of the Savile paedophile and sex abuse scandal. The Met has a deal with a private firm, Reed Specialist Recruitment, which will pay G4S to hire retired detectives. They will work alongside 30 police officers in the Met's abuse unit. Former Met commander John O'Connor said: 'It's appalling that G4S is recruiting for an inquiry of such a personal and harrowing nature. It's madness and an insult to victims.' Other £30-an-hour jobs include a child abuse investigator to work  with Essex Police's specialist  unit in Laindon, near Basildon, and an intelligence co-ordinator in Hertfordshire. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We support police and crime commissioners and forces considering whether the private sector can help achieve savings and better services.'

Victory: Iain Duncan Smith's Department for Work and Pensions today announced 8,000 people had found work thanks to the benefit cap . One in four of those whose benefits . were due to be cut as a result of the Government’s cap on state handouts . have now found work. Figures from the Department of Work . and Pensions are the first concrete evidence that the crackdown on . welfare is encouraging people to ditch a life of dependency. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain . Duncan Smith said they proved his radical reform of the welfare system . ‘is having the desired impact’. From next Monday the Government will . impose an annual cap of £26,000 a year – £500 a week – on household . benefits in four London boroughs, with the scheme going nationwide in . September. Single people will see their benefits capped at £350 a week. Officials originally predicted that . 56,000 would see their benefits cut as a result of the cap, which is . pegged to the average earnings of those in work. But when the DWP wrote to those people . warning them that their taxpayer-funded handouts were set to be . trimmed, 16,000 of them decided to act. Some 8,000 potentially capped . claimants have now got jobs through Jobcentre Plus and another 8,000 of . them have dropped off the welfare rolls. Officials say the latter group are . likely to be working in the black economy and have decided to ditch . benefits rather than face scrutiny of their earnings. While ministers . are keen to crack down on the cash-in-hand culture, they are encouraged . that so many will no longer be claiming taxpayers’ money that they . don’t need. In total 25,000 of the 56,000 warned they would be hit have accepted help to find a job. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘The Benefit Cap . sets a strong incentive for people to move into work and even before . the cap comes in we are seeing thousands of people seeking help and . moving off benefits. Back to work: Jobcentre Plus has contacted those affected by the cap and helped them find employment . ‘We have a very clear message: we will . provide support to those who need it, but the days of outrageous claims . giving people incomes far above those of hard-working families are . over.’ He told the Mail: ‘We have to end the . crazy situation where people are worse off going to work. We need to . make going to work the default choice for people, give people an . incentive. ‘Already we’ve seen 8,000 people who . would have been affected by the cap move into jobs. This clearly . demonstrates that the cap is having the desired impact.’ He added: ‘Our Jobcentre Plus advisers . have been working closely for a year with people who will be affected . by the cap, including offering employment support to help people into . jobs. Outrage: The benefit cap is targeted at cases similar to those of Heather Frost, an unemployed mother of 11 who is having a £400,000 house built for her family at taxpayers' expense . ‘So far 25,000 people have taken up . our offers for help. We are engaging people who have never before . thought going to work was an option for them.’ The Government has exempted people on . disability benefits from the cap and those on widow’s pensions. Nor will . it apply if someone in the household is in work and claiming Working . Tax Credits. The statistics will give the Tories further ammunition in their battle with Labour in the run up to the 2015 general election. Ed Miliband’s party has opposed every . welfare cut made by the Coalition, but many in his own ranks are . concerned that Labour’s soft stance is alienating potential voters. Mr Duncan Smith told the Mail last . night: ‘The cap will limit benefit claims to the average salary of a . working household, at £500 a week. This is a fair amount. Fair to the . claimant and fair to the taxpayer. ‘Labour voted against the Benefit Cap. I am not clear whether it is giving people an incentive to work that Ed .

That is a question only Labour can answer.’","Government slashes estimates of how many people will face cap to 40,000 .

Labour heavyweights have piled further pressure on Ed Miliband to clarify his policies and stop protesting about everything the Government does. Three former Cabinet ministers – John Reid, David Blunkett and Tessa Jowell – yesterday urged the Labour leader to follow Tony Blair’s advice and offer a positive alternative for voters rather than simply criticising the status quo. Lord Reid, who held nine Cabinet posts, said Labour will not be ready for government until it spells out policies on key issues. Policies: Ed Miliband has tried to downplay Tony Blair's assertion that Labour has become a ‘repository for people’s anger’ ‘I think what [Mr Miliband] now has to do is to set out the direction of future Labour government on questions like welfare, on the economy, on housing and so on,’ he said. ‘The important thing is to recognise that, as you move from the politics of opposition to the politics of a potential government, that you have to be offering solutions and not just criticising the status quo.’ Lord Reid also dismissed the view of Mr Miliband and his guru Lord Wood of Anfield that the political centre ground is shifting to the Left. Mr Blair last week wrote a lengthy critique of the direction Mr Miliband has taken the party, warning that Labour has become a ‘repository for people’s anger’. But Mr Miliband dismissed the concerns saying his ‘One Nation Labour’ wants to look to the future not the past. In an article yesterday David Blunkett said Mr Blair and others were trying to provoke debate about the party’s future. In a Sky News interview the former home secretary said Labour would be ‘literally going nowhere’ if senior members could not voice their views. Mr Blunkett said: ‘We’ve got to have the confidence to be able to say where we’re going, not just a narrative about what the Government is doing.’ He added: ‘One Nation cannot and should never be simply the avoidance of the most obvious injustice or collective suicide. It has to be about a great deal more than politics built on grievance and the unhappiness of a resentful and selfish public sphere.’ Former culture secretary Dame Tessa Jowell said Tony Blair still had a lot to offer British politics and compared him to Bill Clinton. She said: ‘If it is simply a kind of combustible relationship where any intervention by Tony Blair is seen as unwelcome, unhelpful … then I think that is destructive. ‘If you take someone like Bill Clinton … he is a kind of honoured, experienced older statesman that still has value and currency … and I think exactly the same applies to the Labour party now and Tony Blair.’ A multi-millionaire former tax exile, who has pledged up to £1million to help Mr Miliband win the next election, said the Labour leader was ‘committed to making a difference’. Property magnate Andrew Rosenfeld gave £500,000 last year. The latest pledge could see him become  Labour’s biggest backer outside  the unions. Mr Rosenfeld made an estimated £100million before spending five years in Switzerland, a move he insists was for lifestyle reasons. While there, he paid Swiss taxes but not British capital gains or income tax. Mr Miliband has attacked ‘predatory’ capitalists, tax avoidance and the use of offshore tax havens, and acceptance of the money will lead to accusations of hypocrisy from  the Conservatives.

Len McCluskey, the militant trade union leader who is calling for a general strike, won re-election yesterday despite winning the backing of just 10 per cent of his members. Red Len, as he has been dubbed, reinforced his iron grip on Unite – the country’s biggest union – by winning 64 per cent of the votes cast. But in a dismal example of union democracy, just 15 per cent of the membership bothered to fill in a ballot. The election means Mr McCluskey can carry on rabble rousing for another five years until 2018. Just last week he was arguing for an ‘explicitly political strike’ across the trade union movement, which would be the first general strike since 1926. Mr McCluskey’s re-election is a headache for Ed Miliband, who has been unable to shake off the stigma of being picked by the unions contrary to the wishes of both Labour members and MPs. Unite have donated £8,425,166 to the Labour Party since Mr Miliband became leader in September 2010. Unite remains Labour’s single biggest donor, giving 32 per cent of donations in the last quarter. The vote comes as Frances O’Grady, the new head of the TUC, resurrected fears of 1970s and 1980s style militancy by refusing to back key union reforms that were introduced by the Thatcher government. Asked whether she supports secret ballots on strike action and the ban on closed shop, she flatly refused to do either. She added: ‘I’m not interested in re-running battles of the 70s but sorting out the mess that we’ve had as a result of unions being marginalised in society.’ Mrs O’Grady then made the extraordinary claim that ‘nobody took anybody out on strike without there being strong support, so I think it’s insulting to ordinary men and women to suggest otherwise’. In fact, Arthur Scargill’s failure to hold a secret strike ballot is widely regarded as fatally undermining  whatever public support there was for the miners’ strike in 1984-85. Unite have donated £8,425,166 to the Labour Party since Mr Miliband (left) became leader in September 2010. The vote comes as Frances O’Grady (right), the new head of the TUC, resurrected fears of militancy . But her intervention suggests even the usually cautious TUC is heading down a path of militancy. Yesterday Mr McCluskey said he was ‘deeply honoured that members have once again put their faith in me to lead their union’ and promptly vowed to bring down the Government. Tory chairman Grant Shapps cast doubt on Mr McCluskey’s credibility having won such a small number of votes. He said: ‘Union baron Len McCluskey’s been re-installed with the support of only a fraction of his membership, while Frances O’Grady wants to take us back to the bad old days of strikes without ballot. ‘We’re transforming the economy and removing 2.2million of the lowest paid workers from tax altogether – still, these union bosses remain completely unreformed.’ He said Mr McCluskey’s re-election ‘ensures Ed Miliband will remain clueless about dealing with the deficit’.","Len McCluskey won 64 per cent of the votes cast reinforcing his grip on the union Unite .

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has landed in China to seek its help in reining in its ally North Korea, which has threatened thermonuclear war on South Korea and America. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for peace, dialogue and denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula during today's talks, according to the country's state-run news agency Xinhua. Mr Kerry arrived in Beijing today to persuade Chinese leaders to exert pressure on North Korea to scale back . its belligerent rhetoric and, eventually, return to nuclear talks.

Travelling . to Beijing for the first time as secretary of state, Mr Kerry made no . secret of his desire to see China take a more activist stance towards . North Korea, which in recent weeks has threatened nuclear war against . the United States and South Korea. As . the North's main trading partner, financial backer and the closest . thing it has to a diplomatic ally, China has a unique ability to use its . leverage against the impoverished, isolated state, Mr Kerry said in the . South Korean capital, Seoul, yesterday before leaving for Beijing. 'Mr. President, this is obviously a critical time with some very challenging . issues - issues on the Korean peninsula, the challenge of Iran and . nuclear weapons, Syria and the Middle East, and economies around the . world that are in need of a boost,' Mr Kerry told Chinese President Xi .

Crisis talks: Mr Kerry with China's Premier Li Keqiang at a meeting at Beijing's Zhongnanhai compound today . 'Disturbances and provocation on the peninsula and regionally will harm the interests of all sides, which is like lifting a rock only to drop it on one's feet.' China had a testy relationship with Mr Kerry's predecessor, Hillary Clinton, believing her to be too abrasive in their disagreements over everything from human rights to territorial disputes like the South China Sea. Threats: The U.S. Secretary of State arrived in China today to seek the country's help in reigning in a belligerent North Korea . 'Clinton added fuel to the mistrust during her four-year term. We hope Kerry can pull it in the other direction,' China's widely read and influential Global Times tabloid said in an editorial. Mr Kerry's visit to Asia, which will include a stop in Tokyo tomorrow, takes place after weeks of shrill North Korean threats of war since the imposition of new UN sanctions in response to its third nuclear test in February. North Korea has repeatedly said it will not abandon nuclear weapons which it said on Friday were its 'treasured' guarantor of security. North Korean television made no mention of the U.S. politician's visit today and devoted most of its reports to preparations for Monday's celebrations marking the birth date of state founder Kim Il-Sung. These included a numerous floral tributes and grandiose flower show, foreign visitors seeing the sights of the capital ahead of the festivities and the unveiling of a monument in a provincial town. But Rodong Sinmun, the ruling Workers' Party's newspaper, issued a fresh denunciation of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises, saying: 'The outbreak of nuclear war has now become a fait accompli, owing to the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces. 'If the enemies dare provoke (North Korea) while going reckless, it will immediately blow them up with an annihilating strike with the use of powerful nuclear means.' However, South Korea's Yonhap news agency, quoting a government source, said North Korea had not moved any of its mobile missile launchers for the past two days after media reports that as many as five missiles had been moved into place on the country's east coast. Yonhap said there had been no signs of any movement by the mobile launchers since Thursday 'or that missile launches are imminent'.

Patrol: A North Korean soldier is seen talking on her mobile phone close to the town of Sinuju . Beijing, which sided with North Korea in the 1950-53 civil war against the U.S.- backed South, has been reluctant to apply pressure on Pyongyang, fearing the instability that could result if the North were to implode and send floods of refugees into China. It has looked askance at U.S. military drills in South Korea. Xinhua said in a commentary that Washington had itself been 'fanning the flames' on the Korean peninsula with its shows of force. Brinksmanship: A North Korean soldier takes pictures at the border village of Panmunjom . High-stakes: North Korea has threatened thermonuclear war on South Korea and the United States . 'It keeps sending more fighters, bombers and missile-defence ships to the waters of East Asia and carrying out massive military drills with Asian allies in a dramatic display of preemptive power,' it said. However, U.S. officials believe China's rhetoric on North Korea has begun to shift, pointing to a recent speech by China's Xi in which - without referring explicitly to Pyongyang - he said no country 'should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gain'. Meetings: John Kerry has urged Pyongyang's ally China to help rein in the rogue state . Mr Kerry told reporters in Seoul that if North Korea's 30-year-old leader went ahead with the launch of a medium-range missile, he would be making 'a huge mistake'. At a news conference in Seoul on Friday and in a U.S.-South Korean joint statement issued on Saturday, Mr Kerry signalled the U.S. preference for diplomacy to end the tension, but stressed North Korea must take 'meaningful' steps on denuclearisation. The United States and its allies believe the North violated the a 2005 aid-for-denuclearisation deal by conducting a nuclear test in 2006 and pursuing a uranium enrichment programme that would give it a second path to a nuclear weapon in addition to its plutonium-based programme.

Owen Campbell-Moore, a computer science student at Oxford University, has created a browser extension that allows people to share secret messages on the social networking site. Secretbook allows anyone with access to Google Chrome to hide 140 character long messages in JPEG images uploaded to Facebook and these messages can only be unlocked using a personal password. Secretbook allows anyone with access to Google Chrome to hide 140 character long messages in JPEG images uploaded to Facebook . It works by hiding messages amongst the millions of images that are uploaded to Facebook. It does this by changing a pixel to a different colour and then replicating it in many different pictures to spell out a message. This message is then only revealed to someone who knows the password and knows which pixel to look for. According to Wired.com, Mr Campbell-Moore spent two months designing the programme as part of a university project. It is the first time that anyone has managed to work out how to hide messages in computer files and it is very difficult for Facebook to detect as it operates through a Google Chrome web extension platform. Secretbook works by hiding steganographic messages where no one would think to look – in this case, among the millions of images that are uploaded to Facebook. Mr Campbell-Moore told Wired.com: ‘Many tools for steganography in JPEGs have existed in the past although they have always required that the images are transmitted exactly as they are.’ For example, this could be one pixel which has been changed to a different colour and then replicated in many pictures to spell out a message – to see this message you have to know the password and which pixel to look for. However, when a picture is uploaded to Facebook the image is automatically formatted which would render any message incomprehensible. It is the first time that anyone has managed to work out how to hide messages in computer files and it is very difficult for Facebook to detect as it operates through a Google Chrome web extension platform . As a result, Mr Campbell-Moore had to copy the sites recompression algorithm so that the encoded message is automatically compressed meaning that it does not change when recompressed by Facebook. Mr Campbell-Moore accepts that the technology could be used by terrorists but he believes that they would not use his method of steganography as it is not entirely secure. When Wired.com approached Facebook a spokesperson declined to comment on Secretbook.","Owen Campbell-Moore's plugin allows encoding of pictures with messages .

Drug addicts will be able to inject themselves with crack and heroin in 'safe rooms' as part of a scheme being considered by Britain's drugs death capital. Brighton is set to become the first city in the UK to provide official 'drug consumption rooms' where addicts can use heroin, crack and cocaine under supervision without fear of prosecution. Public health leaders in the city will meet this summer to give serious consideration to the plan which they say will 'save lives.' 'Safe room': Brighton health officials hope that supervision will reduce the risk of overdoses and public drugtaking . Last year Brighton and Hove was once again named and shamed as the drug death capital of the UK. Figures ranked the city worst in the country for drug-related fatalities per head of population with 104 fatalities between 2009 and 2011. Of the 35 deaths in 2010, 13 were the result of heroin overdoses and in 2009 promising medical student Hester Stewart died after taking a legal high called GBL. It is estimated that around 2,000 people in the city have a serious substance abuse issues. Rob Jarrett, chairman of Brighton's health and wellbeing board-the local authority agency given responsibility for public health under recent NHS reforms- said previous strategies had failed to tackle the problem. He told a Sunday newspaper that recent drug tackling policies in the city were tantamount to 'emotional knee-jerk reactions' that had not stopped users killing themselves. Keen supporter: Local MP Caroline Lucas of the Green Party believes the rooms would be an important innovation . He said: 'I think from our perspective we see the health benefits of accepting drug use is going to happen and it might as well be happening in a place that can be monitored. 'Our primary concern is the health of the people to make sure they don't kill themselves.' Mr Jarrett added: 'I believe in Switzerland, where it has been tried, it has worked. 'Up until now we have had policies that have been based on emotional knee-jerk reactions that haven't solved the problem at all.' The proposals were put forward by a drugs commission headed by crime author Peter James and Mike Trace, a former UK deputy drugs tsar. A report published by the independent body this week is expected to say that the drug consumption rooms would 'significantly reduce overdose death rates' and would not encourage further use. The commission was established following the prompting of local Green MP, Caroline Lucas. Mrs Lucas said that while the facilities would push at the fringes of the law, it could be an important innovation. 'Prohibition isn't working,' she said. 'This is a government that often says it wants to be guided by evidence and yet drugs policy is more or less an evidence-free zone.' More than 90 drug consumption rooms have been set up worldwide, including in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain. Mr Trace, vice chairman of the commission, said eradication of illegal drug use was not now a realistic aim and management should now be the priority. He said: 'A lot of drug partnerships around the country are doing good things but none of them have been able to get the drugs market under control. Similar set-up: The Insite supervised injection center in Vancouver, Canada where addicts can inject in safe surroundings . 'So we need to look for realistic objectives: ways of managing the market rather than eradicating the market. 'It is difficult for political leaders and executives within the police but you have to be honest about the situation. 'We are not going to do anything to make illegal drug use go away but there are things we can do to resolve health and crime problems.' Previously Andy Winter, chief executive of the Brighton Housing Trust, which runs the city's largest drug and alcohol treatment service blamed the drug problem on 'anything goes night time culture.' He said: 'We have to ask ourselves as a city whether we want to continue with this awful tag. Drug deaths: Brighton and Hove has been named the drug death capital of Britain for the second year in a row . 'Although people are enjoying the night time economy, there are victims too and that needs to change. 'However, we are seeing a better integration of services in Brighton and Hove then we have ever seen before and the drop in deaths reflects that. But even one death is one too many.' Charlie Lloyd, from York's mental health and addiction research group, said a study in Vancouver showed that public injections were reduced by 50% near the city's drug consumption room. He claimed there had never been an overdose in such a facility anywhere in the world. Martin Barnes, CEO of the UK drugs charity DrugScope said: 'There is significant evidence internationally that drug consumption rooms can help address the health and social harms associated with problem drug use - including reducing the risk of overdose, improving health and lessening costs to society. 'We support the piloting and evaluation of drug consumption rooms as a contribution to improving public health and reducing drug-related harms.' The proposals are due to be considered in June.","Brighton and Hove is the drug death capital of Britain .

An 'incredibly unusual' fossil fish with fins behind its anus could have implications for human evolution, researchers say. Dr Robert Sansom at The University of Manchester identified the paired fins of Euphanerops, a fossil jawless fish that swam in the seas around 370 million years ago. They say the unusual positioning of the fins show an important evolutionary shift. Euphanerops with the anal fins visible near the tail. Researchers say the dual fin development is unique, and could give clues to how legs and arms developed in humans . Euphanerops, a fossil jawless fish that swam in the seas around 370 million years ago. The Euphanerops fish were 3.9 inches (10 centimeters) long and looked somewhat like modern-day eels. The specimens in the latest study were unearthed in a fossil bed in Miguasha, Quebec, decades ago, and were stored in collections in the Natural History Museum in London and the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Miguasha, in Quebec. 'Euphanerops is unique because its anal fin is paired meaning there is one fin on each side of the fish,' said Dr Sansom. 'Up until now anal fins have only been seen on jawed fish where they are unpaired and this is true of both extinct and modern fish. 'The age of Euphanerops is important as it dates from the time of a deep evolutionary split between jawed and jawless fish, the two main divisions of vertebrates alive today. ' As such, it represents an important stage in the evolution of paired appendages.' Dr Sansom came across the paired fins as part of a study of Euphanerops fossils in Quebec, Canada. 3D surface scans of fossils and . comparison of specimens preserved in different conditions revealed that . there were two fan-shaped fins, a left and a right. 'It’s not clear why the fins are positioned so far back on the fish, or what advantage they might have provided. 'However, they do show that our early vertebrate ancestors tried out lots of different body plans before settling on two arms and two legs. Euphanerops, a fossil jawless fish that swam in the seas around 370 million years ago, is related to the eel . 'If they hadn’t then our bodies would have looked very different!' Dr Sansom’s research on the paired fins followed on from a 2009 study of early vertebrate evolution and fossil preservation with colleagues from The University of Leicester. Their findings have been published in the Royal Society’s journal Biology Letters. Dr Sansom says it was an exciting find: 'The unusual paired anal fin of Euphanerops lends support to the idea that there was some degree of developmental and evolutionary experimentation in some fish. 'After the Devonian period and the extinction of a lot of species, the jawed vertebrate body exhibits fewer deviations from the formula of paired pectoral, paired pelvic, unpaired dorsal and unpaired anal appendages. 'The discovery of new anatomical conditions will hopefully shed more light on the timing and sequence of the events underlying the origin and diversification of vertebrate appendages.'","Fins found on Euphanerops, a fossil jawless fish that swam in the seas around 370 million years ago .

Gone are the days of judging of a man’s character by the depth of his forehead or the position of his eyes. However, new research suggests that the shape of a man’s face can indicate whether he is likely to be a good sportsman. The study, carried out at Goldsmiths, University of London, found that Japanese baseball players with short, broad faces are more likely to display acumen on the sports field. Japanese baseball players with short, broad faces, like Ichiro Suzuki, are more likely to display acumen on the sports field, according to new research . Testosterone is a hormone which is primarily secreted in the testicles of men and the ovaries of women. It is the principal male sex hormone and plays a key role in the development of male reproductive organs. It is also responsible for promoting increases in muscle, bone mass and growth of body hair. On average, adult men have seven to eight times more testosterone in their blood than women do. It also showed that sportsmen with long faces are less likely to be successful baseball players. It is believed the explanation could be that having a wider jaw is an indication of having high levels of the hormone testosterone and that this plays a part in determining physical strength and aggression. The researchers, psychologists Hikaru Tsujimura and Michael Banissy, measured the facial width-to-height ratio of 104 baseball players in Japan’s professional league. They then followed the players for the 2011 and 2012 seasons and discovered that the players who scored the highest number of home runs also had the highest facial width-to-height ratio. In a paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, the researchers explained that this new data suggests that the findings may apply to people of all nationalities. The researchers believe that the findings also apply to people of other nationalities so it could apply to sports stars such as Wayne Rooney (left) and Sir Chris Hoy (right) They wrote that previous research has . uncovered a link between the facial width-to-height ratio and the . financial success of business leaders – this research suggested that . CEOs with broader faces are more likely to run successful firms. This work looked at Caucasian CEOs so the Japanese research implies that testosterone has the same effect on both face shape and success regardless of your nationality.

Price: £39.99 / $63.00 (RRP) 'A complete sniper experience,' boasts a quote from another website on its box. And indeed, if running around linear levels blasting hordes of samey-looking enemies is representative of real life then they have a point. Sadly, the only thing realistic about City Interactive's Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is its commendable ballistics. But even these can't hide its over-simplistic gameplay. Looks can be deceiving: Environments in Ghost Warrior are there primarily to show off the CryEngine 3 but there's no hiding the mundane gameplay . The almost non-existent plot follows the exploits of Private Security Consultant Captain Cole Anderson who travels around the world sniping bad guys. More often than not, gameplay requires you to remain hidden for as long as possible. You'll either be working with a spotter or sneak around by yourself. The latter is slightly more enjoyable given the horrendous macho 'banter' that plagues proceedings when with your ally. You're encouraged to scan areas before taking targets down, factoring in wind speed, direction and distance and it is satisfying scoring a direct, well-thought-out hit. There's even a slow-motion bullet cam that shows off particularly good kills. Sadly, it feels all too much like an extended and overly boring version of the Modern Warfare sniper sections. Even signature parts where you provide cover from elevated positions feel nothing more than glorified shooting galleries. Stealth sections, too, are just more of the same - albeit with a pistol and are ruined by inconsistencies in AI and cover. Whereas hiding in a bush works in one part, enemies may see you through the foliage in another. The game also punishes you for straying away from its defined boundaries. Wander off the beaten track or fire when not prompted and you'll be killed in an instant. Call of Duty games boast similar rigidity in level design but hide it behind smoke and mirrors - a trick Ghost Warrior 2 hasn't learned. Trial and error: There are some sections where you have to use night vision, but it doesn't stop the game feeling like a shooting gallery . It's not all negative, though. Compared to its muddy, drab predecessor, Ghost Warrior 2 is a good looking game. It's lost that 'budget' look thanks to the CryEngine 3 - especially on PC. The testing unit's Nvidia 680GTX graphics card allowed the game to run at the maximal 'very high' settings, resulting in some of the larger expanses looking fantastic. Closer inspection, though, reveals muddy, bland textures and character models look flat and uninspired. Equally uninspired is the multiplayer, offering two maps and a single Deathmatch mode. Still, there's a lot for 'campers' to enjoy here. But enjoyment is something of a rarity in Ghost Warrior 2 - a game that tried so hard but still missed the target.

No escape: Rapist Ian Phipps was tracked down after the DNA of his arrested son matched samples taken from his 1986 and 1991 victims . A double rapist who went undetected for nearly 30 years was finally caught by chance after police took a DNA sample from his son. Former Territorial Army soldier Ian Phipps, 50, thought he had escaped punishment for raping a girl of 14 and a 23-year-old woman in separate attacks in 1986 and 1991. He was tracked down after police entered the DNA of his son David Phipps, 25, into the national database when he was arrested and given a caution last September. His DNA matched those of the historic rape attacks, the first of which happened before he was born the second of which which took place when he was just two years old. Suspicion fell on his father, despite the elder Phipps having no criminal record, since the probability of the DNA profile coming from someone unrelated to the attacker was one in a billion. When police began to investigate Phipps they found that he had links to the area and matched the description given by both women. Both said their attacker as wearing Army trousers and heavy boots, and Phipps was serving in the TA at the time. He had originally denied the attacks when police interviewed him and was convinced that his DNA would not match that found on the victims. When a match was made Phipps initially claimed it must have been a 'dreadful mistake', but he later pleaded guilty to the historic crimes at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent. Sentencing Phipps to 15 years in jail and placing him on the sex-offenders' register indefinitely, Judge Charles Macdonald claimed 'extraordinary damage' had been done to both the victims. 'Is there any real remorse here?' he asked the convicted man. 'There were no guilty pleas until he saw evidence that the conviction was inevitable. I see no real remorse. 'You subjected these complainants to horrific ordeals which plainly changed their lives. These are wicked crimes.' 'Wicked crimes': Judge Charles Macdonald sitting at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) said 'extraordinary damage' had been done to both of Phipps' victims as he sentenced him to 15 years jail . In the first attack Phipps targeted a . girl of only 14 as she took a shortcut across some cement works on her . way home from school on January 8, 1986.

The woman tried to escape but after a struggle he raped her. Both victims gave matching descriptions of their attacker but Phipps was never caught. Michael Haynes, defending, told the court that since the rapes Phipps had undergone a kidney transplant, developed diabetes and suffered a stroke. 'He feels he won't come out of the other end,' Mr Haynes said. Detective Superintendant Rob Vinson, of Kent Police's Cold Case Investigation Team, reassured women that such cases are rare. 'Stranger rapes are extremely rare which is why it was important to get a result in the case of Ian Phipps,' he said.","Ian Phipps snared after his son's DNA matched samples from the attacks which took place in 1986 and 1991 .
