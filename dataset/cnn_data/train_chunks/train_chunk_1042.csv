"A boy could be left scarred for life after a temporary tattoo blistered his skin and sent him into toxic shock. Alfie Abbott had the Henna tattoo bought for him as a birthday present while on an all-inclusive holiday with his family in Turkey last month. But once home in Nottingham, the 11-year-old started complaining that the design was really itchy and a painful rash broke out all over his body. Reaction: Alfie Abbott, 11, suffered an extreme allergic reaction to the temporary ink, which left him with painful blisters on his upper arm (left). He has been left with visible scarring (right) which could be permanent . His concerned mother took him to the burns unit at the city's Queen’s Medical Centre hospital, where doctors said the schoolboy had gone into toxic shock. The £40 tribal design, which was applied at the five-star hotel's tattoo parlour, has left Alfie with visible scarring on his upper-right arm that could be permanent. Painful: The 11-year-old had the tribal tattoo bought for him as a birthday present while on an all-inclusive holiday with his family in Turkey. Shortly after returning home, he started saying the design was sore and itchy . The schoolboy has been in and out of hospital since getting the tattoo on 12 September to receive treatment for the scar, which his mother said 'won't stop weeping'. His mother Louise today criticised the Eftalia Splash Resort in Konakli, where she was staying with Alfie and daughters Kacey and Elle, saying 'He has been in agony'. She told the Sun: 'Doctors said he went into toxic shock and his arm won't stop weeping and the burns have left the tattoo blistered into his arm. Scarred: The schoolboy has been in and out of hospital since getting the tattoo on 12 September receiving treatment for the scar, which his mother said 'won't stop weeping'. Pictured: The scar slowly healing . Slammed: His mother Louise today criticised the resort in Konakli,  saying 'He has been in agony' 'It’s disgusting, you’d think they would do checks on what goes on in hotels they are sending people to. She added: 'He now faces years of trips to hospital to try to do something about the scarring that covers his arm.' Earlier this year, two schoolboy brothers were left scarred for life after dodgy Henna left permanent scars on their backs. Liam, 16, and Owen Groves, 14, pestered their mother to allow them to have henna body art while on an all-inclusive holiday in Egypt. But instead of natural henna the tattoo artist, who worked in the resort where they were staying, used super-strength black henna. The brothers now can't take their tops off in the sun as doctors warned to avoid direct sunlight on the area. Thomas Cook admit they do not recommend their customers have henna tattoos at their hotels. A spokesman said: 'We know how important a holiday is to our customers, and are most concerned to learn of the negative reaction to a henna tattoo sustained by Master Abbot after his holiday in Turkey earlier this month. 'We wish Master Abbot a full recovery following his experience, and invite his parents to contact us in haste so that we can address their complaint directly and personally.'","Alfie Abbott had the £40 tribal design inked at five-star resort in Konakli .

"Young people who get drunk several times a week are at risk of suffering a mental illness, doctors have warned. While it's no secret that binge drinking can cause major health problems,  too much alcohol can have a dangerous effect on mood disorders and slow brain development. Sydney experts found young people who already suffer mental health problems, can worsen their symptoms. Scroll down for video . Too much alcohol can have a dangerous effect on mood disorders and slow brain development, doctors warn . Drinking alcohol on a weekly basis could affect the structural and neurochemical changes to the parts of the brain responsible for long-term memory and decision making, according to ABC. Dr Daniel Hermens from the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Research Institute (BMRI) told ABC that between the ages of 16 and 25 brains are undergoing a lot of change and alcohol can impair that growth. 'If you're a young person with depression, a history of depression, or even a family history of depression, then you may be at an even greater risk of brain changes, changes in your concentration and your memory if you misuse alcohol,' Dr Hermens said. Drinking alcohol on a weekly basis could affect the structural and neurochemical changes to parts of brain . But good news is that the young brain is 'best equipped to recover', according to Dr Daniel Hermens . ABC reports the Brain and Mind Research Institute wants to develop a cognitive screening test for hospitals and GPs to detect the subtle neurological impacts of alcohol misuse in young people's brains. 'The really good news about all this though is that the young brain is best equipped to recover,' Dr Hermens said. Psychiatrist Dr Elizabeth Scott from Headspace told ABC that without early intervention, young people are in danger of developing more persistent and chronic problems that have a major impact on their adult life. 'Young people with mental health problems are two to three times more likely to use drugs and alcohol compared to their peers of the same age in the general community,' she said. 'The mix of mental health problems and drugs and alcohol problems can lead to vicious cycles of illness and disability.'","Too much alcohol can have a dangerous effect on mood disorders and slow brain development, doctors warn .

"Leonardo Da Vinci changed his mind twice while painting one of his best-known works, scientists claim - after he left out the animal which has made it famous. The Italian master's 1490 work The Lady with an Ermine features Milanese mistress Cecilia Gallerani cradling a stoat in its white winter coat, a powerful symbol of purity. But a three-year study has shown the artist initially painted the woman without an animal at all, then added only a spindly grey creature, before settling on the final version. Scroll down for video . Changing his mind: A study has shown Leonardo Da Vinci painted now-obscured versions of his masterpiece The Lady with an Ermine - first leaving out the animal (left) before including only a thin grey creature (right) Finished work: The final painting, pictured, includes the white ermine as a powerful symbol of the lady's purity . The discovery was made by French optical engineer Pascal Cotte, who has previously analysed the original colours of the now-faded Mona Lisa, Da Vinci's best-known portrait. He invented a technology called the Layer Amplification Method (LAM) to analyse each addition to the oil painting, from the wood on which the canvas was mounted to the visible pigments on top. He and his team projected intense lights onto the painting, which normally hangs in Krakow, Poland, and analysed the way in which they were reflected. By taking these microscopic measurements they were able to decode how the painting had been built up over time. Mr Cotte told the BBC: 'The LAM technique gives us the capability to peel the painting like an onion, removing the surface to see what's happening inside and behind the different layers of paint. 'We've discovered that Leonardo is always changing his mind. This is someone who hesitates - he erases things, he adds things, he changes his mind again and again.' Painstakng: French optical engineer Pascal Cotte, who has also studied the Mona Lisa (left), said Da Vinci (right) was 'always changing his mind. This is someone who hesitates - he erases things, he adds things' His findings have now been published in a 300-page book about the painting and how its secrets were uncovered. The Lady with an Ermine was one of only four paintings of women by Da Vinci, but historians had found it odd that a 1493 poem about it did not mention the animal for which it is famous. Mr Cotte believes the work began as a far more conventional portrait of Miss Gallerani, who was a mistress of his patron, the Duke of Milan. He said his findings suggest the Duke - who was nicknamed the 'white ermine' - may have suggested the animal's inclusion in order to reference himself in the painting. Or his mistress, who was thought to be just 16 when Da Vinci painted her, could have requested the animal in order to make her relationship with the Duke public. The ermine, which is another name for a stoat in its brilliant winter coat, was also a long-standing symbol of purity. Admired: The work was the star turn in a major Leonardo exhibition at London's National Gallery in 2011 . Da Vinci wrote a catalogue of animals in which he said: 'The ermine out of moderation never eats but once a day. 'It would rather let itself be captured by hunters than take refuge in a dirty lair, in order not to stain its purity.' Its soft, unblemished coat was also prized for use in ceremonial robes, making the animal a sought-after statement of luxury and courtly wealth. The painting was the star turn in a Leonardo exhibition at the National Gallery in London in 2011 which attracted hundreds of thousands of art lovers. It was one of the first to use oil paint, a technique which had been introduced to Italy just a few years earlier. Mr Cotte co-founded the Multispectral Institute (LTMI), an expert body on scientifically analysing paintings, and has used his technology to digitise The Lady with an Ermine and the Mona Lisa. He has already digitised more than 2,000 masterpieces, allowing them to be studied in great depth without being removed from gallery walls.","Italian Renaissance master painted The Lady with an Ermine in 1490 .

"A mother-of-four credits her amazing 12st weight loss to a bet she made with her late grandmother. Karen Sharpe, 38, was 24st 10lb and was about to join the waiting list for a NHS gastric band procedure when her 82-year-old grandmother Betty urged her to forget surgery and lose weight through tried-and-tested dieting. Mrs Sharpe, of Leicester, was challenged to lose five stone with the promise that if she achieved the milestone, her grandmother would pay her £1,000. Scroll down for video . Also larger, Karen saw her weight spin further out of control following the birth of her first child Natasha . Karen has dropped from 24st 10lb (left) and size 32 to 12st 10lb and size 12 (right) through diet and exercise . Four years down the line, Mrs Sharpe now weighs 12st 10lb, having slimmed down an impressive ten dress sizes. She said: 'I owe my grandmother so much. I'm so relieved that I chose to get it done the hard way rather than take the tempting surgery option. 'Friends I know who have had surgery have had a difficult time adjusting to life after the operation. But I'm stronger, fitter and more like myself than ever before. 'If it wasn't for nan, I don't know what sort of shape I'd be in today.' Mrs Sharpe, who now works as a Weight Watchers group assistant, ballooned to a dress size 32 after falling into a cycle of comfort eating at a young age. She said: 'I was teased for being overweight at school, and that made me want to eat more. I was drawn to processed savoury foods like Pot Noodles.' Mrs Sharpe, who is married to floor layer David Sharpe, 35, and who has four children, Natasha, eight, Emily, 11, Nathan, 13, and Megan 14, saw her weight spin further out of control following the birth of her first child. Karen, here with son Nathan at a size 32, used to gorge on large portions of high fat food for comfort . She said: 'My weight went up and up after each one. I concentrated on being a mum, so didn't pay too much attention to what I was eating myself. Although I wasn't diagnosed, I believe I suffered with a touch of post-natal depression, which pushed me back towards comfort eating.' In the spring of 2010, facing troubling backache and chronic fatigue, Mrs Sharpe turned to her GP for help. She said: 'I was approved to join the NHS waiting list for a gastric band. I was happy, because I'd tried dieting and nothing had worked. I knew that if I didn't make a big change, then I was well on my way to being housebound. 'When I told my nan the good news, she said quite matter-of-factly that I shouldn't have the surgery. Karen's grandmother Betty, here with her husband Jack,  died at the age of 83, never having seen the full extent of Karen's success that she inspired . 'She had worked as a nurse and knew that invasive surgery was nothing to be trifled with. She knew how long it took to recover from major procedures. 'She told me I could lose weight through hard work if I really wanted to. She said she believed in me, and promised to pay me £1,000 if I managed to lose five stone in weight. 'It really set me thinking. While my NHS nutritionist was telling me to enjoy myself and eat whatever food I liked because I was due to get a gastric band, my nan was advising me to be sensible and become healthier. I turned away from the surgery route and opened myself up to encouragement from nan instead.' Mrs Sharpe joined her local weight watchers group and began regular exercise, and was amazed to see her weight drop away. Mrs Sharpe joined her local weight watchers group and began regular exercise, and was amazed to see her weight drop away . But in February 2011, as her weight loss tally reached 4st 4lb, her grandmother passed away suddenly from a chest infection at the age of 83. She said: 'Nan and I were very close. I spent loads of time with her when I was a child. After she died I was very upset, and went off the rails a bit with my dieting. 'But after a few weeks I realised that nan was such a formidable, determined woman that if she saw me lose my way, she would come back and haunt me. I didn't want to let her down, so I redoubled my efforts..' In February 2010, when she weight 24st 10lb and wore size 32 clothes, Mrs Sharpe typically ate bacon and egg sandwiches with toast and butter for breakfast, followed by chicken nuggets with chips for lunch, and takeaway mushroom curry with egg fried rice for her evening meal. She would snack on salt and vinegar crisps throughout the day. Today, weighing 12st 10lb and wearing size 12 clothing, she has a smoothie with almond milk and peanut butter powder for breakfast, grilled chicken breast with roasted vegetable cous cous for lunch, and cottage pie with fresh vegetables for her evening meal. When she snacks, she eats lower-fat crisps or apples. She said: 'I'm proud of how far I've come. I think of nan frequently and she's still encouraging me, even though she's passed away. I want to lose another stone or so, and with her help I know I can do it. 'My weight loss has affected my life in so many positive ways. I can be an active, healthy mum, and David has even joined a gym because of my example. 'I know that if I'd taken the easy way out and gone for the surgery, I would be nowhere near as healthy as I am today. 'I have nan to thank for everything.'","Obese at nearly 25st, Karen was considering weight-loss surgery .

"This is the moment a Premier League star was arrested for drunkenly assaulting a police officer hours after playing Manchester United. West Ham defender, James Tomkins, 25, pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly outside the Sugar Hut nightclub in Brentwood, Essex. He also admitted assaulting and obstructing a police constable during the incident on December 21 and was fined £3,500 when he appeared at Southend Magistrates’ Court today. Scroll down for video . James Tomkins, West Ham defender, is arrested by police for being drunk and disorderly in Brentwood, Essex . Officers escort him to the police car, where he  injured an officer. He was fined £3,500 for the assault . The footballer had been partying at the hotspot made famous by the ITV2 series The Only Way Is Essex hours after his club’s 3 – 1 defeat at Old Trafford. The court heard that Tomkins had been pushed hard by a member of staff but he admitted ‘over-reacting’. Martin Everett, chair of the bench at Southend Magistrates’ Court, told him that in the police car he dealt with the situation ‘inappropriately causing an injury to the police officer’. He added that ‘this is a blot on your character’ and he had ‘no doubt that West Ham will take their own action’ to punish him. The footballer pleaded guilty to all three charges when he appeared at Southend Magistrates' Court today . Mr Everett told him: ‘It is a late guilty plea but it has saved the court a trial and witnesses’. James Tomkins was spotted playing for his local Sunday League side at the age of seven and was signed to West Ham United’s youth academy. He started out his football career as a striker before switching to his current position in central defence. He has represented England internationally at U15, U16, U17, U19 and U21 levels and played every match of the 2008 UEFA U19 Championships. Tomkins made his Premier League debut on March 22, 2008 in a 1-1 draw away to Everton. In November 2008 he was signed to Derby County on a five week loan before he was recalled to West Ham on December 31. He played for Great Britain twice in the 2012 Olympics – in matches against Brazil and UAE. Rupert Bowers, defending, told the court that as a footballer he gets ‘a lot of attention - much of it unwanted’. He said: ‘They receive training and receive guidance from the Football Association. Mr Tomkins accepts that on this occasion he let himself down. ‘He has been extremely stressed about these proceedings, about his reputation and the coverage it has had.’ He also described Tomkins, who stood quietly in the dock during sentencing, as a ‘young man of previous good character [who is] usually looked up to.’ Tomkins, who was a former England Under-21 international and appeared for Team GB at the 2012 Olympics, was ordered to pay £3,785 court costs, £200 compensation to the police officer and a £120 victim surcharge. He was told he would face no further charges and left the court and into a waiting car without comment. MailOnline made contact with West Ham United which has refused to comment on the matter.

"Contrary to popular belief, high-fliers are having more babies than ever, reveals new research. A study, which will be published in the Economic Journal, claims that despite the long-held view that career-minded women have fewer children, fertility rates among highly educated women are in fact on the rise. Economists Moshe Hazan and Hosny Zoabi have discovered that fertility rates among American women with advanced degrees have risen by over 50 per cent in the last 30 years, reports The Observer. Baby boom: A new study reveals that fertility rates among highly educated career women are on the rise . According to their research, American women with college degrees have a fertility rate of 1.88 children - a figure that rises to 1.96 for those with advanced degrees. This is a significant rise from 1980, when the fertility rate was 1.2 for women who had studied for 16 years or more. 'The relationship between fertility and women’s education in the US has recently become U-shaped,' say the researchers. Hazan believes the results are down to a rapidly rising inequality gap between women: those who work hard and can afford to pay for childcare and those who provide the services at an affordable price. Speaking about his results, Hazan told the paper: 'I looked around at friends in Israel and the US and I noticed those who juggle careers, work very hard and earn enough money seem to have more kids. Then you go through the data and you find it is true. Explanation: Researchers believe the results of the study are down to a rapidly rising inequality gap between women: those who work hard and can afford to pay for childcare and those who provide the services at an affordable price . 'You have a nanny, people to pick up your laundry and suits, buy you food from the local store for you to cook for dinner, and you can leave all the mess to the housekeeper in the morning.' The researchers, who say the income gap theory applies to about 30 per cent of findings, believe we will begin to see a similar trend in Europe. Google and Apple recently announced that they would be providing financial support for female employees who wanted to freeze their eggs, which can cost up to £12,600. Since turning 35 earlier this month, Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry has decided to freeze hers. The TV star, who shot to fame after winning Alan Sugar's approval on the BBC reality show, has made the decision after reaching her mid-thirties without finding The One. But the choice also centres around Michelle's successful career in business, which she believes would face a setback if she took time out right now to have children. Michelle told This Morning: 'We live in this society now where it used to be that women stayed at home, the chap was the breadwinner, but times have now changed because we have a choice. 'Lots of women want to stay at home, but I’m in a position now where I want to focus on my career. 'I believe that I can achieve anything that I want in the workplace and the one thing that is restricting me is my biological clock . 'It’s a mixture of three things, I have an awful lot that I want to achieve in my career, I haven’t met the right guy yet that I want to settle down with and also I feel like I’m just not ready.'

"There is a lot more money to be made from the captaincy of a club as huge as Manchester United if the armband goes to a shooting star rather than a natural-born leader with an unselfishly over-riding perspective of the game. Hence the agents of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have been doing everything in their power to press the claims of their respective clients. Louis van Gaal beware. Since the Dutch tyrant does not like being told what to do by anyone – least of all we media hacks - he would be wise consult the evidence before bringing the curse of the celebrity skipper down upon Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney favourite for captaincy . Leading question: Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie are both in the running to captain Manchester United . Decisions, decisions: Louis van Gaal will have to choose his captain before the start of the season . VIDEO Rooney favourite for captaincy . After all, he had a close-up view of the World Cup in Brazil. Just to remind United’s new manager - the final was won by Germany under the concentrated leadership of defender Philipp Lahm, not Argentina while Lionel Messi was obsessing over his vain attempt to rediscover the form which used to make him the world’s best footballer. Had Javier Mascherano been Argentina’s captain he would have had the authority to tell dear little Leo to pull his finger out. Just in case Van Gaal has forgotten, Van Persie was captain of his Dutch team which enjoyed a goal-spree in the group phase but then dried up as it stumbled into that dire semi-final against Argentina. By way of further study, let me refer him to World Cups past. Of the 19 winning skippers in the tournament’s history, only one can be categorised as a glamorous goalscorer. And that, my brother Englishmen, was an old friend of ours who just happens to be the greatest player ever to captain his country. Diego Maradona raised his Hand of God to victory in Mexico 86. But didn’t Pele captain the 1970 Brazilians who remain the best team of all time? Er, no, that would be Carlos Alberto. So what about Zinedine Zidane for the only French glory in Paris 98? No, that was Didier Deschamps. It was Dunga not Romaria and Cafu not Ronaldo for Brazil in 1994 and 2002….. Passarella not Kempes for Argentina 78…… Zoff not Rossi and Cannavaro not Del Piero or Totti for Italy in 1982 and 2006. Captaincy in football may not seem as obviously important as in cricket and rugby but it is a serious business. So serious that after Maradona probably the highest profile personalities to raise the World Cup aloft are the two greatest defenders of all time, men who were deeply perceptive readers of the game and who took leadership by example and inspiration very seriously indeed: Franz Beckenbauer and Bobby Moore. Victorious leader: Philipp Lahm (left) captained Germany to a World Cup final win over Lionel Messi's Argentina . The glitterati who have fallen short as captains at the very highest level is long and revealing. As well as Messi and Van Persie it includes Johan Cruyff, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Cristiano Ronaldo now, Romania’s Gheorghe Hagi twice and the man who has cashed in most spectacularly on the armband… England’s very own David Beckham. It is the mega-millions banked by Beckham which most excites the commercial representatives of Rooney and Van Persie. Bryan Robson, United’s Captain Marvel, has been England’s best skipper since Moore but like this country’s only World Cup winner he reigned before the sponsorship, endorsement and advertising markets exploded. Now there appears to be no limit to the fortunes achievable through the honour of captaining United. Whether that will extend to winning trophies for the club is less certain. Water carrier: The captain of France in 1998 wasn't the star Zinedine Zidane but Didier Deschamps (right) Van Persie is a wonderful striker but he does not carry the bearing of a leader, so immersed is he in his own game. For Van Gaal to appoint his fellow Dutchman would smack of favouritism. Rooney is United’s, as well as England’s, best player and a dynamic goalscorer in his own right. But while he does throw himself into the team effort he does so in a frenzied manner rather than with a deep understanding of the direction in which his endeavours might best be directed. And some at the club will never forget that he wanted to quit Old Trafford until United offered him even bigger bucks to stay. Frankly, unhappy though both of them may well be if passed over, they would better left to get on with the job they do best – that of winning rather than controlling matches. Strong captain: Nemanja Vidic was skipper at United until his departure for Inter Milan in the summer . The coming to such a conclusion is further complicated for Van Gaal by the current absence of a strong candidate for the captaincy. Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand have gone from Old Trafford and others are about to follow. If Thomas Vermaelen, recently club captain without team portfolio at Arsenal, is brought in he could be one answer. If Darren Fletcher is fully fit, he should be a strong contender. But how United must wish they, not their great Manchester rivals City, had bought Vincent Kompany – a captain by more than name if ever there was one. Anderson should just let his bowling do the talking . Times have changed since cricketers used to tell opposing batsmen they had just enjoyed group sex with their mothers and that their sisters were whores and it was all considered just part of the game. Changed not least because the f-word and the c-word are now audible and visible on television. Changed because cricketers are now higher-earning public figures than they used to be and with the money and fame comes responsibility. Let the ball do the work: James Anderson (right) snarls after dismissing his nemesis Ravindra Jadeja . Jumping for joy: Anderson leaps into the air as he enjoys taking the wicket of Virat Kohli . Changed because it is more important than ever to set an example to youngsters which rises above the gutter, not sinks into it. So no, whatever the good old boys in the commentary box chunter on about, it was not acceptable for Jimmy Anderson to behave like a Borstal school-yard bully, even though he got off that misconduct charge. Anderson has just proved to himself, by taking three wickets in the first innings demolition of his Indian protagonists, that he can be just as deadly with the ball without hurling foul-mouthed insults in its wake. Hopefully the change in his behaviour is permanent – and we can all settle down to enjoy watching England win Test matches like this one.","There's a lot of money to be made from being United captain .

"It had to be him. As the clock ticked towards its 92nd minute and with no discernible reason to suggest that Arsenal would come away with anything more than a point against a staunch Crystal Palace, up popped Aaron Ramsey. Right place, right time. Slammed past Julian Speroni and there would be no first day slip-ups that have become the norm for Arsene Wenger. Arsenal won on the opening day for the first time since 2009 and had their fulcrum to thank. There is an argument that the last-gasp winner could have fallen to anyone, but it was no mistake that Ramsey took up a clever station, alone at the back post, to plunder home. It’s the seventh game in under a year that goals from the Welshman have won the Gunners a game. From central midfield, that’s some record. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cazorla get his ears flicked by Wilshere, Ramsey and Flamini . At it again: Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey scored the winner in added time against Crystal Palace on Saturday . Right place, right time: The Welsh midfielder has made a habit of popping up when the Gunners need him most . Team player: Ramsey's team-mates pile on top of him after the 2-1 win in Arsenal's Premier League opener .

Make no mistake, this was not vintage Ramsey. He - much like the rest of Arsenal’s midfield - was guilty of giving the ball away needlessly against Palace and actually struggled to impose himself on the game, saying as much afterwards. But what sets him apart, even when he’s not at the races, is that prowess in front of goal. Sixteen last year - even after four months out injured - along with two already this. There is even a tinge of Frank Lampard about the way in which he comes alive on the edge coupled with that drive to go and join in with the lone front man. The common conception is that if Ramsey stays fit, Arsenal may just upset those at the Etihad and Stamford Bridge come May. And it’s difficult to argue. Here is a man who can drag this side through games, take control of the tightest of battles and is the club’s heartbeat. His stock continues to rise after each 90 minutes. In the current financial climate, the figures Arsenal could demand are astronomical. How much is he now worth? £40million, Alan Shearer mused on Saturday night? Potentially more. Trophy at last: Ramsey sealed Arsenal's FA Cup win against Hull City in a sparkling breakthrough season . No stopping him: He also popped up with the winner against Dortmund in the Champions League last year . Hunt for silverware: Ramsey lead the Gunners to the FA Cup, can he do the same with the Premier League . There is no chance he’ll be leaving the Emirates any time soon, though. This has been the first summer for a long time whereby Wenger hasn’t lost top players - the ailing Thomas Vermaelen and Bacary Sagna aren’t in the same league as others who previously departed - and there isn’t that pressure to cash in any longer. Ramsey has proven he is the player to build a new team around, and that’s what the manager has begun to do. Signing Mesut Ozil last year and Alexis Sanchez this shows the type of intent that has been severely lacking over the last decade. But what’s more, from Ramsey’s point of view at least, he now has colleagues of a similar classy ilk. While the Chilean was another to disappoint on home debut, it’s plain to see that his movement off the ball is something the chief playmaker will relish. And Arsenal will need Ramsey’s invention mixed with runners in between the lines if they are to win enough games to launch a title charge, Palace - actually buoyed by the bizarre circumstances to have engulfed the club’s Premier League preparations over the last few days - demonstrated that they are a tricky customer to break down; the hosts offered very little, but still found a way of picking up three points. Happy to have him: Arsene Wenger's side were in a spot of bother before Ramsey came to the party . Shut out: Alexis Sanchez struggled to make an impact for Arsenal on his Premier League debut . Star: Meanwhile, Ramsey is one of Europe's premier midfielders who can galvanise the Gunners . There had been hallmarks of the dithering performance against Aston Villa on this weekend last year, when they were beaten to a chorus of boos. Not this time. Ramsey and co found a way, just, and it’s something they will have to keep up. Last season’s draws against Swansea, West Brom and Everton must be converted, defeat at Stoke reversed. Wenger is close to assembling a squad ready to win this division again, and in Ramsey has one of Europe’s premier midfielders to galvanise a group in need of a leader.","Ramsey scored the winner for Arsenal in added time against Crystal Palace .

"Exposed: A devastating report today reveals how mishandling of foreign criminals costs £1bn a year . A devastating report today reveals the £1billion-a-year failure by successive governments to police Britain’s borders and deport even the most dangerous foreign criminals. According to Westminster’s spending watchdog, foreign offenders are able to walk into the country unchecked, commit new offences – then cheat removal on human rights grounds once their jail terms are complete. Incredibly, the Home Office has lost track of 760 of the 4,200 foreign criminals who had been freed back on to our streets by the end of March 2014 pending their removal. It includes 58 ‘high harm’ individuals, a category that includes rapists, killers and drug dealers. The ’appalling’ annual cost to the taxpayer of each foreign criminal is £70,000 – or a total of between £770million and £1.04billion a year. The National Audit Office (NAO) launched an investigation to find out if improvements had been made since the 2006 foreign prisoner scandal, when 1,000 were released without being considered for deportation. It found: . The 48-page report found failings at every stage of the system. In theory, a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to more than 12 months for a crime in their homeland can be turned away at the border. Yet the Home Office is relying on a Warning Index system that is more than a decade out of date, often fails to work properly and is based on ad hoc information sharing agreements with other countries. Attention: HMP Canterbury, which holds exclusively foreign nationals. The report found one in six overseas inmates freed from jail has absconded and 151 inmates were freed without being considered for removal . In 2006, the Labour government declined to join up to a Europe-wide information sharing regime, known as the Schengen Information System, that would have given access to alerts on known criminals. It leaves Britain as one of only four countries out of 32 in the European Economic Area that cannot access the data. Ministers are now planning to join later this year. NAO officials estimate as many as 1,400 of the 12,250 foreign offenders living in the UK at the end of March 2014 could have been turned away, had their offending histories been known. Police are also failing to take action when they stop a foreign national. There is a separate computer system, known as ECRIS, which the UK does have access to – but can only be used when a suspect is already inside the UK’s borders. In only three out of every ten cases are officers bothering to use it. This means that inmates who had a criminal record at home – who could have been detained and deported, based on their offending history – were allowed to remain in the UK, and potentially commit new crimes. The NAO estimates that simply carrying out proper checks could save the taxpayer £70million a year. Jail: Bullwood Hall in Essex, which holds only foreign inmates. Each one costs the taxpayer £70,000 . The shambles continues even after a foreign offender has been convicted and sent to prison. The NAO found a ‘lack of urgency’ in the system and poor information sharing. Staff referring cases to the Home Office to start the removals process have to ‘send paper forms that are faxed’ because the IT systems are incompatible. Similar bureaucracy is hindering the hunt for the 760 criminals who have absconded after being freed from jail, often pending an appeal against deportation on human rights grounds. Officials are only allowed to request 250 individual checks to HMRC for information on whether the criminals may have turned up elsewhere in the tax or benefits system. Margaret Hodge, chairman of Westminster’s public accounts committee, said: ‘I am astounded that the number of foreign nationals in prisons has increased to 10,649 since 2006 and that, of those released, 760 currently waiting to be deported have disappeared and around 150 are thought not to have been considered for deportation. ‘It’s appalling that only 30 per cent of potential foreign national offenders in custody were searched on immigration databases to see if they had committed crimes overseas. ‘It beggars belief that the Home Office and Ministry of Justice are managing the removal of foreign national offenders without knowing basic costs and how best to target their resources.’ Tory MP Philip Hollobone, a long-standing critic of the failure to deport foreign criminals, said the public would be ‘staggered’ by the revelations. He added: ‘My view is that if you are a foreign national who commits a crime in the UK, you should be caught, convicted and sentenced with your sentence served back in your own country at the expense of your fellow nationals. ‘If their countries won’t take them, then their embassies should be sent the bill. All such individuals should be banned from ever returning to our shores.’ Despite its own leading role in the debacle, Labour attacked the Government’s record. Margaret Hodge, chairman of Westminster’s public accounts committee, said the situation 'beggars belief' Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘David Cameron made a commitment to reduce the number of foreign prisoners and to deport more of them, but yet again he has failed to deliver.’ The number of foreign criminals kicked out last year was 5,097 – an improvement on 2006, but down from the high of 5,613 in 2008-09.Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘Foreign nationals who fundamentally abuse our hospitality by committing crime should be in no doubt of our resolute approach in seeking their removal. ‘The countless appeals and re-appeals lodged by criminals attempting to cheat the system cost us all money and are an affront to British justice. That is why we are putting a stop to that abuse through the Immigration Act. ‘New powers came into force this week to cut the number of grounds on which criminals can appeal their deportation and to end the appeals conveyor belt in the courts. They will build on the measures we introduced in the summer which are already speeding up the deportation process.’ ANALYSIS: Chaotic system that cost Alice her life . Today's revelations raise chilling new questions about cases such as that of murdered 15-year-old Alice Gross. Alice’s suspected killer Arnis Zalkalns – found hanged a week after the schoolgirl’s body was discovered in the River Brent last month – was able to waltz into the UK despite having a conviction in Latvia for murdering his wife. He then slipped through the net a second time when he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of indecently assaulting a teenage girl in West London in 2009. In total, he is believed to have walked in and out of the country more than 20 times without being stopped. Tragedy: Arnis Zalkans (left), the suspected killer of Alice Gross (right), had a previous murder conviction . When the scandal first broke, Whitehall officials pointed the finger of blame at poor information sharing by our EU neighbours. Yet, according to the National Audit Office, there is masses of information available on foreign criminals which Britain is simply not bothering to access. This includes the so-called Schengen Information System, which Labour opted not to join in 2006 – despite signing us up to a raft of other EU justice initiatives. Of the 32 members of the European Economic Area, we are one of only four countries not to take part in a regime which offers alerts on known foreign criminals. Which, in turn, raises the disturbing prospect that information was available that might have allowed Zalkalns to be turned away at the border – but nobody bothered to request it. Even accounting for EU edicts on free movement, there would have been a powerful case for refusing him entry and preventing the horrors which followed. Meanwhile, what of the Met’s failure to uncover Zalkalns’s past when he was arrested in 2009 – which would again have been sufficient grounds to boot him out. Was Zalkalns among the 70 per cent of cases where police do not even bother to do a search, when they apprehend a foreign national? What is certain is that, eight years on from the 2006 foreign prisoner scandal, this country remains one of the most hospitable in Europe for the continent’s worst criminals.","Findings revealed today in report by Westminster's National Audit Office .

"Georgios Samaras is expected to arrive at West Bromwich Albion on Thursday as talks about signing for the club on a free transfer edge closer to completion. The Greece international striker has been identified as a player who could operate as a centre forward or in wide areas. His two-footed ability is also seen as a plus. Samaras, 29, is without a club after Celtic failed to offer him new terms at the end of his Parkhead contract. He has attracted interest from Sampdoria, Sevilla and Hamburg and recently had discussions with Malaga.

But it is believed West Brom appeals to the former Manchester City striker as he only needs to move his family south of the border.

"Fears that Australia is in a property bubble are set to fade as worries turn to unemployment and inflation, a leading economist says. Tim Toohey, head of economics at Goldman Sachs, predicts the Australian economy will struggle in 2015 and will go into 'income shock' as mining investment drops off. But he said the Reserve Bank of Australia is unable to adopt an 'easing bias' - meaning it would favour cutting interest rates over raising them - because of Australia's booming property market, Fairfax reported. The Reserve Bank of Australia is unable to cut interest rates or go further and change to an 'easing bias' because of Australia's booming property market, says Goldman Sachs head of economics Tim Toohey . Houses stand along the waterfront in Sydney's Point Piper, one of Australia's most expensive suburbs . 'There's really only one hurdle standing in front of the RBA in terms of adopting back an easing bias and it is pure and simply house prices,' Mr Toohey told Bloomberg. Mr Toohey said concerns would shift away from property and any change to the official cash rate in the next year would be based upon the unemployment rate and inflation, rather than house prices. Mr Toohey added that Goldman Sachs reluctantly withdrew its call for the RBA to drop the official cash rate from 2.5 percent to 2.25 percent in August, but said the 'balance of risks still skew in that direction'. AMP chief economist Shane Oliver agreed that worries about a property bubble will fade over time. 'As affordability has deteriorated and as the Reserve Bank continues with its warnings to investors and the possibility of greater constraints on bank lending the pace of gains in property prices will slow down,' Mr Oliver said. 'It's certainly true that the property bubble has constrained them a bit - they might have preferred to cut rates sooner if it wasn't for concerns of a property bubble.' A job seeker takes notes as he browses job notices at a jobs and skills expo in Melbourne. Fears that Australia is in a property bubble are set to fade as worries turn to unemployment and rising inflation . Mr Toohey said the impact of the end of the mining boom will be worse than experts are currently predicting, and the economy will suffer 'income shock' in the next year due to a drop in the price of coal and iron ore experts. He told Bloomberg the Australian dollar needed to fall, but he clarified that it needed to drop 'lower relative to where commodity prices actually are going'. Mr Toohey said Goldman Sachs predicts that the inflation rate will finish the year below 2 percent. The annual inflation rate eased to 2.3 per cent in the September quarter, and the RBA aims to keep it between 2 and 3 percent. But Mr Oliver said he did not predict a dramatic rise in unemployment in the near future, nor did he think that inflation would fall below 2 percent because the Aussie dollar was trending downwards. Mr Toohey said the Australia dollar needed to fall  'lower relative to where commodity prices actually are going' The dollar spent the period between April and early September hovering around 93 and 94 US cents, but since then had dropped off and even hit a low of 86.43 US cents in early October. On Tuesday morning the Australian dollar was trading at 88.04 US cents. 'I don't see inflation as a problem,' Mr Oliver said. 'My feeling is inflation could go a little bit lower, towards 2 percent, but I don't see it falling below 2 percent.' Mr Oliver said inflation would be kept in check so long as the Aussie dollar continued to fall. 'With falling commodity prices the Aussie dollar needs to fall back again,' he said. 'If we're going to see a re-balancing of the economy we need to breathe life into tourism and manufacturing sector. 'And if we want to see them going again we need to see the dollar fall further.' Mr Toohey said the impact of the end of the mining boom will be worse than experts are currently predicting .","Tim Toohey, head of economics at Goldman Sachs, predicts the Australian economy will struggle in 2015 .

"Chancellor George Osborne has warned the British economy is not immune from the eurozone crisis . George Osborne yesterday warned that the British economy was at a ‘critical’ juncture as the eurozone plunged deeper into crisis. The Chancellor said the UK was feeling the impact of the slowdown on its main trading partner amid warnings the single currency bloc faced a ‘lost decade’ like the one seen in Japan in the 1990s. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the eurozone risked a devastating double-whammy of recession and deflation. In her intervention at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank at their headquarters in Washington, she warned that the region faced full-blown recession if politicians failed to act now. It came as Germany, Europe’s largest economy, suffered its biggest fall in exports for more than five years. Exports tumbled 5.8 per cent in August – fuelling fears of recession across the region. And a separate report showed German industrial output slumped 4 per cent in the same month – also the worst performance for five years. Mr Osborne said the UK economy was slowing as the worsening situation on the Continent took its toll. ‘This is a critical moment for the British economy,’ he said. ‘The eurozone risks slipping back into recession. Britain cannot be immune from that. Indeed, it’s already having an impact on our manufacturing and our exports.’ Yesterday the Bank of England held interest rates at 0.5 per cent in a sign that it did not think Britain was ready to withstand higher borrowing costs. This week the IMF slashed its growth forecasts for the eurozone and said there was a 40 per cent chance of recession – which would be the third since the financial crisis six years ago. It also warned of a devastating bout of deflation or falling prices that would delay spending, hit profits and cost jobs. Japan suffered a lost decade of stagnation and falling prices from which it never fully recovered. Christine Lagarde, manager of the International Monetary Fund, said there was a 'serious risk' the eurozone was heading towards recession if nothing was done to stop the slowdown . Asked yesterday if the eurozone was ‘the new Japan’, Miss Lagarde said: ‘We have alerted to the risk of persistent low inflation, which is one of the attributes of what you have described as the new Japan. 'We have also alerted to the potential risk of recession in the eurozone. We are not suggesting the eurozone is heading toward recession but we are saying there is a serious risk of that happening if nothing is done.’ At loggerheads: Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande have clashed over EU austerity rules . French President Francois Hollande has issued a plea to Angela Merkel to ease austerity rules, claiming they could stifle growth. He also said the EU should provide £16billion to boost jobs over the next six years. ‘If everyone practises austerity, which isn’t the case with France, we’ll end up with an even greater slowdown,’ Mr Hollande told a jobs summit in Milan. The socialist president is under immense pressure after admitting France would break EU rules against running a budget deficit of more than 3 per cent of national income. France now faces having its budget torn up by the European Commission this month. But the German Chancellor rejected Mr Hollande’s calls, insisting the rules should be met.","International Monetary Fund warns eurozone faces full-blown recession .

The peerless poacher duly completed a hat-trick amid a relentless rout that saw Ferguson’s collection of part-time players five down by the break. It just so happened that Monday was Boyd’s 31st birthday. You get the feeling he wouldn’t have wanted to celebrate in any other way. After an incredible 127 goals in his first Rangers stint between 2006 and 2010, he was now back in the old routine to aid a cruise into the quarter-finals of the Petrofac Training Cup. Ally McCoist will be hoping it also sparks Boyd to provide the potency required to buoy their Championship challenge. With doubles from Lee McCulloch and Lewis Macleod, and a further strike from Fraser Aird, this became a gruelling evening for Ferguson and his charges. Numerous members of the League Two side had turned in a shift in their respective trades before heading to Ibrox and tugging on their boots. Come full-time, they could at least take the slimmest sliver of consolation from Kevin Watt’s last-gasp reply. Yet the resounding scoreline was not the only notable statistic to emerge last night. The attendance of 11,190 was the lowest at Ibrox since the Graeme Souness revolution of 1986. It made for an atmosphere far removed from some of the high-octane occasions Ferguson once savoured. Tough to take: Clyde player-manager, and former Rangers midfielder, Ferguson looks on during the 8-1 defeat . His last appearance as a player at the Govan ground had come against Aberdeen in May 2009. By that point, of course, his number was up after upsetting manager Walter Smith with his role in the Boozegate fiasco while on Scotland duty a couple of months earlier. That foolish incident – when Ferguson and Allan McGregor had a booze binge at the national team hotel before compounding their felony with childish v-signs at photographers – cast a shadow over his second spell at the club. Yet his achievements remain remarkable. Before exiting to Birmingham City, Ferguson signed off by lifting the Scottish Cup for a fifth time with victory over Falkirk at Hampden. Added to five league titles and five League Cups, not to mention reaching the 2008 UEFA Cup final, he stands as one of the most successful Rangers players in the modern era. A total of 431 appearances produced 61 goals. Ferguson had insisted pre-match that he would attempt to take the game to McCoist’s men and duly set out his side in a bold 4-3-3 formation. Their optimism didn’t last long. By half-time, he was doubtless wishing he had taken a far more cautious approach with a group of players whose Rangers links extended well beyond the dug-out. Scott McManus, a nephew of Walter Smith, spearheaded their attack. Gordon Durie’ s son Scott filled the right-back role. On the left wing was Scott Ferguson, an old friend of Macleod’s from the Murray Park youth system. They were soon completely swamped by the superior quality of their hosts. Jamie Barclay had already turned away a powerful drive from Aird before being beaten with 15 minutes on the clock. Frustratingly for the Ferguson, it was a concession with its roots in a Clyde attack. His namesake Scott fired a shot across the Rangers goal before the threat floundered. Nicky Clark collected the ball deep inside his own half and drove fully 50 yards before dabbing a pass through for Boyd. His first-time finish was perfectly placed into the far corner of the net. The lead was doubled eight minutes later. A well-weighted pass from Macleod released Lee Wallace on the left. His low cross was dummied by Boyd and Aird stepped in with a low drive that Barclay couldn’t keep out. Boyd then claimed his second after 32 minutes following a lovely little interchange. Macleod rolled the ball across the area after being gifted possession by Durie. Boyd ran over it and spun into space, collecting the return from Clark and stroking another first-time shot inside the post. McCulloch lashed home eight minutes before the break, but the skipper was outdone in the long-range stakes on the stroke of half-time. Old pals: Frontman Boyd shakes hands with former team-mate Ferguson . He help steer Aird’s pass into the path of Macleod and watched in admiration as the 20-year-old curled a terrific 25-yard effort beyond the despairing Barclay. Steve Simonsen was in for Cammy Bell at the opposite end and was enjoying a far easier outing than his last cup tie, when he endured a nightmare in Dundee United’s Scottish Cup success here in April. Ferguson hoped to finally bring Simonsen into action with a triple substitution at the break, but the flow of the game was soon flooding back towards Barclay. Rangers replacement Dean Shiels, on for Clark, set up Macleod for another lovely strike on 65 minutes – this time angled low across the Clyde goalkeeper. McCulloch then sent an unstoppable blast from 20 yards into the top corner of the net after 77 minutes before Boyd rounded off his treble two minutes later. Yet again, it was the calmest of conversions. When Watt burst through in the final moments to zip a shot high past Simonsen, the veteran Englishman looked furious at being left exposed. Yet the remaining Rangers fans simply broke into a charitable round of applause for opponents stuck through the wringer by Boyd and his cohorts.","Kris Boyd scores hat-trick as Rangers beat Clyde 8-1 in Petrofac Training Cup third round .

"Fleetwood are the only team still to have a 100% record in Sky Bet League One as a 2-0 win over Scunthorpe sent Graham Alexander’s men top of the table. The Cod Army are playing in the third tier for the first time in their history after six promotions in nine years and their remarkable ascent shows no sign of slowing with Jamie Proctor and Gareth Evans scoring the goals at Glanford Park. Fleetwood were one of five teams to have won two out of two but the other four clubs - Peterborough, Bristol City, Chesterfield and Crawley - all hit their first stumbling blocks. Posh were defeated 2-1 by Sheffield United, who had lost both of their opening contests. Jose Baxter’s opener gave the Blades a first-half lead, and although it was later cancelled out by Shaun Brisley’s goal, Ben Davies snatched a winner six minutes from time.

Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe scored the only goal of the game just after the break. Meanwhile, Crawley lost their unbeaten status, while Bradford maintained theirs, thanks to a 3-1 win for the Bantams. James Hanson became the first player to score against Crawley this season after 49 minutes before Joe Walsh equalised five minutes later. Heads up: Bristol City's Korey Smith (left) and Leyton Orient's Lloyd James go up for a header . But strikes from Billy Knott and Mason Bennett sealed an impressive away win Phil Parkinson's men. Bradford are now second behind Fleetwood after Doncaster’s stoppage-time equaliser meant Preston, for whom Joe Garner signed a new contract earlier on Tuesday, were held to a 1-1 draw which slipped them down the table. Chris Humphrey looked to have secured the points for the Lilywhites but Nathan Tyson struck a last-gasp leveller. Stand-in striker Matt Done scored a hat-trick for Rochdale in the evening’s high-scoring affair as Crewe were hammered 5-2. Marcus Haber marked his full Railwaymen debut with a brace but Done’s treble and goals from Ian Henderson and Peter Vincenti helped Keith Hill’s men to a big away victory. There were plenty of goals between Coventry and Barnsley too in a 2-2 draw with all four goals coming in the first half. Josh McQuoid and Jordan Clarke twice gave the Sky Blues the lead, but the Tykes earned a point thanks to strikes from Conor Hourihane and Leroy Lita. Notts County recorded a 2-1 home win over Colchester with Ronan Murray and Liam Noble on target. Freddie Sears replied for Colchester. James Wilson's second half equaliser earned Oldham a points against Port Vale after Tom Pope's opener and Yeovil claimed a 2-1 away victory at Walsall with Kevin Dawson striking a late winner. Tom Bradshaw had equalised after veteran James Hayter gave the Glovers the lead. Finally, Swindon held Gillingham to a 2-2 draw thanks to Stephen Bywater’s last-minute own goal. Danny Kedwell and Kortney Hause twice gave the Gills the lead but Andy Williams pulled Swindon level before Bywater dropped Raphael Branco's cross into his own net.","Fleetwood top of League One after 2-0 win at Scunthorpe .

"The smoke signals that Cesc Fabregas was ready for a return to the Premier League first emerged last summer, when Manchester United made a public play for the Spanish midfielder. All was not well at Barcelona and the then English champions offered an appetising proposal. Fabregas said as much to friends in London. David Moyes spoke positively in knowledge of Ed Woodward’s pursuits. But plates shift and Tata Martino’s arrival at the Nou Camp, coupled with the offer of increased football in his favoured role, provided Fabregas with a reason to stay at least another 12 months. The potential was there however. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cesc Fabregas scoring for Chelsea . New in blue: Cesc Fabregas played his first competitive match for Chelsea on Monday night at Burnley . On the ball: Fabregas made an impressive Premier League debut for the Blues at Turf Moor . Focused: Fabregas arrives at Turf Moor on Monday as he listens to music on his headphones . Arsene Wenger always maintained he believed any move back to Britain would come this summer and it appeared he was speaking securely ahead of Arsenal triggering their £25million first option. But then Wenger smashed open the piggy bank that had been preserved to meet the cost of the Emirates Stadium and bought Mesut Ozil for £42.5m. During the World Cup in Brazil, Fabregas revealed it was the Germany star’s presence that meant an emotional return to Arsenal was no longer viable. ‘We talked with Wenger but he said that he would find it difficult to make a place for me on the pitch as Ozil had my position covered,' Fabregas said. At 27 years old, entering his peak, remaining in Catalonia was no longer possible either, though. Signed in 2011 as an eventual replacement for the legendary Xavi, the plan never ran its course because Xavi kept on playing. Fabregas would instead feature out wide, up front, and in the No 10 position; effectively anywhere but the deeper role he cultivated at Arsenal.

He would burst forward and affect matches with dynamism for Wenger, but Barcelona’s style, built on stranglehold possession and meticulous build-up, rarely afforded the kind of counter-attacking opportunity that Fabregas would gleefully seize. As such, Barca never saw him at his best, fans would wonder his worth, and big matches came and went without his involvement. ‘If you play one game, the next, and the next but then comes the big game away to Bayern Munich and we are losing 4-0 and you are not even warming up then it gets you down,’ he told Sportsmail at the start of last season when asked about the disappointment of missing out on Barca’s 2012-13 Champions League run. ‘It’s all about continuity. It’s more mental than anything else. Everyone knows Xavi and Iniesta are very good. I know what I can do, but sometimes you think, “Come on, give me a chance boss”.’ Fabregas would add: ‘In England, you always have that extra bit of freedom as a player. You know that, if you misplace a pass, the fans are going to support you. And, in my case, it was a bit different because the supporters saw in me someone who had been at the club as a kid, left and then returned for a big fee.’ Dominance: This heat map shows how impressive Fabregas' performance was at Turf Moor on Monday .

Home: Fabregas (centre) never produced his best at Barcelona due to the Catalan club's style of play . Put it here: Fabregas shakes the hand of Barcelona team-mate Neymar during a friendly in Bangkok last year . In that light the £30m transfer to Chelsea smacks as obvious. Jose Mourinho’s footballing philosophy will provide Fabregas with a platform to play his way, while the club’s fans will enjoy each assist or goal that little bit more given it will hurt those in north London who used to sing his name. ‘There were some very good options and I chose between the best two or three,' said Fabregas. ‘I spoke with Jose Mourinho and he said what I wanted to hear and things went very quickly from there.’ For Chelsea, securing a creative midfielder with the passing vision and range of the Spaniard this summer was just as vital as getting a striker of genuine class. For all the talents of Eden Hazard, Oscar and Andre Schurrle, Fabregas offers a different element; a midfield foundation of presence and poise – a catalyst to change defence into attack. He is also well versed in the physicality and pace of the Premier League. Tracking back: Fabregas chases Lionel Messi during Arsenal's Champions League clash with Barca in 2011 . Key man: Fabregas celebrates with fellow Gunner Samir Nasri after Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in 2011 . Mentor: A young Fabregas with former boss Wenger at Arsenal's training ground in London Colney . That much was evidenced at Turf Moor, as Fabregas returned to the Premier League after a three-year absence as if he had never been away. The pass for Schurrle’s goal took the breath away, the clearest illustration of what he had been unable to do consistently at Barcelona. But it was his stature and composure across the pitch that will have pleased Mourinho most. After full-time the Portuguese took a swipe at how many positions Fabregas had been forced to fill at the Nou Camp. Here, we will treasure you, was the message. It was an unnerving start that may make Wenger nervous. He must trust that Ozil, a World Cup winner who is in his first full season in England, can prove his value yet.","Signs that Fabregas was ready for a return to England came in 2013 .

"Olivier Giroud is positive he can form a destructive strike partnership with new Arsenal signing Alexis Sanchez this season. Manager Arsene Wenger has talked up the Chilean player's ability to play through the middle as a loan striker as well as from the flanks. But £30 million man Sanchez started out wide in the 3-0 Community Shield thrashing of Manchester City, and Giroud made the most of his chance, firing in the third goal.

Impressive: Alexis Sanchez (left) is pursued by Stevan Jovetic as he produced a decent performance on his competitive debut for Arsenal . The French striker said: 'I have a good understanding with Alexis. It is always easy to play with this kind of player. 'He will need some more games to adapt his game to the Premier League but he is a fantastic player so I think he will do a great season. 'He has different qualities. He can bring pace and technique and he's a great finisher.' Arsenal's title challenge last season faltered partly due to an over-reliance on Giroud. Wenger responded by snapping up 25-year-old World Cup star Sanchez from Barcelona and his new teammate is adamant Arsenal are ideally placed to win a first Premier League title since 2004. The experienced manager has also signed Calum Chambers, Mathieu Debuchy and David Ospina while World Cup winners Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski and Mesut Ozil still to return from an extended break.

From drivers who don't indicate, inconsiderate motorists who tailgate others and those who treat the roads like a racetrack, it seems there are many things that grind our gears. New statistics show that nearly half of all drivers have experienced a road rage incident, while ten per cent of people revealed they have been in a collision with a cyclist. Scroll down for video . A new survey has revealed that Australian drivers are a bunch of hot heads on the roads .

And on top of losing our tempers behind the wheel apparently we don't like to stick to the road rules either. The number of drivers that regularly exceed the speed limit is 23 percent, while drivers who drive too slow are also unfavourable people to share the asphalt with.

"The 'alcopop generation' are paying the price for growing up with widely available access to alcohol . The ‘alcopop generation’ is dying needlessly from liver disease fuelled by alcohol and obesity, a report warns. Experts say young Britons are paying the price of growing up with cheap drink available round the clock. A report by Public Health England today calls for tackling liver disease to be made a national priority because ‘young lives are being needlessly lost’. There are nearly 11,000 deaths from liver disease a year in England, including victims in their 20s. This rate has increased by 40 per cent in a little over a decade even though it is falling everywhere else in Europe. The report warns that in some areas of the country the death rate for men is four times higher than others due to differing levels of alcohol and obesity. Blackpool and Manchester have the highest rates at 58.4 per 100,000 people and 54.9 per 100,000 respectively. At the other end of the scale Central Bedfordshire has just 13 per 100,000 and Hertfordshire has 13.6 per 100,000. Professor Julia Verne, Lead for Liver Disease at Public Health England, said: ‘Liver disease is a public health priority because young lives are being needlessly lost. ‘Liver disease is needlessly killing young people, people of working age. ‘We must do more to raise awareness, nationally and locally, and this is why it is so important for the public and health professionals to understand their local picture.’ Scroll down for video . Emily Robinson, Deputy Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern said: ‘The country is in danger of losing the battle against liver disease, which goes against the trend in much of the rest of Europe where many of our neighbours are actually making progress. ‘It’s a tragedy that we’re actually seeing cases of young people in their twenties dying of alcoholic liver disease, when this can be prevented. ‘The so called ‘alcopops generation’ have grown up in a society where alcohol is available at almost anytime, anywhere, at incredibly cheap prices and promoted nonstop.’ A report found there are nearly 11,000 deaths from liver disease a year in England, including victims in their 20s . The report shows that areas with the highest death rate have the most pubs for their population. In Blackpool there is one pub to 72 people compared to one pub for 281 people in Hertfordshire. Figures show that the number of people who died from liver disease in England rose from 7,841 in 2001 to 10,948 in 2012. Andrew Langford, Chief Executive of The British Liver Trust, said: ‘These profiles, which were urgently needed, will begin to address the devastating rise of poor liver health throughout the country and reduce unnecessary deaths of increasingly younger people from liver disease.’","Young Britons paying price of growing up with widely available cheap drink .

"Joseph Newton (pictured) stole the cash from his father Derek Newton while on bail for burgling his flat in Ipswich, Suffolk, just two weeks earlier . A father almost died of a heart attack while chasing his son after the thief stole £20 from him, a court heard. Joseph Newton, 23, stole the cash from his father Derek Newton, 62, while on bail for burgling his flat in Ipswich, Suffolk, just two weeks earlier. Derek Newton had a history of serious heart problems and had to be airlifted to hospital as he fought for life after collapsing as he pursued his son. He had to have emergency treatment at Norfolk and Norwich Hospital following the drama on the afternoon of August 17. He has since been allowed to go home after his ordeal, a court heard. Newton, who has been jailed for 20 months, was 'sorry' for his actions, Ipswich Crown Court was told. Mr Newton was found by his horrified daughter slumped in his back garden after being struck down by a suspected cardiac arrest. Just 16 days before the theft, Newton had broken in to his father's home in the early hours and stolen £20. He went to see his frail father on August 17 and was told to go away. Newton appeared to be very upset but returned in the next 30 minutes. He then ran out with a £20 note. His father chased him for a couple of minutes shouting 'come back, come back' before collapsing, the court heard. Newton was jailed for 16 months for the burglary and given a consecutive four-month sentence for theft. The repeat offender admitted burglary and theft at an earlier hearing at the town's magistrates' court. Newton, of no fixed address, told the crown court: 'The last words I said to the magistrates' court were ""could you tell my dad I'm sorry""'. He had feared his father was dying and was desperate to see him, the court heard. Newton had a difficult relationship with his father, the court heard. His defence lawyer, Lynne Shirley, said: 'He is remorseful. Derek Newton had a history of serious heart problems and had to be airlifted to hospital as he fought for life after collapsing as he pursued his son in Burlington Road (pictured) in Ipswich, Suffolk . 'He has pleaded guilty. 'He has saved his father and his sister the difficult ordeal of giving evidence in a trial. 'He's very upset and obviously concerned about his father. 'It was certainly not his intention for him to come to any harm.' She added: 'He says ""I wish I could have contact with my dad. I wish I could say sorry"". 'He is a young man not without hope. 'He wants to join the army and that's what he was going through the process of before these offences were committed.'","Joseph Newton, 23, stole the cash from his 62-year-old father Derek Newton .

"Never buy a player on the back of a good World Cup used to be the maxim in football, too many clubs having been deceived by a player shining for three or four games with their national team in the rarefied atmosphere of tournament football. However, some players do grow and mature more rapidly in the spotlight and appear to establish themselves as players worth watching by virtue of the fact that they deliver under the highest pressure. Marcos Rojo is one of the above. Going into the World Cup the 24-year-old Sporting defender was widely perceived as one of the weak links in the Argentina team, especially by his nation's press who were unconvinced by his selection in the starting XI. In fact, most would have said he was only there because of the lack of a suitable alternative.

He has a degree of flair about him – he cleared the ball in the penalty area against Bosnia by flicking one leg behind the other, a trick known as a rabona in Spanish. And having scored the third and winning goal against Nigeria somewhat fortunately – the ball bounced up off his knee as he followed in a corner - he grew steadily in confidence, nutmegging Arjen Robben in the semi-final and then performing well in the final against Germany. He more often played in central defence for Sporting which is probably why he is attracting Louis van Gaal’s attention as a potential left-sided player in a back three or as a left-sided wing back. And he is quick – the FIFA stats had his top speed down as quicker than Robben's in the semi-final against Holland. Born in La Plata, 45 miles from Buenos Aires, down the River Plate, he came up through the ranks at the Estudiantes La Plata, the club most-closely associated with former United midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron. Dream team: Rojo celebrates winning the Argentine league title with team-mate Juan Veron (left) in 2010 . Enigma: Veron was fabulously talented but his Old Trafford career was blighted by inconsistency and a lack of defensive cover - here he enjoys a highlight, scoring in the famous 5-3 victory at Tottenham in 2001 . Indeed Veron and Rojo were team-mates when the defender was starting out his career, Veron having returned to his home town club. Rojo had a brief spell at Spartak Moscow before signing for Sporting two years ago. VIDEO Rojo hands in transfer request .","Manchester United are hoping to sign Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists he has no regrets over not re-signing Cesc Fabregas despite the Spanish midfielder's dazzling performance for Chelsea at Burnley. The former Arsenal midfielder moved to Stamford Bridge from Barcelona in the summer and caught the eye in helping Jose Mourinho's side win 3-1 at Turf Moor. But Wenger insists he does not regret the decision not to bring Fabregas back to Arsenal. He said: 'I have no regrets that Fabregas [joined Chelsea]. My only regret is that he left us in the first place. 'It was strange to see Cesc in a Chelsea shirt. We have to accept that players move. It was difficult for me to see him leave but we accept he moved.' On song: Cesc Fabregas impressed on his Premier League return for Chelsea at Burnley .

ARSENE WENGER LIVE: Here's how the Arsenal manager's press conference unfolded . Host commentator . Just to recap the main talking points: . - Mikel Arteta out of Everton game . - No regrets on not re-signing Cesc Fabregas . - No confirmation yet on the return of German trio Lukas Podolski, Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil . - Arsenal 'open to any opportunity to strengthen' in transfer market . Arsenal fans would have seen their former midfielder Fabregas impress for Chelsea against Burnley. But Wenger insists he has no regrets on not re-signing the midfielder. He said: 'I have no regrets that Fabregas [joined Chelsea]. My only regret is that he left us in the first place. Wenger added: 'Aaron Ramsey has a different style to Fabregas but he has a huge potential.' '[Man United] have the quality and Van Gaal will get the right balance.

Joel Campbell and Lukas Podolski are among those linked with Arsenal exits. Wenger: 'I will check [whether the Germans] are available for selection against Everton.' He hasn't ruled out a return for Mertesacker, Ozil and Podolski. Wenger: 'We are not in an emergency case but we are open to any opportunity to strengthen our defensive department.' Last year, Everton thrashed Arsenal 3-0 at Goodison Park. The Arsenal boss has just said: 'Everton deserved to win [when the teams last met]. We beat them in the FA Cup. They are flirting with Champions League.' As Neil Ashton reported, Arteta is not fit to face his former side on Saturday. Arsene Wenger has just confirmed that. Still waiting for Wenger, but Roberto Martinez is speaking to the media at the moment... Still plenty of time for some business to be done before the transfer window slams shut (... or closes). You may have read LAURIE WHITWELL's take on Olivier Giroud after the 0-0 draw with Besiktas. Do Arsenal need another striker? I'm sure transfers will be one of Wenger's talking points when he speaks in a few minutes from now. Arsenal have begun the season without their trio of World Cup winners Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski. Arsene Wenger is among those who think that the Premier League season has started too soon after the World Cup and that it should have been more in line with the later starts seen in La Liga and Serie A. Find out how close the three Germans are to a competitive return when Wenger speaks shortly. NEIL ASHTON reported that the Spanish midfielder has been ruled out for the next two games. The Arsenal captain was taken off in the 50th minute against Besiktas after a challenge from former Chelsea striker Demba Ba. With Aaron Ramsey suspended as well, there will be a couple of changes in Arsenal's midfield for the crucial second leg at the Emirates next Wednesday. There's plenty on the agenda for the Arsenal boss this morning as he looks ahead to the trip to Everton at the weekend. Arsenal began their season with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace and then drew 0-0 with Besiktas in the first leg of their Champions League play-off in Istanbul. Wenger saw Mikel Arteta hobble off injured in Turkey and is also still waiting for German trio Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski to return to competitive action after their World Cup exploits. The Arsenal manager will be LIVE from 9am today so stay tuned.","Arsene Wenger has no regrets about Cesc Fabregas joining Chelsea .

"If the people in charge of Manchester United were searching for a serene, unruffled, semi-detached figure to be their new manager, then they may have landed the ideal candidate in Louis van Gaal. Where others might have bawled colourful curses at the inadequacies of this abject United side, Van Gaal remained resolutely undramatic. It was, he said, a ‘very disappointing’ start to the season. Elsewhere at Old Trafford, more damaging verdicts were being delivered, but we sensed that the new man had shrewd reasons for appearing so reasonable. His inherited team’s performance had spoken for itself. Now the whole world knew that reports of United’s demise had not been exaggerated. VIDEO Scroll down for Van Gaal: Our confidence will be smashed down with this result . Serene: Louis Van Gaal sat impassively for the most part as Manchester United lost to Swansea in his first Premier League match . Plenty to ponder: United's many shortcomings were exposed in defeat at Old Trafford, as they lost their first opening day fixture at home in the Premier League era . Discussion: Van Gaal talks to assistant Ryan Giggs in the home dug-out as United slipped to defeat . Sucker punch: Gylfi Sigurdsson scored Swansea's winning goal as United's defence capitulated . There was no reason to raise his voice when his task was so obvious. And so, he could start work with a clean sheet. Anything he achieves will be down to his own efforts. After almost a quarter of a century in football management, Van Gaal understands how the politics work. Throughout the afternoon, he had resisted any temptation to occupy centre stage, almost as if he was disclaiming responsibility for this shambles of a side. He entered the arena with the very minimum of fuss. Wearing a dark suit and a sombre stare and carrying a clipboard, he resembled a senior accountant on his way to an early lunch. The crowd’s welcome was warm and he acknowledged it with a brief, polite smile. For the next 45 minutes he did not leave his seat, gazing impassively at the dire, unfolding spectacle. Time was when a United team sheet read like a threatening letter. Meet the new boss: Van Gaal waves at the Old Trafford crowd as he walks out for his first competitive game . Poor start: United's captain Wayne Rooney reacts after Sigurdsson scores Swansea's winner . Glimmer of hope: Rooney hooked in an equaliser for United early in the second half but they fell to defeat . Sure they had suffered injuries and untimely absences, but this one looked like the kind of side they used to put out against non-League teams in the early rounds of the FA Cup, when the season was wearing and the stars were weary. Later, he would attempt to soften the impression his players had made. ‘In the first half, I saw a lot of very nervous players, people making the wrong choices,’ he said. ‘But that’s Manchester United. You have to cope with that pressure.’ Indeed you do, but that happy day is some way off and he seemed to know it all too well. So he sat and stared across at the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, bearing banners which echoed past glories: ‘European Capital of Trophies’, ‘Sir Alex 26 Years’, and silhouettes of all the trophies which the old chap won. Popular: Fans scramble for an autograph from Van Gaal as he makes his way to the home dug-out . Not impressed: Van Gaal looks annoyed as Giggs makes a point during the match . Downcast: Van Gaal knows there are serious shortcomings with his squad and investment is needed . He would not have been daunted by such slogans; Sir Alex himself might not have won a speck of silver with a back three of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Tyler Blackett. A goal down at half time — ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’, the Swansea singers informed Van Gaal — he walked sedately back to the dressing room, apparently in no great hurry to assault his troops. In fact, he had decided to jettison his back three in favour of a more conventional four; a conclusion he had reached after some 25 minutes. Half time would be taken up in explaining his expectations. There were one or two consolations, of course. Ander Herrera, the expensive recruit from Athletic Bilbao, looked smart, quick and thoughtful, while his new captain Wayne Rooney gave his all, since he knows no other way. Impressive: New signing Ander Herrera looked good in the centre of midfield for United . Work rate: Wayne Rooney gave everything in the captaincy role but couldn't avert the defeat . Fitting in: Tyler Blackett was pressed into action in the United defence after an injury crisis . The Rooney decision offered further proof of Van Gaal’s political skills, since it was not so much a masterstroke, more an appointment he would have found it difficult to withhold. Rooney’s goal, early in the second half, did not rouse his manager to anything resembling emotion. Instead, Van Gaal frowned gently and scribbled a note on that clipboard. Clearly, the fist-clenching, eye-bulging, ‘show ‘em you’re passionate’ pantomime is not to his taste — for which much thanks. But there were times when his self-control must have been tested, especially in the 75th minute, when United conceded a goal which owed much to Swansea swift thinking but also reeked of dim-witted defending. The full implications were now sinking in. He already knew that the place need urgent redecoration, now he realised that the foundations themselves were rotten. He has been required to fight a good many fires in a garlanded career, but this is a rare conflagration. King of Old Trafford: Van Gaal watches on from his seat in the dug-out . Greetings: Van Gaal meets Garry Monk ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford . On the whistle, he took time to leave his seat. He actually signed a good many autographs, then he slapped a few palms as he wandered along the front row of the stands, before shuffling away, still carrying his clipboard. He tried to put it into perspective. ‘It is not good, because we had built up a lot of confidence and it will be smashed down because of the result’, he said. He praised his team’s ‘fantastic attitude’, the way they had ‘tried their utmost’. Then he reflected, more realistically: ‘But running is not enough. You must also use your brain’. It was the closest he came to public criticism, and we sensed that he would have felt foolish had he not hinted at his true feelings. ‘I shall tell the players what I think of them’, he muttered and it sounded more like a promise than a mild threat. For there will be changes, many changes at what they still refer to as ‘The Theatre of Dreams’. And Manchester United have taken the massive gamble that the serene, unruffled fellow with the clipboard is the man to make them.","Louis Van Gaal suffered a 2-1 home defeat to Swansea City in his first Premier League match .

"Tiger Woods has not yet decided if he can play in the PGA Championship starting on Thursday in Kentucky due to his back problem, according to his agent. The former world number one withdrew during Sunday's final round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational because of back pain and returned home to Florida for medical evaluation. 'Way too early. He has to rest and get treatment and then assess later,' agent Mark Steinberg said in a text message to ESPN when asked if Woods would play in this week's tournament at Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, where he won the 2000 PGA Championship crown. Undecided: Tiger Woods is yet to make a decision over whether he will play at the US PGA Championships . Withdrawal: Woods pulled out during Sunday's final round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational due to back pain . VIDEO WGC Bridgestone Invitational - Day 4Â . 'Pointless to make that decision now without proper time to give him best chance. Nothing further today, maybe (not) even tomorrow.' Woods left Firestone Country Club in obvious discomfort on Sunday after hitting his drive on the ninth hole of the final round. He said he was enduring back spasms that had hit him on the second hole. The former world number one, who has dealt with a string of injuries, was playing his third tournament since being sidelined for three months after having back surgery. The setback put in jeopardy his chances of playing for the U.S. in September's Ryder Cup matches in Gleneagles, Scotland against Europe. U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson said it 'doesn't bode well right now' for Woods to be selected as a captain's pick for the team. 'Tiger would be a great addition to our team,' Watson told PGA Tour Radio on Monday. 'As I've said all along, I would pick Tiger Woods if he's healthy and playing well. This doesn't bode well right now. 'I just hope that maybe it's just an isolated problem that he can turn around and possibly play this week at the PGA.' Hopeful: US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson is hoping that Woods will be available for selection . Woods, who has been stuck on 14 major titles since winning the 2008 U.S. Open, has played only six events this season with his best result a tie for 25th at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. He has withdrawn twice from tournaments and missed the cut in another. Prior to the Bridgestone, the 38-year-old Woods finished 69th at the British Open after closing with a 75 for a six-over-par total of 294. 'It concerns me because that's an injury that seems like he tried to address before and he's come back from that particular injury,' said Watson. The U.S. Ryder captain said he sent Woods a text to tell him he was sorry about the injury, and 'I hope you get well soon.'Â .","Woods undecided on whether he can play at US PGA Championship .

"The way neurons are interconnected in the brain is complicated. But now scientists have created a new type of computer model to make artificial networks of nerve cells found in the hippocampus region of the brain. The hippocampus helps us form personal memories, and it is hoped  the tool will shed more light on how these memories develop as they move through the region's different structures. Scientists have created a new type of computer model to make artificial networks of nerve cells in the hippocampus part of the brain. A model of a rat's hippocampus is pictured, with different colours denoting different regions. It is hoped the tool will shed more light on how the hippocampus forms memories . Scientists will also explore how the structure connects to the the brain, and which information arrives where and when, using models. The model has been created by Dr Martin Pyka and his colleagues from the Mercator Research Group in Germany. Dr Pyka developed a method that allows the brain's anatomic data and neurons to be reconstructed as a 3D model. Once built, this 3D model can be manipulated on a computer. The hippocampus enables humans to navigate space securely and to form personal memories. The region is seahorse shaped and is shaded in red in this illustration . Researchers from the Mercator Research Group in Germany, developed the method that means the brain can be constructed as a 3D model, and can be manipulated on a computer (pictured). Structures that form a rat's hippocampus, including CA1, CA3, subiculum and entorhinal cortex are pictured in blue, red, yellow and green . The hippocampus is a major part of the brains of humans and other vertebrates. It is named after its resemblance to a seahorse, with hippos meaning horse in Greek. It is located in the medial temporal lobe. The hippocampus belongs to the limbic system and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from the short-term memory to the long-term memory. Rodents use the brain region for spatial memory and navigation. In Alzheimer's disease, the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to be damaged, leading to memory loss and disorientation. They claim that their approach is unique because it enables automatic calculation of the neural interconnection based on their position inside the space. Scientists can generate feasible network structures more easily than using other tools. They are using the models to monitor the way neural signals spread throughout the network time-wise, according to the study published in the journal Frontiers in Neuroanatomy. Dr Pyka has, so far, found evidence that the hippocampus' form and size could explain why neurons in those networks fire in certain frequencies. In future, this method may help us understand how animals, for example, combine various information to form memories within the hippocampus, in order to memorise food sources or dangers and to remember them in certain situations. The researchers have so far shown off a model of a rat’s hippocampus including its different layers such as the CA1 and CA3 regions, the subiculum and entorhinal cortex.

"Johnathan Szabo, 24, has been jailed on charges he set fire to the Pennsylvania store where he worked . A man has been jailed on charges he set fire to the Pennsylvania discount store where he worked, starting a blaze that did $2 million in damage to a strip mall. When asked to comment after his arraignment Monday, Johnathan Szabo, of Charleroi, said simply, 'Sorry.' Rostraver Township police say Szabo worked at the Dollar General store in the Tri-County Plaza. They say he picked up a cigarette lighter from a shelf and began setting fire to paper products about 6:45pm Friday. There were several customers and employees in the store at the time, who all got out safely. Police said the blaze damaged the structure 'to the point that the roof was in danger of collapsing on emergency personnel.' Surrounding businesses also sustained damage as a result of smoke and water and the Tribune Review reports that ten stores in the plaza remained closed for the duration of the night. Police say Szabo confessed and even gave a reason for setting the fire, but they declined to disclose it until Szabo's preliminary hearing November 7.

"An empty fridge is the worst thing to come home to after a relaxing holiday or a flight across several time zones. But for those who don't have the energy or time to stop by a supermarket with luggage in tow, a new service is popping up at airports. With an eye on a small but emerging market, retailers are taking advantage of weary travellers’ hectic schedules by launching click-and-collect services that allow holidaymakers to order groceries from abroad and pick them up when they land at the airport. Special delivery: Finnish grocery chain HOK-Elanto has set up click-and-collect lockers at Helsinki Airport . Airport grocery collection points are a growing trend in Europe and  Waitrose has announced plans to set up its own refrigerated lockers at long-stay car parks at London Gatwick Airport. The convenient system is incredibly simple to use – holidaymakers place an order on their smartphone or another device before flying home and, using a code sent to their mobile after paying, retrieve the delivered items without having to divert to a store. London Underground and Network Rail have both announced plans to turn their stations into pickup points for a host of different retailers, from Sainsbury’s to New Look. Last week, Finnish grocery store chain HOK-Elanto and e-commerce firm Digital Foodie launched the helpful service for travellers or employees at Helsinki Airport. An empty fridge is the worst thing to come home to after a relaxing holiday or a long-haul flight . HOK-Elanto’s pickup point is located in the arrivals hall and it operates almost around the clock six days a week, although it is located next to a store that sells fruit and vegetables and other items. Customers are charged a pickup fee of €5 (£3.90) and must give at least three hours’ notice when submitting an order. Each compartment has its own refrigerator or freezer and is opened with a code sent via text message. Land and go: Waitrose has announced plans to offer click-and-collect lockers at London Gatwick Airport . Jukka Ranua, e-commerce manager of HOK-Elanto, said in a statement: ‘With approximately 42,000 passengers arriving daily to Helsinki Airport we know the new pickup service will appeal to many busy travellers.’ Digital Foodie chief executive Kalle Koutajoki added: ‘Our goal is to ease consumers’ chores by offering a tool for more convenient shopping. Coming home from a holiday or work trip is essentially easier without the added hassle of returning to an empty fridge.’ Dutch grocery store chain Albert Heijn became a European pioneer of the service when it set up lockers at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport last year.","Waitrose has announced plans to offer the service at Gatwick Airport .

"A woman has beaten odds of more than 700,000-to-1 to become the youngest mother in Britain to give birth to consecutive sets of twins - by the age of 21. Annie Gladstone, of Farnborough in Hampshire, had her first pair four years ago and could now enter the record books after giving birth to healthy twin girls. Ms Gladstone and fiancé Rich Porter, 26, conceived both pairs naturally and cannot understand their remarkable fertility, because neither of their families has a history of twins. Annie Gladstone has become the youngest mother in Britain to give birth to consecutive sets of twins. She is pictured with fiancé Rich Porter, their first sets of twins, Jayden (left) and Lillie (right) and holding new twin girls Georgie and Frankiee . Annie Gladstone had her first pair Jayden and Lillie four years ago. They are pictured holding their sisters Georgie and Frankiee . The full-time mother turned 22 just two weeks after non-identical twins Georgie, who weighed 5lbs, and Frankiee, who weighed 5lbs 4oz, arrived five minutes apart on September 10. It made Ms Gladstone the youngest woman in Britain to give birth to consecutive sets of twins. The Royal College of Midwives say they have not heard of anyone in the country having two sets of consecutive twins at such an early age. It is much rarer than having a pair separated by a single baby. Ms Gladstone, whose children now get through 140 nappies a week, said: 'We worked the odds out of more than 700,000 to one, just because it's so rare to not have a ""filler baby"" between twins. 'It's obviously a record I never set out to achieve. I do feel blessed that my family feels absolutely complete at such a young age. 'Now we've just got to get married.' Ms Gladstone always wanted another baby after the births of daughter Lillie, who weighed 5lbs 3oz and son Jayden, who weighed 5lbs 13oz, in April 2011 - and was delighted when she realised in January she was pregnant again. Annie Gladstone turned 22 two weeks after non-identical twins Georgie and Frankiee (pictured) arrived just five minutes apart on September 10 . The Royal College of Midwives say they have not heard of anyone in the country having two sets of consecutive twins at 21. Annie Gladstone and fiancé Rich Porter . The healthy new arrivals, who like their older siblings are non-identical twins, were born five minutes apart after a very short labour . But the couple's joy turned to shock when they had the 12 week scan and were told they were expecting two new arrivals. She said: 'The shock took forever to get over. Rich went white and his jaw hit the floor. 'But now they're finally here, I wouldn't change them for the world. 'I mentally prepared myself for complete chaos at having four children under four, but luckily they are all very well-behaved - most of the time. 'It has actually been a help having twins before because I knew what to expect second time round.' The family-of-six live in Farnborough, Hampshire, where Mr Porter works as a warehouse manager. The healthy new arrivals, who like their older siblings are non-identical twins, were born five minutes apart after a very short labour. Ms Gladstone said: 'The labour was very quick - just over one hour. 'As soon as I saw them I fell completely in love. They are both absolutely gorgeous. Annie Gladstone's baby bump is pictured left on August 10 - a month before giving birth to a second set of twins. The couple were shocked when an ultrasound (pictured right) revealed they would be having a second consecutive set of twins . 'Frankiee looks just like Rich and Georgie looks just like me. 'The midwife told us that since I've already done it twice, we've got a 50 per cent chance of having twins again. 'I know there's nothing wrong with us, we're just probably a bit super fertile. 'Obviously when I fell pregnant at 17 we weren't using fertility treatment, and we definitely weren't this time around. 'We've decided no more after this.' Mr Porter added: 'We've got four girls in the family so Jayden and I are slightly outnumbered these days. 'But he is going to be a brilliant big brother to them all.' Jacque Gerrard, director for England at the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'I have been a midwife for over 30 years and have never seen someone at such a young age have two sets of twins in succession like this. 'As a mother of twins myself I know what she is going through and I wish her all the best. Ms Gladstone always wanted another baby - and was delighted when she realised in January she was pregnant again with Frankiee (right) and Georgie (left) 'Women having twins and multiple births are monitored closely throughout the pregnancy particularly when it is a teenage pregnancy. 'The experience gained with her first set of twins was no doubt helpful when she gave birth second time round.' The family's hectic routine is seeing her get through at least 20 nappies a day, and put on at least two loads of washing. She said: 'I have to follow a very structured daily routine otherwise I'd never get anything done. 'We are all up before 5:45am most mornings. 'Lillie and Jayden play while I get myself ready and then I get all four of them washed and dressed which takes about an hour. 'At 7am I prepare Lillie and Jayden's breakfast and while they are eating I feed the twins. 'When everyone is finished I clean the kitchen and sterilise the bottles and put a wash on. 'At 8:30am the oldest two are ready with coats, shoes, bags and packed lunches ready to go to nursery. 'Then I'm home alone with the girls while Rich is at work. 'The babies feed every three hours so a 900g tin of milk lasts us just three days.

Ausgrid are working to restore power to the homes and SES and NSW Rural Fire Service are responding to storm related incidents from Sydney to the Hunter Valley after the downpour saw intense rainfall, hail and winds. Residents in Sydney and surrounding regions waited in anticipation as the sky turned black, with social media quickly filled with images of the ominous clouds as they closed in. The western suburbs were first hit by the storm front at 6pm, with almost 90 km/h winds and Horsley Park recorded an enormous 12mm of rainfall in just ten minutes. Scroll down for video .

"Karen Livingstone is one strong woman. She's lost her mother, father and husband to cancer but is more determined than ever to continue her advocacy work to push for further medical research in Australia. Yet the pain is still raw for the Melbourne mother-of-two, who as of Wednesday has been the recipient of The Advocacy Award from the annual Research Australia Awards, as she still continues to cope with her loss. Karen Livingstone with her mother Elsie Livingstone, who died of ovarian cancer in 2001 . Ms Livingstone, 49, with her father Ed Livingstone on his 81st birthday this year. He lost his battle to prostate cancer in October . Ms Livingstone's journey began in 1997 when she learnt that her mother Elsie had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Devastated by the news, Ms Livingstone and her sister Nicole dealt with their grief by pouring all their energy into creating an organisation that might one day prevent other families from feeling the same sense of loss. 'We thought mum was okay because she had a partial hysterectomy so when we were told she had ovarian cancer, it had a detrimental effect on our family,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'When you've lost someone in your life, you try and make sense of it and we did this by setting up Ovarian Cancer Australia. 'We didn't want other families to feel robbed, just like we had been.' Her mother lost her battle in 2001, the year Ms Livingstone officially co-founded the organisation with her sister. The 49-year-old dedicated her time into building a support network for cancer victims, their families and also establishing a national day to raise awareness of ovarian cancer. But in 2009 Ms Livingstone's world came crashing down, yet again. Her husband, Dave Grant, had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Melbourne mother-of-two with her husband Dave Grant, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2010 . Ms Livingstone says her husband's death took a massive toll on her two children who were very young at the time of his passing . 'I literally fell on the ground when I found out,' she said. 'How do you explain to your 9-year-old-son and 13-year-old daughter that their dad has a five per cent chance of survival?' At the time she was the CEO of her organisation but made the decision to step down from her role to care for her ill husband, who died in 2010. An immense sense of loss was also felt by her two children Madeleine and Spencer, who are now 18 and 15. 'My husband was only 52 when he died and my daughter was his princess and my son was just figuring out what his dad was all about,' Ms Livingstone said. 'Our children had to watch every day as their father grew weak and skeletal. There was no hiding from pancreatic cancer. 'The suffering for our family didn't end there. The grief and loss felt by our children has been so extensive, four years on they still don't understand.' Since then, Ms Livingstone tirelessly continued her efforts into volunteering for the Garvan Research Foundation to underline the importance of consumer involvement in the medical research process. She's also become a board member of Australian New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group (ANZGOG) to be part of the process of medical research and ensure better outcomes for women going through treatment. But most recently, in October, Ms Livingstone's lost her father Ed to prostate cancer. 'Dad was an integral part of my life and my children's lives especially after Dave died,' she said. 'My father was an amazing person and very protective of us. It was a difficult loss.' Karen Livingstone receiving her Advocacy Award from the Chair of Research Australia, Christine Bennett, and Research Australia Board Member Shelley Evans . Ms Livingstone was recognised for her advocacy efforts in the ovarian, gynaecological and pancreatic cancer research . Having suffered a triple tragedy, the award recipient has no intention of slowing down her advocacy work - even after being honoured at the annual Research Australia Awards on Wednesday night. But she's adamant that she's still, after all, human and is still quite evidently dealing with her loss of her three loved ones. 'How do you cope with so much loss unless you know it's not been in vain?' she said. 'I've lost my mum, my husband and my father. All I can do is look forward and continue to make sure that cancer research stays relevant.' Ms Livingstone hopes to see a change in the medical world, which will make a difference to future cancer victims and their families. 'I don't want to see men and women being struck down by the disease - emotionally and physically,' she said. 'If we have the right support, cancer diagnosis doesn't have to be a death sentence.' Ms Livingstone was recognised for her advocacy efforts in the ovarian, gynaecological and pancreatic cancer research last night and was 'absolutely thrilled to have won the award'. 'I believe that consumers have a strong voice in research to benefit future generations,' she said.","Karen Livingstone, of Melbourne, co-founded Ovarian Cancer Australia with her sister Nicole .

"There are all sorts of games to play in New York. One of my favourites is anticipating people's reactions. Ask for a cup of coffee and chances are that 'Comin' up!' or 'You got it!' will be barked back at you. Once the coffee has arrived and you've said thank you, take your pick from 'You bet!' or simply 'Sure!' Such rapid-fire responses fit perfectly with this pulsating, absorbing city — overtly positive, unambiguous, energetic. It's the energy that's so addictive. Even the seconds counting down at traffic lights to help pedestrians cross the road safely seem speeded up. The police sirens are noisier, the fast food faster, the portions bigger (never order two Caesar salads, and remember that a 'side' of chips will feed a family of four), the beer colder, the teeth whiter, the seasons starker. The real deal: You'll feel like you're on a movie set when you visit New York City . 'New York keeps you going,' is how a stranger puts it after we take our seats at Carbone, a terrific - and currently fashionable - restaurant in Greenwich Village which might be seen as passé in three weeks' time. Talking to strangers is perfectly normal in the Big Bagel. It's as if everyone has just got off the plane and wants to introduce themselves. 'Where you from?' is the enduring refrain. 'A little-known planet due south of Saturn, actually. You?' 'Not sure, but I'm living in the present now.' Living In The Present might be a good slogan to replace the whiskery The City That Never Sleeps. The taxi driver bringing you into town from JFK airport might have arrived here himself only two days earlier, but you would never know it. Or, as Tom Wolfe, author of that masterpiece about Manhattan, The Bonfire Of The Vanities, put it more eloquently: 'One belongs to New York instantly, one belongs to it as much in five minutes as in five years.' Star rating: Sex And The City's Sarah Jessica Parker (right)  loves The Mark hotel's restaurant . Discreet and restful: The Mark hotel is located near Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum . Where to stay? The area is perhaps more important than the hotel, but get both right — as we do — and you'll be richly rewarded. We opt for The Mark on the Upper East Side between Fifth and Madison because we are neither cool nor in our 20s or 30s (or even 40s if you must know) and want to be near Central Park (to run or walk round the Jackie Onassis reservoir before breakfast is the urban equivalent of picking wild mushrooms on a dewy Scottish morning), the Metropolitan Museum and the stupendous Frick Collection. The Mark is privately owned, discreet, restful. Beautiful people glide by in pressed linen and expensive shoes - and that's just the staff. Its restaurant is overseen by chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten and attracts a blue-chip crowd. Sex And The City's Sarah Jessica Parker loves the place. She lives nearby, but still checks in from time to time. Glorious: Take an afternoon walk on the High Line, which was once an elevated railway line from the Thirties . Seasoned New Yorkers will tell you the trendy Meatpacking District on the Lower West Side is already overcooked. But it seems juicy enough to us. On Sunday afternoon, after walking the glorious High Line (the last section of the route, once an elevated railway line from the Thirties, opens next Sunday), a queue forms outside the Gansevolt Hotel and we join it. When at the front, a man wearing dark glasses, an earpiece and holding a clipboard gives us the once over. 'Is there a party going on?' I ask him. 'You bet!' he says. 'Well, we've not been invited, I'm afraid.' You have now, brother. Head up to the roof terrace and have yourself a great time.' One place - perhaps the only place - where New York retreats in on itself is at the National September 11 Memorial. Here, two vast pools with the largest man-made waterfalls in the U.S. are sunk into the ground within the footprints of the Twin Towers. The names of all those who died in the terror attacks of 2001 are etched into the supporting walls. Poignant: One place where New York retreats in on itself is at the National September 11 Memorial . Culture: Mark's visit to the Met opera house coincided with the American Ballet's production of Don Quixote . The September 11 Museum is now open, but has attracted criticism for selling T-shirts, toy rescue dogs and such like. 'Vulgarity with the noblest intentions,' is how a relative of a man killed that day has put it. What's certain is that no visit to New York feels right without making the pilgrimage to this extraordinary spot. Our visit to the Met at the Lincoln Centre coincides with the American Ballet's production of Don Quixote. First, we eat spectacularly well just across the road from the opera house at Bar Boulud. After the show we walk to Columbus Circle and make for the Lobby Lounge on the 37th floor of the Mandarin Oriental, with sensational views. Across the way is a new high-rise where, our waiter says, the penthouse has just sold for $200 million. Fact or fantasy? The two blur beautifully in America's greatest city. A couple of decades ago, I spent three years working here. A fellow journalist welcomed me by saying: 'Whereas in some towns you feel like you're watching a movie, here in New York City you're in the damn movie.'

Neighbours: . The couple, pictured with their son Jaxon, met when Kate moved into the . same street as Darren in Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne . 'Darren was dressed in a black tail suit on with a grey waist coat. My dress was a fitted, sweet heart type, it was lovely. 'We . had 53 close friends and family there and it was magical. Everybody is . really happy that we are finally married. They are all saying it is about time.' The couple, who have a two-year-old son called Jaxon, met when Mrs Donaghey moved into her future husband's street in Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne. Over the past eight years, Mr Donaghey said he had become used to getting abuse about his appearance in comparison to his partner's. 'Lucky': The public voted Darren one of the North East's luckiest men as he scooped the award on Metro Radio . 'For years I’ve had stick about how I managed to woo Kate and it’s not . unusual to be out together and other guys to innocently start chatting . Kate up, thinking that I couldn’t possibly be with her,' said the sales adviser. 'Even when we are out shopping at Asda I get these funny looks from blokes and I know what they are thinking.' Happy: The couple will be going on a two-week honeymoon to Rhodes, Greece, in September . Mrs . Donaghey said her husband had entered them into the 'Punching Above Your . Weight' radio competition following years of 'stick'. 'When . we first won the competition people had been flooding the emails at . Metro Radio saying how strange it was for Darren to be with me,' she said. 'And . when the local press got hold of it even more comments came through . saying how shocked they were that I was with Darren and how ugly Darren . was. 'But for every horrible comment there was at least three lovely comments saying what a lovely family we were. 'People say love is blind and I guess I must be a prime example to that, but to me, Darren really is my Prince Charming.' She added: 'I love Darren dearly and as most people know, looks aren’t everything. We joke about it all the time.' The couple picked up the award live on the Metro Radio Steve and Karen Breakfast Show. As part of their competition prize, they won a two-week honeymoon in Rhodes, Greece, which they will take up in September. Presenter Steve said: 'When they walked in my jaw dropped. She was simply stunning and... what can I say about Darren. 'There was some innocent flirting going on from my side. Seriously though, they were a fantastic couple and we were chuffed to bits to see them win.' Hundreds of couples from the North East entered the Punching Above Your Waist competition hosted by Metro Radio earlier this year.

"Pope Francis greeted women who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II during a Mass at the end of his tour in South Korea. In a poignant moment at the start of the service, Francis bent down and greeted seven women, many sitting in wheelchairs, who are pushing for a new apology and compensation for their ordeals. One gave him a pin of a butterfly - a symbol of these 'comfort women's' plight - which he immediately pinned to his vestments and wore throughout the Mass. Francis said in his homily that reconciliation can be brought about only by forgiveness, even if it seems 'impossible, impractical and even at times repugnant.' Asking them to forgive: Pope Francis greets women who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II prior to the start of a Mass of reconciliation at Seoul's main cathedral . Poignant: At the start of the service, Francis bent down and greeted seven women, many sitting in wheelchairs, who are pushing for a new apology and compensation from Japan for their ordeals . 'Let us pray, then, for the emergence of new opportunities for dialogue, encounter and the resolution of differences, for continued generosity in providing humanitarian assistance to those in need and for an ever-greater recognition that all Koreans are brothers and sisters, members of one family, one people,' he said. The Pope received the butterfly pin from Kim Bok-dong, one of the 'comfort women' who attended his Mass. These elderly South Koreans, many of whom regularly appear at rallies and other high-profile events, are looking for greater global attention as they push Japan to apologise. In an interview with The Associated Press before the Mass, another one of the women, Lee Yong-soo, who often speaks to the media, said she hoped the meeting would provide some solace for the pain she and others still feel more than seven decades after they were violated. Francis wrapped up his first trip to Asia today by also challenging Koreans - from the North and the South - to reject the 'mindset of suspicion and confrontation' that clouds their relations and find new ways to forge peace on the war-divided peninsula. One woman gave him a pin of a butterfly - a symbol of these 'comfort women's' plight - which he immediately pinned to his vestments and wore throughout the Mass . Seeking solace: The elderly South Koreans, many of whom regularly appear at rallies and other high-profile events, are looking for greater global attention as they push Japan to apologise . Historians say 20,000 to 200,000 women from across Asia, many of them Koreans, were forced to provide sex to Japan's front-line soldiers. Japanese nationalists contend that the so-called 'comfort women' in wartime brothels were voluntary prostitutes, not sex slaves, and that Japan has been unfairly criticised for a practice they say is common in any country at war. Many South Korean women have demanded a full apology accompanied by official government compensation. In 1995, Japan provided through a private fund 2million yen ($20,000) each to about 280 women in the Philippines, Taiwan and South Korea and funded nursing homes and medical assistance for Indonesian and former Dutch sex slaves. But some survivors refused the cash because it did not come directly from the government. Repeated wavering since the apology among senior right-wing politicians has contributed to a feeling in South Korea that Japan is in denial and not sufficiently remorseful. Before boarding a plane back to Rome, the Pope held a Mass of reconciliation at Seoul's main cathedral, attended by South Korean President Park Geun-hye as well as some North Korean defectors. It was the final event of a five-day trip that confirmed the importance of Asia for this papacy and for the Catholic Church as a whole, given the church is young and growing there, while it is withering in traditionally Christian lands in Europe. Francis's plea for peace came as the United States and South Korea started a joint military drill that North Korea warned would result in a 'merciless pre-emptive strike' against the allies. During his trip, the Pope reached out to China, North Korea and a host of other countries that have no relations with the Holy See. The Pope will visit the Philippines in January, along with Sri Lanka. In Seoul on Monday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, the archbishop of Manila, said Francis is offering 'a friendly hand to the other countries and assuring the countries we are not here for any worldly ambition, we are not here as conquerors, we are here as brothers and sisters.' Francis laid out these themes from the . start of his visit, which was clouded by the firing of five rockets from . Pyongyang into the sea. North Korea later said the test firings . had nothing to do with Francis's arrival, but rather commemorated the . 69th anniversary of Korea's independence from Japanese occupation. Calling for peace: Before boarding a plane back to Rome, the Pope held a Mass of reconciliation at Seoul's main cathedral, attended by South Korean President Park Geun-hye as well as some North Korean defectors . The U.S.-South Korean military exercises starting Monday and involving tens of thousands of troops are described by the allies as routine and defensive, but Pyongyang sees them as invasion preparation. A spokesman for the North Korean army's general staff said in a statement Sunday carried by state media that a 'most powerful and advanced merciless pre-emptive strike will start any time chosen by us.' Such rhetoric is typical from the North and direct strikes by Pyongyang are rare, although attacks blamed on the North in 2010 killed 50 South Koreans. Before the Mass, Seoul Cardinal Andrew . Yeom Soo-jung dedicated a 'crown of thorns' to the Pope made from barbed . wire taken from the heavily fortified demilitarised zone separating the . two Koreas. South Koreans attend the Mass for peace and reconciliation outside Myeong-dong cathedral in Seoul . 'Ut unum sint' reads the inscription - 'that they may be one' - a phrase usually invoked when praying for unity among Catholics, Orthodox and other Christians but given an entirely new meaning in the Korean context. In his homily, Francis said the Korean people knew well the pain of division and conflict and urged them to reflect on how they individually and as a people could work to reconcile. He challenged them to 'firmly reject a mindset shaped by suspicion, confrontation and competition, and instead to shape a culture formed by the teaching of the Gospel and the noblest traditional values of the Korean people.' When he was a young Jesuit, the Argentine-born Francis had wanted to be a missionary in Asia but was kept home because of poor health. He used his trip to South Korea to rally young Asians in particular to take up the missionary call to spread the faith. He also used the trip to console Koreans: he met on several occasions with relatives of victims of the Sewol ferry sinking, in which 300 people were killed in April. Throughout his trip, he wore a yellow pin on his cassock that was given to him by the families.","Francis met seven women demanding apology and damages from Japan .

"The aim of most singers is to make sure they hit all the right notes when they are performing. But this German musician has shown she can sing two notes at the same time creating a unique and eerie sound. Anna-Maria Hefele has been performing overtone singing since 2005, which is also known as throat singing. Scroll down for video .

The singer is able to perform a constant low note while singing high-pitched scales at the same time . The singer is able to perform one constant low note, while at the same time singing a high-pitched scale. And the result is a haunting sound created just by using her own voice. According to her website, Ms Hefele explains that the style of singing originates from Mongolia, where it is locally known as Sygyt. In an interview with the BBC World Service she explains that she is able to perform the unusual style by maintaining a low fundamental note and singing a higher pitched overtone at the same time. According to her website, Ms Hefele explains the unusual style of singing originates from Mongolia, where it is known locally as Sygyt . As well as being able to perform overtone singing, she can also play a variety of instruments including the harp and didgeridoo . She said: 'Overtone singing is one person singing two notes at the same time by filtering frequencies out of the sound of the voice and making them louder. 'Overtones are found in all human voices.' Ms Hefele has also posted a video of herself performing the technique on YouTube, which has since gone viral and being viewed more than 4.6 million times in just over a week.

"Leeds denied Middlesbrough both their pizzas and a point on Saturday as debutant Billy Sharp answered Massimo Cellino's call to score some quick goals. Boro's request for the Italian dish to be left in their dressing room at full-time was turned down by Leeds - surprising considering they are heavily under the Sardinian influence of owner Cellino - but they had more to worry about than pizza as Sharp's 88th-minute debut goal condemned them to a 1-0 loss. Sharp signed from Southampton on Wednesday as Cellino responded to Leeds' opening-day defeat at Millwall and was immediately told by the former Cagliari owner to 'hurry up and score some goals'. Winner! Billy Sharp wheels away after scoring the winner on his Leeds debut against Middlesbrough . The 28-year-old left it until two minutes from time to obey the command but was in the right place at the right time to finish after Tomas Mejias failed to hold Michael Tonge's shot. The late drama will have left a sour taste in Middlesbrough's mouth for it was they who did most of the running throughout and, to almost everyone in the ground, scored a legitimate opener through Albert Adomah which was ruled out. It was Sharp who would have the final say, though, getting due reward for a grafting performance which nearly brought about a goal after only two minutes. Celebration: Leeds owner Massimo Cellino can't hide his delight after Sharp's last-gasp winner . Did you see that? Cellino makes sure everyone around him knows that Leeds have just taken the lead . Leeds: Silvestri, Byram, Warnock, Austin (Cook 86), Cooper, Pearce, Murphy, Ajose (Poleon 75), Doukara (Tonge 54), Sharp, Bianchi . Subs not used: Smith, Stuart Taylor, Charlie Taylor, Poleon . Middlesbrough: Mejias Osorio, Abella Perez, Friend, Leadbitter, Ayala, Omeruo, Whitehead (Clayton 60), Adomah, Garcia Martinez, Tomlin (Williams 85), Reach (Nsue Lopez - 75' ) Subs not used: Clayton, Husband, Fewster Konstantopoulos . Ref: Craig Thomson . Att: 44,484 . He ran on to a Souleymane Doukara flick and got into the box, only for Mejias to get out and smother at his feet. The ball then came free and fell to Nicky Ajose who, from 10 yards out, should have scored and not hit the recovering Daniel Ayala on the line. That was as good as it got for Leeds in the early stages and they were soon being pinned back by a Middlesbrough side who passed the ball round at a pace quicker than United could deal with and really should have been ahead 26 minutes in. Liam Cooper failed to deal with a long throw into the box and turned to see Adomah overhead kick his half-clearance beyond Marco Silvestri. It looked a clean goal but referee Stuart Atwell had spotted an infringement and chalked it off. Jason Pearce was the next man to put his body on the line to keep Leeds level, diving in front of a Lee Tomlin effort as the hour approached, with Warnock then displaying his defensive nous once more to nip in and block of Kike as he ran through. Leeds' best chance of getting something appeared to be under the suspect handling of Mejias who never looked comfortable under a cross and, with 11 minutes left he failed to reach a Luke Murphy centre but Sharp was unable to punish him from six yards. But the former Doncaster man was on the spot as time ran down, showing the required poise to slot in after Mejias allowed Tonge's drive to slip away from him.

"The power of word association is amazing. 'Let's go away for the weekend to Paris,' I say one morning to my seven-year-old son, George. His little face lights up. 'Yes, dad!' he beams. 'Disneyland Paris!' 'No, not Disneyland,' I reply. 'Paris, Paris.' Suddenly, he's not so enthusiastic. Maybe the French capital isn't the most obvious destination for a long weekend with two young children. Or is it? A new travel company reckons so. Kid & Coe specialises in privately owned rental properties, most of them in urban settings. The unique selling point being that the properties are both child-friendly and stylish. Taking flight: A carousel in Paris, which is full of parks and rides that will entertain children . The company offers houses and apartments in Britain and across the world. Typically, you'll pay about £150 a night - so in most cases it's cheaper than staying in a hotel. You have to make your own travel arrangements. We've come to Paris by train, which couldn't be easier or quicker, and are booked into the César residence in the 13th arrondissement. A former artist's studio once owned by sculptor César Baldaccini - the man who designed the statuette (it's known as a César) that's awarded to film stars at the French equivalent of the Oscars - it costs about £270 a night. We're a family of four, but six people could sleep comfortably. It's fabulous. White and high-ceilinged, with a galleried bedroom which opens onto the living room, there are framed portraits everywhere, and paint spatters on the tiny, twisty staircase. Daisy enjoys an ice cream near the Eiffel tower . The dining chairs are deliberately mismatched and a bit bashed. One is so orange and furry that I wonder if Fozzie Bear has been killed and skinned in order to create it. What's more, it's a real family home. It's only available to rent when the owners are out of town. There's none of that antiseptic emptiness you sometimes find in holiday rental properties. Instead, there's all the family's stuff to use: toys, Lego, a telescope pointed at the stars. We're in a totally untouristy neighbourhood, down a private alleyway, about 20 minutes by Metro from the most famous bits of the city. A recipe for boredom? As it turns out, not at all. Yet, it all starts out badly. Our children have never been to Paris before, so we make the short journey to the Eiffel Tower, which we've been talking about for weeks. But when we get there, the queue is 3½ hours long. Not worth the wait. Frankly, my wife and I are not too bothered. The children moan, but not for long. The best view of the tower itself is from the bottom, I tell them. We grab some ice creams and crêpes, then go for a whirl on an imposing doubledecker carousel a few yards away, and spend an hour and a half on an open-top bus tour. From the top deck, our children (not always the easiest to entertain), lap up their new surroundings - though the bus is shockingly expensive. They also lap up the playgrounds. Paris is awash with climbing frames, slides and swings. There's a lovely local park - the Rene Le Gall - right near our apartment, with an amazing setup of twisty castle, pirate ship, swings etc. But town planners have also plonked swings and roundabouts all over the centre of town. There's some play equipment slap-bang next to the Notre Dame, for example. So it's very easy to do a bit of adult time, then a bit of child time. Home from home: The Graff family stayed in a former artist's studio once owned by sculptor César Baldaccini . And that, I think, is the secret of the trip's success. Using neighbourhood parks - intended for local residents - is brilliant. As is the fact that our home comes with the family's bikes, scooters and French LPs. The next day, in order not to miss out on a rooftop view of the city, we head to Montmartre. One of the highlights of the weekend, oddly, is a busker we encounter there, at the bottom of the funicular which goes up to the Sacre-Coeur at the top of the hill. He blows huge, colourful bubbles above the children's heads. They leap for joy. We eat well wherever we go: steak, duck, snails. All the favourites. Our four-year-old, Daisy, who won't let a tomato pass her lips at home, demands l'escargot at every restaurant. And when it's all over, I feel we've seen two sides of Paris. The world-famous bit aimed at visitors — and a glimpse of residential Paris. Not many tourists can claim to have experienced that combination. The César Residence in Broca, Paris, costs from £270 a night including all fees, and sleeps up to six. Minimum stay is three nights (001 212 905 6065, kidandcoe.com). Return fares from London to Paris with Eurostar (08432 186 186, eurostar.com) start at £69.","New travel company Kid & Coe specialises in privately owned properties .

"As the frogs croaked around us in the utter darkness, all I could think about was whether a moose might turn up beside our circular yurt. The wildlife in Canada is very big. As is the country. Giant animals, huge skies, vast vistas. Quite a lot of mosquitos. Colossal camp sites the size of Wales. And, as it happens, very nice people. ‘I like Canadians,’ announced my son, Lucien, nine, as we bedded down at Kejimkujik National Park in Nova Scotia. Our yurt had everything a camper could desire. Primus stove, can of propane, pile of wood, interlocking saucepans, box of cocoa. A very near-at-hand beauty: Nova Scotia is Canada at its prettiest, and is only six hours away . Canada’s National Parks have ventured into ‘ready-to-camp’ accommodation, as Lucien and I discovered during our week in the easternmost provinces, the Maritimes. Our first campsite was on the banks of the Mersey River. The North American one, that is, which was bursting with long reeds, sparkling water, kingfishers, herons and lots of frogs. Meanwhile, on dry land, flying squirrels and chipmunks skipped about and chattered. Mosquito coils, an outdoor ‘privy’ and a large spider gave us the requisite thrill of being hardily brave, Bear Grylls-style; the yurt’s mattresses and its lockable door were reassuring touches of home. We played cards and read stories. Once the sun went down, we were out of our comfort zone. But that was the point: the shared thrill of the darkness. Next morning was heaven: fresh coffee, grapefruit, maple-smoked bacon and eggs. Could things get any better? Actually, they did, in the form of the improbably named Cody Whynot, an official guide who took us for a canoe trip. Cody looked like a close relation of Tom Cruise - but with a pen-knife. Both Lucien and I thought he was perfect. As he manfully (sorry, but it was so) powered our canoe across the water, teaching us how to paddle, and pointing out the eerie cry of the Loon bird, he explained that even the Yanks had realised Canada was an ideal ‘getting away from it all’ spot. And here's where we put down roots: Lucien checks out the standard of accommodation in Nova Scotia . Is it a yurt or is it a home? Rosie found that the standard of 'tented' accommodation was very high . And us British? Well, as the Maritimes are only six hours’ flight away (London to Halifax), with only four hours’ time difference, the journey is easy. We hammered 300 miles north-westwards to New Brunswick. Here, we luxuriated in an otentik, a wooden and canvas structure, which was extremely comfortable. We went on the Little Big Bear Safari. Did the bears turn up? Yabbadabbadoo. We gazed on half a dozen of them from the safety of a tall tower. There were even several babies. New Brunswick is almost wholly French and is crazy about lobster. En route to the next site, we sailed out onto the Atlantic and learned how to identify, catch and, yes, eat them. Lucien, meanwhile, plumped for grilled chicken. Was Canada all he had expected? ‘It’s a bit. . . big,’ he said, cautiously, as we motored down yet another long, straight road bounded by around 10,000 Douglas firs. Yet the calm of the journey gave us time to sing, talk about football, play I Spy and generally relax. After a terrifying, but exhilarating, zipwire experience, diving 60ft off a tower at Cape Enrage, our final destination was Fundy National Park, on the steep banks of the giant Bay of Fundy. Tom Cruise with a pen-knife: Lucien receives canoeing instruction from the improbably named Cody Whynot . A good holiday thoroughly enjoyed: Rosie and Lucien returned from Canada full of smiles . Here, we stayed in a simple but well-equipped tent. And here was the most magical moment of all. Led by a park guide, Lucien and I (and about 80 other people) quietly walked around a big pond in the gathering dusk. We saw gnawed-through logs, the beaver’s dam, and learned about how these extraordinary creatures live. Just as it was getting dark, there it was, a little, whiskered face paddling swiftly towards us through the clear water. He dived in, showing off his glossy fur and huge wide tail, then popped up again. Yes, it was a beaver; the symbol  of the Canadian National Parks, personally welcoming us to this giant, calm country of abundant wildlife, empty roads and a beguiling air of freedom and tranquillity.

"Forget eating in fancy restaurants, travellers are increasingly opting for meals in private homes for the ultimate 'local' experience, according to a new travel trends report. Predicting the trends that will take off in 2015, a new study revealed that more travellers than ever before will eat local, stay in posh hostels - dubbed poshtels - and use new technology like smartwatches to plan their trips. The popularity of cycling holidays is also set to endanger golf tourism, while Africa has been named the world's new top surfing spot in the World Travel Market and Euromonitor International report. Poshtels: The concept is popular with families and young, business and single travellers . Peer-to-peer dining: Online start-ups are following the Airbnb model to match travellers with home cooks . According to the study, 'stylish and cost-conscious' British travellers are embracing 'poshtels' – affordably-priced hostels that have been giving a luxury facelift and are giving boutique hotels a run for their money. Mixing modern and luxurious design with high-tech facilities, poshtels go above and beyond basic hostels, offering restaurants, twin en-suite rooms, free wifi and breakfast. The 'cheap but chic' concept is a hit with families and young, business and single travellers. It is especially popular among Generation Y, those born between 1981 and 1990 and who embrace mobile technology and favour designer brands. Wearable technology: Iberia and Samsung have create a smartwatch app that acts as a boarding pass . Travel professionals are expecting the Apple Watch to take the sector by storm once it goes on sale in 2015 . And it appears the rise of the poshtel is creating a favourable situation for travellers as budget and mid-range hotel chains rethink their design and lower their pricing in order to compete. World Travel Market senior director Simon Press said: 'Poshtels are more than a buzzword. They represent a viable accommodation option for a number of traveller segments and are helping to raise standards across the entire UK hospitality sector.' Another trend is the rise of wearable devices, such as Google Glass and smartwatches, that are making it easier to plan and manage holidays. A handful of hotels, airlines and travel companies have already released smartwatch apps that act as room keys or allow users to book flights, download boarding passes or find the best holiday deals. The report said: 'Wearable electronics will become an important tool for travellers, who will be increasingly connected to the internet through different types of mobile devices.' Wearable devices are expected to go mainstream and experience sharp growth within two years with sales forecast to skyrocket from nine million devices in 2013 to 180 million in 2016. Travel professionals are expecting the Apple Watch to take the sector by storm once it goes on sale in 2015. The report said 35 per cent of online travel bookings will be done with mobile devices by 2018. One of the emerging trends that will delight foodies is the influence that the peer-to-peer concept is having on local cuisine. Riding the success of websites such as Airbnb, new online start-ups are pairing travellers with home cooks at their holiday destination. Cowabunga: Africa is poised to become the surfing capital of the world, according to the WTM report . The rising popularity of cycling is posing a threat to golf tourism as middle-aged men swap their clubs for bikes . Cheers: The peer-to-peer dining trend is taking off as online start-ups pair travellers with home cooks . Visitors are invited into the cooks' homes for meals or cooking lessons as the websites cater to holidaymakers who are looking for value and more authentic experiences in their quest to sample local cuisine and meet new people. After the meal visitors can review their hosts in terms of food quality, venue and cleanliness. The concept has seen rapid growth even though it hasn't gone mainstream just yet. One of the websites, Bookalokal, was founded in Brussels in 2012 and has rapidly expanded to 20 other countries, while another start-up, EatWith, has expanded from Spain and Israel to 21 cities worldwide in less than a year. Mr Press said: ‘When travelling and on holiday we all like to think that our experience is authentic to the destination. How much more real can you get than by eating local food cooked by a local in their own home, or being taken to a restaurant which isn't featured in the guide books?' The report also said more hotel chains are offering reward schemes to encourage ‘braggies’, where guests take photos in the hotel and upload the images to social media to promote a hotel's brand. Other trends include design tourism in the Middle East, the WeChat messaging app in China, and online and mobile bookings for India’s rail network.","World Travel Market report identified nine emerging trends .

"There's never a doll moment in Sue King's household at Halloween ... especially in the dead of night. For that's when her collection of porcelain playthings come alive with the mischievous souls of deceased children, she claims. The 52-year-old grandmother, from Toledo, Ohio, has amassed 200 dolls in three years, and believes each one is haunted by the spirit of a dead youngster. 'It might sound creepy,' she says, 'but I genuinely believe that my dolls have been possessed by the ghosts of children who have passed away.' So instead of bobbing apples and trick-or-treating tonight, Sue will be dressing up her porcelein babies in costumes of the undead while keeping an eye out for their pranks. Never a doll moment: Instead of bobbing apples and trick-or-treating, Sue King, 52, from Toledo, Ohio, will be doting on her porcelain dolls - who she believes are haunted by the spirits of dead children . Fanatic: Sue, who also has eight grandchildren, first began collecting haunted dolls in 2011 after spotting one at a flea market. She now has more than 200 . 'They're really naughty and are always playing tricks on me,' she said. 'The radio will come on in the middle of the night, or the oven will switch off while I'm cooking. 'Once, when I was doing the washing up in the kitchen, all the cupboards flew open and then I heard a tiny giggle from another room. 'On another occasion, one of them bit me in the shower. 'It's hard to stay angry at them though, because I love them so much.' She says it's her supernatural instinct that has brought her closer to the figurines - who she says she loves just as much as her eight real-life grandchildren. 'I've always been spiritual, and I just have a sense for these kinds of things,' she adds. 'I believe it is my destiny for these dolls and I to be family. I love my dolls as much as I love my own grandchildren, and I know they love me back.' This year, Sue will be continuing her annual tradition of treating her dolls to a spook-tacular Halloween. Once a year, she decks out her house with creepy decorations including spiders, ghouls and hand-carved pumpkins so her dolls can join in on the fun.

"It's the most talked-about show on TV that's transformed a handful of lucky youngsters  from budding singers to fully-fledged X Factor stars. While they may look a million dollars when they grace our TV screens, behind the scenes a highly trained glam squad works like a well-oiled machine to ensure that each and every contestant is HD-ready before their performances. FEMAIL went backstage at X Factor to meet super stylist Gemma Sheppard and hair styling heavyweight Jamie Stevens to discover to secrets behind the singers' transformations. Backstage beauty: FEMAIL went backstage to the Tresemme hair salon where Jamie Stevens worked his magic on Lola Saunders' hair . Amidst the madness - and away from the prying eyes of Simon Cowell - the Tresemme hair salon is a tranquil haven of calm. The salon is headed up by Jamie Stevens, who arrives at the studios at 9am, and has between 10 and 45 minutes to work his magic on the singers' hair. 'The contestants are always being pulled from pillar to post but everyone loves coming into the hair salon,' Jamie told us. 'Everyone says it's the fun room, they speak to us more than anyone.' So close have they become to him that when they film their VT every week speaking about the show, they're talking to Jamie - even though you can't see him on camera. Fun times: Jamie says that the hair salon is the most fun place to be in the studios and the contestants often open up to him about how they're feeling . Get the look: Jamie says he's been championing sleek ponytails, dishevelled party hair and lots of messy plait braids for the girls and the classic quiff for the boys - all modelled by Only The Young . So where does it all begin and how do the contestants' looks materialise from bed hair to beautiful bouffants? Before the shows kick off, Jamie meets with the contestants and asks them two questions: 'What's the worst thing I could do to your hair and what's the best thing?' 'I'm not into making people cry,' he joked. 'When we first did Jessy from Little Mix she hated the colour so we coloured it back. Hair is always hero, it's the main accessory you wear 24/7, you can't take it off like makeup. Not a fan: The team did Fleur East's hair slightly straighter but Simon didn't like it so they had to make it curly again . 'The happier the contestants are, the better it is. If Simon loves it and they hate it, it's no good. They have to feel great.' Every Tuesday Jamie meets with the creative heads and the judges to brainstorm ideas for the coming weekend's show. 'The first year, I had to present mood boards but I've been working on the show for four years so they trust me now,' he said. While he says that Cheryl and Mel are 'great' and let him do what he wants, he has come under fire  from Simon. 'This is the third week and there's been one Simon wobble. We did Fleur's hair slightly straighter but Simon didn't like it so we had to change it back,' he said. 'I think this year is different because Simon's back and because he is the big boss, everyone's a little more on edge.' One contestant who has really noticed Simon's wrath is Lola Saunders. Speaking after the show - and after Simon Cowell predicted she would be in the bottom two - Lola told MailOnline: 'I think I was an emotional wreck but I sort of like hearing the negative comments because it makes you all the more determined. 'Even hearing Simon say I could be in the bottom two made me want to come out fighting.' Speaking about Saturday night's performance, she said: 'I had a complete nightmare, I was terrible. In the rehearsal my voice went and I was panicking because I wasn't in control of it; that was the main issue and it was just horrible.' One thing that's helping boost her on-stage confidence is her glam squad. Speaking about her transformation and style haul, she said: 'My hair and what I'm wearing make me feel so much more confident. I love wearing pencil skirts on the show, they definitely help me. On Xtra factor, I am way more confident and everyone is being really nice about my look and it's all thanks to Jamie and Gemma.' Before and after: Lola Saunders has become very close to Jamie and his team and says her hair and style makes her feel far more confident on stage . Jamie, who works alongside his hairdresser wife backstage, says he's been championing sleek ponytails, dishevelled party hair and lots of messy plait braids for the girls and the classic quiff for the boys. In fact, it's the boys who are the most obsessed with how they look. 'Every year the boys are ten times worse than the girls,' explains Jamie. 'We'll style them at 11am and they'll be back at 12 asking for more hairspray. I've banned the use of hairspray until an hour before the show. We get through fifteen cans a week - just on the boys.' Sharing his tips and tricks, he explains how he 'uses things in a non conventional way. 'We generate a lot of static in our hands but if you spray the hair and they use the corners of the can to smooth it down and dry it with a hairdryer, it works well. Plus, dust in braids is a godsend.' Style guru: Gemma has worked with Dannii Minogue in the past and is honoured to be styling this year's X Factor contestants . Fresh from this weekend's show, Jamie is already planning big things for next weekend - and he is seriously excited. 'Next week is going to be incredible, I'd say the most fun show I've ever worked on in four years. It's Halloween and it's going to be the most Halloweeny the show has ever been, they're going all out.' X Factor may be a singing competition but whether they like it or not, the contestants are also judged on what they're wearing. But they don't just throw on any old thing before they take to the stage; their whole look is carefully constructed with the help of a team of style gurus backstage. Heading up the style squad is Gemma Sheppard, who has worked with the likes of Dannii Minogue, and helps curate each and every look for the live shows. FEMAIL were keen to find out the entire dressing process, who her favourite judge is and how she copes with Simon Cowell's criticism so we grilled the stylist on all things X Factor. Gemma believes that fashion is an 'emotional tool' and if you look good, you feel good. 'It's all about confidence and getting inside of the contestant's heads,' she said. 'It is their closest moment to becoming a pop star so I want that to be translated in what they're wearing.' She couldn't be happier with the group, who make her job all the more enjoyable. 'The contestants really are an amazing group, all very polite and from the beginning we have set a mutual understanding and respect.' As well as the contestants, Gemma works closely with the judges to discuss how they think their acts should dress for the live shows and she hugely admires both Cheryl and Mel's style. She said: 'The girls are gorgeous, they ooze glamour and go for the less is more look with block colours and clean lines. 'Mel's make-up is exquisite but I simply couldn't choose between the two as they're both equally distinctive and stunning.' The X Factor Stylist, Jamie Stevens, says: ‘This week we toned down Lauren’s ombrè colour with a full head of highlights. Her look this week is inspired by fairytale Princesses but we’ve given the classic braid a modern twist to keep her look youthful and playful.’ STEP 1: Prep hair with TRESemmé Renewal Hair and Scalp Shampoo (RRP £4.99) and Conditioner (RRP £4.99). Apply TRESemmé 24 Hour Body Amplifying Mousse (RRP £4.00) onto towel dried hair, working product through from roots to ends whilst blow drying. STEP 2: Divide hair into 2-3 inch diagonal sections, adding hair as you go, keeping the braids the same width, repeat three times. Dust with TRESemmé 24 Hour Body Plumping Powder (RRP £5.50) for ultimate root lift and texture. Secure with pins and tease with fingertips for added volume and thickness. STEP 3: Tong the ends using a medium wand and spritz with TRESemmé Ultimate Hold Hairspray (RRP £4.99) to secure in place . In action: Lauren's look was  inspired by fairytale Princesses but Jamie gave the classic braid a modern twist to keep her look youthful and playful . X Factor judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's lavish diamond jewellery was so valuable she reportedly wasn't allowed to wear it outside the TV studios. Bling bling: Cheryl wore dazzling diamonds, combined with a chic black Zuhair Murad floor-length gown . The TV star looked stunning on Saturday's show in dazzling diamonds, combined with a chic black Zuhair Murad floor-length gown. Jeweller to the stars Vashi Dominguez revealed it would simply be too dangerous for an A-list star like Cheryl to wear such expensive jewels outside a safe environment. He said: 'Cheryl totally stole the show on Saturday with her stunning diamonds. She really showed how you can stand-out by wearing some breath-taking creations. 'But the Cheryl look does not come cheap and there are obvious security concerns if you wear diamonds of that quality outside the very safest places. 'Cheryl very sensibly took off her diamond necklace and cuff before leaving the studios on Saturday. 'I imagine her security insisted upon it, though she kept on her £15,000 diamond earrings.' The singer wore Garrard Wings 10th Anniversary Necklace, which costs £380,000 and Garrard Wings 10th Anniversary Bangle, which costs£65,000.","FEMAIL met stylist Gemma Sheppard and hair stylist Jamie Stevens .

"The World Cup’s Golden Boot James Rodriguez scored his first goal for Real Madrid but it was not enough to give Carlo Ancelotti’s team the advantage in the Spanish Super Cup as Raul Garcia equalised from a corner with three minutes left. It was more a game of two days than two halves with the 11pm local time kick-off meaning the match started on Tuesday and finished on Wednesday and it was on 'day two' that the goals came. Madrid could have won it with their last attack when Mario Suarez blocked Dani Carvajal’s goal-bound shot with his hand but Atletico held on for the draw. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sergio Ramos appear to punch Mario Mandzukic . Bittersweet: Rodriguez celebrates with his new Real Madrid team-mates after scoring what he thought was the winner .

Subs: Oblak, Gimenez, Ansaldi, Tiago, Cebolla Rodríguez, Raul Jimenez. Yellow cards: Koke, Siqueira, Mario. Goal: Garcia 88 . The game, played so late because of Madrid’s suffocating August heat, was a scrappy affair with Atletico Madrid frustrating their big spending neighbours. The match was only four minutes old when Koke went into the book as he went in late on Pepe and the Real Madrid defender exaggerated sufficiently to draw the card from the referee. If the first caution was harsh the second on the quarter hour was completely justified as Siquiera went high over the top of the ball on Bale leaving him needing treatment on the sidelines. Bale it was who had had Real Madrid’s first chance running on to Benzema’s pass but shooting wide of Miguel Angel Moya’s right-hand upright. Against a full-back on a booking this early the night was shaping up nicely for the Welshman. He swept past Felipe Luis’ replacement with another superb first touch as most of Real’s attacks flowed down the right hand-side. As badly as Siquiera was doing defensively he was able to threaten on the break and when he skipped past Dani Carvajal he won a corner off of Sergio Ramos but Madrid are always dangerous on the break from defending corners and only a Juanfran challenged prevented Bale racing away to score. Modric then won two corners in quick succession but saw both cleared by the stubborn Atletico Madrid defence. Xabi Alonso then became the first Real Madrid name to be taken for going through the back of Koke and cards continued to outnumber goal-scoring opportunities. One such chance came just before the break when Ronaldo and Bale swapped wings and the former headed the latter’s cross well wide. Real coach Ancelotti got the biggest cheer of the night with a perfect piece of control from another stray pass that had dropped into his technical area but it was cagey stuff from the visitors and there was no way through for the European Champions. Swinging back: Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo has an effort from range as two Atletico Madrid players seek to close him down . Silverware hunt: Ronaldo was looking to help Real Madrid win their second trophy of a possible six this season . Start the engines: Bale puts on the pace as he looks to speed past Atletico man Koke in the first-half . Ronaldo was taken off at half time as a precaution for a problem in his left leg and Rodriguez came on in his place. With the Portuguese international off Bale picked up the baton forcing a save from Moya at the start of the second half. Having seen Ancelotti put his big summer signing on at half time Diego Simeone waited just ten second half minutes before putting Antoine Griezmann on for Saul Niguez. The tackles, meanwhile continued to fly in with Mario Suarez booked for a foul on Toni Kross and Sergio Ramos and Mario Mandzukic tangling with both going into the book. On 70 minutes Real should have had the lead. Gareth Bale’s free-kick was punched straight back into play by Moya but Kroos blazed the loose ball over from the edge of the six-yard box. Rodriguez then shot wide as Real continued to press. Finally with 15 minutes left Angel Di Maria was brought on. Madrid’s best player last season forced an immediate corner after linking with Kroos who had forced another save from Moya before the change. Kroos it was he finally forced the opening goal. He played in Dani Carvajal who crossed for Benzema and when his shot was blocked the ball ran out to James Rodriguez who found the back of the net. The Colombian's goal looked to have won it but from Koke’s corner Raul Garcia was alone in the six-yard box to poke home past Iker Casillas. It had not been pretty from Simeone’s league champions but they had done enough to take a draw into Friday’s home second leg.

"Worry: The number of young women dying from prescription drug overdoses has risen steeply . Prescription painkillers led to more than 92,000 overdose patients being treated at hospital last year - placing a huge burden on the nation's economy. Overdoses involving prescribed painkillers have become a leading cause of death in the U.S. - astonishingly overtaking traffic and firearm accidents. The figures, a shocking depiction of the the country's relationship with the drugs, were analysed in a report published online in JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday. Researchers from Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University and Rush Medical College analyzed data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample from 2010. Their work found that prescription painkillers, known as opioids, were causing a 'substantial' strain on the country's hospitals, the Baltimore Sun reports. They concluded: 'Further efforts to stem the prescription opioid overdose epidemic are urgently needed.' Opioid drugs - which include forms of morphine, methadone, oxycodone and hydrocodone, such as OxyContin and Vicodin - are prescribed for patients in need of powerful painkillers. But if people take them over an extended period of time, they will often develop a tolerance to the drugs and require a higher dose to feel any affect. This makes an overdose more likely as those with too much opioid in their system can lose consciousness and stop breathing. 1. U.S.A. - 6.10% . 2. Australia - 3.40% . 3. Afghanistan - 2.92% . 4. Pakistan - 2.40% . 5. Seychelles - 2.30% . 6. Russia - 2.29% . 7. Iran - 2.27% . 8. United Kingdom - 1.71% . 9. Estonia - 1.53% . 10. Azerbaijan - 1.50% . It was estimated that hospital care for overdose victims cost around $1.4 billion in 2010 with painkiller deaths quadrupling between 1999 and 2011. In 2009, overdoses involving painkillers actually overtook traffic accidents as a cause of death, and  in 2011 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared the issue an epidemic. In September, Dr Gary Franklin of the American Academy of Neurology, writing in the journal Neurology, said: ‘There have been more deaths from prescription opioids in the most vulnerable young to middle-aged groups than from firearms and car accidents. 'Doctors, states, institutions and patients need to work together to stop this epidemic. ‘More than 100,000 people have died from prescription opioid use since policies changed in the late 1990s to allow much more liberal long-term use.’ U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. recently unveiled a Justice Department 'tool kit' to guide law enforcement agencies responding to drug overdose alerts. Danger: The danger of opioids - such as oxycontin - lies primarily in the fact that they are so highly addictive, say experts . He is encouraging police departments to provide officers with naloxone - a fast-working antidote that can reverse overdoses and prevent death. He said: 'It's absolutely critical that we equip them to respond appropriately.' In 2012, a Los Angeles Times study showed that physicians play a worrying role - their prescriptions contributing to nearly half of all overdose deaths. In response to the epidemic, almost every state has now created a prescription drug monitoring program - so physicians can log into a computer to check whether a patient is getting a dangerous narcotic from another doctor. Blame: A study has shown how physicians played an important role in the amount of prescription drug overdoses - contributing to nearly half of all deaths . In July, America's painkiller epidemic was laid bare in its most stark terms to date as a UN report revealed that U.S. citizens abuse more pills than any other country in the world. The United Nation's World Drug Report 2014 shows that 6.1 per cent of American adults, aged between 15 and 64, abused prescribed pain opioids, such as codeine and oxycontin, in 2012. Shockingly, that figure is twice as high as the world's second-worst offender, Australia, where opioid addicts comprise 3.1 per cent of citizens. The report read: 'In the United States, past-year illicit drug use by persons aged 12 years or older reached the highest level in the past 10 years. 'The number of deaths resulting from prescription painkiller overdose also continues to rise, especially among women.' The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime - who published the report - describe the effect such prescription drugs have on the human body. It's authors write: 'At the heart of opioid addiction is the powerful rewarding effect [that triggers] a cascade of intense pleasurable responses related to the brain dopamine release. 'Users describe an initial rush followed by feelings of warmth, pleasure and sedation. 'Once regular use is established, vulnerable individuals develop an uncontrollable compulsive behaviour that is the main characteristic of opioid dependence, seeking to obtain the substance in spite of any negative consequence.'","University researchers analyzed Emergency Service data sample from 2010 .

"With the Premier League campaign so nearly upon us but many issues still lingering and parts untested, it's time to take an MOT check. Here, Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai assesses the positives, negatives and what the omen could be for the main contenders this season. Chelsea . Reasons to be cheerful: After the moans of last season about not having a striker, Jose Mourinho has landed Diego Costa, one of the most effective frontmen in Europe over the past couple of seasons. Main man: Diego Costa could the answer to Chelsea's attacking problems of the last few seasons . In form: Costa has hit the ground running during pre-season and will be expected to continue in the league . Reasons to be fearful: A season without a trophy means Mourinho is already under increased pressure. He has been backed with funds and needs to deliver. It is also worth keeping an eye on John Terry. He was brilliant last season, but at some point age will win. What's happened over the summer: Chelsea have seemingly plugged the biggest gap in their armour by signing Costa, but more to the point they also landed Cesc Fabregas, Didier Drogba and Filipe Luis, without any last-minute rushing around. They look to be in extremely good shape. What the manager says: ‘We have the squad that we want to have. It is a squad for tomorrow, for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people. So I like my squad very much.’ One to watch: Costa. He was the missing link last season. If he does what he’s been brought in to do then Chelsea will be the only club that can match Manchester City. Omen: Last time Fabregas made his debut in England, his club won the league title (even if he didn’t play a league game). Look who's back: Former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas is back in London after a spell with Barcelona . Manchester City . Reason to be cheerful: The champions look to be in excellent shape. They have the best starting XI and probably the best squad, as well. The signing of Eliaquim Mangala for £32m from FC Porto means they also achieved their No 1 summer objective of landing a world-class centre-back. Reason to be fearful: Their Financial Fair Play penalty limits their Champions League squad to only 21 players. Manuel Pellegrini’s side also have a tough early schedule against Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal in their opening six games. What's happened over the summer: Yaya Toure had the mother of all tantrums because he didn’t get a birthday cake, some unwanted players were offloaded and City managed to spend about £50m. Frank Lampard’s arrival will have also riled plenty down south. Controversial: Frank Lampard made the shock decision to join Manchester City after leaving Chelsea . What the manager says: ‘We've had a lot of problems with Financial Fair Play but we bought some very important players. I don't know what the difference is between Hart and Caballero and Bacary Sagna and Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis, or Gael Clichy and Aleksandar Kolarov.’ One to watch: Joe Hart. With Willy Caballero’s arrival, can he hold on to his place? Caballero didn’t look particularly impressive in the Community Shield, but there has always been the feeling that Pellegrini has his doubts about the England No 1. Omen: All bar one of Manchester City’s Premier League games fall before Toure’s birthday. They have ample time to plan. Manchester United . Reasons to be cheerful: They have a manager who, unlike David Moyes, has the confidence to know he belongs at the club. To judge from pre-season, that confidence seems to have spread through the squad. In Ander Herrera, they have also signed a quality midfielder. One to watch: Ander Herrera (right) has impressed for Manchester United during pre-season . Reasons to be fearful: This squad needed major surgery and so far they have only signed three players, with the £30m spent on Luke Shaw held up as an example of the club badly overspending. The defence needs significant reinforcements. What’s happened over the summer: Regime change and the spread of hope among fans and staff that last season’s debacle was a one-off. What the manager says: ‘Every club where I have been, I have struggled for the first three months. After that, they know what I want: How I am as a human being and also a manager, because I am very direct. I say things as they are, so you have to adapt to that way of coaching. It's not so easy.’ One to watch: Juan Mata. In Van Gaal’s new formation he is likely to get to play behind the strikers rather than out wide. That should better utilise the talents of one of Europe’s best players. Omen: Van Gaal has won the league title with all four of the club sides he has managed. Reputation: Louis van Gaal has won the league title with all four club sides he has managed . Arsenal . Reasons to be cheerful: Arsene Wenger has started spending money and it looks as though he has done it well and early. Alexis Sanchez is a genuinely world-class player, adding to an already impressive attack, and they have also built on their defence. Reasons to be fearful: Olivier Giroud is not a world-class striker, merely a good one, and they haven’t many alternatives for the centre-forward role should he suffer an injury or loss of form. Sanchez or Theo Walcott might have to be reallocated to cover. What’s happened this summer: The squad has got stronger all round. Callum Chambers is an excellent defender with the apparent maturity for Wenger to convert him to centre-half. They still lack the depth of Manchester City or Chelsea. Shining light: Arsenal have splashed the cash again this summer, signing Alexis Sanchez for £30m . What the manager says: ‘There are six or seven teams who are genuine contenders for the Premier League. You only assess the contenders once the window closes. I'm happy with the players we've signed. They have integrated well. I could still do something, I won't rule it out. Numbers wise we are maybe a bit short in certain areas, but the depth of the squad is very good. I'm very excited by this group.’ One to watch: Aaron Ramsey. Sanchez is the star of the team, but Ramsey was consistently brilliant last season. Who knows what might have happened in the title race had he avoided injury. Omen: Arsenal were the first FA Cup winners to lift the Community Shield since 2009. A special vintage, perhaps? Back on the right path: Arsene Wenger has lifted the last two trophies on offer in England . Liverpool . Reason to be cheerful: The club is spending money – roughly £100m, in fact - and really backing Brendan Rodgers. Raheem Sterling is arguably the country’s most exciting talent and Rodgers has Liverpool playing beautiful football. Reason to be fearful: It’s impossible to know how the new signings will bed in, which in turn will dictate how heavily the club miss Luis Suarez. Plus, it’s hugely unfortunate that Adam Lallana got injured just four days after arriving. What's happened over the summer: They sold Elvis and bought The *** fill in with name of good or terrible music group depending on success of multiple new signings *** . What the manager says: ‘Last season was a great step forward and now we must believe that we can go one better. There is only an excitement and a belief inside the club that we can challenge again for the title.’ One to watch: Raheem Sterling. A wonderful talent who could flourish into a world-class player. Omen: Tottenham signed half a planet’s worth of player after selling Gareth Bale and it cost them two managers in one season. Young star: Raheem Sterling has been a real positive for Liverpool in pre-season . Tottenham . Reason to be cheerful: They have an exciting new manager and none of their key players have been taken away. Reason to be fearful: They still lack a proper goal-scoring threat and, Ben Davies aside, there have not been many signings that would genuinely excite. What's happened over the summer: Not a huge amount, besides the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino. Signing Hugo Lloris to a new contract was a significant coup for the club, but beyond Pochettino’s ideology they have not added a huge amount. What the manager says: ‘I know the business in football. I know that you live by the result, you need to get results. If not, you put yourself in difficulties.’ One to watch: Erik Lamela. He did next to nothing after arriving for £30m but there is an excitement at the club that his injuries are resolved and he might be about to come good. Omen: Pochettino is Tottenham’s ninth manager since 2001. He starts his era at the club knowing that Tottenham demand good results. Leading the way: Mauricio Pochettino is looking to help improve Tottenham's fortunes this season . Everton . Reason to be cheerful: Roberto Martinez got the one player he really wanted this summer – Romelu Lukaku. Reason to be fearful: Pre-season results have been less than spectacular and they have a tough start to the season with their opening seven fixtures including games against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool. They also have the challenge of Europa League fixtures and travel. What's happened over the summer: They signed Roberto Martinez to a long-term contract, likewise Ross Barkley, and avoided losing any of their leading lights. A good effort. Breaking the bank: Everton signed Belgium star Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea for a club-record fee of £28m . What the manager says: ‘Progress would be to maintain the level we showed last season while coping with the demands of European football. It is about making sure we embrace the Europa league and use that to develop our potential, but not finding it as an obstacle to our domestic duties.’ One to watch: Lukaku. He was superb last season. Now he needs to do it again with the pressure of a £28m price tag. Omen: The last time Everton splashed big money on a big Belgian (Marouane Fellaini) he did very well at the club. Lukaku has done enough to be considered a success, but what happens subsequent to the big fee will be as important as what went before.","Chelsea should be cheerful with the likes of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas .

"West Ham will be without new signing Enner Valencia for their opening two matches of the season. The news comes as afresh blow to the Hammers following the serious ankle injury to record signing Andy Carroll who is out until December. The Ecuador forward will miss opening clashes with London rivals Tottenham and Crystal Palace. Missing list: Enner Valencia won't be fit for the early games against Tottenham and Crystal Palace . Down and out: West Ham are already without Andy Carroll until December with an ankle problem . Joint chairman David Sullivan told the club’s website: ‘The player we’ve spent the most money on, Enner Valencia, is our big summer signing and he is about two or three weeks away from being able to play, because he was at the World Cup,’ ‘He’s now in full training but I think the earliest he’ll play is in the Capital One Cup match, so it’ll be exciting for people to see him make his debut in that match.’ Sullivan has also revealed the club have made a number of offers for strikers as they target cover for the injury-enforced absence of Carroll. Stoke’s Peter Crouch is the Hammers’ main target, but reports state that interest has also been shown in Hugo Almeida of Besiktas, while Samuel Eto’o has also been linked with a move to Upton Park.

"Felix Magath admitted his £11m signing Ross McCormack is still some way short of full match fitness after Fulham slumped to a 2-1 defeat at Ipswich on Saturday. McCormack, who joined from Leeds at the start of July, was anonymous as Magath's side were well beaten on their return to the second tier after 13 years in the Premier League. ‘Ross came with a lack of fitness, he was not at the beginning of pre-season,’ said Magath afterwards. ‘He is not in the right shape at the moment but he will be the perfect striker for us.’ The Scotland international is likely to be consigned to the bench until he catches up, offering an opportunity for 17-year-old tyro Patrick Roberts to make a name for himself. Fulham were at their most dangerous at Portman Road after Roberts was introduced from the bench with 20 minutes to play and he is sure to feature prominently this season. But who is this teenage talent? Here's our lowdown. Talent: Patrick Roberts made a superb cameo appearance during Fulham's 2-1 defeat against Ipswich . Why all the fuss? Quite simply, Roberts catches the eye with every performance, whether it be for Fulham's first team, their youth team or England Under 17s. Stationed on the right against Ipswich, for example, he tested their back line again and again with his speed, skill and confidence to take on defenders. Entering the game when Fulham were two goals down, he added much-needed energy and impetus and they very nearly snatched a point from the game. Where does he play? Roberts can either play wide on the right, where he regularly cuts inside the left-back to shoot at goal or cross, or behind an out-and-out forward. He is adept at finding pockets of space around the box and troubles central defenders with his direct runs at them. Leading man: Roberts inspired the Fulham Under 18s to the FA Youth Cup final last season . What’s his background? Roberts hails from Kingston-upon-Thames and joined Fulham’s academy at the age of 13. From the Under 14s, he quickly advanced through the ranks and was soon a regular in the Under 18s. In 2012-2013, he scored nine goals in 24 appearances at this standard and last season he got 14 in 27. Roberts has just enjoyed a phenomenal breakthrough season. He inspired Fulham to the final of the FA Youth Cup, the furthest the club have ever progressed in the competition. The teenager scored a hat-trick against Tottenham in the fourth round, a vital equaliser at Reading in the semi-final and a memorable goal in the second leg of the final with Chelsea. It took a miraculous comeback, in which Chelsea scored three times in the final 13 minutes, to beat Fulham 7-6 on aggregate and deny Roberts a winners’ medal. After just a handful of Under 21 appearances, Roberts was fast-tracked to the first team and was named in the squad for the match with Newcastle on March 15 before coming off the bench to make his debut at Manchester City a week later. Magath describes him as an ‘incredible talent’ and clearly felt he was ready for top flight football. With wholesale changes at the Cottage over the summer, more first-team opportunities await in the second tier. The young winger has scored six goals in 11 matches for the Under 17s . What about international honours? Roberts made his England Under 16 debut in September 2012 and has been a regular ever since. He has scored six goals in 11 matches for the Under 17s and won a European Championship winners’ medal back in May. At the finals in Malta, he scored a hat-trick against Turkey in the group stage and a brilliant individual goal against Portugal in the semi-final, before playing a full part in the final against Holland. What are his strengths? Aside from the aforementioned speed and trickery to take on defenders, Roberts has a good eye for goal, a neat first touch and excellent control with the ball at his feet. Weaknesses? Roberts may have to bulk up a little to cope with the physical challenge of playing at the top level, but that will come as he gets older. What happens now? Roberts signed a contract shortly after his 17th birthday that ties him to Fulham until 2016 but as his profile grows, there is bound to be interest from Premier League clubs. He has been earmarked as one of the brightest English talents of his generation and hopefully he will continue to progress and achieve his potential.

"Birthday boy Mario Balotelli prepared himself to celebrate his 24th birthday - by riding on a Segway during his Italian holiday . The AC Milan striker, who turned 24 on Tuesday, drove the two-wheeled, self-balancing vehicle while on his phone as he relaxes in Versilia, Italy.

Balotelli also tweeted a thank you message to all the fans who had wished him a happy birthday, with a link to an Instagram selfie of him smiling away. The controversial forward was part of the Italy squad who were eliminated from the World Cup in the group stages and he has also been linked with a move away from Milan this summer. Liverpool, Arsenal and Juventus have all been touted as possible destinations for the former Manchester City forward should he leave AC. Balotelli, of course, is famous for his mad-cap antics and this latest episode seems rather tame when compared with past misdemeanours. Most famously, while at City he set fireworks off in his house, an incident which came to light not long before a Manchester derby. This led to the revelation of the 'Why Always Me?' T-shirt when he scored at Old Trafford.

"A Cairns nurse cleared of contracting the deadly Ebola virus will remain in hospital until at least Monday while she undergoes further testing. She remains in isolation in Cairns Hospital and will have a second round of testing on Sunday before she is able to return home. Sue Ellen Kovack was tested for the deadly virus on her return from Sierra Leone where she was volunteering with the Red Cross in the fight against Ebola. She tested negative to Ebola after initial results were returned early Friday. Scroll down for video . Sue Ellen Kovack volunteered as a nurse treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone last month . There were fears the 57-year-old, from Cairns, was suffering from the illness she was helping to treat after she reported feeling a fever at 1pm AEST on Thursday. Ms Kovack isolated herself at home on her return, but reported to authorities she had a low-grade fever, as per normal protocol, and was admitted to hospital on Thursday. A Queensland Health spokesman said on Saturday most of Ms Kovack's symptoms had subsided. 'She still has a bit of a sore throat and is tired, which you could expect given the circumstances,' the spokesman said. Queensland Health is expected to provide updates on Ms Kovack's condition throughout the weekend. Scroll down for video . Ms Kovack posted a number of snaps of her on the job in Sierra Leone on her Facebook page . There are an estimated 7,200 Ebola cases in West Africa, according to the latest figures from the Centre for Disease Control . Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young stated on Friday morning that initial tests taken have returned a negative result and it was likely the Ms Kovack would remain under observation for at least another 24 hours. 'This is a necessary precaution given the patient has been to West Africa and has had a fever within the incubation period of 21 days. For the sake of her health and to follow due diligence, we want to be sure she is clear of Ebola virus disease as well as any other disease.' Dr Young said regardless of the outcome of the tests, the broader community was not at risk of contracting EVD. Authorities have moved to allay fears Ms Kovack could have spread the virus, which can only be contracted by coming into contact with secretions of an infected person. Ms Kovack just returned to Australia on Tuesday after a month volunteering for the Red Cross in the West African nation. The Red Cross worker returned from Sierra Leone, via Casablanca and Dubai, then made her way through Perth and Melbourne to Cairns. Red Cross Australia confirmed one of their aid workers was under observation for the deadly virus. 'Our heartfelt thoughts are with the Red Cross aid worker and her family. We will do everything we can to support her at this difficult time,' the organisation's head of international program Peter Walton said in a statement to the Red Cross Australia Twitter page. Mr Walton later told 9News: '[Ms Kovack's] well, I've spoken with her recently. 'We just have to play a bit of a waiting game. 'She's in good spirits - she's feeling good at the moment.' Ms Kovack decked out in medical gear during her stint in the West African nation . Dr Jeannette Young broke the news at a press conference on Thursday afternoon . A friend of Ms Kovack's, Jennifer King, told ABC's Lateline the volunteer nurse was 'popular' and 'well-known' in the Cairns medical community, and her situation had sparked an outpouring of support from her colleagues at the north Queensland hospital. Ms King said her friend of 25 years was used to working in the tough conditions of African nations. 'She wants to help people, she's incredibly compassionate and she's selfless like not many people on earth,' Ms King said. 'A bunch of the nurses [at Cairns Hospital] have gone down to Accident and Emergency [department] to offer to nurse Sue Ellen, which is really brave. 'They're upset and they want to help.' But Ms Kovack's humanitarian efforts have been slammed by outspoken Federal MP Bob Katter. The member for Kennedy - whose electorate takes in the southern area of Cairns and the town's airport - said her volunteering pursuits had put the nation at risk. Mr Katter said it was 'unbelievable and incomprehensive' how a person could get into Australia from an Ebola-infected country. 'There cannot be any compromise with this,' Mr Katter said. 'If you want to go to one of these countries, however laudable your motivation, I am sorry but when you return to Australia, you must be quarantined for three weeks - not home quarantined.' Mr Katter said Australian aid workers travelling to west Africa, including Ms Kovack, were putting Australia at risk. 'We love these people, and we honour these Australians for being self-sacrificing, but compared to the risk they create for our country, it is not remotely comparable. One person's moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to Australia,' he said. But Queensland's chief medical officer Dr Jeannette Young praised Ms Kovack's efforts and said she had acted appropriately when raising the alarm to health authorities. 'I think she's an amazing lady to go to Africa and provide that service,' Dr Young said. She added: 'She has done everything appropriately.' Ms Kovack has been in isolation since she returned home as is the protocol for medical workers who have treated Ebola patients overseas. Dr Young said Ms Kovack had been testing herself in the 'isolation' of her own home and had not been into the Cairns community since she returned on Tuesday. 'This morning she rang up as part of [national health] protocol because she developed a low-grade fever of 37.6 degrees Celsius. 'But we felt it important that she come into Cairns Hospital for Ebola virus disease.' Ms Kovack is originally from Toronto, Canada but is living in Cairns, Queensland . Cairns Hospital where the 57-year-old is under observation and quarantined . Dr Young stressed it was almost impossible that Ms Kovack to have infected other people, including her housemate who is showing no symptoms or passengers on her flight, as she did not develop symptoms until Thursday morning. Doctors awaited the results of a blood test and received the results early Friday morning as the sample had been sent to Brisbane for testing on Thursday afternoon. Dr Young said the actual blood testing process took about four hours. A Federal Department of Health spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia any health care worker who comes back from an affected country needs to monitor their health - including taking their temperature twice a day - and cannot return to work for 21 days. Health Minister Peter Dutton has moved to reassure the public that talking to people arriving from Ebola-hit countries is still the best method of screening for the deadly disease. He said doctors still backed the process to identify and contact people arriving into the country who may have been exposed to the disease. 'I think that's the more effective screening process at the moment, but these things evolve,' he told the ABC. Mr Dutton said introducing a screening in arrivals halls could be problematic. 'It provides a sort of air of complacency if you like,' he told the ABC. 'So people come through, they feel unwell a couple of days later and they think ""No, no, I've just been through that screening process and I wasn't picked up, I'm ok"".' Mr Dutton reiterated the World Health Organisation had not asked Australia for on-the-ground health workers in the stricken African countries. But he said that advice may change over time. Australia will send help if a case presents in the region, for example in PNG, the minister says. 'We would be expected within our region to rapidly respond, and we have the capacity to do that with a team out of Darwin ... and resources within Canberra,' Mr Dutton said. Before she left for Sierra Leone, Ms Kovack spoke to media about her journey, and was actively keeping her friends and family up to date on Facebook. 'I'm a little bit nervous, a little bit anxious but healthily anxious I think,' she told local newspaper The Cairns Post. In an interview with the ABC last month, she said it was her responsibility to help those in need. 'I care about humanity and if I have what people need, I would like to use these skills. 'Why me? Well, if not me then who?' Ms Kovack said. Except for the fever, Dr Young said Ms Kovack was 'perfectly well' but because of the circumstances: 'I am treating it as if it was (Ebola)'. She said there was no risk to fellow passengers on Ms Kovack's flights home. 'She did not have any symptoms at all when she was on those flights, so there is no risk at all,' she said. 'The Ebola virus is very difficult to transmit. 'It's not transmitted through the air - you need to be exposed to secretions: vomit, diarrhoea, blood. 'She doesn't have any symptoms producing those secretions.' Ms Kovack is expected to find out on Friday morning whether or not she has the deadly virus . Ms Kovack recently shared happy snaps of her in Sierra Leone, dressed in quarantine uniforms and being sprayed by decontamination hoses. On September 23, she wrote: 'Big day... Have taken our first bloods from our first ebola survivor at the (International Federation of the Red Cross) treatment centre. It was not the first time Ms Kovack had travelled overseas to help those in need. She had previously worked with the Red Cross in war-torn South Sudan and had volunteered in Sierra Leone in 2002. The Ebola virus has infected an estimated 7,200 people, according to the World Health Organisation. More than 3300 have died. There have been no recorded cases in Australia. Last month, a Gold Coast man was placed in isolation after he was feared to be suffering the deadly illness. He was quickly cleared of the condition.","Red Cross nurse Sue Ellen Kovack cleared for Ebola virus .

"Police officers have access to to the mainframe computers of three of four big mobile phone companies . At the headquarters of every police force in Britain is a small office called the 'Telecoms Intelligence Unit' (TIU). There, police officers can log in directly to the mainframe computers of three of four big mobile phone companies – Vodafone, Three and EE – as well as BT and internet service providers. EE comprises the former networks Orange and T-Mobile, whose police interface was called Plod – an acronym for Police Liaison On-screen Database. Armed with the required usernames and passwords, in a few keystrokes the officers can retrieve confidential data from anyone's telephone or computer use within minutes. Such swift access can save lives by finding an armed criminal on the run, or help track a terrorist before he strikes – but critics believe the ease with which police can access such information has led them to do so far more often than they should. All it takes is a couple of senior officers within the force to sign off the request and any officer can have those details on his screen. In theory, a safeguard system should stop spurious or illegal requests, but with more than 2,000 applications for data access under RIPA being processed each week across the UK, some wonder how effective that oversight can be. When Parliament initially set up RIPA in 2000, it decreed that an investigating officer should first approach a 'SPOC' (or Single Point of Contact) colleague, who is independent of the investigation and trained to weigh up the request for 'necessity and proportionality'. If the SPOC considers it a valid request, he will take it to a designated senior officer, usually of superintendent rank or above, to be authorised. The data is handed back through the SPOC by the TIU before being passed to the original officer. Telecoms security expert Martin Hoskins, of Privacy Consulting, said: 'It's going on every hour of every day. As long as the police have the authorisation for the data, the door is always open for them.' But he added: 'Quick access to communication data can be a matter of life or death if, for example, you're trying to trace a child carrying a mobile phone.' Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to push through a new law stripping police of the power to secretly spy on journalists' phones .","Every police force HQ has access to Vodafone, Three and EE mainframes .

"A fast-trotting week of a drama, colour and fashion  has crossed the Spring Racing Carnival finish line. The last race has finished and the final, drunken souls have headed home on the train amid singsong and high spirits. Many will have left their heels behind and lost their wages on bad bets, but what memories they have made. More than 100,000 punters flocked through the gates and thousands more around the country enjoyed countless lunches, parties and glamorous functions to get in to the spirit of Australia's biggest horse race. As the day went on, so did the shenanigans, leaving some punters a little worse for wear. Setting a dramatic tone, dumped bachelorette Sam Frost arrived at Derby Day ready for some track-side fun, only to run into ex-fiance Blake Garvey in the same marquee. The Melbourne woman, who was dumped by the Bachelor Australia star weeks after he proposed on the show, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘I wasn’t expecting to see him, I was shocked.' She's since escaped overseas on a girlie holiday to try and mend her very broken heart. Spring Racing Carnival may just be the only event on the globe where glamour and the grotesque crossover. Apart from the devastatingly tragic deaths of the two Cup horses, Australians would not want the Carnival any other way. Here are the top 10 Melbourne Cup Week Carnival moments: . 1. Setting a dramatic tone, dumped bachelorette Sam Frost arrived at Derby Day ready for some track-side fun, only to run into ex-fiance Blake Garvey in the same marquee. Awkward! The Melbourne woman, who was dumped by the Bachelor Australia star weeks after he proposed on the show, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘I wasn’t expecting to see him, I was shocked.' She's since escaped overseas on a girlie holiday to try and mend her very broken heart . 2. Who will ever forget Geoffrey Edelsten, clad in a hideous canary yellow shiny silk suit, proposing to his mysteriously odd American girlfriend Gaby Greco infront of the cameras?How very apt that sequinned- adorned Gaby was dressed like a confused bird as she strutted through the Birdcage with huge, feathered horns.'Set the bird free!' laughed the stunned celebs looking down from the plush marquees concerned for her welfare on the arm of pensioner Geoffrey. 3. Rolling up on Crown Oaks Day, Brynne Edelsten, the blonde bombshell spurned ex of Geoffrey, sashayed into the luxury Emirates marquee declaring she didn't give a hoot about Geoffrey's forthcoming nuptials to Gaby. 'I'm in love!' she screeched. Her lover? A lofty body builder called Big Red Ra. He was busy at home drinking a protein shake or something . 4. Suddenly, everyone downing gallons of vintage Mumm in the Birdcage were reminded that somewhere nearby a pretty famous horse race had taken place - the Melbourne Cup. Word got round that, tragically, the Cup favourite Admire Ratki had collapsed and died from a heart attack after returning to his stable . This news was shortly followed by another top runner Araldo fatally injuring his leg after being spooked by a child waving a flag -spirits were dampened, and for good reason . 5. The tragic demise of the two top Cup horses didn't stop Carnival-goers from seeking attention.Model Imogen Anthony, girlfriend of radio DJ and TV star Kyle Sandilands, declared charmingly she didn't 'give a ***t' in the Mumm marquee that her Halloween-inspired leather bra top and bare midriff was against Flemington rules . 6. Battling high-winds, the entire cast of the Real Housewives of Melbourne attempted and failed to cover their fake-tanned assets while walking through the Birdcage lane ways. 7. While her famous German footballer boyfriend Mario Gotze was celebrating scoring one of the two goals that cemented Bayern Munich’s win against Roma, Ann-Kathrin Brommel couldn't stop smiling in Emirates Marquee as she enjoyed a day out in the Oaks Day sunshine.And despite the distance between the loved-up couple, Mario was certainly never far from the beauty’s mind deck exclusively telling Daily Mail Australia she'd just love for Mario to propose. Ann-Kathrin was a perfect rose amid some rather unpleasant thorns . Sprawled out, heels missing and dresses torn, teams of security staff had to help them leave Flemington. Their dignity, meanwhile, was left behind . 9. Yet amid the crass there was, thankfully, some class. Hollywood superstar Margot Robbie came home to Australia just in time to lift the tone of the Birdcage on Emirates Stakes Day wearing Ellery and a suspicious smile, as she mingled with her former Neighbours co-stars in Swisse marquee . 10. Let's not forget the most truly impressive moment of the week was a world-class performance from Protectionist, the Melbourne Cup winner of the race that stops a nation, at just his 10th race start. He clocked the fastest winning time since Media puzzle in 2002 .","The Spring Racing Carnival has crossed this year's finish line .

"With an all-day breakfast by Heston ­Blumenthal, a free personal shopper and the world’s only John Lewis Duty Free shop (just along from Cath ­Kidston), it is, surely, the poshest airport ­terminal in the world. In fact, it’s so grand that it will be opened by the Sovereign herself and won’t even have a number. It will have a name — although whoever came up with this one should be sent to the Tower. As of June, when this £2.5 billion ­monster is opened, Heathrow’s new ­Terminal 2 will be officially renamed The Queen’s ­Terminal — which sounds like a statement of ­republican intent or a very bleak ­medical prognosis. The re-opening of Terminal Two at Heathrow Airport next month will see it be renamed as The Queen's Terminal . I certainly wouldn’t advise mentioning ‘the Queen’s terminal’ anywhere near the Duke of Edinburgh. Back will come the retort: ‘No, she jolly well isn’t.’ Certainly, as terminals go, it’s very shiny and very smart. But for all the wavy roof design and Britain’s biggest indoor ­sculpture, not to mention a lot of PR nonsense about ‘Revolutionising The Check-In Experience’, it’s not much of a change. You’ll still end up in the same old queues to have your nail clippers confiscated by the same old jobsworths before walking half a mile to line up all over again at the gate. This week’s chaotic scenes at several British airports — fisticuffs and four-hour queues at Passport Control — are a timely reminder that when the computers go down, the colour scheme couldn’t matter less. If you’ve lost your luggage, you’re unlikely to be impressed that the desk attendants have been rebranded as ­‘Passenger Service Ambassadors’ (they really have). I doubt this place will ever see quite such a good-natured band of punters as the 3,000 passengers I join for the first big rehearsal this week. After that famously inept opening of Heathrow’s Terminal 5 in 2008, the airport management are taking no chances this time around. The new terminal will include a Heston Blumenthal Cafe and the first duty free John Lewis . The builders actually finished ­construction work last November in order to leave a clear six months for fine-tuning everything. This week’s epic play-acting exercise is the first attempt at an ordinary day. With up to 20 million passengers on 23 ­airlines (including United, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus) expected through this building every year, there could be 3,000 people ­coming through here each hour. That is ­double the number using the old Terminal 2 before it was knocked down in 2009 (since when its tenant airlines have been lodging in other terminals). There was, interestingly, no problem rounding up this number of volunteers, in exchange for a packed lunch and a sneak preview. Local newspaper ads have helped to recruit 14,000 volunteers — more than at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony — for the entire test programme. ‘It’s a nice day out, and I remember ­Heathrow in the days when passengers waited inside tents,’ says retired airport worker Pepina Powell, from Oxfordshire. She and her husband Les, a retired RAF navigator, are here to board an imaginary flight to Bern. The new sculpture within the terminal is called the 'Slipstream'. It was designed by British artist Richard Wilson . ‘Best of all,’ beams Pepina, ‘they’ve knocked 30 years off my age!’ Every single volunteer has been handed an individual script on arrival, complete with name, age, nationality, boarding pass and replica passport. Some are allocated an oversize cabin bag to test the reactions of staff at the gate. Others are told to dawdle in Duty Free and hold up everyone else. Retired book distributor Neil Hayman is rather sorry not to be his new alter ego. He is playing a ­youthful American called Kris Sun with a United Airlines ticket to Miami. Roy and Janet Haines, from Reading, ­Berkshire, are less thrilled. Not only have they been recast as a male couple from South Africa, but Roy has been given a First Class seat to ­Singapore while Janet has been plonked in Economy. The first thing we all encounter on turning up is a 256-ft, 77-ton ­aluminium-plated creation called Slipstream, which hangs over the covered walkway at the front of the terminal. Designed by the artist Richard Wilson, it replicates the exact path of a stunt plane swooping through the terminal. The 'Slipstream' artwork is suspended 18 meters above the ground, weighs 77 tonnes and is 78 meters in length . The £2.5 million result might best be described as a cross between a drill bit and a piece of pasta, but it is a clever concept, well-executed. Many people stop to take its photograph. ‘We wanted something which reflects Britain as a world centre of the arts and of engineering,’ explains Heathrow’s development director, John Holland-Kaye. A Cambridge-educated classicist, he explains that the new terminal is part of a 40-year plan to transform Heathrow from a hotch-potch of five ill-fitting terminals to a sleeker airport with two mega-­terminals — this one and Terminal 5. Each has a main building linked to a colossal satellite annexe by ­tunnel. On its own, the new ‘royal’ terminal is already bigger than Stansted Airport. If Heathrow’s Spanish owners, Ferrovial, get permission for the third runway which they ­desperately want — and which half of London does not — then these two giants will have to grow even bigger. The much-trumpeted ‘revolutionary’ check-in is about as radical as Antiques ­Roadshow but the security hall is unusually big and bright. One ­volunteer, who works at the airport, tells me that she is dismayed by the lack of privacy. ‘I have been asked to take off ­several layers of clothing with a queue of men right behind me, and there are no cubicles,’ she says. ‘People from some Middle Eastern countries will be appalled.’ A construction worker puts the finishing touches to the new terminal which is due to open on June 23 . Once inside, there are some exotic additions to the usual spread of cheap fags, booze and scent. ­Heston Blumenthal’s Perfectionists’ Café will feature liquid nitrogen ice cream and staff will be trained to grind all the burgers along the grain of the meat for optimum juiciness.

"Have you ever ditched your shopping basket in Primark because you can't face the queue for the changing rooms? Or maybe you've avoided picking up some post-jog supermarket essentials because you can't face heading round the store in sweaty clothing. Well help is now on the way, thanks to the invention of a new maxi dress that means you can get changed while in a busy public place, without anyone catching a glimpse of what lies underneath. Scroll down for video . The 'Undress' maxi dress was designed by two Californians for women on-the-go. It means ladies can switch outfits in public without flashing any skin . The creation, called the Undress, looks like a long dress with a halter top and long skirt, but comes packed with extras including pockets, drawstrings and the ability to shorten the skirt and reverse the design. The design means the days of changing behind a precariously-placed beach towel or in the backseat of a car are over. The Undress is the brainchild of entrepreneurs Dennis Caco and April Estrada, who organise sports events for charity in their home city of San Diego. The Undress is expected to cost $75 (£45) when it goes on sale later this year. Mrs Estrada said: 'I love the fact that The Undress gives women like me the freedom to change anywhere they want to. 'When I took up running for the first time last year, I was shocked by how difficult and uncomfortable it was to change out of my clothes, especially my sports bra, immediately after a run.' The Undress is designed for busy women who often need to get changed out of outfits while heading from one activity to another . She continued: 'It's hard for women to find a discrete place to change out in public but it's awesome that it'll no longer be a problem with The Undress. 'For runners, swimmers, surfers, cross-trainers, mums, travellers and other women with several places to be in one day, it often leaves little time and means to change outfits. 'As an innovative apparel invention, The Undress is designed with two side access openings, a slip-under front panel, drawstring, front inner lining, and other special features that make the transition of changing without being exposed possible. 'The Undress makes living an active lifestyle more convenient than ever.' The 'Undress' comes in a range of colours and will go on sale later this year priced at $75 (£45) Mr Caco added: 'Working in active sports myself, I've seen that one of the hardest things for women about working out isn't the workout itself - it's changing out of their sweaty clothes afterwards. 'Even as a guy I see and feel the discomfort that women have to go through when they try to sneak in their cars to change or try to inconspicuously change under a towel. 'But now, women no longer have to take the risk of bearing it all. 'There's a solution for them and it's called The Undress.'","'Undress' maxi dress was designed by two Californians for women on-the-go .

"Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has recovered from his summer ordeals to the extent there is now considerable support among top-flight teams for him to be promoted to executive chairman. The clubs’ meeting on Thursday appointed headhunters Spencer Stuart to help find a successor to city financier Anthony Fry, who is too ill to continue in the role after suffering a stroke. But the talk before the summit was that as many as 10 clubs, including some of the bigger ones, might back Scudamore’s role being upgraded. And 10 is not far short of the 14-club majority needed for PL changes. Premier League chief Richard Scudamore in the stands at Anfield for Liverpool's game against Chelsea . It represents a surprisingly rapid return for Scudamore to his old ‘ringmaster’ influence. The 55-year-old nearly lost his job in the furore that followed his sexist text exchanges with PL lawyer Nick West. Then in June he had heart surgery, from which he has made a full recovery. The part-time job England 2018 found for an acquaintance of FIFA rogue Jack Warner during the bidding process, which ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert claims undermined the integrity of the bidding process, turned out to be a work experience position. There is no record the FA even paid the young man for his eight-week stint. Beleaguered Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said before the Premier League clubs meeting that the troubles at Spurs would easily be remedied by a ‘few wins’. Meanwhile, although English grandees such as Arsenal chairman Sir Chips Keswick and West Ham’s Baroness Brady attend clubs meetings, not one foreign club owner was at Thursday’s London summit. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said that trouble at Spurs would be remedied by 'a few wins' Alex Horne, the departing FA general secretary, enjoyed an annual salary and bonuses of £528,000, making him the highest paid boss of a sports governing body in the UK. But FA chairman Greg Dyke has no intention of paying Horne’s successor that amount. And there is opposition among FA powerbrokers to any contract discussions with Roy Hodgson before Euro 2016. They feel, after the World Cup debacle, the manager should be judged on how England perform in France rather than on the easiest of qualifying tasks. Qatar’s Africa stitch-up . Hans-Joachim Eckert's report somehow regards England spending £35,000 on the 2010 Caribbean Football Union gala dinner at Jack Warner’s behest as being a bigger breach of FIFA regulations than Qatar forking out £1.15m to endorse the African Confederation (CAF) congress in Angola in 2010. And this despite England 2018 having clearance from FIFA to do so, while nothing was known about Qatar’s huge sponsorship until after the deal was done. There is no mention that Qatar barred England from presenting to CAF delegates because they had bought exclusive rights to the event. The Angola summit was also the occasion on which Mohamed bin Hammam made it clear he was helping the Qatari bid, although Eckert claims the cash-for-votes scandal which led to his lifetime ban from football was only to do with his aborted bid for the FIFA presidency. ............................................................................ The world stops for Premier League business, even with FIFA in meltdown. It needed your ever helpful Sports Agenda columnist to inform FA chairman Greg Dyke — when he emerged after three hours stuck in a clubs summit on Thursday — about Michael Garcia’s castigation of his FIFA ethics colleague Hans-Joachim Eckert. Michael Garcia (left) and Hans-Joachim Eckert shake hands outside FIFA HQ in 2012 . Sir Alex Ferguson was asked at one of his autobiography book events why Sam Allardyce didn’t get a mention and Fergie intimated that Sam wouldn’t be pleased. However, on page one of the updated paperback edition, Fergie writes: ‘Sam Allardyce has become a great pal.’ Jack Warner's most ridiculous demands to the England 2018 team were not included in Hans-Joachim Eckert’s flawed report, in which he gave the strong impression England kowtowed to Warner at every opportunity. Certainly they rejected Warner’s request that they pay $1m for Hurricane-torn Haiti’s World Cup TV rights, which was to be paid into the Caribbean Football Union account. England were criticised for trying to woo former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner .","Support grows for Scudamore to be promoted to executive chairman .

"There aren't many bigger fans of Joe Hart than me. I think he's the best goalkeeper England has produced since David Seaman, and I love his passion for winning. But that passion was no excuse for him to launch his head into referee Michael Oliver's face during the Manchester derby on Sunday. The referee had dealt with the incident Hart was upset about, and the goalkeeper's rhino-like charge and butt at the referee was as bizarre as it was unnecessary. Joe Hart approaches Michael Oliver near the halfway line after being incensed by Chris Smalling's block . The England goalkeeper leans his head towards the official, who tells him to return to his goal . Some might say the FA need to act on this, but I think there is a bigger concern. Oliver is a Premier League referee so he's considered to be one of the best we've got. So why did he not send Hart off? Think about it: a player charges at a referee and sticks his head in their face. That is a red card, and there is surely no room for debate on that. So why did Oliver bottle that decision? It's happening more and more. Big decisions are being dodged by referees who hope the FA will take responsibility the following Monday and charge the player they should have sent off. This incident is disappointing for two reasons. Firstly, I actually rate Oliver as a referee. Hart certainly appears to make contact with the referee, but Oliver appeared unperturbed . Secondly, he has done his colleagues who launch themselves into the firing line - into the heat of battle, into the ugly midst of 22 foul-mouthed, over-aggressive, testosterone-fuelled egomaniacs every week - a disservice. Oliver's inexplicable refusal to show a straight red to Hart for such an act of aggression towards a match official sent the message to all players that if they fancy dominating and bullying a referee, they're likely to get away with it, because Hart did. This was a great opportunity for Oliver to make a stand and demand respect for referees. He got this one spectacularly wrong. I do accept some officials make mistakes. Just lately though, I'm left asking the question: 'What is the ref actually watching?' The Antolin Alcaraz handball at Goodison Park and the Michael Carrick/Marouane Fellaini foul on Sergio Aguero this weekend are poignant examples. But this incident was shocking. Hart was in the wrong, that's not up for debate. But so too was Oliver. An act of aggression towards a match official is always a red card. We can only hope the ridiculous leniency of this ref doesn't start a nasty trend. Hart had been angry after Smalling attempted to block his clearance, for which the defender was booked .","Joe Hart was involved in a furious confrontation with Michael Oliver .

"The Van Gaal/Mourinho love-in made me sick . Balotelli should take a look at Sanchez . In 25 years covering football at all levels, from way down the pyramid to the World Cup final, I don’t think I have ever come across a footballer more determined and passionate about playing for England than Saido Berahino - and he’s got special reason as well. Berahino’s back story is well-known, but let me briefly fill you in. Born in Burundi, his mother fled the war-torn country after his father had died. She made her way to England, 10-year-old Saido arrived here alone some time after. There was a lot of red-tape, but mother and son were eventually allowed to live in the same home in Birmingham, and young Berahino started playing football and learning English. Young West Brom striker Saido Berahino is determined and passionate about playing for the England team . Berahino keeps his cool to score a vital equaliser from the penalty spot against Crystal Palace on Saturday . The 21-year-old Baggies frontman is the current leading English goalscorer in the Barclays Premier League . Berahino arrived in England at the age of 10 after his mother fled war-torn Burundi following his father's death . He says that this is when his life finally started. What England did for Berahino and his family is constantly running through his heart and head. Forget the fact he wasn’t born in England – he oozes more passion for this country than he could if he was born in Buckingham Palace with a plate of fish and chips in one hand, a Union Jack in the other, and whistling the theme tune to Coronation Street. This is what he said when I asked him what playing for England would mean to him: 'It would mean the world to me as England have given me a second chance to have a better life for me and my family.' Berahino, pictured celebrating  for the Under 21s, admits it would be a dream come true to play for England . West Brom career . Premier League appearances: 41 . Premier League goals: 12 . West Brom (2014/15) Premier League appearances: 9 . Premier League goals: 7 . England Under 21s . Appearances: 13 . Goals: 10 . I’m not one of those who think most England players aren’t passionate about representing their country. I’ve always thought that is a lazy accusation. Some people study whether the players sing the national anthem – I’m not interested in that stuff to be honest, despite the fact I’m a true England fan. I care about how they play, but more importantly I care about their willingness to play. At every level from England Under 16 upwards, Berahino has always willingly turned up, when so many others cried off. Even when heavily tipped to move up to the senior squad, Berahino accepted that he was staying in the Under 21s and went out and performed to the best of his ability. I doubt you care much about England if you’ve read this and not felt keen to see the West Brom striker wear the Three Lions on his shirt. You want passion with England? You want someone who cares about this country? You want someone who feels they owe it to this country to give his very, very best and more? Then let’s get Berahino into the England squad as soon as possible please. I haven’t even mentioned how good a footballer he is – the goals speak for themselves. At every level, from England Under 16 upwards, Berahino has always willingly turned up to play . Berahino gets the better of Man United defender Rafael to score against the Red Devils earlier this season . But I watched him carefully against Crystal Palace on Saturday and it’s fair to say he didn’t have his best game, but he still contributed two key moments. West Brom were trailing 2-0 at The Hawthorns when Berahino started a move on the left. He picked up the ball on the edge of the area and curled a terrific shot towards the far corner, only to see it superbly tipped behind by Julian Speroni. This was five minutes into the second half, and it got the Baggies going, it woke them up and West Brom scored from the subsequent corner. Berahino also kept his cool to score the penalty deep into added time that gave West Brom a point. With West Brom trailing against Palace, Berahino brought the Baggies to life as they fought back to draw 2-2 . Berahino places the ball past a stretching Wayne Hennessey to claim a point for the Baggies on Saturday . There are strikers getting in the England squad who don’t even play, let alone score. At West Bromwich Albion you have a committed and very good young striker in the form of his life who is passionate about playing for England. It’s a no-brainer. Do the decent thing, Roy.","Saido Berahino moved to England at the age of 10 after his mother fled from war-torn Burundi .

"Danny Cipriani has no intention of giving up. He won’t abandon all hope. Playing for England at the World Cup remains the objective, despite recent disappointment. The Sale fly-half has responded to being omitted from the national squad for the autumn Test campaign in fine style. Rather than allowing the setback to undermine his form, he has instead played an instrumental role in three successive Aviva Premiership wins which have lifted his club to sixth place in the table. Sale Sharks fly-half Danny Cipriani is determined to go to next year's Rugby World Cup . Cipriani (centre) was dropped from England's squad for the Autumn International Tests . On Sunday, it was Cipriani’s moment of individual brilliance which created a stunning counter-attack try for the Sharks against Newcastle at Kingston Park. It was another glimpse of his game-breaking class. After making an impressive contribution on England’s summer tour of New Zealand, the 27-year-old was left out of the latest squad. But Cipriani said: ‘All I can do is control how I train every day, keep trying to improve and keep working on my point of difference.’ As he prepared for Sale’s European Champions Cup clash with Saracens at the AJ Bell Stadium on Saturday, he added: ‘Even if I don’t get selected, it is a long way to go until the World Cup and I’ll keep driving and keep knocking on the door. ‘I’m going to keep pushing every time I play; with passion and drive and resilience and the will to win. Eventually, I want to play for my country again. ‘Things do happen, things can change and you can play your way into the squad. The England coaches are very good at communicating; they speak to you, tell you what they want and what you have to improve on. It makes you feel like you’re part of the wider squad.’ Cipriani has been in inspirational for his club - taking Sale on a three game winning run . The 27-year-old impressed for England during the summer tour of New Zealand . That match-winning turn at Newcastle was just the latest example of his enhanced contribution at club level. ‘I feel like I’m playing better this year,’ he said. ‘I’m going to keep putting my hand up.’ Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond has regularly championed his playmaker’s Test claims and yesterday said: ‘Danny’s playing really well, he’s controlling the basics and he’s showing on occasion the bit of glitter that he has. ‘There was a great example at Newcastle where two teams were in stalemate with a couple of points in it and his act of brilliance won us the game. ‘It would be foolhardy to think that, if Danny had been selected, England would have beaten South Africa and New Zealand, but I think it would have been wise as a selector to look at him in one of the four games. ‘Danny was outstanding before the squad was announced, against Munster, and didn’t get a look-in.’ The Sale No 10 is preparing to take on Saracens in  the European Champions Cup clash on Saturday . Saracens star Owen Farrell stands ahead of Cipriani in the England pecking order . On Saturday, Cipriani is likely to be in direct opposition to Owen Farrell, who has been England’s first-choice No 10 under Stuart Lancaster, only to be demoted last month after a run of poor form. ‘You want to play against the best 10s,’ said Cipriani. ‘In England, you come up against Farrell, Ford, Myler week in, week out. If you get a chance in a European fixture it does add spice to it and you want to have a great game. It’s important that we rise to the occasion as a team.’ Diamond is convinced that if his forwards can front up against an imposing Saracens pack, Cipriani has the ability to trump his opposite number — whether that is Farrell or ex-Shark Charlie Hodgson. ‘If we can get parity then I think Danny can surpass the pair of them,’ he said. ‘Hodgson can do with his hands what Danny can do. He is a great distributor and that would be a great contest. But they will probably start with Farrell and he is a machine. He might not be the flashiest, but England haven’t gone too far wrong with him in the team and Saracens have built a team around him.’","Danny Cipriani was left out of England's Autumn Internationals squad .

"Those anticipating the Premier League return got just what they wanted - last-minute winners, red cards, the odd mistake and, of course, stand-out performances. A new season is upon us, and what better way to impress than to top the statistical table? Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10  Premier League performers from the weekend. Raheem Sterling, Aaron Ramsey and David Silva all make the list, but who comes out on top in our Player Performance Index PPI chart? 10. Sebastian Larsson, Sunderland (PPI score: 33.6) Last year, Sunderland finished five points above the relegation zone. Every point counts in the harsh climate of the Premier League and Larsson, boasting an 83.3 per cent pass completion rate, spared the Black Cats' opening-day blushes with an 85th-minute goal to earn a draw against West Brom. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Aaron Ramsey get his ears flicked during training . No 10: Sunderland's Sebastian Larsson earned a point for the Black Cats on the opening day at West Brom .

The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning Performance . 2. Player's Performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . 9. Tom Ince, Hull City (34.4) Hull welcomed Queens Park Rangers back to the Premier League by stripping them of any points at Loftus Road, and Ince was as big a part of that away win as anyone. The 22-year-old left the capital having kept a 95.8 per cent pass completion rate throughout, and showed Inter Milan what they missed out on. 8. Eric Dier, Tottenham Hotspur (35.7) Scoring a last-minute winner in a London derby on your debut in the first game of the Premier League season says it all. On Saturday, a 20-year-old by the name of Eric Dier did just that. The former Sporting centre-back emerged from Upton Park with an 88.4 per cent pass completion rate, too. No 9: Hull City's Tom Ince made QPR taste defeat on the opening day with a 95.8 per cent pass completion rate . No 8: Tottenham Hotspur's Eric Dier scored a last-minute winner in the London derby against West Ham . 7. Laurent Koscielny, Arsenal (37.5) The only team to win at home on Saturday, Arsenal can thank Koscielny for making that happen against a manager-less Crystal Palace in the aftermath of losing Tony Pulis. With the equalising goal, six clearances and four interceptions, the 28-year-old centre-back was a rock in the heart of the defence, and earned his three points at the Emirates. No 7: Arsenal's Laurent Koscielny used his head to help them be the only team to win at home on Saturday . Well done: Koscielny got the equaliser, made six clearances and four interceptions against Crystal Palace . Earned: Arsenal started the Premier League season with three points at the Emirates over Palace . 6. Aaron Ramsey, Arsenal (39.8) The clock struck 90 but Ramsey didn't care. The 23-year-old was in the right place at the right time to earn Arsenal three points in the dying moments, just as a broken Palace side thought they'd earned a share of the spoils in north London. The Wales international added 65 passes in the opposition half, completed 92 overall, and boasted an 86.8 per cent completion rate for good measure.

Earned: The Wales star added 65 passes in the opposition half and completed 92 overall at the Emirates . VIDEO Wenger lauds late Ramsey goal . 5. David Silva, Manchester City (39.9) It all went according to plan for City. No slip ups, no surprises. Silva, as per usual, was among those making life uncomfortable for Newcastle, scoring once and making 51 passes in the opposition half with a tidy 88.2 per cent pass completion rate. It was as if the 28-year-old had never been away. No 5: David Silva of Manchester City ensured Newcastle United did not cause an upset at St James' Park . Surrounded: Silva scores the opening goal on Sunday as City ran out 2-0 winners in the Premier League . Up there: Silva made life uncomfortable, making 51 passes in the opposition half with a tidy 88.2 per cent rate . 4. James Chester, Hull City (42.8) Chester, showing the strength needed in the Premier League, shrugged off Rio Ferdinand, QPR's export from Manchester United, and nabbed the goal that won the game. The centre-back didn't forget his duties at the back either, making 14 clearances and three blocks. No 4: James Chester helped Hull City beat QPR at Loftus Road and was equally solid in defence as well . 3. Gylfi Sigurdsson, Swansea City (47.5) Swansea failed to read the script when they beat Manchester United 2-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday - not that they cared. It was Sigurdsson who ultimately spoiled the Louis van Gaal party, restoring the Welsh club's advantage with less than 20 minutes remaining. An all-round performance saw the 24-year-old score, provide the assist for Sung-Yueng Ki's opener, and keep a pass completion rate of 76.2 per cent. No 3: Gylfi Sigurdsson spoiled Louis van Gaal's party at Old Trafford on Saturday to earn Swansea a 2-1 win . Winner: Sigurdsson provided the assist for Sung-Yueng Ki's opener and kept a pass completion rate of 76.2 . 2. Saido Berahino, West Brom (50.4) West Brom's top goalscorer of last season got off the mark somewhat emphatically. Two goals, five crosses delivered and an 82.1 per cent pass completion rate warranted more than the point he got in return against Sunderland. That's one way to tell manager Alan Irvine to put his name on the team-sheet first ahead of new £10million signing Brown Ideye.

A goal, an assist, an 81.8 pass completion rate and five successful dribbles compiled the misery on Southampton, who fell to a 2-1 defeat on their return without Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren and Luke Shaw.

"So this week's big thing is to add up how much Brendan Rodgers has spent at Liverpool and conclude that he's useless. I'm all for scrutinising players, managers and others in the game – that's what I do. But it's always good to retain a bit of perspective when throwing that spotlight on some of the people involved at the sharp end. VIDEO Scroll down for: Liverpool can still progress - Rodgers . Brendan Rodgers has found it tough going as he tries to emulate Liverpool's success from last year . Jordan Henderson, Mario Balotelli and Steven Gerrard reflect during Liverpool's 1-0 loss at Newcastle United . Liverpool's task doesn't get any easier - they play Real Madrid in the Bernabeu on Tuesday night . I'm amazed how quickly some people have forgotten how brilliantly Rodgers did with Liverpool last season. They were a joy to watch, in fact his Liverpool team last season were the pioneers of the new attacking style adopted by the Premier League. Of course Luis Suarez was a huge part of that – but the way Rodgers oversaw the development of Jordan Henderson, Jon Flanagan and Raheem Sterling cannot be ignored. All three played a massive part in that fantastic football we all enjoyed last season. Rodgers also did something that no other manager had done before – he trusted Daniel Sturridge. The striker repaid that faith, and both Liverpool and England benefited. Captain Gerrard, Martin Skrtel and Balotelli look dejected after the loss at St James' Park . The loss of Luis Suarez, who scored 31 goals last season, to Barcelona has hit Liverpool hard . Liverpool desperately need Daniel Sturridge back from injury and firing again . Liverpool find themselves in seventh in the Premier League table after an indifferent start to the season . There were so many examples of good management from Rodgers last season, and they shouldn't be so easily forgotten. To take a team from seventh position to second is some achievement. The fact that a slip at the end cost Liverpool the title had the effect of making too many people judge the season as a failure. Far from it. Rodgers' management was magnificent last season and this campaign is proving trickier. Four defeats in 10 Premier League games and a stuttering Champions League effort isn't good, and I'll be massively impressed if Rodgers can get a consistent run of performances from Mario Balotelli. And it would be no surprise if Liverpool are well beaten by Real Madrid on Tuesday night. Balotelli has scored just twice for Liverpool since arriving from AC Milan at the end of the transfer window . Liverpool come up again Cristiano Ronaldo and the might of Real Madrid in the Champions League next . For the side that finished seventh in the Premier League two years ago to even be on the same pitch as the European champions is some achievement, and the Liverpool manager deserves huge credit. He's got enough in the bank to be above the kind of scrutiny he's being subjected to right now. The start of the season hasn't been what Liverpool expected and wanted – you don't need to have played the game to work that one out. But after what he did last season - and just 10 games into this - I think we should still be focusing more on Rodgers' achievements, rather than what has gone wrong this season.

"Beekeeper Steven Anderson, who knew he was allergic to bees, died after receiving a single sting . A beekeeper who knew he was allergic to bees was killed by a single sting despite pleas from his father to give up his hobby. Steven Adderson, 39, had promised to 'be careful' when his worried father Graham begged him to forget about his hobby. But the popular engineer from Downham Market in Norfolk, who was six foot nine, received a deadly sting after he forgot to put on special protective boots when he went to check out a 'rogue swarm' at a neighbour's house. Now his father Graham has spoken out to warn of the extreme dangers of anaphylactic shock, which thousands of people are at risk of suffering when stung. Mr Adderson, who owns a fish and chip shop in the town, said he repeatedly urged his son to give up his two-year hobby and his beloved bees. The father-of-three said: 'When we found out that he was allergic to bees I said to him ""I shouldn’t bother with those bees - it could kill you"".' said the father-of-three. 'But he said ""I will be all right, I will be careful"".' Mr Adderson explained that on the morning of his son's death, the 39-year-old was on his way to work when he went to investigate the angry bees at a neighbour’s house. He explained: 'He put his suit on but I think he was in a rush to get to work and forgot to put the boots on and got stung on the ankle as a result. 'He could not find the queen bee.' Steven, who always carried an EpiPen adrenaline shot with him, managed to stagger back home and call 999. He told the operator he was feeling faint and light-headed but seconds later he collapsed. 'When the ambulance arrived they emptied every bit of adrenaline they had into Steven and rushed him to hospital but they couldn't do anything for him,' added Mr Adderson. The freak tragedy stunned the town and hundreds of family, friends and local people packed St Edmund Church in Downham for Steven’s funeral service on June 30. Steven, whose death left his fiancée Emma and brothers Philip and Daniel devastated, was also a big fan of Land Rovers. Mr Adderson will now be taking part in a charity motor show in Snetterton, Norfolk, next month with his beloved MG XPower SV and will be selling passenger rides. Scroll down for video . His father Graham, pictured, had urged his son to give up his hobby after learning he was allergic to bees. He is now speaking out about the dangers of anaphylactic shock . He warned: 'I would just urge people with all my heart to be very careful with bees - if one lands on you, don’t whack it off, just blow it away.' An Office of National Statistics spokesman said only one person was killed by a bee sting in the UK in 2012 and none last year. Gill Maclean, of the British Beekeepers Association, said Steven’s death was 'an extremely tragic and extremely rare' case. Ms Maclean said: 'If you know you are allergic then the sensible thing to do is to give beekeeping up or not start it. 'The most important thing we would say is to get the training and education. 'But bees don’t set out to sting people as they die straight away afterwards - they are far more interested in finding a flower.'","Beekeeper Steven Adderson, 39, knew that he was allergic to bees .

"Greig Laidlaw sent a strong message to coach Vern Cotter that he is the man to inspire Scotland with arguably his best performance in an international jersey. However, the diminutive Borderer insisted that his inspiration for steering his side to a thrilling 41-31 win over Argentina at BT Murrayfield had come from the new head coach. ‘I just think it was great for this group of players to have someone like Vern coming in from a team like Clermont, who were pushing the standards in Europe,’ he said. Stand-off Greig Laidlaw inspired Scotland to a thrilling 41-31 win over Argentina . ‘He just really gives us confidence to go and try things. He understands that mistakes happen, that nobody wants to make mistakes, and I made a mistake for the first play of the game. It wasn’t a great pass but I maybe should have just held it and then we were seven points down. ‘But I just thought “park that, mistakes are made and we have a game-plan to go out and play” and, on the whole, we executed that. ‘Vern gives you confidence to do that, I think. He gives you confidence in training to try different things, to express yourself and try to beat players one-on-one, and doesn’t bollock players unless it’s ridiculous — and I think that’s been the key change.’ Laidlaw had found himself switching from scrum-half to stand-off to cover Scottish weaknesses in recent years and, while he was delighted to answer Scotland’s call wherever needed, there is little doubt that it asked a lot of the relatively new international to flit between two different roles and the mental complexities that each position brings. Add on the responsibility for goal-kicking, while striving to lead a struggling Edinburgh side, and there is perhaps no surprise that his own form wavered at times. Scotland's Greig Laidlaw makes a break to set up a try for Stuart Hogg . He took the decision to leave Edinburgh this year and has found a new lease of life at Gloucester, where his quality of service has quickened, his speed over the ground has improved and his confidence is bubbling up again. The result is that, installed back in the No 9 jersey and asked to captain the side when first choice Grant Gilchrist was injured, Laidlaw stepped up to the plate last night and guided the team to one of the most convincing wins witnessed against a top-10 nation at Murrayfield. ‘I have got the spring back in my step,’ he said. ‘Going down to Gloucester, it’ s a very hard competition and you get to understand pretty quickly there that they are hard games week in, week out and you have to win games. So they are all pressure games and that has helped me. ‘But just going to a new club helped me where you want to prove yourself again, and so you have to work hard. But also coming back up here I knew that Chris Cusiter and Henry (Pyrgos) were also playing well and that was pushing me too for today’s performance. Stuart Hogg celebrates scoring a try with team-mates Finn Russell and Greig Laidlaw . ‘I enjoyed the game out there but, as Vern said, one to 15 the boys put their bodies on the line so we were all ‘man of the match’ in my eyes. ‘Scoring 41 points… I’ve not done that too many times in a Scotland jersey, and Scotland haven’t done that for a while. ‘But we will keep our feet on the ground because we gave away a couple of soft tries. There are always things to work on, especially with the best team in the world coming to play next week. We’ll need to turn up for that big style.’ Looking ahead to the visit of his native Kiwis, Cotter added that the final quarter where Scotland conceded 21 points would figure prominently in analysis as would the scrums that started to struggle late on. ‘We’ll be very honest about the end of the game and how we conceded penalties,’ he said. ‘We want to be consistent and resilient all over the park and I think sometimes we scrummaged very well and sometimes perhaps didn’t.’","Greig Laidlaw produced his best performance in a Scotland jersey .

"The formation that Louis van Gaal started with against Swansea — three central defenders and two wing backs — is a hard enough system for seasoned professionals to get right, let alone a group of youngsters, including a few making their debuts at Old Trafford. I’ve always felt it demands too much of the wing backs, who have to cover so much ground. If their positioning is not spot on, then the central defenders have to react and cover the danger, but this can result in your team shape being dragged from side to side. And that’s exactly what happened to United on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: Our confidence will be smashed . Shock? Ki (left) celebrates as Swansea go 1-0 up against Manchester United at Old Trafford . Mishaps: The build-up to Swansea's opener highlighted how United were dragged from side to side . There were 29 passes in the Swansea move for the first goal, but it should have been stopped sooner. Ashley Young, playing as a wing back, dropped to full back, which meant he was marking Nathan Dyer (1). Tyler Blackett should have moved across to act as the full back, leaving Young to deal with Swansea right back Angel Rangel. Instead, Darren Fletcher and Ander Herrera were forced to press Rangel (2). Blackett got too tight to Gylfi Sigurdsson but Chris Smalling and Phil Jones needed to move across to cover. They didn’t and they left Swansea acres of room to run into (3). Jubilation: Swansea players celebrate going ahead in the second-half in front of their travelling fans . Down: How United conceded their first goal against Swansea on Saturday at Old Trafford . By the time the ball reached Sigurdsson, the United midfield, who should have been protecting the defence, were nowhere to be seen. With the defenders also out of position, Ki Sung-yueng was left free to fire home from the edge of the area. Three points: Gylfi Sigurdsson wheels away in celebration after scoring the match-winner . Out of position: Manchester United were all over the place for Swansea's second goal on Saturday . Give Van Gaal credit: he saw there were problems and changed to four at the back at half-time. But they were still all over the place for the second goal. Blackett was naive in the extreme to give the ball away with his team-mates out of position. Montero sprang down the left and Smalling went to cover, with Jones moving inside. The United pair should be adept at switching positions but they made a mess of it. Smalling did not do enough to stop the cross (1) while Jones over-covered and got too close to him (2). He should be worrying about what’s coming into the box. When the cross beat Young at the back post (3), and was passed to Sigurdsson, he was free to score with Jones out of position.","Louis van Gaal started with three centre backs and two wing backs .

Binky who wears lingerie brand Bluebella exclusively throughout the shoot, says:'Bluebella looks sensational in the bedroom, but I wear it all the time - not just on date nights. 'It makes you feel great if you are out with someone special or slogging through a 14-hour shoot with Made In Chelsea.'

"A mistake from Barcelona keeper Claudio Bravo on his debut allowed Napoli’s Swiss midfielder Blerim Dzemaili to score the only goal in his team’s 1-0 win in Geneva. The Chile keeper had played well until he fumbled the long shot with 10 minutes left to give Rafa Benitez’s side victory over Luis Enrique’s young team. Barcelona are still missing all three of their first choice strikers and without Leo Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez they failed to turn some good football into goals and paid the price when Bravo conceded late on. Blunder: Blerim Dzemaili's shot squeezes through the hands of Claudio Bravo on Wednesday night . Horror show: The Chile goalkeeper can only watch the ball drop into the net in Geneva . Take that: Switzerland midfielder Dzemaili couldn't believe his luck after the goal . Disappointing: It has been anything but a perfect start at Barcelona for new boss Luis Enrique . Surrounded: Barcelona playmaker Andres Iniesta looks to escape the attention of Napoli players . In their second pre-season friendly under their new coach Barca lined-up with a strong defence and a first-choice midfield but were missing all three of their star strikers. Bravo started in goal behind Martin Montoya, Gerard Pique, Marc Bartra and Jordi Alba. And Ivan Rakitic took his place alongside Sergi Busquets and captain Andres Iniesta in midfield. But up front Pedro played alongside 18-year-old Munir El Haddadi and Rafinha Alcantara. It was Munir who had the best chance of the first half when played in by Rakitic. He drew the advancing Rafael Cabral but the Napoli keeper stuck out a left arm to deflect the youngster’s shot clear. Munir missed another one on one with Rafael but was at least finding space with some intelligent running as Barca tried to break down Napoli’s well organised defence. Making his mark: Ivan Rakitic started for the Catalan giants in Geneva . Crunch: Rafael Alcantara is caught on the knee by Kalidou Koulibaly - an awful tackle . At the other end Bravo showed good decision-making when he came out to smother the ball at Jose Callejon’s feet and he also tipped away a Marek Hamsik header from a Callejon cross midway through the first half. Barcelona had enjoyed most of the possession in the first half but were missing the finishing Messi, Suarez and Neymar will bring them. Messi is now back in full training while Neymar is still in the processing of recovering from the cracked vertebrae he suffered at the World Cup. Suarez is due to appeal against his four-month FIFA ban when he appears at the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday. Another former Premier League forward, Michu, came on for Napoli in the second half replacing the Colombian striker Duvan Zapata (who had worn the No 91 shirt in the first half). Pedro had the first chance of the second half shooting into the side netting from the edge of the area after Kalidou Koulibaly had headed clear. Good start: Claudio Bravo made a great save early on to on his first appearance for the club . Strong: Centre back Gerard Pique looked to hold off opposing forward Duvan Zapata . The Spain forward then very nearly finished Barcelona’s best move of the game. A 40-yard cross-field pass from Pique was nudged back to Pedro by Alba but again he shot into the side netting. Rafinha then shot from distance forcing another save from Rafael but still the breakthrough did not come and on the hour Enrique made six substitutions. Iniesta, Pedro, Munir, Rakitic, Alba and Pique were replaced by midfielders Sergi Samper and Sergi Roberto; 19-year-old forward Sandro Ramires; Croatia’s youngest ever debutant Alen Halilovic, 18-year-old full-back Grimaldo and 20-year-old Portuguese defender Edgar Le. Bartra took the armband from Pique but when he was also taken off it changed hands for a third time with Montoya now the oldest outfield Barca player on the pitch aged 23. In that second raft of changes former Everton loanee Gerard Deulofeu came on and after Bravo’s mistake and it was left to him to lead the charge for the equaliser but Rafael saved his shot after he cleverly room for himself in the area. Deulofeu then sent over a dangerous cross but Michu cleared as Napoli held on for the win.

"Liverpool return to Merseyside on Tuesday after a 16-day tour of America which saw them win three and lose two of their five matches on US soil. It ended on a low with defeat to bitter rivals Manchester United in the final of the International Champions Cup in Miami but there were plenty of positives along the way. Here is what Sportsmail learned... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Philippe Coutinho show off his silky skill sin friendly . Ending on a bad note: Liverpool lost to rivals Manchester United in Miami in the International Champions Cup . 1 Raheem Sterling truly is one of world football's most exciting young talents. The fearless teenage winger was Liverpool's outstanding performer on the tour. He scored against both Olympiacos and Manchester City, and tormented United during the opening 45 minutes before their second-half fightback. Sterling, equally at home out wide or in a central role, now possesses the tactical intelligence to go with his blistering pace. He scored 10 Premier League goals last season and looks capable of significantly improving that return to help Liverpool fill the void created by Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona. One to watch: Raheem Sterling continues to impress after coming of age in the Premier League last season . 2 Talking of special players, Liverpool boast another top class talent in Philippe Coutinho. The little Brazilian was devastated to miss out on the World Cup finals in his homeland but that hurt appears to be firing him on to greater heights. Coutinho's trickery and eye for a pass was a feature of the club's pre-season matches in the States. The only thing lacking has been a finishing touch. Rodgers has revealed that the little Brazilian will be rewarded for his impact with a lucrative new contract to ensure Liverpool fend off interest from clubs across Europe. Magic: Philippe Coutinho missed out on the World Cup but is making up for lost time with Liverpool . 3 Liverpool desperately need to sign another striker. Rodgers has been busy in the transfer market this summer with Atletico Madrid right-back Javier Manquillo set to be the club's seventh signing. However, they still look short of firepower. Daniel Sturridge (hamstring) and Fabio Borini (shoulder) both left the tour early due to injuries and that left Rickie Lambert as the club's only fit senior striker. Lambert is clearly still adjusting to life at Anfield and wasn't able to open his account – missing a penalty against Milan and fluffing a great chance against United. Sterling and Coutinho will chip in but Rodgers needs someone who can guarantee him 20 goals a season. VIDEO Sturridge no concern - Rodgers . Support: Daniel Sturridge is Liverpool's best striker but the club must replace Luis Suarez . 4 There is absolutely no chance of Pepe Reina resurrecting his Anfield career. The Spaniard joined Liverpool on the tour after spending last season on loan at Napoli. However, he trained away from the main group during most sessions and wasn't even named among the substitutes for any of the matches. With Simon Mignolet now the club's undisputed No 1, the writing is on the wall for Reina and Liverpool are desperate to get him off the wage bill. His £110,000 per week salary has put off rival clubs with Napoli unwilling to match that amount and pay the £4million transfer fee. It's a situation Liverpool need to resolve quickly. No future: Pepe Reina looks set to leave Anfield but his wages are proving a stumbling block for his suitors . 5 Rodgers' faith in youth is well documented and Liverpool boast another teenager who looks capable of lighting up the Premier League. Jordon Ibe is exactly a year younger than Sterling and is on course to follow in his footsteps. The 18-year-old has clearly benefited from a loan spell at Birmingham City last season and he was hugely impressive in the win against AC Milan in Charlotte. He's quick, strong and robust – as demonstrated by the manner in which the Italians' rough treatment failed to disrupt him. The question for Rodgers is whether to keep Ibe as an impact player this season or send him out on loan where his development would be aided by playing week in week out. Bright future: Jordan Ibe looks to be the next talented player to come off the Anfield conveyor belt .

"The New York townhouse featured prominently in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's has been placed on sale for $8million. The home, which is located at 169 East 71st Street in Manhattan's affluent Upper East Side neighborhood, is where Audrey Hepburn's character Holly Golightly lived and threw parties. Though the building was used only for the film's exterior shots (interior shots were done in a studio), its iconic stoop, front doors, and architectural accents are immediately recognizable. The only visible difference is the disappearance of green- and white-striped awnings over the windows. You there, Holly? The Manhattan home where Audrey Hepburn's character lived and entertained is on sale for $8million . Those olive green doors could be yours! Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) and Paul Valjak (George Peppard) 'Any time they had a street scene, the house was featured,' said Asher Alcobi of Peter Ashe Real Estate to Today.com. 'The signature olive green doors are still the same. 'The house is on the tourist tour of the Upper East Side.' The 3,800-square-foot, four-floor home has four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a greenhouse, and a garden duplex apartment with its own entrance. It was sold to its current owner in 2012 by Peter Bacanovic, the former Merrill Lynch broker who served five months in jail for aiding his client Martha Stewart in insider trading in 2004. Realtors recently dropped the price by 20per cent, but the $8million price tag is still a significant increase from the house's 2012 selling price: $5,850,000. Mr Bacanovic reportedly bought it for $1,880,000 in 2000. The brownstone, which was built in 1910, has undergone two major renovations since the film was made, once in the mid-80s and again in the late-90s. Still, the exterior remains largely untouched. Imagine the parties! The 3,800-square-foot home has its own greenhouse in the back . Have a seat! Though the film's interior shots where not filmed at the townhouse, the house's rooms do not look far off from what was used in the movie . Put on your eyelash-adorned eye-mask! For $8million dollars, you too can sleep like a queen . In Breakfast at Tiffany's, Holly Golightly, a young New York socialite,lived with her no-name cat at the residence. Her upstairs neighbor is Mr Yunioshi, a Japanese photographer, played by Mickey Rooney. Another neighbor is Paul Varjak, played by George Peppard, who eventually becomes her love interest. Ms Hepburn's role in the movie is generally regarded as the most significant of her career. Interestingly, the author of the novella the movie is based on, Truman Capote, wanted the role to be played by Marilyn Monroe. You could hail a cab from this very spot!

Interestingly, author Truman Capote wanted Marilyn Monroe for the role . Breakfast at Tiffany's was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay. It won Best Original Score and Best Original Song for Moon River. The film reportedly cost $2.5million to make, and grossed $4million at the box office (then considered a success) when it was released. Over its lifetime, it has made approximately $14million.","The home was previously owned by Peter Bacanovic, the former Merrill Lynch broker convicted of insider trading with Martha Stewart in 2004 .

"Wayne Rooney deserved to be sent off, irrespective of the Manchester United players' appeals for handball just prior to their captain's mindless act of aggression. West Ham’s Stewart Downing was breaking after a United attack, but he was still well inside his own half with plenty of opponents to beat, so any thought that this was a red card for the denial of an obvious goal scoring were well wide of the mark. Rooney’s act was a wild, violent kick at his opponent which deserves the three-match ban it carries. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney chops down West Ham's Stewart Downing from behind . The Man United No 10 (centre) was rightly shown a straight red card by referee Lee Mason after his kick . Rooney trudges off the field after his wild act of aggression that left his team hanging on for their 2-1 win . While both managers made claims of refereeing errors I could see nothing wrong with West Ham’s goal, other than a goalkeeping error by David De Gea. And at the other end, assistant referee Andy Garratt was absolutely correct to signal that Kevin Nolan was in an offside position before he ‘scored’ West Ham’s late equaliser. Referee Mason was correct in ruling out West Ham's equaliser from Kevin Nolan (centre) for offside . Replays clearly showed that Nolan's head was closer to the Man United goal line than the United defenders . Only showing Diafra Sakho (centre) a yellow card for tripping Rafael (second from right) was also correct .

"A coal train operator is missing after his train was derailed and pushed into a flowing water by a landslide in remote, mountainous Canada. Mining giant Rio Tinto confirmed the train was found in the waterway below the narrow mountain railroad and that company officials are urgently trying to find the missing driver. Authorities are also working to contain diesel that leaked spilled from the train into the water. Scroll down for video . An aerial view of the train which derailed while heading north of the town of Sept-Ales, in Quebec . It's believed a landslide caused the train to derail, sending it crashing into the water below . The train was carrying empty freight cars from the town of Sept-Ales, in Quebec, when it was derailed by a river feeding into the Gulf of St Lawrence. Derailments have become a particularly sensitive issue in Canada since a crude oil train crash in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, in July 2013 that killed 47 people. The company said all railway traffic was suspended until further notice. 'We will do our own investigation to determine the cause,' said Claudine Gagnon, a spokeswoman for Rio Tinto. 'Our priority is to find our employee.' A representative of Quebec's environment ministry confirmed diesel had leaked into the water, but could not say how much. He noted that the locomotive carried about 17,000 liters of diesel. 'We are now working to minimize the impact of the derailment on the river.' Iron Ore Company of Canada, majority-owned by Rio Tinto, owns and operates the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway, which links its mine to port facilities. The railway also carries iron ore from Cliffs Natural Resources' Bloom Lake mine. A Cliffs spokeswoman said it was too early to speculate about the impact of the derailment. Mrs Gagnon said the line mainly carries ore for Iron Ore Company of Canada and other clients. Trains also carry general freight, including fuel, material and equipment for mining companies and the communities of Wabush and Labrador City in Newfoundland and Labrador and Schefferville, Quebec. Mining giant Rio Tinto, which operates the line, said it was working to locate the train operator, who is still missing . The line is used twice a week for passenger service, with the next scheduled departure from Sept-ÃŽles on Monday. The July 2013 derailment in July also had only a one operator, an unusual practice in the North American railway industry. The only other railway cleared to run one-person trains in Canada was the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway. Quebec Provincial Police said they received a call about 7:30am yesterday about the train's derailment in a remote location north of Sept-AŽles. Police had difficulty accessing the site, about 950 kilometers  northeast of Montreal. Toronto Stock Exchange-listed Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corp owns 15 percent of the company, and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp owns 26 percent.","Locomotive plunged into river, dragging a half-dozen freight cars .

"Chris Froome will return to cycling in Spain this weekend after being forced to abandon the Tour de France last month. The 2013 Tour de France winner leads a nine-man Team Sky line-up featuring fellow Brits Peter Kennaugh and Luke Rowe at the Vuelta a Espana. Froome, 29, was forced to abandon his Tour de France title defence on stage five because of a fractured wrist. Back in the saddle: Chris Froome, pictured here receiving attention after crashing in the Tour de France, will return at the Vuelta a Espana this weekend .

"Low vitamin D levels could make childbirth more painful, scientists have warned in a new study. A team in the US discovered women were more likely to opt for an epidural to ease their pain if they were Vitamin D deficient. The scientists measured the vitamin D levels of 93 pregnant women prior to them delivering their babies. All of the women had requested an epidural for the pain during labour. Low vitamin D levels could make childbirth more painful, scientists have warned in a new study . The team then measured how much pain medication each woman required during labour. They compared the quantity of pain medication used by women with higher vitamin D levels to those of the women with lower vitamin D levels. The findings, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists in New Orleans, showed women with lower vitamin D levels required more pain medication than those with higher levels. Dr Andrew Geller, an anesthesiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and senior author of the study, said: 'Women often experience lower than normal levels of vitamin D during pregnancy. 'We found that patients with low levels of vitamin D experienced an increase in pain during childbirth.' While vitamin D deficiency has long been associated with depression and pain, this is the first study to highlight the link with pain levels during childbirth. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said vitamin D deficiency is common during pregnancy, particularly among high-risk groups including vegetarians, women with limited exposure to the sun and ethnic minorities. The findings, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists in New Orleans, showed women with lower vitamin D, pictured under the microscope, levels required more pain medication than those with higher levels . It is largely found in fortified milk, juice, fish oils and dietary supplements. The authors of the study noted an estimated 41 per cent of pregnant women in the US are deficient in vitamin D, with another 41 per cent having insufficient levels. Dr Geller said: 'Given the research results, prevention and treatment of low vitamin D levels in pregnant women may have a significant impact on decreasing labor pain in millions of women every year. 'This topic needs to be revisited and additional research should be conducted to determine how we can improve the labor experience for women everywhere.'","US study examined 93 pregnant women as they gave birth .

"Salford maintained their slim hopes of qualifying for the play-off's with Kevin Locke notching 14 points as they beat Catalan 34-22. Full-back Locke scored two tries and kicked three goals, while Junior Sau, Niall Evalds, Theo Fages and Tony Puletua also touched down as the Red Devils moved four points behind Catalan and Widnes with three games left. The visitors managed to run in four tries of their own, with Thomas Bosc adding three goals, but it was not enough. Attempt blocked: Daryl Millard  attacks the Salford defence during the Super League match in Manchester . Rangi Chase starred for Salford as he pulled the strings, but Sau was another a stand-out performer on a good night for the hosts at the AJ Bell Stadium. Locke was making only his third appearance since signing from New Zealand Warriors after recovering from injury, with Jason Walton reverting to the bench. Evalds also switched to the wing for Josh Griffin as the Red Devils aimed to avenge their 37-24 defeat at Catalan in May. Ian Henderson made his 100th appearance for the Dragons, who also welcomed centre Vincent Duport back from suspension. The visitors flew out of the blocks, pouncing on a spill from Evalds as Leon Pryce created the opening try for Michael Oldfield in the corner after seven minutes. Elliot Whitehead's crunching tackle forced Lama Tasi to lose possession, but Salford hit back with a surging run from skipper Adrian Morley before Locke took Chase's pass to go over after 11 minutes. Locke booted the difficult conversion to fire the Red Devils ahead 6-4 and they increased the lead when Sau charged through Jason Baitieri's tackle to power over under the posts for his 12th try of the season. Scorer: Tony Puletua (centre) managed to get himself on the scoresheet in Salford's win over Catalan . A touch of class from Chase almost brought another try shortly after, but the bounce just eluded Evalds. However, they were able to take full advantage of a high tackle by Greg Mounis on Chase to extend their lead, with Locke adding his second try on the half hour and his third conversion made it 18-4. Fages went close again for Salford, who were in rip-roaring form against a side that had only beaten Bradford and London on their travels this season. There was no stopping the Red Devils, who moved into a 22-4 lead at half-time, with sub Jason Walton putting Evalds over in the corner with a smart pass after Chase had sidestepped the dangerous Whitehead. Catalan needed a score early in the second half and Mounis obliged with Bosc adding the conversion. Chase forced the Dragons into successive drop-outs from under their own posts after teasing kicks on the sixth tackle. The pressure had to tell sooner or later and it was no surprise when Fages took Harrison Hansen's pass to plunge over and give Salford another 18-point cushion. Chase took over the goalkicking duties and made no mistake. Salford sealed the win on the hour with Tony Puletua crashing over from short range, with Tasi supplying the pass and Chase adding his second conversion. The Red Devils' sterling defence will have pleased coach Iestyn Harris but Whitehead would have scored had he not dropped a pass from Louis Anderson's impressive break. Mason Caton-Brown raced back to stop Morgan Escare - no mean feat - but Duport diCatd manage a third try for Catalan with Bosc booting his 500th goal for the club. Catalan finished the scoring with a late try from Henderson on his landmark appearance, with Bosc kicking the conversion but it was little more than a consolation.","Kevin Locke bagged 14 points for the Salford Red Devils against Catalan .

"Rory McIlroy wants to become one of the greatest golfers of all time after winning The Open on Sunday for his third major championship success at the age of just 25. The Northern Irishman admitted he had rediscovered his passion for the game after a tumultuous 12 months that saw him suffer the lowest point of his career at Muirfield last year when he missed the cut, split from his fiancee Caroline Wozniacki and became embroiled in a nasty legal dispute with his former manager.

I just want to look forward now and win as many as I can, because I feel there’s a lot more left in me.’ McIlroy won by two shots from American Rickie Fowler and Spaniard Sergio Garcia at the end of a marvellous day of drama played out before a raucous but almost impeccably behaved crowd at Royal Liverpool. The one discordant note was a heckler who persistently put McIlroy off before Rory had him thrown out. ‘He was giving me grief all day,’ he said. ‘I put up with it for the first 15 holes and then he deliberately coughed on my downswing on the 16th tee. Winner: Rory McIlroy has won his third Grand Slam at the age of 25, becoming only the third to do so . Lead from the front: McIlroy now only needs to win The Masters to complete a career Grand Slam . ‘I still hit a great drive but I heard it halfway down and knew who it was, so I had him chucked out.’ After becoming the first European in the modern era to win three different majors, McIlroy added: ‘I’m immensely proud  of myself. To sit here at  my age and be  three-quarters of the way to a career Grand Slam, I never dreamed of being at this point in my career so quickly. ‘This feels unbelievable. Being someone from around here, The Open was the one you really wanted to win growing up, and the one you holed putts on the putting green to win, to beat the likes of Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Ernie Els. The more I keep looking at the trophy and seeing my name on it, the more it will start sinking in.’ McIlroy said in January that he wanted to win two majors this year and the season’s final one, the USPGA Championship, is now just a fortnight away.

Garcia said sportingly: ‘It was a great week and Rory is a deserved champion.’ McIlroy’s father Gerry won £50,000 for a £100 bet he had a decade ago on his son to win the Open before the age of 26. ‘It’s a nice little bonus for him,’ said Rory, smiling.","McIlroy won for the first time at the Open, his third Grand Slam title .

"Arsenal host Manchester City in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, looking to avenge their humiliating 6-3 defeat by Manuel Pellegrini's side at the Etihad last season. The Gunners are unbeaten after a win against Crystal Palace and draws with Everton and Leicester, while the champions suffered a surprise home loss to Stoke City last time out. It's sure to be an intriguing battle at the Emirates, but who will come out on top? Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp evaluates each team to decide. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Arsenal vs Manchester City preview . Wojciech Szczesny - 7/10 . I always get the feeling he can do something erratic but he has improved immensely. Mathieu Debuchy - 7.5 . Looks like he's been at Arsenal a long time. Enjoys defending and plays with aggression. Mathieu Debuchy has settled in quickly at Arsenal after joining from Newcastle during the summer . Calum Chambers - 7.5 . Great start to his Arsenal career and so mature for his age, but today will be his biggest test. Laurent Koscielny - 8 . He's got pace, is tenacious in his defending and reads it well. Has to be on his A game. Laurent Koscielny is certain to start in the heart of the Gunners' back four against Manchester City . Kieran Gibbs - 7 . Lovely left back but still to prove he's top-class. A run of games without injuries would help. Mikel Arteta - 8 . Technically fantastic and vital as captain, but in big games his lack of pace can show him up. Jack Wilshere - 8 . Mathieu Flamini did well in this game last year so he could play. Wilshere offers more going forward. Jack Wilshere should be in confident mood after anchoring England's midfield against Switzerland . Aaron Ramsey - 9 . lf he's fit, he has to play. He drives this team forward and has become one of Europe's best midfielders. Alexis Sanchez - 9 . Great credentials and a big goal against Besiktas to get started. Lots of competition but such an important player. Alexis Sanchez already has two Arsenal goals to his name after arriving from Barcelona for £30million . Santi Cazorla - 8.5 . I don't know what his best foot is but he's a magician. Has technique, balance and bravery. Danny Welbeck - 8 . If he needs motivation, he got it from Louis van Gaal. No excuses now — needs to get in good positions and score. Danny Welbeck looks set to make his debut against Manchester City after joining Arsenal on deadline day . TEAM TOTAL - 87.5/110 . Arsene Wenger - 8 . The pressure is off after winning the FA Cup but he still needs midfield and defensive cover. Danny Welbeck is a good signing and Wenger is now one of our greatest hopes for producing good English players. Power off the bench - 8.5 . Per Mertesacker and Flamini provide plenty of defensive experience while Mesut Ozil, if he's fit, is capable of moments of magic if Wenger needs to get creative. Joe Hart - 9 . Overcame difficulties last season but impressive for England and now in the top five in the world. Joe Hart (left) makes a brave punch during the 3-1 win against Manchester City at the Etihad . Pablo Zabaleta - 9 . Love him. Epitomises everything good about foreign players in the Premier League. Plays with energy and passion. Vincent Kompany - 9 . Can struggle with injuries but a colossus and one of the best centre backs in Premier League history. Captain Vincent Kompany will be aiming for a clean sheet when his side visit the Emirates on Saturday . Martin Demichelis - 7.5 . Bit of a laughing stock when he arrived but answered his critics. With Eliaquim Mangala around, he has to keep it up. Gael Clichy - 7.5 . Rotates with Aleksandar Kolarov so stays fresh. Not much between the two but Clichy can be vulnerable. Samir Nasri - 8 . Underestimated but very talented. Will need some earplugs because he'll get plenty of stick. Samir Nasri will face a hostile atmosphere when he returns to his former club Arsenal . Fernandinho - 8 . A disappointing World Cup but comfortable on the ball and a good minder for Toure. Yaya Toure - 9 . Monster of a midfielder. Yet to hit the heights of last year but it's only a matter of time. Yaya Toure is the driving force in Manchester City's midfield but he has not found top form yet . David Silva - 9 . A maestro. Has balance, poise and genius in his feet. I could watch him all day. Sergio Aguero - 9 . One of the best in the world, barring injuries. With a good run, he's a goal-a-game man. Sergio Aguero bends the ball beyond Tim Krul to seal a 2-0 win at Newcastle in City's first game of the season . Edin Dzeko - 8 . No longer just a super sub. Improving under Manuel Pellegrini and playing with the confidence strikers need. TEAM TOTAL - 93/110 . Manuel Pellegrini - 8 . The antithesis of Roberto Mancini. Doesn't fall out with his senior players and looks to get them on side. Poor result against Stoke, so he will not want another. City have not lost two straight league games since October 2010. Power off the bench - 8 . Excellent defensive options in Kolarov and Mangala. Jesus Navas can stretch a game or James Milner can shore it up, but with Stevan Jovetic out they are light on attacking options.","Arsenal host Manchester City at the Emirates in Sunday's lunchtime game .

"Can it really be 10 years since Cesc Fabregas made his first Premier League start as an unknown 17-year-old for Arsenal against the likes of Nigel Martyn, Alan Stubbs and Kevin Campbell at Goodison Park? That Fabregas will enjoy his second debut in top-flight English football a decade later in his prime at 27 only serves to highlight the remarkably young age he gate-crashed the Arsenal first team. The teenager played 46 games that season in all competitions. On this occasion, and for campaigns to come, he will be wearing the blue of Chelsea – a sight to stick in the craw of those supporters who hailed him a hero from the first burst into the box. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cesc Fabregas score his first goal for Chelsea with a freekick . Settled in: New Chelsea signing Cesc Fabregas (centre) looks happy to be part of Jose Mourinho's fine squad . Quick start: The Spaniard has impressed during Chelsea's pre-season, gaining high praise from Mourinho . Admirer: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has publicly praised Fabregas' impact at Chelsea in pre-season . Premier League record: Here are Fabregas' stats in the Premier League when he was an Arsenal player . Arsene Wenger passed up the option to buy his former captain with Mesut Ozil already in his ranks and Alexis Sanchez on his way. Jose Mourinho, recognising the need to replace the impetus Frank Lampard provided from midfield, acted swiftly to bring the Spanish World Cup winner to Stamford Bridge for £30million. It could prove the signing of the summer. Already in pre-season Fabregas has reminded of his talents. A stunning 30-yard free-kick against Vitesse Arnhem was followed by a solo goal in the last friendly against Ferencvaros in which he dribbled into the area, bamboozled defenders, and slotted into the corner. Stuck in: Fabregas will have to re-adapt to the physical aspect of playing the Premier League with Chelsea . They were the kind of clinical contributions that made Mourinho say: ‘Frank is the history of the club, history nobody can forget. Fabregas is the future; history is history but the future is more important at the moment. ‘My opinion, and the opinion of my players, is that Fabregas is the right player to occupy that central position in midfield.’ Diego Costa would surely endorse such an appraisal. The striker has linked up well with Fabregas, who should provide assists more frequently than the finishing touch himself. Summer spending: Chelsea have signed Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis during this window . VIDEO Costa a key signing - Mourinho . A cutting edge in the final third became Fabregas’s hallmark during eight years at Arsenal, where he would drive on from midfield before picking a pass to unlock defences. He moved to Barcelona in 2011 with 98 assists and 57 goals in 303 appearances, leaving a chasm in Wenger’s side. But his time at the Nou Camp was spent more in the shadows. It was always going to be that way with Lionel Messi the shining beacon. Fabregas did score 42 goals and created 48 assists in 151 matches for the Catalans but was far from a regular starter and often played out of position. To rub salt in any wounds Barcelona released a statement after he was sold to Chelsea claiming the fee was good business because his performances often trailed off as the season progressed. Former Gunner: Fabregas spent eight years at Arsenal and used to captain Chelsea's north London rivals . Combined with Wenger’s snub it means he returns to England with something of a point to prove. That might sound disingenuous considering this is a player with one World Cup and two European Championship medals to his name, but Barca only won one La Liga title during his stay. For Arsenal, there was an FA Cup victory in 2005 but nothing else. His standing in the game would be instantly lifted were he to provide the thrust that sent Chelsea to the Premier League summit come May and Mourinho is the perfect manager to pinpoint such a mental trigger. The Portuguese’s own ego will be bruised from two seasons without a domestic title and he will apply the right psychology to generate a fighting reaction from Fabregas. You can imagine him emerging at Stamford Bridge this season as a midfielder with an aggressive edge. Moved home: The Spaniard headed home to Barcelona in 2011 and won the La Liga title in 2013 with the club . Robust: The 27-year-old could be the catalyst for Chelsea success this season by commanding their midfield . He will first take the field against Burnley at Turf Moor on Monday night and it is then we will see how Mourinho’s reshaped team, with Fabregas at its heart, is looking. Chelsea have not won the Premier League since 2009-10 but are installed as favourites this time because of their signings and the fact Mourinho’s alchemy is so potent. Fabregas will be the catalyst on the pitch and his immediate impact must give Wenger cause for concern. He never seemed keen to re-sign the gem he polished but given he has enhanced a rival for the title a doubt over his decision may linger. The clamours to explain his call would grow were Fabregas to help bring the trophy he never won for Arsenal to his new club across London.","Spaniard moved to Stamford Bridge for £30million from Barcelona .

Following the service, daughter Kerry - a trainee osteopath - said: ‘At today's memorial service we witnessed the celebration of Ann Maguire’s 40 years of service to the education in Leeds. One of my mum’s life principles as a teacher was you could never put a limit on a child's potential. Attacked: Ann Maguire was stabbed as she taught at a school in Leeds in April . ‘We, the family, would like to thank all those who’ve lent their support over the past few months, those who’ve been involved in the preparation of today’s service, and all in attendance today.’ Her other daughter, Emma, who trained at the Royal Ballet School and has been a soloist of the Royal Ballet since 2011, told the BBC: 'I think what we took away was that we have so many of our own stories and memories of Mummy and we are so grateful people chose to share theirs.' During the service, children’s choirs from the diocese of Leeds, including the Corpus Christi choir, led the hymns and a group of pupils and teachers from the school performed a rendition of The Beatles’ song My Life. In a filmed compilation of tributes, pupils who were asked to use one word to describe Mrs Maguire said she was 'perfect', 'passionate', 'fantastic', 'amazing' and 'warm'.

A minute's silence was held for the Spanish teacher during the service and across the rest of Leeds today. Her nephews Daniel and Andrew Poole, who were raised by Mrs Maguire after their mother's death, paid tribute to her in the service. They said: 'You were a natural, wonderful mother - and you nurtured and loved us through every stage of our lives. 'And I know for every memory that we have shared here today, there will be thousands more for children all over Leeds from many, many different walks of life. 'All who are better for knowing you, and all who are grateful for the shelter and comfort we found in your loving embrace.

"As if any further evidence were needed that bald results scalp plain reason in football, it has been forthcoming in the reaction to two matches this midweek. The 4-0 defeat of Manchester United’s virtual reserve team at MK Dons provided an eye-popping score-line, sure enough. But it is not by a headlining exit from that little old cup, which changes its identity more often than Spurs swap managers, that Louis van Gaal will be judged. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: A new team is not built in one month . Don for: Anderson and his Manchester United team-mates look forlorn at stadium:mk . Tough start: Louis van Gaal has failed to lead Manchester United to victory so far this season . Old Trafford was in a hiatus of transition before this happened and will continue to be so while the latest boss struggles to correct this listing juggernaut. A big win, rather than a heavy loss, in the backwater of Milton Keynes would have done nothing whatsoever to change that. Nor is it by any means certain that spending £60million on the last player they thought of will do so, either. Until this week Angel di Maria was down there somewhere below the washing powder on United’s shopping list. Of course he is a pretty good footballer. But a Messi, a Ronaldo, a Neymar – or even a Rooney or a Van Persie – he is not. Di Maria’s goal per game ratio is proof of that - only 22 in 124 La Liga appearances for Real Madrid, seven in 76 for Benfica before that, just 10 in 52 games for Argentina. Those statistics may come to take on far greater relevance for Van Gaal than the goals-against tally on Tuesday evening. As for the second of our misleading matches, Arsenal were hailed from the roof-tops for scraping past Besiktas into the Champions League proper. Pardon me for not coming over all faint with excitement. So far our resident refereeing guru, Graham Poll, is one of the few to have pointed out that the Turks were deprived of not one, but two blatant first half penalties. Had Besiktas converted only one of them, Arsenal would have been out and the vultures would have been swooping down on them, too. Arsene Wenger was his usual oblivious self to such niceties. He went so far as to complain that Mathieu Debuchy did not deserve to be sent off for a second yellow card, even though he should have been shown a red one earlier for the last-man foul which was Arsenal’s second unpunished penalty offence. Wenger is a good man, an exceptional manager and a purveyor of fine football – so I prefer to observe that he was reacting out of relief at this escape, not with jubilation. Easing the burden: Alexis Sanchez (left) and Jack Wilshere celebrate the Chile star's goal against Besiktas . VIDEO Sanchez showed fighting spirit - Wenger . A Spur-of-the-moment decision? Sanchez and his Tottenham-crested cap . He has reason to do so. His purchase of Alexis Sanchez for £30m would have become an almost intolerable financial burden had Arsenal not advanced to the treasure-laden stage of the Champions League. Sanchez eased the burden by scoring the only goal at the Emirates on Wednesday. However, Barcelona’s Chilean reject did not play anything like as wonderfully as some of his reviewers proclaimed. It was also depressing to see pictures of him emerging hours later from the same Chinawhite night spot in London which has become a garish symbol of the Premier League footballer’s clubbing habit. Not that he has picked up on all the culture just yet. He was wearing a cap emblazoned with a Tottenham-like cockerel. It is thanks to Sanchez that Arsenal have qualified in the Champions League for a 17th consecutive season. That is a tremendous achievement by Wenger and yes, overall Arsenal were better than Besiktas. But on current form, United are not much worse than Arsenal. Not, amid all the hysteria, that you would know it. Blatter staying as FIFA president is a victory for football . Michel Platini has counted the numbers. They do not add up in his favour. So it will be carry on Sepp as president of FIFA for another four years. And whether the anti-Blatter brigade like it or not, there are millions of perfectly good reasons why that status quo is being maintained. There are the hundreds of millions of World Cup dollars which Blatter channels into the support and development of football around the world, as well as into the construction of whole villages to house the game’s impoverished families. Contrast that with Platini’s fiefdom, UEFA, using much of its power and resources to further swell the coffers of the richest clubs in Europe. For more years: Sepp Blatter (right), with Michel Platini (left) at the World Cup in Brazil . No wonder the wealthy Europeans – England and our bloated Premier League among them – would like to see the back of Blatter. Unsurprising, also, that all their propaganda falls on unreceptive ears elsewhere and that the rest of the world’s football confederations are standing solidly behind Blatter, the man who has negotiated on-going World Cup television and marketing deals more enormous than most believed possible. While the Manchesters and Madrids of Planet Football are spending obscene fortunes on buying and paying players, FIFA by-and-large finance the game’s poorer rather than noisier neighbours. Given that FIFA – in economic terms as well as its sphere of influence – operates on the scale of the government of a medium-sized nation, it is inevitable that some of its investments will fall into unscrupulous hands. What happened, after all, to so much of the Live Aid money once it disappeared into Africa? Nothing is perfect, FIFA included. But there is a missionary element to its work under Blatter which is virtually missing from UEFA… and from our own Football Association, come to that. The ultimate prize: Germany celebrate winning the World Cup in the summer . Even the flawed and much-derided awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar – which the president himself admits was a mistake given the summer heat in the Middle East – was born as much of that zeal as by the fortune to be made there. Inferior: Spain celebrate winning the European Championship but it isn't a patch on the World Cup . The ensuing allegations of corruption have been followed by sabre-rattling here about European nations boycotting Qatar and, for political reasons, the intervening 2018 World Cup in Russia. Oh really? The best players on earth will go along with that, will they? Not if you were watching the Finals in Brazil this summer. The intensity with which those stars competed for the greatest prize of all far surpassed anything we see now in the Premier and Champions Leagues. There are millions of perfectly good reasons for that, too. Nothing enhances the earning power or the advertising, endorsement and image rights of the modern footballer like a good World Cup. Certainly not the European Championship of nations, by the way, which falls well short of the World Cup in terms of excitement. So Monsieur Platini will go back to ‘my work with UEFA,’ a job he would have been obliged to relinquish had he taken a tilt at the FIFA presidency which would have been doomed to failure. Herr Blatter will continue to confound the witch-hunters while delivering more lucrative World Cups for everyone. And while this may not be everyone’s ideal, at least in this area of global governance peace has broken out. If Mackay typifies football, what of the Rotherham scandal? Those murky texts from Malky and his mate – banter as he described those racist and homophobic nuances – seem to have dropped below the radar already.

"Alastair Cook has called for cricket authorities and helmet manufacturers to continue to work tirelessly on player safety following the tragic death of Phillip Hughes. A sombre-looking Cook made his plea in Colombo the day after the Australian batsman died from a blow to an unprotected part of his head, below the left ear, which he received during a domestic match in Sydney on Tuesday. The England squad joined in with a Twitter-led initiative, hashtagged ‘putoutyourbats’, in honour of Hughes. They lined up their bats after a training session at the R Premadasa Stadium ahead of this morning’s second one-day international against Sri Lanka, and placed one navy blue Test cap on each handle. VIDEO Scroll down to watch . England captain Alastair Cook walks out during a rain-interrupted training session in Colombo . England captain Cook said Phillip Hughes' death marked a 'tragic day for cricket' The ECB posted a picture of their tribute to Hughes at their headquarters at Lord's in London . England put their bats outside their dressing room in memory of Hughes on Friday in Colombo . Phillip Hughes died at the age of 25 at St Vincent's Hospital after being struck in the back of the head by a ball . England captain Cook was visibly upset when talking about Hughes' tragic death . ‘We should keep working as hard as we can, through the manufacturers and the authorities, to make cricket as safe as possible,’ said Cook. ‘This is a reminder to everyone that we can’t take anything for granted. We’ve got to keep improving player safety, even though improvements since I started playing cricket have gone through the roof, especially with helmets.’ Helmet safety has been a pressing issue in the game ever since 2008, when the ECB’s injury surveillance programme looked into head injuries incurred by batsmen wearing helmets. Of 35 verifiable incidents around the world between 2003 and 2012, six batsmen were struck on the back of the helmet, and two more — like Hughes — on the unguarded part of the neck or lower head. Most helmet safety tests have focused on preventing the ball from penetrating the gap between the helmet’s peak and its grille, or ensuring the grille doesn’t impact on the face after being struck by the ball. But Cricket Australia have launched an investigation into player safety, while Sri Lanka’s veteran batsman Kumar Sangakkara told Sportsmail: ‘The helmet should be longer at the back to protect vital areas of the head and balance both freedom of movement and safety. It needs to be as safe as possible. I’m sure the ICC as a governing body can step in to ensure safer equipment standards.’ Sangakkara said he had spent time looking online at protective headgear in other sports, including American football.

Thisara Perera (right) celebrates the wicket of Joe Root during Sri Lanka's first one-day international victory . A tribute to Phillip Hughes which circulated on Twitter following his death at the age of 25 . The ICC declined to comment on the issue, but research into player attitudes has suggested that not all of them are keen to embrace the new, safer models. Reasons for this vary: the older models tend to be lighter, while the players believe they offer better visibility. They may even feel more comfortable in a helmet they have worn for longer. Privately, some within the England camp are also concerned that extending the helmet to cover sensitive areas at the back of the head would curtail their freedom of movement. England and Sri Lanka discussed postponing today’s match — the second in a series of seven — but Cook said: ‘We thought showing respect and playing the game in his honour was the right thing to do.’ The England squad have, understandably, found it tough to focus on cricket since news came through that Hughes had died, and Cook admitted that today’s game would inevitably be played at a lower level of intensity. But he insisted it would be wrong for fast bowlers to hold back on bouncers in the wake of the short ball delivered to Hughes by New South Wales seamer Sean Abbott. ‘This is a tragic accident,’ said Cook. ‘I don’t think we should change the way cricket is played. If you’re going to play a game, you’ve got to do it properly. What’s happened in the last three days has certainly clarified in my mind that it’s just a game of sport.

"Scotland coach Grant Bradburn has confirmed Preston Mommsen will captain the side at next year's ICC Cricket World Cup. The Saltires chief has also announced Kyle Coetzer will be vice-captain for the tournament, which gets underway on February 14 in Australia and New Zealand. Mommsen played a pivotal role as Scotland clinched their place in competition. The 27-year-old put in an impressive display during the World Cup qualification tournament, staged in New Zealand last January, as he scored 520 runs in eight innings on his way to being named Player of the Tournament. Preston Mommsen has been in impressive form for Scotland and was named associate player of the year . He has compiled 684 runs after 26 one-day internationals with an average of 31.09. His highest score of 139 came against the UAE in the final of the qualifying tournament. His leadership skills also played a part as Mommsen was named as the 2014 ICC Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year. He takes over the captaincy duties on a permanent basis from Northamptonshire's Coetzer, who skippered the side for most of the last two years. Mommsen said: 'It's a huge honour to be leading the Scotland team into the 2015 Cricket World Cup. This group of players have been together for a couple of years now, and this has always been the dream. 'It's an exciting time for everyone involved in Scottish cricket and hopefully our performances in Australia and New Zealand will help promote the game, and inspire the next generation in Scotland.' Mommsen will lead Scotland at the World Cup where they will play six times, including against England . Bradburn added: 'We have a strong squad line-up and excellent leaders in Preston and Kyle, as we prepare to play some international cricketing giants on the world stage next February in New Zealand. 'We don't underestimate the challenge but we have been training hard and will be bringing our absolute best to this hugely important global event.' Scotland will play at least six matches during the tournament, opening their Pool A campaign with a sold-out clash against co-hosts New Zealand in Dunedin on February 17. England are next up in Christchurch on February 23 before the Scots return to Dunedin three days later to face Afghanistan. Bangladesh will provide the opposition in Nelson on March 5, with Sri Lanka next on the schedule on March 11 in Hobart, the same venue for their final group game against Australia on March 14.","Preston Mommsen is ICC Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year .

"Ukip is planning to fight for 100 seats at the next election, with a third of voters saying they are prepared to back Nigel Farage. Paul Sykes, the party’s biggest donor, revealed he is ready to write a cheque for £1.5million to bankroll the ambitious push. As Tory divisions deepen over how to respond to the Eurosceptic threat, a new poll put Ukip on 18 per cent, with one in three people willing to back the party if they thought they could win in their local area. Almost a third of people say they would be willing to support Ukip if they thought Mr Farage's party could win in the constituency where they live . Mr Farage has overseen an extraordinary surge in popularity since Ukip won the European elections in May. In August, Douglas Carswell became the first Tory MP to defect to Ukip, and weeks later Mark Reckless followed him. The Rochester and Strood by-election triggered by Mr Reckless’ decision to quit is seen as a crucial test of the Tory ability to halt the Ukip bandwagon. But two polls have now put Ukip ahead by as many as 13 points, leading party strategists to reconsider their tactics for the general election. Mr Farage had suggested the party would aim for around 25 to 30 MPs in May 2015. But Mr Sykes told the Sunday Times: ‘Our finances are now rebuilding again after the European election victory, but we will be raising significant further funds for a national campaign and a strong push to target marginal seats, probably nearer 100 than the 30-40 we originally identified.’ Mr Sykes, a multi-millionaire, bankrolled a series of hard-hitting campaign posters in the run-up to May's Euro elections. Paul Sykes, one of Ukip's biggest donors, bankrolled a series of hard-hitting campaign posters in the run-up to May's Euro elections and will do so again . Labour and the Conservatives are neck and neck on 33 per cent, according to the latest Opinium poll, with Ukip on 18 per cent and the Lib Dems languishing on just 6 per cent . He revealed there would be no limit on the ambitions of the Ukip push for seats. ‘You’re going to be able to see this campaign from the moon. ‘Ukip is not going to lose the campaign because we don’t have enough adverts.’ A new Opinium poll for the Observer puts Ukip on 18 per cent, well ahead of the Lib Dems who have slumped to just 6 per cent. The Tories and Labour are tied on 33 per cent. However, the poll also shows that many more people would be willing to vote Ukip if they thought they stood a chance of securing an MP. Some 31 per cent say they would back Mr Farage’s party if they thought they could win in the constituency they live in. Almost half (49 per cent) disagree, while 18 per cent neither agree nor disagree. The Conservatives are still grappling with how to respond to the Ukip threat, with differing views about whether pandering to them will lose votes on the centre ground. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon insisted only a Conservative government could give opponents of the EU here referendum which would end Britain's membership . Defence Secretary Michael Fallon today pleaded with even voters who want to leave the European Union to stay with the Tories. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'If you want change in Europe, if you want a referendum on Europe, if you are against Europe and want to leave, the only party that will give yu that vote is the Conservatives.' Pressed on whether the Tories will lose in Rochester, Mr Fallon insisted: 'We are not planning to fail there.' He said voters understand that 'Ukip cannot actually deliver with one MP or two MPs, they are not a party that can deliver a government'. Former immigration minister Damian Green warned against calls for the Tories to do a deal with Ukip. He told the BBC: 'Whatever happens, it would be a complete disaster for the Tory party to become ‘Ukip-light’, or to do a pact with Ukip. 'There is a myth that some people foster, that you can simply add the current Ukip vote to the current Conservative vote, and produce a majority. 'Because, of course, if the Conservative party tries to turn itself into something like Ukip, tries to sound like Ukip, tries to adopt Ukip policies, it will haemorrhage voters in other parts of the political spectrum.'","Ukip donor Paul Sykes says he is ready to write a cheque for £1.5million .

"Michael Clarke has written an emotional tribute to Phillip Hughes, saying he was ‘a better man for having known him’ and promising 'I will miss you forever, but I will not forget'. Hughes, who died on Thursday after being hit by a bouncer in a domestic match in Sydney two days earlier, would have been 26 on Sunday. Clarke used the occasion to remember his former team-mate and one of his closest friends. ‘His cricketing achievements — of which there were many — really play second fiddle to the human qualities that he exhibited,’ wrote the Australian captain. Michael Clarke was brought to tears during a press conference on Saturday morning . Australia's cricket captain sent a message to the family of the late Phillip Hughes . Clarke and Hughes share a joke as they bat for Australia . ‘Loyal to a fault, eternally optimistic, kind hearted, wicked sense of humour, a childlike verve for life … I really could go on and on. ‘I don’t think in 12 years of playing cricket at the top level I have ever come across a more loyal or generous-hearted team-mate. ‘I don’t have a blood brother, but I am very proud to have called Phillip my brother. I am a better man for having known him. ‘Vale Hugh Dog. I will miss you forever, but I will not forget.

Clarke said he asked for Hughes's One Day International shirt number to be retired, Cricket Australia agreed . Clarke was clearly distraught as he was led away after addressing the press . Clarke also used his newspaper column to offer words of consolation to Sean Abbott, the 22-year-old New South Wales seamer who was bowling when Hughes was hit, saying he was not to blame in anyway and ‘deserves our full support’. Hughes’ funeral will take place in his home town of Macksville on Wednesday, while the first Test between Australia and India at Brisbane, which was due to begin the following day and was expected to feature Hughes’ return to Test cricket, has been postponed.

The Test at Brisbane’s Gabba could then be staged at a later date.

"So close to a morale-boosting victory in tricky circumstances, Liverpool’s defence crumbled again to let their lead slip against Ludogorets and raise fresh questions. Individual errors from Simon Mignolet, Kolo Toure, and Alberto Moreno allowed the Bulgarian champions two goals  but collectively there were issues too. Martin Skrtel and Javi Manquillo struggled at times to get their communication sorted allowing the nimble Ludogorets attackers opportunities to outmanoeuvre them. Glen Johnson was also flat-footed for the late equaliser. The Liverpool players look dejected after conceding a late equaliser against Ludogorets on Wednesday . Liverpool's shaky defence has now conceded 13 goals from set pieces this season . Brendan Rodgers needs to find a solution to his defensive problems, but does he have the personnel? Leadership is lacking across the backline and it tells a story that a £20million defender in Dejan Lovren is left on the bench for such a big game. In 19 games this season, Liverpool have conceded 29 goals already – but more worryingly, 13 from set pieces. A seriously bad figure. So how does each player rate? Simon Mignolet . Jamie Carragher believes the Belgian goalkeeper needs taking out of the side, such are his troubles. Simon Mignolet made a terrible error for Ludogorets' first goal in Bulgaria, allowing Dani Abalo to score . Mignolet has faced calls to be dropped after a series of mistakes have cost Liverpool points . He was awful in Sofia, shaky on crosses and failing to gather a routine shot to concede the opening goal. There are doubts he is up to the task at all and there are too many instances where he could do better. Glen Johnson . He has lost his place in the England team due to uninspiring form but has featured 10 times for Liverpool this term. Glen Johnson was generally solid on Wednesday, but his poor form has seen him lose his England place . Against Ludogorets he operated at left back and was generally sound but failed to provide an offensive thrust. He did not to react quick enough at the corner which brought the late leveller. Dejan Lovren . Where has the form gone that saw him star for Southampton? Maybe Jose Fonte deserves more recognition. Dejan Lovren (second left) was left on the bench against Ludogorets after his shaky start to the season . The former Southampton defender has looked poor value for money after his £20million transfer this summer . Nothing like a £20m defender, Lovren has played 17 games but rarely looked assured. Too often a diver into tackles, when standing off would pay dividends. Martin Skrtel . Another with 17 games under his belt this season, it has become increasingly clear his style is edging over the line of legality too frequently. Martin Skrtel dives into a tackle  - the defender has already picked up six bookings this season . Penalised against Crystal Palace for grabbing hold of shirts, that is a tactic that ultimately will harm more than it helps. He has been booked six times already. Kolo Toure . Emerged with credit from the reserve side sent out at the Bernabeu at the start of November but Lodogorets was his first match in a month and just his fifth of the season. Despite a good performance against Real Madrid last month, Kolo Toure has been used sparingly . A poor clearance allowed the first goal, sleepy marking the second. It was his man who scored. Mamadou Sakho . Just five games this season for the France centre half who cost £18million last summer and none since late September due to a thigh injury. Given he only played 19 times last campaign the jury is still out. There does seem a good defender in there, but supporters at Anfield are yet to see him. Mamadou Sakho is back in training but hasn't played for Liverpool since September due to a thigh injury . Javi Manquillo . At 20, he may need time to adjust to the English game having come from Atletico Madrid. He only played nine senior games for the Spanish club before moving to Liverpool. Javi Manquillo has already played more games for Liverpool than he did in his time at Sevilla . He already has 14 matches under Brendan Rodgers. In Sofia, he never seemed sure who to pick up as Ludogorets interchanged positions. Alberto Moreno . Looked a proper player when driving down the left wing at White Hart Lane and dispatching an arrow into the bottom corner for his first Liverpool goal. But mistakes are common. Erred against Manchester City early in the season and, after coming on in Bulgaria, allowed his man to get a flick on at the corner that found an equaliser. After a promising start with an excellent goal against Tottenham, Alberto Moreno has looked out of his depth . Jose Enrique . Just four games for the full back this season, after losing his place to Jon Flanagan last campaign, and was part of the defence that got ripped apart by QPR in October. His last appearance due to a knee injury. Jose Enrique, who has not played since the scrappy win over QPR, has only four appearances this season . Amid a defence that is causing the Liverpool manager untold headaches, he can at least draw one positive. At least none of them are doing anything to attract the attentions of Barcelona or the like.

"Read Martin Samuel's match report from the Etihad . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany hailed 'special' Sergio Aguero as a player who can make the impossible possible following the Argentina striker's stunning Champions League hat-trick in a 3-2 win against Bayern Munich. City looked on course to suffer another European body blow after goals from Xabi Alonso and Robert Lewandowski saw Bayern overturn Aguero's penalty and give the Bundesliga side a 2-1 half-time lead. Bayern, despite losing Mehdi Benatia to a red card in the 20th minute, maintained that advantage until five minutes from time but then Aguero sensationally snatched all three points for City with two goals - the winner coming in stoppage time. Sergio Aguero's treble handed Manchester City a Champions League lifeline . Aguero watches on as his shot nestles into the corner to start City's fightback . The hat-trick continued Aguero's superb goalscoring form for City this season and Kompany admitted they were fortunate to have the 26-year-old in their ranks. He told ITV: 'If you want to succeed at anything, you need a special player in a special form, otherwise you just don't win anything. 'He's our special player and when he's in that form he makes things achievable that otherwise wouldn't be.' Aguero added: 'I'm very happy for us, the three points are very important. It was difficult but we are happy because this game was very important. It was a game we had to win.' Aguero is mobbed after scoring a dramatic winner in added time to send the Etihad into raptures . Vincent Kompany almost falls into Pep Guardiola after a challenge from Robert Lewandowski .

He said: 'I think that all the big teams need big players and Sergio is a big player, a top player, and he's very important. 'But I think the whole team continued playing with trust until the end today. 'The two goals that Bayern scored were unbelievable, but the whole team continued having trust in our work and our play until the end.' Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini looks after the match ball for hat-trick hero Aguero . The result leaves City level on five points with Roma and CSKA Moscow in Group E as they look to join already-qualified Bayern in the last 16.

"Click here to read Sportsmail's chief sports writer Martin Samuel's full report of the match from the Etihad Stadium . Even when Xabi Alonso was at his masterful best, pulling the strings on his 33rd birthday, Manchester City’s supporters stayed true to their team. In the end, they got a remarkable reward. Much has been made of the sterile atmosphere and yet the place was bouncing after Sergio Aguero’s brilliant hat-trick. What a night. When the Etihad is like this, you want the good times to roll for this team. They are a special group of supporters when they get behind their team. ‘We fight to the end’ they sang throughout this extraordinary clash with Pep Guardiola’s side and somehow emerged victorious. How? Who cares. Sergio Aguero flashes his abs in celebration after claiming the victory for Manchester City . City players pile on Aguero as they clinch a 3-2 comeback win over the Bundesliga giants . Sergio Aguero’s winner was something else, a throwback to the days when City’s disbelieving fans were on the road to their first Barclays Premier League title in 2012. More of this, please. All that was missing when Aguero sealed this incredible comeback was the Poznan, the celebration that followed some of the most dramatic moments in City’s recent history. It cranked up the volume, sending City’s supporters happy as their uneasy relationship with European football’s elite competition continues its journey. There is still a long way to go before they can match the special atmosphere on the Kop on those special European nights, but this was a start. Aguero slots a penalty to give City the lead after he was brought down after 20 minutes . Aguero celebrates his successful spot-kick as City went 1-0 up against the run of play . The Argentine powers his spot-kick beyond the outstretched hands of Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer . By the time they sang ‘Sergio, Sergio’ at the end, in the moments when he was walking off the field after his last minute substitution, this place was rocking. Despite the top four finishes, the two Barclays Premier League titles in three seasons, City haven’t quite taken to this competition. Still, the marketing bods tried to do their bit here. Before the teams walked out of the tunnel at the Etihad a few lads opposite the main stand began waving giant blue and white chequered flags in an effort to drum up an atmosphere. It still feels like a long time before they will cross the finishing line in the Champions League. City fans chanted 'Sergio, Sergio ' in appreciation for Aguero as their hero is substituted in the 94th minute . Fans united to say 'No matches behind closed doors' in response to CSKA Moscow's punishment for racist incidents that have seen them suffer in silent stadiums also . The Bayern fans got their wish initially as they supported their side but couldn't predict the final outcome . They should be relishing these nights - putting their spat with UEFA over their £50m fine for breaching FFP regulations behind them - and getting on with the business of the day. Bayern Munich are one of the biggest tickets in town right now, what with their poster boy team and a coach who would look at home on the cover of Esquire magazine. Bayern were down to 10 men following the dismissal of central defender Medhio Benatia in the 20th minute for a foul on Aguero inside the area. Aguero put them ahead, but Bayern - who completed 664 passes compared with City’s 444 - were still by far the more accomplished side. Their fans, were fresh from the pop-up bars in city centre hotels providing them with litres of Bitburger to down in the hours before kick-off, made a right racket in the South Stand. At the final whistle they drowned their sorrows. Bayern celebrate the goal from Xabi Alonso's clever free-kick which gave them a 2-1 lead going into half-time . Vincent Kompany remonstrates with his side after Bayern take the lead with Xabi Alonso's strike . They had stood for the full 90 minutes and urging Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski to pull this out of the bag. They got their wish, pretty much as we always knew they would. Those fans are a credit to their team, up there with the best behaved and most humorous travelling supporters in the sport. They were in raptures five minutes before the break, lifting their red and white Bayern scarves above their heads to celebrate Alonso’s clever free-kick. Then, just before the Czech referee Pavel Kralovec stopped for half-time, Lewandowski got in between Vincent Kompany and Bacary Sagna to head them in front. The place fell silent. Joe Hart celebrates as City's come-from-behind win keeps their Champions League dream alive . Bayern boss Pep Guardiola can barely watch as the game slips away from his stars . There had been brief moment of unity before kick-off, when supporters from both teams held up bright orange banners demanding ‘No to football behind closed doors’. Correctly, both clubs believe they have been punished by UEFA’s decision to order CSKA Moscow to play home games behind closed doors because of a racist incident. Still, the biggest crime here was just how Bayern Munich will return to Germany without, at the very least, a draw. When Aguero scored the the equaliser it was bedlam in the stands and it was then that this stadium, fans included, mustered everything they had. When he scored the winner, it felt like QPR all over again.","Manchester City defeated Bayern Munich 3-2 in comeback at the Etihad .

"Sergio Aguero scored a last-gasp winner - his third of the night - to fire Manchester City to a 3-2 win over Bayern Munich in Group E of the Champions League.

"Manuel Pellegrini claimed Sergio Aguero is the world’s best striker after his stunning hat-trick kept Manchester City’s Champions League dream alive. Aguero scored an incredible 90th minute winner - in scenes reminiscent of his famous goal against QPR on the final day of the 2012 season - to seal an unlikely 3-2 win against 10-man Bayern Munich.

We have won the first one and now we must beat Roma away. ‘This kind of victory is very important, we will see what happens in the last game and whether we have a mathematical chance to qualify. ‘My first thought is that we conceded two goals in the way we did and it is difficult to win from that position.

"A powerful typhoon was heading toward Tokyo on Sunday after lashing southern Japan, where it killed at least one U.S. airman on Okinawa island and left two others missing, officials said. Typhoon Phanfone was off the coast of Shikoku in southwestern Japan on Sunday night, packing winds of up to 144 kilometers (90 miles) per hour after hitting the southern regions of Okinawa and Kyushu, Japan's Meteorological Agency said. Three U.S. Air Force members were washed away by high waves Sunday, with one found dead and the other two still missing, Japan's coast guard said. Tsuguyoshi Miyagi, an official at the coast guard's Okinawa branch, said the airmen were on the island's northern coast. Scroll down for video . Pedestrians struggle to cross a street in Miyazaki, southern Japan, in heavy rain and strong winds caused by the powerful typhoon Phanfone onSunday . The Weather Channel says the strongest winds on Sunday evening are being felt in the southern Japan region, after the island of Kikaijima reported a peak gust of 94.4 mph . The U.S. Air Force confirmed that three of its airmen were washed out to sea and that one had died. It said the search for the other two had been interrupted by rough seas. The names of the three airmen were being withheld pending notification of their relatives, the Air Force said in a statement. Okinawa is home to about half of the roughly 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan. Several people on Kyushu island were injured in the typhoon. The storm also grounded more than 100 flights Sunday and caused power outages at more than 9,500 homes on Kyushu. In Suzuka, in central Japan, a French driver was severely injured following an accident in the Japanese Grand Prix which had to be shortened due to the heavy rain because conditions were deemed too dangerous. Formula One driver Jules Bianchi of the Marussia team went off the track at a turn and hit a recovery vehicle that was removing a car that had crashed earlier . An unconscious Bianchi was taken to a nearby hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for a severe head injury, and race officials said he was in critical condition. The storm triggered concerns of possible landslides on the ash-covered volcano in central Japan that erupted Sept. 27, killing at least 51 hikers. The search for a dozen people missing in the eruption was suspended Sunday due to rain from the approaching storm. The meteorological agency was predicting up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) of rain in central Japan by Monday morning.

"Prostate cancer drugs taken by thousands of men have been linked to fatal heart attacks in a study. US academics found the treatment trebled the likelihood of death among men with existing heart problems. However, cancer experts pointed out that the benefits of the life-extending treatment normally outweigh any possible risks. Some 41,700 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Britain each year, with most cases in patients over the age of 50. US academics found the treatment trebled the likelihood of death among men with existing heart problems . This is an age when they are also at increased risk of heart disease. It is estimated that more than 16,000 men in this country receive hormone treatment called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which was the focus of the Harvard University study. Researchers looked at 5,077 men with prostate cancer who were treated from 1997 to 2006, and particularly the risks of ADT drugs, which work by reducing the levels of certain hormones that fuel tumour growth. They found that in healthy men, or those with raised blood pressure or cholesterol, there was no link to deaths from heart attacks. But in men who had already suffered a heart attack or heart failure, which would weaken the heart muscle, the risk was three times higher. The researchers theorised that changes in hormone levels could also affect the heart. They concluded that the treatment should be avoided in patients with existing heart problems who have tumours which are slow growing and lower risk. In men who had already suffered a heart attack or heart failure, which would weaken the heart muscle, the risk was three times higher (File photo) Lead researcher Dr Paul Nguyen, whose study is published in the journal BJU International, said: ‘While androgen deprivation therapy can be a life-saving drug for men with prostate cancer and significantly increase the cure rates when used with radiation for aggressive disease, this study also raises the possibility that a small sub-group of men who have significant heart disease could experience increased cardiac death. Men who sleep with more than one woman in their lifetime are less likely to develop prostate cancer, research shows. Those who had 20 or more female sexual partners over their lives reduced their risk by 28 per cent compared to those with one. And virgins were twice as likely to be diagnosed than sexually experienced men. The study involved 3,208 men who had answered questions about their lifestyle and sex lives. The Canadian researchers said that a higher frequency of sexual encounters could help prevent the cancer. Lead researcher Professor Marie-Elise Parent, from the University of Montreal, explained: ‘It is possible that having many female sexual partners results in a higher frequency of ejaculations, whose protective effect against prostate cancer has been previously observed in cohort studies. We now know that the number and type of partners must be taken into account to better understand the causes of prostate cancer.’ Other experts have speculated that having lots of sex could reduce the concentration of cancer-causing substances in the semen. Despite the findings, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Professor Parent cautioned against men using the findings to be promiscuous. ‘I would still say that for men with significant heart problems, we should try to avoid ADT when it is not necessary – such as for men with low-risk disease or men receiving ADT only to shrink the prostate prior to radiation. However, for men with high-risk disease, in whom the prostate cancer benefits of ADT likely outweigh any potential cardiac harms, ADT should be given even if they have heart problems, but the patient should be followed closely by a cardiologist to ensure that he is being carefully watched and optimised from a cardiac perspective.’ It is estimated that more than 16,000 men in this country receive hormone treatment called androgen deprivation therapy, which was the focus of the Harvard University study (Picture posed by model) Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘It is well known that men over 50 are at increased risk of developing prostate cancer. If also overweight, this same group are also at increased risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. ‘We therefore welcome research which looks at taking these other diseases into account when considering prostate cancer treatments. ‘However, although this study suggests a potential link between ADT hormone therapy and increased risk of death in men with an existing heart problem, it does show that the risks are in fact relatively small and that the benefits of taking this for treatment outweigh any possible harmful effects. ‘We would not therefore wish to see men currently on this form of therapy stop their treatment as a result of these findings.’","Some 41,700 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Britain each year .

"Comedian Chris Ramsey lists his top tips for students on surviving Freshers Week . Moving out of home for the first time to go to university is a big leap and there are hundreds of books out there teaching you how to boil an egg or pay a TV licence. But those guides never tell you the REAL need-to-know tips for surviving the first term. Did you know that you will never buy enough loo roll? Or that no one wants to be friends with the person where a university logo sweater? So Femail has enlisted stand-up comedian, Celebrity Juice regular and University Of Sunderland graduate Chris Ramsey to provide the full low-down on getting through Fresher's Week. 1) Plan your living arrangements early… but not too early: . If you're living in dorms for your first year, you will have automatically been allocated a bunch of people to hate the smell of and argue about washing up with for the next year, so don't worry. But when the time comes to get yourself a house, you need to be quick! Make sure you get bunked up with people you like, don't be stuck in a two bedroom below ground floor flat with the guy who breathes loudly at the back of lectures. But for heaven's sake don't ask people about second year housing too early, that's like proposing on the first date; 'Can I borrow a pen please mate?', 'LETS LIVE TOGETHER!' 2) Buy LOTS of toilet roll: . Seriously, you can NEVER have too much bog roll. This will be the first time you have lived on your own. I know the loo roll just magically regenerates in Mummy and Daddy's house, but seriously, it basically evaporates in a shared house… be prepared, no one wants to wipe their a*** on a School Disco Night flyer. 3) Make friends with the guys at the student union: . Yes, this sounds creepy. Yes, some of the people who work there will be about 50 years old. But you can never underestimate the favours that can be pulled by a mate at the student union. Forgot to get tickets to that cool band? Student union mate will help. They are only accepting vouchers for drinks and you lost all of yours? Student union mate will help. Need a body moved? Well… you've gone too far mate. Call your solicitor. Students are warned to avoid microwaving smelly foods and stick to takeaway meals instead . 4) Don't microwave stuff that stinks: . No matter where you are. Just because you are hungry, doesn't mean you need to fumigate the entire house with the smell of your second course leftovers. It's antisocial. If you need to eat in hurry… you know that massive pile of stuff that makes it hard to open your front door? Those are takeaway menus. Use them. 5) Never wear a jumper depicting the university name: . Don't. Just don't. People at Uni will hate you. People outside Uni will hate you. No one is impressed. You are not in American Pie. Stop it. Comedian Chris Ramsey has suggested all students avoid playing extreme frisbee as it is the sport of imbecile . 6) Do not play Extreme Frisbee: . Extreme Frisbee is the sport of the imbecile. It says 'Hey! Are you a bit too clumsy to play football? But not big enough to play rugby? Got no musical talent, or any talent at all to speak of generally? Do you need to get out there and ruin peoples days out in the park? 'Run, fetch, and catch like a big stupid Labrador on a Saturday afternoon with all of your other big stupid Labrador friends… Play Extreme Frisbee. Release your inner big stupid Labrador today' 7) Have stock excuses for being late: . 'Sorry, I missed the bus' is the worst. Don't be that guy. Be the guy who comes in late and spins a yarn Shakespeare himself would be proud of. Or simply confuse the lecturer into submitting. My mate once used the excuse 'Sorry I'm late, I fell over'… it was amazing. The lecturer had never heard something so stupid in her life, therefore, it had to be true. Chris advises that students use normal condoms instead of those that are Freshers-week branded . 8) Use condoms: . This may seem like the most obvious one on this list, but it's not. USE CONDOMS yes, but DO NOT USE the ones they give out on fresher's week. Firstly, it just looks weird. You get that ready for action and you are basically saying 'I've been dying to use this!' But even worse, if you whip that bad boy out in your second year, and blow the dust off it, you're going to look like you were keeping it as a souvenir . 9) Don't be a d***: . As in Uni, as in life.

"With Premier League clubs targeting so many players abroad sometimes it can be hard to keep track of them all. Here, Sportsmail's Adam Crafton explains everything you need to know about Mattia Destro. So, just who is Mattia Destro? Destro is a 23-year-old Italian forward that plays for Roma. He is believed to be on the radar of Tottenham and Chelsea. What would he bring to the team? Pace, power, trickery and goals. Thirteen in twenty appearances for Roma last season, including seven in the final eight games of the season. He was a surprising exclusion from Italy’s World Cup squad.

Spurs scored only 30 goals at White Hart Lane during the last campaign and that record must improve if they are to launch a potent challenge for the top 4. How much would he cost? Roma are prepared to do business but would demand close to £20m for the forward. They have also believed to have approached Chelsea over a loan move for Fernando Torres that could see Destro move to Stamford Bridge as part of the deal. German side Wolfsburg were also interested earlier in the summer. Is there a risk? The player’s wage demands are said to be in the region of £90,000-a-week while he also has a fiery temperament.

"Ann Shoebridge, 66, from Nottingham started online dating five years ago. She has since been targeted by con men eight times . Ann Shoebridge started online dating five years ago after her marriage ended. The 66-year-old from Nottingham signed up to a couple of sites after hearing success stories from friends. But after being on the receiving end of no less than eight attempts at fraud, the retired IT lecturer has almost given up any hope of ever finding another man. Con men have targeted her with a number of creative stories, ranging from their children needing immediate medical treatment, to suggestions that she share the cost of the man's travel expenses to fly to the UK for a date. She said: 'I’ve had a couple of guys that had ‘sick children’ and desperately need an operation in the next few hours, otherwise they’ll die. 'The very first wannabe scammer pretended to have a sick child. 'He very quickly wanted to start chatting on MSN. I guess most of them do actually, because it is away from the dating site. 'I wasn't very experienced on these sites, but I knew it was a scam when he asked for money. 'Plus, his profile picture reminded me of the kind of male models you get on knitting patterns! 'I now respond with, “yes of course I’ll help you, you poor man, give me your phone number,” and then I pass it to an online fraud site.' But it isn't just that she has been lied to, one of the most disheartening aspects is that these ruses often come after Ann has wasted at least eight weeks and a degree of hope on conversations with the man in question. The fraudster can often take months to build up a story that they think is convincing, trying to give off an air of personal wealth before approaching the issue of borrowing money. Scroll down for video . Ann said: 'Then there was one man on match.com who was very good looking and lived fairly local to me, 20 miles away. 'We had been speaking for quite a while before I suggested meeting up for coffee and he said, “I can’t, I have to go to Dubai tomorrow on business.” 'We exchanged numbers and he called me from ‘Dubai’ and I remember thinking that he didn't sound like a white man - like he appeared in his pictures. Fraudsters regularly patrol dating websites, hoping to convince vulnerable and lonely women that they are a trustworthy man who is looking for a relationship . 'He gave me a story about being born in South Africa, then moving to Germany and eventually England, where he had been for 25 years, but he didn’t have an English accent.' Then eventually, the man started to broach the issue of money. Ann said: 'In a conversation quite a few weeks down the line, he told me that it was his birthday soon and he was hoping to buy himself a Rolex, it was a comment designed to make you think that he has a bob or two. 'Then he started asking me what kind of jewelry I wore and he asked me to photograph my hands and send the picture to him. 'He’d apparently been back home but was away again on business, this time in Rome. 'So over a period of eight weeks he was really grooming me. 'Then he mentioned that he really needed £500 to pay his hotel bill. 'I don't have that kind of money to spare, but even if I did there is no way I’d give a complete stranger. People on dating websites are warned never to hand over any financial details to potential suitors . 'I said no, you’re a scammer and he got very uppity and angry. 'Then we talked several weeks later and I asked him if he was Nigerian and he admitted that he was.' But far from being put off by the shame of being caught out, the man was back on the same site within weeks. In another incident, an American serviceman claiming to be in Special Ops said he was working in Iraq, which meant he couldn't access his own money. He asked if Ann could wire him £500 as a loan until he was able to return home. She said: 'I was wary from the moment he said he was in Special Ops, because if that is anything like the SAS, he probably wouldn't have been able to tell me. Ann is trying to remain optimistic, despite several bad experiences . 'I insisted on Skype, so that I could see what he looked like and immediately thought that the place he was in didn't look much like Iraq. 'Then he asked me to send him $500 as he couldn’t access his own money. 'I eventually told him I thought he was a scammer and he was very indignant and started shouting. 'I screen grabbed the messages and reported him to the dating site, but they never came back to me and within a matter of days this man had two more identities. 'He used the same photos, but different names and different locations, places like Wolverhampton.' Ann has never handed over any money, always suspecting foul play. But after being duped several times, the mother-of-two was too disappointed to carry on looking for love any longer. She eventually signed back up after realising that it was one of the best chances she has of finding another man to share her life. She said: 'I am retired and although I’m quite busy with various things during the day, I don’t get the opportunity to go out much at night and how else will I meet a man other than online? 'I’m lonely, I’d like a man in my life but I feel like I’m not going to find one. 'If nothing else, being on these sites gives me hope - I’m a glass half full sort of person and I live in hope. 'I guess I probably never will meet somebody, but if I’m on a dating site then I’m in with a chance, it’s a bit like the lottery.'","Ann Shoebridge, 66, from Nottingham started online dating five years ago .

"Gary Lineker knows a thing or two about scoring, so when he made public his thoughts on Olivier Giroud it was with numbers in mind. ‘Playing in front of Arsenal's midfield,’ he wrote on Twitter. ‘Should guarantee a minimum of 25 goals a season, for a striker of note. Alas....’ The man who won the Golden Boot at the 1986 World Cup believes the silver service laid on by Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere, to name the starters against Besiktas, is of such quality Giroud should top the scoring charts. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsenal's Olivier Giroud puts on one V one masterclass in Austria . Frustrating night: Olivier Giroud reacts after another Arsenal attack breaks down in their 0-0 draw with Besiktas in the Champions League play-off, first leg on Tuesday night . Off the pace: Giroud tries to reach the ball before Besiktas goalkeeper Tolga Zengin in Istanbul . Lack of firepower: Giroud's performance once again underlined Arsene Wenger's need for a striker . Instead he is producing adequate, not impressive, totals and it is a point that goes to the heart of Arsenal’s ambitions for this season and indicates why Arsene Wenger must act again in the transfer market if their title credentials are to avoid falling away like every other recent season. Against Besiktas, Giroud was limp, wasting his team’s best chances to the fury of fans never shy to voice opinions on social media. His Bambi-on-ice attempt at a finish when put in by Sanchez’s delicate dink was illustrative of someone short on confidence but also provided further evidence he lacks that killer instinct possessed by Europe’s elite. That, for a club of Arsenal’s aspirations, is some concern given he is now 27 and in the prime years of his career. Despite standing 6ft 3in tall he is not a striker to bulldoze defences, nor one to race through them either – his pace too limited. Instead he scores his goals through craft and guile, often after smart interchanges with a supporting cast that moves like a carousel. In his first season after his £12million move from Montpellier in 2012 he found the net 11 times in 34 Premier League matches. Last season he scored 16 in 36 Premier League games. Outmuscled: Giroud struggles to reach the ball under pressure from Ersan Gulum and Pedro Franco as Arsenal were held out in Turkey . Lonely job: Giroud was underwhelming as the focal point in Arsenal's attack . Floored: The Frenchman tries to hook the ball in from the ground as defenders and the goalkeeper close in . Giroud's heat map against Besiktas . These are not insubstantial returns for the sum paid but, as Lineker highlighted, when assisted by a midfield of the calibre Wenger has assembled they shrink. Mesut Ozil and Theo Walcott, for example, did not even feature in Turkey. Last season Giroud started well, scoring five goals in his first six games in all competitions for Arsenal, but experienced a barren spell of two goals in 12 games – a brace against Southampton – throughout November and December. Then in February compromising pictures emerged of him enjoying a late-night hotel rendezvous with a woman who was not his wife. He issued an apology to his family and supporters and six goals in 12 Premier League games followed but he did not appear to play with the energy of early season. Hinging too much on that incident would be foolish, though. The deeper worry with Giroud is that he is simply not top level – as his exploits against England’s elite clubs shows. In 23 matches against Manchester City, United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Everton and Tottenham since his arrival at the Emirates, he has scored three goals – two against Spurs and once against Brendan Rodgers’ team. It is a record that should ring alarm bells for Wenger. He must be aware of the need to spend serious money on a central striker who would guarantee goals and actually scare defences at the high end of the league. Giroud does not have that fear factor. Radamel Falcao and Edinson Cavani are two such forwards, available this summer, who would deliver both. Their prices are exorbitant but Wenger has shown with deals for Ozil and Sanchez he will splash the cash on proven talent. If that then means winning the Premier League title the cost would be instantly repaid. Time to splash out: PSG's Edinson Cavani is among the strikers available this summer . For sale: Monaco's Radamel Falcao is another frontman that is up for grabs . Signed: June 2012 for £13million . 2012-13 - Games 47 Goals 17 . 2013-14 - Games 51 Goals 22 . 2014-15 - Games 3 Goals 1 . Total: Games  101 Goals 40 . Giroud averages a goal ever two-and-a-half games for Arsenal . You suspect, though, that Wenger still has not entirely shrugged off his habit for stubborn persistence with budget options – in the belief he can improve players and maintain financial equilibrium among his squad. Giroud firing Arsenal to the title would mean that much more to him personally, however unlikely. It is the same for Yaya Sanogo, the 21-year-old Frenchman bought for nothing last summer. He started against Crystal Palace and was fine but no way near the striker Arsenal need with Champions League and cup runs desired too. Sanogo had a promising pre-season but still has not scored a competitive goal for Arsenal in 15 appearances. Joel Campbell, the Costa Rica striker, has been on the bench and it seems Wenger does not wholly trust him yet. There is little competitive rivalry to spur Giroud on. Drought: Yaya Sanogo hasn't scored for Arsenal in 15 competitive appearances . Waiting: Costa Rican World Cup star Joel Campbell is waiting for a chance in the Premier League . In years gone by Wenger has been able to call on an awesome lineage of scorers; Ian Wright, Dennis Bergkamp, Nicolas Anelka, Thierry Henry, Robin van Persie. These were strikers who would conjure three points with a flick of their boot and win titles. Giroud, sadly, is destined never to be added to that list. Unless Wenger acts, Lineker’s words are set to linger. You can Like our dedicated Arsenal Facebook page here. Loic Remy - QPR striker has seen an £8.5m move to Liverpool fall through this summer but could yet be offloaded to anyone who can meet his wage demands. Scored 14 goals during a loan spell at Newcastle United last season. Edinson Cavani - Wenger is a big admirer of the Paris Saint-Germain striker, who scored 25 times last season, but he certainly wouldn't come cheap.

"Terminally ill star Lynda Bellingham made an emotional return to Loose Women for one final TV appearance, just days before her death. The beloved actress, 66 - who lost her battle with  cancer on Sunday - filmed a special farewell episode of the ITV show, which will air on Wednesday. Lynda - best known for her stint on the series and her longrunning role in the Oxo adverts - received a standing ovation from the audience as she walked out. Brave: Lynda Bellingham filmed one final episode of Loose Women, the show she first joined in 2007, just days before her death . The modest star, who wore a cheerful pink top and had her now purely white hair perfectly coiffed, refused to soak up too much praise, telling the crowd: 'Enough! We've got so much to chat about. 'We haven't time for this! And I do like to chat. Come on girls, ask me, what do you want to know?' She then joined Coleen Nolan and Janet Street Porter on the sofa to discuss her decision to stop undergoing chemotherapy over the summer, a year after she was originally diagnosed with the disease in June 2013. Although Lynda did her best to stay upbeat, Coleen - whose sister Bernie lost her battle with breast cancer last year - broke down in tears as she asked her pal how she'd like to be remembered. Candid: The 66-year-old sat down with Loose Women presenters Janet Street Porter and Coleen Nolan . Heartfelt: Lynda appeared to relish her chance to say goodbye to her legions of Loose Women watching fans . Upbeat: Despite the sadness surrounding her appearance, the actress had the presenters and the audience in stitches . Positive: The star has refused to be downbeat about her diagnosis and is making the most of her final few weeks . Welling up, The Nolans star said: 'How would you... Oh, I'm going to cry... how would you like people to remember you?,' to which Lynda replied: 'Just an honest person.' 'We’ve been through this as Loose Women – you can’t do Loose Women unless you’re honest. 'You can’t hide anything, it really is honest when we answer questions... 'Trust is a huge thing. Not just as an actor, not just as a lover, not just as a wife, that trust thing. Just to say ""you could trust her"".' In on especially moving moment, Lynda reached out to comfort a visibly upset Coleen, telling her: 'Please don’t cry... it will be fine!' Emotional: Coleen struggled to hold back tears as she asked her pal how she would like to be remembered, to which she replied: 'As an honest person' Heartache: Lynda's husband Michael also grew visibly upset as he listened to his wife talk . Among the audience was the actress' husband, Michael, who was also moved to tears by his wife's bravery. Lynda sadly lost her battle with cancer on Sunday, when she passed away in the arms of her beloved husband. The 66-year-old star had been battling colon cancer, which later spread to her lungs and liver, since being diagnosed in July last year. In a statement on behalf of Bellingham's family, her agent, Sue Latimer, said on Monday morning: 'Lynda died peacefully in her husband's arms yesterday at a London hospital. 'Her family would like to thank the nurses and staff for their tremendous care and support. Actor, writer and presenter - to the end Lynda was a consummate professional.' Lynda had previously been candid when it came to her decision to stop having treatment and her positivity while facing the fact she will die in the coming months. She revealed that she wanted to have some control back over the remainder of her life after being left desperately ill by the gruelling chemo sessions. Speaking on ITV's This Morning earlier this month, she explained: 'I just sat down when I was in pain - there's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat, the thrush, plus the fact I'd had major, life-saving surgery for a perforated colon. 'When you're in terrible pain, you make decisions.' Truth: The star has shared her experience in her tell-all new book, There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell You . Looking back: Lynda will also look back at her career, including her 16-year stint as they Oxo mum . The star has also detailed her experiences in moving new book, There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell you. The tome contains goodbye letters to her family. There is a joint message for her sons, Michael, 31, and Robbie, 26, in which she speaks of her regret over the chaotic existence they endured for years due to her violent marriage to their father Nunzio Peluso from 1981 to 1996. She tells them of her sadness that she will not be part of their lives and admits that they might feel ‘cross’ about her stopping treatment. But she adds: ‘If you have a little spirituality in you, believe I will be watching. When the moment comes to say goodbye let’s just hold hands and love each other, as we surely do.’ Lynda previously  insisted she wrote the memoir to take away some of the fear and mystery of her final days: 'My family and I have had lots of chats, time to talk - you realise sometimes when you are a parent you don't ever really talk to your children. 'As a society, we never talk about it, we never face it - even though it's everywhere. We must talk about death. Sit down, get your wills out the way. 'People spend their last few months worrying about death, but not pinpointing [what it is about death] they are worried about - rather than focusing on everything they've got.' Final Farewell: The star's interview will air on ITV on Wednesday . Good pals: Loose Women past and present also returned to support their friend's last appearance .","Actress passed away on Sunday in her husband Michael's arms .

"AC Milan are keen on taking Joel Campbell on loan if negotiations develop with Arsenal over Mario Balotelli. Campbell impressed on loan at Olympiakos and has continued his form with Costa Rica in the World Cup. Milan want Balotelli out and have interest from Monaco but hope Arsenal follow up initial interest and like the idea of a deal for fleet-footed Campbell in the process. VIDEO Scroll down for BELLISSIMO! Balotelli sharp in training and hits great free kick . Deal? AC Milan are keen on taking Arsenal forward Joel Campbell on loan next season if Mario Balotelli goes . Skill school: Arsenal are interested in signing Italy striker Mario Balotelli (left) next season . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was taking a keen interest in Mario Mandzukic's return for Croatia last night but is also among the suitors for Alexis Sanchez of Barcelona. Sanchez has attracted interest from Juventus, Liverpool and Manchester United also but their is a growing belief he fancies a move to Atletico Madrid who made enquiries last week. Barcelona are already losing Victor Valdes, Carles Puyol and Xavi Hernandez while Dani Alves could yet join PSG. They have an interest in Gonzalo Higuain at Napoli but have yet to make a bid. Running riot: Alexis Sanchez (right) starred in their 2-0 Group B win against Spain on Wednesday . Juventus willing to sell Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba . Juventus, as well as wanting Romelu Lukaku, have made a £12million opening bid for Real Madrid's Alvaro Morata in what is seen as a precursor to Arturo Vidal going the other way in a separate deal. Madrid want £25m and a buy-back clause on coveted striker Morata while Juventus are understood to be willing to sell Vidal and Paul Pogba despite protestations that both are key figures at the club. There is no doubt both are influential players but business-savvy Juventus believe this summer may be the best time to cash in on both for optimum price. On the move? Juventus have made a £12million bid for Real Madrid forward Alvaro Morata (left) Vidal was one of Chile's heroes against Spain on Wednesday night and is highly regarded across Europe. Madrid have been asked to stump up £40m for the 27-year-old while Paris St Germain remain firm favourites for Pogba. The former Manchester United midfielder looks more accomplished on every performance and, while there will be clubs here who want to take him, PSG have the resources and players such as Marco Verratti and Lucas Moura to be offered as part of any £50m deal. Morata's departure from Madrid meanwhile will signal their search for another striker. There is little doubt that they will make an attempt to bid for Luis Suarez at Liverpool but they also want a different style of forward who can give them another option from the bench. Double trouble? Juventus are willling to sell Arturo Vidal (left) and Paul Pogba (right) this summer . West Ham offered Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero . West Ham have been offered Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero from Monarcas Morelia but are also considering highly-rated Real Mallorca winger Marco Asensio. The 24-year-old Montero was a target in recent seasons for Wigan, Cardiff and Swansea and his club have had further enquiries from Juventus and Napoli. At £5million he represents good value, however, Asensio is seen as one of the brightest young talents in Spain. International pedidgree: West Ham have been offered Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero (right) Manchester City, Real Madrid and Barcelona have all watched him closely and Mallorca initially signed him ahead of Madrid. The 18-year-old is fast and skilful and has an affordable buy-out clause understood to be around £3m but that is due to more than double next year. The big clubs are maintaining an interest but know they have other wingers who would block his path of progression at this stage. Everton make £8million bid for Croatia's Ivan Perisic . Everton are understood to have placed an £8million bid for Ivan Perisic at Wolfsburg. The Croatian starred again for his national side in their comfortable win over Cameroon on Wednesday night and topped his performance with an impressive goal. That may not help Everton though if Wolfsburg decide to let his performances dictate an auction. They already have interest gathering in Brazilian midfielder Luiz Gustavo and Swiss international left-back Ricardo Rodriguez and their valuations are suitably prohibitive to discourage time wasters. Gustavo has been asked about by Barcelona, United, Arsenal and Chelsea but will cost a minimum £28million and Liverpool target Rodriguez will be £21m as quoted to Fiorentina this week. If that pattern is anything to go by then Everton may find themselves priced out of a deal. Goal: Everton target Ivan Perisic (top) scored for Croatia in their 4-0 World Cup Group A win against Cameroon . Danny Ings off to Germany? Danny Ings is attracting attention from Newcastle and Everton as they consider alternatives to their forward targets. However, the more intriguing interest is coming from the Bundesliga where Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg have taken note of his goalscoring exploits. The 21-year-old has one year left on contract and Burnley insist he will not be sold this summer yet foreign sides recognise he would cost less in compensation if he were to join them and they will be keen observers of his performances in the Premier League next season. Ings was released by Southampton as a teenager but was picked up by Bournemouth before joining Burnley for just over £1m in 2011. He won Championship Player of the Year at Football League awards and scored 26 goals in 45 games last season. Guten tag? Burnley's Danny Ings has attracted interest from German outfits Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg . Crsytal Palace in talks with Chris Kettings . Crystal Palace are discussing a deal for former Blackpool goalkeeper Chris Kettings. The 21-year-old free agent started his career at Manchester City before joining Blackpool in 2007 and had subsequent loan spells at Birmingham, Morecambe and York City. He will provide cover for Julian Speroni and Wayne Hennessey. Safe hands: Crystal Palace are in talks to sign former Blackpool goalkeeper Chris Kettings as their third-choice . Stoke offered Livorno striker Paulinho . Stoke have been offered 28-year-old Livorno striker Paulinho. Brazilian-born but with an Italian passport, Livorno president Aldo Spinelli said: 'I can confirm a proposal from Al Jazira. They made a very serious offer and we're talking about it to see if we can find an agreement.' Talking to Gazzetta dello Sport, he added: 'What I can say is that the negotiations have started and in the coming hours we will know more about this, with everything still open, and talk to the player to work out the best opportunity. Al Jazira have already spoken with Paulinho, but Stoke City also want him and there are also a couple of other English clubs.' The 28-year-old impressed in Serie A last season and scored 15 times in 35 games, also providing six assists for his team-mates, yet Stoke ideally want younger players and maintain an interest in signing 18-year-old Barcelona winger Adama Traore on loan. Potent: Livorno striker Paulinho scored 15 times in 35 Serie A games for the club last season . PSG admit defeat in Eden Hazard pursuit . Laurent Blanc has seemingly conceded defeat in his efforts to prise Eden Hazard from Chelsea. French champions PSG were poised to offer £61m for the former Lille playmaker but Jose Mourinho insisted they would be wasting their time and has signalled discussions over a new contract for the Belgian. Blanc said: 'Hazard is a top player, but I think Chelsea want to keep him. A lot of players are going to be mentioned, but we have already got our priority, David Luiz.' No go: PSG boss Laurent Blanc admits it will be unlikely Belgium's Eden Hazard (bottom) will leave Chelsea . Doncaster's Chris Brown in Blackpool move? Incoming joint-Doncaster owner John Ryan says forward Chris Brown has been offered a deal to sign for Blackburn. The 29-year-old striker has been with Doncaster since 2011 and scored nine goals in 43 appearances last season. Lucrative deal: Doncaster face a battle to hold onto Chris Brown who was offered a better wage at Blackburn . Ryan said: 'We have unfortunately lost (Mark) Duffy and Chris Brown as they had to take a 50 per cent wage cut. 'Chris Brown has been offered 10 grand a week by Blackburn, you can't compete with that.'","AC Milan are keen on taking Joel Campbell on loan if Arsenal develop their interest in Mario Balotelli .

"Ellie Topliff turns two in February and sadly it will probably be her last birthday. The tiny tot is one of only two Australians known to have Tay Sachs disease, a genetic disorder caused by the absence of an enzyme that breaks down fatty substances in the brain. As a result of the missing protein, fat builds up in the brain leading to blindness, hearing loss, seizures, paralysis and eventually death. The tragic news is that there is no treatment and a cure is yet to be found. Despite her ongoing battle with Tay Sachs disease, Ellie Topliff (pictured) continues to smile . Ellie's mum Catherine (pictured left) says she and her husband Joel (pictured right) began to see signs of a problem when Ellie (pictured middle) was about seven-months-old . Between 1995 and 2011 there were 12 recorded cases of Tay Sachs in Australia. Ellie (pictured) is now blind and requires a feeding tube . That means one child in every 353,935 is born with the condition. The disease is usually diagnosed when a baby is six-months-old, when development slows then regresses as fatty substances begin to envelop the brain. Ellie's mum Catherine says she and her husband Joel began to see signs of a problem when Ellie was about seven-months-old. 'Ellie was always the fastest to develop from early on. There was a group of six of us who had babies about 10 days apart and she would always succeed in her milestones before them,' she told AAP. 'Around seven or eight months she stopped rolling, so I said `okay she is getting ready to crawl' but then she never did.' 'And then we were waiting and waiting and waiting.' After visiting their local GP in Noosa, Queensland, Ellie was referred to a pediatrician in Nambour who immediately organised an ambulance and overnight stay at Brisbane's Royal Children's Hospital. It was there that an ophthalmologist spotted a cherry-red spot on Ellie's retina at the back of her eye and that's when alarm bells started to ring clear. As the family returned to their Noosa Heads home to celebrate Ellie's first birthday, the team of doctors confirmed their suspicions. Ellie had Tay Sachs disease. The tiny tot is one of only two Australians known to have Tay Sachs disease, a genetic disorder caused by the absence of an enzyme that breaks down fatty substances in the brain . Ellie and her parents : 'It felt like my whole world just stopped in that moment. My heart was absolutely broken,' Ms Topliff recalls the moment she and her husband received the news . Ellie grandmother is currently riding from Victoria to Queensland to raise funds for her treatment although at this stage there is no treatment and cure for the disease . 'It felt like my whole world just stopped in that moment. My heart was absolutely broken,' Ms Topliff recalls the moment she and her husband received the news. 'We were thinking worst-case scenarios and in the back of my mind the worst case scenario was that she was that sick and she would die.' 'But I never actually thought the worst-case scenario would happen.' Now Ellie is blind and she requires specialist equipment including a feeding tube, yet despite her ongoing battle with the disease, the little girl continues to smile. 'She has always being a very happy little girl. Always loved the water, I think she feels very relaxed and free so she is always giggling when she is in water,' she said. 'She absolutely loves music. Her dad sings to her every night and she's always singing.' It's her seven-week-old brother Flynn who makes her smile the most. 'Whenever he is near her she seems to sense that he's there.' 'She has always being a very happy little girl,' said Ellie's mum despite her condition . Ellie (pictured) is one of only two Australians know to have Tay Sachs disease which is a deadly genetic disorder which has already seen the tiny tot go blind and require a feeding tube . Despite her ongoing battle with Tay Sachs disease, Ellie Topliff (pictured) continues to smile . For now the Topliff family celebrate each month of Ellie's life like a birthday.The next one is her 21st. 'We're going to invite friends and family and will have the 21st key.' 'We've got to make the most of every month,' Ms Topliff says. To raise funds for Ellie's treatment, her grandmother is currently on a ride from Stanhope, Victoria to Tewantin RSL in Queensland.

"The inventor of beloved board game Operation has found himself in the hands of adoring fans as they try to raise thousands for surgery which he desperately needs and cannot afford. John Spinello, 77, invented the board game in 1964 and sold the rights to toy designer Marvin Glass for just $500 and the promise of a job when he graduated from the University of Illinois. The job never materialized but the young man did finally receive a check for $500. The rights to the game were sold on to Milton Bradley board game company which produced the first version of Operation in 1965. Now owned by Hasbro, Operation has made $40million for its owners. With none of that money ever making its way to Mr Spinello, he now finds himself in need of $25,000 for oral surgery after the collapse of his own small business several years ago left him without sufficient health insurance. Scroll down for videos . John Spinello, 77, invented the board game Operation which has delighted children for generations. Mr Spinello only made $500 selling the rights to the game - but now needs $25,000 for oral surgery . Mr Spinello, of Illinois, pictured with his wife Madeline in their Operation board game t-shirts - part of a wealth of memorabilia which has grown up around the phenomenon . Fans of Operation have now stepped in to help Mr Spinello by setting up a fundraising page for his surgery on Crowdrise.com and on another site, Iloveoperation.com, where Mr Spinello is signing copies of the board game. Mr Spinello, who used to run a warehouse business which went bust during the economic collapse in 2008, said he has no bitterness about not making more money out of his clever idea. Mr Spinello, who lives in Bloomington with his wife Madeline, said: 'Look, everyone needs medical care. John Spinello, pictured in the 1970s, after he gave up the rights to his million-dollar idea, Operation . The board game Operation tests players' handiwork with a tiny set of tweezers as they tried to pinch out 'Cavity Sam's' organs without setting off the dreaded buzzer. The body parts have comic names such as 'Bread Basket', 'Writer's Cramp' and 'Funny Bone'. In 2004, 'Brain Freeze' was added after the company ran a competition. While the inventor, John Spinello, took home $500 in 1964 for his clever idea, toy firms  Milton Bradley and then Hasbro, have made around $40million from the franchise. The game has taken on multiple guises: in 2002, there was a brain surgery-version which focused on pulling pieces from Cavity Sam's head. In 2004, a Shrek  game was released and in 2005, a Simpsons version with Homer on the operating table instead of Sam. HIs trademark 'D'oh!' replaced the familiar 'bzzzt!' The franchise also rolled out Spider-Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, SpongeBob SquarePants, Toy Story and Despicable Me 2 versions. The most recent Operation was a Planes: Fire & Rescue version this year. 'I prefer not to dwell on that aspect and focus more on the joy that the game has brought to so many over the years.' Mr Spinello also plans to auction the prototype of his game which he came up with for a class when he was an industrial design student at the University of Illinois. The inventor hopes to raise close to $35,000 on eBay from the original metal box with carvings, holes and a wand. The aim of Operation was to test hand-to-eye coordination with players acting as'doctor' and inserting metal tweezers into holes on the body of 'Cavity Sam' on the board. Players tried to remove Sam's organs without touching the edges and setting off the buzzer. The winner at the end of the game was the player who had racked up the most money by carefully grabbing items such as Adam's Apple, Wrenched Ankle, Butterflies in Stomach and Spare Ribs. The campaign to pay for Mr Spinello's surgery was started by fans and fellow inventors, Tim Walsh and Peggy Brown. By Wednesday afternoon, funds had reached more than $18,000. Those donating left messages for Mr Spinello, including: 'Thanks for the fun, Mr Spinello', 'A grateful kid from the 60s' and 'bzzzt!' Others have written detailed letters to the inventor, telling him the effect that Operation had on their childhood and some offering condolences that he had not made money out of the classic game. One father wrote: 'Thanks for a great lifetime of Operation. My sister and I played together 40 some years ago and my girls play it together now. In fact, there is a game somewhere in our playroom right now. 'I have to admit, the buzzer was a lot less annoying 40 years ago! Thanks for the memories.' One Australian fan said: 'I hope you raise enough to not only help you to afford your surgery but hopefully a lot more to help you live a more fullfilling lifestyle as you deserve.' Another added: 'Dear John, I am 58 yrs. old and remember, vividly, playing Operation with my brother and friends! 'Perhaps that’s what lead me to become a Certified Oral Surgery Assistant and later a Registered Nurse!? Thanks for the fun!'' Hasbro told MailOnline on Wednesday that the company planned to buy Mr Spinello's prototype in the hope of helping with his medical costs. Julie Duffy, Vice President of Global Communications, said in a statement: 'We were moved to see the recent outpouring of support from so many fans of the Operation game around the world regarding the medical needs of the game’s original inventor, John Spinello. 'The Operation game has been a family favorite for 50 years and while we didn’t buy the game from Mr Spinello directly, his invention is an important part of Hasbro’s history. Mr Spinello recently announced his plans to put up for auction the original Operation game prototype that he designed in the early 1960’s. 'Today we informed Mr. Spinello that Hasbro plans to purchase the prototype with the hope that the funds will help to defray his medical costs. We plan to proudly display it at Hasbro’s global headquarters in Pawtucket, RI to honor his contribution to Hasbro’s gaming history.'

"Kenwyne Jones scored the first goal of the new Football League season as Blackburn Rovers and Cardiff City served up a Friday night appetiser that augurs well for the next nine months. Jones, who had failed to score in 10 games as Cardiff slipped out of the Premier League last season, showed the Sky Bet Championship should be more to his liking when he was given time and space to put away an 18th minute header.

Taking his chance: Jones pwoers a header past Paul Robinson to put Cardiff 1-0 up . Emphatic style: The former Stoke striker celebrated with an acrobatic flip in front of his team-mates . Blackburn: Robinson 7, Lowe 6, Hanley 6, Kilgallon 6 (Williamson 45 6), Baptiste 6, Olsson 7, Evans 6, Cairney 7, Conway 8, Rhodes 6, Gestede 6 . Goal: Cairney 40 . Booked: Lowe .

Booked: Brayford, Hudson, Burgstaller. Subs not used: John, Kim, Theophile-Catherine, Moore . Manager: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 6 . Referee: Andrew Madley (West Yorkshire) 7 . Attendance: 15,625. Though the quality wasn’t World Cup-standard – Cairney’s swerving strike excepted - there was enough commitment and attacking ambition to make the 15,000 fans inside Ewood Park glad that competitive domestic football is back. With the pressure on Solskjaer after relegation, he was the happier manager even though his side were left hanging on for periods of the second half. ‘We proved we’ve got the characters to deal with these games,’ he said. ‘We’ve gone away from home and dug out a result, I thought our attitude was spot-on. We could have gone gung-ho but didn’t, and earned a point that may be important in May. ‘We’ve got players like Mark Hudson who enjoy defending, they like heading the ball away.’ Cardiff have already lost Fraizer Campbell, Steven Caulker and Jordon Mutch this summer with Chile World Cup star Gary Medel absent on Friday ahead of an expected £8million move to Inter Milan. They did receive an early stroke of luck after 70 seconds when referee Andrew Madley gave Rovers a free-kick instead of a penalty after Hudson had handled inside the box. But the visitors took advantage of their good fortune when Hudson flicked on a Whittingham free-kick after 18 minutes and Jones headed in only his second goal since joining the club from Stoke in January. Technique: Tom Cairney levelled the scores for Blackburn with a well-taken strike from long range . Proving a point: Blackburn midfielder Tom Cairney is mobbed by his team-mates after his first-half finish . Fiery encounter: The opening match of the Championship season had its fair share of meaty challenges . The big Trinidadian, who missed the start of pre-season to deal with a family issue back home, celebrated with his trademark backflip and Solskjaer knows he will need him firing this season. ‘Kenwyne has worked really hard. He came in a few weeks late because he’s had personal challenges but really come on,’ said the Norwegian manager. To Blackburn’s credit, they bounced back well after falling behind. Their reward arrived after 40 minutes when Rhodes, not renowned for his tigerish tackling, caught Whittingham napping and Cairney crashed home the loose ball with a left-foot finish that swerved away from David Marshall. The second half was largely Rovers and their manager Gary Bowyer claimed: ‘I thought we deserved a bit more from the game. ‘We had a lot of the ball against a team that has just come down from the Premier League and scored an outstanding goal. The lad (Cairney) is a great technician and has a fantastic left foot.’ Let the games begin: Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, left, and Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer, right . Different league: Solskjaer oversaw a 1-1 draw in his first Sky Bet Championship match against Blackburn . Rudy Gestede, one of two former Cardiff players in the Rovers line-up along with the impressive Craig Conway, had Blackburn’s best chances but miscued with an overhead kick and then sent a header over with Marshall stranded. On the downside, a back injury to Matt Kilgallon leaves Bowyer short of bodies at the back. ‘I’ll need to have a word with the people upstairs,’ he said. Solskjaer has already done the majority of his transfer business but will need an extra defender when Medel leaves. Only one of his six summer recruits, forward Adam Le Fondre, started on Friday night. The man dubbed the baby-face assassin at Manchester United knows his team will have to be tough this season. He was secretly pleased by one robust tackle made in the second half by the normally-silky Whittingham. ""Proper"" football is back.

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff is confident the simmering rivalry between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will not boil over and has revealed the pair may be allowed to duel for the Formula One title. German Rosberg leads the drivers' standings on 202 points, with Briton Hamilton 11 points behind and their nearest rival Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) a further 60 points adrift. Mercedes have won nine of the 11 grands prix this season and it appears Rosberg and Hamilton, whose relationship has been frosty of late, are in pole position for the title. Rivals: Mercedes boss Toto Wolff is confident that the battle to win the Formula One title between Nico Rosberg (left) and Lewis Hamilton (right) will not get out of hand . Wolff told formula1.com: 'Yes, potentially it is going to get more heated, but if we carry on in performing as we do now I am still carefully optimistic that it is only up to the two of them in fighting for the world championship. 'Then we get to a situation where we could discuss if we want to maintain the way we work with each other. 'Do we think it is beneficial for the car, the team, and both sides of the garage? Or do we want to recalibrate a little bit, because it is about the two of them and one remaining world championship? 'That is a question mark - I don't know, because I haven't been there yet. It is new ground. 'For the drivers, it is about the drivers' world championship, but nevertheless you have to understand that there is a big organisation behind them - one of the biggest and most well-known brands in the world - and sometimes the team comes first. That is clear and both of them acknowledge and accept that.' The relationship between the drivers was subject to scrutiny when Hamilton refused to allow Rosberg to pass during the Hungarian Grand Prix last month, acting against team orders. Boost: Wolff (left), pictured here with Niki Lauda, believes Rosberg and Hamilton have pushed each other on . Wolff believes the pair's relationship is good for the team. 'Until now it has functioned really well,' Wolff added. 'Could it come to a point where we say it is difficult to manage? It could be, but I don't see it - not with the two of them. 'They push each other to new levels, to new heights, in a way that is not detrimental to the team. 'It can get quite messy, and we have seen that at other teams. To this point it has been very beneficial for the team. 'We are in good spirits here, we have a good atmosphere, and having two drivers on that level, racing each other like they do, is not only good for the brand but also for performance overall.

"Market towns could be forced to grow by up to three times to accommodate ‘huge slabs’ of housing, according to the chief executive of English Heritage. Simon Thurley, who has been at the head of the organisation for 12 years, made the warning following David Cameron’s conference speech earlier this week. He claimed that by the next election, market towns may become sprawling and sacrifice their historic beauty in order to accommodate more houses. Scroll down for video . Simon Thurley (above), chief executive of English Heritage, has claimed market towns could be forced to triple in size to accommodate ‘huge slabs’ of housing as the government desperately tries to solve the housing crisis . ‘If we think there has been a pressure to build houses already, we have seen nothing yet,’ he said. Mr Thurley said that, any party which came into power, would be forced to ‘put its foot on the accelerator’ using ‘draconian measures’ to expand towns in line with the current housing crisis. The comments came at the Henley Literary Festival - supported by the Daily Mail - yesterday during a talk which he gave about his new book: The Building of England. He described the ‘huge identical slabs of housing’ as ‘the biggest and most worrying threat’ faced by Britain. Instead of developing towns such as Chichester, Dorchester and Henley, Mr Thurley suggested that spaces above shops should be turned into home and that land occupied by car parks re-used to create new homes.

"The ObamaCare website is 'easy' to hack, critics say, and has become the focus of security concerns as the second year of enrolment approaches. The healthcare site is one of the largest federal collections of personal information ever assembled in the U.S., containing the first and last names, home address, social security number and payment information - including credit card data - of people who enrol. President Barack Obama's ObamaCare website is 'easy' to hack, say critics who are drawing attention to data security concerns as the second year of enrolment approaches . The website was hacked on July 8, but the security breach wasn't spotted until August 25 . Lamar Smith, chair of a congressional committee looking after the security of the website, said there had been hearings on the 'lack of security' around the website. He told Fox News: 'What we've discovered is that it seems to be easy to be hacked, the security is not secure.' For example, the website was hacked on July 8 but the security breach wasn't discovered until August 25. Last month, a Government Accountability Office report said, 'Until these weaknesses are fully addressed, increased and unnecessary risks remain.' But officials say they have met 19 of 22 GAO recommendations. The healthcare website is one of the largest federal collection of personal information ever assembled and requires those enrolling o supply their first and last name, home address, social security number and payment information - including credit card data . One security specialist, David Kennedy, warned that hacking cases had risen 400 per cent this year, saying 'it's a mess out there right now'. Congressman Smith had concerns last fall, but the former chief technology officer to the president, Todd Park, testified last November that he knew nothing about security problems. Mr Smith contends that problems were known but ignored, and is issuing a subpoena to force Mr Park to testify again. There is no law that requires the federal government to notify anyone that their personal information has been hacked. About 20 million Americans have gained medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare, since it was signed into law in 2010. The law was designed to make health insurance simpler and more available to Americans, but critics have lambasted it as a waste of money.","Government Accountability Office has identified security 'weaknesses'

"This is the dramatic moment that a British fugitive wanted in Belgium for alleged drug smuggling and money laundering for a Hells Angels gang is arrested by armed police in Spain. A video filmed from a chest-cam shows one of the officers running down a street, his semi-automatic handgun outstretched as Conrad Toland is pinned to a pavement outside a restaurant in Madrid by two Civil Guard officers, with one jamming a gun into the back of his neck. He shouts 'don't move, if you move...' as he approaches. Scroll down for video . This is the dramatic moment that a British fugitive wanted in Belgium for alleged drug smuggling and money laundering for a Hells Angels gang is arrested by armed police in Spain . The video, released by Spanish police, begins with an armed officer running down the street towards Conrad Toland . As two armed Civil Guard officers pin Toland to the ground - with one jamming a gun in his neck - the officer videoing the take-down points his gun at the wanted man and warns him not to move . Toland had been evading the Spanish authorities since July 2013. The 47-year-old Brit is described by the Civil Guard as the ringleader of a gang that smuggled 155kilos of cocaine from Ecuador to Belgium and allegedly supplied coke to a Hells Angels chapter in Bruges. He is also accused of belonging to an armed gang by the Belgian authorities. Toland has been brought before the National Court in Madrid to face extradition proceedings to Belgium . Hells Angels are a fairly recent addition to Belgium, with the first chapter founded in 1997 in Gentbrugge. The motorcycle gang can now be found in seven other places including Antwerp, Charleroi City, Genk and Tongeren. The Hells Angels MC Belgium website declares: 'They branded us as outlaws. We know, as you, only outlaws can be free.' Controversy has swirled around the group in Belgium for a number of years, with police linking it with the shooting of three members of another motorcycle gang, the Outlaws, in 2009. Police say that the Hells Angels are active in firearms and drug trafficking. The first Hells Angels club was founded in 1948 in California. Tracked down to a location in Malaga province Toland managed to dodge the Civil Guard anti-fugitive team. But the alleged gang chief was nabbed as he left the Madrid flat of a girlfriend that had been under surveillance for months on October 13. He has been brought before the National Court in Madrid to face extradition proceedings to Belgium. The arrest was made by the same team that arrested Briton Trevor Moore, 45, on the Costa del Sol in January. Civil Guard officers said in a statement that Moore was the Toland's right-hand man. Moore, who previously lived in Belgium, is alleged to have taken delivery of 'large quantities' of cocaine from Ecuador. Andrew Venables, a gun expert who runs WMS Firearms Training in Ffair Rhos, Ceredigion, west Wales, said today that the policemen were covert officers carrying Sig P-224 handguns. He told MailOnline: 'I was very impressed with the video - they did a very professional job.'

Allardyce had sympathy for his striker after his latest setback, admitting such time on the sidelines is a lonely time for any footballer. Keeping fit: Allardyce said: 'I've seen pictures of Andy in the gym she [Mucklow] has' He added: 'For a player the big problem is sitting with a boot on and getting past the time and the boredom. There has to be some release from that - but make sure it's the right release, not the wrong one. 'I don't think people realise just how depressing it can be for a player. And of course you may well see Andy on social media now, you'll see him with his high-profile girlfriend, seeming like he's enjoying himself which he probably is at the time but deep down inside it's a long, lonely way back for him.

Bundamba Auto Wreckers in Ipswich, south-east Queensland, has morphed a Holden Commodore and a Ford Falcon together to create a car lover's dream - the 'Falcodore' The challenge came about when owner Dean Hawkins was approached by breakfast radio hosts Mike Bryne and Marie T from the local station River 94.9 - they couldn't decide which one to purchase .

'Marie's partner was looking at buying a new vehicle but he couldn't decide between a Ford Falcon or a Holden Commodore - they asked me what I thought and if we could put the two together,' Mr Hawkins told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Hawkins, a self confessed Holden lover, said the challenge was sure to be hard but he was ready to take it on. 'We made a plan on how we were going to do it, made a schedule and away we went.'

'Others have cut cars  and just attached the front and back of two different vehicles but we actually got the two cars and cut them down the middle. 'We worked out how to cut them, got it wielded, got the  paint and added the stickers.' The red and blue Falcodore is literally half Ford and Holden, with an engine made from a Ford Falcon motor, a Holden gear box and a Falcon diff.

"Survey finds that 55 per cent of us have a pet name for our other hald, but 'darling' is the more common name in the south . 'Darling' is the most common term of affection between British couples - but where you live affects your cheeky pet names, a new YouGov poll has revealed. In total, 55 per cent of UK adults have a pet name for a loved one - with two thirds happy to say out out loud in front of friends and family. But while people in London and the south of England were more likely to use 'darling', 'love' was the favoured term of affection in the North of England and Wales. 'Ducky' was most popular across the Midlands (10 per cent, compared to 3 per cent UK-wide), while 'sweetheart' was most commonly used in the East of England (30 per cent). Singles in the Tyne & Wear area were the most likely to use 'pet' (17 per cent), while 22 per cent of Mancunians favour 'sexy'. In Yorkshire, 'Love' is the favoured term of endearment, used by 31 per cent; while in Glasgow or Edinburgh you're most likely to call your loved one 'honey' or 'hun' (used by 28 per cent.) In Merseyside, Scousers are more likely to use 'babe' or 'babes' (35 per cent); and the nickname 'baby' is most commonly used in Wales (29 per cent). A surprisingly large number of men - 15 per cent - admit referring to their loved one as 'the boss', whilst 'her indoors' (9 per cent) and 'the ball and chain' (3 per cent) were also popular. Some were more forgiving, with 14 per cent opting for 'my better half', the YouGov survey for Match.com of over 4,000 people found. Females were more mild-mannered, opting for 'the hubby' (20 per cent), 'husband' (51 per cent) or 'partner' (28 per cent). Match.com's relationship expert Kate Taylor said: 'Pet names play an important role at every stage of relationships. 'Before a couple get together, they often use fun, flirty nicknames for each other to move ahead to a more personal level of interaction. It creates a tiny shared bond. 'When dating, pet names are used to reinforce a couple's bond, both privately and to the outside world, whilst in long-term relationships, ""love"" or ""pet"" can become simple shorthand for, ""I care about you."" Affectionate couples in the north refer to each other as 'love', while Ducky was popular in the Midlands and sweetheart came to in the east . 'Pet names are an effective way of adding romance to everyday communications. 'The success of email-based dating websites shows us how important words are for fostering relationships, so use them!' The research also found that single, online daters will use pet names when they start communicating with someone through a mobile dating app. The most popular pet name to use when singles first start chatting is 'hun' or 'honey' (28 per cent) followed by 'Babe' (26 per cent), whilst 21 per cent use the term 'darling'.","'Darling' most popular name in UK and favourite of those living in the south .

"Nathan Tinkler will see the majority of his property and racing empire dismantled this week in the country's largest horse sale. The coal investor is reportedly over $40 million in debt to Magic Millions boss Gerry Harvey, who initiated the dispersal sale of Mr Tinkler's Patinack Farm property at his Gold Coast sale yard on Sunday. The sale will end Mr Tinkler's foray into horse breeding and racing, but will hopefully pave the way towards financial stability, with the first day at auction seeing over $21 million in sales. The auction was the first of four organised by Mr Harvey for the 447-hectare Patinack Farm property in Beaudesert, Queensland, and includes more than 500 breeding and racing thoroughbreds. The property will be available in quarter portions, comprising Wadham Park, Elysium Fields, Sarahvale and Benoble estates. Mr Tinkler invested a staggering $300 million into the property, which took six years to build, before Patinack Farm was sequestered by Mr Harvey in August.

There were high hopes for the sale, with expectations of at least one thoroughbred going under the hammer for $1 million.

"Cancer survivor Joe Thompson has slammed Tranmere for not renewing his contract after battling back from the life-threatening disease. The 25-year-old was diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin’s lymphoma last October, but was given the all-clear in June after completing a course of chemotherapy. Thompson’s contract at Prenton Park expired this summer and he was full of anticipation of a fresh deal being offered and reviving his career. Tranmere exit: Midfielder Joe Thompson, pictured with Ian Goodison, left the club in the summer . Former side: Thompson ended his two-year affiliation with Tranmere in the summer . However, the former Rochdale trainee claims he was astonished no one from the club contacted to negotiate a new contract. 'I’ve not spoken to any of the decision makers from Tranmere,' said Thompson. 'I’ve just spoken to one or two members of the coaching staff. 'The medical team from the club have been in touch with my doctors throughout my recovery process to check how I’m doing, but I’ve not had a call from the manager, the chief executive or anything like that. 'I’m disappointed that they have not contacted me or offered me anything. I thought morally, that something would have been done. 'Even a short-term deal for like three months or something, but it's football, and you have to move on. 'The Tranmere fans were brilliant, top class – they helped me massively through it all. They gave me loads of support and sent gifts to the club and got involved with my campaign. 'Together we raised over £20,000 for cancer research and I will never forget that they were there during my lowest moments. 'The club will probably say they paid me in full for a year, when I was of no use to them. But it still leaves a bad taste that I have not had a call from anyone. I feel sad but football and life moves on. I have no enemies at Tranmere, I made good friends there.' Team effort: Thompson is grateful to his former side for helping him raise over £20,000 for cancer research . Grateful: Thompson was delighted with the way he was treated at Tranmere Rovers . Moving on: Thompson is looking forward to playing under Flitcroft at Bury . Thompson announced on his Twitter account over the weekend that he had signed for League Two rivals Bury after taking part in their pre-season training camp in the Canary Islands. Shakers manager, Dave Flitcroft, was sufficiently impressed with his displays to offer the wide man a pay-as-you-play deal. He added: 'I was in Tenerife for eight days with the guys doing pre-season training. 'It was tough; we were doing three sessions a day. But I felt good, the power is coming back. 'The Bury manager is my old assistant manager from Rochdale and knows me from there. He’s very ambitious, and wants to go for it and get promoted this year. He wants to play attacking football and I just thought ""I want to be part of that"". 'I can’t thank him and the chairman Stewart Day enough for giving me this opportunity to get my life back on track. 'The PFA have been a massive help during this ordeal - John Bramhall in particular. I can’t thank him enough. As has my agent Gary Lloyd, his support has been constant during this nightmare year. Tranmere did say they would speak to the PFA but they haven’t. 'There loss is Bury’s gain. Life moves on. I couldn’t sit on the sofa waiting for a call that might not have come. I had to do what’s best for me and my family.' Good deal: Bury boss Flitcroft will be delighted with the signing of midfielder Thompson . Tranmere, though, insists they have not been given the opportunity to discuss fresh terms with Thompson and that they have been nothing but supportive through the process, and hinted the delay in sorting a new contract is not their doing. Speaking last week before their friendly with Everton, Rovers manager Rob Edwards said: 'I have spoken to the chief executive about the current situation with Joe. 'We are still waiting for the PFA to come back to us about a meeting we have requested that includes Joe, his agent and the PFA to talk about Joe’s future. 'Once we have the meeting we can move forward, but we want to do everything correctly and professionally. 'In the meantime we have offered Joe the opportunity to carry out his rehab with us.'","Tranmere failed to offer Joe Thompson a new deal before his departure .

"In hindsight, we should have seen it coming. Everything was going far too well. This is a club, in my lifetime and before, that has perennially shot itself in the foot. Tony Pulis' departure is one that is already leaving us Palace fans wondering 'what if' - and the season hasn't even started yet. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger discuss shock at the departure of Tony Pulis . Gone: Tony Pulis has left Crystal Palace on the eve of the new Premier League season . Here we go again: Palace fans are dismayed to see Pullis leave after he ensured their safety last season . Yet, the circumstances, though played out on a bigger stage and with different variables, are not too dissimilar to when Dougie Freedman left for Bolton nearly two years ago . The board then were unwilling to give in to Freedman's demands of a bigger and longer contract as a reward for his success, and off he went to Bolton. Similarly, Pulis' demands - for the club to spend big on Steven Caulker, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Michu - have not been met and he too is hot-footing out of SE25. Now, it must be said that an 11th-placed finish in the Premier League should give a manager a far stronger mandate to get what he wants than merely a strong start to the season in the Championship, but the under-lying principles remain the same. CPFC 2010, the consortium of Palace fans which saved the club from extinction just four years ago, have a clear vision. To rebuild Palace's infrastructure, which had fallen far behind the requirements of a Championship club, let alone a top flight club, is a vital and ongoing process, and one that must run parallel with, and not be overtaken by, spending on the playing staff. Managers, by their nature, will often only see the short-term picture - namely, results. Breaking up is hard to do: Pulis (left) was appointed by Steve Parish (right) but has now left the club . Pulis was achieving an A+ in that regard, but for a club whose top earner was on £10,000-a-week when promoted just 15 months ago, to already be forking out sums of £10million and wages nearing £50,000 would be foolhardy. Yet that is what Pulis wanted, and you can't blame him. A manager is always going to fight his corner. It just so happened that his unstoppable force met an immovable object in co-chairman Steve Parish. The fractures in the relationship between the two were there from day one, in fact, they were there before then. At Pulis' unveiling the pair admitted negotiations to bring him in had been troublesome and lengthy. Looking back now, it is clear to see why. Pulis was never Parish's sort of manager, an old-school, finger-in-every-pie boss. Equally, Parish was not Pulis' sort of chairman. He wants every decision run by him and the appointment of Iain Moody as sporting director - effectively a middle man between the two - illustrates that. There were further differences of opinion as the season went on too, but the cracks were papered over. Target: Michu, who joined Napoli, was one of the players Pulis wanted but was not able to approach . It always felt like a short-term fix when Pulis came in, a manager keen to rebuild his reputation and a club desperate to stay in the top flight meeting for a brief romance, not a long-term marriage. The fundamental differences were always going to come to a head, even if no-one saw it happening this quickly. In many ways, the board went against their beliefs, their mantra, in hiring Pulis. As baffling as Parish's stance may seem to some, it makes sense from a business stance - and a business is, effectively, what he is helping run. Palace were the eighth-best team in the division counting only results from when Pulis took over in November. No key players left in the summer, so why fork out tens of millions when the ambitious manager may well leave at the first sniff of an opportunity higher up the table? Rome wasn't built in a day, and all that. Back in the day: Pulis masterminded Palace's remarkable comeback against Liverpool last season . For all his popularity, and Pulis will go into Palace folklore for what he achieved in his nine months in charge, the continued side-lining of academy starlet Jonny Williams and record signing Dwight Gayle, and the reluctance to bring back Wilfried Zaha from his Old Trafford wilderness, did not sit well with many Palace fans. It seems likely that whoever comes in will be expected to use Williams and Gayle, and perhaps have Zaha to work with too. Whether that trio can make up for the loss of such a talismanic figure in Pulis, only time will tell. But come what may, life goes on in SE25, as it did when Freedman left and, just, when CPFC 2010 saved the club. Of course, this an eternally optimistic viewpoint, but that's what Palace fans are, it's in the fabric of the club and what has kept it going through the dark days, and will do when the season kicks off on Saturday at the Emirates and beyond.

"Paul Gascoigne has been admitted to hospital following an apparent drinking binge. The England legend, who made 57 appearances for his country, was found slumped outside his penthouse apartment in Poole, Dorset, clutching a bottle of gin.

But the reality is Paul has been drinking for the past few weeks and once that happens things will only end one way. ‘Today things came to a head. He has had a lot on his plate as he is in the process of trying to find somewhere to live. ‘His landlord had given him 10 days to get out of the flat and it was weighing on his mind.

"A mother has bought the village post office where her daughter was bludgeoned to death by her husband. Agnes Gaylor, 64, has bought the Village Shop and Post Office in Melsonby, North Yorkshire, from relatives of her former son in law, Robin Garbutt, who is currently serving life in prison for murdering her daughter, Diana Garbutt, in 2010. Mrs Gaylor, who is thought to have paid around £130,000 for the end-of-terrace building, has said she intends to finish off work on the kitchen that was started by her daughter before her death. Agnes Gaylor has bought the post office in Melsonby, North Yorkshire, where her daughter was murdered . Robin Garbutt, 49, bludgeoned his wife Diana, right, 40, to death with an iron bar as she slept in March 2010 . Mrs Garbutt, 40, was found beaten to death in an upstairs bedroom at the three-bedroomed stone house after her husband dialled 999 and said armed robbers had burst in and attacked his wife. Police and paramedics initially responded to a report of an armed robbery, and in the days that followed, detectives appealed for help to catch a balaclava-cald man with a gun. However they arrested Garbutt on suspicion of murdering his wife three weeks later, and established that he had beaten her with a 30cm iron bar as she slept in the flat above the shop. Garbutt's lies - he also said the 'raiders' had taken £10,000 from the shop - were exposed when it emerged that the couple were heavily in debt. Teesside Crown Court also heard that the couple's marriage was on the rocks as Mrs Garbutt's libido was far stronger than her husband's, which had led her to have relationships with other men. Jurors found Garbutt guilty of murdering his wife, and as he was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to serve at least 20 years, Mrs Garbutt's mother wept in court. Since the killing in 2010, the property has stood empty, but now villagers question whether the former shop and post office may reopen. It was sold at auction by Hunters in York on 30 July with a guide price of £130,000, on behalf of Mr Garbutt's estate. The building in Melsonby, left, has now been bought by Diana Garbutt's mother, Agnes Gaylor, 64, right . His brother-in-law Mark Stilborn said: 'She [Mrs Gaylor] said she felt she had to do it because she had to finish the kitchen for Diana. 'I don't know what she wants to do with the property then.' During Garbutt's trial in 2011, it emerged that had chatted to a friend the day before her death about the progress of a kitchen the couple were having fitted. Bill Nixon, who runs Nixon's Garage, across the road from the post office, said there was surprise in the village that Mrs Garbutt's mother had bought the property where her daughter had died. But he added: 'The feelings of the majority of people in Melsonby are that we want our post office and shop back.' Mr Nixon, a parish councillor said the fate of the premises had been discussed at a recent parish council meeting, and councillors hoped to contact Mrs Gaylor to discover what she intended to do with the property. Mr Stilborn said the family continued to protest Garbutt's innocence and were preparing a file for the Criminal Cases Review Commission in a bid to challenge the conviction.","Diana Garbutt, 40, was bludgeoned to death by her husband, Robin, in 2010 .

"A gang of drug dealers who posed for pictures with wads of cash and a large bag stuffed with cannabis have been jailed for a total of four and a half years today. More than 100 detectives seized large quantities of cash and drugs in a series of dawn raids on 18 North Kensington homes in May, following a bloody turf war. Mobile phones were also found containing images of the shameless gang members posing with drugs and banknotes. These pictures of Sophian Chhayra, 24, (pictured left) holding a bag of cannabis and Zakaria Chentouf, 24, (pictured right) holding a wad of cash were found by police officers on phones seized during dawn raids . Sophian Chhayra, 24, poses with a large wad of £50 notes. The image was found on a phone seized by police . Scotland Yard detectives uncovered the ring while investigating a spate of violent attacks  which had erupted in the area at the end of last year. Officers realised the violence stemmed from a drugs war over gang territory and launched an undercover operation code-named Operation Capulet. During the raids police found phones containing incriminating images. In one shot Zakaria Chentouf, 24, is seen perched on a bed showing off a wad several inches thick of £50 notes. Another image shows Sophian Chhayra, also 24, grinning while holding a transparent plastic bag stuffed with cannabis to his chest. A final picture of Chhayra shows the him clutching a large amount of £50 notes with both hands in front of his face. All five defendants pleaded guilty to drugs offences at Isleworth Crown Court in September and were today sentenced to a total of four-and-a-half years in prison for their parts in the organised ring which dealt cannabis on the streets of Ladbroke Grove in West London. Zakaria Chentouf, 24, (pictured left) was handed a 16 month sentence for his role in the drug ring, while Sophian Chhayra, 24, (pictured right)was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment . The court heard Fouad Soussi, aged 20, who was born profoundly deaf, was the 'principal street dealer' in the operation - exchanging drugs for cash in plain sight from his balcony and nearby streets, Isleworth Crown Court heard. Defending him Alison Morgan told the judge he had become desperate to make his own money after struggling to find work because of his disability. He was supplied the drugs by Chentouf, 24, who was described in court as the 'head of the conspiracy'. Ahmed Mahomud, 20, and Chhayra, acted as middlemen and runners, Tyrone Silcott, prosecuting, told the court. All four pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply drugs last month. The court heard a fifth man, Ahmed Mahomud's brother Yousif, 19, was only involved as a runner in one drug deal. He pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of class B drugs. Yousif Mohamud, 19 (pictured left) was handed a 12-week sentence to be served in a young offenders' institute, while his older brother Ahmed Mohamud, 20, (pictured right) was given 10 months inprisonment . Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson said today: 'The evidence in this case reveals, during the period which I am concerned with, there was sustained, high level drug dealing in terms of cannabis. He added he had 'no doubt' that the street dealing led to 'violence'. 'Also it leads to distress and concern among local residents who have to witness this sort of overt behaviour,' said Judge McGregor-Johnson. 'Apart from you, Yousif Mahomud, I have to sentence four of you for your respective parts in a conspiracy to supply cannabis. 'That conspiracy was over a six week period and looking at the overall picture was a highly active conspiracy dealing to many customers each day. Fouad Soussi, 20, was today sentenced to 15 months detention in a young offenders institute . 'I do not accept the submission made on your behalf Fouad Soussi that your role was on the borderline between lesser and significant. 'You were pivotal in this enterprise but bearing in mind the quantity being dealt I regard the proper assessment of your role as significant. 'Zakaria Chentouf, I take the same view of your involvement but I note the quantity of drug money found in your possession - that doesn't happen by accident.' Chentouf was caught with £3,000 profit from the street dealing ring. Chhayra also played a 'significant' role but was slightly below his cohorts, the court heard. 'Ahmed Mahomud you were highly active during the course of this conspiracy, at least in my view in a subordinate capacity to some of the others who have pleaded guilty to the conspiracy,' continued the judge. The court heard Soussi and Chhayra were of previous good character. Addressing Chhayra, the judge said: 'At the time you had a job which distinguishes you from everybody else in this case. 'That is a good thing but it makes it even less understandable why you chose to get involved in this sort of enterprise - there is no reason whatsoever unless you got some sort of buzz.' Today Soussi, from the Wornington Estate, was sentenced to 15 months detention in a young offenders institution and Chentouf, from Humber Drive in Kensal Green, was handed a 16-month prison term. Mahomud, from St Mark's Road in North Kensington, and Chhayra, from the Wornington Estate, were each sentenced to 10 months in prison. Yousif, who lived with his brother, was sentenced to 12 weeks in a young offenders institute and had an eight week suspended sentence activated. The Mahomud brothers and Chhayra walked free from court having already served nearly six months on remand. Chentouf also pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods, possession of criminal property and possession of cocaine and was sentenced to an extra nine months. All except Yousif Mahomud received Asbo orders banning them parts of Ladbroke Grove.","More than 100 police officers seized cash and drugs in series of dawn raids .

"Stealing the show at the Interstellar film premiere this week wasn’t its star, Anne Hathaway, but rather her necklace . . . or should that be ‘backlace’? For the 31-year-old accessorised her deep-blue satin Richard Nicoll gown with a delicate silver chain decorated with stars which hung down her back instead of her decolletage. But she’s far from the first actress to challenge convention with this look: Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman and Kate Hudson have all worn the back necklace — or ‘back drop’ — on the red carpet in recent years. In fact, Princess Diana even tried it with pearls nearly 30 years ago. Scroll down for video . Anne Hathaway stole the show at the Interstellar premiere with her backlace - a delicate silver chain decorated with stars . When done well, it can be deeply sexy. Subtler than a piece that nestles in the cleavage, a heavy chain hanging between the shoulder blades is a signal of independence: not for you the boring convention or obvious statement. And, as the back ages so well and wrinkles less than other parts of the body, it’s a marvellous way for an older woman to draw attention away from a crepey bosom. There’s something, too, about the slight weight of that drop at the back that seems to improve posture, straightening the shoulders, raising the head and pushing the pelvis forward, to show the jewellery off to best advantage. Not every necklace or dress will work for this look. A lariat works best: a favourite of flappers showing off their daring backless frocks, it is a long, clasp-free chain or string of gems that can be knotted or looped at just the right spot, leaving the remaining length to hang dramatically down the spine. The 31-year-old accessorised her deep-blue satin Richard Nicoll gown with a chain which hung down her back instead of her decolletage . Other necklaces are designed specifically for this look, with tiers and loops that are shaped for the width of a shoulder rather than a chest, and clasps where they won’t be seen. But even a simple pendant can work beautifully: a heavy, jewelled tassel, for example, adds the necessary weight to hold the necklace in place, rather than having it slip forward or tangle up in your hair or a dress. The crucial factor, though, is to give the necklace room to breathe: it should not clash with the straps of a dress, the back of a corset, or long, loose hair, but drape elegantly into the space created by a deep-cut back unimpeded by straps or corsetry. Here we look at the stars who really have put their necks on the line. NICOLE KIDMAN . It’s a good job that this Balenciaga dress is as plain as can be, because for the 2008 Academy Awards, 47-year-old Nicole Kidman donned a massive 1,399 carats of rough diamonds designed into an immense collar by L’Wren Scott. While it looks like a back necklace, it can be worn either way. This one works, but its ostentatiousness lacks some of the panache of simple pendants and lariats. CATE BLANCHETT . This look couldn’t be better. The 45-year-old’s silk Givenchy dress with its deep asymmetrical back is complemented by the V shape formed by Van Cleef & Arpel’s Zip necklace (it actually does zip up and down) with its diamond chain and pink sapphire tassel. The soft rose-gold warms up that expanse of skin, too, and the simple shape works on a character as strong as Cate. KATE HUDSON . Looking pitch-perfect at the Screen Actors’ Guild Awards in 2010, 35-year-old Kate Hudson gets everything right here, teaming a high-necked, long-sleeved Emilio Pucci gown with a Cartier diamond-tassel necklace, which swings down a plunging back. The diamonds pick up the sparkle of the white dress, and the simplicity of the silhouette leaves room for the necklace to really shine. No wonder she looks happy. NAOMI WATTS . There’s so much to love here — and the biggest thing is that incredible Serpenti ‘Ultimate Temptation’ necklace from Bulgari: 60 carats of diamonds, with a 12.16-carat diamond drop at the tip. Its construction means that the serpent’s tail drapes languidly down the back, neat but fluid at the same time. The 46-year-old actress’s side-swept hair gives the necklace plenty of space, revealing a long neck and toned shoulders. The dark sparkles on the pretty Marchesa dress, however, do clash somewhat with all that glittering ice. CARA DELEVINGNE . The weight of the chimpanzee pendant by de Grisogono — featuring 771 black diamonds, yellow-sapphire bananas and a massive 28-carat sapphire — makes 22-year-old Cara’s necklace hang beautifully, and the short length means it perfectly frames her tattoo, rather than clashing with it. Having a real feature, such as this extraordinary animal, is a great idea, giving some purpose to the back-to-front necklace. What does clash, though, is the dark metal chain of the necklace and the silvery chain on her dress straps. JENNIFER LAWRENCE . Like Anne Hathaway, 24-year-old Jennifer Lawrence is a veteran of the back necklace, wearing a long one over a high-backed dress in 2013. Here, at the 2014 Oscars, she makes a better job of it by choosing a shorter necklace, with the Neil Lane diamonds daintily drawing attention to her rear-view. Exquisite. JESSICA BIEL . Biel, 32, breaks a cardinal rule of the backlace, with loose hair — but gets away with it. It’s partly down to the length of that Tiffany & Co necklace, partly because the whole look is so elaborate thanks to the Elie Saab dress, and because her posture makes the necklace swing loose from her back.","Anne Hathaway stole the show at the Interstellar premiere with her backlace .

"A father and son targeted in a bungled police sting into stolen scrap metal have been cleared after a two-year legal battle which is thought to have cost the taxpayer more than £300,000. David Day, 36, and his father Terrence, 61, were arrested and kept in police cells for eight hours after officers posing as scrap metal thieves tried to sell them what appeared to be stolen railway cable. Although they refused to buy the items, the two undercover detectives are thought to visited their scrapyard 12 times to push the sale of what appeared to be stolen scrap metal. David, left, and Terrence Day, right, at the Greengate Metals scrapyard in Middleton were held in police cells for eight hours after a bungled police sting in 2012 . Both men, who run Greengate Metals in Middleton, Greater Manchester, and colleague Billy Dillon, 57, were later charged with attempting to handle stolen goods, and encouraging the act of the stripping of railways cable. If convicted, they could have faced up to five years in jail. But after a trial at Bolton Crown Court, all three men were acquitted of wrongdoing after it emerged the officers were working from an inaccurate edict from British Telecom and Railtrack - which wrongly claimed that certain cable offered on the open market must be stolen. The sting occurred in 2012 during an operation against various scrap metal dealers in the area - and 17 suspects were arrested in total. Last month, three other scrap dealers targeted in the same police operation were cleared after a judge accused the undercover officers of 'wearing down' their suspects into accepting what appeared to appeared to be stolen cable. David, from Blackley, Manchester said: 'The last two years have been hell. It's tarnished our name. None of us have ever been in trouble. David, pictured at the scrapyard, said they initially refused to buy the railway cable but agreed to buy copper wire when the undercover officers returned a week later . 'Being in the dock was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. We knew we had not done anything wrong but we didn't know how the jury were thinking. 'Before our arrest we had about 150 visits from police over the space of two years. 'Every time they came to the yard they always went around and never found anything yet despite us getting visits once or twice a week, they've always been treated with respect.' He explained the first time the officers tried to sell them railway cable, they had refused - only for them to return two days later. A week later, the officers returned with copper wire and the Days agreed to buy with the belief it was legitimately sourced and IDs were taken.. In October 2012 around 60 officers swooped on the scrapyard. Mr Day added: 'Being kept in police cells for eight hours was the worst experience. The business had to be put on hold and my wife and kids became nervous wrecks. My wife was ringing me up in tears when she saw police vans. 'There were times when we were considering selling up, my dad retiring.' 'It's been a waste of taxpayers money. I've been told that each day we were in court it was costing £20,000 and we were in court for 18 full days.' He added that he had also spent £10,000 installing CCTV in the scrapyard. The sting affected trade at the scrapyard. David said: 'There were times when we were considering selling up' David added the lengthy legal battle, which is thought to have cost more than £300,000, was a 'waste of money' Mr Day's lawyer Sean Reilly said BT and Railtrack's error was a major flaw in the investigation. He said: 'BT and Railtrack had told the police, erroneously, that certain specification cable was only manufactured for their industry, and that it does not exist on the open market, that this cable can only be owned by BT and Rail track. 'This was wrong. Companies that manufacture cable are happy to sell their cable to whoever will buy it, after all they are in business to make profit and the more they sell the more profit they make. 'Companies that buy from the manufacturers also sell off cuts on to the open market.' A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police said: 'We are aware that a judge has raised concerns about a policing tactic used in an operation to target metal theft dealers suspected of handling stolen metal. 'Following the judge's comments, the Crown Prosecution Service is reviewing other upcoming cases involved in this operation. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'","David Day, 36, and father Terrence, 61, were targeted at scrapyard in 2012 .

"The European football season's annual curtain-raiser takes place on Tuesday night when Real Madrid meet Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup in Cardiff. Though a friendly in all but name, it is a chance for the two sides to lay down a marker ahead of the new campaign. Here's all you need to know about the Super Cup showdown in the Welsh capital. What is the Super Cup? The annual match is organised by UEFA as a sort of starting pistol for the new European season and is between the winners of the previous season's Champions League and Europa League. So on this occasion, it's Real Madrid, who beat their city rivals Atletico 4-1 in Lisbon back in May, taking on Sevilla, who defeated Benfica on penalties in Turin. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sergio Ramos nutmeg James Rodriguez in training . Historic triumph: Real Madrid beat their city rivals Atletico 4-1 in Lisbon to win a 10th European Cup in May . Spot on: Sevilla beat Benfica on penalties to win the Europa League in Turin last season . Where is this all-Spanish showdown taking place? In Cardiff... obviously. This year's Super Cup will be held at the 33,000-capacity Cardiff City Stadium, which is, as you might have guessed, the home of Championship side Cardiff City. It is also the venue for most Wales football internationals. Getting ready: The Cardiff City Stadium is preparing to welcome Real Madrid and Sevilla for the Super Cup . Hang on, isn't this match usually played in Monaco? It was, yes, at the Stade Louis II between 1998 and 2012. But UEFA decided to take the competition on the road and, rather like the finals of the Champions League and the Europa League, it will have a different host city each year. Last year, the venue was the Eden Arena in Prague as Bayern Munich beat Chelsea on penalties after a 2-2 draw. And next year it's heading to Tbilisi, Georgia. Holders: Bayern Munich beat Chelsea on penalties to win last year's Super Cup in Prague . I remember the match being later in August - has it moved? It has moved, about two weeks forward in the calendar. It was on August 30 last season and was usually held on the last Friday in the month alongside the group stage draws for the European competitions, but with FIFA deciding to abolish the August international friendlies, it made sense to bring it forward to the empty slot. The problem with holding it on a Friday night at the end of August was that the domestic leagues have usually started and the two participants had to re-arrange a league game to make room. The move alleviates this concern. Is there much interest in the match? Well, according to the front cover of Monday's AS newspaper, 8,000 Spanish fans are heading over to Cardiff. There does seem to be plenty of local interest as well, with the Cardiff City website saying over the weekend that only a limited number of restricted view tickets were available. Tickets have sold well despite pretty expensive price categories of £110, £75 and £40. Invasion: 8,000 Spanish fans are expected in the Welsh capital, according to newspaper AS . I can't get to Cardiff... is it on the TV? Yes. You have a choice of watching it on ITV4 (coverage starts at 7.30pm for a 7.45pm kick-off) or the newly-launched Sky Sports 5. Who's the man in the middle? England's Mark Clattenburg is set to take charge. It will be the first match in a UEFA club competition to use the vanishing spray that proved so popular at the World Cup. Man in the middle: England's Mark Clattenburg will take charge of the European curtain-raiser . Have the teams played in the Super Cup before? They have. Real lifted the trophy in 2002, when they beat UEFA Cup holders Feyenoord 3-1 in Monaco. They have also lost two finals, to Cup Winners' Cup holders Chelsea in 1998 and Galatasaray in 2000. Sevilla beat Barcelona 3-0 to win the Super Cup in 2006 but they lost 3-1 to Milan on their return visit the following year. Sole success: Real Madrid lifted the Super Cup for the one and only time when they beat Feyenoord in 2002 . What are they playing for? The Super Cup trophy has had various guises over the years and the latest silver one looks pretty sleek and modern. It is 58cm high and weights in at 12.2kg. Sevilla's Javi Navarro was the first to lift the new version back in August 2006. The trophy has been sight-seeing this last week along with its siblings the European Cup and the Europa League trophy - they were all carried up to the summit of Snowdon by two die-hard football fans. They have also been on display in Bangor, Aberystwyth, Llanelli and Cardiff on the roadshow. What a view! The Super Cup trophy has scaled Wales's highest peak, Mount Snowdon, this week . Trio: And the Super Cup was accompanied to the summit by the Champions League and Europa League cups . Who's in charge? Carlo Ancelotti joined Bob Paisley in football posterity when he won his third European Cup back in May, the success in Lisbon added to two triumphs when at Milan. He had arrived at the Bernabeu from Paris Saint-Germain the previous summer and, although they couldn't keep up with neighbours Atletico in the league, they exacted their revenge in the European final. Real also won the Copa del Rey, beating Barcelona thanks to Bale's sensational solo goal, to endear Ancelotti even more to the fans. VIDEO Ancelotti predicts big season for Bale . Hat-trick: Carlo Ancelotti won his third Champions League when Real beat Atletico in the final . Quick success: Unai Emery has guided Sevilla to fifth in La Liga and Europa League glory . Unai Emery replaced Michel at the helm in January 2013 and led Sevilla to a fifth place finish in his first full season as well as the Europa League. It is the third time Sevilla have won the competition, all of those coming in the last eight years. Who's going to be on display? The fans in Cardiff will be among the first to see Real's latest crop of Galacticos in action. With £70m Colombian sensation James Rodriguez and £20m German midfield master Toni Kroos joining Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, Real will undoubtedly have the most feared forward line in Europe in the coming season. Hot shot: James Rodriguez posing this week with the Adidas Golden Boot award won for scoring six times for Colombia at the World Cup finals in Brazil . Homecoming: Gareth Bale is set to play for Real Madrid in his home city of Cardiff . It is a homecoming for Bale, who scored in the Champions League final, as he was brought up in the city, attended Whitchurch High School and started out with Cardiff Civil Service FC. Sevilla's team will be worth a fraction of Real's, and they sold Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic to Barcelona in June, but they could still trouble their more illustrious opponents. To mark the launch of their new European football channel, Sky Sports have unleashed a giant football at the Cardiff City Stadium. Sky Sports 5, which starts broadcasting on Tuesday just in time for the UEFA Super Cup between Real Madrid and Sevilla, will show up to 600 live fixtures from the Champions League, La Liga, Copa del Rey, Coppa Italia, Eredivisie and Euro 2016 qualifiers. The inflatable ball measures 13.71m (45ft) in diameter and is 65 times the size of a regular ball. Massive: Sky Sports have inflated a giant football in the Cardiff City Stadium to mark the launch of their new European football channel, Sky Sports 5 . Transfer business this summer . Apart from the aforementioned Rodriguez and Kroos, Real have also added Costa Rica's goalkeeper from the World Cup, Keylor Navas, who has joined from Levante for £9m. They have waved goodbye to striker Alvaro Morata, who was looking increasingly surplus to requirements, and joined Juventus for £17m. Real have the option to buy the 21-year-old back if he develops well in the future. Sevilla have been quite busy in the market. Rakitic is the biggest departure, moving to Barcelona for £15m. Incoming are defensive midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak from Reims, winger Aleix Vidal from Almeria, centre-back Nicolas Pareja from Spartak Moscow and Reading centre-back Daniel Carrico. Moving on: Ivan Rakitic has joined Barcelona from Sevilla over the summer . Who's going to win? Real will be the heavy favourites. They are tipped for a free-scoring and successful campaign given their firepower up front and will want to stamp their authority here, as well as picking up another trophy for their ever-growing collection. Any links between Wales and Spain? Yes, right down to the Welsh DNA. Professor John Koch has suggested that the Welsh can trace their ancestry back to Spain and Portugal. His research of archaeological inscriptions offers evidence that the Celts were settled in Iberia before migrating northwards. There is, of course, also a lineage of footballers from Wales who have played in Spain. Bale aside, Wrexham's Mark Hughes played for Barcelona in 1986-1987 after moving from Manchester United. Welsh wonder: Mark Hughes played a season for Barcelona in 1989-1990 after moving from Man United . Spanish success: John Toshack pictured during his second spell at Real Madrid . John Toshack managed Real Madrid in two spells, Real Sociedad in three and also Deportivo La Coruna and Real Murcia. Tosh won Madrid their fifth consecutive league title in 1989-1990, breaking both the points and goals records. Know where I can get some Spanish food in Cardiff?

"Siem de Jong is a major doubt for Newcastle United’s season opener against Manchester City.

"The row between Sporting Lisbon and Doyen Sports over who gets what out of Marcos Rojo's proposed transfer to Manchester United is poised to end up in court unless a quick resolution can be found. Doyen own 75 per cent of Rojo's rights and Sporting are contractually bound to pay the fund 75 per cent of any rejected bid. Sporting also say 20 per cent of any fee received over £4million for Rojo is also due to go to his previous club Spartak Moscow. Clear? VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Rojo likes to have a hit from range as this compilation shows' Rebel: Rojo (right) has handed in a transfer request in order to force a move to Manchester United . United have so far tabled an offer worth a reported £16million, which falls short of his £30million release clause, meaning Sporting will have to pay £12million if they continue to reject United's offer - and their 75 per cent. Doyen confirmed that they will vigorously pursue that figure, whilst also threatening the Portuguese outfit with legal action if no payment is made. Sporting have now cancelled their contract with Doyen citing 'just cause'. In a statement Doyen said: '(Sporting are) making mindless demands as a condition of releasing the player. 'If Sporting want to keep Rojo they must compensate the fund under the terms and deadlines set forth by the contract. If necessary we will not hesitate to use every legal resource at our disposal to fully defend our rights and interests.' Naughty boy: Marcos Rojo (left) is set to face disciplinary action from his club Sporting Lisbon . Rojo has become a key figure for United as Louis van Gaal wants a left-sided centre-back who can bring the ball out of defence unlike Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. United are not confident at this stage in their ability to prise Angel di Maria from Real Madrid. They are the player's best option should he leave but it is understood Carlo Ancelotti would prefer other members of their foreign contingent to be sacrificed. Madrid need one non-EU player to go so they can recruit Radamel Falcao from Monaco. Any United move for Arturo Vidal of Juventus remains on the sidelines also at the moment. Foot on the ball: Any United move for Arturo Vidal of Juventus remains grounded for now . VIDEO Allegri confident of keeping Vidal . Juventus have made an enquiry for Benfica centre-back Luisao that could pave the way for Arsenal to sign Kostas Manolas from Olympiacos for £8million. Towering Brazilian Luisao is eager to get a move done to Turin before Juve sign somebody else with Manolas high on their options. Strategic advisor at Olympiacos, Christian Karembeu, admits Juventus have made an offer for 23-year-old Manolas, but so too have English clubs. Karembeu said: 'The Bianconeri are interested in the player and have made a good offer. They are not the only ones, though… In the last few days interesting proposals have also arrived from England. At the back: With Luisao potentially moving to Juventus, Kostas Monolas (left) could turn attention to Arsenal . 'The price, pretty much, is this - we are not willing to negotiate for less than €10m. We have not set a deadline. If we receive the right offer, we will sell him. Otherwise, we will keep him.' The former Middlesbrough midfielder was asked if he was surprised by the attention now on Manolas: 'No. We were certain that he would become a player in the international market, even more so after the great World Cup with Greece. 'His preferred destination? Juve are top of his wishes, but Kostas has an emotional attachment to Olympiacos. He has a deal with the President, he will accept the team that will meet the economic needs of the club. Be that Juve or an English club. 'I think he would be fine with Juventus’ defenders. Kostas can be used indifferently in a back three or four. He is so fast he could play at the back by himself!' Hull City and Crystal Palace have expressed interest in free agent Nicklas Bendtner but face competition from Bundesliga side Wolfsburg. The 26-year-old Dane has an offer from Olympiacos also but the prospect of playing in the Premier League again or the Bundesliga is more appealing. Strike: Nicklas Bendtner is still a free agent, but could be on his way back to the Premier League . Cardiff City's search for defensive re-inforcements has led them to Reading's Sean Morrison. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has asked for Michael Keane on loan from Manchester United, as have Blackburn, but Solskjaer has also enquired about Watford's defender Joel Ekstrand prior to bidding for Reading's Morrison. He will have a medical at Cardiff on Thursday as will Norwich winger Anthony Pilkington. Norwich, meanwhile, have expressed an interest in Chris Wood of Leicester City after his proposed move to Wolves fell through. Peterborough are keen on Wolves striker Liam McAlinden. Charlton are in talks with Championship side Charlton are hoping to sign Alain Traore from Lorient on a season-long loan. Deportivo La Coruna are hoping to pull off a double loan signing from the Premier League after holding further talks with Manchester City for midfielder Bruno Zuculini and with Fulham for Kostas Mitroglou. Zuculini has plenty of interest and City were keen to loan him out in the Premier League with Sunderland an option but Deportivo are hopeful they have persuaded Manuel Pellegrini to send him their way instead. Stuck in: Deportivo have held further talks with Manchester City for midfielder Bruno Zuculini (left) Mitroglou has been talking to former club Olympiacos but Deportivo are willing to pay the £2.5million loan fee that Fulham are chasing. Mitroglou has started only one match for Fulham since arriving in January for £10million and was not in the squad for their opening day Championship defeat to Ipswich Town last weekend. City are in discussions over deals to either sell or loan John Guidetti and Scott Sinclair while they hope to formally announce Sergio Aguero signing his new contract very soon. Misfit: Kostas Mitroglou has been in talks with former club Olympiacos, but Deportivo are also interested . Aston Villa defender Joe Bennett is attracting interest from other Premier League and Championship clubs following the arrival of Aly Cissokho and Kieran Richardson. Bennett, 24, a £2.75million signing from Middlesbrough in 2012. QPR had made tentative enquiries as have Brighton but both have since moved on to other targets. Brighton are returning for Stephen Ward who was on loan from Wolves last season. West Bromwich Albion are poised to bid £7.25million for West Ham winger Matt Jarvis. The 28-year-old has failed to rediscover the form that earned him an England call-up while at Wolves and the Upton Park club will sell. Albion have gone cool on Jonathan Biabiany from Parma with the Italian club looking for £8million. Jarvis at least would be aware of what is required in the Premier League, which would be an advantage over Biabiany in terms of transition. Winger: West Bromwich Albion are poised to bid £7.25million for West Ham's Matt Jarvis . Vic Alderweireld, the father and agent of Atletico Madrid centre-back Toby Alderweireld, has urged the club to send the Belgian international out on loan so the he can play more. Premier League clubs have interest in the left-sided defender and in and interview with Het Nieuwsblad, the elder Alderweireld stressed: 'Toby wants to play, going out on loan would be the best option. If there is a solution, Atletico won’t stand in his way. 'Since last year, we’ve had several discussions on this issue and Atletico understands that we don’t think it makes sense to leave Toby on the bench for another year.'

"It does come around quickly. There will have been under five weeks between Philipp Lahm lifting the World Cup in Brazil and Manchester United kicking off the new Premier League season. In a sense not a lot has changed since Manuel Pellegrini clawed back the title in May. City's attempts to retain their crown hinge on an ability to keep Chelsea, United, Liverpool and Arsenal at bay. Jose Mourinho will typify prickle, Arsene Wenger's counsel should remain intact. Five men, however, are hoping that 2014/15 is the campaign when everything alters for the better. There is a quintet who've starred this pre-season for their respective clubs and may be ready to spring a surprise after being firmly thrust the tag 'flop' previously. Find the net: Stevan Jovetic has four goals in two pre-season games over in America for Man City . Yes, notching during meaningless friendlies against varying opposition isn't a definitive barometer as to how individuals will perform come the first week of the season, but Sportsmail takes a look at a few who may fancy themselves on August 16. Stevan Jovetic (Manchester City) 'I have said before that Stevan is a very important player for us, and he proved again what an asset he can be,' Pellegrini said after Jovetic scored twice against Liverpool over in America this week. And the Chilean is right - here is a striker with real pedigree. It's the reason why City spent £22million on the front man this time last year and why, despite his chronic injury problems, they are willing to stick by him. While Jovetic will be the first to admit he doesn't score enough goals - although it's four in two games for him in the International Champions Cup - there is a certain flicker of added life he brings on the edge of the box. Pellegrini ended that press conference post-Liverpool by saying: 'If he's fit all the year, he will be a very important player for us.' If a line summed up a player's situation, it was that. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger praise four-goal striker Yaya Sanogo . Key cog: Manuel Pellegrini is placing plenty of faith in Jovetic given the Montenegran manages to stay fit . VIDEO Liverpool v Manchester City highlights . Ashley Young (Manchester United) Young is a very interesting case indeed. At 29, the argument most prevalent is that this is a winger to have wasted his talent and coasted after Sir Alex Ferguson paid Aston Villa more than £15million for him in 2011. But there is a sense that Louis van Gaal has sent a rocket in Young's direction, with the England international indicating against Real Madrid that he has more intent from wide areas and isn't afraid to take his man on inside or out. Crucially Young has been smiling in America. It's not often over the last two years you've been able to say that. A happy winger is one who will frighten full-backs. Point to prove: Ashley Young scored twice against Real Madrid for Manchester United this week . No worries: New United boss Louis van Gaal is the sort of manager who is able to get the best out of Young . Yaya Sanogo (Arsenal) It was difficult not to feel sorry for poor old Sanogo during his first term in English football. Plucked from Auxerre after scoring 10 goals in Ligue 2 - that's two, not the top division - he immediately became a figure of fun with a gangly style and apparent lack of goalscoring inclination. But this is a man who is only 21, and one with next to no knowledge of competing in a premier division at that. The four goals against Benfica over the weekend, therefore, will do him the world of good. The Frenchman clearly knows where the net is. They were the finishes of a striker who may have a say for Arsenal off the bench if nothing else this year. No more Sanogoal? Man of the people: Arsenal's Yaya Sanogo could be ready to prove observers wrong at the Emirates . Not a bad start! Sanogo scored four times against a hapless Benfica in a friendly on Saturday afternoon . Roberto Soldado (Tottenham) A healthy portion of Andre Villas-Boas' Gareth Bale-induced bumper transfer kitty of 2013 was spent on a striker who seemingly could only take penalties. So it seemed, and that isn't an unfair conclusion to draw from a first year littered with missed chances, head-dropping and sulky frowns. But one thing has always remained constant with Spurs fans: they are willing to back Soldado. And why on earth not? This is the same front man to lead Valencia's line for three goal-laden years and who commanded £26million. That, the La Liga side felt, was his market value at the time. It is with some encouragement then that he is back among the scorers during this pre-season with two against Celtic - albeit a young side after the seniors had been given a thorough hiding by Legia Warsaw in the Champions League. He is laying on for others and puts in more work that given credit for. Mauricio Pochettino may just get the best from him yet. A new man? Roberto Soldado has looked more threatening for Tottenham under Mauricio Pochettino . Lead: David Nugent is hoping for Leicester goals . David Nugent (Leicester City) That goal. You know the one. Andorra away, circa 2007. Nugent, during his only cap for England, robbed Jermain Defoe a goal by pouncing on his effort - that was going over the line - to steal unwarranted glory. In fact, that split-second decision didn't fare particularly well for Nugent in the ensuing years. He was seen as a bit of a joke and poster boy for the ill-fated reign of Steve McClaren as national boss. But those assumptions are a touch unfair. Nugent is, and has always been, a very competent striker at the top end of the Championship with the potential to ruffle Premier League feathers. Now under Nigel Pearson at Leicester he should spearhead their attack (even with the overpriced Leonardo Ulloa having signed from Brighton). While the Andorran goalhanging is what he may forever be remembered for, a deft outside of the boot beauty against Crewe - which went viral on the internet - is more in tune with what the ex-Portsmouth striker is capable of. Remember this? Nugent scored a ridiculous solitary goal for England away in Andorra seven years ago .","Manchester United and City hoping stars improve this year .

"Kell Brook pulled off a stunning upset to dethrone Shawn Porter and win the IBF welterweight world title on Saturday night. The Sheffield star recovered from a slow start in Los Angeles to gradually impose himself on the unbeaten champion. One judge scored the fight level but the other two marked it in Brook's favour, albeit by flattering margins of 117-111 and 116-112.

Smothering: Porter dominated the inside exchanges at first but struggled to keep up with the pace . Next up? A fight with Amir Khan could lie in wait for the talented Brook . Porter, who had won the title from Devon Alexander last year, was relentless in the first half of the fight as he forced his opponent back. A cut opened up above Brook's left eye as early as the second round but it was clear from the initial exchanges that the Brit was landing the cleaner shots. In the face of the champion's smothering tactics however, Brook was unable to put his combinations together as Porter took advantage of a weak referee to lead with his head. But by the halfway stage, the 26-year-old from Ohio began to tire and a second clash of heads left him too cut above his eye. Brook, who saw three title fights with then champion Alexander cancelled through injury in 2013, began to impose himself as Porter struggled to display the power that stopped Paulie Malignaggi in brutal fashion four months ago.

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is confident his title-winning team is better now that it was 12 months ago. The defending champions launched their Barclays Premier League campaign with a hard-fought 2-0 win at Newcastle. Pellegrini was delighted with a victory which came despite many of his World Cup stars having gone into the game short of match fitness, but, while he knows there will be stiff competition once again this season, he is certain City have grown during his time at the club. VIDEO Scroll down for Pellegrini: This is a squad that can fight to win everything . Confident: Manuel Pellegrini is adamant that his title-winning City squad has progressed during his first year . Progress: Pellegrini instructs his side during their first league game of the season, a 2-0 win over Newcastle . Champions: Manuel Pellegrini won the Premier League title during his first year in English football last season . He said: 'It's very difficult to compare each year. Maybe last year a lot of people doubted we could win the title because it was my first season here in the Premier League. 'Today, we have one year more working with the players and I think we have also a strong squad. 'But always in England in the Premier League, you have five or six teams that can win the title, so we need to have the same attitude as we had today, the hunger with which we have started the season, the same humility with which we played today in every game. New recruit: Right-back Bacary Sagna has signed for Manchester City from Arsenal this summer . Competition: Willy Caballero (right) will compete with Joe Hart (left) to be City's number one keeper . Big deal: Centre-back Eliaquim Mangala signed from Porto this summer for £32 million . 'I am sure this squad can fight, and we will see at the end of the season which titles we will win.' City got their noses in front when David Silva expertly converted Edin Dzeko's clever 38th-minute back-heeled pass, but they had to wait until stoppage time at the end of the game at St James' Park to wrap up victory. Sergio Aguero secured the points with a close-range finish after goalkeeper Tim Krul had blocked his initial effort, although only a remarkable block by Fernando had denied Newcastle a late equaliser minutes earlier. Up and running: David Silva scored Manchester City's first league goal of the season against Newcastle . Three points: Sergio Aguero wrapped up the 2-0 victory for Manchester City, scoring in stoppage time . Scorers: Pellegrini will hope to have Silva and Aguero in fine form this season as City attempt to retain the title . Pellegrini said: 'I am very happy because I think it's always important to start the season winning, especially when you have to play away at so difficult a stadium as St James' - it's always a difficult stadium for every team that comes here. 'Maybe in the second half we couldn't have so much possession of the ball because seven of our 10 [outfield] players were not able to play 90 minutes at the same pace. 'But we were very concentrated, very well organised and we kept a clean sheet, and finally we decided the game with a second goal.' Opposite number Alan Pardew was able to take positives from defeat in a game which saw him hand competitive debuts to Daryl Janmaat, Jack Colback, Remy Cabella and Emmanuel Riviere, with Ayoze Perez and Rolando Aarons getting a first taste from the bench. Pardew said: 'I honestly feel we have come up against individuals today who we are not going to see every week. 'Some of their play is outstanding and you have only got to see it close up to know the quality of [Samir] Nasri and Silva, the power of Yaya Toure, and Dzeko up front is a real handful, and I thought we coped with it as well as we could. 'When you play the top teams, you need a break - there's no doubt about that. Quality: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew accepts the world class players of Manchester City were too good . 'Whenever I have won against the tops sides, you get a break in the game and it didn't happen for us today. We didn't get a ricochet or something that fell our way. 'But I am as pleased as I can be with a 2-0 defeat.' Pardew was less than polite to his opposite number when the sides met on Tyneside last season, but there was no repeat this time around. Pellegrini said: 'I don't have any problems with Alan. It was a mistake that he made the other season, but he apologised in the moment, and I told him in the same moment, ""Don't you worry about that, it's finished and all forgiven."" 'There was no problem. He had a lot of problems last year - not only with me. It's a new season and everyone learns from things.'","Reigning champions began title defence with 2-0 win at Newcastle .
Pellegrini believes his current squad improved during his first season at City .
Eliaquim Mangala, Fernando, Willy Caballero and Bacary Sagna have signed for the club this summer transfer window ."
"The Virgin Galactic space tourism program was plagued with fuel issues for years ahead of the fatal mid-air explosion today that came after the company's space-craft trialed a new propulsion system. One pilot died yesterday when a SpaceShipTwo craft exploded at 45,000ft not long after igniting its engines, which were using a new rocket fuel for the first time. The disaster over California's Mojave Desert also left another pilot, who managed to parachute out of the space plane, in hospital with serious injuries. Explosion: The Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo exploded at 45,000ft today over the Mojvae Desert, California . Moments before: The spacecraft had just fired its engines after detaching from the WhiteKnightTwo launching craft . Space plane: There had been complications developing the proper fuel system for SpaceShipTwo - and experts say engine troubles are probably behind the explosion . Investigators have yet to decide what caused the accident, but experts have said engine problems are the most likely cause . In the wake of the disaster reports emerged telling how a test engine blew up in 2007, killing three people. It has also emerged that one of Virgin's star pilots, who left the company for a competitor, had characterized the solid rocket fuel used until recent as being unstable during tests. The SpaceShipTwo vessel, which is carried to 45,000ft by a separate airplane before turning its own engines on, is propelled by a mixture of two fuels, a liquid and a solid. Before each flight it is loaded up with a tank of pressurized nitrous oxide and a separate, solid fuel, which are mixed when the engine ignites. Until the latest flight, SpaceShipTwo had used hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) - a type of rubber - as the solid component. 2007 disaster: A test of liquid nitrous oxie fuel in the Mojave Desert in 2007 killed three people working on the Virgin Galactic engines. Picture is the aftermath . But for the most recent launch they swapped to a polyamide grain fuel - a type of plastic - which had been tested on the ground but not on board SpaceShipTwo before. The first disaster in the fuel history of Virgin Galactic came in 2007, when an early version of the nitrous oxide liquid fuel tank exploded, killing three workers. The blast, at an outdoor test facility belonging to partner company Scaled Composites, killed employees Todd Ivens, Eric Blackwell and Charles May, who were watching the test from behind a chain link fence. Concerns: Pilot Brian Binnie, who used to be part of Virgin Galactic, spoke of 'instabilities' in solid fuels . It was a 'cold flow' experiment, which means the fuel was not ignited. The incident prompted a thorough redesign of the tank, and also led to a $28,000 fine for Scaled Composites. The cause has never been determined. However, years later it was the solid part of the fuel mix which was a cause for concern from those close to the project. Brian Binnie, who piloted SpaceShipOne - an earlier model of the plane - had mentioned 'instabilities' in the solid fuel - at that time HTPB. In an interview with popularmechanics.com, he said of the solid fuel source: 'It was full of instabilities initially. We had startup instabilities and we had end-of-burn instabilities . In their efforts to fix the problem, the engineers 'did everything but break down and pray to God to show us the light of day.' Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides announced the switch to the plastic fuel earlier this year, saying it performed better than HTPB and could send the rocket even higher. Though the investigation into the crash's causes is expected to take weeks, experts have said engine trouble is the most probable cause. Speaking to the New Scientist,  Richard Osborne, chair of the British Interplanetary Society Technical Committee, said: 'I just cannot see that anything else [but engine failure] would result in the amount of damage.' 'I have been saying now since about 2008, 2009, that motor's a mistake. 'They should go with a liquid. I've not wavered in that. It's very very sad to see this happen.' The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board (NSTB) have both announced investigations into the crash, with which Virgin Galactic has said it will co-operate fully.","Explosion in Mojave desert seven years ago was testing rocket fuel .

"The number of people  living to 100 in the UK has increased by 71 per cent in the last ten years, and has shot up more than five-fold since the Eighties. There are now more than half a million people aged 90 and above living in this country, with nearly 14,000 of them aged more than 100, compared to just 2,500 in 1980. There are also 710 people who have lived beyond their 105th birthday, up from 340 ten years ago. The number of people aged 100 and over has increased by 71 per cent in the last ten years to nearly 14,000, including 710 people aged more than 105 . There are also more than 500,000 people aged 90 and above living in the UK, according to new estimates . In 1983, for every 100,000 members of the public there were 322 people aged 90 and over, and by 2013 this had soared to 822 per 100,000 people in the UK. The Department for Work and Pensions centenarian team, based in Newcastle, contacts people approaching their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday. As the number of people reaching the landmark birthday increases, the team has now expanded from a single person to a team of seven. Team leader Margaret Wilberforce-Eke said: 'We get to speak to some fascinating people with some amazing stories about their lives over the last century. 'We hear about people celebrating their big days with street parties, hot air balloon rides, trips of a lifetime abroad, and even a pool party. Life expectancy for men born this year is now 78, compared with 82 for women . 'Playing a part in their celebrations is really rewarding and we look forward to helping thousands of people have a happy 100th birthday this year.' Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith added: 'It is a privilege to send these cards and help the hundreds of people each year celebrate their special birthday. 'Our ageing society can only be a cause for celebration and our reforms to pensions are ensuring the system can stay strong as the number of people in Britain hitting 100 ‘not out’ increases.' Data released by the Office for National Statistics today also showed  life expectancy has increased again, with the gap between the sexes continuing to close. Men born this year can expect to live to 78, while women will reach 82 on average. That is compared to just 70 for men born between 1980 and 1982, and 76 for women. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: 'Having nearly 14,000 centenarians in the UK is a cause for real celebration, and while an ageing population does present some new challenges, it is something to be embraced, not feared. 'We do need to invest in the services needed to help older people stay fit and well. Our creaking social care system has been chronically underfunded for years and will simply not be able to cope with the level of need that an ageing population will bring unless substantially more money is found. 'There are still huge disparities in healthy life expectancy across the country, meaning that not only are the poorest socio-economic groups dying almost a generation earlier than those living the longest but they also live more years with disability. 'This just demonstrates that it's not the length of someone's life that creates the need for services but their health and wellbeing in those years, for which we can all make a difference. 'We also need to create age-friendly communities that offer a good quality of life across the generations, by designing environments that are safe and pleasant to live in, with good local facilities and open spaces. 'If we can get this right, it will help to sustain the health, wellbeing and quality of life for everyone, regardless of age.'","Life expectancy increases to 78 for men born this year and 82 for women .

"Not the dad: Carnell Alexander has DNA proof he is not the father of the child born in 1987 . A Detroit man has been ordered to pay $30,000 in child support despite not being the father. Carnell Alexander has proven in a DNA test he is not the father of the child born in 1987, but the state wants him to pay anyway - and is threatening him with prison if he does not. The situation arose when an ex-partner of Mr Alexander put him down as the father of her child in an application for financial support from the state in the late 80s, . She began receiving support, and as far as the state was concerned Mr Alexander was liable to pay it back. A court order was issued notifying him of his obligation to pay, and a process server assigned to deliver the notice told the court he had done so but that Mr Alexander had refused to sign a receipt. But Mr Alexander was in prison for an unrelated crime at the time the order was supposedly delivered, and he never received it. He had no idea about the paternity suit until he was stopped by a traffic officer in the early 1990s, who discovered Mr Alexander was the subject of an outstanding warrant for failing to pay paternity. ‘I knew I didn’t have a child, so I was kind of blown back,’ Mr Alexander told 7 Action News. Mr Alexander has been trying to fight the paternity suit ever since. Mr Alexander claims that before the arrest, he had never heard of the court order, let alone of the child. The long legal process involved Mr Alexander tracking down the mother of the child and getting a DNA test that proved his innocence. The mother told the TV channel that she had no idea the state was pursuing Mr Alexander, and that she had only put her ex-boyfriend’s name down as the father in a desperate attempt to get state assistance. She says she did not realise the state would go after the father, in this case the falsely accused Mr Alexander, over the payments. Pay up or get locked down: Michigan State judge says biological fatherhood is irrelevant as they claim Mr Alexander refused to sign a court order to pay child support - which was delivered to his home while he was in prison . The mother of the child has since gone to the court to ask that the debt owed to her personally - totalling $70,000 - be forgiven. This was granted, but a judge still demands the other half, about $30,000 which is owed to the state, is paid back. Mr Alexander has refused and is now being threatened with jail time. ‘I feel like I’m standing in front of a brick wall with nowhere to go,’ Mr Alexander told the TV channel.","Carnell Alexander has been ordered to pay support for child born in 1987 .

"Mo Farah put a wretched 2014 behind him by completing the long-distance double at the European Championships. Things have gone off kilter since the 31-year-old became just the second man in history to complete an Olympic and world 'double-double' in the distance events. Farah was disappointed by his display at the London Marathon and frustrated further when illness forced him to miss the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Upon arriving in Zurich this week, he revealed the full extent of the health concerns which made him an absentee in Scotland - he said he had collapsed in his bathroom and had to be airlifted to hospital due to concerns over his heart. That illness gave him extra incentive to succeed in a competition which witnessed his long-distance breakthrough in 2010.

"It seems appropriate that the American city famed for its heat should stage a match between English football’s most fierce rivals. The suggestion that the Miami final of this International Champions Cup, contested by Manchester United and Liverpool, will be a friendly affair seems wishful. For each team it marks an opportunity to flex muscles and score an early boost ahead of the season proper. For once, United will enter from the more humble position with Liverpool looking down. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney and Van Gaal's tight embrace during training . Tactical genius: New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has imposed a 5-3-2 formation on his team . But there is a new manager in the Old Trafford dugout and initial indications are Louis Van Gaal may have the charisma and ingenuity to turn the club around. Liverpool have lost Luis Suarez but Brendan Rodgers is acquiring plenty of players to compensate. Here are how the best starting line-ups currently available to either boss might look and rate. Moving on: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will be without Luis Suarez following his sale to Barcelona in July . Manchester United - Formation: 3-5-2 . July 26: Beat Roma 3-2 - Denver . July 29: Drew 0-0 Inter (pens win) - Landover . August 2: Beat Real Madrid 3-1  - Ann Arbor . Team Total: 83 . David de Gea - Rating 8.5 . One player to emerge from last season’s wreckage with an enhanced reputation and looks in prime nick. Capable of stunning saves and increasingly commanding of his area. Safe hands: David de Gea's unquestionable shot-stopping makes his Manchester United's No 1 . Chris Smalling - 6.5 . Has suffered from operating at right back through necessity during his time at Old Trafford but Van Gaal’s new system offers him a chance to flourish at centre back. He must take it. Up for it: Chris Smalling (left) has finally got the chance to flourish at centre-back in Louis van Gaal's team . Jonny Evans - 7 . At 26, he is now the elder statesman of United’s defence since the departures of Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra and is being considered for a captaincy role. Big responsibility on his shoulders. Veteran: At 26, Jonny Evans (left) is United's oldest and most experienced centre back . Phil Jones - 6.5 . Another who has not kicked on as hoped, partly through being shuffled around the pitch. Central defence has always looked his most natural position so now has a regular opportunity to fulfill that potential. Crunching challenge: Like Smalling, Phil Jones (left) will get a chance to shine at centre back . Antonio Valencia - 7.5 . Able to slot seamlessly into the right wing back slot by virtue of his strength, pace and stamina. One of the players you imagine Van Gaal would be able to improve in a formation that may suit. Reborn: Antonio Valencia (left) looks tailor-made for the right wing back role under Van Gaal . Luke Shaw - 7 . Must get his fitness up to peak standard before he can become the marauding wing back United desperately need. His powerful running should add dynamism to the left flank. Star in the making: United paid Southampton £31million for Luke Shaw (top) this summer . Michael Carrick - 7.5 . Ankle injury will rule him out for the opening weeks of the season but once back will bring much-required experience and link from defence to attack. Van Gaal wants his players to be rounded individuals and he fits that mould. Early blow: Michael Carrick will miss the start of United's season after undergoing ankle surgery . Ander Herrera - 8 . Has shown in an impressive pre-season how he can provide drive and creativity from midfield. Expressive on the pitch and off it, and entering his prime at 24 years old. Baller: Ander Herrera (centre) has fitted seamlessly in United's first-team since his move from Athletic Bilbao . Juan Mata - 8.5 . United’s midfield produced an alarmingly slim amount of goals in recent years but the Spaniard seems likely to continue where he left off at the end of last season. Silky presence with cutting edge. Revitalised: Juan Mata (centre) scored in United's 3-2 pre-season win against Roma in July . Wayne Rooney - 8 . No chance of him being shifted to the left in Van Gaal’s preferred formation. Striker will be in his preferred role and that clarity could yield big results. This could be a defining season, with a manager who will neither pander nor ostracise. Point to prove: Wayne Rooney is in contention to be van Gaal's captain next season . Robin van Persie - 8 . Once recuperated from World Cup he should be back to his best under the compatriot with whom he shares a strong bond. Produced magical moments in Brazil and threatens to return to form of 2012-13. Top dog: Van Gaal's hopes Van Persie replicates his Holland World Cup form in a United shirt next season . VIDEO Van Gaal happy with squad . July 27: Beat Olympiacos 1-0 - Chicago . July 30: Drew 2-2 Man City (pens win) - New York . August 2: Beat Milan 2-0 - Charlotte . Liverpool - Formation: 4-3-3 . Team Total: 83.5 . Simon Mignolet - 6.5 . Coped reasonably well with making the step up to a club chasing the title last term but must increase his level of command. An excellent shot-stopper but is liable to mistakes howler. Step up: Simon Mignolet has to work on commanding his area in the Liverpool box . Glen Johnson - 6 . The influx of full backs, his form, and his age - 29 - combine to put his place at jeopardy. With one year left on his contract Liverpool might cash in. But as things stand he has the right-back slot. Under pressure: Glen Johnson (left) faces competition for a starting spot at right back for Liverpool . Dejan Lovren - 7.5 . Got his way with move from Southampton but now must prove worth the £20m price-tag and all the fuss. A commanding defender who could fill void left by Jamie Carragher. All smiles: Dejan Lovren joined Liverpool in a £20million transfer last month from Southampton . Mamadou Sakho - 8 . Showed enough at World Cup to suggest he could become Rodgers' No 1 centre back. Troubled by injury last season but provides pace and power as well as being comfortable on the ball. Beast: Mamadou Sakho's pace and power makes him a welcome addition to Brendan Rodgers' defence . Jon Flanagan - 7.5 . Academy graduate became a cult hero on Merseyside for his fearless displays last season but his position comes under threat from Alberto Moreno’s imminent arrival. Could switch to right back. Cult hero: Jon Flanagan (second right) endeared himself to the Kop last season with his fearless displays . Steven Gerrard - 7.5 . At 34 is spurred on by the worst three months of his career. Errors cost Liverpool and England but he will thrive on driving through Rodgers’ evolution and leading his club in Europe once more. Captain Marvel: Steven Gerrard (left) will be hoping to skipper Liverpool to their first-ever Premier League title . Jordan Henderson - 8 . A revelation last term, bringing energy, smart passing and occasional goals to Liverpool’s midfield. Despite reinforcements should keep his place as a box-to-box player. Mr Energy: Jordan Henderson's (left) box-to-box qualities make him play a pivotal role in Liverpool's midfield . Philippe Coutinho - 8.5 . A little gem of a player at the point of midfield. Operates in the spaces between the lines and, with Suarez departed, will be looked upon to provide the magic that unlocks tight defences. Clever clogs: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has hailed Philippe Coutinho (right) as the 'brain of the team' Adam Lallana - 7.5 . Has never appeared daunted in his career, be it Premier League football with Southampton or his debut for England. Now has stage to show off his talents although it will be intriguing to see how he is used. Mystery man: £25million summer signing Adam Lallana (left) will miss the start of the season through injury . Raheem Sterling - 8.5 . Emerged from dips last season to become a vital player in the run-in, capable of adapting from the wing to the middle. His decision making is improving while natural skills and speed a match for anyone. One to watch: Raheem Sterling (right) performances at Liverpool earned him a World Cup spot this summer . Daniel Sturridge- 8 . Scored the goals this time last season when Suarez was suspended and must now repeat.

"They came to pay homage to Fergus McCann but, by time up, it was bunnets doffed to Ronny Deila. All the new manager’s rhetoric on energy, tempo and speed manifested itself in the Norwegian’s first outing at Celtic Park as a much-praised Dundee United side were blown away by a performance worthy of champions. The cheers that greeted Deila’s team at the interval and the final whistle were palpably louder than experienced at a domestic fixture here in some time — and McCann has to take his share of the credit for helping to shape the mood. Instant impact: Jason Denayer scored in his first game for Celtic after just four minutes . Double trouble: Kris Commons celebrates doubling Celtic's lead as the Bhoys thrashed Dundee United . Celtic: Gordon, Ambrose Emuobo, Izaguirre, Mulgrew, Van Dijk, Denayer, McGregor (Forrest 69), Johansen (Kayal 45), Stokes (Griffiths 70), Commons, Berget . Subs not used: Biton, Boerrigter, Zaluska . Dundee United: Cierzniak, Watson, Townsend, Rankin,  Morris, Fojut, Mackay-Steven (Spittal 75), Paton, Ciftci, Armstrong (Bilate 40), Dow (Erskine 57) Subs not used: Graham, McCallum, Telfer, Smith . Ref: Craig Thomson . Att:44,484 . Once booed in the act of raising a championship flag at Celtic Park, history has been kind to the club’s returning saviour and he was suitably cheered to the rafters. He responded with a raised thumb before addressing the crowd thus: ‘What an honour it is to be here — just to be here at Celtic Park with you. Things can go up, and things can go down. ‘Celtic, I hope, will go on forever. Three years as champions is something to celebrate.’ After unfurling the flag, he conducted the crowd in a rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone while making his way across the pitch to his seat in the North Stand, the first section of the ground restructured under his revolutionary stewardship. They were selling McCann’s trademark headgear in the club store and, as the crowd revelled in their tribute, the current chief executive, Peter Lawwell, could put away his tin hat as the supporters’ protestation at his own frugal stewardship was put on ice. It helps, of course, when the team is functioning so well. Yes, United were abject and never came close to delivering on the promise of the back-to-back victories claimed at the start of this season. That'll do nicely: Stefan Johansen makes it 3-0 wiith a well-taken finish before half-time . With five different players on the scoresheet including home debut goals for Jason Denayer and Jo Inge Berget, Deila’s team were a delight. In Anthony Stokes, they had the game’s best performer, even if the Irishman would have been disappointed to depart the fray without netting a goal. Now in his seventies, McCann looks frailer than the figure who rescued the club from bankruptcy 20 years ago, but he also seemed relaxed and having more fun as he enjoyed a rare trip from Canada. He was still posing for photographs as both teams came within inches of opening the scoring. Callum McGregor tried first, striking the post from distance and then Efe Ambrose, included at right-back after Adam Matthews sustained a calf injury in the warm-up, was shrugged off by Stuart Armstrong, who found Gary Mackay-Steven with an exquisite pass marginally more precise than the finish, which crept wide. Captain fantastic: Charlie Mulgrew wheels away after making it 4-0 in the second half . United clearly fancied their chances of maintaining their 100-per-cent start to the season but, sprightly as they were, their inability to defend a corner-kick made the result certain before half an hour had passed. Denayer printed his name on the scoresheet when Callum Morris headed Kris Commons’ corner straight into the on-loan debutant’s path. Denayer has been recruited from Manchester City to stop goals but he conjured an instinctive finish that arrowed into the top corner. The second goal was even more straightforward, Stokes providing the set-piece cross and Commons enjoying the novelty of a headed goal to open his account this season. No 3 came from open play but featured the same level of United ineptitude. Morris again contributed with a slack pass to Paul Paton, who delayed too long on the ball, allowing Stefan Johansen to nip in and shoot past Radoslaw Cierzniak. Brace: Jo Inge Berget scored twice after the interval to add further gloss to the scoreline . United were actually lucky to go in three behind. Stokes could have bagged a hat-trick as he peppered Cierzniak’s goal, while Berget shook the goal-frame to its foundations with a powerful drive. Craig Gordon started his first competitive game in over two years at St Johnstone in midweek and continued with the same calm authority, saving at the feet of Nadir Ciftci early on and then turning the same player’s shot wide following Charlie Mulgrew’s lapse after the break. The stand-in captain made amends as he glanced home Stokes’s free-kick for the fourth and then Berget got in on the act, nodding in from close range after Stokes’ corner was headed across goal by Ambrose. John Rankin pulled a goal back with a deflected shot but a rapid counter-attack saw Celtic restore the five-goal advantage. Substitutes James Forrest and Beram Kayal were the creators, the Israeli’s overlap resulting in a cross to the back post where Berget squeezed home his finish. After the trauma of Legia Warsaw, Deila no longer need cringe at the mention of a 6-1 scoreline.","Debutant Jason Denayer put the hosts in front after just four minutes .

"Discarded cigarette waste may be a blight on our streets, but researchers are hoping they could someday repurpose it into something useful. So far, studies have looked into how cigarettes can power mobile phones, make shipping pallets and create stronger concrete. Now a group of Chinese scientists has come up with a method of using cigarette ash to filter dangerous arsenic from water supplies. A group of Chinese scientists has come up with a method of using cigarette ash to filter dangerous arsenic from water supplies . Arsenic, a well-known poison, can be taken out of drinking water using sophisticated treatment methods. But in places that lack the equipment or technical know-how required to remove it, it still laces drinking water and makes people sick. A team, led by Jiaxing Li of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, coated cigarette ash with aluminium oxide. Arsenic, a well-known poison, can be taken out of drinking water using sophisticated treatment methods. But in places that lack the equipment or technical know-how required to remove it, it still laces drinking water and makes people sick . Because it has a porous consistency, they suspected that the ash would be better at filtering arsenic than other materials that have been tried previously, such as banana peels. When they tested the material with contaminated ground water, they found it removed more than 96 per cent of the arsenic, reducing its levels to below the standard set by the World Health Organisation. Naturally occurring and industry-related arsenic contaminates groundwater at high levels in many countries, including Chile, China, Hungary and Mexico. Worldwide, around 5.6 trillion used-cigarettes, or 766,571 tonnes, of used cigarettes are flicked onto pavements each year . Researchers from South Korea believe they can convert cigarette filters into a material that could be used by computers, electrical vehicles and wind turbines to store energy. This material can be used to coat the electrodes of supercapacitors, which are components that can store extremely large amounts of electrical energy . The researchers claim the material's performance is even better that the commercially available carbon, graphene and carbon nanotubes currently used to do the same job. Worldwide, around 5.6 trillion used-cigarettes, or 766,571 tonnes, of used cigarettes are flicked onto pavements each year. That's equivalent to the weight of 380 London Eyes. Co-author of the study Professor Jongheop Yi, from Seoul National University, said: 'Our study has shown that used-cigarette filters can be transformed into a high-performing carbon-based material using a simple one step process, which simultaneously offers a green solution to meeting the energy demands of society. The odourless, tasteless element can cause skin discolouration, stomach pain, partial paralysis and a range of other serious health problems. While the technology for removing arsenic from water exists, it is expensive and impractical for rural and developing regions. Because cigarette ashes are discarded in countries around the world and can be easily collected in places where public smoking is allowed, it could be part of a low-cost solution for a serious public health issue, they claim.","Arsenic laces water in countries including Chile, China and Mexico .

"Tony Pulis was locked in a crisis meeting with Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish on Thursday night in a row over the club’s transfer policy. Pulis, who kept Palace in the Barclays Premier League last season after taking over when they had just four points, threatened to quit. Although the Palace chief took training as usual on Thursday as he prepared for Saturday's opening fixture with Arsenal, Parish called him into a meeting at a central London location.

Plenty to shout about: Tony Pulis is unhappy with the transfer policy at Crystal Palace . Talking tactics: Tony Pulis gives Marouane Chamakh some direction during the friendly against Augsburg . The pair’s relationship has deteriorated again over the summer over a difference of opinion in the type of players they want to recruit at Selhurst Park. Pulis took over at Palace last season when the club had just four points, but they staged a remarkable recovery in the second phase of the season to finish 11th. The former Stoke manager wanted to be backed heavily in the summer transfer window, but Parish has a cautious approach because of the finance involved. Palace have twice gone into administration under different owners because of a catastrophic transfer policy under former chairman Mark Goldberg and, more recently, under Simon Jordan.

Parish, who is one of four Palace fans who own a 25 per cent share each in the club, does not want to overstretch the budget. Pulis is convinced he needs new players, but he has become increasingly frustrated over the summer by the failure to land any of his main targets. He believed he had put together deals for Steven Caulker, Michu and Gylfi Sigurdsson when the season came to an end. Instead Caulker signed for QPR, Michu joined Rafa Benitez at Napoli and Sigurdsson returned to Swansea from Tottenham. Pulis wants total control of the club’s recruitment policy, but Parish is reluctant to let the manager be in sole charge of player trading.","Pulis now bookies second favourite manger to leave his job .

"No sooner had they paid £31.9million to sign Eliaquim Mangala than Manchester City were announcing David Silva’s new five-year contract on Tuesday. Silva will not be the only player to agree new terms at the Etihad in the weeks ahead — with Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany expected to be next. Mangala is City’s sixth signing of the summer and by far their most expensive. And if anyone missed it, Frank Lampard has joined the Barclays Premier League champions as well. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Silva signs new five-year City deal . Shhh! Manuel Pellegrini has been quietly going about his business at Manchester City . Not so long ago... It could be easy to forget that Manchester City won the title only last season . A tale of two Cities: Champions can field two world class sides at training . Amid all the headlines and hype this summer, it would be easy to forget that City won the title race last season. Louis van Gaal’s arrival across town at Manchester United has understandably commanded huge interest, while Chelsea and Liverpool have emerged as the biggest spenders in the transfer market. Arsenal, still dizzy on their FA Cup triumph in May, made what was seen as a statement of intent by comfortably beating the champions 3-0 in the Community Shield last weekend. But if all that is meant to set alarm bells ringing at City, they aren’t paying too much attention. ‘We’re not really here,’ has become a popular ditty in the blue half of Manchester in recent years and never has it been more appropriate than now. Manuel Pellegrini was brought in to do his talking on the pitch, and any reporter who has tried to get a headline out of the Chilean over the course of the last year knows just how well he has succeeded. The antithesis of his predecessor Roberto Mancini, Pellegrini is only interested in silverware not soundbites and he expects the same from his players. Yaya Toure’s bizarre ‘cake-gate’ saga aside, the days of star players like Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli kicking up a fuss, or routinely being pictured kicking one another around the training pitch, are in the past. Nothing sums up Pellegrini’s City better than their pre-season movements this summer. They started with a week in Scotland and, you suspect, the manager would happily have stayed there rather than travel to America. But while United were providing the headline act in Los Angeles and playing Real Madrid in front of a 109,000 sellout crowd in Michigan, City were flying under the radar in Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis. Staying power: Spain playmaker David Silva has signed a new five-year contract at the Etihad . VIDEO Silva signs new five-year City deal . American boy: Frank Lampard has joined City on a short-term loan ahead of his move to the MLS . Even when they appeared at Yankee Stadium, it was opponents Liverpool who drew significantly more support from the New York public. That will not worry Pellegrini. Nor will he be unduly concerned by Sunday’s defeat to Arsenal at Wembley. City were missing no fewer than seven World Cup players and that does not include Mangala, now officially the most expensive defender in the history of British football. It is worth noting that Pellegrini’s side lost 3-1 to Arsenal in Helsinki on the same weekend last year and still went on to win a Premier League and Capital One Cup double. City have built on that success, paying FC Porto £44m to sign Mangala and his teammate Fernando. Willy Caballero has been brought in to provide stiffer competition for England goalkeeper Joe Hart. Bacary Sagna arrived as a free agent from Arsenal and Lampard from Chelsea, albeit via New York. Early days Manchester City got off to a losing start after defeat to Arsenal in the FA Community Shield . It wasn’t just the offer of a new £170,000-a-week deal that convinced Silva to commit himself to City until 2019 yesterday, becoming the latest player after Aleksandar Kolarov and Samir Nasri to sign a new contract. ‘Over the last four years we have achieved so much together, establishing City as a dominating force in England and now, when I look around this dressing-room, I can see no reason why we won’t become one of the top teams in the world,’ said Spain’s Silva. ‘It was a straightforward decision to extend my stay here and spend my peak years at Manchester City. Why wouldn’t I want to stay and keep winning trophies with this fantastic team?’ With City’s relatively conservative spending in the transfer market this summer forced upon them by UEFA, there will be outgoings. Exit strategy: Jack Rodwell could be one of many players leaving City after his departure to Sunderland . Jack Rodwell has been sold to Sunderland and Javi Garcia is on the verge of joining Zenit St Petersburg for £12m. Matija Nastasic, Scott Sinclair and Micah Richards could all follow. Even then, Pellegrini would have one foreigner too many for his Champions League quota meaning that Alvaro Negredo — sidelined until the end of next month with a fractured metatarsal — could be left out of the squad for Europe.

"Ancient Britons had far less gum disease during Roman occupation than people today. Evidence of the disease on ancient skulls is pictured . Ancient Britons had far less gum disease during Roman occupation, 1,800 years ago, than people today - even though there was little dental care, experts claim. Just five per cent of 300 skulls examined, which date between 200AD to 400AD, showed signs of severe periodontitis, or gum disease, which affects three in 10 people today. Experts believe that modern habits such as smoking are responsible for the decline in the nation’s gum health. Professor Francis Hughes, of King’s College London, said: ‘We were very struck by the finding severe gum disease appeared to be much less common in the Roman-British population than in modern humans - despite the fact that they did not use toothbrushes or visit dentists as we do today. ‘Gum disease has been found in our ancestors including in mummified remains in Egypt - and was alluded to in writings by the Babylonians, Assyrians and Sumerians as well as the early Chinese.’ Gum disease is the result of a chronic inflammatory response to the build-up of dental plaque. Much of the population lives with a mild form but factors such as smoking or medical conditions like diabetes can trigger more severe chronic gum disease, which can lead to the loss of teeth. Experts believe that modern habits such as smoking (stock image) are responsible for the decline in the nation’s gum health. Theya Molleson, of the Natural History Museum, said: ‘This study shows a major deterioration in oral health between Roman times and modern England . Professor Hughes said: ‘One of the main reasons for doing the study was the realisation in recent years that a lot of periodontal disease was associated with smoking and to a lesser extent diabetes, and although oral hygiene is obviously important it wasn’t the only factor that contributed to destructive periodontal disease. ‘This study was a way of looking at the reverse of modern causative factors - poor oral hygiene but less other contributory factors such as smoking and diabetes.’ The research, published in the British Dental Journal, examined 303 skulls from a Romano-British burial ground in Poundbury in Dorset for evidence of dental disease. While instances of gum disease in the Romano-British skulls was low, many of them showed signs of infections and abscesses - and half had tooth decay.

Experts believe that modern habits such as smoking are responsible for the decline in the nation’s gum health. The ancient population also showed extensive tooth wear from a young age, caused by a diet rich in coarse grains and cereals. ‘Some tooth decay was seen in many of the population - the main difference of this to modern populations was that this was typically confide to one or 2 teeth, whereas it is more widespread in the mouth today,’ Professor Hughes said. ‘Quite a lot of infection also arose because of the severe tooth wear resulted on occasions in exposure of the dental pulp - the dental nerve inside the tooth - and this would be a very predictable way of getting chronic infections’ The Poundbury cemetery community was made up of countryside dwellers as well as a Romanised urban population. This was a non-smoking population and likely to have had very low levels of diabetes. Gum disease is the result of a chronic inflammatory response to the build-up of dental plaque. This magnified photo shows an accumulation of bacterial plaque and the early formation of calcified tartar . Among the people who survived infancy, childhood illnesses and malnutrition into adulthood, the average age seems to be 40, with infectious diseases believed to have been the reason for death. Theya Molleson, of the Natural History Museum, said: ‘This study shows a major deterioration in oral health between Roman times and modern England. ‘By underlining the probable role of smoking - especially in determining the susceptibility to progressive periodontitis - in modern populations there is a real sign that the disease can be avoided. ‘As smoking declines in the population we should see a decline in the prevalence of the disease.’","Gum disease is a chronic inflammatory response to the build-up of plaque .

"A year ago Jacqueline Sparks was healthy, pregnant and looking forward to becoming a mother for the first time. Now she is a 27-year-old going through menopause and feeling ashamed that she can never give her husband the large family they both desperately wanted. Ms Sparks lost her daughter Mia and her ability to ever have a family naturally when a drug-affected driver crashed into the car she was travelling in with her two brothers. 'What makes it worse is I have this guilt that I'm holding [my husband] back from having a family, because he'd make such a wonderful dad, but it's not my fault,' Ms Sparks told Daily Mail Australia. Jacqueline Sparks lost her unborn baby and her ability to have children in a horrific car accident . On September 30 last year she was travelling in the front passenger's seat of her brother's car on the Princes Highway at Dapto in Wollongong, NSW, when Marco Paulo Silvestri crashed head-on into the vehicle as he tried to overtake another car. Ms Sparks was air-lifted to Liverpool Hospital following the incident where doctors discovered the extent of her injuries: head trauma, broken ribs, fractured ulna, lacerations to the bone, punctured lungs, lost vision and the 'loss of her 32 week foetus'. The car crash was so severe her womb catastrophically ruptured upon impact and had to be removed. In local court earlier this year, Silvestri pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, the Illawarra Mercury reported. In a hearing in the district court in Sutherland on Wednesday, a victim impact statement read out on behalf of Ms Sparks described the pain she felt when she realised she had lost her daughter Mia. She was injured when drug-affected driver Marco Paulo Silvestri crashed into the car she was travelling in Wollongong, NSW last year . Ms Sparks' brother Tim McNamara (left) was driving the car at the time of the accident . 'I do not remember understanding nor being told what had happened but I do remember a single tear falling from my face onto the perfect little nose of my lifeless daughter in my arms,' she wrote. 'I have lost my daughter, my womanhood and my chance to ever become a mother naturally.' Ms Sparks, from Farmborough Heights in southwest Wollongong, feels angry at Silvestri for taking those things away. 'As remorseful as he did seem yesterday, everyone's remorseful after the act,' she said. 'If you get caught doing something you feel sorry. 'How many times before that had he driven on drugs?' Ms Sparks also feels upset that he was charged with dangerous driving and not manslaughter. 'It's frustrating with driving charges, it's seen as an accident it's not seen as a crime, but the car's a weapon as well,' she said. Ms Sparks hopes to see a bill known as Zoe's Law passed through NSW Parliament, which would criminalise grievous bodily harm to a foetus of 20 weeks or more. The bill is named after Brodie Donegan's unborn daughter Zoe, who died at 32 weeks when she was hit by a drug-affected driver in 2009. Ms Sparks said her husband Chi Nguyen was devastated by the accident as the couple were looking forward to raising a large family together . But due to the accident Ms Sparks can no longer naturally give birth to children, and is already going through menopause at just 27 . In November 2013 the bill passed through the NSW Legislative Assembly 63 votes to 23, but it has yet to be introduced to the NSW Upper House. The controversial bill has faced strong opposition over concerns about the implications it would have for women seeking abortions. Ms Sparks just hopes to prevent other women from suffering in the way that she has. 'I know [Silvestri] won't be charged for manslaughter now but if it does happen again I think it's an important thing to realise it was a child,' she said. 'I just think a baby should be recognised as a baby and that person should be charged with something more.' Ms Sparks said the crash has devastated her husband Chi Nguyen. 'We both come from a big family - I come from four and he's from ten – and we both want a big family,' she said. 'If we do have to go into commercial surrogacy we're going to need literally $1 million to have four children.' And even if they choose to pursue surrogacy, they will face a number of obstacles including finding a surrogate and confirming that Ms Sparks can still produce eggs. The 27-year-old hopes to see a bill known as Zoe's Law passed through NSW Parliament, which would criminalise grievous bodily harm to a foetus of 20 weeks or more . The crash had a major impact on Ms Sparks' family, pictured here are her brother Tim (left) who was driving the car, sister Jo, brother Jonathan who was a passenger, and her mum (right) 'I'm 27 and I'm going through menopause, it's ridiculous,' she said. 'Plus all these issues around Thailand surrogacy, surrogacy in NSW is illegal and for us to even have that option we'd have to consider overseas.' Ms Sparks said the crash has also affected her social life, especially at an age where many friends are getting married and having children. 'People don't really know how to be around you, they wonder if they should give their baby to you to hold or is that insensitive,' she said. 'Some of my best friends have recently had babies and I avoid it, I feel like I'm putting an awkwardness on them.' Her brothers Jonathan Sparks, 25, and Tim McNamara, 29, have also been severely affected by the crash. Mr Sparks' spine was crushed and he will never again be able to bend over or lift more than 15kg, which has had a major impact on his career as a chef. Ms Sparks also revealed the impact the loss of her only daughter had on her own life, and the difficultly she faces while her friends are all having children of their own . Mr McNamara feels guilty as he was the one driving the car. 'I know he's really depressed, he hasn't found work,' Ms Sparks said. 'Being the driver you have guilt like you could have swerved differently or braked sooner, even though it's not his fault at all.' On Tuesday this week, exactly one year after the crash, Ms Sparks and Mr Nguyen bought Mia a birthday cake and reflected on what life would have been like if she was there with them. In court on Wednesday, defence lawyer Bill Whitby read out apology to Ms Sparks and her brothers on behalf of Silvestri. He was remanded in custody until Judge Paul Conlon hands down his sentence on October 22. But Ms Sparks finds the apology difficult to accept. 'Your actions have completely changed my life. I feel like a different person - mentally and physically. My happiness, my career, my self-esteem, my social interaction, my sleep, my energy, my laughter and above all, our daughter, is now gone,' she wrote in her victim impact statement. 'You chose to take drugs and you chose to drive dangerously. This is our life now and you gave us no choice.'","Jacqueline Sparks lost her unborn daughter and her ability to fall pregnant .

"The stadium announcer cleared his throat, took a sharp intake of breath and giddily announced: ‘Welcome to the start of a new era at the home of the world’s greatest football club, the home of Manchester United.’ Moments later, the players arrived onto the field but all the eyes and smartphones skewed anxiously to catch a glimpse of the new manager, Louis van Gaal, who immersed himself to almost disappear amid the hustle and bustle. There was no grand entrance, no banners draped over the Stretford End, no aeroplanes flying low over the Old Trafford skyline. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney selected to lead Red Devils' revival . Give him a hand: Louis van Gaal took charge of his first game at Old Trafford . Normal service resumed: The Dutchman restored a sense of order at the Theatre of Dreams . Meet and greet: The Manchester United manager is swamped by fans ahead of the game . This was a quiet and confident entrance from Louis van Gaal. Suited up in United colours, he strode purposefully down the touchline carrying a folder, offering a regal wave to the supporters and flashing a wide grin to the cameras vying for his attention. Just another day at work for the 63-year-old who has managed European powerhouses Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Afterwards, he allowed himself to indulge a little, lauding his first evening at Old Trafford as a ‘fantastic’ experience and smiling when this last-gasp win was compared to the Sir Alex Ferguson victories of yesteryear. Before the match, it was business as usual. As is habit for Van Gaal, he wandered out to observe his players pre-match warm-up, focusing the minds on the challenge ahead. As he shuffled across the Old Trafford pitch to take pride of place in front of the Sir Alex Ferguson stands, Thin Lizzy’s 1976 classic The Boys are back in town echoed out out the speakers, the air-horns sounded and Old Trafford bellowed its approval. Time for the hairdryer? Louis van Gaal follows his players into the dressing room at half-time . Right hand man: Louis van Gaal and assistant Ryan Giggs (L) watch the game from the dugout . VIDEO Rooney selected to lead Red Devils' revival . It feels an age since since this famous old stadium has felt such a contented place. As the players performed their stretches and shuttle-rins, the warm ovation was born out of affection, rather than anxiety, as was so often the case during those fraught days under David Moyes last season. When the players walked back into the dressing room, Van Gaal followed behind, waving either arm in the air and giving a high-five to Fred the Red as he entered the tunnel. It was that sort of night at Old Traford. As the action began, Van Gaal reclined into that red leather chair, worn-in for so many years by Ferguson and vacated after just 10 months by Moyes. Moyes, in truth, could never really sit still, taking sanctuary on the touchline and gesticulating furiously to his players. That, to be fair, is his style of management but there is no question that United players welcome a return to the Sir Alex model, offering trust to the players and stern rebukes only when necessary. Fletch lives! Darren Fletcher opened the scoring for United in the second half . Hair raising! United misfit Marouane Fellaini scored a late winner despite being linked with a move . Van Gaal barely ventured to the dugout, instead scribbling notes on his pad, ready to correct United’s faults in the more tranquil surroundings of the dressing room. In the stands, a host of United players watched on, dressed immaculately in club suits. Nicky Butt, the Under 21 coach, accompanied injured players Luke Shaw, Jonny Evans, Danny Welbeck and Michael Carrick in the directors box, along with those overlooked such as Nani and Will Keane. Robin van Persie remains a little short of fitness and he sat close to young James Wilson, invited to be a part of the senior group after four goals in the Manchester Senior Cup final against Manchester City last week. When they went to depart before the half-time whistle, they moved as a group, uniformed and orderly, clearly on the instructions of Van Gaal. Get used to it: Louis van Gaal waves to fans as he leaves the pitch following United's 2-1 victory . This friendly game had been branded as REUNITED by the United marketing department in the days leading and after the fractious outpourings of the past 12 months, it seemed rather fitting.

"Swansea City have completed the £8million signing of Federico Fernandez from Napoli. The centre-half wrapped up a medical in Wales this week and has signed a four-year contract, becoming the Welsh club's most expensive defensive signing.

Speaking in anticipation of the move, Williams said: ‘I saw a little bit of him on TV during the World Cup when he was playing for Argentina, but that's about it. ‘So I'll be doing what the fans do – checking out all his clips on YouTube. ‘All I can say is that, if he's been playing at for teams as good as Napoli and Argentina, then he is bound to be a good player. ‘We need to strengthen the squad because it's going to be a long, difficult season ahead - just as the others have been.’ Storming summer: Fernandez was part of the Argentina squad which reached the World Cup final . Napoli have signed Holland midfielder Jonathan De Guzman after allowing Argentina defender Fernandez to move to South Wales.

Arsenal club secretary David Miles said: 'It's nice we have got the second leg at home. They (the playoff ties) come relatively early in the season, and our three German World Cup winners won't even be back, or will be just starting training then, so probably we won't have the full squad to choose from, Nevertheless, we've got a good squad, quality in depth and I'm sure will be okay.' Meanwhile, Celtic were dramatically reinstated into the competition on Friday morning after it was revealed Legia Warsaw fielded an ineligible player.

"After Manchester United's Premier League opening defeat to Swansea on Saturday, the murmurs of discontent from the Old Trafford support over the Glazer family's lack of investment in the squad are growing ever louder. With 12 days remaining in the transfer window, many feel Louis van Gaal's squad is short of the quality required if they are to contend again for the Premier League title. But just how does United's spending this summer compare to the previous five? Some of you may be surprised. VIDEO Scroll down for Shaw and Herrera on target in Manchester United training . 2014 . Ander Herrera (midfielder) Former club: Athletic Bilbao . Fee: £29m . After a failed attempt in 2013, United finally captured the signing of Spaniard Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao in June. The 24-year-old was van Gaal's first signing, although he first came to the attention of the club more than three years ago through Sir Alex Ferguson's brother Martin. New kid on the block: Spaniard Ander Herrera was Louis van Gaal's first signing from Athletic Bilbao in June . Luke Shaw (defender) Former club: Southampton . Fee: £31.5m . England defender Luke Shaw became the world's most expensive teenager when he joined United in June.

"Forests can typically take around 100 years to reach maturity, if they're left to their own devices. But one eco-entrepreneur has managed to make the process ten times faster, creating green areas that are 30 times denser than a traditional forest. Shubhendu Sharma, from Uttaraskhand in India, devised his system after a chance encounter with Japanese forester Akira Miyawaki. Shubhendu Sharma (pictured), from Uttaraskhand in India has developed a system that allows forests to be grown ten times faster than traditional forests . Mr Sharma was working at carmaker Toyota when he signed up as for a Miyawaki-led programme to create a green space for the company. He believed he could standardise the process to make the forest cost just over £500 ($800) - or around the cost of an iPhone. By combining Mr Miyawaki's knowledge with his efficiency of industrial processes he managed to transform a 1,000 square foot (93 square metre) plot into a lush, green area. The process involves analysing the soil to find out what species of tree will grow best in the area. Saplings, which can reach up to 2ft 7 inches (80cm) high, are then planted, with three to five saplings per square metre.

In just two years of planting in his own garden, Mr Sharma had 300 trees, 42 species, of which 18 bore fruit, and 17 species of bird in an area where there had previously just been two. 'Our guava trees produce so much fruit that we harvest at least 5kg [11lb] a day. 'All my neighbours are getting guava nectar because we have such an abundance,' Mr Sharma told Jane Wakefield at the BBC. Mr Sharma now has his own company, Afforestt, which has, so far, planted 43,000 trees for 33 clients based in India.

'Our plan is to automate the system so that we can give anyone anywhere in the world step-by-step instructions on how to plant a native forest,' Mr Sharma told Ted blogs. 'We plan to crowd source knowledge of native tree species; I'm working on a website for this part of the project, and plan to launch it within a year.' To make soil analysis easy for remote clients, Mr Sharma also hopes to develop a small, GPS-enabled soil probe that will test soil and upload the data onto their servers. When the probe is integrated with our database, at the push of a button you'll know the soil constituents and what nutrients it needs, and we'll be able to immediately send a complete species list and a detailed procedure,' he said.","The process involves planting three to five saplings per square metre .

"Growing up, Cheikhou Kouyate always dreamed of following in the footsteps of his idol Patrick Vieira. His journey to London, signing for West Ham for £7million this summer, and development as a player have been so similar to the Arsenal great they could practically have worn the same shoes. Both were born in Dakar, Senegal, but travelled through Europe to gain their footballing education as teenagers in various countries before ending up in the Barclays Premier League. Vieira moved to France and then Italy before landing in England at Arsenal. Kouyate’s route was even longer. In pursuit of football he moved first to Greece, leaving his family behind, then to France and finally Belgium before he found East London this summer. Midfield man: New West Ham man Cheikhou Kouyate joined the Hammers from Anderlecht in a £7million deal . But their similarities stretch further than simple geography. They are both 6ft 4in and of a similar imposing build. Both are known on the football field for their immense physicality and tough tackling. t was not long before the comparisons came when Kouyate finally broke into the first-team at Brussels in 2007 aged 18. ‘When I started playing in Belgium I played 10 matches and people began comparing me with Patrick Vieira,’ Kouyate said. ‘It was an immense pleasure to be compared to such a fantastic player because he was a role model for us Senegalese and an inspiration. ‘When he showed how good he was, he made us dream and aspire to achieve similar things. I know it will be tough. Now it is up to me that I deserve the comparison. ‘To do that, I need to give the best to my team. I hope to achieve just a bit of what he achieved. I know it will be difficult. It is now up to me to show my qualities and play like I can.’ Idol: Kouyate has followed in the footsteps of his hero Patrick Vieira in making it to the Premier League . Thumbs up: Kouyate poses with fellow West Ham new boys Diego Poyet (left) and Mauro Zarate (centre) It was that ‘obsession,’ as Kouyate describes it, to get to England that drove him on when he felt lonely and homesick and wanted to give it all up. The first three months away from home were the hardest, but it is this experience which, he believes, gives him the mental strength for the English top flight. ‘It was so difficult that I wanted to go back to Senegal,’ he said. ‘It was the first time I had left my country without my family, I had nothing and was completely on my own. It was really cold. It was the first time I had seen snow. ‘But I spoke to my grandmother and my mum on the telephone and they told me to stay put. I was on my own a lot of the time, but I got used to it. It was then my mental strength began to increase, I became tougher.’ Big move: Kouyate moved to Belgium from Senegal and made his debut for Anderlecht at the age of 18 in 2007 . His mother and brother are getting loose ends tied up with work in Senegal but plan to move over here. There is talk of December, but they may wait until next summer so the temperature is not such a shock to the system. Luckily, through his travels, Kouyate is fully prepared for the cold, wet and windy evening and afternoon games ahead. He played with Romeleu Lukaku at Anderlecht, where he signed from this summer, and garnered advice from him. He also spoke to other Senegalese players El Hadji Diouf and Mo Diame. He added: ‘Diouf said I need to work hard, concentrate in training and that I mustn’t hold back.’ When Kouyate takes to the field at Upton Park against Tottenham this afternoon [SAT], provided he does not hold back he will be a step closer to emulating his idol.","West Ham's Cheikhou Kouyate dreamed of moving to Premier League .

"Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football... Phil Jones was one of two Manchester United players to run faster than 20mph during the Red Devils' defeat by Swansea, Gareth Barry is closing in on 100 career yellow cards while Sam Allardyce has looks to have changed his style at West Ham. 1. Louis van Gaal’s top priority in the transfer market will be to inject pace into Manchester United’s team. Apart from West Brom all the Premier League sides who played on Saturday had a player who produced a swifter sprint than Ashley Young’s top speed of 20.7mph. Top speed: Phil Jones was one of two Man United players to get over 20mph against Swansea at Old Trafford . The only other United player to get above 20mph in the EA Sports ratings was defender Phil Jones - not all that encouraging when you think the 3-5-2 system that van Gaal has brought from the World Cup relied on the searing sprints of Arjen Robben. His fastest sprint was recorded at more than 22mph. 2. Gareth Barry looks stitched on to become the Premier League’s all-time most booked player, and the first to reach a century, by the end of this season – if not sooner. The former England midfielder was lucky not to get sent off for a clumsy challenge on Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez a few minutes after getting carded for blocking Leonardo Ulloa. The yellow he did get was the 95th of his career, now just two behind Paul Scholes and four off joint record holders Kevin Davies and Lee Bowyer. In the book: Everton midfielder Gareth Barry (left) is close to picking up a century of yellow cards . 3. Kieran Richardson has spent the last four years of his career at either left back or on the left of midfield but Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert found a new job for him at Stoke. The 29-year-old played just behind the centre forward, and not only blotted Stephen Ireland out of the game but set up a chance that Gabby Agbonlahor should have put away. Richardson hasn’t played in a central role since he first moved from Manchester United to Sunderland – when Lambert’s new No 2 Roy Keane was the boss. Middle man: Kieran Richardson played just behind the centre forward for Aston Villa against Stoke . 4. Sam Allardyce is under instructions to deliver a less direct style of play at West Ham and he’s clearly following orders – despite the disappointment of losing to Tottenham. Hammers attempted 483 passes against Spurs, 150 more than they did in the same fixture at Upton Park last season. Their average number of passes per game last term was just 325. Following orders: Sam Allardyce's West Ham attempted 483 passes against Tottenham on Saturday . 5. Morgan Schneiderlin continues to be linked with Tottenham and made little secret of his desire to follow former Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino to White Hart Lane. But the French midfielder’s performance at Liverpool made sure that, in the meantime, he couldn’t be accused of failing to give his all to Saints. Schneiderlin ran 7.7 miles in the game, more than half a mile more than any other player involved at Anfield. Going the extra mile: Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin ran further than any other player during Southampton's defeat at Anfield . 6. Vincent Kompany was Manchester City’s key defender away from home last season and it doesn’t look as if this year will be too much different. The Belgium skipper made a series of blocks and tackles to help City keep a clean sheet at Newcastle as around him Gael Clichy and Martin Demichelis didn’t always look comfortable. City will worry that a hangover from the World Cup gives Kompany no fitness issues. Last season they took just four points from five away games he missed, compared with 30 from the 14 in which he played. Brave: Captain Vincent Kompany dives in to deny Newcastle frontman Ayoze Perez at St James' Park . VIDEO Pellegrini happy to escape with three points . 7. Billy Sharp could be a bargain replacement for £11million Ross McCormack at Leeds after marking his debut following a £450,000 move from Southampton with the winner against Middlesbrough. Sharp could feel hard done by for never getting a chance at Saints despite scoring nine in 11 starts after a £1.8m move from Doncaster in 2012. The 28-year-old still scored an average of a goal every three games in loan spells at Forest, Reading and back at Doncaster and his career record remains a goal in every two starts. Easy does it: Billy Sharp slides the ball home to give Leeds a 1-0 victory over Middlesbrough at Elland Road . 8. When Steve Coppell took Reading into the Premier League for the first time in 2006 the club’s chairman Sir John Madejski insisted that a large chunk of the TV cash was invested in building the club’s Academy facilities. Eight years later the decision is paying dividends. Jake Taylor, who got the winner against Ipswich, was one of 12 players in manager Nigel Adkins’ 18-man squad who have come through the system. 9. Striker Joe Garner has been struggling to reach agreement over a new contract at Preston despite top scoring last year with 24 goals. With a year to go on his current deal, and other clubs monitoring the situation, he did his case for a pay rise no harm by scoring twice in the 4-0 victory at Scunthorpe. That already takes him to three goals in two League One matches, as his agent will no doubt be pointing out to Deepdale chairman Peter Ridsdale. Earning his money: Joe Garner (right) celebrates after scoring during Preston's 4-0 win over Scunthorpe . 10. Nigel Worthington’s York players need to learn that the game lasts longer than 90 minutes these days. Marc Richards’ injury time free kick that snatched a point for Northampton was the third time in as many games in a week that York had thrown away a game by conceding late on.","Phil Jones one of only two Manchester United player to run faster than 20mph during 2-1 defeat to Swansea .

"Former Manchester City midfielder Dietmar Hamann feels the club needs to be closely monitored by UEFA as deals like the one which has taken Frank Lampard to the Etihad Stadium 'could be an issue' in the future. City were hit with sanctions by UEFA in May for breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. This month they recruited Lampard on loan until January from New York City FC - their American sister outfit, who the 36-year-old England international signed for after reaching the end of his contract with Chelsea earlier this summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger on Frank Lampard loan . Wary: Deals like Frank Lampard's loan to Manchester City 'could be an issue' in future says Dietmar Hamann . Questionable: Hamann might be a former City player but says deals like Lampard's raise FFP concerns . And Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger subsequently questioned the arrangement, saying: 'Is it a way to get around the fair play? I don't know.' Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has responded by insisting 'the rules of FFP don't have any relation' to the Lampard situation, which he says has been conducted correctly - and Hamann thinks that deal in itself is not really a problem.

"Police nabbed a woman twice in two days for allegedly possessing marijuana on two separate occasions in a Texas town. Local media reported that Youlanda Levette Whitaker allegedly stashed marijuana inside a Lufkin day care center Monday - and was out on bond before she was allegedly found with marijuana inside her car the next day. Lufkin police responded to two people 'packaging marijuana' Monday afternoon, KTRE reported. Nabbed: Youlanda Whitaker (left) allegedly hid marijuana inside a daycare center Monday, with Frederick Ruth (right)  waiting in a car outside . A Buick was observed by a Lufkin police officer at Noah's Ark Early Education Center Day Care - and that the driver 'had come out of the building and was sitting in the driver's seat with the door open,' according to the affiliate station. Driver Frederick Stuart Ruth, 50, spoke with the police officer, and when pressed about possible drugs, presented him with 'a small baggie with several burnt marijuana blunts and gave them to the officer, saying that was all he had.' According to the media outlet, the officer spoke with a Noah's Ark worker, who claimed Whitaker entered the daycare bathroom, while Ruth left. '[A] gallon-size bag full of marijuana' was discovered by the officer inside the bathroom garbage can, KTRE said, with several marijuana bags tucked into it. Not again! Whitaker was reportedly found Tuesday driving with marijuana inside her car, with Vlenice Van Arline (right) as a passenger. Van Arline faces a possession of drug paraphernalia charge . The officer uncovered prescription drugs and marijuana inside both Whitaker's pocketbook and the Buick's glove compartment box, the affiliate station reported. Whitaker and Ruth face both possession of marijuana in a drug-free zone and possession of a dangerous drug charges, the media outlet reported. On Tuesday night, Whitaker was allegedly driving a Buick 'with a defective license plate light' with 50-year-old Vlenice Van Arline riding with her, KTRE said. Police stopped the car, and with the driver's side window down, 'the officer reported smelling a strong odor of marijuana coming from inside the car.' Another 'gallon-sized ziplock baggie with a large amount of marijuana in it' was found inside the car, plus two burned blunts, as well as another marijuana pouch and some burned marijuana, KTRE reported. From the Tuesday incident, the station said that Whitaker faces a charge of state-jail felony possession of marijuana in a drug-free zone, and Van Arline faces a possession of drug paraphernalia charge.

"QPR midfielder Joey Barton believes this current Rangers side is 'poles apart' from the one that finished bottom of the Barclays Premier League two years ago. Barton spent the campaign on loan at Marseille as Rangers finished 15 points adrift of safety in 2013 and paid the price for a lack of cohesion on and off the field. Harry Redknapp was unable to rescue the west Londoners after taking over in November that season but his side have made a positive start to their return to the top flight. Joey Barton (centre) celebrates with Charlie Austin after the QPR striker's goal against Burnley . A 2-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday - their third win in four games at home - saw Rangers climb out of the bottom three for the first time since September. 'The performances we have put in at Loftus Road have been exceptional, even in defeat sometimes,' Barton said. 'The team spirit and togetherness of the football club is poles apart from that side which went out of the league with a whimper. 'We came up and we want to give a good account of ourselves. Slowly but surely we are doing that."" Barton continued: 'To look at the table and see yourselves not in the bottom three is always heart-warming. Barton (centre) gets physical with PSG's David Beckham (right) during his loan spell at Marseille in 2013 . 'Hopefully at the end of May that's the case because that will be job done and goal achieved. There's a long way to go. This is the 15th game. 'After the defeat at Swansea the other day I asked our analyst to pull the table up from the year that QPR went down, the year I was in France. 'After 14 games we only had five points and I think it took them 16 games to win a game. So comparatively we're light years ahead.' Rangers' impressive form at home is in stark contrast to their results on the road where they have lost to Tottenham, Manchester United, Southampton, West Ham, Chelsea, Newcastle and Swansea this season. Redknapp's side are the only team in England's top four divisions yet to register a single point away from home and Barton admits it's a problem that needs addressing. Harry Redknapp (left) took up the to job at QPR in 2013, but he could not save the club from relegation . 'We have lost seven out of seven on the road but without making excuses, we haven't been to the easiest places,' Barton said. 'We haven't played teams in and around us. That will be the test for us. We've been to some of the tougher places in the league. 'I think everyone we've played away has been in the top 10 at the time we've played them. 'We're very mindful that we've got to improve our away form."" Rangers' awaydays do not get any easier as they travel to Everton and Arsenal before the end of the year either side of home games against West Brom and Crystal Palace. The bottom half of the table remains congested ahead of the busy Christmas calendar with only five points separating QPR in 17th and Aston Villa in 11th. 'If you string back-to-back wins together in this league you can propel yourself up the table,' Barton said. 'That's how tight it is. That's why people tune in. The Premier League is so competitive. Redknapp, however, managed to guide Barton (above) and his QPR side back to the Premier League last term . 'Chelsea's ""Invincibles"" all of a sudden go to Newcastle, Newcastle with their eighth-choice goalkeeper or whatever - and all of a sudden he comes on and they go on and beat Chelsea. 'There's not many other leagues where that happens. I've just seen on the TV, Real Madrid (have recorded an) 18th straight win. 'Arsenal went unbeaten for a year but I can't see anyone banging 18 wins out on the spin, not in this league, not with how competitive it is. 'There's a different element here, which is why people tune in from all over the globe.' Second-half goals from Leroy Fer and Charlie Austin ensured Rangers took maximum points against Burnley but there was disappointment too as Austin was sent off and will subsequently miss next Monday's match at Everton. 'He's our top scorer, he's been the difference for us at various times this season,' Barton added. 'To be without him is going to be a massive loss.'","Joey Barton spent QPR's 2013 campaign on loan at Marseille .

"Police in Arkansas announced this morning the arrest of a man named a person of interest in the disappearance of a real estate agent who vanished showing a property to an unknown would-be buyer. Arron Lewis, 33, was apprehended in Little Rock by the local police at around 10am Monday in connection to the case of Beverly Carter, 49, who went missing from an empty home in Scott, Arkansas, Thursday - moments after neighbors spotted a stranger pull into the driveway in a pick-up truck. The Little Rock blog Forbidden Hillcrest tweeted that Lewis was captured in Pleasant Pointe apartments on Green Mountain Drive after allegedly pulling a knife on a bystander. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught: Police have arrested Arron Lewis (left) in connection with the disappearance of realtor Beverly Carter (right). He was spotted in a vehicle crash this afternoon where he sustained facial injuries . First look: Eyewitness Adam Nash photographed Arron Lewis' arrest outside an apartment complex in Little Rock after he had allegedly pulled a knife on him . Cornered: Lewis jumped from a window and tried to flee, but was surrounded by officers (pictured) Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay held a press conference this afternoon telling reporters that the search for the missing real estate agent continues. 'I'm hopeful she's still alive,' the sheriff said. 'We told her family Friday night that we will do our best to get her back home safely, and that's what we're trying to do.' Holladay added that investigators are currently questioning Lewis in hopes of finding out Beverly Carter's whereabouts. Sheriff Holladay said the 33-year-old suspect is currently facing kidnapping charges, but he could face additional counts depending on Mrs Carter's condition. The sheriff also shed some light on the circumstances of Arron Lewis' capture this morning, telling reporters that officers in Little Rocks - some 15 miles away from Scott where he was last seen - got a call about a possible sighting of the wanted man at local a bus stop. A passerby recognized Lewis from the news coverage and approached him, sending the man fleeing towards the Pleasant Pointe  apartments. Nowhere to run: Lewis is pictured with his hands cuffed behind his back outside a Little Rock housing complex . As responding officers arrived outside the building, Lewis allegedly burst into the manager's office and jumped out the window in an attempt to flee, but was immediately caught. Lewis was named as a 'person of interest' after being involved in a car accident and taken to a hospital by police - before fleeing while officers thought he was having a CT scan done. Authorities have released images of Lewis, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, with blood on his face following the crash in a bid to track him down. According to the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office, deputies received a call at around 10am Sunday about a single-vehicle crash in the 8700 block of Cato Road in Jacksonville, in which Arron Lewis' vehicle smashed into a concrete culvert. A bloodied Mr Lewis reportedly told the responding officers that someone had run him off the road. A witness told investigators that Lewis was driving at a high speed when he lost control of his vehicle in a curve, KARK reported.. Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay told reporters Monday afternoon that Arron Lewis is being interviewed in the hopes of shedding light on the missing woman's whereabouts . Notorious: Lewis has criminal records in several states, including Arkansas, Missouri and Utah . Boyfriend: The 33-year-old 'person of interest' is seen here with a woman believed to be his girlfriend . The sheriff's office also has revealed that the 33-year-old is an active parolee with a long criminal history, including charges of felony theft; accomplice to theft; unlawful removal of theft device; obstruction of government operations, and other counts. Lewis also has rap sheets in Kansas City, Missouri, and in Utah. He was released on parole in Arkansas in August 2013. He now faces kidnapping charges, according to Arkansas Online. The development comes after Mrs Carter's husband of 35 years, Carl, made a tearful plea for authorities and residents to do all they can to find her. Mr Carter found his wife's car abandoned outside the house, which was left unlocked and open. 'I'm going to try to be strong as best I can - I just want my wife back,' he said. He appeared before cameras looking tired and distraught, as one neighbor revealed he saw a 'skinny white man' pull up at the house in a pick-up truck around the time of the disappearance. Search is over: Lewis (left and right), 33, of Jacksonville, had been on the run since Sunday after fleeing the hospital where he was taken following a crash . Dark past: Lewis has a long criminal history and is currently an active parolee . Mr Carter, who raised the alarm after his wife didn't come back from her appointment after three and a half hours, has since received unusual text messages from her phone, but no other sign of her. Describing the moments he went to look for her, he told KARK: 'By eight o'clock I knew something was wrong - but I waited to eight thirty. I went up in the house, went through every closet, everything.' He could find no sign of her inside, and police and volunteers have been searching ever since. It is unclear whether the pick-up driver was the buyer Mrs Carter was going to meet. Beverly Carter, 49, vanished from the property in Scott, near Little Rock, Arkansas, after meeting an unknown person at the address Thursday evening. She was reported missing by her husband, Carl, after she didn't make contact with her family after the 5.30pm appointment. Missing: Carl Carter spoke of his distress at the disappearance of his real estate agent wife on Thursday . Hunt: Mrs Carter, a realtor with Crye-Leike in Little Rock, Arkansas, has now been missing for three days . Matriarch: Beverly Carter has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren . Property: Mrs Carter was showing this property in Scott, Arkansas, to an unknown buyer who reportedly said he would be willing to pay in cash . When Carter went to the property to look for his wife, he found her car, a brown Cadillac, containing her purse, outside of the house, which had a wide open door. There was no trace of her inside. Police investigators say there was no evidence of a crime being committed. Mrs Carter is blonde, has green eyes, is 5' 2"" tall and weighs around 145lbs, according to search effort descriptions. Mrs Carter, who works for the Crye-Leike real estate company in Little Rock, was last seen wearing a black, sleeveless shirt and red capri pants. According to ABC News, the home had been foreclosed, and Mrs Carter was showing it to a buyer she had never met, who said he could pay in cash. Carter, who says it is extremely unusual for his wife of 34 years not to stay in close contact, said that he received unusual texts from her number at 1am the morning after she disappeared. Search: Mrs Carter's husband, Carl Carter (left), told how he went looking for his wife (right) and found an empty home and an abandoned car . He said: 'All of a sudden I received three texts in a row. One said ""Yes."" Then she sent another text that said, ""My phone's low. The battery's down, and I'll call you whenever I get signal."" 'And, then, straight back-to-back, I received a text that said ""Oh, I'm out drinking with some friends.""' 'Beverly's not a drinker…We just want our mom back, and my wife of 35 years…I need her.' He told First Coast News: 'Her car was there, and the house was wide open, and I knew that something was wrong.' Search: Police in Arkansas continued their search for Mrs Carter today . Left at the house: Mrs Carter's husband arrived at the home to find her new Cadillac - with custom plates - left outside, while the door of the house was open . The Pulaski County Sheriff's Office started its second day of searching this morning, and is urging landowners in the area to search their property in case she is there. Colleagues described Mrs Carter, a mother of two and grandmother of four, as 'fun-loving' and 'the sunshine in the office', adding they will strengthen protections for estate agents heading out alone in future. 'I feel like I’m in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can’t awaken,' Mrs Carter’s son, also named Carl, wrote on Facebook. 'She needs us, and we must continue to pray (and) brainstorm ways to find her.'

"It is a sign of how far Glasgow Warriors have come that leaving Toulouse with an eight-point defeat is disappointing. But I can’t help feeling this was a missed opportunity for them to get, at least, a losing bonus point. There were a few things outwith their own control but, ultimately, it came down to their own ill discipline which cost them a chance of winning. It is tough enough playing at Toulouse with a full complement of players on the pitch but to play them for a full 20 minutes when down to 14 men is near impossible. Toulouse full back Maxime Medard crashes over for a crucial try at Stade Ernest Wallon . There are good penalties and there are bad penalties in rugby. The good ones are when you are under severe pressure on your own line and giving away three points is much better than the seven that would occur if you let them recycle possession. Both the penalties that resulted in yellow cards were nothing like this. The first was a stupid tip tackle from Finn Russell when he took his opposite number above the horizontal and drove him into the ground. The fact that it was his back that he landed on and not his neck meant it was a yellow rather than a red card but Glasgow conceded 13 points during the period of being down a man. The other sin-binning was even dumber as Leone Nakarawa knocked the ball out of the scrum-half’s hand when he was lying on the ground and the Warriors defence was looking very strong. They only conceded three points during this period but it took a lot of energy for that to happen, which meant they had too much to do at the end of the match. Toulouse scrum half Sebastien Bezy kicked 14 points from the tee as the French side triumphed over Glasgow . Discipline is key and even more important when you go down to 14 men but Glasgow coughed up easy ball on two occasions to give Toulouse possession, one which resulted in the only try of the game for the French just at the start of the second half. Glasgow showed real guts to emerge with a try of their own at the end from sub Niko Matawalu. I am sure I was not alone in screaming at the TV for him to sprint as fast as he could to make the kick as easy as possible. But he jogged over the line, which meant that Duncan Weir had a tougher kick to earn the Warriors a losing bonus point — and he subsequently missed. It was a moment that could come back to haunt the Scots as all points in this group are going to be vital. Glasgow flanker Rob Harley (left) tries to halt the progress of Toulouse centre Yann David . There was a contentious decision at the end of the first half that ultimately cost Glasgow, as well. Referee John Lacey allowed Toulouse to take a quick line-out when Josh Strauss was lying close by on the ground with a head injury. This play ended up with the French converting a penalty, which was the main cause at the end of Glasgow missing out on a losing bonus point. There were many good performances from the likes of Alex Dunbar, Jonny Gray and Rob Harley but Glasgow were not able to convert pressure into points in the first 20 minutes when they dominated possession and territory. All is not lost because the return match comes only in six days’ time and Glasgow have another chance to turn the tables on Toulouse. Toulouse lock Yoann Maestri (right) is rocked by strong tackle but managers to get an offload away . What is key is to win the game without Toulouse gaining the bonus point that eluded Glasgow yesterday. Qualification to the quarter-finals is still in their own hands but only if they win at Scotstoun next Saturday. There is nothing to fear from Toulouse. They showed glimpses of potential yesterday but Glasgow can cope with them. Keeping all of their players on the pitch for the full 80 minutes is a must, though.","Glasgow lost 19-11 to Toulouse at Stade Ernest Wallon on Saturday .

"The Australia team will be battling their emotions and ‘inner demons’ when they play the first Test since the death of Phillip Hughes. The Aussies take on India tomorrow in a rescheduled first Test at Hughes’s adopted home ground, the Adelaide Oval, in what is sure to be an emotional atmosphere. Players will wear Hughes’s Baggy Green No 408 on their shirts, as well as black armbands. Australia will take on India in the first of a four-Test series beginning on Tuesday in Adelaide . The Australians will wear a shirt with the number 408, Phillip Hughes' Test number, as well as black armbands . The Adelaide Oval will host the first Test of the Australian summer and first since Phillip Hughes died . Shane Watson (left) faces a short ball in the nets in Adelaide, while David Warner (right) also practices . They will line up on the outfield before the first day’s play, in front of a giant 408 painted on the grass, to watch a video tribute to their former team-mate, which will be followed by 63 seconds of applause — the score on which Hughes was unbeaten when he was fatally injured by a bouncer during a domestic Sheffield Shield match just under two weeks ago. All-rounder Shane Watson is one of four members of the Test squad who were on the outfield at the Sydney Cricket Ground at the time Hughes was struck while playing for South Australia. He is confident all squad members will be physically and emotionally ready to play but he spoke honestly and openly about the impact Hughes’s death has had on him since returning to training two days after the 25-year-old’s funeral. ‘Mentally, it’s been the most challenging couple of days I’ve had to go through in my career, after seeing what happened over the past week, trying to process everything that happened, especially being there at the SCG. ‘The first couple of sessions were tough, especially the first one. A few things flooded into my head as soon as I went out to bat… I thought I’d processed quite well over the previous week. ‘This has been as important a four days’ lead up to a Test match that I have ever been involved in because there are a lot of inner demons that we’ve had to find our way through.’ Australia's players have been training in Adelaide over the last few days after attending Hughes' funeral . Captain Michael Clarke looks set to play after struggling with back and hamstring injuries . Peter Siddle (left) and Ryan Harris (right) compete for the ball during a training drill . For Watson, one of those demons involves facing up to top quality, aggressive, fast bowling — something he has done without a second thought for 52 Tests and 178 ODIs since his international debut in 2002. Suddenly, having witnessed close up what happened to Hughes, he has been struggling to put thoughts of the risks to one side when it comes to his own batting. ‘It’s been a big challenge to try to put the memories that are very much in the front of my mind — very recent — to move them back a bit in my mind and trust what I do as a batsman. I know everyone’s going to be in the same boat. ‘Bowling is a hell of a lot easier than batting because you have to make sure you hold your nerve while guys are steaming in.’ Watson admitted to feeling apprehensive about facing bouncers in the nets over the past couple of days, but said it got easier the more he batted — hence why he stayed in the nets half an hour longer than anyone else yesterday. ‘There was initially (some apprehension), no doubt. But I’ve got more comfortable with just reacting to what I see and trusting my skill. He added: ‘You know that if at any stage you get a ball and you get unlucky and it hits you in the wrong spot it can cause some serious damage. Harris tries his luck at punting an Australian Rules football during practice at the Adelaide Oval . Mitchell Johnson (left) bowls in the nets as Warner (right) practices his catching . 'I knew I had to confront it from day one when I went in, and every day that I’ve gone in I’ve felt more comfortable.’ Captain Michael Clarke looks set to lead Australia after coming through a fitness test over the weekend. 'He batted with purpose in the nets yesterday, having been struggling with a recurrence of his hamstring injury. His inclusion will give added poignancy to the opening day of the Test match after being such a figure of support for the Hughes family and delivering the most heartfelt and tearful of tributes. Given the emotional burden Clarke has shouldered, he has been excused from the captain’s traditional eve-of-Test press conference. That job has gone to Mitchell Johnson, Australia’s chief aggressor with the ball, who roughed up the England batsmen during the last Ashes series. Clarke inspects the wicket at the Adelaide Oval a couple of days before the first Test against India . Warner draws a crowd as he bats in the nets at the Adelaide Oval . There has been an international debate over the use of the bouncer in the wake of Hughes’s death but Watson is in no doubt that the Aussies will go hard at India. ‘We’ve played our best cricket when we are aggressive. Aggressive with bat and ball but especially with the ball, as we were during the last Ashes series. That’s not going to change because that’s when we are at our absolute best.’ Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said he hoped the Test will be an opportunity for supporters to pay tribute to Hughes. India will be the opposition for Australia in a four-Test series that will begin on Tuesday . MS Dhoni could play in the first Test having flown to Adelaide after recovering from a fractured thumb . India batsman Shikhar Dhawan looks on after breaking his bat during a net session . ‘Soon after arriving in Adelaide Phillip became a crowd favourite,’ he said. ‘This is an opportunity for those who embraced him so fondly to say their goodbye.’ When the 63 seconds of applause bursts out at the Adelaide Oval it will be hard to avoid the thought that his score that day at the SCG would surely have seen him recalled to the Test squad for the start of this series. Perhaps, instead, this Test will signify the start of a healing process for those players who were closest to Hughes. As silent mourning is replaced by ringing applause, a group of men will begin the hardest game of cricket they are likely to play in their lives.","Australia's first Test against India begins in Adelaide on Tuesday .

"Celtic face competition in their efforts to land Stuart Armstrong after Sporting Lisbon emerged as rival bidders for the Dundee United midfielder. As Sportsmail exclusively revealed last week, Scotland’s reigning champions are poised to reignite their interest in the 22-year-old when the January transfer window opens. Celtic assistant manager John Collins went on a specific scouting mission to watch Armstrong in action for Dundee United against Motherwell in the Scottish Cup. Celtic face competition in their efforts to land Stuart Armstrong after Sporting Lisbon emerged as rival bidders . The player’s strong running and eye for goal — he showed great composure to find the net at the end of a brilliant counter-attack in Friday night’s league win away to Ross County — have made him an obvious target for Ronny Deila. But reports in Portugal now suggest that Sporting are keen to land yet another promising Tannadice youngster, having swooped to sign Ryan Gauld on a six-year deal in the summer — and immediately slapping a £48million buy-out clause on the attacker. It is understood that, while the Lisbon side always intended to ease Gauld into the club by fielding him mainly for their B side, Scotland Under-21 star Armstrong is viewed as a player capable of making an immediate impact.

"Liverpool defender Kolo Toure believes their forthcoming must-win Champions League encounter against Basle is made for Steven Gerrard to create 'magic' again. The Reds captain will return to the starting line-up on Tuesday having been rested in Saturday's goalless draw at home to Sunderland. Brendan Rodgers' side have to beat the Swiss to progress to the knockout stage, and Toure reckons Gerrard is the man who can really make a difference. Steven Gerrard was rested for Saturday's draw with Sunderland, although he did come off the bench . Brendan Rodgers gives his captain instructions, and he will need him to put in a big performance on Tuesday . And, in light of Rodgers' judicious use of his 34-year-old captain this season, the Ivorian insists the midfielder's class is such that he does not need a full match to impact games. 'He is a man for great days. He makes the magic when no-one can make it. That is why he is one of the best players in the world,' he said. 'His age is nothing. People just keep talking, but if you have a player like that in your dressing room it is very important with his experience. Gerrard has received criticism for his performances this season, but Kolo Toure says he can still be great . Toure claims Gerrard is still one of the best in the world and can provide moments of magic . 'Players like that don't need 90 minutes to make the difference - only 20 or 30 minutes - and I am really happy to have him as a captain first and as a man because he is a great player.' Having been frustrated by Sunderland, Toure expects Basle to be more aggressive - even though they need only a draw to progress at Liverpool's expense. And he admits the Reds will have to be more adventurous than their recent performances - which have all been about regaining some defensive stability. 'The team has had to settle defensively first and, because we have been conceding some goals, it was important to get back to basics,' he added. The former England captain celebrates scoring against Leicester, when he benefited from being rested . Liverpool need to beat Basle, who they lost to earlier this season, to progress to the Champions League . 'It has been working well for us but not against Sunderland, but we will take risks against Basle because we have to put them under pressure and win the game. 'It is a must-win game - it is like a final. We will take some risks to win the game. 'I think tactically they will be better than Sunderland, and going forward they are going to be dangerous as they have quick and intelligent players.'","Liverpool take on Basle on Tuesday and must win to progress .

"The city of Montpellier was once again underwater today after violent storms lashed southern France for the second time in a week. Hundreds of residents were forced into emergency shelters by the overnight flash floods, which streamed down roads and highways after the River Lez burst its banks.

"Jack Nicklaus has set the scene for another Rory McIlroy spectacular at the US PGA Championship this week with the extraordinary prediction that he could win ‘15 or 20 majors’. The greatest golfer of all time shrugged off his usual conservative approach to lavish praise on the Northern Irishman to whom he has become something of a mentor. ‘I think Rory is an unbelievable talent,’ said the Golden Bear, who holds the all-time record with 18 majors. ‘It depends on what he feels his priorities are but I think he has the opportunity to win 15 or 20 majors if he wants to keep on playing.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch The Open Championship highlights . Shining light: Rory McIlroy already has three majors to his name at the tender age of 25 . In the swing: Jack Nicklaus praised McIlroy ahead of his bid to win his second USPGA at Valhalla . VIDEO The Open Championship - Final Round highlights . Nicklaus, who was speaking on ESPN radio, enthused: ‘I think Rory is an unbelievable talent. I love his swing, his rhythm, his spirit. He has got a little swagger there, it’s a little bit cocky but it is not offensive. I like that self-confidence in a young man. ‘He’s got an unbelievable amount of speed in his golf swing. He obviously hits it a long way but he does it consistently, with control.’ Nicklaus has been there for McIlroy ever since the latter played in Jack’s tournament in Florida in 2009. In May, the pair had a 90-minute working lunch where McIlroy asked for the great man’s guidance. It cannot be just a coincidence that since then McIlroy has been playing with Nicklaus-like focus and turning in some of the best golf of his life. At 22, McIlroy became the youngest winner of the US Open in 80 years when he started his major account in 2011 and broke Nicklaus’s record for the largest winning margin at the US PGA when he claimed that the following year by eight strokes. After winning The Open last month, he joined Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only men to win three majors by the age of 25. In relaxed mood: McIlroy wanders around Valhalla in the company of close friend Darren Clarke . Bunker down: McIlroy practises in the sand ahead of the final major of the year in Kentucky . Taken under his wing: Jack Nicklaus is a long-time supporter of McIlroy . Now he starts as firm favourite this week to add the season’s final major to The Open and the Bridgestone Invitational he won in his previous two outings. One foe he would not have expected to come across was Woods, who had to withdraw during the final round of the Bridgestone on Sunday with back trouble. To general astonishment and against all odds, Woods turned up at Valhalla  and went out for a practice round shortly after 2pm. Woods has won 14 majors but his last was in 2008 and his injury troubles over the last few years have shown that challenging Nicklaus’s record is so dependant on staying fit. One man who was delighted to see Woods was US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson. ‘I’ve talked to him and texted him and I think the fact he is here tells me that he wants to make our team,’ said Watson, who also announced that Steve Stricker, who just happens to be Tiger’s best pal on tour, will be one of his vice-captains. Stricker said it was vital for America’s chances at Gleneagles next month that Woods was able to get healthy. ‘I know how deeply he wants to be a part of this team and I think that’s why he is here at Valhalla,’ said Stricker. ‘He was on that last team at Medinah that didn’t get it done and he wants to help us make amends. ‘We will see how he gets on this week but hopefully he will come through it feeling healthy and he gets his game going in the right direction. We need him.’ Watson said he would leave it to Woods to decide whether he was fit enough for Gleneagles. ‘If he tells me he is healthy and he’s playing well, he will be on the team,’ he said.","With three majors to his name at 25, Nicklaus says McIlroy can usurp his tally of 18 titles .

"Nolberto Solano is desperate to prove himself as a manager in English or Scottish football, and has highlighted vacancies at Motherwell and Hartlepool United among potential starting points. The former Newcastle United midfielder previously coached in Toronto, Canada, and was manager of Universitario de Deportes in his native Peru, but has been looking for a job in the UK since returning less than three months ago. The 39-year-old claims he has already had an interview with Scottish Premiership club Motherwell, though that depends whether a proposed takeover by an Argentina-based consortium goes ahead. Former Newcastle star Nolberto Solano is looking to break into football management in England or Scotland . The ex-Newcastle midfielder previously coached in Toronto and was manager of Universitario de Deportes . The 39-year-old claims he has already had an interview with Scottish Premiership club Motherwell . Well Society are believed to have made the former Peru international their first choice after he discussed his 'philosophy' with the potential new owners following Motherwell's 1-0 win over Dundee United at Fir Park on November 7. But Solano has told Sportsmail he remains open to all vacancies, including the empty slot at Hartlepool, where the midfielder ended his 19-year playing career in 2012. 'I've been coaching in Peru, coaching in Canada, so now I'm just trying to come back into the UK, looking for a chance, looking for an opportunity,’ he said. 'That's my plan. It's not easy. Scotland, Premier League, League One, League Two, it's still really tough for managers because it's not an easy job, but it's a challenge. My passion is football, always football.

'Maybe I get a call again tomorrow, then another day to manage or coach in Peru, or anywhere in Europe or somewhere like that. 'My main place is here. It would be nice if anything came from Scotland or England. 'I want to prove myself. I want to show what I can do as a manager. 'Hartlepool would be a why not? It is an opportunity. It is a really difficult time for the club, but it's a challenge. Life is a challenge all the time so it would be nice to get at least the opportunity.’ Paul Murray was sacked by the club sitting bottom of League Two on Saturday, less than 24 hours after they were beaten by non-League Blyth Spartans in the FA Cup second round at Victoria Park. Solano, the first Peruvian to play in the Barclays Premier League, says he met Motherwell's potential new owners but that he understands 'four or five more managers' have been interviewed. Hartlepool may prove a better fit for Solano, given its location in the North East where the Newcastle legend and his family currently live. Solano became the first Peruvian to play in the Premier League and has plenty of experience on the pitch . Like the Monkey Hangers,  Universitario were in the relegation zone when Solano took over but Solano lifted the Peruvian Primera Division club to safety. 'I'm looking anywhere,' Solano admits. 'I'm prepared to take that challenge, that opportunity. But we'll see. Maybe there are too many managers around. 'I'm simple. My philosophy in football is I would always like to play football. Even if you play in League One, League Two, you need to play. You need to be at that level. You need to bring more quality. That's my philosophy.'

"The Ebola High Level Protection Suit - yours, on Amazon, for just $1,300. The Internet was awash with products offering protection from the deadly virus which has so far claimed one life in the U.S. An infectious disease doctor today rubbished the panic-buying of 'Ebola protection kits' as a waste of money, saying the only use the general public will have for a hazmat suit is as a Halloween costume. Protective suits, face masks and survival kits have been flying off the shelves amid increasing panic over Ebola in the U.S. after one sufferer died on Wednesday and two remained hospitalized. A total of 48 are being monitored for contagious symptoms. Online commerce sites are awash with isolation gowns, surgical masks, booties and duct tape claiming to offer full protection from the deadly virus. There has also been a huge buy-up in preparation kits and supplies. Kits often contain a mix of surgical masks, gloves, bio-hazard bags and sanitizer wipes. And the price of protection isn't cheap - while a basic Ebola protective kit costs around $50 per person, one high-level protection suit is selling on Amazon for $1,300. The bright blue suit, which appears more suited to a space mission than a trip to the mall, is described as a 'Level A Suite'. It has a back-entry PVC face shield, attached gloves and three-layers of fabric with 'proprietary barrier films, spunbond nonwoven substrate and inner barrier films'. However University of Pittsburgh infectious disease expert, Dr Amesh Adalja, told MailOnline today the suits only use would be as a Halloween costume. Dr Adalja, who sits on the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said: '[The suits] are a waste of money. 'Ebola does not pose a risk to the general public because it is not contagious unless you come in contact with the bodily fluids of a symptomatic individual.' He said that people on the street have little to fear because the virus doesn't spread like the common cold. He advised Americans to be more concerned with getting their flu vaccines - an infection which kills thousands of people each year. Dr Adalja added: 'Buying hazmat suits is for a very far-fetched scenario but it's not going to stop people from buying them. 'A suit won't have much use other than as a Halloween costume.' Dr Alexis Thomas, who practises in London, also said that there was little use in protective suits for the general public. She said: 'Panic buying of personal protective clothing e.g. hazmat suits is unnecessary and inappropriate. 'Ebola is transmitted via direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. 'Unless you are going to be caring directly for someone who has Ebola symptoms and has a high risk of having the disease due to recent travel from an endemic region, buying or wearing a hazmat suit is unnecessary and just helps to further fuel ill-informed hysteria.' Scroll down for video . Med-Tech Resource's Ebola kit, which sells for $24.99, is described on their website as the 'ultimate protection and prevention kit for Ebola, influenza, and other outbreaks' Mountainside Medical Equipment was promoting an Ebola Virus Protection Kit - which came with ten dollars off at $19.95 and included gloves, disinfectant and a biohazard waste bag . A number of sites were quick to target the Ebola market. Mountainside Medical Equipment was promoting an 'Ebola Virus Protection Kit' - which came discounted at $19.95. A representative for the company told MailOnline today that the kit was for 'personal protection' but the company couldn't '100 per cent guarantee protection against Ebola'. Another site, Med-Tech Resource, sells their Ebola Kit for $25, with the words: 'The ultimate protection and prevention kit for Ebola, influenza, and other outbreaks. 'Approved by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), our kit includes everything you need to help prevent the spread of Ebola.' A representative from the company refused to comment to MailOnline today when asked about the number of kits which had been sold online. 'Expert' survival guides on how to survive Ebola are being self-published and sold on Amazon - close to 40 have been published in the last month alone . Then there's the literature where the majority of titles appear to be written by self-professed experts. For about $50, this Ebola kit can be bought online and claims to protect against the virus . One title, 'Ebola: Natural Remedies + Government Conspiracies', poses the question: 'The Ebola virus is here on U.S. soil, why was it welcomed here by the CDC? ... What are they trying to hide?' Another publication, 'Ebola Survival Guide 2015: 10 Things you Must Know to Survive the Coming Ebola Outbreak!' comes with a warning label on the cover: 'Ebola could infect 4.1 billion people over the next 24 months!' In the last 30 days alone, around 40 new Ebola titles have been self-published to be bought as e-books on Amazon. Dr Adalja refused to comment on specific publications which he had not reviewed but advised those with concerns about Ebola to look at the WHO and CDC websites, which has a wealth of scientifically-verified information on the virus. The CDC reported on Wednesday that it is being flooded with more than 800 calls per day from local health workers and patients who are desperate to know if symptoms including headaches, fever and nausea are Ebola. Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, became America's 'patient zero' on Wednesday after he was the first person to die from Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The Liberian national had arrived in the country on September 20 and was finally hospitalized on September 28 with infection symptoms, after being initially sent home from the hospital with antibiotics. Some 48 people, who were in contact with Mr Duncan, are now being monitored, with ten being considered high-risk. On Wednesday, a Dallas sheriff's deputy, who was not among the 48 being monitored, attended an urgent-care clinic in Frisco, Texas, with Ebola-like symptoms. Ebola test results are pending for Sgt Michael Monnig. Five U.S. citizens have been diagnosed with Ebola and three of them have beaten the virus. Doctors Kent Brantly and Rick Sacra, along with missionary aid worker, Nancy Writebol, were all flown back from Liberia to be treated in U.S. hospitals this summer. They have since received the all-clear. NBC News cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, the latest American victim, was quarantined at Nebraska Medical Center on Monday after being flown in from Liberia. A fourth victim, a World Health Organization doctor, is being treated in Atlanta. Close to 3,500 people have died from Ebola in West Africa following the outbreak in December 2013 in Guinea. The concern over Ebola echoed the reaction more than a decade ago to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The disease infected about 8,000 people in 2003, killing nearly 800.","Online commerce sites are awash with hazmat suits, surgical masks, booties and biohazard bags claiming to offer full protection against Ebola .

"Former Premier League stars Gary Neville and Stan Collymore were involved in a Twitter spat following Diego Costa's controversial booking for a dive during Chelsea's 3-1 win at Burnley on Monday night. Former Manchester United defender Neville, now a pundit on Sky Sports, claimed every player had gone to ground to win a foul in the Premier League era. But ex-Liverpool striker Collymore, now a radio presenter and commentator, challenged Neville to find footage of him diving - promising to quit broadcasting if he managed it. Clipped: Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton appeared to have made contact with Costa . Contact: Replays showed he was brought down by the left hand of Heaton . Penalised: Costa was wrongfully booked as Michael Oliver thought he dived . Forthright: Stan Collymore's opinion on the Costa incident - Neville, who played with Ronaldo, disagreed . VIDEO Positive reaction a plus for Mourinho . Costa was cautioned by referee Michael Oliver for simulation after going down under the challenge of Burnley keeper Tom Heaton - TV replays showed he had been fouled and the visitors should have been awarded a penalty. However, Collymore insisted the Chelsea striker dived but added that 'most pundits' would say it was a spot-kick, as indeed Neville did. The former defender went on to say on Sky Sports that 'every player' would have gone to ground at some stage during their career. The debate escalated on Twitter after the match as Collymore insisted that he had never gone down to gain an advantage. Eventually, he challenged the Sky pundit to find footage of him diving, saying he would walk away from radio and TV if he did. Neville returned with a counter challenge, if he found the former England striker had dived during his career he then must wear a Manchester United top in Liverpool. Neville tweeted: 'As I said every player. Give me a few days or so. Need a sky anorak in the archives? Anyone?'

"You could almost see the collective wince in the away end at Loftus Road. The calf injury sustained by Vincent Kompany in midweek presented a problem much bigger than Manchester City merely missing their leader - it brought Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala together. A scary prospect indeed. These are two central defenders with genuine ability, but for whatever reason continue to turn in disastrous performances and undermine the Premier League champions’ credibility. Yoon Suk-Young of QPR is challenged by Martin Demichelis (right) during the match at Loftus Road . Striker Bobby Zamora of Queens Park Rangers battles with Mangala (right) for the ball . They had never played a league fixture alongside each other before Saturday evening - and it showed. This was as bad as it could possibly get - a shambles from start to finish. Two men who didn’t talk to each other, engulfed with the jitters. Memories of the difficulties endured against Newcastle in the Capital One Cup are still fresh. The really startling fact is that these chasings haven’t come against a team with the quality of a Chelsea - they find themselves in a mess when met with sides who will finish the season in the bottom half. Kompany himself - who watched on solemnly alongside Richard Wright - has been nowhere near his commanding best this season, but his absence shows just why Manuel Pellegrini won’t be lifting the title come May. Martin Demichelis' defensive statistics during the 2-2 draw at QPR via Match Zone . Manchester City defender Demichelis' own goal during the second half at Loftus Road via Match Zone . Eliaqium Mangala's defensive statistics during the 2-2 at QPR via Match Zone . They need to admit their mistakes in the transfer market and go out in January to sign a partner for Kompany - one who can slot in immediately and rid us of this ludicrous facade. The way in which Mangala was pulled apart by the combination of Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin makes the £32million paid to Porto in the summer a laughable amount. Mangala’s only bit of positive defending was a last-ditch tackle to clear as Austin raced through. Even then he had been caught the wrong side in the direct place. Writing 23-year-old Mangala off already - three months into his career in English football - would be wrong, but they cannot go on with him in this frame of mind. With each passing week he gets worse, he looks increasingly nervous and makes more mistakes. It took just eight minutes for the two to be guilty of ball-watching as the offside Austin headed beyond Joe Hart. City did have a high line which caught the striker out, but neither had tracked him. Neither had a clue where he was. And they did exactly the same moments later when Austin was free, 12 yards out, but thwarted brilliantly by the goalkeeper. That particular inquest went as far as a a shrug. Time and again a QPR man go in between them. Demichelis put past his own goalkeeper Joe Hart with a dismally-timed header in the second half . Demichelis stands defeated as the QPR players celebrate going 2-1 in front . City were shaken. There was no confidence emanating from Hart - who found himself in all sorts of trouble. Kompany is the man to rally in that situation, but Mangala and Demichelis shrank, with hands on hips, gormless expressions and puzzled eyes. The Argentine was absent without leave when Austin finally got his goal; it was difficult to miss the former Swindon Town frontman running between the centre-halves, but Demichelis stood and watched with a hand up. Not offside, and not clever. He looked lost, not a man who has starred in a World Cup final. It’s a worrying trait and does beg the question as to the whereabouts of Matija Nastasic, who hasn’t featured in the Premier League since January. The Serbian is 21 but showed he is infinitely more consistent than those ahead of him. Pellegrini clearly doesn’t fancy him, but may have to re-think that assessment sharpish. Or just hope Kompany is back fit and firing after the . international break. Because my word, do they need him. Demichelis ended up putting through his own net. Somehow, it felt oh so fitting.","Martin Demichelis and Eliaqium Mangala struggle in 2-2 draw at QPR .

"A haul of sketches and paintings by one of the world's most prolific art forgers - whose work was described as often more beautiful than the original - has been put up for sale. Eric Hebborn duped art dealers and galleries world-wide with his paintings in the style of Renaissance greats such Rubens, Van Dyck, Corot and Michelangelo. His work was so convincing that dealers sold them on as genuine originals, and much of his undetected work still hangs in galleries and museums around the world. After he was murdered in 1996 his sister retrieved all of the work left in his studio, including scores of 'doodles' or preparatory drawings in ink, crayon and watercolours which appear to show Hebborn practicing imitating the old masters' hand. A water sketch of seated deity, based on Michelangelo's Prophet Jeremiah, by master forger Eric Hebborn . Now, 236 drawings are being sold in individual lots, ranging in price from £100 to £500 each by Webbs of Wilton auctioneers in Wiltshire. In one sketch, the master forger has almost exactly copied Michelangelo's Prophet Jeremiah. Other drawings are in Renaissance style but not specific to a particular artist. Hebborn was never prosecuted by police for fraud. He was murdered after being beaten about the head with a blunt instrument by a mystery attacker in Italy in 1996. Auctioneer Simon Wingett said: 'Eric Hebborn was probably the world's best ever art forger - he was as good as it got when it came to drawing. 'He created his own pictures in the style of the old masters.' Hebborn, from London, maintained he never tried to convince people his works were originals but he also never signed them and was happy to let art dealers believe that they were by old masters. Lot 244, a water sketch of two figures based on Michelangelo.  Hebborn created around 1,000 drawings and paintings in the style of Renaissance greats such Rubens, Van Dyck, Corot and Castiglione . Lot 365, an ink and wash sketch of two figures wrestling an animal to the ground. His work was so convincing that dealers sold them on as genuine originals . Beneath one of the drawings in the style of landscape and portrait painter Jean-Baptiste Corot, he wrote: 'Only the experts are worth fooling, the greater the expert the greater the satisfaction of deceiving them.' Mr Wingett said: 'He never really set out to deceive but was led down that path by dealers who wanted to make whatever they could out of him. 'They were happy to believe they were originals as were the museums they sold them to. 'Some rather famous names in the art world were involved and some rather famous museums all over the world that have Hebborns in them without realising. 'Even if they had their suspicions they are never going to want to be proved wrong because of their reputation. Lot 369, a pencil sketch of Daniel in the Lion's Den. Hebborn's drawings are being sold in individual lots, ranging in price from £100 to £500 each by Webbs of Wilton auctioneers in Wiltshire . Lot 366, a pencil and wash sketch of two prostrate figures. Much of his undetected work still hangs in galleries and museums around the world. A watercolour of a coastal scene and wrecked wooden fishing boat, signed in pencil by Hebborn. He studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in the 1950s and turned to forgery after critics failed to appreciate his own work . 'His was the highest quality work. These drawings were part of his loose works or doodles of his. Some of them are preparatory drawings for bigger work, such as a finished oil paintings that may be hanging in a museum somewhere.' Hebborn studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in the 1950s and turned to forgery after critics failed to appreciate his own work. His deception was revealed in 1978 when a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, examined two drawings from an established dealer of old master work and noticed they had been executed on the same kind of paper . A pencil and charcoal drawing of two figures and an angel. Hebborn confessed to making forged work but insisted he had done nothing wrong and instead blamed the art dealers for allowing themselves to be deceived .

His deception was revealed in 1978 when a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, US, examined two drawings from an established dealer of old master work and noticed they had been executed on the same kind of paper. Hebborn confessed to making forged work in 1984 but insisted he had done nothing wrong and instead blamed the art dealers for allowing themselves to be deceived. Mr Wingett added: 'These drawings provide a fascinating insight into somebody who made a lot of money for people and deceived some of the finest art institutions in the world. 'While many people would quite like to forget Eric Hebborn there is a new generation of art enthusiasts who don't know who he was and would be interested in these drawings.'

"A father believes he is lucky to be alive after a severe reaction to ibuprofen caused his face to swell and hives to appear all over his body. Paul Burkhardt, 36, from Crewkerne, Somerset, bought a 70p packet of the drug after coming down with flu. Two days later he woke up to discover his face was unusually puffy and his body red and itchy. Paul Burkhardt, 36, suffered an allergic reaction to ibuprofen which caused his face to blow up . Mr Burkhardt woke up in the middle of the night with itchy, red hives all over his body . His GP prescribed steroids and anti-histamines to counteract the reaction. Mr Burkhardt insists he had not taken more than the recommended dose of ibuprofen . Mr Burkhardt, a mechanical engineer, rushed to his local GP surgery where he was prescribed steroids and antihistamines to counteract the reaction. The father-of-one believes just one more dose of the pills could have proved fatal. 'It was unbelievable,' he said. 'It's scary to think that a 70p packet of medication can do that to you. 'I was lucky to get to the doctor when I did. Anaphlyaxis could have set in which would have caused my oesophagus to swell up - I could have died. 'I think next time I will just try to battle the flu off without any extra help.' Hives are a well-documented side effect of ibuprofen and can also be caused by medication such as penicillin and aspirin. Mr Burkhardt came down with the flu more than two weeks ago and decided to start taking the medication in an attempt to alleviate the symptoms. He purchased the own-brand product from his local corner shop, and began taking two tablets every five to six hours, ensuring he did not exceed the recommended daily amount. But days after he began taking the medication he woke up in the night with irritated skin. When he woke in the night, Mr Burkhardt thought the itchy hives (left and right) must be from mosquitoes, before he realised there were none in the room . He believes one more dose could have been fatal - and is thankful he forgot to take the final dose of the day . 'I don't normally take tablets, I've had one or two on the odd occasion, but never a sustained dosage' he said. 'I read the instructions carefully and made sure I did not take too many of the pills. Hives, also known as urticaria, are an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps, patches, or welts on the skin that appear suddenly - either as a result of allergies, or for other reasons. They are a well-documented side effect of ibuprofen and can also be caused by medication such as penicillin and aspirin. Hives occur when mast cells (inflammatory cells of the skin) are triggered to release a chemical called histamine. Histamine affects the blood flow in the skin, causing the red itchy bumps. Anti-histamines are taken to block the effect of histamine in the body. 'I woke up in the night and I thought I had been bitten by a mosquito because my waist was so itchy. 'Then I noticed it started spreading all up my body and I thought 'something's not right here, there aren't any mosquitoes in the room'. 'I could feel my face getting bigger and itching so I decided to drive myself to the doctors before my eyes closed over and it was too late.' The effects of the allergic reaction, a rare side effect, lasted around a week. It wasn't until Wednesday that Mr Burkhardt was able to stop taking the medication to counteract the reaction. He said: 'I told the doctor that the only thing I had done different was take the medication, I've never had a reaction to anything before. 'He said that it was probably the ibuprofen that caused it. 'I forgot to take the final two tablets of the day before I went to bed. Looking back that could have been the straw on the camel's back.'","Paul Burkhardt, 36, bought a 70p pack of ibuprofen from a corner shop .

"Ben Pierce was born so prematurely doctors didn't think he would survive. With a fighting spirit he pulled through, but his eyes struggled to fully develop. A surgery restored his sight, but it left scar tissue, which will continue to grow as he does. Now nine, the Dallas boy will eventually lose his sight completely, doctors believe, but they don't know when, according to The Daily News-Miner. Determined to make the most of the time he has left, Ben, encouraged by his parents, Kit and Heidi, started drafting a Bucket List of the things he wanted to see, before he can no longer see. On top of one of the Seven Wonders of the World: Ben Pierce, 9, who is slowly losing his sight, was granted a wish to see the Northern Lights in Alaska by Alaska Airlines . Dream come true: Ben Pierce (right) with his sibling and his mom Heidi looking over the aurora . Breathtaking: Even though Ben's sight is fading, he was still able to grasp the marvel of the Northern Lights during the trip this week . Amazing: The mysterious curtain of colors caused by gas particles increasing their speed and density while stirring within the Earth's magnetic field . All smiles: Ben, who was born premature, pictured here with one of his siblings and his father, Kit . The Eiffel Tower, the Egypitan Pyramids, the Apple store in Dallas and a sunny Los Angeles beach were some. However coming from a family of six, not all would be possible. The one that stood out on the list where the Northern Lights in Alaska, the mysterious curtain of colors caused by gas particles increasing their speed and density while stirring within the Earth's magnetic field. Amazingly, visiting this seventh wonder of the world became possible thanks to the kindness of a complete stranger. Chris Cice, who works for Alaska Airlines as a pilot, was told about Ben's condition and his list by daughter, who had heard about it at school. Cice passed the story on to some bosses at the airline, who decided they wanted to help also. Premature: Ben was born so early that doctors didn't believe he would make it. He pushed through, however his sight has been slowly worsening as he has gotten older . Alaska Airlines then gave Ben, his parents and five siblings free return tickets to Fairbanks, Alaska, to see the Northern Lights, The News-Miner reported. And so on Thursday, the Pierce family touched down and checked into the Chena Hot Springs Resort. At midnight they were woken up by a guide and taken up a trail to the Northern Lights vantage point. Despite his fading vision, which sometimes him to use a magnifying glass to read, Ben was able to make out the show that was happening above him. 'It's really beautiful and pretty,' Ben told KTUU, gazing up at the lights. Happy: Among the other things on Ben's 'bucket list' are the Eiffel Tower, which his family hopes to visit sometime next, as well as the Pyramids in Egypt and the beaches of Los Angeles . 'It's like water colors going across the sky.' The Pierce family already have another trip book. They will soon go to Turner Falls, Oklahoma, to see Native American dancing, and plan to visit London and Paris next year, KTUU reported. Ben's journey to the Northern Lights was documented by photographer Ronn Murray.","Dallas boy Ben Pierce was born premature .

"Toronto voters replaced their notorious mayor, Rob Ford, on Monday and rejected  his brother's bid to take the city's top job, electing instead a moderate conservative broadcaster who promised to unite a city divided by four years of scandal and vitriol. John Tory, a former chief executive of major cable company Rogers Communications, had 40 per cent of the vote, compared to 34 per cent for Doug Ford, brother of outgoing Mayor Rob Ford. Rob Ford will not disappear completely from the political scene, however, after winning election as a city councilor. Scroll down for video .

Well done dad: Rob Ford  gets a high five from son Doug after it is announced he was elected as a Toronto city councillor . Left-leaning Olivia Chow was third in the mayoral race, with nearly 23 per cent of the vote. The results were announced with more than 90 percent of polling stations reporting. Rob Ford's four-year tenure as mayor of Canada's largest city was marred by scandals over his illegal drug use and public drunkenness. He announced last month that he wouldn't seek re-election as mayor, as he battles a rare form of cancer. His brother Doug, a city councilor, ran in his place. Doug Ford's supporters booed when he congratulated Tory on his victory. Doug Ford later said the scandals played a part in the loss but said he was ‘super proud’ of his brother. ‘I still believe he's the best mayor ever,’ Doug Ford said. Toronto mayoral candidates Olivia Chow, left, Doug Ford, center, and eventual winner John Tory, right, pose with school children after a municipal debate for the city election in Toronto . Hugs for dad: Outgoing Mayor Rob Ford gets hugs from his children Doug and Stephanie after being elected as a city councillor . Rob Ford announced last month that he wouldn't seek re-election as mayor as he battles a rare form of cancer in his abdomen . Despite the cancer, Rob Ford opted to seek the City Council seat held by his brother from the Etobicoke district in western Toronto, where he launched his political career. He won his old seat in a landslide on Monday and strongly hinted he may seek to run for mayor again in four years. ‘In four more years, you're going to see another example of the Ford family never, ever, ever giving up,’ he said. Rob Ford dropped out of the election after doctors revealed he has malignant liposarcoma, an aggressive type of cancerous tumor, in his abdomen. He is undergoing treatment in Toronto. After months of denials, Rob Ford in 2013 acknowledged he had smoked crack cocaine in one of his ‘drunken stupors,’ but he refused to resign. The City Council stripped Ford of most of his powers but lacked the authority to force him out of office because he wasn't convicted of a crime. Rob Ford announced he was entering rehab for drugs and alcohol in April 2014 after newspaper reports detailed three nights in which he was extremely intoxicated. John Tory (pictured back right with his family) was elected mayor thanks to a groundswell of 'anyone but Ford' sentiment. He was endorsed by every major newspaper in Toronto, home to about 6 million people . Rob Ford, right, consoles his brother mayoral candidate Doug Ford, left, at his mother's home in Toronto on Monday . One report was about a video that appeared to show him smoking a crack pipe nearly a year after reports of a similar video first brought him international attention. Rob Ford's antics made him the target of late-night television comedians in the U.S. Last March, he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after months of wooing by the talk-show host, who introduced his guest by saying he ‘has tripped, bumped, danced, argued and smoked his way into our national consciousness.’ When Ford was elected mayor in 2010, his drug and alcohol use weren't known - but his bluster was. A plurality of voters backed him, eager to shake things up at a City Hall they viewed as elitist and wasteful. Ford's voter base resided mainly in outer suburbs like Etobicoke. He appealed to those residents with his populist, common man touch and with promises to slash spending, cut taxes and end what he called ‘the war on the car.’ Never quit: Rob Ford speaks to supporters after winning his seat on city council at mayoral candidate Doug Ford's election night headquarters in Toronto on Monday . He first won as mayor by promising to ‘stop the gravy train’ of government spending. But Toronto got more turmoil than expected. Tory, 60, a longtime moderate conservative politician and adviser, has also served as commissioner of the Canadian Football League and more recently hosted a radio talk show. He ran for mayor in 2003 and lost. Tory, riding on a groundswell of 'anyone but Ford' sentiment, was endorsed by every major newspaper in Toronto, home to about 6 million people. Tory has promised to end the circus at City Hall and to get people moving with a new public transit plan, identified by most voters as a top priority in the campaign.","Toronto voters replaced their notorious mayor, Rob Ford, on Monday and rejected an attempt by his brother to take the city's top job .

"Eric Dier became an instant Tottenham hero when he scored their winning goal deep into stoppage time at West Ham on Saturday. The new boy settled the spicy opening day derby when he sprinted forward from right-back to collect a pass from Harry Kane, round goalkeeper Adrian and roll the ball into the unguarded net. But who is the man who stole the headlines in such dramatic circumstances at Upton Park? VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Eric Dier in action during his Sporting Lisbon days . Debut goal: Eric Dier slots home the winning goal on his Spurs debut . Let's celebrate: Dier (15) is mobbed by Spurs team-mates including Harry Kane (18) What a start: Dier is the opening day hero as he celebrates with Danny Rose (left) and Christian Eriksen (right) Name: Eric Dier . Age: 20 . Position: Centre-back . Where does he come from? Eric Jeremy Edgar Dier, to give him his full name, was born in Cheltenham but his parents moved to Portugal aged 10 when his mother, who works in the mass catering industry, was offered a job at the 2004 European Championships. Soon after arriving from England, Dier's footballing ability was noted by his PE teacher Miguel Silva and he was referred to scouts at Sporting Lisbon. In an interview with Sportsmail last year, Dier explained: 'My PE teacher used to scout for Sporting and, when I was nine, he recommended me for a trial. 'From there, I just went up through the age groups and was always kept on while others were dropping out. What a moment: Dier is congratulated by Kane as they head for the Spurs following with the ball in the net . 'I suppose it was only when they offered me a contract at 14 and I enrolled in the academy school that I realised it might be quite serious.' Dier soon found the Sporting academy a home-away-from-home and when his parents returned to the UK in 2010, he stayed out in Portugal. In a BBC interview that year, a 16-year-old Dier said: 'I love the training, the Portuguese people, the Portuguese culture. Everything about this place I like.' He duly signed professional form with Sporting in April 2010, with the Portuguese club seeing off interest from Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United, the team Dier supported as a boy. Dominant: Spurs might not have been at their best at Upton Park but Dier made his presence felt . What happened next? In January 2011, Dier joined Everton on a loan that was initially meant to last until the end of June. Sporting said at the time the loan was 'an opportunity for the athlete to grow in a more competitive and demanding environment.' In the end, this short-term loan lasted some 18 months as he became a regular in Everton's youth and reserve sides. The move came at just the right time, as Dier later admitted: 'I had become a bit spoiled or complacent at Sporting and I needed a kick up the backside, which is what Everton gave me. 'It was quite tough going to an unfamiliar place where I didn't know anyone at first. 'Coaches like Alan Stubbs were quite hard on me but that helped a lot. It was the best thing that could have happened. It really hardened me up physically and mentally. The football was much faster, physical and more direct than here.' Portugeezer: Dier keeps the ball from Nemanja Matic - now of Chelsea - while on Sporting Lisbon duty . Return to Portugal . Sporting - the academy that produced the likes of Luis Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani - were never going to let a talent like Dier stay away for too long and, with designs on fast-tracking him to their first team, he returned to Portugal in August 2012. Dier was placed in the B team squad for that campaign, playing in the second-tier Segunda Liga. His debut came as a substitute for Diego Rubio in a 3-1 win at Atletico on August 26 and his first goal came against rivals Benfica a couple of months later. It was certainly a moment he'll never forget, as he explained to Sportsmail: 'I was determined to take my chance when it came along. The Benfica match was an amazing experience - flares were going off everywhere and you can tell the fans don't like each other. 'It went by in a blur. One thing I've found in the first team is the intensity of concentration required is much greater and that was very tiring at first, but I'm getting used to it.' Sorting things out: Dier established himself as a central midfielder when he first broke through in Lisbon . Promotion to the first team . A week later and Dier was handed his first team debut in a home win over Braga and a further fortnight after that, he scored his first and only senior goal for the club against Moreirense. He went on to establish himself in the side, regularly playing as a central midfielder, before a fractured rib curtailed his first season in the first team. Dier was in and out of the team the following season, usually slotting in at centre-back or in a defensive midfield role. In all, he played 32 senior games for Sporting, scoring once. Happy: Dier spoke of his delight at moving to Spurs after signing his five-year deal on August 2 this year . London calling . Dier signed a five-year contract with Tottenham on August 2 this year, with a £4m fee agreed. Upon moving to north London, Dier said: 'I'm really excited to be joining such a big club. 'I'm really happy to be here. I want to impress the manager and keep the fans happy, I just want to do as well as we can with the club. 'Spurs are a massive club. I've always enjoyed their attacking football and I think coming from Portugal that suits me - this season I want to adapt really quickly to the Premier League and have as good a season as we can.' His winning goal at Upton Park has certainly set them on their way to that. Into the groove : Despite being born on these shores, the West Ham game was his first in the Premier League . What about international honours? Dier, who speaks Portuguese as fluently as English, had been asked to consider playing for Portugal but FIFA rules prevented him doing this until he turned 18. It allowed England to seize the opportunity when he signed for Everton back in 2011 and Dier made his debut for the Three Lions in an Under 18 match with Slovakia in November that year. He quickly established himself as a regular at Under 19 level the following season and committed to the country of his birth. International quality: Dier has been a regular in a number of England youth side and could now step up . Despite being a year younger than most of his squad mates, he played a full part as England reached the semi-finals of the 2012 European Championships in Lithuania. That performance ensured a place at the 2013 Under 20 World Cup and Dier was duly named in Peter Taylor's World Cup squad. He made his first appearance for the Under 21 team on August 13, 2013 in a 6-0 thrashing of Scotland at Bramall Lane in Sheffield. What are his strengths? The first thing you notice is that Dier is far more than a standard centre-half. While this is his preferred position, he can also operate at right-back and in defensive midfield. This versatility is matched by good aerial ability (Dier is 6ft 2in), reading of the play, strength and tackling. Impressing in training: Dier nicks the ball away from Nathan Redmond while on international duty . He must have some sporting pedigree? Yes he does. Dier is the great nephew of Peter Croker, who played in the 1947 FA Cup final for Charlton Athletic. His granddad is Ted Croker, a former secretary of the Football Association between 1973 and 1989 and also an ex-president of Cheltenham Town. His father Jeremy is a former professional tennis player who appeared at Wimbledon in the 1980s. How far can he go? Dier has made the perfect start to his Spurs career and can look forward to more appearances in the season to come. With Spurs chasing trophies on a number of fronts, depth in their squad is essential and the 20-year-old has already shown he can cut it in the Premier League. Manager Mauricio Pochettino proved at Southampton that he is willing to put faith in youth and Dier will be at the centre of his plans. He will continue to play for England's Under 21s in their European Championship campaign and, if his good form can be sustained, may well get a call-up into Roy Hodgson's senior squad.

"Between the baking, stacking and frosting herself, one Queensland mother thought it would be a lot easier to order her two daughters’ shared birthday cupcakes off Facebook. When Nicole Williams found a cake making and decorating ad through a classified section in Bundaberg, in Central Queensland, she was convinced that ‘Cup n Cakes by Ally’ would deliver what they had advertised. But when the mother-of-three opened the box after the birthday dinner, her youngest daughter Kayla-Jaye, 4, was left in tears. The 28-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that her cupcakes looked nothing like the photos advertised or described on the Facebook page. Nicole Williams made an order with Cup n Cakes by Ally, who promised the same Frozen design made by TheCakingGirl (pictured top) but when she opened the box, it looked nothing like she wanted (pictured bottom) ‘She had a lot of designs advertised so I told her that I wanted Pepper Pig ones and she said “I have no problems with doing that” and claimed she had previously made Pepper Pig cakes and even sent me photos to prove it,’ Ms Williams said. Ms Williams agreed to pay $50 for two sets of cupcakes before they were made and she picked them up at the woman’s home, who lives just around the corner from her dad. ‘All I had to do was place the order through her page, pay for it and I didn’t have to queue in line through a bakery and flick through a lot of magazines to decide what I wanted. Ms Williams said the lady even sent her a picture of her previous Pepper Pig cupcakes that she made but the ones she got was nothing like the photos . But when Ms Williams opened the boxes at a restaurant after the birthday dinner, she was outraged. ‘They looked gross – Kayla-Jaye wanted the Disney’s Frozen movie characters on her cupcakes but she started crying after she saw the face of the snowman,’ she said. ‘It didn’t look like a cuddly snowman. It looked more like it came out of a horror movie – it was really scary. ‘It was nothing like the pictures she had advertised and I’m pretty sure they weren’t baked that day because they tasted stale and dry. ‘It’s disappointing because my children were upset and I had to rush out and get new cupcakes, which only cost me $5.50 at a supermarket and they tasted delicious.’ Cody Brown, 20 and his partner Chloe Davis, 20, also had a similar experience when they ordered their cake through the same business . CAKE FAIL: Another mother was outraged when she ordered this baby dinosaur cake (left) but got something completely different (right) When Ms Williams asked for her money back, the woman claimed she had photo evidence of her children eating them. ‘I was really confused because I don’t have pictures of my kids eating them but she said I wasn’t entitled for a refund and started ignoring all my messages.’ Cody Brown, 20 and his partner Chloe Davis, 20, also had a similar experience when they ordered their cake through the same business. ‘Chloe spoke to the lady through Facebook and asked if she could make a dinosaur cake for our brother-in-law, Freedom Healey who is 21 and has a disability,’ Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We even sent her a picture of what we wanted and the lady said she could make it.’ Random act of kindness: The couple was later approached by two strangers on Facebook, who offered to make the dinosaur cakes without charging . The couple was asked to pay $65 upfront but after the cake was ready to be picked up, the woman sent the couple a picture of what the cake looked like. ‘It looked disgusting and we didn’t want it. ‘But she refused to give us a refund and Chloe tried talking to her through Facebook and then she gave us two options – to take the cake or get a refund of $25. ‘Chloe posted the picture on the woman’s page so everyone could see what she was trying to do. Another prime example of some global cake fails that has surfaced on social media. One baker attempted to make a Little Mermaid cake but found it was harder than it looked . ‘All these other people started commenting and saying ‘that’s not right’ and eventually she showed up on Chloe’s mother’s front door and refunded all our money. ‘She was really rude to us and we had to go through a lot of trouble to get it back. ‘If you’re going to promise people, make sure you know how to make a cake properly.’ Not everyone can perfect the art of cake making. Another baker tried to make some Cookie Monster cupcakes . Cookie Monster: 'Me want cookie! Me eat cookie! Om nom nom nom' CAKE FAIL: Is this meant to be a melting yellow snowman with a raw carrot nose cake? The couple was later approached by two strangers on Facebook, who offered to make the dinosaur cakes without charging. ‘It was a random act of kindness - These people went out of their way to make us two different dinosaur cakes after they had seen how disgusting the other cake looked. Cup n Cakes by Ally has since been removed from Facebook and Daily Mail Australia could not contact for any  comments.
