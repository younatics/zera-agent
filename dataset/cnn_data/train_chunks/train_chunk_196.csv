"(CNN) -- Surrounded by the white-clad students of her all-girls academy, Oprah Winfrey is glowing with pride. And just like many mothers at a graduation ceremony, the talk show queen cannot hold back the tears as the girls she calls her daughters stroll across the stage to accept their diplomas. ""I am one proud mama and for once I think I know what that feels like for real,"" Winfrey said before the graduation of the first class of her South Africa-based school last week. ""It feels like a real sense of accomplishment. It is a triumph indeed, considering where all these girls have come from."" The TV star had every reason to be jubilant: In 2007, she had hand-picked all these students as she established the $40 million Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls to provide world-class high school education to underprivileged children from South Africa and teach them leadership skills. Five years later, the 71 graduates of the class of 2011 -- all high-achieving young girls who had experienced poverty and personal trauma such as violence, molestation, or loss of a parent -- have all been accepted to continue their studies at universities in South Africa and the United States. Oprah: Power, money and compassion . ""When I look at them, I see where they've been, I see where they've come from. I know how hard it is to come up from nowhere and nothing and have almost no support and to have suffered not one or two but on average five, six traumas by the time you actually get in this school,"" said Winfrey. ""And now 100% of this class has been accepted into colleges, 10% going to the United States. I mean, that's pretty incredible."" Before the graduation, the girls received intensive financial planning counseling and assistance to help them with life beyond the academy, school officials say. A mentoring program has also been put in place to offer them advice during university. Overall, the boarding school, which spans 52 acres in the small town of Henley-on-Klip near Johannesburg, accommodates 400 South African girls of any race, color or origin, aged 12 to 18. The students are offered free tuition, uniforms and meals and have access to the academy's state-of-the-art facilities, which include modern classrooms, computers labs, sport fields and a 10,000-volume library. Elite boarding school aims to create Africa's future leaders . But for all its success and money spent, Winfrey's academy has not been without its controversies. A few months after opening, the school was rocked by an abuse scandal when one of its matrons was accused of molesting students. The women was acquitted in 2010. Last year, a student concealed her pregnancy and then secretly gave birth at the school. The baby died and was later found in the student's school bag. Winfrey, who lost a child as a teenager and has spoken publicly about abuse she suffered at a young age, said it was her faith in the girls that kept her ""steadfast"" and ""stimulated"" amid all the challenges. ""I've always believed in the girls,"" she said. ""I've known that no matter what we were going through, the girls were worth it -- no matter what happened, the end of the day the girls, the investment in the girls, which is really an investment in the future leadership of this country."" Africa's emerging leaders launch 2020 growth vision . The 57-year-old media mogul, who now runs her own channel, appropriately titled OWN, said her next mission is to continue championing the rights of young girls to a better education. She aims to use the experience garnered over the past five years as a ""force for change"" to give educational opportunities to more girls from poor backgrounds in other countries and help raise the next generation of female leaders and entrepreneurs. ""You want to change the world, you change a girl's life,"" she said. ""What I intend to do now is ... take that model and to use it in the world to change the lives of 250 million girls around the world who can't get an education, who don't have any asset other than their bodies to use, and therefore they're sold for dowries, they're sold off into slavery, they're married at 11 and 12 years old."" Winfrey, who overcame economic hardship as well as racial and gender challenges to become one of the world's most successful and influential women, says education can help girls from all backgrounds to raise their aspirations. ""In the beginning, I think we had teachers who were like, 'oh, the girls, they come here disadvantaged.' So we've eliminated that word 'disadvantaged,' because disadvantaged allows other people to look at you like you have some kind of disease, and they lower their expectations for what you can be. ""I said, 'nobody has a disadvantaged brain. Nobody is here with a disadvantaged mind. Nobody has a disadvantaged spirit.' "" For this ""proud momma,"" the possibilities are endless for her girls. ""You were born in the year that apartheid ended in this country,"" Winfrey tells her school's students. ""That means that you are a child of freedom. There is no bar.""","The first class of Oprah Winfrey's South Africa-based academy has graduated .

"(CNN) -- Portugal is eliminating four holidays to try to boost its economy, the government announced -- but only after getting the agreement of the Vatican. The economically struggling European country will stop giving workers a day off for Corpus Christi and All Saints' Day, starting next year, the government said. It will also eliminate two civil holidays to be fair, the statement said Tuesday. The center-right government thanked the Holy See and the Portuguese Bishops' Conference for their ""constructive approach"" to the negotiations. Portugal and the Vatican will re-evaluate the agreement in five years, the government said. Economy ministry spokesman Hugo Soares declined to say how cutting the holidays would boost the economy. The opposition Socialists and Communists did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Portugal, a largely Catholic country, is struggling with recession and debt. Along with the economies of Greece, Italy, Ireland and Spain, its economy is a cause for concern across the 17 countries that use the euro as their currency.","Portugal's government consults the Holy See before canceling vacation days .

"(CNN) -- As Jane Austen's classic comedy of manners, ""Pride and Prejudice"" reaches 200, its heroine Elizabeth Bennet is being hailed as one of literature's best-loved ladies. But which other fictional women do we love, admire or sometime fear? Who are the powerful, striking and independent women fighting hardest for our attention through the pages of literature? The Leading Women team has drawn up an entirely subjective list of some of our favorite fictional heroines. But we know you'll have other ideas. We'd love to hear your favorites in the comments box below. They are (in no particular order): . Jo March . ""Little Women,"" by Louisa May Alcott (1868) Why we love her: Like her creator, Jo March is one of four sisters living in 19th century New England, and most critics agree she is the one who most closely resembles Alcott. Jo is a tomboy, strong-minded and independent, at a time when girls were more often expected to stay at home. The spin-off: In the 145 years since it was written, ""Little Women"" has been made into at least three feature films (with Jo played by Katharine Hepburn in 1933, June Allyson in 1949 and Winona Ryder in 1994), several TV series and even a Japanese animated television series. Sample quote: ""If I weren't going to be a writer I'd go to New York and pursue the stage. Are you shocked?"" Anna Karenina . ""Anna Karenina,"" by Leo Tolstoy (1873) Why we love her: Rebellious and unhappily married socialite Karenina begins an affair with the dashing Count Vronsky.Their passion pits them against the norms of 19th century Russian high society and forces Karenina to make stark choices about how to live a fulfilling life. The spin-offs: A 2012 film starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law is the latest in a long line of adaptations for the big and small screen. Sample quote: ""I simply want to live; to cause no evil to anyone but myself"" Hermione Granger . ""Harry Potter"" series, by J.K.Rowling (2001) Why we love her: The brightest of the main characters, Granger starts the series as an annoying know-it-all, but grows into a smart beauty, who is determined and loyal to her friends. J.K.Rowling has described Granger of an exaggeration of her own youth. The spin-offs: The series of seven ""Harry Potter"" books, all adapted into major films made J.K.Rowling a multi-millionaire. Granger was played on screen by Emma Watson. Sample quote: ""Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery."" Mariam . ""A Thousands Splendid Suns,"" by Khaled Hosseini (2007) Why we love her: Married against her will at the age of 15 to an abusive man 30 years her senior in Kabul, the novel doesn't start well for Mariam.Twenty years later, when 15-year-old Laila moves into her household as her husband's second wife, the two women strike up a deep bond against a backdrop of Taliban brutality and war in Afghanistan. The spin-offs: Columbia Pictures is expected to make a movie, scheduled for release in 2015. Sample quote: ""Why have you pinned your little heart to an old, ugly hag like me?"" She murmurs into Aziza's hair. ""Huh? I am a nobody, don't you see? A dehati. What have I got to give you?"" She has found in this little creature the first true connection in her life of false, failed connections. Jane Eyre . ""Jane Eyre,"" by Charlotte Bronte (1847) Why we love her: After a rotten childhood in 19th century England, Jane Eyre becomes a governess and falls in love with her employer, Mr Rochester.She's a strong and complex character who manages to get back on her feet after countless setbacks. The spin-offs: The most famous of its many film adaptations are a 1943 version starring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine and a 2011 version with Mia Wasikowska in the title role. Sample quote: ""I have now been married 10 years. I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blest -- blest beyond what language can express."" Lady Macbeth . ""Macbeth,"" William Shakespeare (1611) Why we love her: You can't love Lady Macbeth, perhaps, but there is something to admire in her ruthless determination.Lady Macbeth urges her husband to kill the King of Scotland to seize the crown herself. Ultimately, though, she falls victim to guilt and madness. The spin-offs: Macbeth is arguably the best-known play by the world's best-known playwright and has hardly been off the stage since it was first performed in 1611. Sample quote: Discussing the arrival of King Duncan, the ambitious and often ruthless Lady Macbeth illustrates how far she is willing (and ready) to go to seize the throne.""Come, you spirits . That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, . And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full . Of direst cruelty."" Aibeleen Clark . ""The Help,"" by Kathryn Stockett (2009) Why we love her: Aibeleen is a black maid raising her 17th white child in 1960s Mississippi, while nursing the pain of losing her own son.When she finds the courage to tell her story to an aspiring writer, she inspires others to do the same and unleashes big waves in a small community. The spin-offs: Aibeleen was played by Viola Davis in the successful 2011 film adaptation. Sample quote: ""We ain't ... we ain't doing civil rights here. We just telling stories like they really happen."" Scout Finch . ""To Kill a Mocking Bird,"" by Harper Lee (1960) Why we love her: Scout is the narrator of this much-loved Pulitzer Prize-winning novel dealing with racial injustice in the American Deep South.As a tomboyish child, Scout is able to ask questions that an adult can't while trying to make sense of the events she witnesses. The spin-offs: It was made into a film in 1962, with Scout played by a 10-year-old Mary Badham. Sample quote: ""I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received the impression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the sense they had, but Aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was."" Dominique Francon . ""The Fountainhead,"" by Ayn Rand (1943)Why we love her: Set in a man's world of architects in 1920s and 30s New York City, Dominique has a pessimistic world view, which leads to her marry two men she despises. She eventually learns to find happiness with a man she loves and accept a more positive view on society. Sample quote: ""Ask anything of men. Ask them to achieve wealth, fame, love, brutality, murder, self-sacrifice. But don't ask them to achieve self-respect. They will hate your soul."" Masami Aomame . ""1Q84,"" by Haruki Murakami (first published in Japanese, 2009. English translation 2011) Why we love her: Aomame lives an alternate reality as an assassin in a fictionalized Tokyo of 1984 avenging victims of domestic violence.Her strange world eventually converges with that of a man she fell in love with when they were both 10 years old. It's not conventional reading, but if you can make sense of it, you'll probably love Aomame. The spin-offs: The latest offering from superstar author Murakami has been enormously successful in Japan. No news of adaptations so far. Sample quote: ""If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then there's salvation in life. Even if you can't get together with that person.""","Pride and Prejudice celebrates its 200th birthday this week .

"(CNN) -- The political gridlock that has impeded progress on Japan's myriad policy challenges may be broken at long last. With their thumping victory in the Upper House of Japan's parliament -- known as the Diet -- the ruling coalition, led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), now effectively controls the country's legislative body. But now there are no excuses; power brings responsibility and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has to deliver on all the promises and pledges that have piled up over the past several months. Abe is credited with helping the Japanese economy regain its mojo after two decades of stagnation, but it's not time for any ""mission accomplished"" complacency. So-called ""Abenomics"" involves three policy ""arrows"" -- extreme monetary easing, massive fiscal stimulus and sweeping structural reforms. The first two arrows represent the low-hanging fruit because quantitative flooding and ratcheting up public works spending face no organized opposition. Igniting the stock market, however, is the easy part and remains a fragile success; when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke mentioned ""tapering"" global markets, including Japan's Nikkei, swooned. Abe's recovery strategy aims to reflate the economy and boost consumption, but structural reforms are the key to a sustainable growth strategy. This third arrow remains a work in progress. When Team Abe unveiled a beta version of its structural reforms in June, markets reacted badly because there was nothing sweeping about the tentative measures. There is widespread and justifiable concern that Abe will have a tough time enacting bold structural reforms and anything less than audacious will disappoint markets and undermine positive trends and perceptions. Abe needs to take on the vested interests in Japan that have much to lose, but they are well represented in his LDP. Can he maintain party discipline and provide the leadership that Japan has lacked since Junichiro Koizumi's tenure as premier (2001-2006)? Back in the driver's seat, the LDP may no longer feel the same sense of urgency about structural reforms and powerful constituents will lobby the party to water down or abandon aggressive revamping. Japan is participating in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a market-opening deal that involves the United States and several smaller economies in the Asia-Pacific region. The farming lobby opposes opening Japan's agricultural market and last year when former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda proposed joining the TPP, he was handed a ""forget about it!"" petition with eleven million signatures. That's a lot of reasons to believe that the TPP's ""no sacred cows"" approach to market opening may prove a deal breaker for Japan. Agriculture may generate only 1% of Japan's GDP, but its aging, part-time farmers are overrepresented in the Diet and are loyal supporters of the LDP. Market opening enjoys the support of Japan's leading exporters, the global marquee firms that are industry leaders, but exports represent only about 13% of Japan's GDP. Domestic firms are not as competitive and are very anxious about the prospects of market opening measures, while the medical lobby is painting Armageddon scenarios about the consequences for national health care insurance, something that Japan's aging society wants to protect from the vagaries of impersonal market forces. Structural reforms face other serious headwinds. Can the LDP push through comprehensive deregulation of the electricity market against the regional monopolies? Why does Japan pay 4-5 times the global price for LNG imports? Abe also faces stiff public opposition over his plans to restart the nation's idled nuclear reactors. He is seen to be in the ""nuclear village's"" pocket, the vested interests in business and bureaucratic circles that advocate nuclear energy. But some 70% of the Japanese public favors phasing out nuclear power because of lingering safety concerns; 150,000 people remain displaced by the three reactor meltdowns in 2011. Moreover, TEPCO's ongoing clean-up at the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has been marred by a series of screw-ups worthy of the Keystone cops and there are concerns that new safety guidelines may be trumped by political expediency. Abe also wants to push ahead with tax and social welfare reforms that will prove divisive. He favors a big corporate tax cut, but the Ministry of Finance is worried about fiscal rehabilitation; Japan's public debt to GDP ratio is 240%. He is also undecided about proceeding with a planned hike of the sales tax for fear it will stifle the nascent recovery. Plans to cut social welfare benefits reinforce growing perceptions that Abenomics is welfare for the wealthy and that labor market deregulation will lead to a hollowing out of the middle class. While Abe says that battling deflation requires increased consumption, a recent poll shows that 90% of Japanese don't think they benefit from Abenomics, according to Japanese broadcaster, NHK TV news. After all, 38% of the entire workforce is engaged in low paid, dead-end jobs with no job security, doubling the rate two decades ago. Improving conditions for this precariat is crucial to battling deflation. Critics believe that Abe's trickle-down economics will leave the most vulnerable high and dry. Increasing productivity and wages of these workers is key to Japan's recovery. Women also remain marginalized in the workforce, where the gender-wage gap is double the OECD average and there are very few become managers. Aside from providing more day care, Abe has been vague about how he plans to make it happen for Japanese women -- but as they fare so fares Japan. All the reasons cited above reinforce the adage: ""It's the economy stupid!"" But can Abe resist his ideological and nationalist inclinations? Abe's pet project is Constitutional revision; he wants to jettison the war-renouncing Article 9 -- signed in the wake of Japan's World War II defeat to outlaw war as a means of settling future disputes -- and curtail civil liberties. But he doesn't have the votes to get it done. Opinion: Japanese politicians struggle with wartime past . So there is considerable speculation about whether Abe plans to visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in mid-August when Japan's surrender is commemorated. Since 1978, when 14 Class A war criminals were enshrined there, Emperor Showa and Emperor Akihito never visited this sacred site. Yasukuni is indelibly tarnished by associations with wartime Shinto and an unrepentant view of Japan's Asian rampage 1931-45. Abe has long supported patriotic education and an airbrushed history, one that is featured at the adjacent Yushukan Museum. There one encounters a valorizing and exonerating version of Japanese imperialism and what Indian writer Pankaj Mishra terms ""aggressive self-pity."" The national cemetery is Chidorgafuchi and that is where he and his ministers should honor the war dead. Abe has found redemption in victory and need not sully Japan's international image by trying to rehabilitate a shabby chapter in Japan's history. After all, there is much Japanese can take pride in, and the world admires about, post-war Japan as a cornerstone of regional peace and prosperity. Can the ""real"" Abe be kept under wraps? His spin-doctors offer reassurances, but Abe expresses regret that he didn't visit during his first tenure as premier (2006-2007). That was because he was busy fence-mending with China and South Korea following Koizumi's repeated visits to Yasukuni that sent Japan's regional relations into a tailspin. Abe has demonstrated that history is not his forte, but this is one lesson he ignores at his peril. Japan's most important strategic imperative is forging better ties with China and given his conservative nationalist credentials, Abe is in a good position to build a future oriented relationship. Regarding the territorial dispute with Beijing over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, Tokyo's claim that there is no dispute is a diplomatic dead-end that impedes hammering out a modus vivendi. Its time for confidence building measures, not counterproductive gestures about history; the 2008 agreement for joint development of hydrocarbon resources in the East China Sea that shelves issues of sovereignty could be a useful step forward. Is Abe up to the job or will he lurch backward? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Kingston.","Shinzo Abe's recovery strategy aims to reflate the economy and boost consumption .

"Washington (CNN) -- Psst! Here's a truth: Politicians lie. They lie about their personal lives like Anthony Weiner did. And Eliot Spitzer. And Mark Sanford. And Bill Clinton. And John Edwards. Shall we go on? They lie about policy too. America's top spy, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper had to issue a statement explaining why he testified before Congress that the U.S. government is not gathering dossiers on American citizens when it's now clear that the U.S. government is gathering all their Internet and phone data. They lie to supporters. When some Republicans pledge to repeal Obamacare, it might be what the voters back home want to hear. But the lawmakers know it's not going to happen. Boehner says House will keep trying to stop Obamacare . They change their policies between fundraising, campaigning, and governing. President Barack Obama opposed a mandate that people get health insurance when he ran for president. But that didn't stop him from signing one into law. Was that a lie? Clapper, America's top spy, found himself admitting to giving ""erroneous"" information to Congress. He had testified at a Senate committee that the government was not collecting vast amounts of data from most Americans. ""No sir,"" Clapper said. After Edward Snowden leaked NSA secrets, Clapper was forced to write a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee and apologize. ""I have thought long and hard to recreate what went through my mind at the time,"" he said, adding that, ""My response was clearly erroneous -- for which I apologize,"" Clapper said. So maybe Eliot Spitzer told the truth about lying when he said on NBC recently, explaining why it's OK for him to run for office again after his 2011 prostitution scandal, ""I think we all know that politicians dissemble all the time about negotiations, on substantive issues and probably on personal issues as well."" A lot of baseball players have been in the news recently for lying, too. In New York, already coming to grips with the two cads running for citywide office, Alex Rodriguez's relationship with the truth is about as tenuous as his relationship with the Yankees. He had said he didn't take performance enhancing drugs (PEDs is what they're calling them these days). But he tested positive. The Milwaukee Brewers' Ryan Braun got suspended by Major League Baseball for the rest of the season. He's now admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs. That means he lied when he stood in front of TV cameras in 2012 and said, ""I'd bet my life"" PEDs didn't enter his body. They did. And Braun's life isn't over. He'll be eligible to play again next year. Let's be clear, just about everyone lies, according to the experts. And a little lying is OK. Opinion: Will 'sexting' city give Weiner a pass? ""The ones who never lie are probably the people we don't want to be around very much,"" said Robert Feldman, dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ""They tell us we're putting on weight or don't look very good that day."" ""Society socializes us to be deceptive and to tell people the kinds of things they want to hear,"" he said, adding that most people get away with most of their little lies. But little lies can beget big lies. And when someone gets away with lying enough and they can justify it to themselves, that's when you end up with bald-faced lies like Edwards saying the love child wasn't his. It was. Or Braun swearing on his life that he hadn't taken the drugs. He had. ""So most of the time we get away with our lies,"" said Feldman. ""We're not questioned and it's fairly easy to be deceptive. A lot of what we see from people who come out with these egregious kinds of lies is they have experience with getting away with being deceptive so they don't think about the consequences."" Dr. Shaul Shalvi, a psychology professor at Ben Gurion University in Israel, has studied what entices people to lie. In one experiment, participants were given a dollar each time they hit a number on a die. He found they were more likely to lie the more chances they got. ""It is easier to shuffle the facts than to invent new facts,"" he said. Why we act on stupid impulses . Perhaps Lance Armstrong justified lying about his own long-term use of performance-enhancing drugs because he was feeding his own inspirational narrative as a cancer survivor, Shalvi said. Of course, Armstrong was also enriching himself. Shalvi didn't want to offer an opinion on Weiner or Braun, but Feldman said voters should beware. ""In one sense, society seems to be encouraging people to lie. And then they do this calculus that it's not going to be that bad,"" he said, referring to Bill Clinton, who weathered his lie about having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky and today is a respected elder statesman. ""If you elect these guys and you expect them to be honest, you're deluding yourself because they have a history of deception,"" said Feldman. ""The best predictor of future behavior is what they've done in the past. If Anthony Weiner wins this election, the message is that you can do virtually anything and get away with it, multiple times.""

"Washington (CNN) -- An Air Force officer who had been in charge of a military unit aimed at preventing sexual assaults made an initial court appearance Thursday on a sexual battery charge but did not enter a plea. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, a 1994 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was arrested Sunday for allegedly grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County near the Pentagon. A police report said the unidentified woman fought off her assailant, who appeared intoxicated. After his appearance Thursday, which lasted less than a minute, the 41-year-old officer made no comments to reporters outside the Arlington County Courthouse. He has been removed from his job leading a branch of the Air Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program. Survey indicates troubling trend in military sexual assaults . Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh told Congress on Tuesday that Krusinski is a personnel officer by training and had spent the previous 2.5 years working on Air Force staff in policy. After taking the position with the sexual assault prevention unit in February, he underwent training aimed at preparing him for his duties, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. John Dorrian said. Dorrian said Krusinski's record was ""exemplary"" and contained nothing that would have precluded him from serving with the unit. Krusinski served in Iraq from November 2009 to May 2010 and in Afghanistan from August 2011 to February 2012, earning five non-combat medals during 19 years of service. Arlington County declined an Air Force request that it allow Krusinski to be prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Commonwealth's Attorney Theo Stamos said that her office has ""routinely prosecuted members of the military"" and would do so in this instance as well. ""The incident occurred in Arlington, not on a military base,"" Stamos told CNN. ""In my 26 years, I have never been asked by the government to turn over a member of the military. It doesn't make any sense,"" Stamos said. Krusinski's attorney declined comment. The arrest came two days before the Pentagon released a report showing a 6% increase in reported sexual assault cases within the military in the fiscal year that ended last September 30. Anonymous survey results collected over a two-year period ending in 2012 indicate that the increase may have been higher than that. President Barack Obama has said he will not tolerate such conduct and urged the Pentagon to step up its prevention efforts. CNN's Larry Lazo contributed to this report .","Lt. Col.

"Washington (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered two reviews of whether the military justice system is properly dispensing punishments and suitably protecting sexual assault victims, the Pentagon said Tuesday. The reviews were prompted by outrage from members of Congress over a case involving an Air Force officer found guilty last year in military court of sexual assault who was later cleared of the charges by his top commander. The judge presiding over the court-martial at Ramstein Air Base in Germany of Lt. Col. James Wilkerson sentenced him to a year in prison and kicked him out of the service. Air Force Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, Wilkerson's top commander in Europe, was the convening authority for the court-martial and reviewed the final case and sentence. Franklin overturned the decision, throwing out the charges and clearing Wilkerson's military record. He was reinstated in the Air Force earlier this year. Hagel said Franklin reviewed the case over a three-week period and used his authority under Article 60 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. ""He concluded that the entire body of evidence was insufficient to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Hagel said in a letter to Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who has been an outspoken critic of Franklin's decision. ""I believe this case does raise a significant question whether it is necessary or appropriate to place the convening authority in the position of having the responsibility to review the findings and sentence of a court-martial,"" Hagel added. Pentagon officials told CNN last week that is rare for charges to be dismissed in this manner. U.S. law says the commander's decision is final and cannot be overturned by the service secretary or the secretary of defense, Hagel told Boxer. But Hagel said that he would review the legal authorization and ordered Air Force Secretary Michael Donley and Pentagon Acting General Counsel Robert Taylor to review the case. Hagel asked that the review ""assess whether all aspects of the (code of military justice) were correctly applied and to make recommendations on how the convening authority's decision in this case could be more transparent,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little told reporters at a briefing. Little said the report to Hagel is due March 20. In a second and broader review, Hagel ordered Taylor to examine military law covering the actions of the convening authority and to see whether changes should be made. That assessment is due a week later. ""Eliminating sexual assault in the military is one of his top priorities,"" Little said about Hagel's commitment to members of Congress and military leaders. ""Sexual assault is a serious crime that has no place in the department and he will not tolerate it,"" Little added. ""Any member of the military that is convicted of sexual assault -- no matter his rank or position -- must be held appropriately accountable."" Separately, a bipartisan proposal in the U.S House would strip military commanders of the unilateral power to overturn convictions or lessen sentences handed down by judges and juries at courts-martial. ""It is time to right an egregious wrong in our military justice system. The fact that one person can overturn a punishment determined by a judge or jury flies in the face of justice. We need a military justice system for the 21st century. The one we have now is primitive and is reminiscent of a time when punishments were decided by an autocrat, not by a judge or jury,"" said Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat. Amanpour: Risking sexual assault to serve your country .

The answer is simple: It has. We can understand -- but of course not fathom -- the grief of Aaron's loving parents, of his friends and of people like me who were privileged to have known Aaron over his short years. To understand the depth of feeling among those who never met Aaron, we have to get past the convenient pegs the media have used to explain his story. For example, the media like to shorthand Aaron by calling him a ""hacker."" Yes, if by ""hacker"" we mean what software developers generally intend by the term: an exceptionally clever person who can make anything out of anything. To the general public though, it means a ""black hat"" who violates laws to get at protected information. Aaron was a builder, not a hacker in the black hat sense. The list of the projects he contributed to is prodigious, as is appropriate for a prodigy who at the age of 13 anticipated the concept of Wikipedia and at 14 was being consulted by senior technologists about a standard to ease the flow of content across the Internet. Tech: How Aaron Swartz helped build the Internet . That was just the start. Aaron went on to make serious contributions to Creative Commons (an organization that releases licenses so authors can let their work be more easily reused), Open Library (a public library of online works), Reddit (an immensely popular open discussion forum), Markdown (a simple way to write Web pages), web.py (making it easier for developers to create Web applications), Jottit.com (type-and-post website) and much more. But you can't explain the Internet's grief simply by referring to Aaron's unearthly technical prowess. You may notice a pattern in the projects Aaron worked on: They're about making it easier to share information on the Internet. That's what got him in trouble with a reckless prosecutor who wanted to put him in jail for 35 years for downloading millions of academic research articles from a provider -- JSTOR -- that puts no limits on how many articles subscribers can download and that did not want to prosecute him. Earlier, Aaron had participated in making public court records much more readily available online. Yet it would be a mistake to peg Aaron only as a liberator of information for the public good. He also built services to enable social interactions around information and ideas, because that's how ideas have effect in the world. Aaron had a deep sense of the Internet as the site of a new culture of ideas, connection and play. But it would also be a mistake to peg Aaron simply as a champion of social connectedness. He was that, but he was also a hardheaded fighter for justice. He was acutely aware of the advantages conveyed by accidents of birth: country, race, class, gender, sexuality and more. Access to information and to one another were, to Aaron, tools in the struggle to lessen the world's raw unfairness. Swartz's suicide sparks talk about depression . Still, thinking of Aaron mainly as a software activist is one more peg we should undo. The world has rarely seen an intellect as voracious and comprehensive as Aaron's. He was a seeker after first causes and had the mental prowess to plow through massive amounts of information and ideas, simultaneously considering the data, the pragmatics, the theory, and the theory of theory. His insight helped inspire Lawrence Lessig's Harvard-based anti-corruption campaign (Rootstrikers) and two groundbreaking progressive grass-root organizations (Demand Progress and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee). From these platforms, and with his remarkable skills as a writer, he was able to play a crucial role in alerting the Net to the dangers of the Stop Online Piracy Act that would have given the government more power to shut down sites at the blink of the content industry's stink eye. Put this together and you still don't have that which the Net is mourning. Aaron didn't just contribute ferociously to the Net. It wasn't just that he was persecuted out of all proportion for trying to contribute more. Above all, he embodied what is best and hopeful about the Internet: its endless information, its ethos of sharing, its joy in connecting friends and strangers, its unflinching transparency about its own limitations, its promise -- by no means yet delivered -- of a world that is more open, more knowledgeable, and, above all, more fair ... a world that reflects the values of the Internet at its best. That is why the Internet is so wracked with sadness. That is why we will never forget Aaron Swartz. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Weinberger.","David Weinberger: With Aaron Swartz's suicide, something essential about the Net has died .

"(CNN) -- As expected, Katie Couric is leaving CBS Evening News, her representative, Matthew Hiltzik, told CNN on Tuesday. After weeks of speculation, Couric broke the news in an exclusive interview with People magazine. ""The bottom line is that I love doing all kinds of different stories,"" Couric told People. ""I have a lot of areas of interest and I want to be able to fulfill all of that."" Couric told People she is considering a show format that will allow her to ""engage in in more multidimensional storytelling."" She said details are still being worked out. Couric, 54, took over the CBS news show in 2006.

"(CNN) -- It started off as a letter, but for former Marine Joshua Boston it was more than that. It was about his freedom. The Afghanistan veteran wrote an open letter to U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, saying that he would not register his weapons with the government even if a ban on assault weapons is passed. The letter started on CNN iReport and gained mass attention online, obtaining a quarter-million views as of Friday evening and appearing on several other news outlets. Boston said he was inspired to send in the iReport because he felt as though some gun owners were being unfairly targeted. He is angered by ""the fact that I'm supposed to be punished for doing nothing more than owning a rifle that looks scary because its stock isn't made out of wood,"" he said. Feinstein has said she plans to introduce a bill in January that would place a ban on assault weapons. Gun rights legislation gained renewed attention after an armed gunman killed 20 children and six adults in the Newtown school shooting. The bill aims to revisit a 1994 ban that expired in 2004. The prohibition did not eliminate assault weapons, but restricted their features, limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds and regulating pistol grips, bayonet attachments and flash suppressors. Politics: Gun owners fear new legislation could tread on their rights . Boston said he served in Afghanistan twice and Iraq twice between 2004 and 2011. Although no longer serving in the military, the 26-year-old said he still owns guns and believes the government does not need to know what guns he owns; he believes weapons registration would lead to confiscation. Many of the people who posted the more than 1,400 passionate comments about the letter said they agreed with Boston. Both pro- and anti-gun supporters weighed in on the idea of registering weapons in the United States and the use of assault weapons. ""I, like you am a former Marine corporal and I support you 110%,"" wrote CNN iReport user TMuttDaddy. ""It's nobody's business how many guns I own. I also support restoring the gun ownership right for felons. Provided the crime was nonviolent and not repeat offenders. I do think we need to address how firearms are stored and secured. We need to require owners to secure their weapons in such a way that makes them difficult to steal. I suggest gun safes and trigger locks. We need to do all we can to keep guns off the street."" iReport: Why would someone own a military-style rifle? Str8shot wrote, ""This is absolutely the best response to the attack on civilian gun ownership that I've seen in some time."" ""I'd stand, proudly, with this man in preserving our rights. He clearly understood his pledge to protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic and sounds like he'll do it. I'm right there with him!"" Despite the number of mass shootings in the United States in 2012, Boston said he believes the laws already set in place for gun control are plenty. He adds that more laws will simply remove a means of defense for people. ""I own the guns I own because I acknowledge mankind's shortcomings instead of pretending like they don't exist,"" Boston wrote. ""There are evil men in this world and there just may be a time when I need to do the unthinkable to protect me or my family."" But many commenters disagreed with Boston's take. ""I respect gun usage to a point when they are use (sic) with respect and with common sense,"" wrote iReporter RindaLynn. ""Guns do not save people. People choosing not to use guns save people,"" RindaLynn added. Opinion: Case for gun rights is stronger than you think . YankCT highlighted the value of Boston's military contributions even while disagreeing with his views. ""Ms. Feinstein is an elected official who was selected by voters to represent their interests in a governing body,"" YankCT wrote. ""She has the authority and responsibility to do just that until the people whom she represents decide otherwise through their votes. This gentleman believes that he is above the law. This is untrue; in fact, my guess is that he swore to defend the country and respect its laws when he entered the Marines."" At points in his letter, Boston addresses the senator directly: . ""I am not your subject,"" he writes. ""I am the man who keeps you free. I am not your servant. I am the person whom you serve. I am not your peasant."" In response to Boston's letter, Feinstein released this statement: . ""Senator Feinstein respects Cpl. Boston's service. She has heard from thousands of people -- including many gun owners -- who support her plan to stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of assault weapons and large capacity magazines, strips and drums that hold more than 10 rounds. Â As Senator Feinstein has said, the legislation will be carefully focused to protect the rights of existing gun owners by exempting hundreds of weapons used for hunting and sporting purposes."" A reader called freddieman said he was inspired to send his own senators a message. He said he is a veteran and comes from a military family. ""I will not lose my rights because those who do not follow the laws and freedoms of this land choose not to follow,"" he said. Analysis: Guns and the law .

"(CNN) -- Just days after ""Titanic"" director James Cameron traveled to the bottom of the sea, another wealthy adventurer has announced a spectacular deep ocean discovery. Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has unveiled plans to recover the F-1 engines that powered the Saturn V rocket carrying Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. ""I'm excited to report that, using state-of-the-art deep sea sonar, the team has found the Apollo 11 engines lying 14,000 feet below the surface, and we're making plans to attempt to raise one or more of them from the ocean floor,"" the billionaire investor and entrepreneur wrote. ""We don't know yet what condition these engines might be in; they hit the ocean at high velocity and have been in saltwater for more than 40 years,"" said Bezos. ""On the other hand, they're made of tough stuff, so we'll see."" Bezos said that watching that original mission as a 5-year-old in 1969 inspired him to dream big, and now he wants to undertake the huge challenge of pulling the engines up. Each of the engines weighs nearly 9 tons, and they came in a cluster of five. They provided 32 million horsepower by burning 6,000 pounds of fuel every second, and the five together put the largest rocket in history 38 miles up in under three minutes. After doing their work, the rockets plummeted into the ocean, where they have been undiscovered for four decades. NASA had some clues as to where they landed, and a piece of the debris landed on a German merchant ship, providing more clues. Robert Pearlman, a space memorabilia expert who runs CollectSpace.com, said there were a total of 65 of these engines launched. He said if the engines are able to be brought to the surface and a serial number can be found, it would be easy to authenticate the find. But bringing them up will be a challenge. ""If all five are still clumped together, it will be like trying to bring up the big part of the Titanic,"" Pearlman said. Still, it's not the first time a lost piece of the space race era has been found. NASA's Mercury 7 space capsule piloted by Gus Grissom was found and recovered in 1999. It's just the latest instance of a well-financed businessman making a big splash discovery or extreme feat. Just this week James Cameron took a solo dive to the deepest part of the ocean, while Sir Richard Branson used millions to fund his attempts to travel around the globe in a balloon. Pearlman said Bezos' announcement came as a complete surprise to the space memorabilia world. ""But that fits into the way he does business,"" Pearlman said, noting Bezos' other venture into space flight, Blue Origins, which aims to make human space flight cheaper and easier. ""Bezos and that Blue Origins have always played their cards very close to their chest and often don't share their milestones until after they have succeeded."" But profits don't seem to be behind Bezos' quest to find the F-1 engines. The rocket engines remain property of NASA and the U.S. government, and Bezos wrote that he would like to pull the engines to the surface and then have NASA put them on display at a museum in Seattle. The Saturn V engines could be priceless historically, but hard to put a cash value on. Pearlman noted that the highest price paid for a piece of space memorabilia was $2 million, paid by a Russian investor for a Soviet-era Vostok rocket. ""It's hard to imagine getting two investors to get in a bidding war at auction over them,"" said Pearlman. ""Components have sold for thousands of dollars, but they were all spare parts. But you have to have pretty deep pockets and a very big space to put something like this on display and maintain it.""","Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos wants to recover engines that propelled Apollo 11 .

"(CNN) -- As the summer ocean waves wash up onto America's beaches, we find ourselves thinking, nervously, about Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" and the paralyzing fear that sharks inspire in us. Yet, paradoxically, we celebrate global attempts to protect the declining number of sharks. The world has figured out we need these species, along with all creatures of the Earth, to maintain a delicately balanced ecosystem. Sharks, in particular, are ""in"" these days. Thanks to good public policy and the power of public education and multimedia campaigns featuring stars such as Yao Ming, Jackie Chan and Ang Lee, killing sharks for shark fin soup is no longer cool. The demand has been rising for decades, threatening sharks with extinction -- up to 100 million sharks are killed each year just for their fins. But we have started to reverse the trend, particularly in affluent areas of the U.S. and overseas where restaurants once proudly displayed shark fin delicacies on the menu. In California, and other states, a ban on the sale and possession of shark fin soup has gone into effect this year after aggressive marketing campaigns by WildAid and other organizations. Overseas, marketing and public diplomacy efforts featuring posters on public transportation systems and TV ads have been underway for the past few years. These efforts all show signs of success, on both the supply side and the demand side of trade in shark fins. Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department tracked 3,100 metric tons of shark fin being imported from the island to China last year, but this year's numbers are way down. Stopping the killing of sharks is part of a broader movement to stop the killing of wild animals and the trafficking of wildlife products around the world -- products that come from poaching elephants, tigers and rhinos, in addition to killing marine life. Opinion: Elephant slaughter surges as ivory funds terror . In November, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for a global strategy to protect wildlife, raising the level of urgency to a growing national security threat. For example, the poaching of elephants in search of ivory tusks for luxury goods had became a full-scale war between poachers, who are sometimes terrorists, and governments in parts of Africa. Illegal shipments of tusks across porous borders bring in the prizes of money and weapons. Once a marginalized issue of U.S. foreign policy, Clinton and current Secretary of State John Kerry have placed wildlife trafficking at the top of the agenda, given its wide tentacles to Africa, Asia, Russia, Indonesia and consumers in almost every country. According to National Geographic, which has been tracking elephant poaching, the financial losses place the issue on the scale of global drugs and crime, with an estimated 30,000 African elephants being killed for their tusks last year -- a rate of slaughter, say wildlife experts, that could drive the animals to extinction within the century. The dwindling of African elephant populations is alarming. Much of the ivory is destined for China to make chopsticks and jewelry, and the Far East, where it can fetch upward of $1,300 a pound. Whether it is shark fin soup or ivory piano keys, killing animals is big business. Together with international partners, conservation groups, nonprofits and businesses, the United States is leading the worldwide effort to reduce demand for high-end jewelry, herbal medicines, skins, foods and other products that rely on killing animals and marine life. Working with governments through existing protocols and conventions, the U.S. is convening stakeholders to pressure those who provide sanctuary for the poachers or allow parts and goods to make their way out of countries to market. Public diplomacy and public education, together with sound policy, give us a model for success. Using Facebook, Twitter, public service advertisements, the media, celebrity interviews, videos and classroom teaching, we can martial the forces to convince consumers that buying products that come from slaughtered elephants or harpooned sharks is simply wrong and dangerous. And we can track the results of wildlife trafficking and punish the offenders. This is one of those rare international tales of where the public and private sector, along with Hollywood, can create a very different kind of movie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tara Sonenshine.","Tara Sonenshine: As China gets richer, demand for shark skin soup rising .

"(CNN) -- ""Stop and smell the roses."" If you're like me -- and the millions of other workaholics in America -- this line elicits an immediate eye roll and a visceral reaction of: ""You have got to be kidding me. How can I stop and smell the roses with all the work I need to get done?!"" What can I say? I work a lot and I enjoy it. I barely stop working on vacations. My body may be sitting on a beautiful beach, but my mind will still be racing ahead planning my next work-related move like I'm a player in the career version of, ""Game of Thrones."" But then I read an article a few months ago that had a profound impact on me. This article shared the observations of a nurse who had cared for dying patients on their deathbed. She documented their regrets as they reflected upon their lives and their impending demise. Did these people -- faced with their own mortality -- express their disappointment over not putting in more hours at work? Did they lament over work-related e-mails they wished they had answered or express remorse over business meetings they missed attending? Nope. In fact, she found the opposite. The No.2 most common regret expressed to the nurse -- and the number one regret of men under her care -- was: ""I wish I hadn't worked so hard."" As the nurse noted, ""This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children's youth and their partner's companionship."" The nurse also shared the other common regrets articulated by her patients, such as their disappointment in not pursing their dreams, failing to have the courage to express their true feelings and not allowing themselves to be happy. But of all of these, the one that struck me the deepest was: ""I wish I hadn't worked so hard."" I thought about this for a while, letting this deathbed regret percolate in my mind. My wiring is to work all the time -- partly because I actually enjoy it (or at least I believe I do) and partly because I inherited my Palestinian father's immigrant work ethic. (Which is tempered slightly by my mother's Italian culture that emphasizes enjoying life.) I wondered if it would be possible for me to truly ""stop and smell the roses""? After a great deal of introspection, I came to this candid conclusion: No, I couldn't -- and I doubt others like me could either. But I do believe that I'm capable of ""slowing down and smelling a rose or two."" So this summer, I have decided to carve out moments from my work in the areas of standup comedy, writing and producing to relax a bit -- maybe even have some semblance of a social life. For those not swayed yet to join my ""smell a rose or two this summer"" campaign, you should be aware that there are actual tangible benefits to giving yourself some down time. As the Mayo Clinic notes, simple relaxation can reduce stress and improve your health. Take a yoga class, meditate or learn muscle relaxation techniques that literally only take a few minutes a day to perform -- these all help reduce stress. And for those who will only consider relaxing more because it means you will be better at your job, you are in luck. A study in the Journal of Epidemiology found that people who worked 35 to 40 hours per week, as opposed to 55-plus hours, were better at problem-solving and had better short-term memory. Bottom line: Lowering hours worked per week can make you more productive. But wait, there's more: A 2012 study, which examined the actual benefits of ""stopping to smell the roses,"" found that people who appreciated the blessings in their lives tended to be happier. Thus, appreciating the ""roses"" in your life -- be they relationships, family, or even the beauty of nature -- will likely lift your spirits and increase your happiness. The summer of 2013 officially begins this week. What's going to be for you this summer? More work, more e-mails, more meetings? Or will it be a summer where you allow yourself to slow down a bit -- just a bit -- to have some fun, to relax and to appreciate the nice things in your life? I think it's best put by a famous line from the movie, ""Inception"": ""Do you want to take a leap of faith, or become an old man [or old woman], filled with regret, waiting to die alone?"" I have made my choice. What about you? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","A nurse said that the number one regret of dying men is that they wished they worked less .

"(Rolling Stone) -- On July 25th, 1965, Bob Dylan walked onstage at the Newport Folk Festival, plugged in his 1964 sunburst Fender Stratocaster and tore through a scorching three-song set. It was a crucial turning point in his career, and it quickly became rock & roll legend -- the moment when Dylan transformed from a protest folkie to a rebel genius. But the guitar Dylan played on that mythic afternoon went missing for the next 47 years -- until recently, when a team of PBS researchers told New Jersey resident Dawn Peterson that she had it in her home. Peterson's late father, Victor Quinto, was a private pilot who worked for Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, in the mid-1960s. ""After one flight, my father saw there were three guitars left on the plane,"" she says. He contacted the company a few times about picking the guitars up, but nobody ever got back to him."" Last fall, Peterson asked PBS's History Detectives to help verify her find. The 1964 Stratocaster came with 13 pages of typed and handwritten song lyrics tucked inside its guitar case -- but host Wes Cowan was skeptical at first. ""It's so important, historically and culturally, that I couldn't have imagined Bob Dylan would have just left it on an airplane,"" he says. In fact, Dylan says that's not what happened. ""Bob has possession of the electric guitar he played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965,"" his attorney, Orin Snyder, said in a statement. ""He did own several other Stratocaster guitars that were stolen from him around that time, as were some handwritten lyrics."" But experts make a strong case that the guitar in question is the same one Dylan played at the festival in 1965. Vintage-instrument specialist Andy Babiuk was convinced after PBS asked him to compare it to close-up color photos from Newport. ""The more I looked, the more they matched,"" Babiuk says. ""The rosewood fingerboard has distinct lighter strips. Wood grain is like a fingerprint. I'm 99.9 percent sure it's the guitar -- my credibility is on the line here."" History Detectives also called in Dylan memorabilia collector Jeff Gold, who often helps auction houses authenticate items for sale. 'A vast percentage of the stuff I get shown isn't real,' he says. 'By nature, I'm a defeatist. But this was obviously real.' The lyrics that came with the guitar are evocative fragments: ""There's bullets in my eyes but I still can see/It's just these headaches that are killing me."" A handful of lines appeared on tracks that Dylan recorded for Blonde on Blonde in 1965 and 1966. ""I own a manuscript of 'Absolutely Sweet Marie,' and there's this line, 'the six white horses,' "" Gold says. ""In one of these manuscripts, Dylan had written 'six flying horses,' and then above 'flying' he'd written 'white' and 'the.' It was obvious the same person had written both of them."" Other fragments within the lyrics wound up on ""Medicine Sunday,"" an early version of the Blonde on Blonde song ""Temporary Like Achilles."" The episode of History Detectives (which also includes a brief interview with this reporter) airs on PBS Tuesday July 17th at 9:00 PM EST. If it's real, the guitar is estimated to be worth as much as $1 million -- but does Peterson legally own it? Maybe not. ""It's his guitar until he makes an affirmative act to give it to someone else or sell it,"" says lawyer Josh Grier, who represents artists including Wilco. ""I think if they put it up to auction, Dylan has a claim to the proceeds. If he finds out beforehand, he might be able to stop from from doing it."" In 2005, Peterson wrote to Bob Dylan's management and requested that he waive any claim to the guitar. Dylan's team declined, and said that the guitar should be returned. For now, Peterson is keeping the guitar in a secure, climate-controlled environment; she has not decided whether to sell it. ""I have to discuss it more with my husband,"" she says. ""Things have crossed my mind."" See full story at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","New Jersey resident Dawn Peterson has a guitar experts believe belonged to Bob Dylan .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf should stand trial for treason, the country's prime minister said Monday. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif accused Musharraf of illegally abrogating the constitution in November 2007. That month, Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge and blacked out independent TV outlets. Musharraf said he did so to stabilize the country and to fight rising Islamic extremism. The action drew sharp criticism from the United States and democracy advocates. Pakistanis openly called for his ouster. Under pressure from the West, he later lifted the state of emergency and promised elections. When those elections came, his party was dealt a serious blow. Musharraf stepped down in August 2008 as the governing coalition began taking steps to impeach him. Raza Bokhari, a spokesman for Musharraf, accused the government of ""demonstrating recklessness in its intention to pursue unwarranted treason charges"" against him, saying the former president had served the country with ""selfless devotion and perseverance."" No love lost . It's not surprising that Sharif would call for Musharraf to be held criminally liable -- there is no love lost between the two men. In the 1990s, when Sharif was prime minister, Musharraf was military chief. Sharif feared Musharraf was plotting his ouster. He fired Musharraf in October 1999 after the army's failed invasion of Kargil, in Indian-held Kashmir. And when Musharraf was on a flight to the city of Karachi, his plane was initially denied permission to land, allegedly by Sharif. The military responded by overthrowing Sharif in a bloodless coup. Musharraf took power, and a court subsequently convicted Sharif on hijacking and treason charges. Sharif managed to negotiate a period in exile in Saudi Arabia instead of prison. He returned to Pakistan to challenge Musharraf's rule in late 2007. His party didn't win. But he waited. This year, his party won a majority of the votes, putting him back in power.","Former President Pervez Musharraf is accused of abrogating the constitution .

"London (CNN) -- A shipwreck laden with 200 tonnes of silver -- the largest haul of precious metal ever found at sea -- has been discovered in the North Atlantic. The wreck of the SS Gairsoppa, a British steamship sunk by a German U-Boat during World War II, was found 300 miles off the coast of Ireland by underwater archaeology and salvage experts Odyssey Marine Exploration. The U.S. company has explored the wreck which lies 4,700 meters down, on the sea bed, using a remotely operated submarine. It now hopes to bring the SS Gairsoppa's valuable cargo of silver bullion to the surface. Odyssey's senior project manager Andrew Craig said: ""We've accomplished the first phase of this project - the location and identification of the target shipwreck. Now we're hard at work planning for the recovery phase."" Craig said he was ""extremely confident"" the company would be able to salvage the seven million ounces of silver (200 tonnes), which was worth more than Â£600,000 in 1941. The 412ft steel-hulled SS Gairsoppa was built in 1919 for the British India Steam Navigation Company, and originally served as a cargo ship on routes to and from the Far East, East Africa and Australia. When the Second World War broke out, she was ordered into Britain's merchant navy. In February 1941, the SS Gairsoppa was traveling from Calcutta, India, to Liverpool, Britain, with a cargo of silver, tea and pig iron when she became separated from the rest of her convoy in bad weather. As the crew battled to bring the ship, which was running low on fuel, safely in to port at Galway in Ireland, she was struck by a torpedo from a German U-Boat. More than 30 of the 85 sailors on board the SS Gairsoppa are believed to have made it onto lifeboats, but only one, Second Officer Richard Ayres made it safely home, landing in Cornwall after drifting at sea for two weeks. Odyssey says it does not expect to find any human remains on the wreck. Neil Cunningham Dobson, Odyssey's Principal Marine Archaeologist, said that -- as a former merchant mariner -- the story of the SS Gairsoppa had struck a chord with him. ""Even though records indicate that the lifeboats were launched before the ship sank, sadly most of her crew did not survive the long journey to shore,"" he said. ""By finding this shipwreck, and telling the story of its loss, we pay tribute to the brave merchant sailors who lost their lives."" The company won a British government contract to search for and salvage the ship. Under the terms of the agreement, it will keep 80% of the value of any silver recovered from the wreck.","SS Gairsoppa was sunk by a German U-Boat in February 1941 .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations Tuesday urged the tiny West African country of Gambia to refrain from executing 39 more death-row inmates, after nine others were recently put to death. ""I strongly condemn the executions that took place last week in the Gambia, and call for a halt to further executions,"" said Christof Heyns, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. ""This stream of executions is a major step backwards for the country, and for the protection of the right to life in the world as a whole."" The country once had been at the forefront in the region's efforts to abolish in law and practice the death penalty, with a moratorium on the death penalty for 27 years and the abolition of capital punishment for drug offenses in April 2011, Heyns said. In fact, the sliver of a nation -- surrounded by Senegal and bordering the Atlantic Ocean -- had last executed a prisoner about 30 years ago. But President Yahya Jammeh announced the new execution policy in a speech on state media Sunday that was rebroadcast Monday. ""All punishments prescribed by law will be maintained in the country to ensure that criminals get what they deserve: that is, that those who kill are killed,"" he said. ""By the middle of next month, all the death sentences would have been carried out to the letter."" Citing what it deemed ""reliable sources,"" Amnesty International reported in a statement that eight men and one woman were taken from their prison cells Thursday and killed. Three of those allegedly executed had been sentenced for treason, and two of the nine were Senegalese, said the group. Jammeh took power in a military coup in 1994 and was elected president two years later. Gambia's human rights record has drawn steady criticism since his election, but the president has won supporters by building new hospitals, schools and other infrastructure. Heyns said the executions ""undermine previous steps towards the abolition of capital punishment in the Gambia."" ""I am concerned that death sentences were imposed in violation of major international standards, including the most serious crimes provisions. According to available evidence, the trials did not meet due process safeguards,"" Heyns said. ""The executions were carried out in secrecy, away from the public and from the families, and do not meet the requirements of transparency.""","The executions are a ""major step backwards,"" a U.N. official says .

"Cannes (CNN) -- The value of jewels stolen from an exhibition in the French resort city of Cannes on Sunday is close to $136 million -- more than twice the amount stated in earlier reports -- the Nice prosecutor's office told CNN Monday. The robbery -- the third such heist around the city since May -- happened Sunday morning at a jewelry exhibition at the Carlton Hotel, according to Philippe Vique, deputy prosecutor for organized crime in the prosecutor's office. Earlier, a Nice police official told CNN on condition of anonymity that the jewels were worth about $53 million. The robber, whose face was covered by a hat and a scarf, had a semiautomatic pistol and threatened to shoot the exhibitors and guests, Vique said. Jewelry thefts reported at Cannes . Security guards were present but unarmed, he said. No one was injured. The gems were supposed to have been on display until the end of August. The robbery follows two major jewel heists this year at events tied to the Cannes Film Festival. During the festival in May, a necklace worth $2.6 million was stolen from a hotel party shortly after jewels worth more than $1 million were stolen from a safe in a hotel room. Jeweler de Grisogono said the necklace was part of a collection making its debut. The jewels stolen in May were from the Swiss firm Chopard, which was sponsoring the festival. Notable diamond heists . CNN's Stephanie Halasz, Vladimir Duthiers and Lauren Russell contributed to this report.","A police official said earlier that the jewels were worth about $53 million .

"(CNN) -- Three self-proclaimed anarchists who plotted to blow up a bridge with plastic explosives pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court in Cleveland. After an undercover operation, the FBI arrested five suspects in the plot on April 30 of this year. The FBI called the plan an act of domestic terrorism. Ohio defendants Brandon Baxter, 20, of Lakewood, and Connor Stevens, 20, of Berea admitted their roles in a plan to remotely detonate improvised devices containing C-4 explosives, with the goal of toppling a bridge over Cuyahoga Valley National Park near Cleveland, according to Northern Ohio District U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach. Opinion: Homegrown terror isn't just Islamist . An Indianapolis conspirator, Douglas Wright, 26, also pleaded guilty Wednesday to the same charges -- conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and use of an explosive device to destroy property used in interstate commerce, said Dettelbach and Stephen Anthony, who heads the FBI field division in Cleveland. A fourth defendant, Anthony Hayne, 35, of Cleveland, pleaded guilty to the same charges in July and faces a recommended sentence of 14 to 19 years in prison. The fifth defendant, Ohio native Joshua Stafford, is undergoing examinations and awaits a competency hearing after he attempted to take his own life, according to an official with the U.S. attorney's office in Cleveland. Authorities said the defendants had considered several targets during a period of several months before settling on the bridge connecting Brecksville and Sagamore Hills in Ohio. U.S. attorney's office spokesman Mike Tobin said the three defendants who pleaded guilty Wednesday will face prison terms of from 30 years to life when they are sentenced in early November.","Three of five people arrested on April 30 plead guilty .

"Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- The opposition party in Cambodia has rejected the results of the country's national election, which handed another win to long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen. The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) said Monday the weekend balloting was marred by irregularities, and demanded an investigation. Cambodians went to the polls Sunday. According to preliminary results released by the national election commission, the opposition won 55 seats. But the number wasn't large enough to unseat the ruling Cambodian People's Party, which won 68 seats. In a statement, opposition leader Sam Rainsy said a committee -- made up of representatives of the main political parties, the election commission and foreign election monitors -- should look into ""all serious election irregularities."" Once the committee issues its findings, political leaders from both sides will find ways to ""redress the injustice done to the Cambodian people whose will has been distorted for too long,"" he said. Hun Sen has been in office for 28 years. Still, opposition groups were energized. The two main parties teamed up to form the CNRP, and hoped for strength in numbers: Enough votes to take over control from the ruling party. More than 9 million people were eligible to vote. The excitement bubbled over Friday when Rainsy returned home from exile in France. He left in 2009 to avoid prison on charges of spreading disinformation -- charges many considered politically motivated. International pressure led to him receiving a royal pardon last week. But he arrived too late to run for office. The national election committee said it worked hard to ensure the election was far. ""In preparing for the election this year, we started in the middle of 2012,"" said Tep Nytha, the secretary general of the committee, ahead of the balloting.","Hun Sen has been in office for 28 years .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The main aim of President Barack Obama's getting-to-know-you meetings with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in California is to build a personal relationship between the men who lead the world's two most powerful countries. But they have a lot of thorny issues to discuss, not least the shared challenge of what to do about North Korea. The two sides will probably repeat well-worn mantras on their desires to see the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the need to ensure stability in the region. But Obama should take a step back from the stalemate high politics and raise the case of Guk-hwa Jang. Guk-hwa is a 15-year-old North Korean orphan who was forcibly repatriated from Laos, through China to Pyongyang last month, along with eight of her young friends who were all trying to get to South Korea. These nine young refugees are unique in that we know their identities and because they got all the way to Laos before being caught and sent back. Forced to return home . But there are thousands more North Koreans who have risked their lives to leave their country, only to be caught in China and forcibly repatriated. The North Korean government makes it illegal to leave the country without state permission, and refugees we have spoken with tell us that a typical minimum punishment for repatriated citizens is a three-month interrogation which involves beatings and torture. For those suspected of having associated with South Koreans or other foreigners, involvement in religious activities, or attempts to go to South Korea, refugees tell us that the punishment is ramped up to months of forced labor or banishment to a political prison camp. The North Korean government denies human rights violations and has said that the country has ""one of the best systems for promotion and protection of human rights in the world."" Tightening security . The problem on the border is getting worse. Since Kim Jong Un came to power, there have been marked increases in border security on both sides of the Sino-North Korea border. People on the ground in the region, as well as refugees that my organization has assisted have reported that over the past 18 months physical border security has been built up on both sides, border guards have been reorganized and incentive structures changed to reduce corruption. Punishments for those caught at the border or sent back from China have been become even more severe. Chinese authorities have actively cooperated with the North Korean government in this effort by implementing security crackdowns on their side of the border that have made it increasingly difficult for activists and defection brokers to assist people fleeing from North Korea. The result is that 2012 saw a 44% drop in the number of North Korean refugees arriving in South Korea compared to 2011 (from 2,700 to 1,500). The figures so far for this year show a further 20% drop in arrivals compared to last year, according to data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification. Chinese leaders bristle when foreigners call them out on human rights issues. They counter that outsiders should not infringe on their sovereignty or meddle in their ""internal affairs."" But the Chinese government's crackdowns on North Korean refugees is by nature an international issue involving the violation of human rights of citizens of another country -- a clear abrogation of international refugee law that the Chinese government has ratified. Vulnerable people . The current heightened crackdown on North Korean refugees should give President Obama the urgency to lead the international community in voicing concern for these vulnerable people, and suggest that the Chinese government's actions will affect interpretations of what kind of superpower China aims to be, in terms of their emphasis on acting according to international law, humanitarian principles and in the interests of global human progress. For their part, the Chinese authorities should also take a longer-term, strategic view in their implementation of policy on this issue. Beijing repatriates North Korean refugees to serve the dual goals of preserving their political relationship with Pyongyang and preserving ""stability"" on both sides of the border. But such clear complicity in the North Korean government's repression of their people puts the Chinese government on the wrong side of not just international opinion and increasingly even the Chinese people's attitudes towards North Korea, but also the wrong side of history. Grassroots capitalism . North Korea is changing. The gradual breakdown of centralized control, an unstoppable grassroots capitalism, new information flows, an explosion of corruption and even demographic shifts and the rise of a ""market generation"" mean that the current system is unsustainable in the long term. North Korean refugees are playing a quiet but vital role in this bottom-up transformation of the country by acting as a bridge back into their homeland. A December 2010 survey of 396 defectors living in South Korea conducted by the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights showed that 50% maintain contact with their families in North Korea through illicit channels, accelerating flows of information and money back into the country. I personally know defectors who have sent back thousands of dollars even in their first year of resettlement in South Korea, and Professor Lankov at Kookmin University in Seoul estimates that a total of $10-15 million flows back in remittances from resettled North Korean refugees every year. This money fuels the grassroots marketization and has the effect of liberalizing and opening up North Korean society from the bottom-up, increasing the pressure for change. Pressure from within . The Chinese government has long wanted North Korea to mimic its own process of economic liberalization and opening, in order to be a more reliable economic partner and improve stability in the long term. This can be seen in the subtle and not-so-subtle hints on the need for reform that are dropped every time a top North Korean official visits their country. But Beijing has been trying this charm offensive for over a decade, and they surely now realize that North Korea's leaders listen to no foreign government and are impervious to such external pressure. The only pressure point that can really change the regime's calculus is the bottom-up pressure from their own society that no authoritarian government can ignore. If North Korean refugees are able to quietly pass through China without being actively hunted down and sent back -- as they were freer to do under a policy of ""benign neglect"" a few years ago -- then they will be able to play this bridge role and increase the pressure for change from within North Korea, which is the only kind of pressure that can effectively force the regime to innovate and adapt their governing system in a sustainable way. On the other hand, if Beijing follows Pyongyang's will and unstintingly collaborates in the repression of the North Korean people, they will enable the regime to bunker down, deny change and store up bigger problems for the future. Meanwhile Pyongyang will continue to develop its nuclear weapons and missiles and engage in periodic provocations, unsettling the region and worsening China's strategic environment, as well as their relationship with the United States, South Korea and Japan. Increasing frustration . China will also continue to hemorrhage soft power on this issue, increasing distrust with people of other countries in the region. And if and when North Korea finally does open up or reunify with the South, the people of North Korea will not easily forget the Chinese government's brazen complicity during decades of their government's repressive policies. This will create a long-term complication in China's relationship with either a reformed North Korea or a reunified Korean peninsula alike. People the world over will watch and hope that the presidents of China and the United States can develop a productive and healthy relationship in order to more effectively deal with the shared challenges that affect much of humanity. But if frank and tough discussions on both countries' roles in the world cannot happen in this setting, then where can they happen? The Chinese government is increasingly frustrated with North Korea but has always fundamentally fallen back on preserving the status quo. Obama should urge Xi and others with the power to change China's direction to reconsider their active cooperation with Pyongyang's repression of their people, particularly on the issue of forced repatriations of refugees, which only prolongs the denial of an opening which will one day become inevitable. It is not too late for the Chinese government to chart a new path on the right side of history, and be remembered as a force for positive change in North Korea rather than a collaborator in the regime's repression. Ultimately, that is not just the right thing to do; it's also the smart thing to do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sokeel Park.","Recent case of 9 North Koreans repatriated from Laos highlights human rights .

"(CNN) -- A Peruvian reality show has become part of a real-life crime drama as authorities investigate the slaying of a contestant who appeared on the program. Police found Ruth Thalia Sayas Sanchez's body Saturday, more than two months after the 19-year-old's on-air confession that she worked in a nightclub and twice accepted money for sex. Investigators uncovered evidence of poison in her body and signs that she was strangled, Peruvian Attorney General Jose Pelaez told reporters. Authorities accuse her ex-boyfriend of killing her because he felt he was entitled to some of the 15,000 soles ($5,700) she won on the show, according to police accounts reported by local media. Sayas was the first contestant on ""The Value of Truth,"" which features participants answering tough questions about their personal lives in front of an audience and loved ones. Before appearing on the show, contestants are subjected to a polygraph test to verify their responses. Pelaez said investigators were looking into the role the show could have played in Sayas' death. ""The investigation will determine whether there is some degree of responsibility, even though it seems to me that it would be a responsibility that would not have a causal relation,"" he told reporters. The teen's family has said the show did not cause her death. ""This television program has absolutely nothing to do with it,' said Freddy Sanchez Rojas, Sayas' uncle. On Sunday, the president of Peru's Radio and Television Advisory Council cited Sayas' death as she called on media in the South American country to more closely monitor the contents of their programs. ""I think there is a marked tendency in our media to convert strong and difficult news into a show so everyone can see it. There is a concept of information and news that goes against the very people covered within the report,"" President Rosa Maria Alfaro said. Facing increased scrutiny, the show's host has said the program is not responsible for her slaying. Criticism of the show is unfair, host Beto Ortiz said. ""What they are doing is giving an alibi to the defenders of a soulless criminal, because they are taking away his responsibility by saying that television creates monsters,"" he said.","A reality show contestant is found slain more than two months after she appears on TV .

"(CNN) -- Is Pfc. Bradley Manning an idealist who became disillusioned by what was being done in Iraq and elsewhere in the name of U.S. national interests, as the attorney for the former Army intelligence analyst has argued? Or is he, as the prosecution contends, a traitor who leaked classified material to WikiLeaks that he knew could assist terrorists? The formal answers to those questions, at least, will come in the anticipated verdict by a military judge, who will decide Manning's guilt or innocence in a case that has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. Authorities have accused Manning of delivering three-quarters of million pages of classified documents and videos to WikiLeaks -- which has never confirmed the soldier was the source of its information -- about everything from the U.S. military strategy in Iraq to U.S. State Department cables detailing its foreign relationships. There is little debate over the basics of the case: Manning pleaded guilty in February to 10 lesser charges related to the leaks, and spent more than an hour in court reading a statement that detailed why and how he sent classified material to WikiLeaks -- a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website. But Manning refused to plead guilty to the most serious allegations, including that of aiding enemies of the United States -- a charge that falls under the Espionage Act and carries a sentence of life in prison, if convicted. As the soldier sits in a military prison cell at Maryland's Fort Meade awaiting word of his fate, questions remain about what damage his actions caused to U.S. intelligence gathering. The answer depends on who is doing in the talking. ""Osama bin Laden asked for some of the information himself,"" the prosecutor, Army Maj. Ashden Fein, said during his closing argument Thursday, referring to the documents provided to WikiLeaks by Manning. But Manning's attorney, David Coombs, told the court Friday that despite claims that the leaks harmed national security, the Army did not make any major changes to its operation. It's a sentiment that has been echoed publicly by his supporters. ""They really have not reported any great impact. More embarrassment than anything else,"" Kevin Zeese of the Bradley Manning Support Network, an online group that supports the soldier's actions and has been raising funds for his legal defense. Embarrassing or not, the publication of the leaks rocked the U.S. government, with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying the release of the material threatened the lives of Americans and damaged foreign relationships. Prosecution witnesses have testified Manning downloaded and leaked 400,000 Pentagon field reports from Iraq and 90,0000 similar documents from Afghanistan. There evidence also was presented that he downloaded and leaked more than 250,000 State Department cables. 'Collateral Murder' video . For most people, the story began on April 5, 2010, when WikiLeaks released a video that it called ""Collateral Murder."" The video was shot from a U.S. Apache helicopter as it opened fire on a group of people in Baghdad in 2007, killing a dozen people. Among the dead were a Reuters TV news cameraman and his driver. The video showed Reuters' Saeed Chmagh survived an initial strafing by the helicopter, but apparently died when it opened fire again -- this time on people attempting to get him off the sidewalk where he lay and into a van. The footage quickly made news, elevating what was once a virtually unknown WikiLeaks to a globally recognized name. Later, a U.S. investigation into the attack found that the crew mistook the journalists' cameras for weapons while seeking out insurgents who had been firing at American troops in the area. But, according to court documents and testimony, by the time the world saw the video, Manning had already downloaded hundreds of thousands of classified documents and videos. Within months, Manning was behind bars, accused of using his computer skills to commit what the government called treason. From Oklahoma to Iraq . It was a far cry from his beginnings. Hailing from the small Oklahoma town of Crescent, population less than 1,300, he was a gearhead with a love of computer games and a passion for current events, his friends and family told CNN in 2011. After working a series of part-time jobs and, at one point, living out of his car, he joined the Army in 2007. But it was a tough acclimation, his friends later said, in large part because of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. According to friends and his own writings on the Internet, Manning is openly gay. Then, in 2009, Manning deployed to Iraq. He was at Forward Operating Base Hammer in southeast Baghdad, where he worked as an analyst reviewing possible threats to U.S. troops. According to Fein, the prosecutor, within two weeks of his arrival in Iraq, Manning began working with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over what to leak and how to do it. Assange has taken refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning in sex-crimes allegations, charges he claims are a ruse by allies of Washington to arrest him and then extradite him to the United States to face charges. Manning spent hours at work during off-hours downloading documents, Fein said. Manning, the prosecutor said, was well aware of the military's policy about divulging classified material and the repercussions of doing it. The soldier had even taught classes about protecting the material, Fein said. ""Manning had no allegiance to the United States,"" Fein told the court last week, adding that he was ""not a whistle-blower; he was a traitor."" But Manning's attorney offered another picture, one in which the war deeply affected his client. It began, his attorney told the court, after an attack on a convoy with his comrades. A roadside bomb exploded beneath a car full of civilians that had pulled aside to let the military vehicles pass. Although members of his 305th Military Intelligence Battalion were not hurt, Coombs said, at least one civilian was killed. That changed Manning's outlook on the war, his lawyer said. He ""struggled."" He was further disturbed by the ""Collateral Murder"" video, the attorney said. ""Did they all deserve to die? That is what Pfc. Manning is seeing when he watches this,"" Coombs told the judge after playing the video in court. It was for those reasons, according to Coombs, that Manning then started selecting information to reveal, believing that it would be better if it were public. Coombs said his client was selective in the information he diverted from a controlled-access computer system where he worked as an ""all source"" intelligence analyst. What would you do? Manning came to the attention of authorities in May 2010 after a confidential informant, later identified as ex-hacker Adrian Lamo of Sacramento, California, came forward with a stunning story. It began with a message said to be posted by Manning, using the instant message handle ""bradass87."" ""If you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day 7 days a week for 8+ months, what would you do?"" it read. According to testimony, that was purportedly part of a string of instant messages that a person sent to Lamo, who was convicted in 2004 for hacking The New York Times, Microsoft and Lexis-Nexis computer systems. Over a period of days beginning on May 22, 2010, Lamo testified, he and the man identified as Manning instant-messaged about the release of the documents and videos. Lamo has said he reported Manning to authorities. Army Criminal Investigation Command Special Agent David Shaver has testified that the chat logs that Lamo provided to the Army largely matched chat logs found on Manning's computer in Iraq. Solitary confinement . Manning was arrested in Iraq on May 27, 2010, and then transferred to Kuwait before being returned to the United States two months later. He was formally charged on July 6, 2010, with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Espionage Act. In March 2011, the military revised the alleged violations and filed 22 charges against Manning. He was held for months by the military in solitary confinement, a move that drew sharp criticism from Amnesty International and other human rights groups. It even cost P.J. Crowley his job as State Department spokesman after he said in March 2011 that the conditions of the soldier's detention were ""ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid."" Crowley resigned just days later amid reports that the Obama administration was furious over his suggestion that Manning was being treated badly. President Barack Obama publicly defended the conditions of the soldier's detention, telling reporters that he had been assured by the Pentagon that the conditions were appropriate and met basic standards. Even so, the outcry grew, with academics, medical professionals and others weighing in as Manning's attorney filed motions to move the soldier from the Marine Corps prison at Quantico. After 11 months in solitary confinement, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth. He has since been moved to a jail at Fort Meade. Dueling portraits . During closing statements last week, attorneys on both sides pointed to a picture of a smiling Manning. Each had their own take on the man in the cross-dressing image that was taken in 2010 while he was on leave -- just weeks before his arrest. ""This is a gleeful, grinning Pfc. Manning,"" who had little regard for his allegiance to the United States, Fein told the court. But Coombs told the judge that picture showed a situation in which Manning could ""be himself."" The only question now is what portrait of Manning the judge will offer with a verdict. CNN's Barbara Starr, Larry Shaughnessy, Ashley Fantz and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Bradley Manning, 25, is charged with violations of the Espionage Act .
His case is in the hands of a military judge who will decide his guilt or innocence .
Manning was arrested on May 27, 2010 .
He is accused of releasing upwards of three-quarters of a million classified documents ."
"(CNN) -- Last year he shocked South Africa's Oscar Pistorius to win over 200m at the Paralympics and Sunday Brazil's Alan Oliveira returned to London's Olympic Stadium to prove he is the fastest amputee sprinter in the world. The 20-year-old Oliveira stormed to victory over 100m in 10.57 seconds, shattering his own recently set record for his T43 class. It left him well clear of American Richard Browne, who finished second in a mixed class race, in 10.75 seconds, itself a world record for a single amputee in the T44 class. Britain's Jonnie Peacock, who won 100m gold in his class before his home crowd last year, finished third in a career-best 10.84 seconds. ""I can't express how happy I am,"" Oliveira said. ""Richard Browne and Jonnie are very fast, I know that. I just wanted to run for 10 seconds and that's what I did."" His performance highlighted the final day of three days of competition in the London Anniversary Games, with the last given over to Paralympic classes. The crowds had come in their droves to pack the stadium the first two days, with Usain Bolt and home hero Mo Farah very much the stars of the show and it was no different Sunday. Oliveira's 200m win in 2012 left Pistorius stunned, with accusations flying over the length of the Brazilian's special running blades. Pistorius, who is facing a murder trial in his native South Africa, later apologized and Oliveira's subsequent performances have backed up his breakthrough victory. His final surge in the 100m would have done Bolt proud as he chopped over two tenths of a second off the world best. Fellow Brazilian, blind runner Terezinha Guilhermina, cruised to 200m victory in her class in 24.91 seconds. Guilhermina and Oliveira are set to be the faces of the Paralympic competition in Rio in 2016. Britain's David Weir was a similar standard bearer going into London 2012 and did not disappoint his followers in the anniversary meet, winning a wheelchair mile in three minutes 16.40 seconds.","Alan Oliveira smashes world record in Paralympic Anniversary Games .

"(CNN) -- Picture the glow of medieval squares illuminated by thousands of sparkling lights. Imagine gingerbread-style stalls where artisans offer traditional crafts that threaten to banish gifts of boring neckties and fruitcakes for eternity. Marvel at iPod-toting children falling under the spell of low-tech charms like wooden toys, ice rinks and vintage merry-go-rounds. By ditching the mall and making the journey to one of Europe's fabled Christmas markets, you can exchange chain stores for cozy wooden chalets, Muzak for angelic choirs and consumer frenzy for down-to-earth local holiday cheer. 'Going to market' remains one of the best ways to see these five fetching cities truly evoke a bygone era, with old world traditions that go as far back as the Middle Ages: . 1. Cologne . Germany's reputation for legendary Christmas markets is well deserved -- and this is the granddaddy of them all. With the dramatic backdrop of the famed Cologne cathedral, the Kölner Dom, casting its magnificent shadows on the festive proceedings, the market at the Domplatz is a good place to start. Next, head to the Medieval Christmas Market, where handcrafts and live music compete with a breathtaking live nativity set for your postmodern attention span. When: 21 November until 23 December . What to buy: Räuchermännchen (wooden dolls complete with smoking pipe), nutcrackers, children's toys, and well-priced charity products whose proceeds go to the needy. Food and drink: Wash down aromatic baked apples and roasted almonds with the traditional, cinnamon-infused glühwein. Plus, an eco-friendly, fair trade ethos means that you can conscientiously indulge in organic treats. For the children: At the Alter Markt you'll find a child's winter paradise, complete with a merry-go-round and a puppet theatre. Ice skaters, head to the Heumarkt. Lonely Planet: The world's hottest cool places . 2. Vienna . Come wintertime, Christmas markets in Vienna become as ubiquitous as the city's elaborate Baroque architecture. You'll find the Viennese version of winter wonderland -- at once cosy and elegant -- coming to life in public squares all over town. After stopping by the popular Christkindlmarkt in front of the Rathausplatz, waltz over to the market in front of the lavish Schönbrunn Palace, the former imperial residence. True to Vienna's storied musical heritage, expect plenty of classical concerts fueling the nonstop city-wide party. When: mid-November until Christmas Eve . What to buy: Hand-blown glass, jewelry, candles and handmade baby cribs . Food and drink: Key indulgences include apfel strudel, maroni (chestnuts), bratwurst and lebkuchen (gingerbread). To drink? Glühwein or punsch, natürlich. For the children: Little ones will go starry-eyed at the market in front of Vienna's neo-Gothic Rathaus (town hall), which is decorated as a giant Advent calendar. A hands-on Christmas workshop, pony and carousel rides and a bewitching winter garden also delight. 3. Bruges . The Medieval splendor of this UNESCO World Heritage site, full of serene grace and picturesque canals, only intensifies when December rolls around. Don't skip the awe-inducing Snow & Ice Sculpture Festival, held in a massive thermal tent. Two tips: dress warmly, and plan to do some serious chilling out with a cocktail in the Ice Bar. When: 25 November until 3 January . What to buy: A fantastic array of Belgian chocolates, along with ceramics (think beer steins), and cozy handmade clothing. Food and drink: You're in Belgium: have a beer. Why not try one of the rich ales specially brewed for the holidays? For the children: Keep shopping-weary kids on their toes at the ice skating rink, held on the Market Square. Lonely Planet: Get steamy with the Finnish sauna experience . 4. Strasbourg . In the heart of Alsace, the German-inflected region of France that is said to be home to the first Christmas tree, this gorgeous market is a classic. Since 1570, the Christkindelsmärik has offered serious holiday enchantments, making it the oldest in France. Stroll from Place Broglie to Place Kléber under the glow of thousands of brilliant lights until you arrive at the festival's focal point: the breathtakingly giant Sapin de Noël, or Christmas tree. When: 26 November to 31 December . What to buy: For Christmas decorations (Strasbourg's been peddling them since 1600) head to the Place de la Cathédrale. Enticing Alsatian food specialties can be found in Place des Meuniers. Food and drink: While adults savor vin chaud, kids can sip on warm jus d'orange sweetened with honey. Along with plenty of German-inspired treats, try the bredele (Alsatian butter cookies in toothsome flavors like ginger and anise) and maennele, or little brioche men. For the children: Picture a kiddie paradise: puppet shows, visits by Saint Nicholas, spirited games, ice skating, a crèche vivante (living nativity scene) and even an ice garden with an obstacle course. Lonely Planet: Dos and Don'ts of Christmas in New York . 5. Prague . As snow dusts its gothic spires and its fabled Astronomical Clock chimes in the chilly air, Prague's cityscape transforms into a gothic midwinter fairy tale. While Staroměstské náměstí, or Old Town Square, is always one of the most stunning in Europe, during Christmas it's downright ethereal. Set against the evocative skyline, the towering Christmas tree -- imported each year from the Krkonose Mountains in the North -- conjures an enchanting Bohemian vibe. When: 26 November until 8 January . What to buy: Hand-carved puppets and wooden toys, Bohemian crystal, Czech glass and ornate ceramic mugs.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The California man thought he put his past behind him, but then he became victim to an online scam associated more with the mafia than the Internet. He is alleging in a federal lawsuit that three websites are running an extortion racket preying on his history as a one-time registered sex offender. The alleged shakedown is a growing trend in cyberspace that also includes ""ransomware"" -- another extortion scheme that uses fake police and FBI warnings to demand money in exchange for unfreezing data on your computer, experts say. In the case of the California man and nine other plaintiffs, their lawsuit accuses three websites of trying to extort $500 in exchange for removing their names and photographs from sites purporting to list sex offenders, though two of the plaintiffs are no longer listed on a state sex offender registry and another two plaintiffs, both women, have never been arrested or convicted of a sex offense or any crime, their attorney says. One of the women is the wife of the California man, both of whom were interviewed by CNN with their attorney. The couple declined to give their names because none of the plaintiffs is identified in a federal lawsuit filed this month in California. ""I am forever sorry for what I did, and I paid my debt to society,"" the man said of his sex offense conviction in Washington state, a crime that he declined to elaborate on. ""I had been rightfully removed from the Washington (sex offender registry) site, and now I'm on the other site that wants money for removal."" The man and woman, both in their 30s, were married last year, and the new husband was looking forward to finally being removed from the Washington state website 10 years after he was convicted of a sex offense. But just as he was removed from the state government registry in January, a website claiming to list sex offenders posted his name and conviction online -- along with a link to photos of the couple, the couple said. The website charged him $79 just to verify the posting about him -- and wanted $421 more to remove his name, photo and the link to their personal photos. That amounts to extortion, the California couple alleges. ""I didn't pay $421 because I don't want to pay for a business like that, and the potential for them to list me again on their site and another site seems all too likely,"" the man said. Added his wife: ""I am thrilled to be married to him, and it seems to me that these guys are literally banking on shame, and it angers me deeply that they are presuming that I would be ashamed of my husband, which I am not."" The lawsuit lists four individuals and 10 other unidentified persons as owning or operating three websites that allegedly function as an extortion scam in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The plaintiffs also cite California's ""right of publicity"" law, which ""says you can't use anybody's name or photograph to help them sell something or solicit something without prior consent,"" said plaintiff attorney Janice Bellucci of Santa Maria, California. ""They're acting in concert and they are extorting money from people,"" Bellucci said of the three websites. The three websites didn't respond to CNN requests for comment. The four defendants didn't return calls or could not be reached for comment. The defendants are Brent Oesterblad of Paradise Valley, Arizona; his brother David of Tempe, Arizona; Chuck Rodrick II of Desert Hills, Arizona, who also goes by Charles David Gilson; and Traci Heisig, also of Desert Hills, Arizona, according to the lawsuit and Bellucci. The lawsuit alleges those individuals own or work for the websites SORarchives, Offendex and Online Detective. Internet security expert Vincent Weafer, senior vice president of McAfee Labs in Santa Clara, California, said online extortion typically occurs when users click on a deceptive link in an e-mail -- and then suddenly a message pops up claiming to be a warning that the user has visited an illegal or illicit site. The computer then locks up, and the warning seeks money ranging from $10 to a few hundred dollars in exchange for unlocking the computer or data, Weafer said. In early 2010, McAfee Labs saw 5,000 cases of ransomware each quarter, but now it has grown to 200,000 cases per quarter, Weafer said. ""It follows e-mail and social networks. That's a collective trend we're seeing,"" he said. Ransomware has grown because it uses an efficient, anonymous payment service. The scam began in Russia and later the former Soviet republics in Eastern Europe. ""By and large you have organized crime groups that took to this early,"" Weafer said. The ransom demand is purposefully kept to a few hundred dollars, he said. ""Obviously, if I ask you for $10,000, you're not going to pay the money,"" Weafer said. ""So the small amount is simply to make it attractive to you to pay it and make it go away."" Online security experts are concerned whether the extortionists will make good on their promise -- or even find a way to return to a computer and seek more money. ""Will they free the machine after you pay?"" says a McAfee Threats Report for the fourth quarter of 2012. ""There are no guarantees, and anonymous payment systems make it basically impossible to track their movements."" The California husband sent an e-mail to a person who operates SORarchives, who responded under a pseudonym with a Gmail address, the husband said. The husband demanded his name erased from the site. He refused to pay the additional $421 for removal. ""They became fairly belligerent in their response and insulting,"" the California man said about the e-mail response. ""There was some profanity in there too, which they graciously asterisked out."" The federal lawsuit represents a legal initiative on behalf of the California Reform Sex Offender Laws organization, a nonprofit that says public sex offender registries and residency restriction laws don't protect children and instead dehumanize individuals and their families. Saying every sex offense should be judged on its own merits, the group asserts public money would be better spent on prevention, healing and rehabilitation. Bellucci is president of the California group. The California couple are members of the group, as is the other California plaintiff, a man in his 60s. He is a registered sex offender and was convicted in 1979 in California for a sex offense, the lawsuit said. The other plaintiffs live in Washington, Kentucky, Tennessee and Oregon. In a telephone interview with CNN, the California man in his 60s said he has new fears about his safety with the additional publicity from the three websites posting his name and photograph. In the past, he has been attacked because of his registry on the California government's sex offender website. His daughter was harassed out of school because of his crime, he said. ""It misrepresents who I am, and that opens me up for potential retaliation for vigilante violence, which I've already experienced now twice,"" the man said of the three websites. He discovered his name on the three sites when a friend searched his name on the Internet and found it listed on the three websites, he said. After paying the websites $79 for an initial inquiry into the matter, he refused to pay the additional $421 the sites are seeking to remove his name and photograph, he said. ""It's a witch hunt,"" he added. ""It's a way to make money off the backs of those who have this horrible tag of being a sex offender, of which people don't have a correct view of what that really means. They have a one-size-fits-all and ... extreme view that sex offenders are damaged humans who will always re-offend. ""That's not the case,"" he said. The federal government website http://www.onguardonline.gov/ offers guidance and contact information in case you find yourself dealing with cybercrime.","Extortion on the Internet is a growing trend, expert says .

"(CNN) -- Billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has reiterated his support for giving women the right to drive in Saudi Arabia, announcing via Twitter that it would help the economy and reduce the number of foreign workers there. ""The question of women driving will result in being able to dispense with at least 500,000 (foreign) drivers, in addition to the social and economic benefits,"" he tweeted Sunday. In the deeply conservative kingdom, women are prohibited from driving, and many must rely on foreign drivers for transportation. Women's rights activist Wajeha Al-Huwaider said Monday that she was glad to hear bin Talal's comments, but she didn't think it would amount to much. ""We got used to him saying the right things but nothing happens,"" she said. ""I think he only makes headlines, but then nothing happens."" Al-Huwaider said that while she found it interesting that bin Talal put the issue in terms of how much it was costing the country, she has ""stopped following any news reports about women driving"" until she hears it addressed by Abdullah. Saudi Arabia is home to around 9 million foreign workers. In recent weeks, thousands of them have been deported in a crackdown by authorities against illegal immigrants. Last week, Saudi King Abdullah granted foreigners working there illegally a three-month grace period in order to legalize their status. Bin Talal, one of the richest men in the world, is the nephew of Abdullah and is considered by some to be a champion of women's rights and empowerment. Last year, his wife, Princess Ameerah al-Taweel, made headlines on the same issue when she spoke out, saying driving laws there should be reformed. ""I think it's a very easy decision,"" she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last September. ""And it is for the government. A lot of people are saying this is a social issue. ... Education was a social issue. And a lot of people in Saudi Arabia were against women getting educated. Yet the decision was made."" There are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia. However, religious edicts are often interpreted as prohibiting female drivers. Such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts, obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian. In 2011, a group called Women2Drive began a campaign demanding that women be given the right to drive in Saudi Arabia. The movement was sparked by the arrest that year of Manal al-Sharif, a Saudi technology consultant and mother who was detained for nine days for driving her own car. Many of her supporters posted videos and pictures of themselves online driving in various Saudi cities.","Alwaleed bin Talal says move would help the economy, reduce the number of foreign workers .

"(CNN) -- Most kids can freely snack at recess, but a growing number of American children have food allergies that can lead to serious reactions if the wrong ingredient gets into their mouths. Ammaria Johnson, 7, of Virginia, died January 2 of cardiac arrest and anaphylaxis, according to a statement from Chesterfield County police. The girl had received a peanut from another child unaware of Ammaria's allergy, police said. Ammaria ate the peanut on the playground, and then approached a teacher, who took her to the school clinic. School personnel, responding police officers and firefighters were unable to save her life, and she was declared dead at Chippenham Hospital. Detectives determined that no crime or criminal negligence occurred as a result of the actions of school personnel, Ammaria's mother or the child who gave Ammaria the peanut, police said. There is no cure for food allergies, and a person can develop them at any age. The only treatments available are antihistamines for mild reactions and injected epinephrine for anaphylaxis -- severe, life-threatening reactions in which the airway closes and the person is unable to breathe. To make matters worse, food allergies are on the rise, although no one knows why. The number of kids with food allergies increased 18% from 1997 to 2007, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year, researchers found that 8% of children under age 18 in the United States have at least one food allergy. CNN received more than 1,000 comments from readers responding to the initial report of Ammaria's death, many of which questioned the responsibility of the school. Some readers said portable epinephrine injectors should be on hand at all schools and child-care institutions. ""And what if a child has their FIRST reaction at a school (i.e., they didn't know they were allergic)? It would be their LAST reaction if the school is not properly equipped to handle it,"" commenter Boater39 wrote. Most school districts have some sort of written policy on food policy management, said Maria Acebal, chief executive officer of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network. Normally, epinephrine prescribed to individual students is kept at school. ""All the school policies I'm aware of require the parent to turn in the medication and to have the school keep it readily on hand,"" she said. And some states have schools that allow students, with appropriate consent, to carry their prescribed medication on them (Acebal's organization keeps this list of states and their policies). Some states, but not the majority, allow schools to have a stock of epinephrine -- not specifically prescribed to anyone -- to give in an emergency to any student who is suffering from an anaphylactic reaction. They may also permit the training of teachers and other staff in the use of epinephrine injectors. Lawmakers are paying attention to the issue. Legislation introduced to the House and Senate toward the end of 2011, the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act, encourages states to require schools to have a stock of epinephrine that can be used for any student who is having an allergic reaction. By some estimates, 25% of allergic reactions that occur in school involve children not known to have had an allergy before, Acebal said. And it's a myth that a person's first allergic reaction won't be a serious one, doctors say. There's no way to know how severely a child will react to any given food to which he or she has a known allergy; any exposure may result in reactions ranging from nothing to a few hives to an inability to breathe. ""The more staff at a school that are trained on food allergy safety, the safer the environment for kids with food allergies,"" Acebal said. Even if you think your child is having an allergic reaction to a food for the first time, it's likely that he or she has been exposed before, in utero, or through contact, or when it has been an ingredient in other foods. Once sensitization occurs, allergy can ensue, says Dr. Clifford Bassett, fellow of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology and an allergist based in New York. Acebal's oldest daughter had a reaction to peanuts the first time she ate them, when she was less than 2 years old. Two injections of epinephrine saved her life. It is possible to develop an allergy at any age; to some extent, it is unpredictable. But there are certain risk factors: a strong evidence of family history, seasonal and indoor allergies, eczema and asthma. A child with one or more of those should be evaluated for food allergies by a board-certified allergist, said Bassett, also a fellow of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. An allergy test can help identify which foods may put a child at risk of anaphylaxis and other reactions. Tiny doses of allergen are placed under the skin, and those that produce a small bump are the likely problem foods. Unfortunately, this test does not predict how severe a reaction to eating that food would be. Education is key to managing food allergies, Bassett said. Knowing what foods to avoid, learning how to read ingredient labels on food products and taking the initiative to ask about problem foods when eating outside the home are all essential. ""Preparedness is part of the overall goal,"" he said. Every child at risk of food-allergic reactions should have an allergy action plan on file with the school that is signed by a doctor, and an epinephrine injector available at school, Bassett said. The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network has an emergency action plan online you can adapt to your needs for school and other child-care purposes. A person who is experiencing anaphylaxis needs to receive epinephrine immediately; rapid decline and death can occur within 30 to 60 minutes, according to the National Institutes of Health. Repeat doses may be necessary, which is why doctors recommend having two epinephrine auto-injectors on hand in case of emergency. During a reaction, the offending food or substance should be removed from the mouth or skin immediately, and the auto-injector should be injected into the thigh muscle. Call 9-1-1 or if already in a hospital, summon a resuscitation team, the National Institutes of Health says. Some CNN readers called for better health support in schools: . kinderlove: Every school nurse should have an [epinephrine auto-injector]. ajkf : Every school should have a nurse. The National Association of School Nurses agrees on both points. About 75% of schools in the country have access to a school nurse, and about 25% do not have any access to a school nurse. Between 40% and 50% have a full-time nurse. There's not really a shortage of school nurses; there's a shortage of funded positions, said Linda Davis-Allbritt, president of the organization. ""Children need to have a school nurse so that their health conditions can be well-managed,"" she said. ""Healthy kids do learn better."" It's rare, but it has happened that when there is a clear emergency, a school nurse would use an epinephrine injection that was prescribed for another student, she said. This action would be controversial, however -- one problem is that the other student could have had a reaction at the same time or shortly thereafter, and their medication would have been used. ""The cost of epinephrine is so much less than the value of a child's life,"" Davis-Allbritt said. ""It would make a lot of sense to have epinephrine available, and have a school nurse in the building every day, and have people besides the school nurse who are trained in case there is an emergency.""","A first-grader in Virginia died of an allergic reaction January 2 .

"(CNN) -- A court denied parole for a jailed member of Russian punk rock band Pussy Riot on Friday, state media reported. The Supreme Court of the Mordovia region upheld an earlier decision to deny Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's parole, the official RIA Novosti news agency said. Tolokonnikova was given a 2-year sentence for hooliganism after a trial in August that was criticized by international rights groups. She is one of three women tried last year for performing a song critical of then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in an Orthodox cathedral. Video footage of their so-called ""punk prayer"" was posted online. State-run court news agency Rapsi cited an attorney as saying Tolokonnikova would not appeal the court's ruling on parole. Fellow defendant Maria Alyokhina, who was also sentenced to two years in prison, was denied bail in May. She planned to appeal the ruling. Yekaterina Samutsevich, a third member of the band, was sentenced at the same time as the two, but was freed from prison in October after her defense presented new evidence.

"Piermont, New York (CNN) -- Autopsy results were released on Monday for a bride-to-be and best man who were killed in a boating accident last weekend on the Hudson River. Lindsey Stewart died ""as a result of drowning and severe head injuries"" and Mark Lennon died ""as a result of drowning"" and ""suffered only minor bodily injuries,"" according to a press release from the Rockland County Medical Examiner's office. Lennon and Stewart disappeared late Friday when a 21-foot Stingray power boat they were passengers on slammed into one of three construction barges strapped together near the Tappan Zee Bridge, 25 miles north of Manhattan. Lennon was to be the best man in Stewart's wedding to Brian Bond on August 10. Both deaths are being certified as ""vehicular homicide,"" according to the release. Post mortem toxicology tests for drugs and alcohol are pending and expected to take several weeks for completion, the release says. Stewart and Lennon were thrown from the boat. Stewart's body was recovered Saturday. But the search for Lennon continued until Sunday morning, when a Jet Skier called police to report a body in the river. ""We're looking into every single thing,"" Rockland County, New York, Sheriff Louis Falco said. ""What we're going to do is bring in an accident reconstruction team."" It was supposed to be a short boat ride up the Hudson River from the village of Piermont in Rockland County to Tarrytown . The couple had just dined at a restaurant with friends when Stewart and Bond boarded the power boat, along with three friends. Potential alcohol use and poor lighting are key points of interest as authorities look into the deadly crash. The barge the power boat crashed into had been anchored in the river since April, according to Robert Van Cura, undersheriff of the Rockland County Sheriff's Office. ""The barge had some lights on it; whether or not it was properly lighted is part of the investigation,"" Van Cura said. ""On a clear, moonlit night, with the bridge lights on, you can see pretty well,"" said Tom Sobolik in a telephone interview from aboard his sailboat near the accident site. The moon was last full on Monday. But Craig and Celeste Kmiecik said they were boating in the area Friday night, and it was dark. ""There was a moon last night, but you really can't see anything,"" said Craig Kmiecik. ""The barge was not lit up,"" said Celeste Kmiecik. ""We saw that last night coming back to the marina."" Another area resident, Anthony Fowler, said having barges on the waterway is dangerous. ""If you put an immovable object that's dark in the path of recreational boaters, you have a recipe for disaster."" Meanwhile, boat operator Jojo K. John, 35, has been arrested. ""We have probable cause to believe that he operated the boat while intoxicated,"" Van Cura said. John was arraigned at an area hospital on one count of first-degree vehicular manslaughter and three counts of second-degree vehicular assault. More charges are possible, Van Cura said. John, along with the others who were not thrown from the boat, suffered head injuries. Bond, the groom, was hospitalized at Westchester Medical Center, said Stewart's stepfather Walter Kosik, who visited him Saturday. ""He was in no condition to talk."" A spokesman for the medical center said Bond was in fair condition, with serious head injuries. He was the one who called 911 from the boat, reporting the accident. For the families, the tragedy was magnified by the pending nuptials. ""She's supposed to be married two weeks from today,"" said Carol Stewart about her daughter. ""It just can't end like this."" CNN's Chris Welch, Alan Duke, Rande Iaboni, and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Autopsy say bride-to-be drowned, had severe head injuries; best man drowned .

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Ma Soe Soe Kyi's skeletal frame is visible above her blanket; she is too weak to keep her eyes open. Her husband waves away the flies and looks on helplessly. Kyi is HIV positive and finally getting help and medication from a private HIV clinic in Yangon, Myanmar. There are 60 patients here -- the oldest is 70 years old, the youngest just three months. Ko Yar Zar is one of the founders of the clinic and tells CNN they used to have to move the operation from house to house and stay secret for fear of being shut down by the brutal military junta. ""Without this clinic, these people would die,"" he says. The clinic was started by pro-democracy leader Aung San Syi Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy. It relies heavily on donations from private enterprises, individuals and AZG, the Dutch arm of Doctors without borders. Ma Aye Mi San is HIV positive and five months pregnant. Infected by her husband, her parents forced them apart when they found out. She has since reconciled with him, saying he is suffering too. ""After I heard I have HIV, I wanted to die,"" she says. ""I felt it was hopeless, I never knew anyone could help me."" HIV is little understood in this country, many of the patients here have nowhere else to go after being ostracized by their families. Countless others, according to Zar, never admit to carrying the disease for that reason, making an accurate assessment of the scale of the problem in Myanmar very difficult. The clinic holds seminars to try and educate the public about HIV. Zar says there is shame attached to buying condoms, so most people don't bother. Only recently have authorities in Myanmar admitted to an HIV/AIDS problem in the country. At a seminar jointly held with UNAIDS, the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, officials from the newly installed civilian government agreed on a five year plan to reduce stigma and spread of the disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 240,000 people were HIV positive in Myanmar in 2009 -- from an estimated 3.5 million across South East Asia. Dealing with HIV in Myanmar is exacerbated by a weak health system chronically under-funded for decades. Spending on health in this country is among the lowest in the world -- just $23 spent per capita, according to the World Health Organization. That compares to $345 per capita in neighboring Thailand. Local residents say decent healthcare is reserved for the rich and the civilian hospitals lack basic facilities and equipment. The health situation is even more dire in rural areas and the tense border areas -- which has suffered from years of conflict between government forces and Karen insurgents.","Only recently have authorities in Myanmar admitted to an HIV/AIDS problem in the country .

"(CNN) -- Last week, my op-ed in favor of cannabis legalization ran on CNN.com. This week marks three years since I first wrote that marijuana should be legal. I'm amazed at how the debate has changed in just a few years. I was inundated with messages from readers, and was humbled by some of them. Here's one from a Southern Baptist church pastor: ""I have seen firsthand the heartache caused by America's prohibition against marijuana. I have visited young men in prison, who I knew in my heart should not be there ... It is time for us to speak out and tell the truth about marijuana ... ""But so many are afraid to speak out because they fear being labeled 'pro-drugs'... I pray daily that God will end this dreadful 'war.'"" The overwhelmingly positive comments posted on CNN.com, especially from those who don't use marijuana, show that more mainstream Americans are willing to voice their pro-legalization opinions. Informed adults are challenging old dogmas, and they worry less about the folly of ""Reefer Madness"" than refined sugar's role in shortening their children's lives. Given the thousands of thoughtful comments in the past week, I'd like to address several of the most important themes readers have discussed: . Damon00 writes: ""A couple of years ago, comments for articles like this were much more negative. People are learning."" Agreed. I believe that the coming of the information age has played a major role in the widely recognized shift in public opinion on legalization. Today's readers are increasingly able to judge facts for themselves by consulting readily available and well-referenced scientific sources. Vertical1 is in favor of ""decriminalizing [pot] and taxing it."" There is often confusion between the terms decriminalization and legalization, though the distinction is critical. Full legalization would empower federal, state and local governments to regulate and tax the cannabis trade. Regulation facilitates control and safety, and government debt can be reduced with taxes raised from marijuana sales. But if we merely decriminalize marijuana, then it continues to be at least nominally illegal. Possession could get you the equivalent of a parking ticket, and those involved in the drug trade might still receive more severe punishment. Not only would this burden law enforcement, but the cannabis economy would remain unregulated and untaxed. Opinion: Marijuana use is too risky a choice . Anon Ymous, who declares himself to be ""pro-legalization, but anti-use,"" writes: ""My life experiences growing up taught me that my friends who smoked pot in grade school, high school and/or college suffered for it."" Make no mistake: marijuana is bad for kids, although pot's potential harm to children is rather more subtle than that of alcohol, which can cause life-threatening physical addiction or fatal poisoning. Studies suggest that repeated marijuana use in adolescents can cause cognitive impairment and chronically low motivation, setting teens on a path of underachievement. But if cannabis is legalized, the tax revenues it brings in can be used to fund better drug education in schools. We must start teaching our children early, highlighting the nuanced but significant risks to underage users and avoiding the typical hyperbole that teens know they can safely ignore. Even with the legalization of marijuana, anyone over 21 should be prosecuted for providing cannabis to anyone under 21. And remember: Drug dealers don't check IDs, but liquor store cashiers do. Given that drug dealers aren't going away, who would you rather have as the retailer of marijuana? DedTV, who is also explicitly pro-legalization, asserts: ""Pot CAN cause hallucinations."" When it comes to marijuana's role in psychiatric disorders, the medical literature and my clinical experience are ambiguous. There's a kind of chicken and egg problem with scientific studies, and they often contradict one another. Cannabis use does correlate with mental illness, but so does poor hygiene. Some users experience transient, mild paranoia when ingesting pot, which generally leads them to simply stop using it. Many of my patients with anxiety and depression have found that frequent use of cannabis makes their condition worse. A few report that it helps them, at least subjectively. Regardless, alcohol is a much stronger depressant than pot. As for thought disorders like schizophrenia, evidence suggests that a very large dose of pot can make a healthy person briefly lose touch with reality, and even modest doses may trigger a more serious psychotic episode in some people who are already ill or likely to become ill. While infrequent among pot users, this is of little consolation if you are the unlucky person for whom cannabis is a match to the fuel of underlying mental illness. On the other hand, it hardly warrants universal pot prohibition any more than the existence of peanut allergies would justify a ban on legumes. Postmasteratfingers asks: ""Is there any evidence regarding the effect on driving while stoned from pot?"" Studies have shown that moderate to severe intoxication with marijuana does indeed increase a driver's accident risk. But look deeper and you'll find that this risk is similar to that of drivers with a blood alcohol level of 0.05%, which happens to be well below the federally mandated legal limit of 0.08%. So once again, pot may not be good, but alcohol is worse. Stephen Lang requests: ""Please don't call it 'weed.' It has lots of uses."" Baby boomers call it ""pot,"" and their kids call it ""weed."" The most common and controversial term is derived from the Spanish vernacular ""marihuana."" Until the 1930s, English speakers preferred the scientifically accurate name ""cannabis."" But those Americans who sought to ban the drug in the 1930s favored the previously little known and foreign-sounding term ""marijuana,"" which might and apparently did stir racial passions among whites. Cohara1103 asserts: ""The main reason it should be legal is... as a 38-year- old white man in a white collar job I will never be stopped, questioned or arrested for marijuana possession EVER!"" After 75 years, haven't our laws against marijuana shed their racist past? Apparently not. Although African-Americans are 25% more likely to use marijuana than white Americans, they are 300% more likely to be arrested for it. A criminal record greatly limits one's opportunities for success in life. The racial divide widens, and racial tensions grow. This, dear readers, is the enduring legacy of pot prohibition. And finally, Roland Gyallay-Pap comments that ""cannabis [is] the correct term for marijuana."" I'm afraid we may be stuck with the contentious word ""marijuana,"" but it provides a useful reminder of one way in which American society was long ago manipulated into the prohibition of a plant that caused a mild euphoria in most people who tried it and a severe paranoia in many who didn't.

"Freetown, Sierra Leone (CNN) -- Sierra Leone and Liberia have some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, with 15-24 year olds accounting for 40% of such deaths) and two years ago, agencies IPPF and FORWARD listened to hundreds of African voices talking about sexual and reproductive health and rights. These weren't the voices of presidents, parliamentarians, politicians, advocates, or activists discussing laws, principles, precepts and policy. They were the voices of young teenage girls in Liberia and Sierra Leone, speaking directly about their experiences, in a project called ""Girls at Risk."" Though not exclusively so, the prime ""risk"" in question was teenage pregnancy: the risk of becoming pregnant; the risks associated with unsafe abortion; and those associated with poor maternal health provision. I was involved as an analyst: reviewing the responses with a view to answering three very straightforward questions. First, why are teenage girls from poor backgrounds so at risk of teenage pregnancy? Secondly, what is the impact of teenage pregnancy and early motherhood on these girls lives? Thirdly, what do girls say about the availability of appropriate services and information? The depth and extent of detail which emerged from what these hundreds of girls said was overwhelming. See also: High-profile teen pregnancies in spotlight . What was most striking was how attitudes and actions which we would consider extreme were related as commonplace occurrences. I talk of rape, incest, abuse and gender-based violence; of girls routinely pressured by parents into marriage, multiple relationships with ""sugar daddy"" partners, or sex work to secure the basics of survival; of the immense physical and psychological trauma caused by years of conflict and the use of rape as a weapon of war; of unsafe abortion resulting in sickness or death; of economic independence denied through forced removal from education . It is a familiar litany: one which it's possible to become desensitized to through repetition. But as I looked over the transcripts of the interviews, the words of these girls (so matter-of-factly stated), came as a real jolt. If you want to know what these girls said, verbatim, I'd urge you to look at one of the two ""In Their Own Words"" . Sexual and reproductive health and rights publications are often hard to read or understand. This is elegant in the simplicity of its expression and the clarity of its message. It may seem to you to be the wrong message to be highlighting on International Women's Day, which should be celebratory. On the contrary. International Women's Day this year is about ""Connecting girls, inspiring futures"". See also: Africa's birth rate: 'Why women must be free to choose' ""Girls at Risk"" connected girls: it brought them together to share knowledge and experience and to disseminate their thoughts and opinions and testimony on a world stage. Critically, it subsequently served to inspire futures: the futures of individuals, and the futures of communities. In Liberia, for example, Marcontee Okai was inspired to set up the exquisitely-named ""Girls of Destiny Reading and Etiquette Club"". It answers girls' needs for a space of their own (one not dominated by boys) for learning vocational skills and for continuing their education. Marcontee says, ""Twenty five girls attend the club which is located in the YWCA. I help them improve their reading skills and develop good manners. My plan is to ensure that every young girl in Liberia has a quality education and information about sexual and reproductive health -- but I will need more support to make that happen."" ""The Girls of Destiny Reading and Etiquette Club,"" in microcosm, offers a solution to many of the ills which our analysis of the interviews in the ""Girls at Risk"" project revealed, and meets many of the recommendations which the team subsequently made. The call was for better signposting to sexual and reproductive health services, for girls-only spaces, for health education and promotion programs to counter myths and misinformation, for confidence and self-esteem building initiatives, and for vocational training to foster economic independence. In addition, courses for pregnant teenagers and mothers on baby and childcare, and a concerted drive to reverse policies which prevent pregnant teenagers staying in school, and the foundations for a revolution in teenage girls' lives are in place. What it needs is the will and the support (the support that Marcontee calls for) to make it happen. I have worked in sexual and reproductive health in Africa and around the world for 20 years. I am profoundly optimistic that change is achievable, and the more we make the world aware of what young women are forced to endure in countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone, the more quickly that change will come. Something definitely to be celebrated on International Women's Day.

"(CNN) -- Just a month after reveling in the glory of a national championship, four members of the University of Alabama football team have been arrested after a pair of campus robberies. The accused are all freshmen players for the Crimson Tide, which beat Notre Dame in a resounding 42-14 victory last month to clinch the BCS National Championship. It was the Crimson Tide's third national title in the past four years. Three of the players -- defensive lineman Dennis ""D.J."" Pettway, linebacker Tyler Hayes and running back Brent Calloway -- appeared in 13 games last season. The fourth, defensive back Eddie Williams, was a redshirt who did not play, The Crimson White campus newspaper reported. According to police, Pettway, Hayes and Williams punched and kicked a student shortly after midnight Monday until he was unconscious, CNN affiliate WVTM reported. The student's backpack with an Apple Macbook Pro was stolen, police said. About an hour later, Williams allegedly beat up another student until he, too, lost consciousness and took his wallet, WTVM said. Hayes and Pettway waited in a vehicle, police said. Later that morning, Williams and Calloway used the second victim's debit card to buy snacks from a vending machine, police said. The football program suspended all four players indefinitely. ""The University and football program have strict guidelines regarding issues of this magnitude,"" Alabama head football coach Nick Saban said. ""This behavior is unacceptable for any student-athlete at the University of Alabama and not representative of our football program."" Police charged Williams, Pettway and Hayes with robbery, a university spokeswoman said. Williams was also charged with using a debit card fraudulently, as was Calloway, the spokeswoman said.

"(CNN) -- A sweaty, wild-eyed man in a stained undershirt hunches over his computer in a shadowy basement. He's broken into your Facebook account and is reading your posts as his dirty, cracked fingernails paw at the keyboard. Rage (jealousy? hate?) builds as he flips through your photos and scrolls through your list of friends. He rocks back and forth, growing more agitated as the pages flash past. Then he consults a map of your city and heads to his car ... So why ... oh, why ... did you include so much personal information -- and your address -- in your profile? If that all sounds like the stuff of a digital-era horror movie, you're not far off. ""Take This Lollipop"" is an interactive short video that's been making its way around the Web as Halloween approaches. Visitors to the site are first presented with an image of a lollipop with a razor blade in it -- don't take candy from strangers, kids -- and asked to grant access to their Facebook account. Don't worry: The application claims it uses your data only once, then deletes it. But the creepy results just might make you think twice about who else gets access to your online information. The video uses the developer tool Facebook Connect and features actor Bill Oberst Jr. (whose credits range from ""The Secret Life of Bees"" to the inexplicably Oscarless ""Nude Nuns With Big Guns"") as the aforementioned grungy nutjob. As he stares at his computer, it's actual photos and other information from your page that he's scrolling through. (Note to parents: If you're tagged in pictures of your kids, be ready for those to pop up, too. It ups the ante on creepiness exponentially). In the weeks since the video went live, viewers have begun sharing it with friends and asking them to video-record themselves while watching it. (This one from YouTube has more than 18,000 views, not to mention a vaguely ""Blair Witch Project"" vibe.) Creator Jason Zada, a commercial and viral marketing director who was the brains behind the viral ""Elf Yourself"" online campaign for OfficeMax, told Porter Gale of Ad Age that he'd been kicking around Halloween ideas and ""wanted to do something that messed with people."" He said the clip is definitely meant to spur thought about how much information we share online. ""Our privacy was dead a while back and will never be the same,"" he said.

The piece is scary because a person is violating your privacy, not because it's bloody or there's anything jumping out."" As of Thursday morning, nearly 2 million people had ""liked"" the page. How many of them are at Facebook's headquarters remains unclear.

"(CNN) -- A frozen fruit mix commonly used in smoothies is suspected in a hepatitis A outbreak that has affected five Western states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thirty people have been infected with acute hepatitis A, and nine of them have been hospitalized. Infections have been reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, the CDC website said Friday. Eleven of 17 ill people interviewed reported eating Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend, a mix of frozen berries and pomegranate seeds. Company records show that the fruit mix with contaminated ingredients was sent to only Costco stores, said William E. Gaar, an attorney for Townsend Farms. Costco has removed the product from its shelves, he said. The outbreak has been traced to a type of pomegranate seeds from Turkey that are in the Townsend Farms fruit mix, Gaar said. The mix contains pomegranate seeds and other produce from Argentina, Chile and the United States, according to the label. ""There is no indication that cherries and other berries are contaminated,"" Gaar said. State health departments, the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC continue to investigate. The company was notified about the outbreak Thursday by the CDC, which sent investigators to the Townsend Farms processing plant in Fairview, Oregon, Gaar said. Hepatitis A is usually transmitted via contaminated food or water, or by someone who's infected, according to the Mayo Clinic website. Frequent hand-washing is recommended to limit the spread of hepatitis A. The highly contagious infection inflames the liver and limits its ability to function. ""Mild cases of hepatitis A don't require treatment, and most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage,"" the Mayo Clinic website says. Severe cases can lead to liver failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A annually worldwide, according to WHO. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Thirty people have been infected with acute hepatitis A .

"(CNN) -- It's depressing to see what has become of the Republican Party, where immigration is concerned. A political party that, just 30 years ago, stood tall in defense of freedom and embodied the limitless opportunity for which America is famous is now stuck playing defense. We've gone from Ronald Reagan declaring, ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall"" in Berlin to Republican Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota demanding another 700 miles of border fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. At least these two senators are proposing something. The naysayers who have pounded away daily at the Senate immigration bill in the hopes of defeating it have not, for the most part, set forth any credible or reasonable proposals of their own. The best they can do is to block what someone else has proposed. That's their definition of victory. That's the game in the House of Representatives, where the debate is headed now that the Senate has approved the immigration reform bill by a vote of 68 to 32. The ""yes"" votes included 14 from Republicans. Many of them came at a high price -- more than $30 billion in new border enforcement measures, via the Corker-Hoeven amendment. But where are the new ideas about how to provide a legal workforce of laborers who will do jobs that Americans shun? Where was the effort to streamline the legal immigration process so that those who play by the rules aren't punished for doing so? Aside from the four Republican senators in the Gang of Eight -- Marco Rubio, John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake -- most of the senators who voted ""yes"" on the final bill had offered nothing to make it better. Leadership requires more than simply voting the right way. Reagan, who said during the 1980 campaign that he supported giving legal status to illegal immigrants and who in 1986 signed an amnesty bill that legalized more than 3 million people -- would be ashamed of what has become of his party. Today, when it comes to immigration, there is no imagination, boldness or grandeur. Republican leaders could choose to pitch Americans on several big themes -- optimism, hope, renewal, confidence, etc. They could try to convince us that our country's best days are ahead of it, and that immigrants will help lead the way. Instead, Republicans are doing what comes easy: peddling fear and scaring the wits out of everyday Americans. This is not exactly new. In the mid-18th century, Benjamin Franklin tried to scare his fellow Americans into thinking that German immigrants would soon ""be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of us Anglifying them."" Later, it was feared that the Chinese were ""not assimilable"" into society, that the Irish were -- in the words of Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts -- ""diminishing the quality of our citizenship,"" and that the Italians were naturally predisposed to criminal behavior. And of course, no matter who was coming ashore, there were always the perennial fears that newcomers take jobs, consume resources, spread disease, crowd schools and lower the standard of living for everyone else. Remarkably, over the last 230 years, the script has stayed pretty much the same. Only the actors changed. This so-called nation of immigrants has always been afraid of immigrants. I've been listening in to the latest round of fear mongering -- ""Fear 2.0"" -- which is epitomized by the handful of Republican lawmakers, and their allies, who have spent the last few months trying to defeat the Senate bill. You hear it from talk radio, right-wing blogs and conservative columnists. The goal is to convince us that, if Congress passes immigration reform and grants legal status to millions of illegal immigrants, Americans should be afraid of 10 things. -- that those who gain legal status will include, in the words of the union representing immigration agents, child molesters, drunken drivers and gang members; . -- that more immigrants will come illegally in the months to come, because of the promise of legalization; . -- that more immigrants will come legally in the years to come, sponsored by newly legalized family members; . -- that those who get legal status won't learn English or assimilate but instead create a country within a country; . -- that the newly legalized will go on welfare, usurp public benefits and bankrupt the system; . -- that this is a fool's errand for the GOP because the immigrants won't vote for Republicans anyway; . -- that the newly legalized might, upon becoming citizens, actually punish Republicans for years of mistreatment; . -- that the country is changing demographically to the point where whites will soon be in the minority, and a legalization program would only speed up the process; . -- that immigrants will worsen population growth, overcrowd our schools, and lower Americans' standard of living; . -- and, finally, that this will create, as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas claims, a ""de facto affirmative action"" by providing an incentive to employers to hire them over U.S. citizens because they're not covered by Obamacare mandates. This is the Republican message in all its glory. It's based on speculation and half-truths and worst-case scenarios that make the most sense to those who know the least about immigrants. It's not accurate. It's not logical. It's not pretty. And it's not helpful.

"(CNN) -- Rand Paul arrives in South Carolina on Friday for a handful of fundraisers and closed-door meetings with local Republicans, the latest in a series of expeditions to key primary states as he mulls a presidential bid in 2016. In New Hampshire, early signs of the 2016 presidential race . If the Kentucky senator decides to embark on a White House run, a likely prospect according to those around him, his South Carolina foray crystallizes what could be a central challenge as a Republican candidate: assuaging skeptical donors in the party's establishment without rankling the grass-roots activists who helped lift him to national prominence. 2016 Watch: Rand Paul's travel plans very telling . How well he straddles those two worlds could very well determine if the diminutive ophthalmologist can re-shape the party in his own image. ""It's going to be a hard line to walk,"" said Robert Cahaly, a South Carolina Republican consultant. ""But he is bridging some gaps that we haven't seen before from another Republican."" As Paul's advisers began sorting out his political travels earlier this spring, they worked hand-in-hand with the South Carolina Republican Party to set up two very different kinds of fundraisers designed to appeal to two different wings of the party. Paul's first order of business Friday is a $1,500-a-plate luncheon in Greenville, a run-of-the-mill ""high dollar"" event that raises money for the South Carolina GOP and offers a handful of wealthy Republican donors a chance to get close to the potential presidential candidate and chat candidly behind closed doors. Friday's trip is Paul's political debut in the early primary state, and the session with donors is just introductory. Compared to the kind of money thrown around in the heat of a presidential election, the ticket price also happens to be quite modest. But these white tablecloth sessions with old-line donors are sure to become increasingly important to Paul if he wants to prove his viability to Republican Brahmins. With individual contributions capped at $2,600 under federal election law, Paul will need more than just online fundraising and a series of ""money bombs,"" small donor activity that helped his father raise competitive sums during his insurgent campaigns, to compete on a national level for the long haul. ""You can't raise enough libertarian Ron Paul money and hope to win,"" said Trey Grayson, the former Kentucky Secretary of State who lost to Paul in his 2010 Senate primary. ""At $2,600 increments, you have to break into establishment money to win the nomination, even if the field is fractured, because it will eventually consolidate."" Later Friday, Paul heads to the state capital of Columbia for a casual ""low-dollar"" fundraiser with a menu of barbecue and sweet tea at the state farmer's market, a chance to mingle with grass-roots activists who purchased tickets for $40 a pop. Paul's political team also arranged a pair of intimate, off-the-record meetings with activists from the South Carolina ""liberty movement"" who were intensely loyal to his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, during his two underdog presidential bids in 2008 and 2012. It's a small but vocal grass-roots constituency that remains deeply resentful of the very party establishment that Paul will be courting, and raising money for, earlier in the day. Since his unexpected rise to the Senate in 2010, the younger Paul has been viewed with suspicion in certain corners of the libertarian movement, in part because he has taken some more hawkish foreign policy stands than his father, such as supporting sanctions on Iran. He also has revealed a pragmatic streak as his stature, and ambitions, have grown. Paul has cozied up to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a beacon of the Republican establishment who backed Grayson in that 2010 primary, and he endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney last summer when Ron Paul was still, technically, a candidate for the nomination, irking many of his libertarian devotees. Paul's advisers are up-front about the differences between the senator and his father. ""There are some people from the more libertarian side who don't see Rand as libertarian enough, even though he has a more libertarian voting record than any senator in my lifetime,"" said Doug Stafford, one of Paul's political aides. ""He is not a libertarian, he is a libertarian-leaning Republican."" Paul faces blowback after new drone comments . In South Carolina, at least, libertarian activists seem willing to let Paul rub elbows with the establishment if it helps him push the party in their ideological direction. ""Rand has moved the playing field right down to the goal line,"" said Chris Lawton, a self-described ""liberty activist"" from Taylors who backed Ron Paul in the past two cycles. ""He is politically more deft than Ron. He realizes that he has a game to play. He is aligning himself with mainstream, but 95% of his political beliefs are similar to Ron's."" Lawton, though, said he is skipping Paul's tour through South Carolina because his events are raising money for the state Republican Party, an institution that Lawton and other libertarians in the state loudly resent. Much of the anxiety surrounding Paul in South Carolina is coming not from his activist base but from the traditional donor class -- even some with long ties to former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, who supported Paul in 2010 and welcomed him into the Senate's ""Tea Party Caucus"" after his victory. ""Rand Paul is probably a little too out there, maybe, for me,"" said Barry Wynn, a longtime financial backer of DeMint's who said, for now, that he's more intrigued by Floridians Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush in 2016. ""I don't have anything against him. He is just a little more outside of the tradition of the people I would tend to gravitate towards."" Republican donor Peter Brown, a Columbia signage manufacturer who tried, unsuccessfully, to lure DeMint into the 2012 presidential race, was more blunt. ""The biggest thing that will hurt (Paul) with people like me is he's got to distance himself from his dad,"" Brown said. ""I live in the real world, and the real world says you can't ignore certain things, you can't ignore the other countries in the world, and the government is here, and it has a purpose. We got what we got, and we have to make the best of it."" That concern -- that Paul is a pie-in-the-sky ideologue who can't be bothered by the grim realities of governing -- emerged as a common theme in conversations with members of the South Carolina business community. ""Being a slight libertarian myself, I agree with a lot of his issues,"" said Leighton Lord, a well-connected Columbia attorney. ""But I am also a practical business guy. You can't maintain those hard-line libertarian views and be a chief executive. My gut is that Rand Paul is not one of those gets-things-done guys."" Stafford, the Paul adviser, said he's heard similar worries from potential supporters before, going back to the 2010 campaign in Kentucky when Paul would meet with Chamber of Commerce-types in Louisville and Lexington. In later fundraising swings around the country, in tony locales like Silicon Valley and Manhattan, Stafford said Paul has used a personal touch to soothe fretful donors who just don't think he can win. ""The best part about Rand is you put him in the room with them and they become way less skeptical,"" he said. ""He is a smart, reasonable person and I don't know that they are expecting the person that they meet. They will walk out, almost to a man, less skeptical. That's why we go to these things. That's why we do GOP events and not just activist events."" In a state with eight military installations, Paul has the added burden of convincing the South Carolina establishment that he won't push American foreign policy in an isolationist direction that could affect the livelihoods of thousands of veterans and military families. Paul: Helping Syrian rebels a dangerous risk . Paul's national security views are leavened by his fidelity to protecting personal liberties. He fiercely opposes drone strikes and military intervention overseas, and he has condemned the recently revealed NSA surveillance program -- positions that put him at odds with South Carolina's hawkish Sen. Lindsey Graham, a reservist in the state's Air National Guard. ""There are some mainstream Republicans who are concerned that people who come from Paul's side of the party do not stand for strong national defense,"" said Cahaly, the Republican consultant. ""He needs to make clear, especially in South Carolina, which is full of vets and people who support the military, that he is not a threat to them."" Lee Bright, a state senator who endorsed the elder Paul in 2012, argued that Rand Paul's views are ""obviously more mainstream"" than his father's. But even if Paul can't persuade GOP elders to back him in a presidential campaign, he predicted, they might be able to persuade themselves. ""Keep in mind that the establishment always seems to gravitate toward a winner,"" Bright said. ""If he is a front-runner, the establishment will find a way to support him.""","Sen.

"New York (CNN) -- A businessman and former stockbroker pleaded guilty Monday to what prosecutors say was a dramatically conceived plot to scam the producers of the Broadway show ""Rebecca, the Musical."" Mark Hotton, 46, of West Islip, New York, admitted to defrauding the producers of the yet-to-open show in 2011 and 2012 by creating fake foreign investors and businesses, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan. ""With his guilty plea today, the curtain is finally closing on Mark Hotton's elaborately staged fraud,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the release. ""Though his lies and deceits were the stuff of fiction, they caused real harm to his victims, and he now faces real consequences as a result."" Ronald G. Russo, the attorney representing ""Rebecca,"" told CNN Monday that the production was relieved by Hotton's plea. ""The damage he did to us was very substantial,"" Russo said. ""Criminal conduct withstanding, the producers are very optimistic about their ability to bring the musical 'Rebecca' to Broadway next year,"" he said. Hotton also plead guilty Monday to participating in a separate scheme to defraud a Connecticut-based real estate company, prosecutors said. He faces up to 40 years in prison for both cases. He also agreed to forfeit $500,000 and to pay $500,000 in restitution to his victims, according to the plea agreement. A lawyer for Hotton could not be immediately reached for comment Monday. In the ""Rebecca"" scam, Hotton promised the show a $4.5 million investment from four overseas investors in return for $60,000 paid to Hotton and entities that he owned, according to federal prosecutors. The ""Rebecca"" producers were introduced to Hotton through the investment community in February 2012, when they had fallen about $4 million short of their budget, producer Ben Sprecher told CNN in October. The producers signed an agreement with Hotton's TM Consulting Inc. on February 7 that entitled Hotton to a $7,500 fee and a guarantee of 8% of any money he raised in excess of $250,000, the government said. Hotton claimed to have secured the $4.5 million from four investors, identified in an indictment as Paul Abrams of Hawthorne, East Victoria; Roger Thomas of St. Peter Port, Guernsey; Julian Spencer of Crocker Hill, Chichester, Sussex; and Walter Timmons of London. All of them Hotton allegedly created and portrayed himself through e-mail. Sprecher said he had not doubted the legitimacy of the deal because of the phone conversations and e-mail correspondences that he had with supposed investors. Hotton had even introduced him to a woman he said was Paul Abrams' niece, he said. But when producers started pressing Hotton for the money, Hotton told them Paul Abrams had died of malaria, Sprecher said. Bharara said that in an investigation begun in September 2012, officials uncovered that the investors' e-mail accounts and the websites for businesses associated with the investors were all controlled by Hotton. Producers had already spent $6 million on Rebecca and were about to begin rehearsals when they found out the $4.5 million from Hotton was not there, Sprecher said. They are now searching to replace that capital and move forward with the show, which has been indefinitely postponed. Hotton will be sentenced in November.

"Trenton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Many 16-year-olds might covet a smartphone, an Xbox, maybe some expensive new sneakers or even a car. Ronald Hennig just wanted a suit so he could attend a relative's funeral. ""I didn't really own even a shirt and tie or dress shoes,"" he said. ""I was seeing some of my old family members, and it was kind of embarrassing to not have a suit when everyone else would have one."" The teenager, who had been in and out of foster care for much of his childhood, was living in a group home at the time. His caseworker was unable to justify the nonessential expense. But an anonymous benefactor stepped in to help Hennig through a website called One Simple Wish. ""I got custom-fitted for the suit and I was able to go to the funeral,"" said Hennig, now 18. ""I could pay the same respect as everyone else."" One Simple Wish was started by Danielle Gletow to help grant the wishes of children in foster care. Each child's wish is posted online, and anyone can pay to make that wish come true --- from tangible items such as a bicycle, a varsity jacket or school supplies to an experience like music lessons or a trip to the theater. Since 2008, the nonprofit has granted more than 4,000 wishes for children living in 35 states. ""There are thousands of children in the foster-care system who go without those normal childhood experiences that many of us have had,"" said Gletow, 34. ""These kids are separated from their parents. They're separated from their siblings. They really don't have people to ask. ... A lot of them decide that it's not worth wishing anymore because it isn't going to happen."" Since 2006, Gletow and her husband, Joe, have been foster parents to several children, eventually adopting one of them. Over the years, many friends and family members expressed a desire to help other children in the system, short of becoming foster parents themselves. ""(They) would say, 'I really wish there was something I could do, but I don't want to be a foster parent,' "" Gletow said. ""I just felt like, this is my opportunity to create something that makes it possible for all of these children who need something to get connected to all of these wonderful people that are out there, that want to help them."" According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, more than 400,000 children were living in the U.S. foster-care system in 2011. But Gletow fears that, too often, we don't see what these numbers represent. ""These are individual children that have individual wishes and individual personalities and wants and needs and dislikes and likes,"" she said. ""And I wanted to share those with people so that ... they could see that this wasn't about nearly half a million children that are in foster care. This was about this young man who wanted to go to karate lessons with his friends at school."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . The most common wishes on One Simple Wish typically cost $10 to $100, and they generally do not exceed $500. Higher-priced wishes can be granted by pooling the resources of multiple donors. ""The wishes that don't seem like the basic necessity are (often) the ones that are the most important,"" Gletow said. ""Because those are the wishes that are really just a kid being a kid, and asking for something that they want to have fun. ""We want them talking about fun things and happy things. We don't want to constantly remind them of how sad or tragic or challenging their circumstances are. We want to remind them that, 'Yeah, there's a really cool new video game out there, and you can play it and there's nothing wrong with that.' "" On rare occasions, there are wishes that exceed $500, such as flying a family member in to attend a graduation or continuing music lessons. These are granted through fundraising drives on the website. ""Anybody -- anywhere, anytime -- can go on our website, and they can look at hundreds of wishes that are posted on behalf of children in foster care and children in vulnerable family environments,"" Gletow said. ""These small things make an enormous difference in the life of a child who has spent their entire life wondering if anybody cares about them."" All the wishes on One Simple Wish are submitted by approved social service agencies and caseworkers. Once the wishes are reviewed and posted to the website, donors can post funds to make a wish come true. ""It's just like online shopping, but at the end you get to give a gift to a child who will thank you more than you could ever imagine,"" Gletow said. ""When a child's wish is granted, we are reassuring them that their voices are being heard."" Gletow also is constantly searching for ways to maximize a gift's value, calling individuals or companies who might be in a position to donate the wish in-kind or provide an item or service at a discount. ""I'm here to be the mom to all of these kids out there who might not feel like they have one,"" she said. ""If I had an enormous house, I'd invite them all to live here. I can't do that, but I know that what I'm doing is making a difference in their lives."" Gletow's nonprofit is also working in other ways to fill gaps in the foster community. Its office is home to several offshoot projects that have benefited thousands of foster youths and families in New Jersey. The Ohana Project helps foster kids, foster-care workers and families by providing 24/7 access to new baby supplies, bed linens and blankets, pajamas and other items that can ease a child's transition into a new placement or home. The Wish to Work program targets older youth to help give them the skills needed in professional careers. Wish to Work provides job-training seminars, networking events, résumé feedback and other assistance. ""I'm now able to apply to college, and I know that I have a competitive résumé,"" said Hennig, who participated in the program last year. ""I know how to be just as equipped as every other teenager my age. And I've gotten all of the same skills that parents would pass down to their children."" Gletow says this is what keeps her going. ""Our states take children out of their homes and say, 'We can do a better job raising you,' and then they don't,"" she said. ""And we need to all step up as a society and do that. ""It's up to every individual person to say all of our children deserve better. Not just the ones that are born into good circumstances. ... That's what I'm going to do with my life. I want my life to be a life of purpose."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- I recently left the Global Forum on Innovation & Technology Entrepreneurship in South Africa, inspired, empowered and hopeful, but extremely impatient to see radical changes to help women in Africa develop a world-class talent in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and businesses. Throughout the event I saw women who were passionate entrepreneurs. They were all seeking new ways of growing their businesses. The women discussed challenges and barriers to success, and how to take their business to the next level. They wanted to grow their network and create global partnerships. Women hold the key to Africa's development, from agriculture to technology and entrepreneurship. But they still face massive hurdles in many areas of development and they are still financially disadvantaged and lack confidence in starting up businesses in Africa. Mid-career dropout is frequent; cultural and social boundaries also are hurdles women need to overcome every day. Gender inequality is also a major issue for women looking to get loans from banks; often, they are not taken seriously. In most African countries women account for a sizable part of the workforce, but still, there are not many places where women entrepreneurs can go for mentoring and support for their businesses. Read this: 'African women need a hand-up not a hand-out' NGOs and global development organizations have for decades hidden the potential of African women by using them as objects of development and statistics. As Chelsey Rhodes recently wrote, we should not see African women as objects of compassion, microloan applicants or demeaning factory-job seekers. You rarely see an African woman millionaire mentioned in the media, unless she is the daughter of the leader of Angola or an elite Oxford/Harvard graduate. Those women don't have the time or knowledge to mentor the grassroots of talented young women who are coding and developing apps in Dakar, Senegal, and Kibera in Kenya. We need to make changes and start paying attention to these young women entrepreneurs in Africa. Technology presents new opportunities for African women who want to take their rightful place in society. African women are already using information technology to build networks and partnerships. Sophisticated mobile phones owned by women in cities like Lagos are being used to pass all sorts of information from factory to factory and village to village, delivering a message of openness and freedom. Social media such as Twitter and Facebook has also helped them spread their stories. Read this: 10 African tech voices to follow on Twitter . Technology is also helping women shape the agricultural landscape by breaking down traditional social barriers. Women can now get access to information on their land, stocks and even health matters. In Kampala and Senegal, women are using SMS to help plan for a family, with basic information on sex education and birth control being delivered on their cell phone. Mobile money is also helping them to receive and send money safely and confidently. Read this: Fighting cancer with cell phones . And women are also contributing to creating technology. Recently, we have seen a rise of women coders in Senegal, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania and DR Congo. But increasing participation and representation of women across the continent is difficult when in many countries women are held back from full and fair participation in public and technological life. We have to build the pipelines for the next generation of African women leaders, and the only way we can do that is to start finding and creating a good ecosystem for women. With that in mind, Africa Gathering is this week celebrating five years of sharing positive ideas. The event is being held in London on June 21 and 22, and the theme is ""Hands-on technology: Rise of the makers, the dynamic and the disruptive thinkers in Africa."" Over two days, this conference for innovators, investors and those with a passion for our continent, will feature world-class speakers and roundtable sessions to cast a spotlight on change-makers, many of them women. And among other things, the event will demonstrate how African innovators -- especially women -- are taking the lead in developing amazing local technological solutions.

"(CNN) -- The body of the driver of one of two commuter trains that collided head-on in western Switzerland has been found in his crushed cab, Swiss police said Tuesday. Twenty-five of the passengers needed hospital treatment after the crash Monday evening, police in the Vaud canton said in a news release, one fewer than had previously been stated. Nine others were treated on the spot for minor injuries and 11 others were unharmed, police said. The train driver who survived, age 54, was injured and is in hospital, Swiss Federal Railways spokesman Reto Schaerli told CNN. The collision happened just outside the village of Granges-pres-Marnand, about 8 kilometers (5 miles) south of Payerne. Authorities are trying to determine what caused the crash. The latest details were given in a news conference Tuesday by the Vaud police and senior Swiss railways officials. At this early stage, police believe that the train driver who survived was supposed to have waited at the train station in Granges-pres-Marnand until the other train had passed, but did not, Schaerli said. It is not yet clear whether there were any technical or safety failures, he said. Police said the surviving driver had stopped his train at the station to allow passengers to board and disembark. Moments after he set off again, the two trains slammed into each other. The driver had time to apply the emergency brake before the impact, police said. The trains were traveling between Payerne and Lausanne, a city on the shores of Lake Geneva, when they collided. No foreigners were on the trains, according to police. Firefighters used heavy machinery to separate the crumpled trains and access the cab where the 24-year-old driver's body was found early Tuesday, police said. The local government sent its condolences to the driver's family. A Swiss Federal Railways statement said ""this is a very sad day and we regret the loss of one of our colleagues as well as those who were injured."" The line between Lausanne and Payerne will remain closed Tuesday, police said. CNN's Susannah Palk and Stefan Simons contributed to this report.","The body of one of the train drivers has been removed from his crushed cab, police say .

"(CNN) -- Filing nervously into a sports hall in Mosul, northern Iraq, around 20 girls prepared to practice gymnastics. Compared to their male counterparts at Mosul University's Faculty of Sport, their number is small. Another difference is that the gates to the sports hall were locked behind them and an announcement made that the hall was exclusively allocated for women. Liqaa Abdul Muttalib, a rhythmic gymnastics trainer says the facilities are not ideal: ""There are pillars in the hall which limit free movement and rotational flips. This hall was initially designed for physical fitness."" Behind another locked gate Ammar Shihab was coaching the university's recently formed five-a-side female football team. ""Women's participation has shrunk following the 2003 events,"" said Shihab. ""However, this did not prevent women from exercising and participating in sports tournaments. Our women's football team took part in the tournament that took place in Syria in 2010."" On the separation between the two genders in sports Shihab thinks ""it is a right step for both of them at the present time."" It seems that the way society views women in Mosul and much of the surrounding Nineveh province is reflected in the attitude towards women's participation in sports. Some believe that it's inappropriate, like Nihad Mohamed Qais, is a 22-year-old student. ""I don't like women's participation in sports. It is not a civilized phenomenon. Therefore, I will not allow my sister or a female relative to participate in sports or to join an athletic club or faculty,"" he said. ""What makes me reject the idea is what I heard about the presence of boys and girls together, in addition to the presence of male coaches. I also do not like the idea of women wearing sports uniforms."" While the majority of men in Mosul do not agree with women's participation in sports, some women support it. One of them is 20 year old Dhikra. ""I do encourage women's engagement in sports, provided that they do their exercises in the absence of men so that they will feel at ease, at least with regard to wearing the sports uniform,"" she said. ""I believe that religious considerations are the main reason behind the families' objections to their daughters joining faculties of sport."" Khalid Abdul Majeed is Deputy Representative of the Olympic Committee in Nineveh. He also believes that family disapproval and social conditions prevent more women participating in sport, as well as more of them wearing hijab (head scarves) ""We have a female volleyball team which ranks second in Iraq,"" said Majeed. ""However, all the teams are found in Nineveh Plain because of the better security situation in the area as well as the positive social views about female athletes, which is almost free of perceptions of inferiority."" Duaa Sabhan, 22, a talented and enthusiastic athlete, said that wearing the hijab did not prevent her from taking part in sports. ""I do not support the present separation between us and our male colleagues,"" she said. ""There is nothing that prevents me from exercising with them. I don't pay attention to society's views because my sole wish is to learn and improve my athletic skills. My father often encourages me to get rid of the state of social shyness."" When society constitutes a barrier, parents may support their daughters and lead them towards success and allow them to travel and participate in athletic contests. But the case of Sabhan is quite different from that of Riyam Ali who plays on the five-a-side football team. ""My family did not allow me to join the Faculty of Physical Education,"" she said. ""Therefore, at the end of the day, when my lectures finish, I join the team to attend training drills and exercises. Of course my male and female colleagues do not know about my coming here because they do not welcome the idea."" In Iraq religion has its say concerning women's involvement in sport and taking part in contests. ""Women's sport nowadays is a cause for molestation of women, particularly the sports that are covered by media and broadcast to the public,"" said Skeikh Ahmed Ghanim, imam and preacher at the Islamic Awakening Mosque and a member of Iraq's Scholars Association in Nineveh. ""The aim of this is merely to export women to the West. However, women may exercise and do their drills inside confined halls, separately from men, while wearing their legal dresses."" ""The limited role of women in the athletic field in terms of winning medals, good results, flags and participation does not constitute any risk to the country, and female athletes winning medals and cups is not an achievement for the country and does not contribute to its development,"" Sheikh Ghanim added. Religious and social views are almost the same and seem to have contributed to the difficulties many women find in joining in sports in Iraq.","Women in Mosul, northern Iraq, must practice sports behind closed, locked doors .
Many men and women disapprove of women in sport and are against mixed gender training .
Situation is different outside of Mosul where there is a more positive view of women in sport .
Some use wearing of hijab as excuse to say women cannot compete effectively in sports ."
"(CNN) -- It was a fable made famous by football -- now Japan's rising tennis star Kei Nishikori is doing his best to dismiss the long-held sporting notion that size does matter. Of the sports' top 15 players, only two are shorter than 6'0"" -- Nishikori, who stands at 5'10 and Spain's current world No. 5 David Ferrer who is an inch shorter than the Japanese player. The world's top four players - Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal - are all over 6'0, while six of the top 15 are 6'5"" or taller. Height is particularly important in tennis as it makes a player's service harder to return because of the power, height and bounce that can be generated by the server. So the tallest player of all time Ivo Karlovic, who is 6""10', is capable of serving at 251km/hr. The 22-year-old Nishikori relies on a vast array of ground strokes and blistering speed to counteract the power he often faces in opponents that sometimes tower nearly a foot over him. And he is slowly proving this supposed disadvantage can be his primary weapon, as his finest year to date unfolds. In 2012 he became the first Japanese man to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 80 years and the first Japanese player to win his home nation's most prestigious tournament in its 40-year history. His 7-6 3-6 6-0 win over the 6'4"" Milos Raonic earlier in October was also the first time Nishikori had won a trophy since Delray Beach in 2008. With the help of veteran Nick Bollettieri -- the coach Nishikori calls the greatest in the history of the game -- and Dante Bottini, the Japanese star currently sits proudly as the 15th best player in the world. ""I am not the tallest guy on tour so I have to have good legs and good speed and that's my weapon,"" Japan's rising son told CNN's Open Court show, as he reflected on the task of taking on the giant, fast-serving titans of the modern game.. ""It's not easy to play with big servers because, for me, it's hard to hold my serve. It is getting better but still, not easy. Not as easy as tall guys. ""I think I have a good return. I still struggle. I have good speed; I have to cover with my legs. I can do different things than those tall guys. Its not easy but I have to mix the shots."" Technique wins out . The ""size matters"" myth has been ground to dust in other sports in recent years. It was a theory that held steadfast in soccer until countries like world champions Spain, and Germany, moved away from height and physical strength as a cornerstone of their philosophy, turning to a new generation of more diminutive, technically gifted players. The most dominant European club side of recent years has been Spanish giants Barcelona, whose players make up the nucleus of an all-conquering Spain team. Among their ranks is Argentina striker Lionel Messi, considered by many to be one of the finest footballers in history, who stands just 5'6"" tall. As for Bollettieri, who has honed the talents of players like Andre Agassi and Serena Williams at his famous Florida academy, he is in no doubt Nishikori's nimbleness around the court is his main weapon in his battle against more lofty opponents. ""Kei is a shot maker,"" Bollettieri told CNN. ""And when he's on, he can beat anybody in the world. Now remember, Kei is not a big guy. So he has to be very careful to take advantage of the opportunities when he gets them. ""If you're small, it's more difficult, no matter what anybody says. If you look at today, probably the height of the guys is 6'2"", 6'3"", the ladies up at 5'9"", 5'10"", Sharapova 6'3"", Venus 6'2"". ""So you take that as fact and you don't throw in the white towel and say 'I can't do it'. What Kei has, he has mobility, he creates and he has unbelievable hands and feet that you can't purchase. ""So he has to keep adding, keep working on any defensive balls, come to the net a little bit more, and this is what Dante is working on. If he stays status quo, he'll win a lot of matches. ""But to be among the big boys and to break that top 10, which we all feel he will do, he probably will have to add a little bit more transition to his game."" Role model . Nishikori's dramatic progress this season has mirrored that of Formula One driver Komui Kobayashi; both men hoping to act as a catalyst for burgeoning interest in their respective sports. ""Basically, in Japan, they're not giants,"" added Bollettieri. ""You look at some of the good players, they're very strong, good ground strokes,"" he said. ""It gives hope, and you get more people out there playing the game. The more people that play the game increases your chances of having good players, great players, and hopefully some day a champion."" Nishikori's recent victory in the Japan Open, when he became the first Japanese player to claim the title since the competition began in 1972, has only strengthened the belief within his camp that a grand slam title is within reach. The 22-year-old's epic victory over France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Australian Open in January saw him become the first player from Japan to make the last eight in Melbourne since 1932. And with time on his side, the hope is that Nishikori could finally end Japan's long wait for a major champion. ""Of course I want to win grand slams,"" he said. ""I think everyone is the same. But my favourite tournaments are the U.S. Open and the French Open -- those two I like. So hopefully I can win one of the grand slams."" 'Project 45' Nishikori's first ATP Tour title at Delray Beach came at the tender age of 18 when he was still outside the top 240 players in the world. It was Japan's first tournament success since Shuzuo Matsuoka won the Seoul Open in 1992. It also served as justification for his family's decision to send him to Bollettieri's academy as a 13-year-old, even though he spoke not a word of English. ""The first year was tough, because without English I was really shy so I couldn't speak much with friends,"" explained Nishikori. ""But I was enjoying playing tennis all day. I would start playing tennis from 7am until 5pm, so that was fun for me."" His Delray Beach triumph gave rise to what became known as 'Project 45' in Japan. Positively Orwellian in title, it was actually Nishikori's mission to overhaul Matsuoka's career best ranking of 46 -- the highest any Japanese player has ever reached. Nishikori broke through that particular barrier at last year's Shanghai Masters and now has his sights set on the top 10. Should he do that, Nishikori might have to increase his wardrobe of disguises, to avoid being mobbed on home soil. ""In Japan it is a bit crazy. I have to hide -- I have to wear caps, sunglasses, masks. I look weird but sometimes I have to do that. Like when I go shopping everybody starts tailing to me and I can't concentrate to shop!""","Japan's Kei Nishikori has reached a career high ranking of 15 in the men's game .

"(CNN) -- Last month's deadly rail accident in Canada spurred the top U.S. rail agency to toughen safety standards, specifically for the transport of hazardous materials. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad Administration issued an emergency order preventing trains on ""mainline tracks or siding from moving unintentionally."" The agency made the move after an unmanned, runaway 73-car train slammed into the center of the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic in the early morning of July 6. Tank cars full of oil exploded and burned in the heart of the commercial district. The remains of 42 people were recovered, and five people are reported missing. See accident images . The train had been parked in the neighboring Quebec town of Nantes, but it suddenly rolled into motion after the engineer went to a hotel. The incident is under investigation by Canadian authorities. Last month, Canada's Transportation Safety Board determined ""the braking force applied was insufficient to hold"" the runaway train. ""Safety is our top priority,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. ""While we wait for the full investigation to conclude, the department is taking steps today to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the United States."" The directive is ""mandatory"" and the failure of railroads to comply ""will result in enforcement actions."" ""No train or vehicles transporting specified hazardous materials can be left unattended on a mainline track or side track outside a yard or terminal, unless specifically authorized,"" the order said. If a railroad wants authorization to leave a train unattended, it ""must develop and submit to FRA a process for securing unattended trains transporting hazardous materials, including locking the locomotive or otherwise disabling it, and reporting among employees to ensure the correct number of hand brakes are applied."" Employees who are responsible for securing trains and vehicles transporting such specified hazardous material must tell dispatchers specific information: ""the number of hand brakes applied, the tonnage and length of the train or vehicle, the grade and terrain features of the track, any relevant weather conditions, and the type of equipment being secured."" Train dispatchers must record the information they get and ""railroads must implement rules ensuring that any employee involved in securing a train participate in daily job briefings prior to the work being performed."" Also, procedures must be developed ""to ensure a qualified railroad employee inspects all equipment that an emergency responder has been on, under or between before the train can be left unattended."" And, railroads must pass along the order to ""all affected employees."" The rail agency and the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration also issued a safety advisory listing recommendations railroads are expected to follow. ""When PHMSA talks about the transportation of hazardous materials, safety is a prerequisite to movement,"" said PHMSA Administrator Cynthia Quarterman. ""We are taking this action today and we will be looking hard at the current rail operating practices for hazardous materials to ensure the public's safety.""

"(CNN) -- If you're a brown tree snake, those dead rodents that will soon be falling from the sky over Guam's Andersen Air Force Base could be your last meal. That's because the U.S. Department of Agriculture is planning to pack each one with acetaminophen, the generic equivalent of Tylenol, which can kill a snake in 72 hours. The drug-laced mice will be taped to pieces of cardboard, which in turn will be attached to streamers that will be dropped from helicopters over more than 100 acres of the Air Force base on the Pacific island. The bombing campaign is expected to begin this spring, Dan Vice, the USDA assistant operations director on Guam, told the local Pacific News Center. It replicates a smaller-scale test drop tried on Naval Base Guam in 2010, he said. The goal, he said, is eradicating the brown tree snake from the island. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says brown tree snakes have wiped out most of Guam's native populations of forest birds since being accidentally introduced to the island after World War II, probably after they stowed away on a ship or plane from their native range in Australia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The snakes, which can grow up to 8 feet long, also eat small mammals and lizards. The snake is mildly venomous, the FWS says, but it does not pose a danger to most adults, and its bite will not penetrate clothing. Besides its effect on bird populations, the snakes also take an economic toll on Guam by causing numerous power outages each year when they cross from tree into electrical lines, the FWS says. There could be as many as 2 million of the snakes on Guam, where they have no natural predators. About 2,000 mice will be dropped in the newest test, the Pacific Daily News reports. The $1 million program is being funded by the Department of Defense, according to the report. ""No one's ever attempted anything on this scale,"" Vice said of this spring's planned air drop. ""You know to date the largest plot that anyone's been able to get rid of snakes is only a couple of acres. We're talking 110 acres so this is completely novel."" The dead mice will target snakes in a fenced-in area of the base, he said, so officials will be able to determine the effectiveness in that area versus an adjacent area that the snakes could move in and out of. ""We have a site where there's a population of snakes that nobody can get into. It's a controlled population,"" Vice told the Pacific News Center.

"London (CNN) -- Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson and her multimillionaire art collector husband Charles Saatchi took a step toward divorce Wednesday in London -- weeks after images of him grabbing her by the throat made headlines. Neither party was at the High Court to hear the judge grant the ""decree nisi,"" on the grounds of Saatchi's ""unreasonable behavior."" But in a sign of the media interest in the proceedings, more than a dozen journalists were in court for the brief hearing. After six weeks, the couple can apply for a ""decree absolute,"" the legal document that will finalize the divorce, bringing to an end 10 years of marriage. Court documents show that it was Lawson who filed for divorce. No details are given of the financial settlement agreed to between the two, each of whom is wealthy. Tension between the pair hit the tabloids after Saatchi was photographed placing his hand around her neck and twisting her nose as the pair had lunch at a London restaurant. Lawson and her children moved out of their family home as the media storm blew up. Saatchi told the UK's Mail on Sunday newspaper early this month that divorce proceedings were under way. ""I feel that I have clearly been a disappointment to Nigella during the last year or so, and I am disappointed that she was advised to make no public comment to explain that I abhor violence of any kind against women, and have never abused her physically in any way,"" Saatchi wrote in the statement. ""This is heartbreaking for both of us as our love was very deep, but in the last year, we have become estranged and drifted apart."" Lawson, known as the ""queen of food porn,"" has written numerous successful cookbooks and hosted several TV shows in Britain and the United States, including the ABC show ""The Taste."" Saatchi, an art dealer and former media mogul, denied that he attacked Lawson but told a London newspaper that he voluntarily went to police a day after the pictures were published to accept a police warning. According to a UK government website, a caution is issued for minor crimes and is not a criminal conviction.","A ""decree nisi"" is granted for celebrity chef Lawson and art collector Saatchi .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Virginia mental health facility has dropped out of a plan to allow presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. to participate in social group sessions, according to a government court motion issued Friday. Government prosecutors are calling on the federal judge overseeing Hinckley's case to reject a proposal by St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington to allow the man who shot President Ronald Reagan to have longer visits away from the government mental hospital. According to the court filing, St. Elizabeths sent an August 8 letter stating that Colonial Behavioral Health, People's Place facility in Williamsburg, Virginia, had withdrawn from the plan to participate in Hinckley's treatment. The letter has not been made public and prosecutors did not reveal why People's Place had bowed out. Prosecutors called the group sessions a ""core feature"" of the plan to allow Hinckley to spend more time living with his elderly mother in Williamsburg. ""It now appears that the Hospital will need to begin anew in developing a plan for the expansion of (Hinckley's) current conditional release privileges,"" prosecutors wrote in their motion. The government wants the opportunity to have its mental health experts review any new plans St. Elizabeths may develop for Hinckley. U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman did not immediately respond to the government's motion. Hinckley currently spends 10 days a month visiting his widowed mother, who is in her late 80s. In July 2011, St. Elizabeths made a proposal to allow Hinckley two visits of 17 days duration followed by six stays lasting 24 days. After the proposed visits, St. Elizabeths requested the authority to decide whether Hinckley, 57, could be released on ""convalescent leave,"" which would make him a permanent outpatient. Friedman presided over 13 days of testimony in late 2011 and early 2012 to consider the plan and has yet to issue a ruling. The government is opposed to the plan. Government experts testified that Hinckley has failed to make friends in Williamsburg and could become socially isolated. Hinckley's lawyers and St. Elizabeths said his participation in sessions at People's Place would help prevent that. One of the biggest controversies raised during the 13 days of hearings was that Hinckley did not always follow hospital-approved itineraries for how he would spend three hours of unaccompanied time allotted to him twice during each of his visits. \ . Witnesses testified that in July and September of 2011 Hinckley skipped movies he was permitted to attend and then lied about it. In addition, Secret Service agents who were watching Hinckley without his knowledge testified that in July and October last year, Hinckley went to bookstores and looked at shelves of history books, some of which dealt with presidential assassinations. Dr. Raymond Patterson, the former director of forensic psychiatry at St. Elizabeths, testified for the government. He said he interviewed Hinckley and specifically asked him about lying about going to the movies. According to Patterson, Hinckley said the doctor was ""nitpicking."" Patterson and a second government mental health expert said Hinckley should have kept to his itineraries to prove he could be trusted. Hinckley's defense lawyer Barry Levine said the key question is whether Hinckley is dangerous. ""Not once during any one of these releases has Mr. Hinckley done anything dangerous or violent. Not once,"" Levine said during his closing argument in February. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the March 1981 shooting of Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and police officer Thomas Delahanty. Brady was shot in the head and permanently disabled.","The plan called for Hinckley to participate in group sessions in Williamsburg, Virginia .

"(CNN) -- In his first major cycling event since his doping admission, Lance Armstrong says he still anticipates fallout from the scandal that erased his Tour de France victories. But he's ""a big boy"" and can handle it. Armstrong admitted this year for the first time that he doped throughout his cycling career. His admission, after years of defiantly shunning such allegations, was followed by a brief disappearance from the limelight. The disgraced cyclist on Monday attended the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, his first major cycling event since his admission. In an interview with the Des Moines Register, he said the event's attendees have been supportive. Froome: Cycling's doping past won't overshadow Tour triumph . ""I didn't expect a wave of hostility ... so far there's not been any middle fingers,"" he told the paper. ""But it may happen, and I'm prepared for that. That's just the nature of the story, and I understand that."" Armstrong admitted in January that he used an array of performance-enhancing drugs to fuel his seven Tour victories. Fast Facts: Performance-enhancing drugs in sport . They included testosterone, human growth hormone and blood transfusions to excel in the highly competitive world of cycling, he said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. Some cycling fans expressed feelings of betrayal after his admission, which included confessions that he bullied those who tried to bring the allegations to light. Others argued that his cancer survival story inspired millions and his charity, Livestrong, helped those battling the disease. But for many, he said, his doping remains a sensitive topic. ""I think it's a polarizing topic for some people. I'm not ignorant when it comes to that,"" he told the paper. ""I know it was an unfortunate period in our sport. When I say period, I mean 10, 15, 20 years, and unfortunately for me, I came right smack dab in the middle of that period."" However, he told the paper, he was not prepared for the backlash that followed his admission. Readers sue Lance Armstrong for book refund after doping admission . ""The reaction and fallout was more than I expected ... but that's life. I'm a big boy. Again, a polarizing topic that left a lot of people stumped. It wasn't a pretty time. I didn't invent it. I didn't end it. My bad for playing along."" Born in Texas, Armstrong, 41, started professional cycling at a young age. But his sporting career ground to a halt in 1996, when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer at age 25. His 1999 Tour de France win seemed all the more extraordinary after he fought off a disease that had spread to his lungs, abdomen and brain. He went on to get more straight wins until 2005. He then left the sport, only to return four years later and finish third. Armstrong was stripped of his Tour titles and banned from professional sports for life by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. The man who exposed Lance Armstrong's doping lies . His reputation is in tatters, and the cycling victories that made him a legend are now wiped away. He has been asked to repay millions of dollars to a host of organizations, including the French Cycling Federation. However, his biggest concern is his five children and their reaction to his fall from grace. His youngest, ages 2 and 4, are especially vulnerable, he said. ""They're going to grow up into a time where everything is forever. Everything will be on YouTube; everything will be cataloged. So forever, they'll live with it,"" he said. ""That's my job to try and walk the line with them now."" Armstrong continues his ride Tuesday, his final day at the weeklong event.","""I didn't invent it; I didn't end it.

A funeral service for family and friends is scheduled for Thursday in New York, Kobold said. It will be held at The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. Gandolfini, 51, died last week while on a working vacation in Rome. He arrived there with his son, Michael, the day before he died.

"(CNN) -- Prize money at this year's U.S. Open will be increased by over $2 million to a record $25.5 million, organizers announced Wednesday. The increase will see a top prize of $1.9m for both the men's and women's champions, continuing the tradition of gender-equal prizes dating back 40 years. The remaining majority of the payout will be distributed throughout the main draw, with 224 out of 256 singles players guaranteed an increase in prize money of at least 18%. ""We recognize the mounting financial pressures associated with competing on the global professional tennis circuits and especially for those who do not reach the second week of the U.S. Open. ""We believe the additional prize money, as well as how it will be strategically distributed, will help alleviate some of the pressure,"" said Jon Vegosen, U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) President and Chairman of the Board. These record-breaking figures will be supplemented by potential bonuses from the Emirates Airline U.S. Open Series Bonus Challenge. The top three men's and top three women's finishers in the Emirates Airline U.S. Open Series will be awarded an additional bonus prize of up to $1m at the end of the grand slam, provided they earn points in at least two series events. These bonuses have led to the two largest payouts in history, with Roger Federer taking $2.4m in 2007 and Kim Clijsters earning $2.2m in both 2005 and 2010. This leaves the potential overall prize money on offer at $28.1 million. The cash boost comes on the heels of the announcement that the U.S. Open will benefit from a $500m development of the Flushing Meadows area. A new Louis Armstrong Stadium, a new grandstand on unused land at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and a double-deck viewing area for fans to watch players practice will all be constructed over the next 10 years.

"Washington (CNN) -- A major immigration bill that would give millions of people living illegally in America a path to citizenship cleared a key legislative hurdle Tuesday when a strong Senate majority voted to open debate on it. The 82-15 vote, with most Republicans joining the chamber's Democratic majority in support, launched what was expected to be an arduous legislative journey for the 1,076-page measure. Both supporters and opponents expect the bill to pass the Senate despite fierce opposition from conservatives. However, one GOP foe said Tuesday the Republican-controlled House would defeat it in its current form due to the pathway to citizenship. The legislation addresses an emotionally charged issue with huge political stakes for both parties. President Barack Obama and Democrats want to fulfill a promise to Hispanic Americans, the nation's fastest-growing demographic and a key voting bloc, to address the limbo of the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the country. A few hours before Tuesday's vote, Obama tried to build momentum for the proposal at a White House event where he called it a commonsense approach to fix a broken system. 5 things to know about immigration reform . Addressing concerns of the measure's opponents, Obama emphasized it would increase spending on border security and require undocumented immigrants to pursue what could be a 13-year path to eventual citizenship. ""You have to pass background checks, you have to learn English, you have to pay taxes and a penalty and then you have to go to the back of the line behind everybody who has done things the right way and have tried to come here legally,"" Obama said. Latino voters backed Obama over GOP nominee Mitt Romney by a 44-point margin last year, and Republican strategists are concerned about the party's long term viability in national elections if that trend holds. In the Senate, Republicans who forced Tuesday's procedural step that required at least 60 votes to launch debate on the immigration bill joined Democrats to easily surpass that threshold. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warned that some Republicans had no intention of supporting the measure even though they voted to open the formal debate and will propose amendments during the upcoming debate. Opponents led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas accused Democrats of insisting on the pathway to citizenship as part of the bill, knowing House conservatives won't accept it. The goal of Democrats is to secure a popular campaign issue with Hispanic voters for the 2014 mid-term election and 2016 presidential election, he said. Vermont senator revives debate over gay rights in immigration bill . ""I think it's going to pass the U.S. Senate with a substantial margin,"" Cruz said. But ""absent major revisions ... this bill will crash and burn in the House. And it is designed to do so."" Polls show many Americans favor some form of immigration policy overhaul, depending on the details of legislation. The bipartisan proposal before Senate was hammered out this spring by the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" senators -- four Democrats and four Republicans. Some congressional conservatives call opposing the ""Gang of Eight"" plan a matter of principle and say they won't bend. Many consider any measure offering a path to citizenship tantamount to amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. In addition, concerns about whether the bill will tighten security along the nation's porous borders, as asserted by backers of the plan, may make it difficult for conservatives to support it -- especially those up for re-election next year. ""The bill grants permanent legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants, as currently written, without really any guarantee of securing the border. Now, how would that possibly be a good idea?"" asked Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, who voted Tuesday for opening debate. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, a member of the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" who is considered a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, argued that doing nothing amounts to what he called a ""de facto amnesty"" for immigrants currently living illegally in America. House working on its own plan . At the same time, Rubio -- a popular conservative of Hispanic descent -- has made it clear that border security requirements must be toughened if he and other GOP skeptics will support it. He is pushing an amendment that would make Congress, not the executive branch, responsible for deciding if security metrics at the border have been met before other aspects of the reform bill -- including the pathway to citizenship -- are triggered. Because Rubio's support is so critical, other members of the bipartisan group have hinted they likely will back his proposal even though they are reluctant to make major changes to their original compromise. The vote on the Rubio amendment will be one of the most closely watched as floor action unfolds over the next three weeks. Other planned amendments will involve stepped-up security checks of people entering the country, temporary visas for high- and low-skilled workers, and other technical provisions. Obama says no one will get everything . In a rare display of unity, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, union leaders and other interest groups have come out in support of the Senate plan. Advocates for comprehensive reform won the first major legislative victory last month when the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13-5 to approve the ""Gang of Eight"" plan. Democratic leaders hope to have a Senate vote on final passage by the end of June. A bipartisan group has been working on a separate immigration plan in the House, but the effort suffered a setback last week when a key member dropped out of the negotiations. Previous efforts to pass immigration reform fell short last decade even though it was said to be a priority of President George W. Bush.

"(CNN) -- The fairy tale forests of the Gauja Valley in Latvia, the beauty of Saaremaa Island in Estonia and the 170-foot-high Parnidis Dune in Lithuania were waiting for author Patricia Schultz to discover them. The newly independent countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were reeling from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and were not tourist friendly enough to include in her first edition of ""1,000 Places To See Before You Die,"" published in 2003. Also missing were the stunning Adriatic beaches of Budva, Montenegro; the ancient Roman arena of Istria, Croatia; and the pedestrian bridges over the Ljubljanica River in Slovenia. The civil war in Yugoslavia, following on the heels of the fall of the Soviet Union, kept her away. More than 20 years after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the new ""1,000 Places To See Before You Die"" includes the Baltic nations formerly under Soviet control, the nations of the former Yugoslavia and several other countries once considered too dangerous or unfriendly for any but the most hardy travelers. There are also places like Ghana and Greenland that Schultz didn't have time to tackle in the first book. All in all, the second edition includes 200 more entries, 28 additional countries, 200 more pages, 600 color photographs and an interactive iPad app. Now that travel is more accessible and people want to see and do more things they've never experienced before, Schultz has expanded the ""1,000 Places"" concept beyond that ""once-in-a-lifetime"" honeymoon, 25th anniversary or 75th birthday trip. Her hotel recommendations now include smaller, more affordable inns in addition to the most fabulous hotels. The definition of ""1,000 Places"" has expanded to include itineraries or experiences within particular regions. ""There's nothing or no place that doesn't interest me for some rhyme or reason, from natural beauty to man-made beauty, from high-brow to low-brow, from festivals to food to culture to music to design,"" says Schultz, who has traveled professionally for most of her adult life. She estimates she visited 80% of the sites included in the book. ""So much to see, so little time!"" she said. ""One would need to be 200 years old to have seen them all."" (A seasoned travel writer, she knows ""quite confidently"" that Antarctica and other places she hasn't visited do belong in the book.) For the rookie or nervous traveler . For the new or nervous traveler who wants to explore outside his comfort zone, Schultz suggests traveling with the tour operators she includes in many listings. It's probably the smart way to go in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, where cultural differences and language barriers may trip up the inexperienced or solo traveler. ""It's a great way to travel if your best friend or husband isn't available to go or interested in going,"" she said. An inexperienced English-speaking traveler can travel far away to New Zealand or Australia and enjoy the differences of a country that shares some common language and history. ""You'll hear this wonderfully accented English that is not your own, so you're always aware these are experiences you would never have had at home if you stayed within our borders."" Schultz said. ""It's exotic enough to be exciting and exhilarating, but easy enough to do solo -- minus that inherent risk of being in countries that are always on the front page of the newspaper, filling your head with risks,"" she said. For U.S. residents who prefer to stay within the United States, Schultz has added new entries on the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon and Washington state; the Georgia O'Keeffe Trail in Santa Fe and Abiquiu, New Mexico; and Grafton, Vermont. Chapters on popular cities such as New York, San Francisco and Kauai have turned into mega-entries. (Schultz has also written ""1,000 Places to See in the United States and Canada Before You Die."") Get out of your comfort zone . Explorers can expand their bucket lists by finding someplace they've never been before. Be the first in your family to explore the 11 underground churches excavated out of stone in the Ethiopian town of Lalibela. They've been in continuous use since the 12th century. Or head to Ghana's Elmina Castle, the first European slave-trading post in sub-Saharan Africa. There's also plenty to explore in Greenland, 85% of which is still covered by ice. The island, a self-governing territory of Denmark, says that global warming has created the fastest-retreating ice cap in the Northern Hemisphere. Still on Schultz's bucket list: Antarctica, which is very expensive and requires a significant time commitment; return visits to Italy, her first and always love; and the Arctic, where she has traveled but wishes to see again. And for the history buff, nature lover or luxury traveler, there's Eastern Europe, where the high life, nature and history can be found side by side. Schultz recommends getting to Eastern Europe before the sense of Soviet occupation can be found only in museums dedicated to remembering the past. ""Sometimes, they're so successfully erasing the period Soviets were there to the extent you wonder if they were ever there; and other times, you think, 'Oh, here I can still feel it,' "" Schultz said. ""You'd never know in many cases in Prague that the Soviets had been there. In the back roads of Romania, you'd think it's still under Soviet control.""","No longer dominated by the Soviets, Eastern Europe has the old and the new to discover .

"London (CNN) -- The bestselling erotic novel ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" may have done more than spice up readers' love lives. Firefighters in London say it could be to blame for a rise in the emergency calls from people stuck in all kinds of awkward situations -- some involving handcuffs. Read more: Explaining 'Fifty Shades' wild success . The wildly-popular trilogy details the S&M-flavored love story of a recent college grad and a billionaire CEO. It's also credited with boosting sales of sex toys, driving women to hook-up sites and fueling a craze over sexual domination. So, it's not surprising there would be a downside. In the past three years, London's fire crews have been called to 79 incidents involving people trapped in handcuffs. ""I don't know whether it's the Fifty Shades effect, but the number of incidents involving items like handcuffs seems to have gone up,"" said Third Officer Dave Brown. ""I'm sure most people will be Fifty Shades of red by the time our crews arrive to free them."" Such red-faced moments are among more than 1,300 calls involving people being trapped ""often in everyday household items"" since 2010, the fire service said. Such calls are not just awkward; they end up costing the taxpayer. London Fire Brigade puts the cost of these 1,300 calls at Â£377,000 ($580,000.) But it's not just London where E L James' erotic fiction has been making an impact. Virginia Representative Jim Moran said the trilogy is a hit in a camp housing high-value detainees within the Guantanamo Bay prison complex. ""Rather than the Quran, the book that is requested most by the (high-value detainees) is Fifty Shades of Grey. They've read the entire series in English, but we were willing to translate it,"" he said in an interview with The Huffington Post. The insight into the prisoners' reading habits was provided by military officials showing a congressional delegation around Camp Seven, the Democrat said. ""I guess there's not much going on, these guys are going nowhere, so what the hell,"" he is quoted as saying. The trilogy has sold more than 32 million copies in the United States alone since the first installment was published in 2011. With a film version due for release next year, London's firefighters may have to respond to many more calls. So, the fire brigade has a word of advice to offer: Use a little common sense.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A business management expert testified Monday as lawyers try to prove Michael Jackson's last concert promoter is liable in the singer's death. Human resources consultant Jean Seawright's analysis of AEG Live's hiring practices may lack the drama of last week's testimony by Jackson's oldest son, but it could be crucial for proving that the company negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray. The trial of the lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and three children began its tenth week with their lawyers nearing the end of their case. AEG Live lawyers are expected to start presenting their defense around July 15. AEG Live contends that Michael Jackson, not its executives, chose and controlled Murray, who is serving a prison sentence for an involuntary manslaughter conviction. If the jury decides that AEG Live executives have responsibility for Jackson's death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, they will then have to decide how much he might have earned in the years he didn't get to live. Nephew: Jackson was murdered . Prince and Blanket dancing . Jurors would have learned a lot about Michael Jackson's work and worth if they had traveled with the Jackson family to Las Vegas over the weekend for the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's ""Michael Jackson One"" show. Prince, 16, and Blanket, 11, sang and danced while watching the Cirque celebration of their father's music and life in a Mandalay Bay Casino theater. Paris, 15, was unable to attend because she is still hospitalized since last month's suicide attempt. The children never saw their father perform live, one of his motivations for attempting his comeback concerts, but thanks to technology Jackson appeared to be back on stage for a ghostly performance of ""Man in the Mirror."" Prince's appearance at the opening of the permanent show, which is different from Cirque's traveling ""Immortal"" show, came three days after he appeared in court to tell jurors about his father's life and last days. His father often cried after talking to AEG Live executives as he prepared for his comeback concerts, his oldest son testified Wednesday. ""After he got off the phone, he would cry,"" Prince Jackson testified. ""He would say 'They're going to kill me, they're going to kill me.'"" His father told him he was talking about AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips and his ex-manager, Dr. Tohme Tohme, Prince said. Negligent hiring? Seawright, who has worked as a human resources consultant for businesses for nearly 25 years was paid $300 an hour by Jackson lawyers to review documents and testimony on the wrongful death case. After about 100 hours, she said she reached an opinion about if AEG Live's hiring of Dr. Murray was negligent. ""They did indeed fail to follow adequate hiring practices,"" she testified Monday. Serving as a personal doctor for Michael Jackson was ""a very high risk position"" that warranted a background check to determine if Murray was fit for the job, competent to do the work and did not have a conflict of interest, Seawright testified. Jackson lawyers contend that Murray's deep debt, which included $1 million in foreclosures and judgments, made him conflicted since he could lose his $150,000 a month job if Jackson didn't make to rehearsals and perform his concerts. A simple credit check -- taking five minutes and costing less than $10 -- would have revealed the conflict of interest, she said. Credit checks are routine for many companies hiring for high-risk positions, she said. A key piece of evidence used by the Jackson lawyers is an e-mail sent by AEG Live CE Randy Phillips to ""This Is It"" show director Kenny Ortega on June 20, 2009 -- five days before Michael Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by Murray. ""This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig so he is totally unbiased and ethical,"" Philips wrote in an effort to assure Ortega Jackson was in good hands with Dr. Murray. Seawright testified that she found no evidence the company did anything to check out Dr Murray for fitness, competence or any conflict of interest that might lead him to provide unsafe treatments. AEG Live argues that it never hired Murray, but simply negotiated with him on Jackson's behalf. Seawrght said companies have the same obligation in hiring, whether for a regular employee or and independent contractor. Jury tampering? Jurors can expect to be watched more closely by court bailiffs after an incident near the end of Friday's session. Two alternate jurors told the judge that a woman approached them during a court break. ""She mention 'Please don't give anyone any money,'"" alternate juror No. 1 said. Alternate juror No. 5 quoted the woman, saying ""I just wanted to say not to award them any money."" While the woman apparently was opposed to the Jackson's lawsuit seeking billions of dollars in damages, AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam used the incident to suggest that the judge should crack down on Michael Jackson fans who wear Jackson shirts and carry signs of support for Katherine Jackson in the court hallway. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos rejected Putnam's request, saying Jackson fans have free speech rights that she cannot limit. Both alternate jurors said the incident would not affect their ability to make an impartial decision in the case.","NEW: AEG Live did ""fail to follow adequate hiring practices,"" expert says .

It's set in Detroit during the 1960s and chronicles the rise and perils of an all-girl R&B group -- a la Diana Ross and the Supremes and the glitzy 1981 Broadway show ""Dreamgirls"" and its 2006 movie adaptation. The project has been a labor of love for producer Debra Martin Chase for more than a decade. She and Houston, her film producing partner, scored with ""The Princess Diaries"" films and the made-for-TV movie, ""Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella."" As longtime fans of the original 1976 flick (written by an upstart Joel Schumacher), the duo yearned to bring it to a new audience. ""Just thinking back to why this movie was important to me as a teenager and I know why it was important to Whitney; it was really the first time we saw the fabulous women of color on the screen, who were glamorous, the men were gorgeous, the clothes were gorgeous,"" Martin Chase told CNN this week. ""In and of itself, it was inspirational."" The TriStar Pictures film, which has been virtually kept under lock and key from media for months, had showings this week in Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, New York and Los Angeles. It also stars Carmen Ejogo, Tika Sumpter, Mike Epps, Derek Luke and Omari Hardwick, with appearances by Cee Lo Green, Michael Beach, Kem, Terrence Jenkins and Tamela J. Mann. ""It's surreal. It's hard to believe that it's finally coming into fruition,"" Martin Chase said. ""It's like a lot of life lessons about believing in what you believe in and just sticking with your guns and just keep pushing forward to make it happen."" The road to post-production wasn't an easy one for this new ""Sparkle."" In the late 1990s, Warner Bros. Pictures struck a three-picture deal with then-rising R&B star Aaliyah. One of the star-making vehicles was to be ""Sparkle,"" to which the studio owned the rights. Under their BrownHouse Productions shingle, Martin Chase and Houston were tapped to help bring the remake to life. But shortly after Aaliyah's second film, ""Queen of the Damned,"" wrapped, tragedy struck when the singer died in a plane crash. The project languished for years. ""I took the idea to other studios and got a bunch of nos,"" Martin Chase said. ""I never gave up on it."" The names of singer/actresses such as Raven-Symone and Ashanti were bandied about at one time or another, but nothing materialized. During a dinner a few years ago at Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton's home, the idea of ""Sparkle"" once again came up. Unbeknown to Martin Chase, it was a ""passion project"" for the studio chief, too. From there, the remake received the green light. On the heels of the success of their 2010 feature film debut, ""Jumping the Broom,"" husband-and-wife creative team Salim and Mara Brock Akil -- already established forces in the television industry -- were tapped to direct and write the new movie. Redefining what it means to 'Sparkle' Salim Akil had his trepidation about taking on such a storied work. The original -- which featured a timeless score and soundtrack by Curtis Mayfield -- made stars out of Irene Cara, Philip Michael Thomas, Dorian Harewood and Lonette McKee. The legend of ""Sparkle,"" which predated the fabled musical ""Dreamgirls,"" would be a prized staple in black movie lovers' collections for years to come. ""I think with having conversations with my wife, Mara, and riffing on 'Well what if I did do it?' and 'I would do this, I would do that,' I felt like it's an opportunity to take us back to a time that was a little bit more innocent in terms of the way that we approached life back then,"" Akil said. ""I thought 1968 was an interesting year for America, and so I thought we could do something and present something that a younger generation could appreciate it."" Outside of the relatively small $15 million production budget (period movies usually start at around $50 million) and a marathon 30-day shooting schedule, casting was one of the biggest challenges for the new ""Sparkle."" Akil said he knew off the cuff he wanted to work with Epps, a renowned comedian, again after ""Jumping the Broom."" And as far as the leading role, Sparks -- who starred in Broadway's ""In the Heights"" in 2010 -- was a born natural. ""Jordin just has this quality about her that lends itself to innocence, and I needed that for 'Sparkle,' "" he said. ""I needed someone who, in this day and age, there was some innocence left. I wanted someone who was sort of (a) mystery to the public and who can sing her ass off, and she could definitely could do that."" However, the role of Sparkle's eldest, wilder sibling, Sister, proved less obvious once Paula Patton, also in the Akils' ""Jumping the Broom,"" couldn't do it because of a previous commitment. The director said he saw just about everybody in Hollywood to portray, what is arguably, the strongest role in the movie. And then a screen test of Ejogo, in full character, came his way. ""She had taped herself and it just blew everyone away, and I remember when I saw it, I sent a text to everyone that said: 'This is Sister. She is Sister' and in a lot of ways, you get what you need through blessings like that. I think she knocked it out of the park."" As far as the creative process, Akil left his wife to her own devices. ""I gave her five points that I would like to see and then I left her alone. Mara is a competent writer. I wanted her to write the movie because I knew she would do a great script,"" he said. ""And even though she wanted me to read the script before she was finished, I wouldn't because I didn't want to interfere with her process."" Some central plot points are different from the original film, but it is a remake in every sense of the term, according to Martin Chase. ""We've made some changes. And with approaching a remake, you want to preserve that which is most beloved about the original and you want to adapt it to a modern audience,"" she said. ""But at its heart, it's very much a remake. We've stayed true to the essence and basic plot of the original movie."" Outside the usual marketing push, the movie is making an impact in two other arenas: publishing and music. On August 7, Simon & Schuster released a novelization of ""Sparkle"" by best-selling author and journalist Denene Milner. ""It's a traditional triumph story and we knew that it would resonate with the audience similar to the movie,"" book editor Todd Hunter said. ""It had all the properties of love and lost. The product is a tremendous story, and in terms of publishing, that's what we're all about."" Last month, RCA Records released the original motion picture soundtrack featuring music from the movie produced by R. Kelly, Harvey Mason Jr. and the Underdogs and featuring what is believed to be Houston's final recordings. Early buzz on the movie has been good, and seeing Houston, whose role of the matriarch was originated by veteran actress Mary Alice, in her final movie role is expected to draw her fans. ""I'm excited, I'm not nervous,"" Salim Akil said. ""I think when I feel like I've done my job and I've respected the audience and respected the material, there's no reason to be nervous. I don't read reviews so I don't go down that road. So I'm just excited. I'm excited for all of the actors. I'm excited for people to see Whitney. I want them to see her, how beautiful she is and what a wonderful actress she is. This is the closest I think I'll come to giving birth."" '""Sparkle"" will be shown on more than 2,600 screens, Martin Chase said, which is considered a wide release. Most films catering to African-American audiences average between 1,500 and 2,000 theaters. ""We still live in an age where we don't have enough stories really dealing with African-American women, and dealing with their tensions and their conflicts,"" said black film historian and author Donald Bogle, who chronicled the original ""Sparkle"" and many other films in his seminal tome ""Brown Sugar: Over 100 Years of America's Black Female Superstars."" ""We still need movies about African-American women and not just movies like 'The Help,' where it's all about how they relate, basically, to white people. We need stories that are looking at African-American women and their particular conflicts and not just their romantic tensions but also their professional dilemmas,"" he said. ""I think with this new version of 'Sparkle,' I think people are going to show up. They've been waiting to see something like this.""","Producer says she's excited to see the film come to light after more than 10 years .

"London (CNN) -- If keeping track of friends was the first wave of social media, the next may be all about hooking up with strangers. Apps designed to connect like-minded people, both online and in the real world, are being promoted as potentially capable of generating the kinds of billions Facebook may or may not be worth. But to achieve this, tech companies must encourage users to make a leap into an unknown world and throw private information into a void. ""If we get this right, I cannot think of a bigger thing to be working on right now,"" said Paul Davison, CEO of Highlight, one of the most buzzed-about of such apps to emerge this year. ""We can take billions and billions of dollars."" Like other so-called ""social discovery"" apps, Highlight works by allowing a small online cloud of personal information to follow a user wherever their cellphone goes. Whenever two users pass in the street or walk into the same venue, Highlight compares their data and alerts them to things they share in common, such as friends, music or favorite TV shows. Why faces matter to Facebook . Davison, 32, sees this as a powerful way to solve an imperfect social world in which many people try but fail to find the right friends, partners or employees. ""There is serendipity everywhere,"" he told CNN this week at Le Web London, a tech conference that wraps up Wednesday. The event brings together some of the biggest names in social media innovation and its agenda showcases a number of data services which, like Highlight, attempt to steer us away from the vagaries of chance. ""But sometimes it just needs more engineering,"" he added. Davison is clearly not alone in thinking this. Since its launch in January, Highlight has received positive reviews from tech-industry journalists and was one of the most heavily hyped apps this spring at SXSW Interactive, the tech conference in Austin, Texas. A similar app, Glancee, was snapped up by Facebook in May. Davison won't disclose how many people have signed up for Highlight to date, but our tests in London this week revealed a relatively thin pool of users. (For context, another fledgling rival, Banjo, hit 1 million users in April.) He appears to be some way off from the fabled ""critical mass"" at which a network becomes an attractive user destination. To get there, he must first convince people of the value of sharing -- a task he acknowledges as tricky. ""People freak out, they say it's creepy,"" he said. ""And if they don't want to share, then that's fine, they don't have to. But the social benefits to this far outweigh any cost to privacy."" Davison, who is currently expanding Highlight's two-man operation with half a dozen new hires, said he believes users will be won over by the ability to validate peoples' identities via Facebook or other existing social media platforms, and by the limited space in which the data is broadcast. Facebook to show you adds based on your Web browing . ""We connect people over a 150-meter radius. There's something about a short sense of space that creates trust,"" he said. ""Trust is critical. We think about it all the time and we want to be a simple product that people love. We don't want to be too spammy, too aggressive or anything like that."" Davison said he is not entirely sure how he will monetize his creation. Still, he is confident that it has lucrative potential -- provided it can avoid being pigeonholed as a dating app or conference-networking tool. ""Both those are big markets, but if you focus on them you end up with a very vertical growth plan,"" Davison said. ""We want to go beyond that. We want something that everyone will use everywhere."" While some may doubt Highlight's ability to persuade a mass-market audience to share with strangers, Davison's goals aren't without precedent -- largely thanks to a trail blazed by similar app Badoo. Founded in 2006 by Russian entrepreneur Andrey Andreev, Badoo now connects 153 million people around the world. It is hugely successful in Europe and is currently pushing into the United States. Though it has a reputation as a dating site -- some news reports have described it as like Facebook, but for sex -- the motivation behind Badoo's hook ups are numerous, according to Benjamin Ling, the company's newly appointed chief operating officer. ""We're solving a fundamental need of humans to connect and meet with other people,"" Ling told CNN on the sidelines of Le Web. Could mobile apps save local news? Whereas Highlight focuses on specifically locating and identifying strangers in close proximity, Badoo casts its net much wider, linking like-minded souls in nearby neighborhoods and leaving it up to them to set up a physical rendezvous. Yet, said Ling, it recognizes that people are clearly willing to take a leap into the unknown. ""As children, we have no problem meeting people, but as we grow up it becomes harder,"" he said. ""The social friction increases. What we do is help reduce that friction."" Badoo makes money as a ""freemium"" service. There is no charge to join, but users can pay to promote themselves across the network in the same way that retailers optimize their position in Google searches. Ling said further revenues could soon come from advertisements. Badoo has already achieved the critical mass needed to make it a going concern and seems to have no problem persuading users to share personal details -- a fact that should be encouraging to Highlight and other, newer social startups. Like any dating or social site, however, it must combat users who post false identities. Mobile devices offer 'seductive' fantasy . ""The key thing in gaining trust is user choice. Users only share the information they want to share,"" Ling said. ""As with every open platform, it is open to abuse. We have the ability for our community members to flag abuse, and we have 250 moderators. We allow users to authenticate their profiles, via Facebook or Twitter or their mobile phones."" And, said Ling, he is confident the space will grow as society opens up to the possibilities of sharing with strangers. ""Teens growing up now are more comfortable with the online world, and so the cultural mores are beginning to change over time, and that makes us optimistic,"" he said. ""This model of interaction is going to be much more prevalent in the future.""","Mobile apps connecting strangers in real world might be ""the next Facebook""
Highlight connects mobile users within 150 meters based upon mutual friends or interests .
Badoo operates on same principle but covers more distance .

"Cairo (CNN) -- For a second day, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy's home was not spared from the wrath of protesters who remain unconvinced of his defense of recent controversial decisions. Dozens of protesters threw rocks and glass bottles at the home in Sharkia province Friday and tried to push aside a police barrier, said Alaa Mahmoud, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. Two policemen and several protesters were injured, and four people were arrested. Protesters also made their message clear at the presidential palace in Cairo, where thousands broke through a barricade and sprayed graffiti on the palace walls. Guards at the palace did not engage the protesters. Crowds also gathered at Cairo's Tahrir Square but were largely calm, unlike the night before. In remarks Thursday night -- his latest since the bloodiest stretch in two weeks of political unrest -- Morsy refused to back off the controversial edict he issued or his nation's upcoming constitutional referendum, saying he respects peaceful opposition to his decisions but won't stand for violence. On Friday, Egyptian Vice President Mahmoud Mekki told CBC, a private Egyptian TV station, that Morsy would consider postponing the referendum, so long as there are no legal challenges to the postponement. The president has agreed to delay the vote for expatriates until Wednesday, said chief of staff Refaa El-Tahtawy. That vote was previously set for Saturday. During his Thursday speech, the president condemned those involved in the clashes -- referring specifically to those with weapons and who are backed by members of the ""corrupt ... ex-regime."" He promised they'd be held accountable. Opinion: Morsy miscalculating Egyptians' rage . ""(They) will not escape punishment,"" the president said in a televised speech. Yet Morsy's threat not only failed to mollify many protesters on the streets, it further enraged them. Activists camped in the square chanted ""Leave! Leave! Leave!"" as the president talked. And minutes after the speech ended, the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Cairo was ""ablaze,"" state TV reported, citing witnesses. The Islamist group said on its website and Twitter that the building had come under ""a terrorist attack,"" with hundreds surrounding it. By early Friday, there was no sign of a fire or significant damage. The National Salvation Front, an umbrella group of opposition organizations, called for large-scale demonstrations against a government it says has ""lost legitimacy,"" said the group, as reported by the semiofficial al-Ahram newspaper. Such a call for action -- and the sustained presence in Tahrir Square -- suggests activists are undaunted by threats from Morsy and members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group tied to him. The group was banned under longtime President Hosni Mubarak but is now Egypt's dominant political force. On Twitter, the Brotherhood has said it will hold opposition figures ""fully responsible for escalation of violence & inciting their supporters."" iReport: Bloody clashes around Egyptian presidential palace . Adel Saeed, a spokesman for Egypt's newly appointed general prosecutor, said Friday morning that Hamdeen Sabahi, Mohamed ElBaradei and Amr Moussa are being investigated for allegedly ""conspiring to topple"" the government. All three are well-known internationally -- with ElBaradei being a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Moussa a onetime head of the Arab League -- and are now being probed for their role in the opposition against Morsy, who defeated all three in this year's presidential election. ElBaradei said on Twitter: ""I call upon all the national forces and figures not to participate in a dialogue that lacks all the basics of a truthful discourse. We support a dialogue that is not based on the policy of arm-twisting and forcing the status quo."" During an interview with Al-Arabiya, an Arabic news network, ElBaradei called on Morsy to postpone the referendum vote and to ""rescind the constitutional declaration."" He added that ""only then will the opposition engage in dialogue."" Those taking part in the protests around the North African nation say the scenes are similar to those of the 2011 uprising that led to Mubarak's ouster. This time, they say, dissent is being vigorously stamped out by Morsy's backers in government and on the street. Specifically, they spoke of thugs with knives and rocks chasing activists, presidential backers belittling opponents and pressure from various quarters to go home and be quiet. ""It's exactly the same battle,"" said Hasan Amin, a CNN iReporter. A November 22 edict by Morsy, in which he made his decisions immune to judicial oversight until a new constitution is voted upon, set off the latest wave of political unrest. And it's been growing -- and growing more violent -- in recent days. Opposition leaders have been clear in saying what would mollify them: Morsy must roll back his edict granting himself expanded presidential powers and must postpone a December 15 referendum on a proposed constitution, which they say doesn't adequately represent or protect all Egyptians. Morsy previously said the edict was necessary to defend the revolution, and his administration has insisted the proposed constitution was drafted legally. If people vote it down, the president said Thursday night that he'd form a new assembly to draft another constitution. Yet opposition activists haven't shown any indication that they trust Morsy on that or other counts. They accuse him of consolidating power for himself and the Muslim Brotherhood, in part by having an Islamist-dominated group push through the draft constitution. This internal strife has helped transform the area around the presidential palace in Cairo into a war zone. Streets littered with rubble and burned cars were defined by barbed-wire barricades, patrolling soldiers, parked tanks and armored personnel carriers. Read more: The factors driving Egypt's unrest . Beyond the popular unrest, Morsy's inner circle was shaken when Rafik Habib, the deputy head of the Freedom and Justice Party, resigned Thursday, party spokesman Ahmed Sobe said. Habib did not give a reason. His resignation brings to five the number of presidential advisers who have left in the past two days. It is the first, however, from the Freedom and Justice Party. Egyptian judges and media organizations also staged strikes to show their displeasure with the situation. And 11 organizations representing lawyers, journalists, writers, actors, musicians and tour guides said Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood were behind the violence, al-Ahram reported. The group said it would call for Morsy's ouster if the administration failed to protect protesters and ""fulfill the aspirations of the January 25 revolution,"" the newspaper said. Vice President Mekki asked critics Wednesday to submit their proposals for improving the constitution, and Morsy invited political opponents to a meeting Saturday at the presidential palace.

"(CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan is officially a free woman. A source close to the actress confirmed to HLN that Lohan, 27, has finished a court-ordered 90-day stay in rehab. Her next step is to spend a few days with a sobriety coach to ease her transition -- something that Lohan decided for herself, the source noted. The actress was smiling as she exited a California rehabilitation center, and the source with knowledge of her situation confirmed that she's doing great. Lohan's latest rehab stint was taken as an alternative to three months of jail time for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in March. The actress told Piers Morgan ahead of her treatment that she's been mandated by the court to go to rehab six times, with her previous stay occurring in 2010. ""I could write the book on rehab,"" Lohan told Morgan, although she said she approached this round with optimism. ""I look at it as a good thing,"" she said in May. ""I can come back afterwards and be fully focused on work."" It's true that work is already waiting for Lohan. The actress has signed up to guest host E!'s ""Chelsea Lately"" on August 5, and her new movie, ""The Canyons,"" will bow on Friday. She also signed a deal to sit down with Oprah Winfrey for an exclusive interview that will tape and air in August, in addition to allowing OWN's cameras to tape her post-rehab life for an eight-part docu-series slated to air in 2014. HLN's Selin Darkalstanian and CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.","Lindsay Lohan has completed 90 days in rehab .

"(CNN) -- North Carolina officials have pulled the license of one of 15 clinics in the state specializing in abortions, with the state citing alleged health and safety violations found during a recent inspection. Femcare medical clinic in Asheville was cited for 23 different violations, including failing to clean operating beds, using tape to hold the gas delivery system together, and not have a resuscitator available for patients. The clinic's license was suspended Wednesday, some two weeks after the inspection. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory last week signed a law requiring all abortion clinics to be held to the same standards as outpatient surgical centers this past Monday. North Carolina governor signs abortion bill into law . But the state Department of Health and Human Services said the Femcare inspection was part of a routine facilities check, and the passage of the state's recent abortion bill had nothing to do with the clinic's closure. In a news release, the state agency described what it called ""egregious violations of existing rules that revealed an imminent threat to the health and safety of patients"" at the Asheville facility. In a statement, Femcare said, ""Since the state's last site visit in August 2006 there have been no changes in our operating protocols,"" and went on to say, ""We expect to be in compliance soon with the required standards and will return to serving our patients as soon as possible.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has long banned the sale of certain books, but now it has banned media reports on the opening of a Taiwanese book chain in Shanghai. The Eslite bookstore -- which in Taiwan stocks titles banned on the mainland -- announced this week it had signed a letter of intent to lease 6,500 square meters spanning three floors in the Shanghai Tower, a new development that will be China's tallest when it opens in 2015. A source at the Shanghai Labor Newspaper confirmed to CNN that the paper's editor-in-chief on Thursday received a terse directive from the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Department not to report the deal. ""The matter about Taiwan Eslite Bookstore [intending] to open a branch in Shanghai should not be reported anymore,"" Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported the message as saying. The source, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the message was communicated by SMS text message, an unusual medium for propaganda directives to the media, which are typically delivered in writing. The directive did not provide a reason for the media blackout and a spokesman at the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Department told CNN he was ""not aware"" of the matter. Eslite's deputy communications manager, Jessie Lu, declined to comment on whether the media blackout would affect the bookstore in any way. ""Eslite respects the rules and regulations in mainland China, including those on the book market,"" she said. The bookstore chain also would not comment on which titles would be available at the new Shanghai branch although Lu acknowledged that the retailer would not be able to sell books banned by China at its mainland locations, including Taiwanese public intellectual Lung Ying-tai's book about the Chinese civil war, ""Big River, Big Seaâ€”Untold Stories of 1949."" Founded in 1989, Eslite is Taiwan's largest bookstore chain, with more than 40 locations, including a 24-7 branch in the capital of Taipei. Its multi-story flagship in Taipei, located a block from the iconic Taipei 101 tower, is wildly popular among locals and tourists. It opened its first overseas branch in August 2012 in Hong Kong, where titles banned on the mainland are freely available. While Hong Kong falls under Chinese sovereignty, the special administrative region enjoys a high degree of autonomy and is not subject to China's regulations on banned material.","China banned media coverage of opening of Shanghai bookstore by prominent Taiwan retailer Eslite .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama toasted a growing U.S. friendship with India at the first state dinner of his administration Tuesday, an evening of regal pageantry and symbolic politics in a tent on the White House South Lawn. ""To the future that beckons all of us,"" Obama said with glass raised toward his guest of honor, visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ""Let us answer its call. And let our two great nations realize all the triumphs and achievements that await us."" A tradition dating back to 1874, state dinners are the most treasured and formal honor a U.S. president can offer a foreign dignitary, and the most coveted invitation in Washington. The Tuesday night dinner showed Obama's intention to signal strong ties with the world's largest democracy and go his own way in navigating the pomp and tradition of White House customs. Traditionally, a new administration's first invitation goes to the leader of neighboring Canada or Mexico, though recent presidents also haven't followed that precedent. The event planned by first lady Michelle Obama emphasized eco-friendly themes such as White House-grown herbs and lettuce served to guests and sustainably harvested magnolia branches -- from species native to both India and the United States -- in arrangements adorning the tent where more than 300 guests wearing tuxedos and gowns were wined, dined and entertained. A White House document said common themes of state and official visits are ""forging friendships, exchanging knowledge and building bridges that last for years."" In a toast that followed Obama's, Singh praised his host's leadership and prompted applause by citing the charm of the U.S. first lady. Obama's election was ""an inspiration to all those who cherish the values of diversity, democracy and equal opportunity,"" Singh said, adding that India ""warmly applauded"" the Nobel Peace Prize awarded Obama this year for ""the healing touch you have provided and the power of your idealism and your vision."" ""We need to find new pathways of international cooperation that respond more effectively to the grave challenges caused by the growing interdependence of nations,"" Singh said. ""As two leading democracies, India and the United States must play a leading role in building a shared destiny for all humankind."" Obama, in a black tuxedo, and the first lady, in a dazzling cream gown with silver accents, greeted Singh and his wife, Gursharan Kaur, as they arrived, shaking hands on the White House steps and posing for pictures before leading their guests inside. Guests in tuxedos and evening gowns streamed into the White House for the historic social event, passing a line of journalists. In one humorous mishap, the cummerbund of Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, fell off as he and his wife walked in. The guest list included political allies, a few opponents, celebrities and members of the Indian diplomatic community. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made the list, but not her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Democratic colleagues of the president including other Cabinet ministers, several senators and top aides made the list, including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts (but not his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and White House Budget Director Peter Orszag. Ticker: See the list of expected attendees . A couple of Republicans also made it, notably Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Celebrities included Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, actors Alfre Woodard and Blair Underwood, CBS News anchor Katie Couric and New York Times columnist Tom Friedman. However, one name rumored to be included, but not appearing on the list, was Oprah Winfrey. The dinner, in a tent set up on the White House South Lawn with a view of the Washington Monument, featured round tables for 10 set in resplendent colors -- apple green, ruby, gold -- with floral arrangements of roses, hydrangeas and sweet peas in plum, purple and fuchsia. Place settings in fine china from three previous administrations -- Eisenhower, Clinton and George W. Bush -- were flanked by five pieces of silverware and crystal glasses. Place cards were in script -- ""The President"" and ""Mrs. Obama"" read two. A seasonal menu reflecting both American and Indian flavors started with a potato and eggplant salad made with White House-grown arugula and accompanied by an onion seed vinaigrette, according to the White House. Red lentil soup with fresh cheese followed, and then a choice of entrees -- roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, chick peas and okra for vegetarians, or green curry prawns, caramelized salsify and smoked collard greens. Dessert was pumpkin pie tart and pear tatin with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Each course was paired with a different wine, all of American vintage. The herbs and lettuces were harvested from the White House Kitchen Garden started by Michelle Obama, with honey from the White House beehive used to poach the dessert pears. Entertainment was by jazz vocalist Kurt Elling, Grammy and Academy Award-winner Jennifer Hudson, the National Symphony Orchestra directed by award-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch, Academy Award-winning Indian musician and composer A.R. Rahman, and The President's Own United States Marine Band. ""It's not every day you get to sing at the White House or even get invited to the White House,"" said Hudson, who said she would dress in a purple and black gown ""with the longest train I've ever worn"" and sing standards including ""The Very Thought of You,"" ""What a Difference a Day Makes"" and ""Somewhere."" Veterans of state dinners said the planning for such a trend-setting event is meticulous. ""It's stressful, it's very stressful,"" said Lisa Caputo, a press secretary for Hillary Clinton when she was first lady. ""What is the first lady going to wear? What will be served? How are the flower arrangements being done? There's a lot of protocol in terms of the serving line."" Every unit in the White House weighs in on the dinner's guest list, Caputo said, with a lot of thought going into who sits where. ""There's particular protocol in terms of who is seated at the president's table and the prime minister's table,"" Caputo said. ""But don't forget that an enormous amount of thought goes into that with the White House social office and the president and first lady in terms of who will round out the appropriate table, who will get along with who, what will be the dynamics of each table. ""Yes, of course it's social, but, of course, there's business done,"" Caputo said. The final list is ultimately decided by the president and the first lady, said Anita McBride, who was chief of staff for first lady Laura Bush. ""Of course, having friends and supporters is really important to share that kind of event, and it's also important for all the other guests that are there and the Indian members of the delegation to meet these people that are a cross-section of America,"" McBride said. Amy Zantzinger, who was a social secretary for President George W. Bush, said all state dinners are different, and an administration's first one is a big one. ""First they'll bring the newness -- the newness of the whole day because it's their first big dinner,"" she said. What makes a successful dinner? It's what you don't plan, Zantzinger said.

Tsvangirai was in the crash as well and suffered minor injuries. The prime minister returned to work last week. When Sean died, the prime minister was at a government retreat in Victoria Falls, where officials are attempting to come up with a blueprint to salvage the nation's collapsed economy. At the retreat, the government adopted a 100-day renewal plan, according to state media reports. The retreat was attended by Tsvangirai, President Robert Mugabe and government ministers.","Sean Tsvangirai, 2, found drowned in a swimming pool Saturday afternoon .

"(CNN) -- Police in Switzerland hunted Friday for two inmates who escaped in a prison break staged by a pair of armed accomplices. The two prisoners who escaped from Orbe prison Thursday evening were named by the Vaud canton's police department as serial criminal Adrian Albrecht, 53, and Milan Poparic, 34, a Bosnian national. Poparic was jailed for robbery of a jewelry store in Neuchatel and is part of the ""Pink Panthers"" group, the police statement said. According to the Interpol website, the Pink Panthers are behind armed robberies targeting high-end jewelry stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the United States. Drag queens, fake beards and chocolates: Notable diamond heists . The loosely associated network of criminals has hundreds of members and is believed to have stolen jewelry worth more than â‚¬300 million ($396 million) since 1999, it said. Several inmates were exercising in an outside area under the supervision of prison officers and private security guards when the two accomplices used vehicles to breach a gate and barbed wire barriers around the prison grounds. They brought two ladders to help Poparic and Albrecht escape over the barbed-wire of the prison yard, police said. At the same time, the accomplices directed bursts of automatic weapon fire toward the prison officers and security guards to keep them at bay. The security personnel were able to take cover and no one was hurt, police said. The four men then torched one of the two vehicles and drove off in the other, a gray-colored vehicle. Police patrols, canine teams and security officers are combing the area for clues to their whereabouts. The border guards and French police are also involved in the hunt for the four men, police said. Orbe, a town in Switzerland's western Vaud canton, or state, is not far from the French border.","Swiss police are hunting two escaped prisoners and their two accomplices .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The Bo Xilai saga -- the incredible story of elite politics, murder, intrigue and betrayal -- seems to be winding down with the trial and sentencing of Wang Lijun. And yet one question remains open: What will happen to the man once tipped for the top job in China? Wang, 52, the former police chief of Chongqing, this week was sentenced to 15 years for defection, cover up, bribe taking and abuse of power. He set off the Bo story on February 6, when he fled to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was an accomplice in a murder case. Read more: Wang Lijun: the cop at the heart of Bo scandal . After his request for asylum was turned down, Wang left the consulate and was taken away by Chinese officials. Wang's startling accusations triggered a series of events that led to the biggest political scandal to hit China in decades. Read more: China's Bo Xilai 'implicated' in murder . Gu and family aide Zhang Xiaojun were arrested in early April, suspected of poisoning British businessman Neil Heywood, who died in November in the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing, where Bo was the Communist Party chief. (Heywood's death was originally blamed on excessive alcohol consumption.) Read more: Gu Kailai, the woman who had it all . Shortly after, Bo Xilai, 62, the charismatic leader tipped for promotion into the highest echelon of power, was stripped of his top posts for ""serious breach of discipline."" In August, Bo's ""brain-and-beauty"" wife, was meted a suspended death sentence after a seven-hour trial. Days later, four senior Chongqing police officers were also sentenced to jail for covering up the murder. Read more: Bo looms large over party leadership . These trials and convictions have been carefully scripted and apparently timed to ""deal"" with Bo ahead of the planned leadership transition at the 18th Party Congress, which is expected to convene in Beijing sometime in October. China has released official accounts of the Wang Lijun trial, reported by the official Xinhua News Agency and regurgitated virtually word-for-word by the mainstream Chinese media. It said that Wang on January 28 told Bo that his wife was a suspect in the Heywood murder. The next morning, Bo scolded Wang and slapped him in the face, the report said. It tangentially accused Bo of trying to cover up the murder of Heywood. ""The murder of Heywood and the plot to cover it up were precipitating factors, but if the chief actors had all kept quiet, it seemed that they had a good cover story,"" said James Feinerman, law professor at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. ""Heywood's Chinese wife was unlikely to challenge the autopsy, and he had been cremated already."" Why did Wang Lijun decide to betray Bo? The official story left much room for speculations. ""Something made Wang fearful enough to seek shelter-- perhaps he felt he couldn't keep the story under wraps any more,"" Feinerman said. ""Once he started relating his fear to Bo, and got a very negative reaction, he knew he was goner."" China said the trials of Gu and Wang shows China's commitment to dispensing justice no matter who were involved. But legal experts who followed the proceedings, which were closed to the foreign news media and the general public, say that is debatable. Gu and her co-accused, they noted, were deprived of their own legal counsel and forced to accept a government-appointed lawyer. No defense witnesses were called. Defense lawyers did not have a chance to review the prosecution's evidence or to cross-examine witnesses. Some legal experts say her trial reinforces the widely held notion that despite three decades of legal reform, the Communist Party keeps an iron grip of many judicial proceedings in which law is used as a tool for political needs. Gu Kailai's statement at her sentencing, thanking the court for its magnanimity, inspired disbelief and ridicule. Ma Jian, an exiled Chinese novelist who lives in London, found her statement scripted. ""Not since Stalin's show trials of the trials of the 1930s,"" he wrote in a blog post, ""has a defendant so effusively praised a judge who seemed bound to condemn her at a trial where no witness or evidence against her was presented."" Said Feinerman: ""Gu Kailai was a highly successful lawyer at one time, but her pitiful plea and acceptance of the sentence she received after being denied the counsel of her choice shows that no one is immune from abuse of law in the PRC."" Ordinary China ridiculed the decision to spare Gu's life, saying a commoner would have been summarily executed for the murder of a foreigner. On Sina weibo, China's most popular microblog service, Gu was juxtaposed with Xia Junfeng, a food peddler on death row who fatally stabbed two city management functionaries after they beat him. ""A lawyer who commits premeditated murder gets a suspended death penalty, and a peddler who defends himself gets death,"" one posting said. ""This is the Chinese justice system."" Bo Xilai has not been seen in public since April. What fate awaits him? Experts have offered divided views over whether the party will put Bo before a criminal court or spare him and the leadership of the disgrace by simply meting out disciplinary punishment within the party. ""Some have argued for inner-party disciplinary charges, but that route seems to leave open the possibility of a comeback,"" said Joseph Fewsmith, professor at Boston University. ""In any event I still expect a decision before the 18th Party Congress opens."" ""If he (Bo Xilai) is not tried the public will not be satisfied,"" said Tong Zhiwei, a law professor at the East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai. ""People will be disappointed in the Chinese legal system if the authorities try to protect him from justice."" Fewsmith added: ""The leadership needs to explain what Bo's crime was, but I think they want to keep the charges narrow -- covering up Gu Kailai's crimes, possibly corruption. This will no satisfy supporters of Bo, but it avoids the open fight that might come if they raised the ideological issues."" Fewsmith expects the Communist Party's central committee, the 350-member policy making body, to convene in the next few days to decide on Bo's status in the party. ""It should accept Bo's resignation from various posts,"" he said. ""That would follow past precedents."" Bo's defenders have accused foes of exploiting the charges against Gu to topple Bo. He has not been given a chance to defend himself in public. Doubts remain. Wang Xuemei, a leading Chinese forensic scientist working for the Supreme People's Procuratorate, has cast public doubt on the conviction of Gu Kailai for murdering Heywood. Writing in a blogpost, she noted a ""serious lack of evidence"" that Gu killed Heywood. ""I feel very pained,upset and scared that our court believed the theory he was poisoned with cyanide,"" she wrote. Her post has since been deleted.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Bangladesh's high court has declared the registration of the country's largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, illegal. Jamaat is one of two main opposition parties and a constant thorn in the side of the ruling Awami League. With the declaration, Jamaat will not be able to take part in the country's upcoming general election -- certainly welcome news to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Opinion: Bangladesh on the brink . But such a ruling can also reignite a fresh round of political unrest in the South Asian nation. Drumbeat gets louder . Jaamat enjoys considerable support, particularly in rural areas. And periodically, it will summon the masses to swarm the capital city, Dhaka, as a reminder. But in recent months, the drumbeat to ban Jamaat has gotten louder, especially from progressive groups that point to the party's role during Bangladesh's struggle for independence in the early 1970s. Read more: Bangladesh Islamists rally for blasphemy law . Between one million and 3 million people were killed in the nine-month war. In 2010, Bangladesh set up a court that it called the International Crimes Tribunal to bring to justice those it accused in the massacre. Among those the court has convicted of crimes against humanity are several top Jamaat leaders. Jamaat acknowledges that it opposed Bangladesh's struggle for independence, but it has decried what it calls a smear campaign. It has also questioned why the ruling Awami League is only now pressing forward on war crimes trials when it didn't do so while in power during the 1970s and 1990s. A petition to ban . The court case calling for its ban resulted from a petition filed in 2009 by Bangladesh Tariquat Foundation, a Sufi organization that wants to make Bangladesh a secular nation. Read more: American says he would die for justice in Bangladesh . The petition said Jamaat is a religiously-steeped political entity that actively worked to undermine the independence movement.

But the fear of violence igniting from such a ruling is all-too-real. Every time one of Jamaat's top leaders have been convicted by the war crimes tribunals, angry Jamaat supporters have clashed with police. Since February, at least 150 protesters have been killed and at least 2,00 wounded in such clashes, the Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday.

"(CNN) -- The last time most New Yorkers focused on pillaged antiquities from Cambodia was likely after the release of the Angelina Jolie film ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" which featured the heroine's adventures through the country's famous archaeological wonder, Angkor Wat. Now, real ""tomb raiding"" is making the news as the Cambodian government seeks to recover antiquities allegedly plundered from the kingdom's ancient sites during its civil war, ethnic cleansing and foreign occupation. At Cambodia's request, the United States recently filed suit in U.S. District Court against Sotheby's in New York, demanding that the auction house forfeit a sandstone warrior that was ""illicitly removed,"" according to the complaint, from a remote jungle temple. But according to a recent New York Times story, Cambodia has now set its sights on another Manhattan institution: the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has specifically targeted the highlight of its Southeast Asian collection: two kneeling figures that archaeologists declare are companions to the contested Sotheby's piece. If these stones could speak, what a story they would tell. Carved in the 10th century by some of the most skilled artisans known to history, they originally adorned the sanctuary of Prasat Chen, at the temple complex of Koh Ker. Experts believe that with other characters, they formed a three dimensional tableau from the Hindu epic the Mahabharata for a millennium. They say that came to an end when paramilitary groups trafficked them, sculpture by sculpture, overseas. What a strange twist of fate: Having traveled halfway around the world, quite possibly through the illicit and licit markets, the three disputed objects are now just miles apart in New York City. Phnom Penh's forceful request for their return has alarmed the less scrupulous in the art world, and with good reason: They have a lot to lose if the art is repatriated. American and European galleries, auction houses and museums are allegedly full of Cambodian plunder. Many of these artifacts were allegedely stolen during the country's long conflict, making them ""blood antiquities,"" little different than ""blood diamonds"" from Sierra Leone and other war-torn African states. The years before, during, and after the Killing Fields decimated the Cambodian population and led to the looting of most of the nation's archaeological sites. Yet sadly, now that Cambodia is at peace and in a position to recover its rightful property, some collectors are portraying themselves as the victims. In the wake of the Sotheby's case, one Asian specialist lamented the ""crisis"" now facing collectors. She warned that such legal actions ""threaten the very future of collecting and collecting museums"" and the ""next generation of collectors, donors and patrons."" Such histrionics aside, it will always be difficult and expensive for countries such as Cambodia to recover their pillaged heritage through the courts, even when in the right. Especially when its acquisition may have been made possible by tragedies such as the Holocaust, Cambodia's killing fields or even the more recent looting of the Baghdad Museum during the Iraq war, the real issue is why any collector or museum would want to possess stolen art? Thankfully, individuals and institutions who would argue to keep looted art are a minority and do as much disservice to their fellows as they do to victims of the illicit art trade. Indeed, many have voluntarily repatriated antiquities to Cambodia, once learning they were wartime plunder. The Met is no exception, having itself returned a valuable piece to the country in 1997 at its own initiative. There is much common ground between archaeologists, collectors and curators, as all share a love of the past, if not an outright obsession with it. Archaeologists recognize that there will always be, and should be, a legal market for antiquities, just as most collectors and curators agree that the looting of archaeological sites and trafficking of antiquities must be stopped. Indeed, if there is to be any real progress, both sides of the issue will likley have to make concessions. But as campaigns like Cambodia's demonstrate, the art world must reconsider what is ethically acceptable. And today, the sale, purchase and exhibition of ""blood antiquities"" is not only deplorable, it may actually be criminal. (The sale, possession, and transport of stolen property is illegal under the National Stolen Property Act.) Sotheby's and the Met have a choice: They can treat Cambodia's requests as obstacles, or recognize them as the opportunities they are to right past wrongs and set the moral standard for the entire field. For Cambodia's sake, as well as their own -- and for all of humanity that finds these treasures important -- let us hope that they choose wisely. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Vlasic and Tess Davis.","Writers: Met and Sotheby's have ancient figures thought to have been looted in Cambodia .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwean President Mugabe joined mourners Tuesday at a church service for Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's wife, who was killed last week in a car wreck. Robert Mugabe speaks at the memorial service for Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's wife, Susan. ""We are doing our best that we create a conducive environment and tell our supporters that the issue of violence must end,"" Mugabe told hundreds of people at a service at Mabelreign Methodist Church in Harare. Afterward, about 30,000 people gathered at Glamis Stadium in Harare to remember Susan Tsvangirai. Many wiped away tears as speakers addressed them, and some later held up signs that said, ""We miss you mother,"" and ""Goodbye Mama."" Tsvangirai, wearing dark sunglasses, stood impassively during one part of the ceremony. The service at the stadium was an extension of the church service, as the church could not accommodate all those who wanted to attend, Tsvangirai's spokesman, James Maridadi, told CNN.  Watch Tsvangirai at the memorial service » . ""Most of us are in pain, but the majority of us are so shocked we could not feel the pain,"" Movement for Democratic Change Secretary-General Tendai Biti told the crowd at Glamis Stadium, according to a MDC statement. Susan Tsvangirai was ""an activist and revolutionary in her own right,"" Biti said. ""She believed in the same values as her husband in wishing to bring about democratic change in Zimbabwe through a new, people-driven constitution."" Biti said Susan Tsvangirai had given support and guidance to her husband, the longtime opposition leader and head of MDC. ""As a result, we must take her passing on as an inspiration and must stop feeling pity for ourselves,"" Biti said, the MDC statement reported. The couple was traveling Friday from Harare to their rural home in Buhera when a truck collided with their vehicle, killing Susan Tsvangirai. The prime minister suffered minor injuries in the wreck, which occurred along a busy two-lane highway. Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Harare, told CNN the truck belonged to a U.S. Agency for International Development partner who delivers medical supplies as part of a U.S.-British program. Edwin Tsvangirai, the prime minister's eldest son, also spoke Tuesday to those gathered at the stadium, and said he saw the president differently after hearing Mugabe's words at the church service. ""I would like to thank the president of Zimbabwe for his words today that made me change my understanding of him,"" he said. Mugabe said the government will provide a state-assisted funeral for Susan Tsvangirai, who will be buried in Buhera on Wednesday. Some people traveled long distances to attend the stadium service. Marriam Garwe said she traveled 200 kilometers (124 miles) to be there. ""I want to pay my last respects to Mrs. Tsvangirai,"" said Garwe, 43, who is from Mutoko. ""I am sad that she died before Mr. Tsvangirai is the president."" Members of the MDC initially said that the prime minister believed Friday's crash was an assassination attempt. Tsvangirai dismissed those assertions on Monday. ""When something like that happens there is speculation, but I want to assure you, if it was foul play it is one in a thousand,"" he said after returning home from neighboring Botswana. ""It was an accident that unfortunately took her life.""  Watch Tsvangirai say there was 'no foul play' » . After the crash, Biti said police should have provided better security for Tsvangirai. The wreck might not have happened, he said, if a police escort had been on hand. Tsvangirai has long been a leading opposition figure in Zimbabwe. His agreement to join the coalition government with Mugabe last month seemed to resolve an impasse created by the disputed presidential election between Mugabe and Tsvangirai last year. Tsvangirai received the most votes in the March 2008 election, but he fell short of the 50 percent required to avoid a runoff. He withdrew as a candidate in the runoff, citing political violence and intimidation targeting his supporters. Negotiations between the two sides culminated in the power-sharing agreement..","Hundreds of people gathered at the Glamis Stadium in the capital, Harare .

"Koh Samet, Thailand (CNN) -- A picture postcard beach on one of Thailand's most popular tourist islands is now the focus of frantic efforts to staunch a tide of oil sweeping ashore. Where pleasure seekers would normally relax on pristine white sand, sandwiched between two lush green headlands, now white-coated cleanup crew smeared with crude suck oil from the shallow waters. Gobbets of oil lie along the beach, a thin sheen covers much of the wet sand and oil-drenched booms lie like giant black snakes along the shoreline. The sea is a rust red color and the odor of fuel hangs heavy in the air. Not even a brisk onshore wind can keep the smell away. For the past four days crude has been washing up here and cleanup crews have been dealing with it the best way they can -- pumping it into holding tanks, containing it with booms, even mopping it up with absorbent pads. READ MORE: Oil spill threatens 'tourism, fishing' Ao Prao beach on the island of Koh Samet is the main impact zone of the 50,000 liters of oil (around 13,200 gallons) spilled during a faulty transfer operation between a tanker and a seabed pipeline on Saturday. About 600 soldiers, volunteers and workers from PTT Global Chemical, the partially state-owned oil giant that has claimed responsibility for the spill, are involved in the cleanup. A PTT spokesman says that 70% of the oil has been dealt with. The remaining crude will be ""90% clear by Friday or Sunday at the latest."" In some ways Thailand has been lucky. There are more than 200 oil installations in the Gulf of Thailand, which co-exist uneasily in an area known as the marine bread basket of the country. This spill appears to have been contained to one -- more remote -- beach on the island. The more popular resort areas a few kilometers further south say there is little evidence of the spill. That's not stopping the tourists leaving though. Resort operators say many have left, fearing their holiday will be ruined. But this is low season here with occupancy around 30%. The economic damage would have been far worse a few months from now when most tourists visit, many from the capital Bangkok, 230km to the northwest. Local fisherman say they've caught fewer fish over the last few days, but it's too early to estimate the damage to fish stocks. There are no signs of affected marine or bird life at Ao Prao. The focus is now switching to how this happened. A PTT spokesman told CNN that the leak on Saturday happened as a tanker was transferring crude to an undersea pipe. A giant flexible rubber hose used to transport the oil began to leak. The hose is replaced every two years. This one had been in operation for just one year. It's being sent to the manufacturer, Goodyear, for further tests. PTT is also defending accusations that it has underplayed the amount of oil that leaked. According to academics at two universities, satellite pictures of the spill, and the amount of dispersants used suggests it could have been twice as big -- 100,000 liters or about 26,000 gallons. PTT says it is ""confident"" of its own calculations. The Thai energy ministry has promised the results of an investigation within seven days. Meanwhile the cleanup continues. It's a race against time. Every day, the pictures of the spill are flashed around the world increases the likelihood that tourists -- so important to this country's economy -- will go elsewhere for their fun in the sun.","Crews working to clean up oil spill on Thai beach at Koh Samet .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court has ordered Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to face a contempt of court hearing this week, officials said, setting up a potential showdown between the nation's judicial and political leaders. The Pakistani leader responded Monday night by saying he has ""always respected the courts, and I will present before the court."" At the same time, he pushed back against the military and the judiciary branch in the name of ""democracy."" ""The army and the judiciary, they both have to protect democracy in Pakistan,"" Gilani said in a televised speech Monday night. ""They can't remove democracy. They can't pack up the system."" The notice was issued for the government's failure to reopen thousands of corruption cases against politicians and bureaucrats, including President Asif Ali Zardari. ""Ultimately it's the prime minister who is responsible for carrying out the court's order and he has not. I think the court has lost its patience,"" said Ahmad Bilal Mehboob, the head of the Islamabad-based political think tank the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency. The court has not found Gilani in contempt or convicted him of a crime. But if he is convicted, the court could disqualify Gilani as a member of Parliament, which would make him ineligible to be prime minister, Mehboob said. The court ordered Gilani to appear in person before the court Thursday, where he will have an opportunity to defend himself. Even before Gilani's speech, Pakistan's government said the prime minister would comply with the order. ""The history of our party is filled with sacrifices, and we are ready for it again. We have accepted all of the court's decisions,"" Information Minister Firdous Ashiq Awan said. It will likely ""take a while"" before the court rules, Mehboob said. News of the notice of contempt came hours before Pakistani lawmakers voted Monday on a resolution supporting the country's democratic system after weeks of public speculation and political intrigue about the possibility of a coup in the volatile nation. That resolution supporting ""the democratic system"" and parliament was passed, Gilani said in his speech Monday night. At the same time, a panel appointed by the Supreme Court is holding a hearing on a scandal over an anonymous memo that has severely strained relations between military and civilian authorities. The controversial, unsigned memo was allegedly drafted by the civilian leadership and asked the United States to help rein in the military. The so-called ""memogate"" scandal has unleashed waves of political intrigue in recent weeks. Local media have described a government on a collision course with its own army. Last month, Gilani spoke provocatively of plots to topple the government. Later, he accepted an army statement pledging support for the democratic process. Last week, tensions spiked after he fired his defense secretary. The move came after Pakistan's military issued a statement warning of ""grievous consequences"" after a Gilani interview in The People's Daily Online of China. In it, the military said, Gilani accused the army's chief of staff and the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency of violating the constitution. Leaders appeared to be making an effort to ease tensions over the weekend, with several high-profile meetings between civilian and military officials. Government officials and members of Gilani's Pakistan Peoples Party defended the prime minister Monday. ""The prime minister is not in jeopardy,"" said Seyed Abid Ali Shah, a lawmaker representing the Pakistan Peoples Party. Federal Law Minister Maula Bakhsh Chandio told reporters in Islamabad that Gilani would remain in his post. ""All the conspiracies against the government will fail and all the analysis will prove incorrect,"" he said.","NEW: Pakistan's prime minister says that he will appear in court Thursday .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Days after a prominent Yemeni human rights activist became the first Arab woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, dozens of women were injured after gangs attacked during a march in her honor, witnesses in the city of Taiz said Monday. Thousands of women gathered in the southern Yemeni city to celebrate Tawakkol Karman's honor Sunday. Demonstrators also called on the international community to support a revolution in Yemen, witnesses said. At least 38 women were injured by rocks and batons when pro-government gangs attacked at Sunday's march, said Yasser al-Nusari, a medic in Taiz's Freedom Square. Abdulhaleem Al-Madashi, a spokesman for the protest movement there, corroborated that account. The Yemeni government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Abdullah Sabri, a youth activist in Taiz, said that pro-government thugs using batons and rocks attacked. ""It's a shame to attack women.... Rocks were randomly thrown directly towards the female marchers,"" Sabri said. Female protesters marched in three Yemeni provinces on Sunday --Taiz, Shabwa and Sanaa. The largest took place in Sanaa where at least 15,000 females marched down the capital's Cairo Street. In Shabwa, thousands of women also march in support of Karman, calling on the United Nations to impose sanctions against President Ali Abdullah Saleh's ruling family. Prominent Yemeni human rights activist Khalid Al-Anesi, based in Sanaa, received numerous reports of the attacks and injuries in Taiz and holds Saleh's regime responsible. ""They want to make people afraid to demonstrate,"" Al-Anesi told CNN. ""Women heard that Tawakkol Karman had won the Nobel Prize and they wanted to come out to support her winning. Then more women started planning to demonstrate and women had huge marches yesterday in Yemen,"" he said. ""During the Taiz march, pro-Saleh gangs attacked women marchers and over 20 were injured. This is a way for Saleh's government to send a message that women shouldn't demonstrate."" At Sunday's march in Taiz, protesters also called on the United Nations to intervene in forcing Saleh to step down from power and repeated a refrain for Saleh to be tried. ""Saleh Saleh will stand trial,"" women chanted as they marched for more than three hours, according to witnesses. Government supporters also verbally harassed some female marchers, witnesses said.","NEW: Witnesses: At least 38 women were injured during a march in Taiz Sunday .

The cable begins with a visit by U.S. diplomats to President Nursultan Nazarbaev's horse farm, which has ""a large stable, indoor and outdoor riding arenas and a clubhouse"" as well as about 40 horses from various parts of the world. ""Nazarbaev is also fond of traveling to warmer climes,"" the cable continues, mentioning that he had traded local property for a ""palace"" in the United Arab Emirates. Quoting Turkish officials, the cable adds that the Kazakh president also had a mansion in Turkey. Other Kazakh officials also come under the spotlight, with a detailed account of Prime Minister Karim Masimov's visit to a nightclub called Chocolat in the capital, Astana. Apparently, the prime minister was quite the dancer: ""His companions quickly tired but Masimov remained, dancing alone and animatedly for another 15-20 minutes."" Later, the cable describes a dinner held for a visiting U.S. delegation by one of Kazakhstan's wealthiest men, Aleksandr Maskevich. ""It is not clear what Maskevich is spending his billions on,"" the cable continues, ""but it is certainly not culinary talent."" The menu featured boiled meat and noodles, and ""the wait staff appeared to be graduates of a Soviet cafeteria trading academy."" In a section entitled ""Private Concerts With The Stars,"" the cable describes the 2007 birthday celebrations of the president's son-in-law, Timur Kulibayev. Not only were Russia's biggest pop stars on hand, ""The headliner was Elton John, to whom he reportedly paid 1 million pounds ($1.55 million) for this one-time appearance."" CNN has reached out to John's representatives for comment. In the same year, singer Nelly Furtado was reportedly flown in to perform for Nazarbaev's daughter. It seems that being posted to Kazakhstan was rarely dull, as far as characters are concerned. The leaked cable ends with a florid description of then Defense Minister Daniyal Akhmetov, who ""appears to enjoy loosening up in the tried and true 'homo-sovieticus' style -- i.e. drinking oneself into a stupor."" It recounts a meeting between the minister and a senior U.S. Defense Department official in June 2007. ""Slouching in his chair and slurring all kinds of Russian participles, Akhmetov explained to this very senior guest that he had just been at a cadet graduation reception, 'toasting Kazakhstan's newly-commissioned officers.' "" Spotting the opportunity for a zinger, the cable's author observes: ""Who was toasted more -- the Defense Minister or the cadets -- is a matter of pure speculation.""","Dispatch from U.S. Embassy tells of free-flowing liquor, visits from stars .

"(CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates will try 94 people on charges of seeking to seize power, the UAE's state news agency WAM reported Sunday. Most of them were detained in September and are only now being charged, CNN learned. ""They launched, established and ran an organisation seeking to oppose the basic principles of the UAE system of governance and to seize power,"" Attorney General Salem Saeed Kubaish said in a statement published by WAM. Those arrested were sent to to the Federal Supreme Court. The group is apparently part of an organization that Kubaish said was established to teach the ""virtues of Islam."" It intended to take over the government and ""oppose the basic principles of the system,"" he said. The suspects are accused of using social media to attempt to turn public opinion against the government and its leadership. Some of the suspects are allegedly part of a group called al-Islah. Islah means reform. Abdullah Al-Hadidi, son of 53-year old detained al-Islah member Abdulrahman Al Hadidi, spoke with CNN. ""We are not political opposition,"" Al-Hadidi said. ""We know he is not guilty of these charges. I am also a member of al-Islah, and we are proud of Islah. They want us to admit (to crimes) to turn public opinion against us."" He said that contrary to news reports in the region, al-Islah is not a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned in the UAE. The Brotherhood is one of the largest political groups in the region. It came to power in Egypt after a revolution that unseated President Hosni Mubarak and brought sweeping changes to that country. The UAE was not rocked by Arab Spring protests like Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and other nations in the region. ""It is the responsibility of those making this accusation to offer proof,"" Al-Hadidi said. ""We do not deny we have been influenced by some of the ideas of the Muslim Brotherhood, much as we've been influenced by some of the ideas of capitalism or any other ideology that we are surrounded by. ""But we are not a branch,"" he continued. ""We have taken on the best of each ideology and left out what may not be beneficial to our county."" He said the group has secularists. He also stressed that it's not an international group or movement. The government accuses the group of meeting in secret ""in their houses and farms"" to organize their plot to ""seize power and the state's system's governance,"" according to a statement on the official news agency WAM. The detainees are also accused of receiving financial support and expertise from the Muslim Brotherhood ""to serve their undeclared goal of seizing power.""","NEW: Most of the suspects were detained in September and are only now being charged .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- Four Israeli soldiers were wounded and five Palestinians, including a militant, were killed Saturday as the two sides traded fire. An anti-tank missile was fired at an Israel Defense Force patrol, wounding the soldiers, according to the IDF, which targeted several sites in the Gaza Strip in retaliation. Four Palestinians were killed and more than 20 wounded when Israeli tank fire hit a building east of Gaza City where hundreds of mourners were gathered for a funeral, Palestinian medical sources said. About half of those injured were in a serious condition, the medical sources said, and the number of deaths could rise. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the country's forces will not let ""the grave events on the border"" go unnoticed. The IDF also said it targeted a rocket launching squad in the northern Gaza Strip after it fired rockets toward Israel. More than 30 rockets fired from Gaza hit southern Israel, the IDF said. An IDF strike west of Gaza City killed a militant and wounded four, one of whom is in critical condition, according to security sources with Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007. The militant was from Al-Saraya, the military wing of Islamic Jihad, they said. In a separate incident, Palestinian medical sources in Khan Younis, in the south of the Gaza Strip, said an Israeli artillery shell hit a civilian house and injured a couple and their two children.

"Moscow (CNN) -- A Moscow court has reduced the sentences of jailed Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his former business partner Platon Lebedev by two years, the Russian Legal Information Agency said Thursday.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's former President Pervez Musharraf is expected to be indicted next week in connection with the death of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, his lawyer said. Musharraf is not expected to be charged with murder, but over his alleged failure to provide adequate security for Bhutto, the lawyer Ahmed Raza Kasuri said Tuesday. Bhutto, Pakistan's first female prime minister, was assassinated in a gun-suicide attack in December 2007, shortly after she came back to Pakistan from self-imposed exile to take part in the 2008 general elections. Musharraf was president at the time. Pakistani politicians choose PM's ally as president . A long investigation . Investigators said former Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud plotted the assassination and paid the equivalent of about $4,500 to a network of Islamist militants to carry out the killing. But they also accuse Musharraf of failing to protect Bhutto. They say Musharraf rejected Bhutto's request to use a western private security contractor for protection when she returned to Pakistan. They suggested Musharraf intentionally left Bhutto vulnerable because he felt politically threatened by her return. The former military ruler has denied having anything to do with Bhutto's killing. Musharraf's lawyer said the charges expected next week are politically motivated and that Musharraf plans to plead not guilty. An investigation into Bhutto's killing has lasted nearly six years. In May, gunmen killed a leading prosecutor working on the case, Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali. Prime minister: Musharraf should stand trial for treason . Reversal of fortune . Musharraf appeared Tuesday before an anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi that's hearing the case, Kasuri said. The former military ruler is due to return to the court on August 6, when he is expected to be indicted, he said. After the general elections in 2008 where his party was trounced, Musharraf stepped down as the governing coalition began taking steps to impeach him. He himself then went into self-imposed exile. Earlier this year, he returned to Pakistan in an attempt to revive his political career. It didn't work. Instead, he's become entangled in a thicket of court cases related to his time as the country's top leader. He has been under house arrest since April. Musharraf did receive one piece of good news Tuesday when the court in Rawalpindi agreed to unfreeze his assets in Pakistan and abroad.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Marines stationed in southern Europe have been put on alert as a precaution in advance of expected large demonstrations and potential unrest in Egypt this weekend, CNN has learned. About 200 combat capable Marines in Sigonella, Italy, and Moron, Spain, have been told to be ready to be airborne within 60 minutes of getting orders to deploy, according to two administration officials. The units have several V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft that would carry troops and infantry weapons to Egypt to protect the U.S. Embassy and American government personnel and citizens if violence broke out against Americans. The planned demonstrations are aimed against the Egyptian government. The officials both emphasized this is contingency planning in advance of the expected demonstrations to ensure American military assets, including rescue forces, can act if needed. In the event Americans had to be evacuated from Egypt and could not get to the airport due to the unrest, there are about 2,000 additional Marines on board three Navy warships in the Red Sea, officials said. A third official said the decision to keep the warship in the Red Sea was ""very precautionary."" The United States expects Egyptian security forces will be able to protect American assets and personnel. No plans for personnel to leave have been announced, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Friday. ""This is not Libya,"" said the third official, alluding to last year's attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi. During that attack, the military was unable to muster resources fast enough to protect the mission. Four Americans, including the ambassador to Libya, died in the attack. Since then, after much criticism from Congress about the inability to respond, the Pentagon has been particularly sensitive about ensuring troops are within deployment distance of potential trouble spots in North Africa. The embassy had already planned to be closed Sunday and Monday because of the demonstrations, according to a notice on the embassy's website. American citizens in Cairo have been advised to avoid areas where the demonstrations are taking place and ""limit their movements.""","Large demonstrations are expected in Egypt this weekend .

"(CNN) -- This time, history didn't repeat itself. Democratic Rep. Ed Markey Tuesday won a special U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, topping Republican businessman and former Navy SEAL Gabriel Gomez in an election marked by low voter turnout. The contest was the second time in three years that Massachusetts voters headed to the polls in a special U.S. Senate election with national implications. In January 2010, little-known Republican state Sen. Scott Brown upset Martha Coakley, the Commonwealth's Democratic attorney general, in a contest to fill the remainder of the term of longtime Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy, who died the previous summer. Brown's victory set the stage for the GOP wave in the November 2010 midterm elections. Fast forward three years, and this time there was no upset. With 100% of precincts reporting, Markey led Gomez 55%-45%, according to local media reports. Markey, who had led in all the pre-election public opinion polls, will serve the remaining year and a half of the term of longtime Democratic Sen. John Kerry, who stepped down earlier this year after being confirmed as U.S. secretary of state. Humble beginnings . In his victory speech, the 20-term congressman talked about his humble beginnings. ""I was the first in my family to go to college. I drove an ice cream truck to work my way through Boston College as a commuter. But thanks to the opportunities this country gave me, this son of a milkman is going to serve the state of Massachusetts in the United States Senate,"" said Markey. Markey, 66, held his election night victory party in Boston's Park Plaza Hotel, the same hotel where Brown celebrated his upset victory in 2010. Brown, who lost his Senate seat last November when he was defeated by Democrat Elizabeth Warren, passed on running in this special election, setting the stage for Gomez, who had never held public office. ""We can be proud of what we accomplished, literally starting from scratch five months ago. Nobody knew who I was outside of Cohasset, a couple of little league baseball teams and the amazing people I worked with. But look at us now,"" said Gomez in his concession speech about 90 minutes after the polls closed in the Bay State. National Democrats, taking no chances this time around, greatly outspent national Republicans in the contest, which Gomez acknowledged in his remarks. ""We were massively overspent. We went up against literally the whole national Democratic party and all its allies and the machine. But in face of all this diversity, we could not have fought a better fight,"" added Gomez, 47. No Republican upset . While the GOP looked to comparisons to the 2010 special election and Gomez aides predicted a shocker, much has changed since Brown's upset victory. President Barack Obama's health care measure was facing key votes in Congress at the time, and Brown's victory gave Republicans a key 41st seat in the Senate, allowing them to filibuster Democratic initiatives such as Obamacare. The tea party movement, formed less than a year earlier, was on the rise, and played an important role in support of Brown, a charismatic candidate. And many national and state Democrats took the seat for granted as it had been in the party's hands for decades. While there was still a lot at stake in this election (a GOP upset in Tuesday's contest would take a bite out of the Democrats current slim 54-46 majority in the Senate), and while partisanship is still just as bitter in the nation's capital, the climate has changed a bit, the seat was not considered a crucial vote in any upcoming legislation and the face received much less national media attention than the 2010 campaign. Low turnout . Special elections often draw low turnout, and this race was no an exception. With many of the high profile names deciding against running, the contest was generating little interest with the public even before it was overshadowed by April's Boston Marathon bombings, which killed three people and injured nearly 300. Combine that with possible voter fatigue (this was the third Senate election in the state in the past three and a half years) and a heatwave on Election Day, and it all added up to an apparently record low voter turnout for the contest, far below the 52% turnout in the 2010 special contest. Concerned about low turnout, the biggest names in the Democratic Party all traveled to Massachusetts to lend Markey a helping hand. In the past three weeks, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, former President Bill Clinton and first lady Michelle Obama all campaigned with Markey. In an e-mail following Markey's victory, the Democratic National Committee said that they ""built two predictive voter models to gauge support for Markey and turnout, applying the lessons learned from the Obama Campaign's 2012 innovative modeling efforts."" And a memo from Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that ""the lesson from Scott Brown's accidental win in 2010 was that Democrats must never take a race for granted. Months before Senator John Kerry resigned to become Secretary of State, the DSCC began preparing for a likely special election in Massachusetts."" A rematch? Markey will succeed William ""Mo"" Cowan. Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick appointed his former chief of staff to serve as interim senator after Kerry stepped down. If he wants to stay in the Senate past next year, Markey will need to run for re-election in November 2014, when a full six-year term will be at stake. Gomez has hinted that he'll run again, and minutes after the election was called, some national Republicans already had their eyes on a rematch. ""Today marks the end of the first mile in the marathon to permanently fill the Massachusetts Senate seat. Gabriel Gomez is well prepared to win that marathon over the next 16 months,"" said Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, in a statement. Marked by nastiness . The race between Markey and Gomez was marked by its nastiness, with both candidates leveling charges of hyper-partisanship to try and sway voters in the Bay State. The back-and-forth between the two candidates spanned a laundry list of issues. Markey demanded Gomez release more of his income tax returns to shed light on a real estate transaction. Gomez suggested Markey wasn't a valid resident of Massachusetts after three decades in Washington. Gomez called Markey ""pond scum"" for airing an ad that pictured him alongside Osama bin Laden. And Markey cast doubt on Gomez's past as a private equity investor since his rival wouldn't disclose his list of clients. The sniping played out in television ads and in three debates, which featured pointed remarks from both candidates. In the final showdown, a tense moment arose when Gomez challenged Markey on term limits - a policy that would have prevented the 20-term Democrat from remaining in Washington. Markey countered by asking his Republican rival whether he'd posed the same question to longtime GOP senators like Mitch McConnell and John McCain. Gomez said he had. Markey, without explicitly accusing Gomez of lying, expressed deep skepticism. The exchange got to the heart of the Republican candidate's central takedown of Markey - that the longtime Democratic congressman's roots in Washington disqualify him as a voice for Bay State voters. ""Who are the people going to trust to put people in front of party and politics?"" Gomez asked at the start of the debate. Markey seemed to bristle at the suggestion he's been outside of Massachusetts too long, even going as far as reciting his home address in Malden where he said he's lived for more than six decades. ""The question isn't where you're coming from, it's where you're going,"" Markey said before launching into his own main takedown of his rival. ""Mr. Gomez, he's backing these tired old Republican ideas...That's a reflection of who he's going to be with down in the United States Senate.""","The election is marked by low voter turnout .
Markey beats Gomez 55%-45% .
Democrats greatly outspend Republicans in the contest .
Gomez has hinted he'll run again ."
"(CNN) -- Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank gave their updated projections on the global economy ahead of this week's G8 Summit in North Ireland. It was not pretty reading. In a nutshell, according to the World Bank, it looks like this: . Global growth is stable, but slow. It is now forecast to reach 2.2% from last year's 2.3%. The industrialized countries are barely sputtering along. The 34 countries that are members of the OECD will be just above 1% and the developing countries just over 5% this year and a hair over 5.5% through 2015. But tucked into the World Bank ""Global Economic Prospects"" report is an interesting caveat; developing country performance would be much lower without the two pillars of emerging markets and the two anchor members of the BRICS: China and India. READ MORE: Does Brazil deserve to be the 'B' in BRIC? Strip them out of the equation, according to the World Bank, and developing countries see their top line number come down to 3.6% this year -- a full 1.5% lower. That spread should be consistent through 2015, according to the forecasts. Two points were given more than their fair share of market and media coverage last week. The World Bank cut its projections from China quite severely to 7.7%, down more than 0.5%. The view was circulated that the BRICS have lost their luster; in essence their better days are far behind them. Andrew Burns, author of the World Bank report, said that investors should adjust their expectations. There will be a ""new normal for developing countries of slower growth,"" Burns suggested. However, referring to the 2008 -- 2009 global financial crisis, he said the overall environment ""will be more stable because we put behind us the very serious risks."" The past week of trading was a nasty one for emerging market countries. Their equity markets and currencies remain under pressure on fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve may alter course on its bond purchases and thereafter raise interest rates if necessary. READ MORE: Building on the BRICs . ""It is robust growth, strong growth, growth we should be happy with,"" Burns said. ""But well off the highs that we saw in the earlier part of the last decade."" Perhaps what we should be doing, however, is looking at China and India. The two countries posted their worst performances in more than a decade last year, but the weight of two and a half billion people and their demand for commodities to fuel growth (even at a slower pace) are the developing world's two pillars. Rising demand in the emerging world has led to a 17.6% increase in South-South trade for the last decade. In another major shift, half of the products made in emerging markets now goes to partners in other emerging markets. The emerging markets are less dependent on the developed world than ever before. READ MORE: China spaceship blasts off . But this is an important period of transition which is far from complete. China is trying to move away from being an economy overly dependent on exports and government investment to one that benefits from domestic-led demand. India, other strategists suggest, needs to unleash growth by cutting the size and role of government. A decade ago, after investment bank Goldman Sachs authored the BRIC acronym, these countries were lulled into thinking that commodity demand would be a one way bet that would override a need to accelerate economic reforms. READ MORE: World's most powerful leaders meet . This is evident is both Brazil and Russia, which are struggling to recover after the financial crisis. Brazil, according to the World Bank, is projected to bounce back to 2.9% this year after struggling at below 1% in 2012. Russia's growth is pegged at just 2% to 3% in 2013, despite North Sea Brent oil prices hovering at $100 a barrel for three years running. Both of these countries should be experiencing a ""halo effect"" of sorts, with two things in common. Both have landed the hosting of two global sporting events: The FIFA World Cups and Olympic Games between 2014 and 2018. They will be on the global radar for sporting fans, opening the way for substantial visitor growth. But re-energizing these economies is not that simple. Brazil is trying to contain a protest movement with many feeling alienated by the infrastructure buildout and rising cost of transport. Last autumn, Russians took to the streets again frustrated they are not seeing the fruits of middle income growth. The games may begin from 2014, but both these countries may miss the full benefits of golden opportunities to promote the next wave of growth.","The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have updated their global economic projections .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In January, President-elect Barack Obama and his family will make history, becoming the first African-American first family to move into the White House -- a house with a history of slavery. In fact, the legacy of American presidents owning slaves goes all the way back to George Washington. A wood engraving of handcuffed and shackled slaves passing the U.S. Capitol, depicts a scene circa 1819. Twelve American presidents owned slaves and eight of them, starting with Washington, owned slaves while in office. Almost from the very start, slaves were a common sight in the executive mansion. A list of construction workers building the White House in 1795 includes five slaves - named Tom, Peter, Ben, Harry and Daniel -- all put to work as carpenters. Other slaves worked as masons in the government quarries, cutting the stone for early government buildings, including the White House and U.S. Capitol. According to records kept by the White House Historical Association, slaves often worked seven days a week -- even in the hot and humid Washington summers. In 1800, John Adams was the first president to live in the White House, moving in before it was finished. Adams was a staunch opponent of slavery, and kept no slaves. Future presidents, however, didn't follow his lead. Thomas Jefferson, who succeeded Adams, wrote that slavery was an ""assemblage of horrors"" and yet he brought his slaves with him. Early presidents were expected to pay their household expenses themselves, and many who came from the so-called ""slave states"" simply brought their slaves with them. Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison, Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant all owned slaves but not during their time in office. James Madison, Jefferson's successor, held slaves all of his life including while he was in office. During the war of 1812 Madison's slaves helped remove material from the White House shortly before the British burned the building.  Michelle Obama uncovers slaves in her family » . In 1865 one of Madison's former slaves, Paul Jennings, wrote the first White House memoir: ""A Colored Man's Reminiscences of Life in the White House."" In the book, Jennings called Madison ""one of the best men that ever lived"" and said Madison ""never would strike a slave, although he had over one hundred; neither would he allow an overseer to do it."" There were other presidents who treated their slaves less kindly. James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, John Tyler, James K. Polk and Zachary Taylor all owned slaves while they were in office. The last of these, President Taylor, said owning slaves was a Constitutional right and he said slave-owners like himself would ""appeal to the sword if necessary"" to keep them. The Civil War, of course, put that opinion to the test. Now, the Obamas are moving into the White House. ""The apple cart has been turned over here when you have the Obamas -- the first African-American couple -- now actually management and you are having in some cases white Americans serving them,"" says presidential historian Doug Brinkley. Michelle Obama learned this year that one of her great-great grandfathers was a slave who worked on a rice plantation in South Carolina. She says finding that part of her past uncovered both shame and pride and what she calls the tangled history of this country. For many, the historic election on November 4 marked a new beginning. Though Michelle Obama's ancestors had to come through the ordeal of slavery, ""Her children are sleeping in the room of presidents,"" said Brinkley. ""It's a very great and hopeful sign.""","Obamas will make history as first African-American first family in White House .

"(EW) -- Happy birthday, Harry Potter! The Boy Who Lived turns 33 July 31 (age determined by Muggles That Rule The Internet), and he's probably having a pretty great day. His kids aren't yet at Hogwarts, so — if I can get a little fan fiction-y on you for a moment — he's probably just spending the day with Ginny, James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. His life is a lot easier now; not having a noseless mass murderer breathing down your neck (and in your head!) does wonders for your stress level. There's a reason J.K. Rowling focused the story on his teenage years and isn't currently writing an eighth book called ""Harry Potter the Suburban Dad."" (To be clear: If she wrote it, I would read it.) Greatest Movies of All Time: YOU Rank the Top 5! Because Harry's post-Voldemort days eventually become pretty dang easy, I got to thinking about his Hogwarts years, which were 4,224 pages strong of mountain troll-fighting, blood quill-dealing, and mysteries galore. While I'm sure even the non-Potterphiles among you are aware of his biggest accomplishments (defeating Voldemort comes to mind) there are a lot of moments where Harry was pretty bloody awesome, and it's totally been forgotten if you haven't recently done a re-read. In honor of Harry's 33rd birthday today, here are 33 moments where Harry Potter was more incredible than Felix Felicis (and all of which have nothing to do with what he's best known for: killing the Dark Lord). 1.) Forget ""The Chosen One"" — call him The Candy Man. Pre-teen Mr. Potter loaded everyone up on the Hogwarts Express. You're welcome, Ron. Chocolate Frogs free for all! 2.) Who knew a sock could be so powerful? Twelve-year-old Harry sees injustice in the world, and he did something about it, freeing Dobby from Lucius Malfoy at the end of ""Chamber of Secrets."" 3.) Pretending to give Ron the Felix Felicis is one of the most amusing/clever/kind (pick your adjectives!) friendship moments of the series. He let him think he gave him a magic liquid, and gave him confidence instead. 4.) Who among us didn't tear up when Dudley and Harry make their tentative peace in ""Deathly Hallows""? The fact that this scene didn't make the movie is a real shame. 15 Worst TV Spin-offs Ever . 5.) His kindness was on display when he took Luna to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party. 6.) He helped Luna look for her shoes after they all disappeared (Nargles, or school bullies, were behind it). 7.) He went to Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday party even though he really didn't want to. 8.) In one of his most Gryffindor-esque moments of his Hogwarts years, Harry brought Cedric's body back to give to Cedric's parents. 9.) He was the official secretary of S.P.E.W. because, while he may have given her grief, he always supported Hermione's initiatives. 10.) If you're feeling happy and would rather be crying, just remember that when Dobby died, Harry buried him himself — and he dug the grave magic-free. 11.) Harry Potter may have been moody during his fifth year, but it was also when he founded and ran Dumbledore's Army. You know, just your everyday, run-of-the-mill, anti-ministry, pro-defense training ground. 12.) He legitimately faced death pretty much every year (including basically full-time when he was 17), and he still regularly tried to save everyone. 13.) He spared Peter Pettigrew's life because he didn't think his dad's friends should be murderers, which is one of those incredible ""this is who you really are,"" character-defining moments that come around only a few times in your life. 14.) After Ron left Hermione and Harry in the forest during their outdoor trek when they're 17, Harry welcomed him back when he finally returns: No grudge-holding necessary. 15.)

The line ""No need to call me Sir, professor."" Snark! 21.) Rules were made to be broken, and Hogsmeade is not to be missed, so he regularly snuck out of the castle using the Marauder's Map. Mischief managed. 22.) The moment when Harry cast the Patronus Charm at the end of ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" but thought it was his dad = instant chills. J.K. Rowling accepts charitable donation for identity revelation . 23.) He told Cedric about the dragons in ""Goblet of Fire"" after discovering everyone knew but him because while he's a Gryffindor through and through, he's got some Hufflepuff hidden away somewhere. 24.) The most romantic Harry moment of the series had nothing to do with his first kiss with Cho Chang. Instead, while locked away in detention as Ginny clenched the Quidditch Cup, Harry realized he didn't care what Ron thought and kissed her during the victory party. 25.) Scrimgeour: ""Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a 17-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It's time you learned some respect!"" Harry: ""It's time you earned it."" Can't be forgotten: Harry's battle line in the name of Stan Shunpike is inspiring in a real-world sense. 26.) Weirdly grown-up Harry lectured Remus about responsibility and love after he found out Remus wanted to leave a pregnant Tonks. 27.) Remember that time Harry and Ginny kissed before Bill's wedding? Remember when they made out on his birthday? Constant fear of death has nothing on teenage hormones. 28.) Eleven-year-old Harry saved Hermione from a mountain troll ... and he didn't even like her that much at that point! 29.) ""Wow, I wonder what it'd be like to have a difficult life?"" Harry getting sassy, y'all. 30.) He may be occasionally frustrated by him, but (with a few first-year exceptions) he's always kind to Neville. 31.) ""Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher.

"(CNN) -- Remember when Lindsay Lohan was the next Ann-Margret? Or Elizabeth Taylor? Or even Marilyn Monroe? While that last comparison is still being bandied about -- for better or for worse -- today there is more buzz about ""will she stay clean?"" and ""can she stay out of trouble?"" than her talent. Lohan's latest 90-day rehab stint, which ended this week, was taken as an alternative to three months of jail time for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in March. Lindsay Lohan the actress seems to have been replaced by Lindsay Lohan the perpetual comeback kid. And although she has continued to work sporadically, those roles have mostly been of troubled women, not unlike Lohan herself. ""At this point, we're not even sure she's still an actress,"" said Noah Levy, co-host of Vh1's ""The Gossip Table."" ""Can Lindsay get sober and have a healthy and happy life? Of course she can. But can she be believable as a character that is not like herself? I don't know."" In ""The Canyons,"" the new film written by Bret Easton Ellis (""American Psycho"") and directed by Paul Schrader (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull""), Lohan plays Tara, a woman who has a lot going on -- not least of which is that her boyfriend (played by porn star James Deen) likes to invite other men and women home to have sex with them. The low-budget film had difficulties finding a distributor, and The New York Times documented Lohan's on-set antics, which nearly got her fired from the film before shooting even began. ""The Canyons"" is set to be released this week via video on demand, and it has been savaged by critics for both the film and Lohan's acting. ""Lohan's performance is certainly terrible, but her steady slide started long ago,"" wrote IndieWire's Eric Kohn. "" 'The Canyons' has nothing on the awesomely horrendous 2007 'I Know Who Killed Me,' a ultra-campy fusion of art house and crime movie tropes that fell apart in several directions at once."" Before that, Lohan made critics' hit list for her turn as Elizabeth Taylor in the made-for-television movie ""Liz & Dick,"" about the late actress' love affair with Richard Burton. ""Lohan, who has squandered years of promise and talent as a sullen-faced party girl and irregular arrestee, has been cut so many breaks, it's difficult to root for her anymore,"" Ken Tucker wrote in Entertainment Weekly. While Lohan is reportedly doing well post-rehab, her biggest projects don't quite reflect the work of someone who was once on track to become the greatest actress of her generation. Instead, Lohan is slated to open up to talk show queen Oprah Winfrey while also appearing on an eight part docu-series chronicling her comeback. She's also guest-hosting for Chelsea Handler on ""Chelsea Lately."" Lohan can't even lay claim anymore to the title of Hollywood's most troubled ingenue, as that role has now been filled by Amanda Bynes. So where does that leave her? Schrader wrote in an essay for Film Comment that he believes Lohan and the late Marilyn Monroe have a lot in common. ""I think Lohan has more natural acting talent than Monroe did, but, like Monroe, her weakness is her inability to fake it,"" he wrote. ""She feels she must be experiencing an emotion in order to play it. This leads to all sorts of emotional turmoil, not to mention on-set delays and melodrama. ""We call them ""troubled,"" ""tormented,"" ""train wrecks"" -- but we can't turn away. We can't stop watching. They get under our skin in a way that controlled performers can't."" Her father, Michael Lohan, recently told E! News he believes his daughter will be ""another Robert Downey Jr.,"" referencing the Academy Award-nominated actor who famously turned around his life and career after several arrests and rehabs. ""I'm very, very proud of what she's accomplished, how far she's come and how seriously she's taking her sobriety and her future,"" he said. So we'll watch. And we'll wait. But Lohan has been here before. In 2012, a highly publicized guest appearance on ""Glee"" and shots of the actress dining with iconic director Woody Allen led to speculation that Lohan was on her way to a career resurgence. Then there was chatter that the actress was ""a diva"" on the ""Glee"" set, and nothing appeared to come of the chats with Allen. One year later, Lohan was back in rehab. All the public can count on is that Lohan is willing to take any shot given to her. ""She is great at making attempts at a comeback,"" Levy said. ""Is she great at having career longevity? The jury is still out.""","Lindsay Lohan has new projects coming up, but critics savage new movie .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Higgs humor has humbled me. I thought I'd nailed it, when I wrote what could be the first original Higgs Boson joke ever here. But since this week's announcement that the Higgs particle has been found, there's been a wave of Higgs humor on Twitter, a lot of it curated by Boing Boing's Xeni Jardin, whose battle with breast cancer led her to tweet: ""Gonna start calling my post-mastectomy, science-rebuilt cyberboob the ""Higgs Bosom."" To be funny about something you usually have to understand it well. But sometimes it's the difficulty of understanding something that makes it funny. From @pourmecoffee: ""Higgs Boson Explainer: It's like, a particle, man."" Science writer @edyong209 tweets: ""A Higgs boson walks into a bar. The barman doesn't understand."" And ""Re: CERN, some ppl say it's silly to put so much money in something few people understand. Presumably those ppl also avoid banks."" @scullymike tweets: ""There's an easy-to-understand video online that explains Higgs boson & creation of the universe, but it's like four minutes long. Pass."" Turns out Mike Scully's a ringer -- he used to write for The Simpsons and much more. The humor can get a little deeper once we understand that the Higgs particle is responsible for all things having mass. From the astrophysicist with the mass following @neiltyson: ""The Higgs discovery makes me feel heavier already."" He adds: ""What we need instead is the anti-Higgs. A particle that takes mass away."" Two punchlines in one tweet. DeGrasse Tyson! This one from from a joke written by @sciencecomedian, is making the meme rounds big time: ""The Higgs Boson walks into a Catholic Church. Priest says ""What are you doing here?"" HB says ""You can't have mass without me."" For a little more context, read The New York Times' @doverbye who, best I can tell, has never tweeted so I had to read the whole article where he writes that without Higgs ""all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight."" In other words, without Higgs, all life would be like a tough day of parenting. My favorite Higgs Humor on Twitter comes from a guy who dared challenge the rule of never telling more than 3 jokes on a single subject. @afrakt tapped into the public exhuberance over the Higgs discovery: ""Wow! People going crazy for Higgs. Huge parade down Main St. Fireworks tonight!"" And then: ""Oh come on! McDonald's to offer 1800 caolorie Higgs McBoson. Blames physics for obestity epidemic."" And ""Republicans rail against the Higgs boson as the largest taxing of Americans' brains in history."" I figured anyone who can do a Higgs Hat Trick could be worth talking to. So I tracked down @afrakt, aka Austin Frakt, Assistant Professor of Economics at Boston University with a specialty in Health Care policy. Frakt got his undergrad degree in physics from Cornell and his Ph.D. from MIT in statistical signal and image processing which, he explains, means ""how to make sense of streams of data using statistics and applied mathematics."" But ""public policy was always in my blood,"" he tells me. So Frakt has been applying the scientific method to health care. I sense an opportunity. We Americans don't have a single-payer health care system. We have so many health plans to choose from. It's overwhelming. Have you, Professor Frakt, been able to game the health insurance system and, if so, can you tell our CNN audience how? ""I used to choose my health plan based on word of mouth from colleagues,"" he confesses to me. ""Last year, I decided I really should put my money where my mouth is and pick a plan more rationally."" Here's the short version. ""The plans are different in dozens of dimensions,"" says Frakt. ""I'd have to go through all my health records, which doctors did I see, how much did I pay, what were the co-pays, which drugs did we use, did I have to take my kids to the emergency room.... "" He'd have to assess all of it in light of what he predicted his family's health care needs would be in the coming year. And to top it off -- ""I would have to do all that by hand."" Why? Because there is no comprehensive unified system of health records in the U.S. And so, Professor Frakt reveals: ""I couldn't even take step one with this process. No way could I amass all the key information in a reasonable amount of time."" Which got Frakt thinking about Higgs again. Maybe, he thought out loud, we need a piece of technology that doesn't exist to solve the problem of choosing a health plan. Just as the world's great physicists created the multi-billion dollar Great Hadron Collider to smash particles until Higgs was revealed. Maybe, says Frakt, ""we need a pretty big tool."" Professor Frakt could be on to something. A Great Collider for crunching the costs and benefits of our health care plans. The power of imagination -- applied to one of society's great challenges. And that's how you develop a big idea from a few little tweets. Postscript: After this piece first posted, @sciencecomedian, aka Brian.Malow, sent us the video of him performing his 'Higgs walks into a Church' joke. The year was 2009. The joke is 16:30 into the video. But it's best to listen to his whole riff, which begins around 13:00. Laughing and Learning.","New particle fits description of elusive Higgs boson, scientists say .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India has eliminated American aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Lockheed Martin from contention for a $10 billion contract to supply new-generation combat planes to the South Asian nation. Indian Defense Ministry spokesman Sitanshu Kar told CNN that multinational Eurofighter and France's Dassault Aviation remain in the competition for the big military deal. ""Boeing and Lockheed have been eliminated in the elimination round (of the bidding),"" Kar said. The process to acquire advanced fighter jets may be completed by the end of the current fiscal year, he added. The move came barely five months after U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to India. Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Ambassador to India Timothy Roemer announced his decision to quit the post in June for what an embassy statement called ""personal, professional and family considerations."" Hours later, Roemer expressed his disappointment at India's rejection of U.S. firms for what is believed to be one of the largest fighter-jet contracts. ""We are reviewing the documents received from the government of India and are respectful of the procurement process. ""We are, however, deeply disappointed by this news. We look forward to continuing to grow and develop our defense partnership with India and remain convinced that the United States offers our defense partners around the globe the world's most advanced and reliable technology,"" he said in his second statement of the day. India and the United States signed a new framework for their defense relationship in 2005 that also covered trade and technology transfer and collaboration to boost military ties. In recent years, India has procured defense equipment worth about $4 billion from the United States, including C130J aircraft and P8I maritime surveillance aircraft, according to information posted on the website of the External Affairs Ministry. Ties between the two nations have warmed over the past decade, especially after President Bill Clinton's visit to India in March 2000. A landmark civil nuclear cooperation deal that New Delhi and Washington agreed to later during the George W. Bush presidency took the relationship to new heights as it ended energy-hungry, but rapidly-growing India's decades-old nuclear isolation. India has been placed high on Obama's goal list to build what he called a ""defining"" partnership.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced on Thursday that he will nominate John Koskinen, a veteran of both public service and the private sector, to take over the embattled Internal Revenue Service. A blog post on the White House website described Koskinen, who recently turned 74, as ""a retired corporate restructuring expert"" who would become commissioner of the IRS upon confirmation by the Senate. The tax collection agency of 90,000 employees currently is headed by a temporary leader, Daniel Werfel, who was appointed by Obama in May in the aftermath of revelations that some groups seeking tax-exempt status were targeted for extra scrutiny based on political labels such as ""tea party."" Republicans have claimed the targeting amounts to political attacks on government enemies, but investigators have so far found no evidence of political motivation or involvement from outside the IRS. If confirmed, Koskinen will face continuing investigation of the targeting by Justice Department, the Treasury inspector general's office and House Republicans, as well as GOP efforts to undermine Obama's health care law which will be administered in large part by the IRS. ""John is an expert at turning around institutions in need of reform,"" Obama said in a statement, adding that ""every part of our government must operate with absolute integrity and that is especially true for the IRS. I am confident that John will do whatever it takes to restore the public's trust in the agency."" Koskinen previously was acting chief executive officer of Freddie Mac, the federal mortgage agency, and was a deputy mayor of Washington D.C. as well as deputy director of management at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget after a business career with the Palmieri Co. In the Clinton administration, he was deputy director for management of the budget office and then oversaw efforts to manage the millennium conversion that occurred at the end of the year 2000. He also has been a major figure in U.S. soccer, serving as vice chairman of the American Professional Soccer League and president of the United States Soccer Foundation.","John Koskinen is a veteran of both public service and the private sector .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A judge dismissed all charges Wednesday against six police officers and a former officer who'd been accused of shooting unarmed civilians, two of them fatally, at a New Orleans bridge days after Hurricane Katrina. In dismissing the charges, Criminal District Judge Raymond Bigelow said three of the defendants were forced to testify before the grand jury that went on to indict them and the other four. State law says that ""no testimony or other information compelled under the order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information, may be used against the witness in any criminal case,"" the judge noted. The judge said he reached ""the inescapable conclusion that the state improperly used the testimony of these officers to indict them as well as the others."" He also cited testimony in which a police lieutenant said he had been shown one of the defendant's grand jury testimony. The state plans to appeal, the clerk of the court said. The shootings of September 4, 2005, the Sunday after Hurricane Katrina struck, killed two men and wounded four other people who were were trying to evacuate by crossing the Danziger Bridge over the Industrial Canal. The officers had gone to the bridge because of reports that rescue workers heard gunfire and an officer had been wounded. Police said officers shot only after being shot at, though some evidence contradicted that assertion. Killed were Ronald Madison, 40, and James Brissette, 19. Bigelow threw out indictments against Sgts. Kenneth Bowen and Robert Gisevius Jr., Officer Anthony Villavaso II and former Officer Robert Faulcon Jr., who were facing first-degree murder and attempted murder charges.

"(CNN) -- The night that ended with Cherish Perrywinkle's disappearance started with a generous offer at the dollar store. Investigators said a man met the 8-year-old's mother at a Dollar General in Jacksonville, Florida, Friday evening. He told her that the family looked like they were down on their luck and that he wanted to take them to Walmart and buy them new clothes. Hours later, the mom called 911. Her daughter was missing. The mother and her three children had spent hours shopping at Walmart with the man when he offered to buy hamburgers at the store's McDonald's, according to Michael Williams, director of investigations and homeland security for the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. The man set off toward the front of the store with Cherish. That, Williams told reporters, is when something went horribly wrong. ""They walked to the front of the Walmart toward the McDonald's. They did not stop at the McDonald's,"" he said. ""They walked outside, got in his van and left."" On Saturday morning, investigators found Cherish's lifeless body in a wooded area near a church 4 miles away. Authorities accuse the man who offered to buy her family clothes at Walmart, Donald James Smith, with kidnapping and killing her. He was arrested Saturday morning after an officer spotted his van driving on a local highway. Suspect appears in court . Smith, 56, pleaded not guilty when he appeared in court on Sunday, CNN affiliate WAWS reported. He is being held without bond. It was not immediately clear whether Smith has a lawyer. Smith is a registered sex offender who was released from custody less than a month ago, Williams said. Authorities from the sheriff's office had just made contact with him to verify his address on Friday morning. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, Smith has a lengthy criminal record that includes crimes involving children. He was most recently convicted of impersonating a public employee and aggravated child abuse by willful torture. Court records show he was sentenced to a year in the county jail and was released on May 31. Investigators have not released information about how Cherish died or what they believe Smith was doing from the point of the abduction until his arrest. Her mother, Rayne Perrywinkle, hasn't spoken publicly about what happened Friday night, and she declined to discuss the case with WAWS on Sunday. Cherish's father, Billy James Jarreau, issued a statement Saturday through his attorney thanking law enforcement for their investigation and the public for their condolences. ""Mr. Jarreau hopes that his daughter's death sheds light on the dangers of allowing dangerous pedophiles to remain in our community,"" said the statement from attorney Gerald Wilkerson. Williams told reporters that investigators had used all the resources they could to find the child. He said the tragic case offered a sobering reminder. ""Pay attention to your surroundings,"" he said. ""Pay attention to who you meet, who you give access to your children."" A devastated community . A makeshift memorial of flowers, balloons, cards and stuffed animals has piled up in front of the church near the area where Cherish was found over the weekend, WAWS reported. Devastated friends left hand-written notes. Kendall Cabanda, an elementary school classmate, cried as she told WAWS about how much fun she had riding the bus with Cherish. ""We talked about stuff like TV shows, like girly things about dolls and fairies,"" Cabanda said, ""about stuff that is imaginary."" On Sunday, hundreds attended a candlelight vigil to honor Cherish, whom friends described as a vibrant girl who liked to play dress up and loved to sing. At the vigil, her 5-year-old sister sang ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" for her.","Donald James Smith has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and murder charges .

"(CNN) -- South Korea's Inbee Park says she will consider it a grand slam if she wins next month's British Open. A day after becoming the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the first three majors of the season, Park is not concerned by the presence of five women's majors this year. ""Yes, of course, I think so,"" Sunday's U.S. Women's Open winner told CNN World Sport when asked if success at the British Open would constitute a grand slam. ""Even though there are five majors, I think winning four is very, very good."" This is the first year in which there will be five majors on the schedule, after the Evian Championship in France was elevated in status. By winning at the Sebonack course in Southampton by four strokes, the World No. 1 put herself in contention to become the first golfer -- male or female -- to win four major championships in a season. Having won the Kraft Nabisco Championship in April and the Wegmans LPGA Championship earlier this month, she has already matched the record of the legendary Babe Zaharias, who won three majors in 1950. When Zaharias achieved her milestone only three majors were on the schedule, while Mickey Wright (1961) and Pat Bradley (1986) are the only other players in LPGA history to win three majors in a season -- but the latter two women failed to achieve consecutive wins. Park, 24, says she was well aware of the history coming her way as she drove off on Sunday. ""I felt the pressure because I was going for three in a row and everything that was going on was very crazy -- but once I got on the course, I was very calm,"" she said. ""It's crazy what I've just done. I never would have thought I would have done that ever. ""I am achieving things I never thought I would get, but I am getting there one step at a time. I don't know how far I will go."" Winning a fifth major in the season, with the Evian Championship taking place in September, would represent a milestone in the history of golf. Although an arguably slim prospect, Park's record in her last 24 starts -- with eight victories coming on top of five runner-up finishes -- suggests she is likely to be in contention at both events. The Seoul-born golfer won her first major in 2008 at the U.S. Women's Open but had to wait until earlier this year to add that success. South Koreans have won seven of the last nine major LPGA titles and Park is hopeful she can continue that remarkable run at St Andrews in August. ""I played very well at the British Open in the last couple of years so I am really looking forward to going there,"" added a woman who turned professional in 2006.","Inbee Park believes fourth major would constitute a 'grand slam'

"(CNN) -- New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez stayed silent and out of sight on Monday while investigators, some wearing waders, searched a wooded ravine as they continued their probe into the death of a man whose body was found less than a mile from his home. But he got a haircut. A man who identified himself as Hernandez's barber, Robby Olivares, showed up at the player's home Monday evening and told CNN he gave his famous client a haircut. ""Beautiful! He's feeling good, he has a beautiful wife, he's in good spirits,"" Olivares said after spending time with Hernandez. Police continued to sift through woods for clues that could shed some light on what happened to Odin Lloyd, 27, who a week ago was found dead less than a mile from Hernandez's expansive home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Detectives search Patriots player's house again . For the first time since last week, Hernandez's lawyer broke his silence Monday, saying his client has been subjected to ""a relentless flood of rumors, misinformation and false reports,"" including unsubstantiated accounts in some media outlets late last week that an arrest warrant had been issued in connection with the investigation. CNN did not report that a warrant had been issued, and a law enforcement source told CNN Monday, ""there is no arrest warrant. It wasn't true last week and it isn't true today."" Investigators working in woods near Hernandez's home would not respond to questions Monday about what they were looking for or its possible significance to the probe. Authorities have been tight-lipped since Lloyd's body was found. On Tuesday, a notice posted at the courthouse said all records relating to the investigation have been ""impounded by order of the court."" The move seals all records related to the case, including search warrants. Hernandez mum as probe continues . Three search warrants were issued in the case, according to the clerk of the Attleboro District Court, Mark Sturdy, but neither the warrants nor the results of any searches have been made public. Hernandez has yet to say anything publicly. A statement from his lawyer last week acknowledged there was an investigation but didn't confirm media reports that authorities had questioned his client. Lloyd died of a gunshot wound, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said Thursday. Lloyd's sister, Olivia Thibou, told CNN that Lloyd and Hernandez were friends who were at a Boston nightclub together a few days before Lloyd's death. She said her brother was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. She did not know when or how her brother and Hernandez met. Thibou said she did not know of any problems between Hernandez and Lloyd, who worked for a landscaping company. She said she couldn't imagine why anyone would want to kill her brother, whom she described as a friendly guy who was like a father to her 7-year-old daughter. In one development of sorts Monday, Hernandez's attorney and District Attorney Sam Sutter traded compliments. Michael K. Fee's statement regarding the ""flood of rumors, misinformation and false reports"" about his client praised Sutter's office, saying, ""None of these false reports came from official sources and we appreciated the professionalism and restraint shown by the Bristol County District Attorney's Office to date with regard to its public statements while its investigation is under way."" Sutter, in turn, released a brief statement Monday night saying, ""Those of us who are involved in this ongoing investigation appreciate the positive remarks about our professionalism.""","NEW: All records in the investigation have been sealed .

"(CNN) -- The eyes of the world are upon Nelson Mandela, the ailing former South African president and vanguard of human rights who was reported in critical condition Sunday evening. But for daughter Makaziwe Mandela, this is not a global event but a deeply personal and precious time for a daughter with her beloved father. ""All we do every day is take one day at a time and pray to the good Lord,"" Makaziwe told CNN's Robyn Curnow. She said her father was at peace, and the family hoped for a peaceful transition into the spiritual realm. ""All I pray for as a daughter is that the transition is smooth. ... He is at peace with himself. He has given so much to the world. I believe he is at peace."" Nelson Mandela reported in critical condition . Some of that peace eludes the family, however, as they deal with the intense media spotlight. ""With all of this media frenzy, the camping in the hospital, you know people talking about things they don't know or understand basically. Other people want to lecture us on how we should behave, what we should do. ""Really? It's our dad. It's the children's grandfather. We've never had him in our life for better part of our years. This is in a sense quality and sacred time for us, and I would expect the world to really back off and leave us alone . ""Nelson Mandela's blood runs through these veins. Our veins. Give us the space to be with our father. Whether these are the last moments with us to be with our dad or there is still a longer. But they must back off."" Before it was announced that her father was in critical condition, Makaziwe spoke to his medical condition and state of mind.

"PORT ALLEN, Louisiana (CNN) -- Sixteen-year-old Tanya Simon is trying to keep spirits up inside the hall that has become home to families fleeing Hurricane Gustav. Tanya Simon, 16, said she sometimes feels scared in the Port Allen, Louisiana, shelter. She brought two hair weaves with her from New Orleans and is passing the time by styling them and trying to reach friends on her cell phone. But she's struggling even to keep her own nerves at bay. ""You're not at home in a place like this. You look around, and you don't know the background of the people looking at you,"" she said, adding that she felt a little scared. The community center smells, and there aren't enough cots for the 80 or so people seeking shelter there in Port Allen, Louisiana, just across the Mississippi from Baton Rouge. Tanya Simon is one of 18 members of her extended family who piled into a truck borrowed from a friend to get out before the storm hit. Her cousin Detrice Simon, 15, sits on a Superman sleeping bag, wrapped in a Spider-Man blanket, occasionally reaching out to grab and quiet one of her three nephews. She had been trying to read a well-thumbed leather-bound Bible but had given up. ""I don't have the patience any more."" The family is safe, far safer than three years ago, when floodwaters from Hurricane Katrina had them trapped in their third-floor apartment for three days. iReport.com: Your Gustav stories . In 2005, the family shared a dwindling food supply with neighbors as they waited to be rescued, said 18-year-old Terrence Cargo, another cousin. ""We thought everybody was going to die,"" he recalled. Now, American Red Cross staff members and volunteers are making sure the evacuees are getting three meals a day and snacks too, but it seems to be only temporary comfort. ""We're so far from home; we have no money; we have no food. The money is running out. I'm not even sure if we have any left,"" said Deandra Simon, Detrice's sister. Just getting out of New Orleans took a big bite out of their resources when they stopped at a gas station, the 22-year-old motel housekeeper said. ""Watching how expensive it got, the more we filled up the tank, I gotta tell you, that scared me."" It's the stories and fears of women like Deandra Simon -- whose three sons, aged 1, 2 and 6, are with her -- that really get to Jean Cappuchi. Cappuchi, a registered nurse from New Hampshire, had volunteered in the aftermath of Katrina and booked a flight back to Louisiana as Gustav approached. ""It breaks my heart, these little ones. Their mothers are so stressed out, they're crying,"" Cappuchi said. ""They don't know if they're going to be able to put food on their table. When they return home, if they have a home to return to."" Cappuchi has mostly dealt with people crying and having panic attacks. ""We have learned a lot from Katrina, but in these shelters, we are going to have chaos. There's always chaos."" Outside, Douglas Patterson, 54, and his friend James McDaniel, 42, played dominoes with two National Guardsmen as the winds began howling. ""Here it comes,"" Patterson said, shaking his head. ""Damn, it sounds like something, don't it?"" Patterson said he worked in construction as a waterproofer. ""I wish could stop this water,"" the New Orleans native said. Watching the game, Chester Reeder also kept one eye on his children as they played hide-and-seek behind two steel water tanks in the old one-room gymnasium. They had spent 11 hours on the road, forced to detour through Mississippi to get to Baton Rouge. Just the cost of gas was bad enough on a welder's budget, but Reeder plans to stay in New Orleans no matter how many storms hit. ""That's home,"" he said. But he wonders whether his city has the strength to keep standing. ""Sooner or later, God is gonna wipe New Orleans off the map for all the murdering and thieving and no-good behavior people have been doing since Katrina,"" he said. ""That man keeps giving us warnings in the form of hurricanes.""","""You're not at home in a place like this,"" says one woman in shelter .

"(CNN) -- The women's draw for this year's Wimbledon Championships are out and there are some talented players that could take the title over the next fortnight. Whether you're lucky enough to score tickets to the event or you're watching from home, here are five athletes look out for on the court. Serena Williams . The leading lady of tennis is currently on a 31 match winning streak that shows no sign of stopping. The biggest favorite to win the title, Serena Williams has already triumphed at Wimbledon five times since 2002. Some commentators have dubbed her the best player of her generation regardless of gender, and another win at Wimbledon would tie her for major titles with men's record-holder Roger Federer. Petra Kvitova . The Czech player claimed the top trophy at the All England Club in 2011, but has been on a downward spiral since. However, she is one of the few women who can challenge Serena Williams when it comes to sheer physical strength and stamina. Her playing style is well suited to grass, and if she regains her confidence Kvitova could go all the way. Interactive: 50 years of women in space . Maria Sharapova . Maria Sharapova lost to Serena Williams in the final of the 2012 Olympic Games, but the Russian player's focus on the court makes her one of the toughest opponents in the game. The third best player in the world is fearlessly aggressive, with good defense skills and stellar speed. With her precision shots from sharp angles, Sharapova is able to overpower her opponents and keep them running across the court. Laura Robson . Laura Robson first exploded on the tennis scene when she won the junior Wimbledon title aged 14 in 2008. The British player is currently the only teenager in the top 50, but she displays confidence and maturity on the court that go beyond her years. Robson partnered Andy Murray to win the silver medal in the Mixed Doubles at the London Olympics, and she has also recently stared working with Murray's former coach Miles Maclagan. Her dominant serve gives her an edge, and makes her game electrifying. Sloane Stephens . The rising star of tennis, Sloane Stephens only started playing seriously when she was nine years old, a relatively late age for professional players. However, her powerful baseline forehand has earned her legions of fans, and the 20 -year old stunned Serena Williams by beating her at the Australian Open last year. The American plays an all rounded game suited to any surface, and one of her strongest assets is her exceptional athleticism.","Serena Williams is a hot favorite to win this year's Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- As Portugal battles to repay its bailout, one of the country's airline executives has warned of the dangers of uncertainty in a region desperate to regain its economic footing. The concerns of Fernando Pinto, chief executive officer of TAP Air Portugal, are being voiced as Portugal's economic conditions remain fragile, with one OECD economist saying the country's pain is ""not over yet."" Pinto told CNN people need to ""trust in an airline the same way that they trust in the area where we operate, and Europe is very important."" Read more: Deputy PM: Turkey 'inspiration' for Islam and democracy . Pinto pointed to the panicked Cyprus bailout as an example of the uncertainty undermining Europe's recovery. ""Things like what happened in Cyprus really concern us,"" he said. Constant quarrelling between debt-ridden nations and creditors has destabilized Europe, and this month the eye of the debt crisis focused on Portugal.

Last week, finance ministers of the single currency area agreed to give Portugal and Ireland seven more years to repay their bailout loans. Portugal's government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho, is struggling to plug a 1.3 billion euro ($1.7 billion) gap in public finances after the country's constitutional court rejected further cuts to state pensions and public sector wages, amounting to 0.8% of the Portugal's output.

Jens Arnold, a senior economist on Portugal at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, told CNN that the country was on track with its austerity program but risks of political instability and stagnating growth remained. ""We see no risk of default or of leaving the eurozone. Our impression is that Portugal is making substantial progress,"" Arnold said. ""Investor confidence is improving,"" he added. The government has, as part of its drive to balance the books, investigated plans to privatize TAP Air Portugal. However last year's talks stalled after the sole bidder, Brazil-based Synergy Aerospace, failed to provide financial guarantees, according to the Portuguese Treasury. In 2012, the Lisbon-based airline had net profit of 15.9 million euros as the company increased its number of passengers and at reduced its total debt by 21% Pinto said. ""To survive these days, you have to be careful with costs and we are number one in costs,"" Pinto said. Regulatory red tape, however, is a source of frustration for Pinto. The European Commission's long-held plans for a ""Single European Sky"" have been ""very slow,"" according to the chief executive. ""We've been over-regulated,"" he added. Although European airlines benefit from operating in a free market, they are feeling ""unloved"" by regulators in contrast to other markets where aviation is central to driving economic growth, according to Graham Dunn, managing editor of Airline Business. He told CNN that high tax burdens and a crunch in future airport capacity are to blame for the tough growth climate for European airlines. Domestically, Pinto said Portugal's unemployment is TAP's ""biggest concern."" He added: ""We are one of the biggest employers but of course as I said we depend on the economy here."" The southern European country is grappling with unemployment at 17.5% while the economy is forecast to contract by 1.9% for 2013, according to Europe's statistics office Eurostat. According to Arnold, unemployment ""is very high and will probably remain high over this and the next year."" For Portugal, he said, ""the worst -- in terms of the social cost of the adjustment -- is unfortunately not over yet.""","One of Portugal's airline executives has warned of the dangers of uncertainty in Europe .

"(CNN) -- As Stacey Halstead looked down at her 2-year-old son, Tripp, lying unconscious in a hospital bed, she was mesmerized by how angelic he seemed. He was not bleeding. No cuts or bruises. He was perfect. You would not know that a tree limb had crushed his skull just hours earlier. That morning, Halstead dropped Tripp off at his day care in Winder, Georgia. It was a relatively warm autumn day, and he was playing in the shade of a tree in front of the day care when a large branch fell on his head. See also: 10 common kid health emergencies and what to do . Halstead was working in Snellville, less than an hour away, when she got a call from the day care, Cribs to Crayons, that Tripp had an accident. ""I didn't think much of it,"" Halstead recalled. She told her co-workers she would be back in a few hours. But as she was en route to the day care, she got another call that Tripp was being transported to the hospital. ""At that point I thought he had a broken arm or had a broken leg,"" Halstad reflected. When she finally reached the hospital, Barrow Regional Medical Center, authorities were prepping Tripp to be airlifted to Atlanta. Stacey and her husband, Bill, drove more than an hour to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston to meet Tripp. There, doctors told the desperate couple that their son was going to need immediate brain surgery and braced them for the fact that he might not live through the operation. Doctors removed parts of Tripp's skull in order to operate on frontal and parietal lobes of his brain, areas that control thinking, personality and motor functions. But they found that parts of his brain were severely damaged by the blunt trauma, according to Dr. Joshua Chern, a pediatric neurosurgeon who performed the first brain surgery on Tripp when he came to Children's Healthcare. Despite the odds, Tripp did not die. That warm autumn day, October 29, would be the start of the Halsteads' journey toward their son's recovery, which would span months of medical complications, numerous surgeries and countless rehabilitation sessions. Soon, Halstead found herself living at Children's Healthcare, watching over Trippdoodle, her favorite nickname for her son. She'd watch his chest rise and fall as he remained in an induced coma for days on end. It was a stark difference from the daring 2-year-old she had to keep an eye on a month before as he ventured up and down a water slide during a family cruise vacation. She felt helpless, but there was no one to blame. The police report cited the incident as an accident, and the tree with the branch that crushed Tripp's skull wasn't even on the day care's property. She was at a loss, especially as she found herself explaining over and over on the phone to relatives and friends about what happened to her only child. Desperate and in search of solace, Halstead turned to Facebook. She started posting news and sharing her thoughts on the page Tripp Halstead Updates, which was created to keep family members in the loop about Tripp's health after the accident. She chronicled it all as she sat beside Tripp's hospital bed: his daily vomiting, the restless nights, her bouts of fear. In between those posts, she shared photos of Tripp before the accident. A magnetic smile stretches across the toddler's face as he rides his red tricycle, poses proudly in his tiny suit and splashes in a pool. They're chilling comparisons to the expressionless boy lying in a hospital bed. She didn't hold back details, but she tried to remain hopeful. ""Tripp had a pretty good evening. He threw up a few times, so we still can't find a pattern. So frustrating, but we are not giving up,"" she wrote in one of her posts. Blogging about Tripp's progress became a form of therapy for her. ""You have meltdowns and you have days where you cry and are depressed, but you get on there, and you see all these people who are supportive,"" she said. ""And all the stories people share of their kids getting poor prognoses from doctors that they are going to be vegetables, but then they pull through. Those stories are really great."" Over time, Halstead's posts about her son's accident and recovery found a mass audience. Within a few months, the Tripp Halstead Updates Facebook page gained more than 700,000 followers. Parents shared hopeful tales about their children persevering over ailments despite the greatest of odds. ""It has been a blessing. It's what keeps me sane,"" Halstead said. An Ironman family's race to help . One of those people who found Tripp's Facebook page was Kaete Nazaroff, who began following his journey in March. She didn't know Tripp personally, but as the New York resident stared at his small face on her laptop screen, she knew he was in pain. Tripp's story reminded Nazaroff of her own son. ""I have a 2-year-old boy who is blond and precious just like Tripp's 'before' photos,"" she said. At the time, Halstead was uploading photos of her son, unconscious and hooked up to all sorts of tubes after undergoing surgery to get rid of a bacterial infection that took root near his brain. It was an emotional step back after Tripp was starting to make progress in rehabilitation. The juxtaposition between the images of Tripp hooked up to colorful tubes and wires and the nostalgic photos of the carefree toddler before the accident stayed with Nazaroff, even after she turned off her computer. A week went by, and the mother of two still could not get Tripp's story out of her mind. ""I was thinking this could be any of us,"" said Nazaroff, who as a child cared for a mother with multiple sclerosis. ""I know what it's like to be caring for someone who is sick and you can't do anything about it."" So she began brainstorming ways to help. She turned to her husband, Dave, the owner of three bike shops in New York and a seven-time Ironman triathlete. Nazaroff asked him how long it would take to ride his bike from Nyack, New York, to Atlanta. She reasoned that they could do something to raise money for Tripp and his family. ""They weren't asking for donations, but my heart connected to Tripp's anguish,"" she said. ""I didn't have a lot of money of my own that my family could spare, but I knew (we could) raise money for them."" The couple decided to make the bike-riding fundraiser a reality for Tripp and his family. They set a date, June 26, when Dave Nazaroff would begin riding his bike nearly 900 miles from New York to Atlanta over five days. When Nazaroff contacted the Halsteads about the plan, they were slightly stunned by the idea. ""We got the e-mail from Kaete about what they wanted to do -- her husband riding 900 miles -- we were like, 'Wow, that's kind of crazy,' "" Bill Halstead recalled. Dave Nazaroff agrees that 900 miles is a hefty distance. ""I've ridden my bike pretty far but never the distance that I am going to do for this trip,"" he explained. He says doing it for someone else makes the goal seem possible. ""You are motivated when doing an Ironman, but it is for yourself. In this case, it is for Tripp and for his family,"" he said. As her husband trained for the ride, Nazaroff worked on building momentum for the cycling event. She started a fundraiser called Toga Multisport RIDE to GIVE Benefitting Tripp Halstead and received donations from people online. In hopes of reaching a wider audience, she sent in a CNN iReport about Dave's bike ride on March 16. The story now has nearly 60,000 views, and they've collected more than $105,000. All she wants, Nazaroff explained, is to raise enough money so that Halstead can continue being by Tripp's side. A Tripp that changes lives . Now that Tripp is back home after spending more than five months in the hospital, Halstead -- who hasn't gone back to work since the accident -- spends most of her time caring for him and writing about the baby steps Tripp is making in his recovery. Months ago, he couldn't speak, but now he is starting to moan, she reported. ""And when you say, 'Tripp, look at Mommy,' he looks at you after a 20-second delay,"" Halstead said. It's progress, considering there was a time when Tripp's eyes couldn't focus. He has limited mobility and has to be pushed around in a little wheelchair. ""But in rehab, he will move his toes when you tell him to lift his legs,"" she said. ""You can tell he is really trying."" At the end of the day, Tripp's parents say, who he is now and who he was before are simply not comparable. They want what any parent in their situation wants: for their son to ultimately make a full recovery and live a normal life. But right now, just scrunching his nose or wiggling his toes is considered a big success. Deaf toddler hears first words . Although she still blogs regularly about Tripp, Halstead is no longer spending every moment at his bedside. The couple goes on walks with Tripp in his wheelchair, attends charity events for their son and have guests over for play dates. It's all a part of putting their life back together and sharing those stories with the followers and friends they have found online. Friends like Nazaroff, whose charity for Tripp transformed her from a stay-at-home mom to a philanthropist. ""Working on this charity, I feel like I found myself and I feel like I am making a positive change,"" she said. As Dave Nazaroff's ride to Atlanta draws near, she hopes other people will also follow the story of Tripp, his family and the work everyone has put into seeing this bike ride happen. ""It's more than just a story about a little boy. It's also a story of strangers helping strangers,"" she said.","On October 29, 2-year-old Tripp Halstead was severely injured at his day care in Georgia .

"New York (CNN) -- A blogger has posted the home addresses of staffers from a newspaper after the paper published an online, interactive map showing names and addresses of all handgun permit-holders in New York's Westchester and Rockland counties.

"(CNN) -- Despite telling the court they were indigent, George Zimmerman and his wife discussed -- in code, according to prosecutors -- money raised online to help in his defense on second-degree murder charges, jailhouse phone calls released Monday show. Prosecutors had claimed the Zimmermans lied about their financial means before a Florida judge set his bond, which the suspect then posted to get out of jail. Zimmerman, accused in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, is now back behind bars after the judge revoked his bail, citing the misrepresentations. Six calls made public Monday, out of about 151 total that Zimmerman made while incarcerated, appear to back up the prosecutor's assertions. Timeline of events in Trayvon Martin case . At her husband's April 20 bond hearing, Shellie Zimmerman testified she didn't know how much had been raised through the website her husband had set up before charges being filed. And when asked whether the couple had money available to assist in his defense, she replied, ""Um, not -- not that I'm aware of."" In one jailhouse phone conversation, Zimmerman asks his wife, ""In my account, do I have at least $100?"" She answers no, then tells him he has more like ""$8, $8.60."" ""So total everything, how much are we looking at?"" Zimmerman asks his wife. ""Like $155,"" she responds. Prosecutors claim the husband and wife were speaking in a type of code about their available funds, an assertion Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara says the defense has ""never contested."" ""There's no question that they were talking in this sort of simplistic kind of code, where they were talking about $155 when, without question, they were talking about $155,000,"" O'Mara told CNN's Piers Morgan on Monday night. In another call, Zimmerman asks his wife to ""pay off all the bills,"" including Sam's Club and American Express bills, prosecutors said. The couple also discusses how much money can be accessed and what to do with it, including transferring funds that were raised online for his defense to accounts belonging to Zimmerman's sister and wife, prosecutors state in a probable cause affidavit. Records released Monday show that tens of thousands of dollars were transferred out of a bank account. Prosecutors allege a total of $47,000 was transferred from George Zimmerman's account to his sister's account from April 16 and 17, and that Shellie Zimmerman transferred more than $74,000 from her husband's account to her account between April 16 and April 19. After George Zimmerman was released on bond this spring, his wife transferred more than $85,500 from her account back to his account, according to the affidavit. Prosecutors allege the couple actually had about $135,000 of donations at their disposal when they both told the court, under oath, they were indigent. O'Mara, Zimmerman's lawyer, later said his client ended up netting a total of $204,000 via PayPal accounts -- about $150,000 of which is now in an independently managed trust after $30,000 was used to pay for ""life in hiding"" and $20,000 has been kept liquid. On June 1, Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. agreed with the prosecution that the Zimmermans were dishonest about their financial status and, after revoking George Zimmerman's bond, ordered that he return to jail. He remains behind bars and has a second bond hearing set for June 29. On June 12, Shellie Zimmerman was arrested on a perjury charge, accused of lying at her husband's bond hearing about the couple's finances. She was released later that day after meeting the conditions of a $1,000 bond, the Seminole County Sheriff's Office said. The defense team on Monday filed a motion asking a judge to reconsider the release of a witness statement and to clarify a previous ruling on the release of additional jail phone calls. Both issues will be addressed during next week's bond hearing. It all ties into the larger case against Zimmerman, who prosecutors say ignored a police dispatcher's instruction and pursued Martin as he was walking in a Sanford, Florida, gated community last winter and shot the unarmed teenager. The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, meanwhile, has insisted he shot Martin in self-defense. Independent attorneys told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell the jailhouse recordings should be relevant in the case -- both as the judge weighs how high to set Zimmerman's bail and, once the trial begins, potentially affecting jurors' assessment as to whether his account of what happened February 26 can be trusted. While investigators talked to several neighbors and others, no one saw the shooting directly except for Zimmerman and the now-deceased Martin. ""His credibility is everything. Why would he risk it on something that is so trivial as this?"" Georgia-based lawyer Pilar Prinz said of the Zimmermans' jailhouse discussions about their money. "" I can't understand it."" O'Mara acknowledged the Zimmermans inflicted a ""great blow to their credibility,"" making it clear the two had available funds and were not honest about it -- something that might prompt Judge Lester to order the defendant to stay in jail until the trial because he feels ""he can no longer trust him."" But the lawyer said, in the 30 hours of calls between the couple, there's no indication the Zimmermans intended to deceive the judge, and also pointed out that his client came clean to him four days later. O'Mara also said the couple was stressed, fearful and distrustful at the time. ""I only hope that ... critics give it a more global perspective -- which is what (Zimmerman) was going through and what his family was going through as to why they may not have been completely honest about the money ... and sort of what they were facing,"" he said. Lastly, O'Mara stressed that the questions about their finances are distinct from what happened the night of the shooting. ""It truly has so little to do with what counts in the case, which is what happened when Trayvon Martin passed away,"" he said. More evidence to be released in Trayvon Martin case, judge rules . Besides the conversations about finances, the newly released phone calls shed light on the relationship between George and Shellie Zimmerman. In one exchange, they talk optimistically about their future together. ""After this, ... you're going to be able to just have a great life,"" Shellie Zimmerman said. ""We will,"" replies her husband. The two also talk about the support Zimmerman has received from the public, in the wake of the controversy that followed the Martin shooting.

"(CNN) -- Hollywood's stars may have moved on from the red carpets of Cannes, but the real ""jet set"" -- the CEOs and executives who decide how, when and what we fly -- are heading back to France. The A-listers of global aviation will be at Le Bourget from June 17 to 23 for the 50th Paris Airshow -- the biggest and most important event in the industry's calendar, where billion-dollar deals are done at the edge of the runway as stunt pilots swoop through the skies overhead. More than 2,100 companies from 44 countries around the world will fly in to showcase their wares at Le Bourget; from jumbo-sized jets and massive manufacturing tools to the tiniest springs, cogs and other components, as well as high-tech concepts which may not see the light of day for decades. In years gone by, the show, held at the airfield where Charles Lindbergh landed after his pioneering transatlantic flight in 1927, has seen the debuts of some of aviation's key developments -- from Concorde to the Boeing 747 and the Airbus A380. Read more: And the world's best airport is... This time around, those hoping to spot aerospace's next big thing may be out of luck. With just days to go before the visitors arrive, it is still unclear whether the industry's two most eagerly-awaited new planes, Airbus' A350 and Bombardier's C-Series, will be at the show. Both companies have warned the planes will be too busy carrying out flight tests to attend -- but industry experts say there's an outside chance they may still be spotted in the skies above Paris. ""We're still waiting to find out whether the A350 will put in an appearance,"" said Murdo Morrison, editor of aerospace industry magazine Flight International. ""That certainly would be a highlight -- it's one of the newest and most exciting aircraft, but it and Bombardier's C-Series are at a critical point in their development. ""It becomes a bit of a fight between the marketing people, the publicists, who want the company to get all the best headlines, and the engineers who are working to critical deadlines to get the plane ready to fly as soon as possible,"" he explained. Read more: Can 'game-changer' live up to name? ""What may happen is they pop in for one day -- fly in and then fly out again -- or even, in the case of the A350, that they do a flypast, without even landing."" With or without the C-Series and the A350, there will be plenty to look at, with flying displays, aerial acrobatics and all manner of military and commercial hardware ranged around the airfield for visitors to get up close to. Boeing is flying in not one but two 787 Dreamliners, and Airbus says that visitors will still be able to explore a full-size model of the A350's cockpit and cabin -- whether or not the real thing arrives. Show organizers say one of the highlights of the show for the general public (204,000 of whom visited in 2011) is likely to be the flying demonstrations by a Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jet. And fittingly, given that 2013's event will be the 50th Paris Airshow, there will be some looking back: homegrown French plane manufacturer Dassault will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its Mystere 20 business jet -- the first of which will be on display at Le Bourget.

But Morrison said the real purpose of the event, and the reason for its significance, is the dealmaking and discussions that go on behind closed doors. Throughout the show, the conference rooms and chalets lining the runway will play host to scores of high-powered briefings and meetings (in 2011 there were 151,000 trade visitors and 290 official delegations from around the world) at which aerospace movers and shakers will shape the future. ""The real reason the Paris Airshow exists is the industry side of things, the chance for face-to-face talks between suppliers and potential customers, the 'down-in-the-weeds' business discussions,"" he said. ""For some manufacturers the show is all about the race for orders, how many deals they've signed, and others make a point of avoiding that. But nobody really goes to Paris and decides there and then, 'I like that, let's buy two,' -- it's the meetings that matter.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- It is the middle of the night of Egypt -- time not to sleep, but to hit the streets and rally, whether out of pride or defiance. Cairo's Tahrir Square, the focal point of the 2011 popular revolution that led to the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak, filled with protesters angry at the man elected to succeed him, Mohamed Morsy. They vented, too, at the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group shunted aside under Mubarak that's now the most powerful political force in Egypt. A similarly spirited nighttime scene played out outside a Nasr City mosque about 13 kilometers (8 miles) to the east. The thousands of demonstrators gathered here, though, had a much different message: fervently backing Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood he once led. More such rallies, representing both sides of the political spectrum, are expected elsewhere around the North African nation later Sunday. The state-run Ahram news organization, for instance, noted that protests were in full swing early Sunday in Suez, Sharqia, Monofia and Gharbiya; so many people came out in Alexandria that traffic almost came to a standstill. What authorities hope there won't be more of, is violence. Clashes in recent days have claimed a number of lives, most of them people associated with the Muslim Brotherhood after their offices came under attack. Bystanders were affected as well. One of them was Andrew Pochter, a 21-year-old American in Alexandria to teach children English, who was stabbed to death Friday while watching the demonstrations, his family said. An Egyptian man died of a gunshot wound to the head, the health ministry said. State media reported that dozens more were injured in Alexandria unrest that also saw protesters demanding Morsy's ouster ransack the port city's offices of his Freedom and Justice Party, the Brotherhood's political wing. Hamdeen Sabahy, a leftist former presidential candidate, said in a video message posted Saturday that he and others challenging the Egyptian government ""reject the violence ... and all the attacks on the (offices) of the Muslim Brotherhood or their party."" ""Peace is our weapon,"" Sabahy said. He urged his followers to continue their demonstrations nationwide, saying, ""We are not fighting a rock, rather failing politics that do not meet the needs of the people."" ""We unite and know that strength is in the people,"" he said in the video posted on his Facebook page. ""We will be victorious, God willing."" Accepted order vs. change . Military security forces are patrolling streets around Egypt, in anticipation of rallies Sunday and fearful of looting, attacks on political or government offices, and violence generally. Morsy also met Saturday with his ministers of interior and defense to review security plans, state-run Ahram reported. Nearly a week ago, Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said the army would, if necessary, ""prevent Egypt from slipping into a dark tunnel of civil unrest and killing, sectarianism and the collapse of state institutions,"" raising the specter of a return to the powerful role it played in domestic politics under Mubarak. But Morsy is not Mubarak. He was democratically elected. Those results should be respected, say his supporters, who have taken to the streets by the thousands, many of them chanting their protest slogan: ""Democratic legitimacy is a red line."" Their show of support kicked off Friday in Nasr City, a Cairo neighborhood. Morsy's opponents have responded with more large-scale rallies of their own, including a sit-in planned for in front of the presidential palace in Cairo. The president's opponents have spent months collecting signatures on a petition calling for Morsy to step down and call new elections. The opposition includes a coalition of liberals, moderates and pro-democracy advocates who have joined those calling for the military to take over government and restore law and order. Muslim Brotherhood under fire . Since Morsy took office, Egypt's already sour economy has plummeted further as investors have pulled out of the country in droves and tourism has dropped. At the same time, crime in Egypt has shot up, and some are calling for a return to the law and order they knew under Mubarak's autocratic rule, carried out with the iron hand of the military. Morsy gave a speech this week highlighting his achievements during his first year in office. But opposition members said he did not address his shortcomings and called for snap presidential polls, a new government and constitutional amendments. The Muslim Brotherhood, whose leaders included Morsy before his election, has lost four members to violence in recent days. Two people were shot dead Thursday when armed men attacked Muslim Brotherhood offices in Zagazig, Morsy's hometown, spokesman Gihad Haddad said. The gunmen were shouting ""Down with Morsy"" during the assault, he said. Amnesty International called on authorities to uphold Egyptians' right to peaceful assembly and protect protesters and bystanders from violence. ""Given the appalling track record in policing demonstrations, it is absolutely imperative that the Egyptian authorities issue very clear instructions to security forces to uphold protesters' right to freedom of assembly and refrain from unnecessary or excessive force,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. ""They should make clear that anyone responsible for arbitrary and abusive force will be brought to justice."" In the past year, about 80 people have been killed during protests and other political violence largely attributed to security forces, Amnesty said. ""We're looking at the situation with concern,"" President Barack Obama said Saturday in Johannesburg, South Africa. Those concerns extend to keeping U.S. embassies, consulates, diplomats and other personnel safe, he said. ""Everyone needs to denounce violence,"" Obama said, adding he would favor talks between Morsy and the opposition. ""Nobody's benefiting now."" About 200 U.S. Marines in Sigonella, Italy, and Moron, Spain, have been put on alert as a precaution, according to two administration officials. The U.S. State Department warned Americans to cancel all but essential travel to or within Egypt. The United States has approved the departure of embassy and consulate employees and their dependents because of the unrest, a senior State Department official said. Nonessential employees and their relatives can get help leaving, if they choose to do so. Pochter, the Kenyon College student from Maryland killed in Alexandria, wanted to improve his Arabic before returning to college in the United States. ""He cared profoundly about the Middle East,"" his family said. He was planning a career in the region in hopes of forwarding the peace process. U.S. Marines told to be ready to go to Egypt .

"(CNN) -- The global center of gravity for aeronautics has undergone dramatic shifts over the past 110 years. Prior to World War II Europe dominated aviation with transatlantic Zeppelins, high-speed seaplanes and jet engine research. Post-war, the U.S. tookover in commercial jet transport as they engaged in an arms race with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Europe has staged a revival in commercial air transport, with Airbus and Boeing battling for airliners. But as economic power shifts to the Asia-Pacific, will we see the emergence of a new Seattle or Toulouse in Sao Paulo, Bangalore or Tianjin? The desire to build up an indigenous aerospace industry is easily understood. It provides highly-skilled, well-paid jobs and requires a large industrial supply chain. Prestige and international respect are an added bonus. More importantly, in the military sphere an aerospace industry assures that a nation can develop, build, operate and maintain the most advanced military equipment itself. Aerospace is also a lucrative business providing advanced technology products that command a premium. With giant orders from fast-growing Asian budget airlines Air Asia and Lion Air demonstrate, the potential is huge. Made in Brazil . One BRIC nation forging a path is Brazil. After national champion Embraer began in regional aircraft and military COIN aircraft, it has now successfully broken into the business jet market -- even to the extent of opening a factory in Florida. It will follow Airbus and Boeing in launching a re-engined version of its E-Jet airliner family. But it has big ambitions, too, in military aerospace -- its KC-390 transport aims to replace the Lockheed Martin C-130 as the jet-powered standard military transport. Meanwhile, its Super Tucano light attack aircraft was selected by the U.S. for supply to the Afghan Air Force -- a key achievement. India's drones . Elsewhere, India too has big plans -- although these revolve around military aerospace projects. It has a joint project with Russia to build stealth fighters and is also planning to develop its own stealth unmanned drone. However, despite its success in producing engineers and a vibrant IT sector -- it has struggled with indigenous aircraft programs. India's previous national fighter project, the LCA Tejas, suffered from a lack of a suitable engine. An even simpler light 14-seat commuter prototype, the NAL Saras, crashed in 2009. Nevertheless, joint turboprop transport projects with Russia suggest that India is not likely to give up just yet. Infographic: The state of global aviation . Military aircraft - A Soviet legacy? Russia, too, provides a paradox. An aerospace technology leader in the Cold War, it has skilled workers and access to advanced research centers -- especially in aerodynamics. Its proven Soyuz rocket remains the only way the astronauts of any nation can get to the International Space Station. But while it still remains a military aircraft powerhouse and exporter, its commercial success has been patchy. Russia's latest Sukhoi Superjet, despite help from Italian partners, seems unlikely to break out fully into the wider market beyond ex-CIS nations. A follow on single-aisle airliner, the MC-21 is destined to go up against the dominant Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX. Civil aviation in China . Finally, there is China -- a country with massive ambitions to propel itself into the top league of aerospace nations. In the past couple of years, analysts have seen an endless parade of once secret Chinese military aircraft revealed: two stealth fighter prototypes, attack helicopters, a four-engine military transport, various UAVs and the latest -- a stealthy attack drone. The country also has ambitions in civil aerospace -- however development of its previous airliner, the ARJ21, which first flew in 2008, is proceeding at a glacial pace. It is only likely to be used by Chinese or close allies of Beijing. Its latest prestige civil airliner project is the single-aisle COMAC C919 --which contains a high proportion of Western systems and equipment. First flight is expected in 2014 and China is hoping that this aircraft could gain it a foothold in the wider international market. Indeed in the past two years both Ryanair and IAG signed agreements to help develop this airliner. Could a western airline order be the big civil breakthrough for China? Aviation shifts East . And there are other challenges, too, for countries attempting to enter the highly competitive aerospace sector. High quality support and service of aircraft (both military and civil) means that manufacturers now need a global network of agents, service centers and aftermarket facilities to cater to demanding customers. In some respects it may actually be easier to put a human into space, than create a worldwide commercial airliner business from scratch. In short, there are signs that aerospace, like other industries, is undergoing a seismic shift eastwards. This is where the biggest passenger market will be. There will be many obstacles for those wanting to join this elite club but not all will make it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tim Robinson.","Tim Robinson is an aviation expert and the editor-in-chief of AEROSPACE magazine .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Oslo, Norway ranks as the world's most expensive city for expatriates, according to a new survey by ECA International, a global human resources consultancy firm. In the top 10, seven of the planet's priciest cities lie in Europe, two are found in Africa, while just one rests in Asia. The rise of Norway's capital to the top spot knocks Tokyo, Japan off the position it has claimed since 2010. This year, Japan's capital ranks as the world's sixth priciest city for overseas workers. ""Prices in Oslo tend to be more expensive compared to other parts of the world (because of) the cost of production and labor,"" says Lee Quane, Regional Director, Asia for ECA International. ""Services include dry cleaning, shoe repair, hair dressing - items which are more labor intensive - meals eaten out at restaurants as well. We also see the impact of taxes. For example alcohol and tobacco is relatively expensive."" According to ECA International data for Oslo, a movie ticket costs the equivalent of $18.76, a beer at a bar costs $14.10, while a soda will set you back $3.43. Tokyo's fall from the top of the charts follows weakness in Japan's currency over the past several months, adds Quane. The yen has fallen by as much as 20% since Shinzo Abe became prime minister in December 2012. Abe has laid out a plan for a return to inflation -- with an official 2% target -- after two decades of deflation, a stagnating economy and Japan's exporters like Sony and Panasonic recording billions of dollars in annual losses. A weaker yen gives more buying power to foreigners visiting and exchanging their money. Still Tokyo remains the most expensive city in Asia for expats, in the survey by ECA International, beating Seoul, Beijing, Singapore and Hong Kong. A ticket to a Tokyo movie will take $19.09 out of your wallet, a soft drink is a more affordable $1.61 compared to Oslo, while a kilo of rice costs $10.00 -- the highest price in the entire ECA International survey. Overall, Asia's city rankings have recently seen ""a lot of stability,"" adds Quane. The global position rankings of Hong Kong and Singapore have only ""moved one or two points"", which he considers ""a good thing"" and a signal towards a longer-term economic recovery after the 2008 global financial crisis. One surprise, says Quane, is the Philippine capital of Manila which jumped 19 points since the 2012 survey. ""The main reason was due to the strength of the currency. What we have seen is that the Philippines has been one of the strongest economies in Asia in the last 12 months as we've seen more foreign direct investment go there. Because of that, we've seen the currency strengthen and that pushed the Philippines up in ranking.""","Oslo is world's most expensive city in 2013 ECA International survey .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova has been forced to pull out of the WTA Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto next month, still plagued by a nagging left hip injury. Organizers of the prestigious hard court tournament announced Sunday that the four-time grand slam champion had withdrawn from the event that starts August 5. World No.2 Sharapova has not played since sensationally losing to Portuguese qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito in the second round at Wimbledon on the opening Wednesday. ""I am extremely disappointed that I am unable to play in Toronto next week as it's one of the best and most important tournaments of the year,"" the Russian said. ""I was looking forward to making a healthy return to the courts in front of my Canadian fans but unfortunately I'm just not recovered yet."" Sharapova, who recently took on former U.S. tennis legend Jimmy Connors as her coach, will be anxious to return as soon as possible with the U.S. Open looming. She will be left with only two hard court tournaments at Cincinnati and New Haven ahead of the final grand slam of the season on the same surface at Flushing Meadows. Meanwhile in ATP Tour action, Russia's Mikhail Youzhny won on the clay of Gstaad as he beat Dutchman Robin Haase 6-3 6-4 in Sunday's final. It was the ninth Tour title for the 31-year-old, who has waited over 18 months to return to the winners' circle. ""I'm trying everything to try and play more consistently at a high level,"" he told the ATP Tour official website. The tournament was marked by the early exit of home hero Roger Federer, with fellow Swiss and second seed Stanislas Wawrinka also following him out before the weekend action. The Croatia Open title went to Spain's Tommy Robredo, who beat Fabio Fognini of Italy 6-0 6-3 in the final. Victory for the fifth seed ended the Italian's 13-match winning streak which has brought him titles in Stuttgart and Hamburg. Fognini made 31 unforced errors and said the efforts of recent weeks had caught up with him. ""I would like to apologize to the fans that I could not give more in the final, but I'm simply too tired from other matches,"" he admitted.","Maria Shapapova pulls out of WTA tournament in Toronto .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal saw his incredible winning run at Monte Carlo ended last week but made no mistake Sunday in wrapping up his eighth Barcelona Open crown. Fellow Spaniard and fourth seed Nicolas Almagro was Nadal's victim as he clinched his 39th career title on clay with a 6-4 6-3 victory. Almagro, beaten in his nine previous matches with Nadal, took an early lead with a double break in the first set, but could not hold his advantage. Nadal was as relentless as ever on his favorite surface and needed only one hour 32 minutes to complete victory. ""This has been an important week for me. To win here again is a great joy after everything I've been through,"" Nadal told the crowd after his victory. ""It was a fantastic match for me."" Since returning to the ATP Tour following a seven-month injury layoff, he has reached the final in all six of the tournaments he has entered and won four of them, the first man to reach that mark this season. His Barcelona triumph, making it 39 straight wins in the Catalan capital, has been added to titles in Sao Paulo, Acapulco and the hard courts at Indian Wells. World No.1 Novak Djokovic denied Nadal a ninth straight title in Monte Carlo but sat out the Barcelona event. The pair are set to lock horns again at the Madrid Masters which starts next weekend as the build-up continues to next month's French Open where Nadal will be defending his crown. In other ATP final action Sunday,  Lukas Rosol, who stunned Nadal in the second round at Wimbledon last year, claimed his first career title in emotional fashion. The Czech beat Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3 6-2 in the Bucharest final and dedicated his victory to his father, who sadly passed away 10 days ago.","Rafael Nadal wins Barcelona Open title .

"(CNN) -- There will be no repeat of the 2012 men's singles final at the French Open after defending champion Rafael Nadal was drawn Friday in the same half as No.1-ranked Novak Djokovic for this year's second grand slam of the season. It means the pair are likely to face each other in the semifinals at Roland Garros as Nadal bids for an eighth crown and reigning Australian Open champion Djokovic attempts to take the French Open for the first time. With Andy Murray withdrawing earlier this week through injury, Nadal has been promoted to third seed. Read: No.2 Murray forced out of clay court grand slam . The Spaniard spent nearly eight months on the sidelines himself but since his return has won six tournaments, including back to back Masters titles in Madrid and Rome, lifting him up the rankings. He shrugged off the possibility of facing Djokovic in the last four rather than the final. ""It is what it is. If he and I are not number one and two in the world, then this can happen,"" Nadal told the official French Open website. ""But the tournament starts with the first round, and I'm sure both of us know we have a hard path before that."" Nadal will open proceedings against Germany's Daniel Brands, but a potential third round match would pit him against Lukas Rosol, who shocked him at last year's Wimbledon ahead of his lengthy injury layoff. Djokovic, who beat Nadal in April in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters, will play Belgium's David Goffin in the first round. In the other half, second seed Roger Federer will play qualifiers in this first two matches, with home hope Jo-Wilfried Tsonga a likely quarterfinal opponent and fourth seed David Ferrer of Spain in the semifinals. The women's draw has been kind to No.1 Serena Williams, who will begin her campaign against Anna Tatishvili. Defending champion and second seed Maria Sharapova has the tougher test, with Australian Open winner and third seed Victoria Azarenka in her half of the draw. But the Russia superstar is just proud to be back with the clay court grand slam under her belt. ""It's very meaningful to come back as defending champion,"" she said. ""Of course, there's always a bit of pressure coming back. But the draw looks good."" Action gets underway Sunday, but in the qualifying tournament Friday there was defeat for former World No.9 Andrea Petkovic.

"(CNN) -- Playing an anxiety-filled mobster made him famous, but it was the beloved, talented man stars and politicians turned out to bid farewell to on Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal is closing in on an eighth trophy in nine years at the Barcelona Open after storming past Canada's Milos Raonic 6-4 6-0 in the semifinal on Saturday. After a four-hour delay for rain, the Spaniard was soon behind as the No.5 seed won an early break. But Nadal fought back in typically ferocious fashion to take the first set and then overrun Raonic in the second to reach his seventh consecutive final since returning to the ATPTour in February following a knee injury. ""I think it was my best match of the whole week,"" Nadal said, ATPWorldTour.com reported. ""He played a fantastic second game on the return. I won the third game, which was very important for the match, because if you are 3-love down against a big server like Milos, you're in big trouble.""

I felt really good all the time during the match. I'm really happy to be in my first final in Barcelona ... "" Almagro said, ATPWorldTour.com reported. ""Every match I play against (Rafa) is fantastic. I'm ready for everything, so we will see what I can do on court."" It is the 20th time the 27-year-old has reached a World Tour final but he has a 0-8 record against Nadal -- the most recent defeat coming at the semifinal of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel in February. Meanwhile at the WTA event in Stuttgart, defending champion Maria Sharapova booked at place in Sunday's final after beating Germany's Angelique Kerber in three sets 6-3 2-6 7-5. The 26-year-old Russian eventually prevailed in two hours 16 minutes. After being taken the distance by Lucie Safarova and Ana Ivanovic in the previous two rounds, Sharapova dominated the first set of the semifinal breaking Kerber twice. But once again Sharapova was pegged back in the second, as the German rallied to take the set comfortably. The deciding third set was a real battle, as the pair shared five breaks -- the last fell to Sharapova who broke Kerber in the 12th and deciding game. ""All credit to Angelique, she played a great match. I won this tournament last year on the way to the French Open so I am really pleased to get back into the final again,"" Sharapova said.

"(CNN) -- Reigning champions Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova successfully began the defense of their titles at the French Open on Monday, a day when local player Gael Monfils stole the show by upsetting fifth seed Tomas Berdych. Nadal was the first on court, with his seven-month injury layoff making this the Spaniard's first grand slam match since being sensationally knocked out of Wimbledon last year by Lukas Rosol. With six titles in eight finals since his return in February, Nadal had been expected to cruise past Germany's Daniel Brands, 25. Instead, a man seeking a record eighth title at Roland Garros proceeded to do something he had never previously managed in the first round of a grand slam match - lose the opening set. This was unwanted history in his 34th grand slam tournament but a reminder of Nadal's dominance in Paris was underlined by this being only the 15th set he had lost in 54 matches at Roland Garros. The big-hitting Brands, ranked 59th, unleashed a fearless barrage of attacks off both sides and even led the second set tie break 3-0 only for Nadal to claim the set en route to a 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 6-3 victory. ""He was playing unbelievable. I tried to find my game and tried to resist his fantastic shots,"" said Nadal, who will face Martin Klizan of Slovakia for a place in the last 32. ""He played a great match and put me in a tricky situation."" There were no such troubles for Sharapova who brushed Taiwan's Hsieh Su-Wei aside in just 54 minutes. Surrendering only eight points on her serve, the second seed hit just four unforced errors as she set up a second round clash with Canadian teenager Eugenie Bouchard. The Russian was joined in the next round by three former champions: Li Na, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Francesca Schiavone. One player not expected to be joining such heavyweights was Slovak veteran Zuzana Kucova, who finally won a grand slam match after 12 years of trying. The 30-year-old produced a massive shock, knocking out local favorite and 24th seed Julia Georges in a 7-6 (10-8) 6-0 victory. After being off the tour for the last 18 months, Kucova is ranked 1,152 in the world but made the first round after coming through qualifying. She will take on Virginie Razzano in the second round, with the French player having enjoyed her greatest success when upsetting Serena Williams in the first round of last year's French Open. Kucova will struggle to beat Monfils for local press coverage though after the wild card knocked out fifth seed Tomas Berdych in a five-set thriller, winning 7-6 (10-8) 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-7 (4-7) 7-5 to delight a partisan crowd. The match took just over four hours and saw Monfils, currently ranked No. 81 after a knee injury forced him out of the world's top 100, dig deep to win the fifth after losing two tie breaks that could have finished the match early. World No. 2 Andy Murray, who withdrew ahead of the tournament because of injury, was among those impressed by the Frenchman's display against the 2010 semifinalist. ""You got to love Monfils,"" the Scot tweeted. ""Great entertainer, one of the most fun guys to watch and he's also a really good person."" Berdych's defeat means that three of the world's top 10 are no longer in contention, as the world No. 6 joined the injured Murray and Juan Martin del Potro in being forced to watch on from the sidelines. A semifinalist himself in 2008, Monfils, 26, faces Ernests Gulbis in the second round while fellow Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga eased through with victory over Aljaz Bedene. No Frenchman has won at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983. In other notable results on Monday, grand slam debutant Nick Krygios of Australia beat Czech veteran Radek Stepanek thanks to a 100% record in the tie breaks - the 18-year-old winning 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (10-8) 7-6 (13-11). At one point in the second set tie break, the winner of this year's Australian Open junior event trailed 6-0. And after sporting a new blonde hairdo during her routine defeat of Israel's Shahar Peer, Agnieszka Radwanska was refreshingly frank when asked what she knew about her next opponent, American Mallory Burdette. ""To be honest, not much. Nothing at all, actually,"" the fourth seed from Poland said with a smile. ""I might Google her.'' Should she beat the 22-year-old, Agnieszka may not have to do much work about her potential opponent in the third round - younger sister Urszula, who must beat Dinah Pfizenmaier of Germany first.","Reigning champions Rafa Nadal and Maria Sharapova start title defense with wins .

"(CNN) -- Few can claim to have had a bigger impact on the glittering coaching career of new Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola than Juan Manuel Lillo. Guardiola won a remarkable 14 trophies in his four years at Barcelona and regards the relatively unknown Spanish coach as his mentor. Lillo took his first coaching job at the tender age of 16 and went on to manage 13 clubs in his 19-year career, including Mexican side Dorados Sinaloa, where Guardiola finished his playing career. The pair met after Lillo had led lowly UD Salamanca to the top flight when he was still just 29 and a firm friendship began. Ironically, an 8-0 Spanish league defeat by Guardiola's Barcelona lost Lillo his last coaching job, at Almeria, but the 47-year-old remains a keen student of the game. CNN World Sport caught up with Lillo to ask him about his relationship with Guardiola and his thoughts on the Spaniard's move to the league-leading German Bundesliga club. Do you think Guardiola will have a lot of success at Bayern? For example, another Champions League, a league title or two? That's something no one knows, it's all up in the air. What I do know is that he will give them a playing style that will allow them to succeed and that he will help make those players into better people and better footballers. For me, that is what success is. If the ball hits the post instead of going in the goal, no one knows. What I do think is that he will be able to take them to a level where they are always right there in a position to win. But who knows if a Chelsea comes and sends you home despite you having them on their back heels next to their own goal for 70 minutes of the match -- that's football. Do you think Bayern was a good choice? Who am I to say what is a good or bad choice for someone else, but I think people will wait to see if it goes well or badly for him to say it was a good choice. Personally, I think it was a good choice because they have quite a few players that have that criteria and quality he looks for in various positions. They have already had success playing a similar style and have tasted what it can bring them, and finally they have the money to be able to go out and get the players that they currently lack to be able to play his way. We're also talking about one of the most important clubs of all time, that has a long history and currently has a very strong squad. I think they're a really good team and that both of them made a good choice. What did you see in Pep the first time you saw him play? The first time I saw him play, it made me so ecstatic that he could always keep the entire team in his head and know what to do in each situation to benefit the whole team. And he was so young when he did that! That ability to make everyone around him better... Knowing all that, did you think he would be a good coach? You've got to remember that I've always seen a coach that used to play, never a player that used to coach. Saying that, similar to a guard in basketball or a center back court player in handball, he was a rigorous organizer. What emerged from his playing days was a man concerned with the collective. He's a very involved manager; it has something to do with his personality, I think. He's a very good person. He's the type of person who thinks of solidarity, of the needs of everyone else, so of course his style of play was like his personality. Did his success at Barcelona surprise you? People forget he worked his way up from the second team at Barcelona. They didn't have the first-team players, but it was still a difficult category with a lot of nuances. He earned his marks there and then went on to win titles. Winning a title sometimes obviously requires a bit of luck -- if luck isn't with you, you won't win anything -- and he also had players like Messi. With people like that it makes it that much easier, but regardless, the merits of Pep are that he gave them a style, a criteria of play. He gave them an order ... he's given them lots of things that allowed them to succeed. Do you think part of his decision to choose Bayern was because of the stability it offers as opposed to, for example, Chelsea? I don't know if Pep made his decision thinking in the negative aspects of other clubs. Knowing him a bit, I think he made this decision solely because of what he liked at this club rather than what he didn't like at another club. Pep follows his heart a lot, so if he liked this club, he liked it, that's it. He didn't stop to think ""in this place, there's this. In this other place there's that."" No. I don't know if Chelsea even came to him, we just know that Bayern made a move for him. Do you think if he has a lot of success at Bayern, he would go to another country/club for another challenge? I don't know, we have to wait and see. What I will say is that he's the type of person who just because things are going well, he won't necessarily stay there. And if things are going badly, he won't necessarily leave just because things are bad.","Pep Guardiola's mentor Juanma Lillo says his former player will be a success at Bayern .

"(CNN) -- World number one Novak Djokovic eased any concerns over his ankle injury with a comprehensive win over Albert Montanes as the Serb eyes his third title at the Italian Open. The 2008 and 2011 champion twisted his right ankle in a Davis Cup match last month before appearing to damage it again in last week's Madrid Open defeat to Grigor Dimitrov. At Foro Italico however, Djokovic needed just 70 minutes to rally from an early break to beat qualifier Montanes 6-2 6-3. The six-time grand slam winner says the display is a step on the road to performing at this month's French Open as well as at Wimbledon in June. ""It was a good performance, even though I know I can do better,"" Djokovic, who has reached the Rome final four times in the last five years, told reporters. ""I know my game has to be better in order to win my next challenge. But I'm heading in a good way because I didn't have a great week in Madrid and didn't have much practice. ""I came here very early; from Wednesday I spent a lot of hours on the court working hard, trying to prepare myself for what's coming up this week and also after the tournament in Rome -- two Grand Slams in less than a month's time. ""It's a very important period for all of us and I need to be physically, mentally, fresh and fit and I think I'm on the right way to be like that."" The French Open gets underway in Paris on May 26 and finishes on June 9, just over a fortnight before the start of the Wimbledon championships. Federer, whose return to action in Madrid after a two-month break ended with a third-round loss to Japan's Kei Nishikori, also eased through to the third round after beating Italian wild card Potito Starace 6-1 6-2. Meanwhile, Serena Williams gained some family revenge when beating Laura Robson, who knocked sister Venus out in the first round, in straight sets. The world number one's comfortable day against the rising Briton was in stark contrast to many of her seeded colleagues, three of whom crashed out on Tuesday. Poland's fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska was the highest to fall, losing 6-7 6-1 6-2 to Simona Halep of Romania in the second round, but she may have gained some consolation by seeing sister Urszula inflict defeat on 15th seed Ana Ivanovic. Tenth seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark also failed in her bid to reach the second round, as the former world number one let slip a 5-2 lead against 48th-ranked Bojana Jovanovski in a third set tiebreak. The girlfriend of golfer Rory McIlroy has struggled on clay this season, exiting in the first round in both Spain and Germany over the last month, and now succumbing at the first hurdle once again. Jovanovski, 21, ended a poor run of form as the Serb claimed her first victory since the Australian Open in January. 2011 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova became the first woman into the third round as she beat Germany's Sabine Lisicki in another match that went to three sets.","Djokovic and Federer put Madrid behind them as they cruise into Italian Open third round .

"(CNN) -- It was the ultimate gathering of tennis talent. A host of No.1 ranked women's players, including Serena Williams, marked the 40th anniversary of the WTA with a unique get together at Wimbledon Sunday. Williams, the latest in an elite list of women to reach the summit of the game since a unified women's tour was founded in 1973, led the tributes to Billie Jean King, the driving force and first president of the association. ""Billie Jean has been my ultimate inspiration and taught me so many things about being a champion and staying a champion,"" she told CNN. ""We are celebrating 40 amazing years of the WTA and none of this would have been possible if she hadn't taken a stand for everyone."" King, who won 12 grand slam singles titles, organized the meeting at the Gloucester Hotel in London, just a week before the 1973 Wimbledon Championships, where the Women's Tennis Association formally came into being. One voice . ""We were working together to gain recognition for the future generation and to have one voice,"" she told CNN. ""Sixty three of us got in a room, we locked the door, we elected the officers and we were in business,"" she recalled. King's great rivals at the time, Australian pair Margaret Court and Evonne Goolagong, were among the special invitees to the anniversary celebration, along with current stars such as Williams and her arch-rival Maria Sharapova. To the left of Williams were Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who between them occupied the No.1 spot for 592 weeks. Swiss miss Martina Hingis, fourth in the all-time list for week's in the top spot and Monica Seles, also sat side by side. Old rivalries . Seles, who battled it out for top spot with the likes of Hingis, and U.S. pair Jennifer Capriati and Lindsay Davenport, enjoyed being reunited with them, with old rivalries long forgotten. ""It's a celebration where once we are retired we can relax, we don't have competitive pressures and we can be friends,"" she told CNN. Germany's Steffi Graf, who tops the list, was a notable absentee, as was Belgian favorite Kim Clijsters as she is expecting her second child soon. In recent years, a clutch of players such as Dinara Safina, Jelena Jankovic, Ana Ivanovic, Caroline Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka, have all briefly topped the rankings before Williams has reasserted her dominance in the game by winning three of the last four grand slams. Her 6-2 6-0 dismissal of Kimiko Date-Krumm Saturday took her into the last 16 as she bids to defend her Wimbledon crown. Confident coach . Her coach and partner Patrick Mouratoglou told CNN that Williams was well prepared for her tilt at a 17th grand slam crown. ""She is in good form and for the past year has been working really really hard,"" he said. ""She has big goals and has done all the work necessary to be in a position to win a grand slam."" Canadian teenager Eugenie Bouchard, who upset Serbia's Ivanovic in the second round, represented the younger generation at the celebration along with American Madison Keys. She fully appreciates the part played by King and other former players in helping bring riches and media attention to the women's game. ""I've learned all about it, it's a special event,"" she told CNN.","Unique gathering of former women's No.1 tennis players at Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- The brazen escape of a notorious gangster in France may be due partly to a problem plaguing the prison that couldn't hold him: overcrowding. There is a clear ""overpopulation problem in the Sequedin prison and this hinders the job of guarding prisoners,"" a spokesman for the French Ministry of Justice told CNN on Sunday, commenting on the escape of Redoine Faid. Faid allegedly held five people, including four guards, at gunpoint at the detention center in the northern city of Lille on Saturday, officials said. He burst his way to freedom by allegedly detonating explosives that destroyed five doors, penitentiary union spokesman Etienne Dobrometz told CNN affiliate BFMTV. His whereabouts are unknown. French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira told reporters on Saturday that a European arrest warrant covering 26 countries had been issued and that Interpol had been called in. An Interpol spokesman told CNN no public notice had been issued on Faid. Interpol can also issue ""restricted"" notices that are not public. The spokesman did not say whether one had been issued in this case. Police detained a brother of Faid for questioning only, according to a law enforcement source, who did not provide other details about that development. The source spoke on the condition of not being identified because the person is not permitted to discuss the matter publicly. The source also estimated that up to 150 French police are working on the case. Faid's prison escape raises a number of questions: How did an inmate get guns and explosives? How did he manage to use those to force his way out? And, after all that, why is he still at large? The four guards who Faid allegedly held hostage ""are safe and sound,"" said Lille prosecutor Frederic Fevre. Still, officials from the prison guards' union pressed Taubira to provide better safety measures inside prisons, including more thorough searches of those who enter, BFMTV reported. Built in 2005, the Lille-Sequedin penitentiary is not old, but it's not well designed to keep watch of prisoners, said Jimmy Delliste, a former associate director there. ""The construction ... makes it particularly difficult to manage detainees, who are particularly difficult to watch,"" Delliste told BFMTV. Modern-day gangster . Faid fashioned himself as a modern-day gangster. He thought big -- getting inspiration from the movies. He wore a hockey mask, like Robert DeNiro's character in ""Heat,"" and acted audaciously in attacking armored trucks among other targets. After more than a decade in prison, though, the Frenchman insisted he'd changed. This promise didn't last long, according to French authorities. A year after his autobiography was published, Faid, who was free at the time, landed back behind bars in 2011. One person not surprised by Faid's breakout is his lawyer, Jean-Louis Pelletier. Pelletier had planned to meet his client soon in preparation for an upcoming trial tied to a May 2010 attack in Villiers-sur-Marne, east of Paris, that left a 26-year-old policewoman dead. ""He is remarkably intelligent, and he is using his intellect to serve his ambitions,"" Pelletier told BFMTV. ""(And Faid) cannot stand being imprisoned anymore."" In his autobiography, ""Robber: From Suburbs to Organized Crime,"" Faid chronicled his progression from a petty thief to one of France's most notorious criminals, according to the book's publisher, La Manufacture De Livres. In 1998, after three years on the run during which he fled to Switzerland, Faid was caught. Sentenced to 20 years, he ended up spending more than a decade in high-security prisons around France. After being released, Faid put himself out there -- not only with his book, but also as the subject of numerous interviews. The high-adrenaline life of crime he described resembled that of another famous French gangster, Jacques Mesrine. The country's most-wanted man in the 1970s, Mesrine made his name as a charismatic, press-courting criminal known for his daring bank heists and spectacular prison breaks. Mesrine's story ended in 1979, when he was gunned down by police on the streets of Paris.","French justice officials say there is a clear prison ""overpopulation problem""

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal may have lost his coveted Monaco crown on Sunday but that defeat was soon forgotten as the Spaniard set about another title defense in Barcelona. The 26-year-old ""King of Clay"" began his hunt for an eighth Barcelona Open title with a swift victory over Carlos Berlocq. Nadal broke the world No. 63 four times on his way to a straightforward 6-4 6-2 win to cruise into the third round, extending his record to 2-0 against the Argentine -- who he also beat in the second tournament of his comeback from knee injury in Brasil two months ago. The red clay of Barcelona is another happy hunting ground for Nadal. He has won 35 straight matches at the event; his last defeat was handed out by fellow Spaniard Alex Corretja 10 years ago. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic ended Nadal's long unbeaten run at his favorite event in Monte Carlo when he beat him in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters -- a tournament he had won eight years in a row. Despite his dominance in Barcelona, the world No. 5 was not given top status at the event, instead compatriot David Ferrer was named as the No. 1 seed. But his top billing proved to be a curse as the world No. 4 crashed out 7-5 3-6 6-1 in the second round to Russian Dmitry Tursunov. ""I did not feel well on the court today,"" Ferrer, who is a four-time runner-up in Barcelona, told reporters. ""It was the worst match that I've played in the last couple of years. ""I lost the third set too fast. He was better and more aggressive. I just did not feel good."" Ferrer was playing for the first time since injuring his thigh in the final of the Miami Masters, which he lost to British world No. 3 Andy Murray. The Barcelona Open presents another opportunity for Nadal, and his fellow clay-court specialists, to tune-up for the French Open which begins on May 26. Nadal, who has a 271-21 record on clay, is aiming to extend his record number of titles at Roland Garros, the second grand slam of the year, to eight in 2013. ""It was not very comfortable and it affected my game,"" Nadal told reporters ahead of his third-round tie with Frenchman Benoit Paire. ""I don't want to talk about being a title favorite, I'm just very happy to be playing well and into the third round. I'm not looking ahead.""","Rafael Nadal continues his Barcelona Open winning streak in first match .

"(CNN) -- Wimbledon officials have announced the biggest increase in prize money in the history of tennis as part of a bid to make the sport attractive for future generations of players. The All England Club, which organizes the oldest grand slam tournament, has hiked prize money by 40% to $34.4 million so the winners of the men and women's competitions will each take home $2.4 million. Wimbledon has also revealed that it will build a roof over Court No. 1, with the structure expected to be completed in time for the 2019 tournament. The retractable roof, which is expected to be similar to that which has been in place on Center Court since 2009, will allow matches to progress despite any bad weather -- with rain a regular threat at the grass-court event. Wimbledon's announcement regarding the increase in prize money on offer comes following a similar move by organizers of the Australian Open last October. Players in Melbourne in January competed for a share of $31.1 million following an increase of $4.12 million. This year's U.S. Open will have its prize fund increased by $4 million to $29.5 million, while next month's French Open will see the winners earn $1.95 million with the total purse up by 16%. The increases in prize money come following pressure from top players concerned with the huge disparities between those who exit grand slam tournaments at an early stage and those who go much further. At Wimbledon, the purse for winning the title has gone up with the male and female winner taking home a check of Â£1.6 million -- a 39% increase on last year. Wimbledon, which will be held from June 24 to July 7 this year, has also put more cash into the opening three rounds of the tournament by 60%. Players losing in the first round will net $35,800, which is a big improvement on the $22,100 they would have picked up in 2012. On top of that, the reward for qualifying for the tournament proper has gone up by 41% for singles players and 22% for doubles players. ""We need to make sure we are competitive as a sport,"" All England Club chief executive Richard Lewis told the UK Press Association. ""It is not just about the top players, it is about making the sport attractive to the next generation of talent. ""That means players ranked from 50 to 100 and 100 to 200 need to be able to look at the sport and know they can make a good living. ""To be fair to the players and the players' associations, that is one of the points they made to us, which we at never at any stage pushed back on. It is a legitimate point. ""We operate as a global event as a global sport and we need to be competitive for all sorts of positive reasons."" The news has been greeted with excitement by some players, with world No. 98 Sergiy Stakhovsky taking to Twitter to register his excitement. ""I don't want to sound crazy but I would like to give a big HUG to @Wimbledon board..exciting news..thank you very much gentlemen!!"" he tweeted after the announcement. According to the men's ATP World Tour website, the Ukrainian has career earnings of $2.65 million, having been ranked as high as 31st, which pales into insignificance compared to world No.1 Novak Djokovic. The Serb star has raked in $3.92 million in 2013 alone and $49.6 million in his career overall. Philip Brook, chairman of the All England Club told the tournament's official website: ""For the players, it is a deep appreciation of the demanding nature of professional tennis and the top-quality entertainment they bring, while for The Championships it is about giving all our visitors the finest stage on which to enjoy Wimbledon."" Last year Wimbledon made a profit of Â£37.8 million ($57.5 million) -- an increase of 7%. Most of that is given to the Lawn Tennis Association to invest in developing British tennis.","Wimbledon announces 40% increase in tournament's prize fund .

"(CNN) -- The British royal family has a long history with the sea. Queen Elizabeth II's much beloved Royal Yacht Britannia carried members of the monarchy on almost 1000 official voyages over 44 years, from her launch in 1953 to her decommissioning in 1997. Her Majesty was seen wiping a tear away at the farewell ceremony for Britannia, which was launched in 1953 with a dual purpose - to provide royal travel around the Commonwealth and to act as a hospital ship in time of war. Now UK media reports that Conservative member of parliament Michael Gove has suggested the Queen should be given a new yacht to mark this year's diamond jubilee. What would go into designing a yacht fit for the Queen of England? We ask some yacht designers what they would do if they received the commission of a lifetime. A ""timeless"" creation . ""Any royal yacht is around for some time,"" says Ken Freviokh. ""It needs to be timeless and look as good in ten years time as it did on its launch."" The yacht designer would draw on the last Britannia as a source of inspiration for a new royal yacht. He says a highlight of the vessel is its ""beautiful"" proportions which he would replicate for his own creation. ""It should embody the elegance of the old Britannia, but equally it could be a little bit daring,"" adds Freviokh. But while taking inspiration from the 125 meter yacht, the designer insists it should not be a copy. ""A new royal yacht shouldn't be conventional,"" he says. ""But it shouldn't have any 'trendy' solutions, it needs to be quite distinguished."" Flexibility is essential for a head of state's yacht according to Freviokh. From official tours of the Commonwealth to honeymoons, the last Britannia was used for a range of activities. Freviokh would design large spaces that can be opened up when entertaining, and closed in with glass when the weather commands. ""It has to be a little bit of a transformer,"" he continues. ""The area needs to be used all year around in all temperatures, from the warm Mediterranean to the cooler northern waters near Scotland."" Royal superyachts: How kings and queens sail the sea . It's not all business for the royals, and Freviokh says he'd take into account the more intimate occasions when creating spaces, allowing a banquet room to be converted into smaller family areas. ""People should melt"" Tony Castro wants onlookers to be captivated by any royal yacht he would design. ""People should melt when they see it,"" the designer says. ""It should immediately send out a message."" Castro would take into consideration the role a royal vessel plays when designing one. He says the boat is a great tool to promote the country and grab people's attention, whether they are heads of state, captains of industry or fundraisers. ""It's a great way to get people together to sell a message -- no one could turn down an invitation to the royal yacht."" Castro says the yacht must display the best of local talent -- technically perfect so it can ""show off Britain's capabilities"" and modern. But Castro says any futuristic design should not include ""wacky"" features. ""It can't be too much about the fashion."" The cost-savvy approach . In times of austerity, questions would be raised over the cost of any new royal yacht at the expense of the taxpayers. With that in mind Stephen Huish believes he has the solution for any penny-pinching royal -- buy second-hand. HMS Victory: World's oldest warship to get $25m facelift . ""In the current market, it's so much cheaper to buy an existing yacht and re-fit and condition it,"" says Huish. He thinks a complete interior overhaul and a good paint job would suffice. But Huish insists that does not mean that style would be compromised. ""Extravagant areas could be done with more lavish woods,"" he explains. ""The outside should be modern but I don't think the royal family would go for a highly modern interior, it would have to be traditional,"" says the designer who thinks furnishing should be classic with a slight modern twist such as simple mouldings made out of wood. Huish also highlights the need for flexibility. ""I would have large VIP guest cabins where bulkheads could be cut off so it could be broken off into two or three rooms if need be."" But if the Queen did not want a pre-loved model, Huish believes there's never been a better time to commission a yacht with an industry facing tough economic challenges; the royal is more likely to get more for her pound.","A UK politician has suggested the Queen should be given a new yacht to mark this year's diamond jubilee .

"(CNN) -- Over the past decade the Middle East has made a massive move to secure some of the world's major sporting events. Abu Dhabi won the right to host a Formula One Grand Prix beginning in 2009, Qatar was successful in its FIFA World Cup bid for 2022 and the world's top tennis players and golfers regularly head to the region for big tour tournaments. Among the sporting push in the region is sailing; nine teams are currently taking part in the ""Sailing Arabia - the Tour"" -- the Middle East's version of Europe's Le Tour de France a la Voile. The event sees the fleet sail throughout the region from Bahrain to Oman. It is the second time it has been held but it is not the only sailing competition to take place in the region this year. ""We do always try to approach the prime events,"" says Faisal Abdulla Al Sheikh from the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority. ""Of course (there is) the Volvo Ocean Race, the first ever Middle East stop over."" The United Arab Emirates was this year included in the Volvo Ocean Race for the first time in its 39-year history. The 39000 nautical mile challenge, that sees six professional crews race across the world over eight months, incorporated a Cape Town to Abu Dhabi leg. The decision to include the Middle Eastern stopover provided unique challenges. Parts of the leg were shrouded in secrecy because of concerns over piracy. It was split into two sections and the race boats had to be loaded onto a cargo ship and taken to Sharjah in the UAE for the final sprint to Abu Dhabi. See also: Abu Dhabi: Stepping out of Dubai's shadows . ""For us the race is aiming at being a very global competition so we need to expand,"" says Knut Frostad, CEO of the Volvo Ocean Race. ""We need to make sure we cover as many markets as we can and Abu Dhabi and a few other players wanted to be serious about sailing."" ""Obviously there is an economic factor,"" he adds. ""There's no doubt that this region is less affected by the crisis we have in Europe."" See also: Volvo Ocean Race: The 'Everest of sailing' Other sailing organizations too are seeing the financial benefits of the Middle East. The independent sailing company Pindar began its push into the region around four years in Bahrain. Pindar set up sailing programs and launched the boat ""Kingdom of Bahrain"" -- which in 2009 was briefly held by Iranian authorities when the crew was accused of straying into Iranian waters en route to Dubai for a race. Pindar CEO, Andrew Pindar, sees the Middle East as providing a lot of economic opportunities for organizations like his. ""There is a lot of stability in the region and a lot of investment,"" he says. Pindar says its warm climate and location are huge draw cards for the sailing world. ""For most of the year it has good sailing conditions; warm water, good winds,"" he says. ""It's in the middle for people coming from Europe and Australasia,"" which Pindar adds is ideal for competitive sailing. But it's not only the competitive sailing world that is being drawn to the Middle East, with the large expat community and corporate world providing a new sailing audience. Pindar says the opportunities are available in the Gulf, as long as organizations are willing to put in the hard work. ""If you go there with the right idea or the right approach then people will back you, but they don't do it immediately."" The CEO says there has been a real push for sailing in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and thinks the Volvo Ocean Race's presence in the Middle East will do a lot to boost the sport's profile. Unlike that event, participants in ""Sailing Arabia - the Tour"" compete only for the pride of winning. The fleet is a mixture of professionals and amateurs, with many only having a few months experience on the water. Oman Sail runs the event and its CEO David Graham says the organization is trying to promote competition amongst the Gulf nations. ""Sailing has always been in the Middle East, it has very deep and strong roots,"" Graham says. ""What's becoming more of a focus now is the sport of sailing."" See also: Oman women's Olympic ambitions . Oman Sail aims to promote sailing and has established pioneering initiatives to encourage people across Omani society to take up the sport. In the past three years it has taught thousands of children how to sail and is helping develop a women's squad in an effort to boost Oman's Olympic chances. ""Without doubt sailing is on the upwards spiral in the Middle East,"" says Graham.","The Middle East has moved to secure some of the world's major sporting events .

"(CNN) -- Detroit's recent filing for bankruptcy is an exclamation point at the end of a tumultuous few decades for what was once America's greatest industrial city. The story of Detroit is well-documented: anchored to America's automotive companies, Detroit struggled with cheaper imported cars as the Big Three automakers shed jobs and built plants elsewhere. Detroit's and the auto companies' problems are inextricably tied together. The situation of General Motors, which culminated in a Washington bailout, was simple: Management placated the unions and put off pay raises by promising them more and more benefits. The problem was that as GM's dominance eroded, leading to its own bankruptcy filing, so too did its ability to live up to its promises to the unions. Opinion: Detroit, the 'used to be' city . As this was happening, Detroit, long a union town, had a separate but related problem. With a shrinking population, fewer and fewer taxpayers were available to pay to support government services. Riddled with rampant corruption and mismanagement, the city made promises to its public employees: $9.2 billion in retiree health care and pension commitments that it simply cannot afford. This all led to the city filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which provides for the reorganization of municipalities. This is a tragedy for those government workers who had been relying on the promised pension benefits and who will end up paying the price. To be clear, Detroit is an extreme example, but there are states and municipalities across America that simply cannot afford their pension obligations. The Pew Center for the States found that states' public pension plans faced a stunning $757 billion shortfall in 2010. And some economists place the figure as high as $4.4 trillion in 2012. Chicago's credit rating was just downgraded because of its $19 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Los Angeles, America's second-largest city, could see up to $30 billion in pension obligations. The fear is that some of these cities will declare bankruptcy and a Washington bailout will make innocent taxpayers in Utah and across the country foot the bill, which just isn't fair or right. I spent a good deal of time looking at this crisis. For many teachers, police and firefighters, the promise isn't a robust paycheck but robust retirement benefits. But if the promise can't be fulfilled, they are left with little retirement security. The question is whether there is another option for these cities and municipalities that is fair to those workers and to taxpayers alike? There is, and it's by moving away from these traditional defined benefit pension plans and into something called an annual annuity. Instead of a city putting money into a pension fund that could be raided or underfunded at any time, that money would go into a fixed insurance contract with the employees. It could never be stolen by government and workers get the money they are promised once they retire. Opinion: How Detroit can rise again . Under the plan, the employer pays a premium each year to a life insurance company, which is responsible for investing that money and paying the fixed pension when the worker reaches retirement age. The annuity contracts will be competitively bid, and state insurance departments will supervise the companies. In the rare event that a life insurer becomes insolvent, each state has a life insurance guaranty association that will ensure the payment of annuity benefits to retirees. This is a very different approach than has been tried before. I understand some public employee unions don't trust an idea they've never considered before, but it's a way of guaranteeing that going forward, cities and municipalities can get their pension obligations off the books, that workers will get the retirement that is promised to them and that there isn't a Washington bailout of those who couldn't find a solution to their ballooning debt. And while public sector debt continues to grow, it's imperative that we incentivize private sector retirement savings as well. That's why my bill includes key reforms that would give job creators and American workers stronger tools for providing pensions and better, more secure retirement savings. The legislation, for example, creates a new plan called the Starter 401(k) to help a small or start-up business easily create and maintain a stable retirement savings plans for their employees. RoboCop creator: Detroit shows film's functional future is upon us . Detroit's bankruptcy isn't the end for that city. It marks a new beginning. Looking at the crisis that led to this situation, hopefully we can confront the looming problems of retirement savings on the public and private side so Americans are more secure once they leave work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Orrin Hatch.","Sen. Orrin Hatch: Cities including Detroit struggling to pay public worker pensions .

"(CNN) -- It was in the majestic surroundings of Muirfield that the original gold-plated superstar of golf secured his first major title. The small town of Gullane to the east of Edinburgh that is all set to welcome the modern titans of the game for the 142nd staging of the British Open played host to a true pioneer back in 1896. Harry Vardon won a total of six British Open titles, a record that still stands, but his achievements in the game stretch far beyond his haul of majors, which was lifted to seven by his 1900 U.S. Open triumph. Not only was he credited with sparking an explosion of interest in the game during his tours of America at the turn of the 20th Century but he also devised the grip- -- ""the overlapping grip"" or the ""Vardon overlap"" -- that 90 percent of golfers still deploy. It is little wonder he is spoken of in such glowing terms by Australian Peter Thompson, who alongside American legend Tom Watson, is just one British Open triumph behind Vardon's half-dozen successes. ""He was the God of golf,"" Thompson told CNN's Living Golf show. ""To aspire to such a position was sacrilege -- it was way out of my league. ""It wasn't until I passed five that I thought, 'Well, it's possible to equal the great man' but I didn't do it, regrettably. ""It must have been inspirational to watch him swing. He had the power of a winning champion. Had someone won seven or even six Opens we wouldn't have had Vardon as a God. ""It is perfect it is in stone and concrete that he should be the man who won six. It hasn't happened before and it isn't likely to happen for many years. ""I don't think anyone will reach six because the competition there is today makes it more difficult. There are at least 25 players that have a chance of winning any major tournament."" Vardon's prowess on the golf course is indisputable. His entry in the Hall of Fame quotes famed golf writer Bernard Darwin as saying: ""I do not think anyone who saw him play in his prime will disagree as to this, that a greater genius is inconceivable."" But his legacy stretches far beyond the beauty of the links courses upon which he flourished, securing his first three championships before the turn of the century. He became the game's first international superstar when he traveled to the United States in 1900, playing 80 exhibition matches around the country, his tour culminating in that U.S. Open triumph. Thousands flocked to see him in action, with many scurrying back to their own courses to try and replicate what they had just seen. ""There is absolutely no doubt that that the great boom of golf in America was started by Harry Vardon,"" said David Crawford, former head greenkeeper at Royal Jersey, where Vardon learnt the game. ""The number of people who flooded to see his exhibition matches, the fact that he was asked back again and again prove that. ""He brought golf into the mainstream for everyone to play and I think that was probably his greatest achievement. ""And of course he'll be forever immortalized because of his most famous grip, there's no getting away from it."" Vardon was born into a working class family in Jersey, a British outpost off the coast of Normandy in France, and honed his game when the island got its first golf course in 1878. Both Harry and his younger brother started out as caddies and invested hours on practicing their swings, despite their father's disapproval of the game. Harry's career blossomed when he left Jersey for the English mainland, where his dedication to his craft and insistence on wearing knickerbockers made him stand out from the crowd. His victory at Muirfield in 1896 announced his prowess to the world and irked the man he beat -- two-time Open champion Willie Park Junior. ""Park was so upset he challenged Vardon to a home and away match for Â£100,"" Crawford explained. ""It was a year before they came to play it and Vardon was two shots up after the first tie at North Berwick where around 10,000 people came to watch. ""In the second match Vardon annihilated Park, who went on to become an architect because he knew he wasn't going to win anything with Vardon around. ""Vardon was extremely accurate, a straight driver with an immaculate short game. It has been said his putting stroke wasn't that great but I don't believe you could win all those tournaments with a weak putting stroke. ""He had the complete all round game at the height of his powers."" Vardon went on to claim three more Open titles before he was struck down by tuberculosis, spending long spells in sanatoriums until 1910. Yet despite his faltering health, and general lack of fitness, he still came back to win the Open twice more -- in 1911 and 1914. According to another graduate of the Jersey links, former Ryder Cup star Tommy Horton, Vardon's success is made all the more remarkable given his physical frailties. ""He was never very fit, and when you think about 1914 when he won his last Open, they took him out of hospital two or three weeks before the Championship, because he had tuberculosis,"" he said. ""Vardon was never a very fit man and he had only a few weeks practice, fresh out of hospital and went out and won the Open Championship. That to me is incredible."" Vardon eventually died in 1937 at the age of 66. While illness hampered his career in large parts, it may have also helped prolong it. ""It's not very common knowledge, but Harry Vardon was planning to go to promote the equipment he sponsored, or the sponsors promoted for him, in America,"" Horton added. ""He was going for two or three months as he'd done before -- they liked him in America -- but he fell sick, and because of that he didn't travel on the Titanic."" Vardon's haul of six Open titles is unlikely to be matched any time soon, but had it not been for The Great War, it could have been more. ""He lost six years out of his professional life,"" Crawford added. ""Goodness knows how many Opens Vardon could have won.""","Harry Vardon has won six British Open titles, more than anyone else in history .

"(CNN) -- For the South Korean who picked up the second major title of her career to move up to second in the world rankings, it was a walk in the Park. Inbee Park led the field by three strokes heading into the final day of the Kraft Nabisco Championship, carding a three-under-par final round of 69 to finish 15-under for the tournament - four strokes ahead of compatriot Ryu So-Yeon. After taking the traditional plunge into Poppy's pool at the Mission Hills Country Club, Park is setting her sights on usurping Stacy Lewis and becoming the world's top-ranked female golfer. ""That's the place that I've always wanted and I only have one more spot to go,"" the 24-year-old told the LPGA Tour's official website after clinching 2013's opening major. ""That brings a lot of momentum, keeps momentum going for me, especially after this week. I felt a lot of confidence with my swing and with my putting. Everything has been going the right way this season. It feels good."" American Lewis was full of praise for Park, hailing the 2008 U.S. Women's Open winner as ""the best putter on Tour."" ""I've seen Inbee do this before,"" said Lewis, who finished 14 shots adrift of Park. ""When she rolls it, you just can't beat her.

"(CNN) -- If this is an indication of what Roger Federer will do at Wimbledon, his opponents had better watch out. Federer recorded the second double bagel of his career when he defeated wildcard Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 on Friday to reach the semifinals of a Wimbledon warm-up in Halle, Germany. The only other time Federer didn't drop a game in a match was at the year-end championships in 2005 against clay-court specialist Gaston Gaudio. ""You never go to court aiming for such a score,"" Federer, who turns 32 in August, told reporters. ""I'm surprised to have managed it today."" At Wimbledon, which begins on June 24, Federer will be bidding to advance to a first grand slam final since claiming a seventh title on the Wimbledon grass a year ago. He lost to Tomas Berdych in the U.S. Open quarterfinals last September, Andy Murray in January's Australian Open semifinals and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in this month's French Open quarterfinals. Federer knows the chances of registering a second consecutive double bagel are slim. He meets local favorite and the man who beat him in last year's final in Halle, Tommy Haas, in the last four. ""I expect a completely different opponent tomorrow,"" Federer said. Haas and Federer, good friends, played doubles together this week in Halle. ""He is one of the greatest of all time, perhaps the greatest,"" said Haas. Haas, the 35-year-old third seed, rallied from a set down to oust Gael Monfils 6-7 (4) 6-3 6-3. But he was the only German winner on the day. Besides Zverev, sixth-seed Philipp Kohlschreiber and eighth-seed Florian Mayer were also sent packing. French second-seed Richard Gasquet topped Mayer 6-3 7-6 (4) and Russian Mikhail Youzhny beat Kohlschreiber, the 2011 champion, 6-3 6-2. At Queen's Club in London, the other men's warm-up taking place this week, top-seed Andy Murray progressed to the semifinals with a 6-4 7-6 (3) victory over Germany's Benjamin Becker. The Scot returned from a back injury at Queen's and hasn't lost a set in his three matches, despite several stops and starts due to rain. He has shared the spotlight at Queen's with veteran and four-time winner Lleyton Hewitt. ""I thought the first set was good, and then he started playing much better in the second,"" Murray said in a televised interview. ""I just managed to hang tough and get the win. The conditions were tough, again, but it's only my first week on grass."" While Federer tries for an eighth success at Wimbledon, Murray will attempt to end a 77-year British men's singles drought at the All England Club. His next foe is fourth-seed Tsonga, who suffered a painful semifinal defeat to David Ferrer on home soil at the French Open. Tsonga eased past young American Denis Kudla 6-3 6-2. Hewitt, who has endured multiple hip operations, toppled Juan Martin del Potro 6-2, 2-6, 6-2. Del Potro, still learning the finer points of playing on grass, missed the French Open due to illness. ""I'm still hanging in there,"" the 32-year-old Hewitt said. ""The last four or five years have been tough with surgeries, but mentally I feel fresh."" As in Halle a back-to-back winner remains a possibility because Croatian Marin Cilic, the fifth seed, edged Berdych 7-5 7-6 (4). Cilic almost exited in the third round, trailing Feliciano Lopez 5-2 in the third set before staging a comeback.","Roger Federer doesn't lose a game against his quarterfinal opponent .

"(CNN) -- Monaco is famed for its glamorous Grand Prix, exclusive Casino's and mega-wealthy occupants. Now, the elite province is going to have an exclusive yacht club designed by one of the world's greatest living architects: Norman Foster. Foster is famed for buildings like London's famous skyscraper, the ""Gherkin"" and the restored Reichstag in Berlin, which houses the German parliament. The new building is intended to celebrate Monaco's distinctive coastline and nautical heritage. It will have a series of deck-styled viewing balconies that step up along the harbor providing views of yacht races and the course of the famous Formula 1 Grand Prix circuit. Situated on reclaimed land, the development will extend the city's existing marina eastwards and accommodate all sorts of craft, from small children's sailing boats to 100-meter superyachts. Energy supplies will be augmented by solar thermal panels as well as photovoltaics, while all the interior spaces will be air-conditioned using a low-energy, sea-cooled refrigeration system, the designers said. Glamour-seeking yacht enthusiasts will have to wait just a little bit longer, though, ""Yacht Club de Monaco"" is not expected to open until the summer of 2012.","British architects Norman Foster are behind glamorous new yacht club on Monaco harbor .

"(CNN) -- Australia's Marc Leishman and Sergio Garcia of Spain were the leaders after the first day of play at the Masters in Augusta. Garcia hit six birdies in his opening round to finish six under par with a round of 66, a benchmark which Leishman, who had gone out earlier, had already set. Tipped by many to win his first major since 2008, Tiger Woods shot a two-under 70, which is the same opening score as in three of his four victories at Augusta. ""It's a good start,"" Woods said. ""Some years some guys shot 65 starting out here, but right now I'm only four back and I'm right there. CURRENT LEADERBOARD . ""We've got a long way to go. You just go out there and play shot for shot."" In many ways though, the day belonged to 14-year-old Guan Tianlang. The Chinese schoolboy not only set the record as the youngest player to ever compete at the Masters, he then followed that up with a round of one-over par. Tianlang, who beat the previous record held by Italy's Matteo Manassero, who was nearly 17 when he set the previous mark in 2010, bogeyed his first but responded swiftly with a birdie at the third. He finished with a putt off the green that sunk into the hole at the 18th to earn applause and acclaim from spectators and fellow competitors. Meanwhile, Welshman Jamie Donaldson also earned himself a place in the Augusta record books after hitting a hole-in-one at the sixth, only the fifth player in the competition's 77-year history to achieve the feat. With a heavy thunderstorm expected overnight that will soften the greens, Woods warned ""the golf course is going to be very different"" on Friday. Elsewhere, three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson carded a one under par 71, while young Northern Irish star Rory McIlroy went round in 72. However defending champion Bubba Watson faces a uphill battle to defend his title after he struggled to a 75 -- leaving him nine strokes off the pace already.

"(CNN) -- Tina Maze rounded off her stellar season Sunday by doing what she does best -- winning. The 29-year-old overall World Cup champion recorded an unprecedented 24th podium finish of the season by claiming victory in the giant slalom at Lenzerheide, Switerland. Any disappointment at missing out on the downhill title to Lindsey Vonn was well and truly vanquished as Maze stormed to yet more success. The Slovenia star, who has already won the super-G and slalom crystal globes, is only the second skier ever to break the 2000 points barrier in the season. Her total of 2,414 points, a record, came after she clocked a time of two minutes 16.67 seconds over the two legs to finish ahead of France's Tessa Worley and home favorite Lara Gut. ""I have even impressed myself. It has been an incredible season, ""Maze told reporters. ""If someone had said to me before the start of the season I would achieve all this, I would have said they were mad,"" said Maze. ""I don't think that this is the fruit of just one year of hard work. ""One obviously requires talent and the need to work hard, but also to have a good team round oneself. Skiing is an individual sport, but there is a team around you to help you."" From the 900 points on offer for the Giant Slalom title, Maze collected 800 of them, winning on five occasions as well as finishing second three times and third once. She told the competition's official website: ""It's an incredible record, but I could have scored more points if the last Super G and Downhill weren't canceled. ""I'm impressed by all these achievements. It's been an amazing season for me. My skiing has been so good. I started with a win and finished with another one. ""That's the way to go when you're so strong. I'm so proud of me and my team. I also really would like to thank the fans for their great support."" In the men's race, Germany's Felix Neureuther claimed victory ahead of Marcel Hirscher and Ivica Kostelic. ""It's very good to go into the summer like that but I know I will need to work pretty hard too,"" Neureuther told the FIS website. ""Marcel was always the men to beat this season and I hope to do that more often next year. I'm so happy it's over now, my back hurts and I definitely feel like an old man needs some rest."" Austria's Hirscher, who had already secured the small globe for the slalom, claimed his ninth top three finish of the season to equal the all-time men's record for single-season World Cup slalom podiums. Only Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden in 1976/77 and Italy's Alberto Tomba in 1991/92 had previously managed the feat. ""It's amazing, it was quite difficult keeping the pace during the whole season but I am proud that I made nearly no mistakes,"" he told the competition's official website.

"(CNN) -- Seventeen-year-old American Mikaela Shiffrin produced a stunning second run to claim the women's slalom title at the World Ski Championships in Schladming, Austria on Saturday. The slalom princess, as Shiffrin has become known, was in third place after the first run but skied to the top of the podium with a rapid second, clocking an aggregate time of one minute 39.85 seconds, 0.22 ahead of Austria's Michaela Kirchgasser with Sweden's Frida Hansdotter finishing in third. ""It was crazy, there are so many emotions today. I thought I skied solid but probably not to my potential, my legs were tired,"" Shiffrin said. ""I was nervous up until I went out of the start ... but when I got in the start, I felt alive and ready to race,"" she added. The teenager from Vail, Colorado arrived at her first world world championships in top form. She won her first World Cup race in Sweden in December and followed it up with victories in Croatia and Austria last month. At 17 years, 340 days, Shiffrin is the youngest winner of the women's slalom world title since Liechtenstein's Hanni Wenzel in 1974. ""It's been a pretty amazing experience. I was thinking so many things. It was one of those times when everything was a blur and that's when you know it's good. I've been taking it day by day and right now I'm just taking it second by second."" Finland's Tanja Poutianen finished fourth while Slovakia's Tina Maze -- who took gold in the Super-G and silver in the Giant Slalom -- finished fifth. Shiffrin's victory is the U.S.'s fourth of the championships -- adding to Ted Ligety's wins in the Super-G, the Giant Slalom and the Super Combined -- and consolidates their place at the top of the medal's table with a total of four gold and one bronze.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Thorny issues of unbalanced trade, cyber security and intellectual property rights stand stark in the spotlight at this year's U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue now underway in Washington, D.C. Top officials from both sides, including co-chairs U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and China's State Councilor Yang Jiechi, have expressed tempered optimism for ""a new chapter"" in bilateral ties -- despite recent stumbles. The U.S. has slammed China on unfair subsidies on solar panels and the theft of secrets owned by U.S. technology companies. China has returned its own complaints -- most recently after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged Washington has been hacking Chinese computers. Yet leaders of both the U.S. and China -- the world's two largest economies -- know their nations are mutually dependent, especially on economy and foreign policy. Should either party try to distance itself from the other, the result would be mutually detrimental, analysts say. ""For the United States, the biggest issue is market access to China and making sure American companies have a level playing field,"" says Fred Neumann, HSBC Co-head of Asian Economics and Managing Director in Hong Kong. In March, the U.S. Commerce Department attempted to balance the field on the issue of solar panels. Washington slapped tariffs on Chinese-made panels in response to alleged subsidies by Beijing. Under the ruling, Chinese panels were hit with tariffs from 2.9% to 4.7%, echoing similar spats between China and Europe over solar panels and European wines. The biggest technological thorn in U.S.-China ties is ""the respect for intellectual property created by U.S. firms"" -- and lack thereof, says Chris Bronk, IT Policy Fellow at Rice University's James A. Baker Institute. This includes ""everything from pirated movies and software to R&D and corporate strategy documents"" because ""losses will cut into the capacity for additional development if the return on investment is insufficient."" In June, the U.S. Department of Justice charged one of China's biggest wind turbine makers, Sinovel, with stealing source codes from a U.S. competitor and manufacturing new machines. American Superconductor Corporation claims Sinovel's theft resulted in $800 million in losses. The United States loses some $300 billion each year mostly because of Chinese intellectual property theft, said former U.S. ambassador to China John Huntsman to CNN in June. In addition to IP theft, U.S.-China cyber security issues have come to the fore in the past month after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking hundreds of Chinese computers since at least 2009. China claimed Snowden's revelations would ""test developing Sino-US ties"" and exacerbate an already ""soured relationship"" on cybersecurity. Snowden's assertions, on top of alleged Chinese hacking of U.S. firms, depict a clear degree of mutual mistrust. The majority of headlines in China since then have referenced ""strain,"" ""tension,"" and even ""anger"" between the U.S. and China. The potential and ease for cyber attacks between the U.S. and China will continue to grow, says Andy Mok, managing director of Beijing-based Red Pagoda and former technology researcher for RAND Corporation. ""When every physical object has an IP address ... the return on malicious behavior becomes much higher. So on both sides -- China and the U.S. -- the targets are increasingly attractive."" National electrical grids and transportation networks are some of the most attractive marks in each country, adds Mok. ""That said, the sky is not falling and I don't believe we are weeks or months away from a cyberwar with China that will leave the U.S. power grid in tatters and the whole country sitting in the dark for months or years."" The chances of direct conflict are low, agree analysts. Economic, military, and technological disparity between the U.S. and China is too great. China is not ready for a clash to occur. And the U.S. -- still on the mend from the 2008 financial crisis -- is unlikely to instigate a conflict with China because of its own fiscal binds to China. Sentiment from top officials appeared to underline this. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told CNN's Fareed Zakaria China's pace toward market-oriented reforms ""will probably be slower than we would like"" but expects reforms to clearly proceed. Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang penned a positive editorial in the Washington Post hoping the U.S. and China would ""forge a more cooperative relationship. He noted that 70% of U.S. companies operating in China made a profit in 2012, the 1,500 McDonalds in China have outperformed outlets elsewhere in the world and a flight between the U.S. and China now takes off once every 24 minutes.","Top diplomatic, economic officials from U.S., China meet in Washington, D.C.

"(CNN) -- Most sporting winners like to achieve champion status by proving their worth in the heat of battle but Austria's Marcel Hirscher had the cold to thank after he was all but guaranteed a second straight overall World Cup in Switzerland on Thursday. A combination of snow, wind and fog caused the cancellation of Thursday's super G in Lenzerheide, just a day after the downhill was scrapped for similar reasons, all of which prompted Hirscher's chief rival Aksel Lund Svindal to withdraw from this weekend's slalom. The Norwegian had hoped to narrow Hirscher's lead of 149 points in the two events he excels in but Svindal's World Cup hopes became decidedly frosty after these were canceled - since the Austrian is more adroit at the slalom. ""I see no point in competing in the slalom now,"" said the overall champion in 2007 and 2009. ""It might have been a consideration had the two races not been canceled. But that has not been the case."" Svindal's decision to miss Sunday's season-ending slalom means he cannot overhaul Hirscher's lead, with only 100 points awarded to the winner of any race. Slalom is not his strong point, with the 30-year-old having never done better than finish sixth in a World cup race in the discipline. Disappointed by his failure to pits his wits on the slope, the speedy Svindal was nonetheless quick to praise Hirscher -- classifying the Austrian in the same bracket as some of the best skiers in history. ""He had a fantastic season, worthy of great skiers of the past like (Sweden's Ingemar) Stenmark or (Italy's Alberto) Tomba,"" added the Norwegian. Even though he was disappointed by the cancellation of Thursday's races, the move did confirm Svindal as the winner of this year's super G. The day went badly for organizers with an initial delay of over three hours for bad weather followed by another postponement after the first racer, Gauthier de Tessieres, fell in high winds. Nine racers managed to finish despite the gusting winds before Kroell, last year's downhill World Cup winner, crashed at the same spot as De Tessieres fell before being flown to hospital after 45 minutes of on course treatment for a broken shoulder. Hirscher told reporters it was difficult to celebrate his impending triumph on a day when his fellow Austrian, who received a tweet of support from his compatriot, had been so badly injured. ""Despite my young age, I've already learned many things. In life, being slalom world champion is not the most important thing,"" the 24-year-old said in philosophical fashion. ""There are things that surpass that -- such as my family, Laura (his girlfriend), my friends and being healthy."" Tina Maze was another left with mixed emotions, despite the fact that the Slovenian took her third crystal globe of the season on Thursday, adding the super G to the overall and giant slalom cups. This came just 24 hours after she lost out on the World Cup downhill crown to America's Lindsey Vonn in similar fashion, with bad fog canceling the race with the Slovenian trailing by just a single point. ""I don't really like this kind of days when you don't get the chance to show your skills on the slope,"" she told the official FIS website. ""But in the end today is a good day for me, while yesterday wasn't really. I'm of course happy to secure the Super G title. I'm really proud of my season."" ""I'm relieved that we didn't race today. Conditions were really tough. In my opinion speed events should be canceled before one o'clock.

"(CNN) -- My first visit to Augusta National was in 2005 when I was reporting for Ireland's national television channel RTE. As you can imagine, it was the realization of a lifelong dream. For the traveling circus of working media, there is an opportunity to place your name in a lottery, with the prize for the precious few who are chosen being a round at the course on the day after the Masters concludes. To get to play the course was always going to be a long shot, but I had decided to bring my clubs just in case. The draw is made on the Saturday of the tournament. If you're lucky to play, you are not allowed to enter the draw for another five years, so as to allow the fairest possible chance for those interested in teeing off on one of the world's truly iconic courses. For a first-timer, it was something akin to an out-of-body experience when I was presented with an official invitation to play. I could NOT believe it! The invitation is framed in our home alongside a 2005 Masters flag and a signed and marked scorecard. More of that anon. I was to tee off at 0730, starting at the 10th tee. Unbelievable. Literally 15 hours after the leaders Chris DiMarco and a certain Tiger Woods had graced the back nine in the tournament, so would I. Up early, grooves cleaned and excited beyond belief, I pitched up at the gates of Magnolia Lane and made my way up to the clubhouse to check in, meet my caddy Travis in his traditional white overalls and head to the practice range. My heart was pumping. I remember hitting a rocket off the tee with a hard draw and I still had a four iron to the green. The adrenaline, combined with a borderline hook, meant I bounced it over the back of the green into a bush. After a few rushed shots that confirmed my amateur status, a double bogey was recorded. We were off and running. All told, I enjoyed five double bogeys. And they were good doubles! The greens were unbelievable. The bumps and hollows, the scary reads -- we had them all and very early on I told myself to enjoy the experience, because this was not about the score, it was something to be savored. There were four of us: working press from all over the globe suddenly possessing the wide-eyed stare of excited children, with a glorious invitation to the pristine fairways of Augusta National -- living out our fantasies of actually playing the course. I remember playing the 16th and three-putting for a bogey. What they tell you about placing the ball in the correct position below the holes is absolutely true. On this and so many of the greens, there are impossible putts if you don't play the correct approach shot. What was utterly fascinating was the opportunity to have a go at playing Tiger Woods' chip shot at 16 from the previous day, which is arguably the greatest shot in modern times at Augusta. Let me confirm, not that it is necessary, that the shot was impossible for mere mortals like myself. The vision to play that shot -- which helped Woods win his fourth Green Jacket -- and the ability to execute it with such perfection was God-like. In the end, I carded eight pars, five bogeys and those five doubles. A round of 87 of which I'm proud. We played from the members tees, as instructed, but I confess to playing on the Masters tees on all of the par-threes. There were so many wonderful experiences that day, as I savored the experience and stood in spots where so many iconic shots have been been struck down through the years. You'll always remember your first time, and for me, it was a day that I will never, ever forget.","Augusta National opened in 1933 and first hosted the Masters the following year .

"(CNN) -- The relationship between sporting greats and great venues and events is often complicated. Usain Bolt thrives at the Olympics. But Sachin Tendulkar never scored a century at the home of cricket Lord's while the clay courts at the French Open blunted the talent of tennis legend Pete Sampras. In downhill skiing, though, the man widely considered the best ever had few relationship issues with the mountain all in his sport want to conquer. Franz Klammer won five overall downhill World Cup titles. At one stage he was so dominant he won 11 races in a row. And at downhill's most famous and feared slope, the Streif, on the Hahnenkamm mountain in Kitzbuhel, he came down the quickest four times. The Streif means strip or stripe. Its combination of blind turns and varying gradients make it the hardest and scariest out there. ""The first time when I came here and I saw the downhill I said: 'I'm not doing this, these guys are crazy, they are just nuts',"" Klammer told CNN's Alpine Edge. 'It is the most difficult and daring downhill on the whole circuit. That's why its such a good race. If you are a good downhiller you've got to win Kitzbuhel."" By the sound of it, Austrian ace Klammer knows every nook and cranny of the course so well it is as if he could ski the course blind. ""You have no time to get into the race. ""If you compare it to Wengen, there you start with a few gentle turns. ""On the Streif you accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers an hour in just three seconds."" And just five seconds after the start you hit the ""mousetrap"", a blind jump where the racers pick their line from trees on the other side of the valley. ""The first time I did it I thought I couldn't make it. I tried it and I was going very awkwardly and I did it and I thought wow! And then it became my favorite part of the course,"" recalls Klammer. ""Then you have the Steilhang -- which translates as steep rock slope -- it's the most difficult turn. It's a left hanging turn which traverses a hill leaning the other way and you have to carry all your speed through it to the flat bit next. ""If you have no speed there you're done. You can drink your beer half way down,"" adds Klammer with a chuckle. And well might he laugh. He did win here four times, a record only broken last year by Switzerland's Didier Cuche. ""The first was very special because I had won all my races up to Kitzbuhel. It would be my fifth victory, which would tie the record for wins in one season. ""I had a crash in the training run, so was a little injured. Everything went wrong, but still I won the race, and went on to win the next and set a new record."" For his first victory in 1975 he was the hot favorite. Not so in 1984. ""I didn't win Kitzbuhel for seven years. I couldn't believe it, this is my downhill and I couldn't win it any more. What's happened? ""And then I was in the starting gate in 1984 and I knew I was going to win this race. No matter what. I was going for it."" Klammer is back in Kitzbuhel where this weekend the latest generation tackle the slope which has staged races since 1931. In a sport where the talk now is all of preparation, his advice is a little surprising. ""I know exactly where I want to ski but usually I am not where I want to ski! ""The big thing you have to be able to do is improvise, not stick to your line. If you stick to your line, most likely you are going to be very slow. You just let it go. And then sometime you are 10 meters off your line and you just have to go on from there."" It was this ability to think on his skis that secured his most famous non-Hahnenkamm victory at the Olympic Games in 1976 in front of a ecstatic home crowd in Innsbruck. He was the last man to go in the final and the hopes of a nation rested on his shoulders. ""Halfway down I looked at the crowd and they were cheering but not that enthusiastically, and I thought I better do something, better change something, otherwise I will not win the race. ""So I changed totally the line, and went all the way up to a fence on a big right hander. I hadn't even inspected up there. I was skiing right on the edge."" It seems the most famous races of them all really are won not beforehand, but in the 100-odd seconds it takes to get to the bottom.","Austrian skiing legend Franz Klammer was a Hahnenkaam specialist .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City have given another signal of their intent to wrest the English Premier League title back from neighbors Manchester United with the signing of Brazilian Fernandinho. The midfielder has joined the 2012 champions from Shakhtar Donetsk for a reported fee of Â£30 million ($48m). Fernandinho, 28, has five caps for his country and has played in the last eight European Champions League campaigns for the Ukrainian club. He told City's official club website: ""This is a change, a challenge and a chance that I have been waiting a long time for. Playing in the Premier League is like a dream. ""My ambition here is to win all the titles, the team here is strong, and so is the greatness of the club and the supporters. ""Professionally this is a spectacular thing. Playing for a huge club in a huge league makes me so happy. I hope I will be able to repay City for what they have done for me. ""I know I will face challenges but I am prepared for them. Every player at a high level faces pressure and must respond and I am ready for that too. I know a lot about City. ""Ever since they expressed an interest in me, I have been learning more."" Fernandinho was an integral part of the Shakhtar side that won the 2009 UEFA Cup, and he also helped them to the quarterfinals of the Champions League in the 2010/11 season. He won six Ukrainian league titles with the club and four Ukrainian cup crowns. His last cap for Brazil came in a friendly with Bosnia and Herzegovina back in February 2012 but he has not featured under new national team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. City finished a distant second to Manchester United in the race for the Premier League title and the club sacked manager Roberto Mancini last month. Former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini is expected to take over at the club after he left Malaga at the end of the Spanish season. City are also expected to tie up the signing of Spain international Jesus Navas in the coming days. The Sevilla winger was quoted as saying the Spanish press that his move was imminent. He said: ""It's a good project and it was the moment to make the step. It was my choice. I'm very happy with the decision. We've been talking with Manchester City for four months. ""The Premier League is a competition where the football is very fast. I'm really looking forward to it.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy says he is happy to go into next month's Masters ""under the radar"" after losing his world No. 1 spot to Tiger Woods. McIlroy's form slump since switching to Nike equipment this year in a reported $250 million deal had been the major talking point in the golf season so far, but Woods' resurgence has eclipsed that. The 23-year-old congratulated the American 14-time major winner with a text message after Woods regained top spot with victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, Florida on Sunday -- his third tournament win this year. McIlroy told reporters ahead of this week's Houston Open that Woods texted back to tell his young Northern Irish rival to ""pull his finger out"" and raise his game. However, McIlroy suggested that maybe he can perform better as he chases his first Masters title in two weeks' time if he is not favored to win at Augusta. ""I didn't think I could go into the Masters under the radar,"" McIlroy, a winner of two major championships, told the PGA Tour website. ""I can go in a little bit underneath him. ""So in a way it's not a bad thing (to lose the top ranking)."" McIlroy enhanced his growing reputation last season, becoming world No. 1 with victory at the PGA Tour's Honda Classic at Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in March before winning a second major at Kiawah Island, host of the 2012 PGA Championship in August. One year later McIlroy is battling to regain that momentum. He apologized after walking out of the defense of his Honda Classic crown earlier this month after a disastrous start to the second round, and has he is yet to win a tournament in 2013 -- though he showed promising form in the final round of the subsequent WGC-Cadillac Championship event that Woods won. Last week, instead of entering the fray with Woods at Bay Hill, McIlroy spent the weekend on the sidelines watching his tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki compete in the WTA tournament in Miami. ""People left me alone, it was fine,"" McIlroy said. ""It's nice to just go about my business and no-one cares, to not be the most talked about person in golf. ""We're not machines, we're humans. You're going to have patches where you play great and have patches where you struggle a little bit. ""I guess you've just got to take the rough and the smooth, and play and be patient and know that you're working on the right things."" McIlroy aims to get back in the swing -- and respond to the gauntlet thrown down by Woods at the Houston Open, where he could return to the No. 1 ranking with victory. ""I want to get back to getting into contention in tournaments and trying to win,"" he said. ""I think this is a good week to try and get into contention -- you have a chance with the Masters coming up.'' Woods is not playing this week, but they will reunite at Augusta when the American tees up for his tilt at a fifth Masters title -- and his first major win since 2008. ""(Tiger has) been the man in golf for the last 15 years, and it's great for golf to have him play well,"" McIlroy said. ""And, you, know, hopefully, I can try to keep up with him.''","Rory McIlroy says losing his No. 1 spot to Tiger Woods could help him return to form .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When the 10th London Palestine Film Festival opens this week, Londoners will have greater access to films made in the Palestinian territories than many people living in the region. Palestinian director Annemarie Jacir's first feature film, ""Salt of This Sea,"" premiered at Cannes Film Festival in 2008. Today, there is only one movie theater operating in the West Bank. Gaza has none. The ""Al Kasaba"" theater in Ramallah is the only formal film venue for a population of nearly 2.5 million in the West Bank. Due to travel restrictions it is virtually inaccessible to the one and one half million Palestinians residing in Gaza. It is estimated that about 80 percent of Palestinian children have never been to a movie theater, according to a report in The Christian Science Monitor. With this lack of distribution, and hardly any formal funding available, producing a film within the Palestinian territories is a tremendous challenge. Against the odds, the region's filmmakers completed three feature films and an estimated eight shorts in 2008 -- more than ever before. Local directors are determined to tell their stories and have adapted to cope with the region's difficult circumstances. Lack of cinematic infrastructure . One of the greatest obstacles filmmakers face is a lack of equipment and crews. According to industry experts, directors in the Palestinian territories have little hope of competing with international news media over the limited resources. ""Crews who can work for international news organizations at very high salaries don't want to work for independent film makers,"" says director and coordinator of the Shashat's Women's Film Festival, Alia Arasoughly. Are you interested in seeing more films made by Palestinian directors? Tell us below in the SoundOff box below . ""They don't want to rent their equipment out for a 10-hour shooting day, when they can rent it out for just two hours and triple the price to an international crew."" As a consequence of this, filmmakers are looking to local residents for production assistance. Annemarie Jacir's first feature film,""Salt of This Sea,"" which premiered last year at Cannes Film Festival, tells the story of an American woman who travels to Israel to visit the land where her grandfather lived before Palestinians were ejected in 1948. The film was shot with a crew consisting largely of novices assembled by the director, including a former ambulance driver, a jeweler and a radio DJ. ""There were always discussions with my producers, who preferred bringing more experienced professional people from Europe in, and I insisted that I'd rather have locals even if they're less experienced,"" Jacir told CNN. ""We're trying to build something in [the Palestinian territories], and when things got tough, because they believed in what we were doing, they stayed."" During the shoot Jacir's team also received unexpected support from members of the local community, who brought them food and drinks in between takes. ""We even had the entire Palestinian police force blocking traffic; going out of their way to help us,"" remembers Jacir. Restricted Mobility . A further complication faced by Jacir and her colleagues is the limitation on movement and access in the Palestinian territories. Since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, Israeli authorities have imposed varying degrees of restriction on the movement of people in and out of the territories, according to human rights group, Amnesty International. In 2007, the year in which Jacir shot the majority of her film, Amnesty reported 84 manned checkpoints and 465 unmanned blockades within the West Bank alone. As a result of these security measures, which the Israelis say are necessary to secure their country from Palestinian attacks, the production of ""Salt of This Sea,"" a movie with over 80 shooting locations was logistically very complex. In order to shoot the road movie lawfully, Jacir and her crew had to apply for permission to leave Ramallah. ""Every single crew member was rejected. So, just purely getting through the checkpoints and the logistics of keeping a film crew together was an obstacle."" Obtaining shooting permission was equally problematic. Permits for various locations including Jaffa were refused repeatedly -- a hindrance which did not deter Jacir. ""In some cases we just filmed anyway. We put the actors in a real situation and we just did it guerrilla-style. That's how most Palestinian filmmakers are managing to do their work,"" she told CNN. A bright future? While drawbacks such as a lack of funding, a lack of resources, and restrictions of movement would dissuade directors in many other countries, members of the growing film community in the Palestinian territories are forging bonds over the difficulties. While Arasoughly and Jacir agree that it would be going too far to speak of a ""national cinema"" at this stage, they look to the future with great optimism. The novice crew members Jacir recruited to work on ""Salt of This Sea"" have continued to find work in filmmaking -- a fact Jacir believes indicates an industry is gradually starting to emerge. ""I think there's a wave coming -- a lot of new filmmakers, a lot of people making documentaries and more experimental films, working together,"" Jacir told CNN. Arasoughly, whose Shashat festival will enter its fifth year this fall, is equally hopeful. ""The fact that we, under the harshest of conditions in the Arab world, have been able to hold an annual women's film festival, and that hundreds of students come to our screenings means that people want their worlds to be expanded,"" she said. ""They want wider horizons, and I think for me, this is what makes it possible to go on in the context that we live in.""","More films were made in the Palestinian territories in 2008 then ever before .

"(CNN) -- Legendary Brazilian footballer Pele believes Jose Mourinho's return to Chelsea will benefit the London club but he has warned there is no guarantee the Portuguese can deliver success. Mourinho made his long-awaited return to Stamford Bridge on Monday, after cutting short a three-year tenure at Real Madrid despite having another three years left on his contract. The 50-year-old won the 2012 league title with the Spanish giants, and the Copa del Rey the year before, but failed in the club's primary objective -- to win a 10th European crown. The relative lack of success in the Champions League, where Mourinho guided Real to the semifinals in each of his three seasons, may underpin Pele's comments about his reappointment at the home of the 2012 European titleholders. ""Mourinho's return is good for Chelsea because he's a good coach,"" Pele told CNN's World Sport. ""He is talented and very honest. I know him personally. But football is a box of surprises. ""He has to have a bit of luck because in football, sometimes the best doesn't work. I wish him good luck."" During his first stint in charge of Chelsea from 2004-2007, Mourinho delivered the club's first English title in half a century before adding another Premier League crown, an FA Cup and two League Cups as well. While he was away, the former Porto manager won his second Champions League with Inter Milan in 2010, a year when he won the league title for the second time with the Italian club. Desperate to win the Champions League for the first time since 2002, Real Madrid turned to Mourinho just days after he ended Inter Milan's barren 35-year run in the competition. But even with the goalscoring ability of star player Cristiano Ronaldo, the semis proved an insurmountable barrier as successive exits at the hands of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund followed. Mourinho's relationship with his compatriot Ronaldo broke down towards the end of his Madrid reign and the coach explained why in typically outspoken fashion during an interview broadcast by popular Spanish football show ""Punto Pelota"" on Tuesday. ""I had only one problem with him -- very simple, very basic -- which was when a coach criticizes a player from a tactical viewpoint, trying to improve what in my view could have been improved,"" he said. ""And at that moment he didn't take it very well because maybe he thinks he knows everything and the coach cannot help him to develop more."" While Ronaldo's future at Real Madrid has been the subject of recent debate, the endless speculation is finally over about where a Brazilian youngster who is often compared to Pele will end up. Neymar, 21, signed a five-year deal with Real's great rivals Barcelona this week, leaving behind the very club where Pele made his name from 1956-1974: Santos. After winning numerous titles with the club, including the 2011 Copa Libertadores, Neymar has often been labeled ""the next Pele"" but the man himself -- still the only player to have won the World Cup on three separate occasions -- refuses to make such a comparison. ""To be the new Pele would be very difficult, because my mother and my father closed the machine,"" joked the 72-year-old, who lifted the Jules Rimet trophy in 1958, 1962 and 1970. ""But no doubt he is one of the best players we have in Brazil."" ""Of course in Brazil we have a lot of excellent players like Zico, Tostao, Rivelino, Pele, Ronaldinho, but the last two years we have Neymar, who is very talented. ""I hope he has luck in Barcelona. I didn't like it so much because he used to play in my team, Santos. I lost a good player. But it's important to understand that he deserves to go to the best team.""","Pele believes Jose Mourinho's return to Chelsea is good for the English Premier League club .

"(CNN) -- Jaycee Dugard filed a complaint against the federal government Thursday, seeking compensation for what she called its failures to track the man who held her captive for 18 years. The lawsuit was filed Thursday morning in the U.S. District Court for Northern California. This comes after the U.S. government ""summarily rejected"" two requests from Dugard ""for private mediation in the case,"" according to a press release from Nancy Seltzer and Associates, a Los Angeles-based public relations firm that represents the long-time kidnap victim. The U.S. Justice Department had no immediate comment Thursday, as it had not seen and thus did not know the details of the complaint, said spokesman Charles Miller. Dugard was 11 years old in 1991, when she was abducted from the street in front of her South Lake Tahoe, California, home. Phillip and Nancy Garrido held her and the two daughters she gave birth to in subsequent years in a hidden compound of sheds and tarpaulins until they were found in 2009. Phillip Garrido was convicted in the 1970s of kidnapping a 25-year-old woman and keeping her in a storage shed in Reno, Nevada, where he repeatedly raped her. He spent 11 years of his sentence in a Leavenworth, Kansas, federal penitentiary, then went to a halfway house and eventually was allowed to live with his mother at her Antioch, California, home. The federal government oversaw Phillip Garrido's parole from when he got out of custody in 1988 through 1999 -- including the date in 1991 when Dugard was kidnapped -- after which responsibility shifted to California authorities. ""For nearly the entirety of their lives, ... Dugard and her two daughters were held captive, abused and irreparably damaged by a deranged and maniacal felon, Phillip Garrido,"" the complaint begins. The court document sharply criticizes the federal government for releasing Phillip Garrido originally from prison in 1988 as well for what it calls its ""outrageous and inexcusable"" handling of his case. ""Had federal parole authorities demonstrated a modicum of vigilance -- indeed, had they simply performed their duties and obligations as required by federal law and internal policies -- Jaycee and her daughters would not have been forced to endure a virtual lifetime of physical and mental abuse from a detonated 'time bomb,'"" the complaint states. No specific damages are requested in the complaint, and Dugard ""is not seeking money for herself"" -- as any funds would go to her non-profit The JAYC Foundation, which gives support and services to families recovering from abductions and other traumatic services -- said the press release. ""We believe that the years of abuse experienced by Ms. Dugard are a direct result of the U.S. parole commission's colossal blunders in the supervision of Mr. Garrido,"" Dale Kinsella, part of the law firm of Kinsella, Weitzman, Iser, Kump and Aldisert, which filed the complaint on behalf of Dugard, said in a statement. A $20 million settlement was paid out in 2010 from the state of California. The press release on Dugard's behalf notes those funds were shared between her and her children, as well as used for legal and other expenses. Moreover, it states ""the two governmental entities"" -- meaning the state and federal governments -- ""committed separate, distinct and consecutive acts of negligence."" This past April, the Garridos pleaded guilty in El Dorado Superior Court. A judge sentenced Phillip Garrido to 431 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and 12 counts of sexual assault. Nancy Garrido got 36 years to life in prison for her role in the crimes, including kidnapping and one count of rape by force. A few months later, in July, James Ware -- the chief federal judge for northern California, thus putting him in charge of the probation department there -- released a once-confidential report from the Administrative Office of the United States Court on Garrido's case. It found no evidence that federal officers charged with overseeing Garrido over the years would have found Dugard by searching the premises. Still, the report called the handling of his case ""clearly substandard"" and symptomatic of larger problems. ""The Garrido case is a significant reflection of the deficient practices in the probation office in the northern district of California,"" the report said. ""The office had a track record of inadequate supervision (and) serious deficiences in operations."" After arriving in Antioch, Garrido was ""correctly categorized as a 'high risk' offender, (but) the probation office failed to supervise him accordingly."" The Administration Office said the case's poor management was unsurprising, as the same federal agency had concluded in 2000 that the northern California probation office's supervision of sex offenders was ""poor.""

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton claimed his first victory since switching to Mercedes and revived his world title hopes with a storming drive at the Hungarian Grand Prix Sunday. The 28-year-old Briton made full use of his pole position to finish ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for Lotus and triple world champion Sebastian Vettel. Red Bull's Vettel increases his lead in the title race to 38 points after Fernando Alonso could only claim fifth in his Ferrari. The ever-consistent Raikkonen has moved into second spot, one point ahead of Alonso with Hamilton in fourth, still 48 points adrift of leader Vettel. But he will be heartened by a famous victory, with the Mercedes at last being able to capitalize on their qualifying superiority. Fearing hot conditions and tire wear, Hamilton had expressed the opinion it would be a ""miracle"" if he was able to take the checkered flag, but in the reality his 22nd career win was almost untroubled, finishing 11 seconds ahead of Raikkonen. ""Brilliant job Lewis, fantastic drive,"" Hamilton's team told him over his race radio after the 2008 world champion ended a ten race winless streak. It was his fourth win at the Hungaroring near Budapest, repeating his 2012 triumph with McLaren. Hamilton acknowledged how crucial the victory was at the halfway stage of a season to date largely dominated by Vettel in his Red Bull. ""I think this is probably one of the most important Grand Prix wins of my career,"" he said. ""We have got to work hard but if we can come here and make our tires last we should be able to do it anywhere,"" he added. Australia's Mark Webber took fourth in the second Red Bull ahead of two-time champion Alonso, with Romain Grosjean sixth for Lotus after another incident packed drive by the Frenchman. Britain's Jenson Button was seventh for the improving McLaren team with Brazilian Felipe Massa in the second Ferrari taking eighth. Mexican Sergio Perez in the second McLaren and Pastor Maldonado of Venezuela rounded out the points scoring. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg went off near the finish while in ninth place so Red Bull increase their advantage in the race for the constructors' title.","Lewis Hamilton wins Hungarian Grand Prix to boost title hopes .

"(CNN) -- New York Yankees superstar Alex Rodriguez denies any plea negotiations with Major League Baseball for alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs, he told CNN's Jason Carroll this week. ""Well, I don't think there's anything that's going on right now, and that's as far as I'm going to take it,"" Rodriguez said. ""I think it's important that we have a process. I think we have a good system with Major League Baseball. And let's let the process play out."" Rodriguez spoke with CNN Tuesday on the eve of his pending return to the Yankees lineup after off-season surgery. He talked of his love for the game that's been ""the greatest gift"" and how he needs his fans more than ever as he turns 38 this month. Rodriguez's representatives have reportedly been negotiating a deal with the league to reduce a possible 100-game suspension for alleged performance-enhancing drug use, according to some media accounts. Those allegations claim Rodriguez had ties with the now-closed anti-aging Biogenesis clinic in Florida and its founder, Anthony Bosch. Rodriguez is one of some 20 players who could face suspension as a result of the scandal. But Rodriguez declined to address whether he would fight a long suspension or other adverse decision if one is so issued by the Yankees or the league. ""You know, I'd just rather not get into any of that right now. It's premature, and we'll let the process play out. That's my responsibility right now,"" Rodriguez said. Opinion: The worst sports contract ever . Such a roiling controversy would be hard on any athlete's concentration, and if the speculation of a possible career-ending suspension is making life more difficult for Rodriguez -- who's still working his way back into the Yankees lineup after off-season surgery -- he isn't directly saying so. What Rodriguez does acknowledge is that he needs to connect better with his fans in what could be the final chapters of his playing career. Rodriguez is regarded by some as the greatest slugger in baseball or the greatest third-baseman, but here's something no one can dispute: He holds the largest contract ever in American sports, signed with the Yankees in 2007 awarding him $275 million over 10 years. Critics, however, say it's the worst contract ever because of problems with his health and on-field performance. A-Rod denies performance-enhancing drugs reports . Today, Rodriguez admits he doesn't have many years left on the diamond: He turns 38 on July 27, and he is now testing his recovery from hip surgery in January by playing in the minor leagues. The three-time American League MVP described the operation as ""definitely the hardest surgery I've had to overcome."" ""Look, there's no hiding it. I'm not a spring chicken anymore. I'm not 28. I'm going to be 38 here in July. But I do think I can contribute,"" Rodriguez said. ""I think I can be a force in the middle lineup, a big right-handed bat for our team, but I'm at a different stage of my career. Is it realistic to go out and hit 40, 50 home runs? I don't think so. But can I go out and have nights like I did last night and do that several times a week? I think so."" Opinion: Baseball, this time throw the book at users of performance-enhancing drugs . Rodriguez was referring to his home run in a minor league game in which he went 2-for-4 this week, fueling optimism he could return to the majors possibly next week. He's been 5-for-28 at the plate in the minors. ""It felt incredible,"" he said of the two-run homer. ""I haven't hit a ball like that in over a year."" He's determined to return to Yankee Stadium and won't entertain questions about potential disappointments. ""I'm going to focus on the positive,"" Rodriguez said. ""I feel like I owe the Yankee fan base my A-game. I don't think they had that last year. I went in, I got fixed up, I worked my butt off. And I can't wait to get back in New York and help my team win."" The Yankees' web site reports that Rodriguez expects to be back with the team Monday. Rodriguez also wants to better engage his fans. He acknowledged how he doesn't grant many one-on-one interviews. ""I've taken the approach of 'less is more,' "" he said. ""And I've always tried to let my game do the talking. But I think over the last year or so, I've wanted to share more with my fan base. I think that's important. And I'm in a different stage of my career now. I just want to be able to communicate with my fan base. ""First of all, I'd like to thank them for their support. Their support has been overwhelming and it's fueled me,"" he continued. ""This has been a very difficult process, and I'm just humbled by the opportunity to play baseball. I love this game so much. My father played baseball. That's what I know to do. That's my gift. God has given me the greatest gift. And that's what I love to do."" This year's hip surgery was his second -- ""almost triple the size of the one I had in '09,"" he said. ""It was an extensive surgery. They shaved quite a bit off my left labrum, and they put in five anchors,"" he said. Despite the injury, he maintains the enthusiasm of ""a 10-year-old boy out there playing,"" he says. He wants to return to the Yankees pinstripes to solidify his legacy as ""someone that loved that game and someone that respected that game and someone that loves teammates, and loves to compete,"" he said. ""The one thing that no one can take away from me is that the effort that I put forth and how much I love this game,"" he said. MLB sues Florida clinic linked to supplying players with PEDs .

"(CNN) -- Slovakian Peter Sagan made up for a series of near misses to claim his first stage win on this year's Tour de France in Albi Friday. He burst clear after 205.5km from Montepellier to win easily from Germany's John Degenkolb (Argos Shimano) and Italian Daniele Bennati (Saxo-Tinkoff). South African Daryl Impey held on to the race leader's yellow jersey after claiming it the previous day from Orica-GreenEdge teammate Simon Gerrans of Australia. Sagan, who has already taken a stranglehold on the green points jersey he won for the first time in last year's Tour, has been denied victory on four previous stages, but made no mistake this time after superb work from his Cannondale team. They pushed on after the second of the day's climb which left other star sprinters such as Mark Cavendish of Britain and Germany's Andre Greipel, winner of stage six, trailing. They came home in an 84-strong group nearly 15 minutes down, leaving Sagan to pay his compliments to his helpers. ""This was a show of how strong we are as a team,"" he told the official Tour de France website. ""Even if it's not an ideal stage for me, I'll keep on trying. ""We did a lot of work on the second climb and we dropped the sprinters and the team started to believe that we could do well."" Impey, the first South African to don the yellow jersey, admitted it had been tough to hold on to it. ""There was a moment on the second climb that the pressure was on, but we handled it pretty well,"" he said. ""But I was happy to see the top of that climb, that's for sure."" Sagan now has a lead of over 100 points in the battle for green, but Saturday will see the race for yellow hot up as the peloton hit the Pyrenees for the first time in the eighth stage over 195km from Castres to Ax 3 Domaines. Impey is expected to cede the jersey as race favorites such as Chris Froome and Alberto Contador make their bid for overall domination in the mountains.","Peter Sagan wins seventh stage of Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Amid the roar of the engines, the screech of the tires and the cacophony of the crowd, they diligently and silently go about their work. In a sport where safety is paramount, if it wasn't for them the Formula One circus would come to an abrupt halt. ""I don't like the word heroes,"" Pete Berry, the man in charge of the marshals who will line the track at this weekend's British Grand Prix, told CNN. ""But when marshals give of their time freely to make motorsport successful, to make sure it's safe for the drivers, the last thing on your mind is that you may be seriously injured -- or you may not go home."" The role of these volunteer men and women has been put sharply into the focus by the recent death of marshal Mark Robinson, who was killed after falling under a crane in the immediate aftermath of the last race in Canada. Marshaling is a dangerous hobby and feelings among its global community are still raw after the tragedy in Montreal. ""For one of our own to be involved in a fatal accident is truly shocking,"" explained Berry, who has been on duty at every British round of the F1 world championship since 1981. ""Any incident like that, wherever it is in the world, is something we feel personally. ""At the first race meeting that took place at the Silverstone circuit the week after Canada, many of the marshals came in and wanted to do something as a mark of respect. ""We observed a minute's silence trackside as a sign of unity in memory of our colleague. We all felt it very strongly."" There will be close to 1200 men and women volunteer marshals at Silverstone, the legendary circuit in the heart of England that is the home of the British Grand Prix and which staged the first-ever F1 world championship race in 1950. Despite the reverberations of the accident in Canada, Berry says it will be business as usual for the marshals as they ensure the world's fastest cars and drivers race safely. ""I don't think there is anything procedurally we are going to change,"" said Berry. ""We will be extra aware -- but at the end of the day what we do is dangerous. ""Racing drivers understand the consequences of what they're doing and so do marshals."" There is, of course, one obvious difference between those in the cockpit and those waving flags to communicate messages to the drivers, working in the hum of the pit lane, or waiting trackside for a gap in the traffic before leaping across the barriers to remove a dangerous piece of debris from the circuit -- money. While Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton is F1's highest earner, reputedly commanding an annual salary of $31m with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso taking home $26m, the marshals are unpaid for the work that they do. They do not even receive expenses for spending a long weekend away from home. Instead the British race organizers give them one free guest pass, a commemorative baseball cap, free on-site camping and a voucher towards lunch. The marshals -- many of them fresh from their day jobs -- arrive for ""work"" at the British GP at 6am and are on duty for the next 13 hours. Despite the time and expense involved -- not to mention the danger -- Berry argues that if marshals were paid their sense of responsibility would diminish. ""There is no room for people who are there for the money and who don't give a damn,"" he explained. ""When someone steps out from the barriers they are at risk and you want people who are protecting each other's back, who understand the job and who aren't scared of the equipment. ""People who turn up for money are not going to be the people you can trust your life with."" Marshaling may not be for everyone but for those working in Britain, and at the other 18 grands prix around the world this season, the rewards would seem to outweigh the costs. ""You get very close to the sport, that's one of the things I love about it,"" explained Peter Greenlagh, standing, unruffled by the brisk, British breeze, at the famous sweeping curves of Maggotts and Becketts at Silverstone. ""You're not just close to the cars, you're involved with them and you're making sure these drivers carry on driving safely. ""If something happens it happens very, very quickly -- at about 160 mph. Once you step out from behind the barriers, the adrenalin does start to pump around the body. ""You do think 'This is a dangerous hobby.' It's slightly mad!' ""But there is a great camaraderie, we have good fun together and we're all 'expert' drivers of course!"" Many who try a marshaling taster day and choose to go through the required training quickly find themselves in it for the long-haul. Bob Tripkovic has been volunteering since 1967 and when it comes to watching the generations of F1 drivers climb up the ranks, he has had the best seat in the house -- Silverstone's only permanent recovery vehicle. ""All the big names have ended up in the back of the truck,"" recalled Tripkovic. ""The Sennas -- Ayrton and Bruno -- Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell. I've brought in grandsons of drivers who had broken down in the Sixties! ""We meet the drivers at the worst time [when they have crashed] but some of them are still very personable. ""I've done this in a voluntary capacity for years and years and years. I've hogged this seat for a very long time -- I expect some of the other marshals are waiting for me to retire."" When the F1 world championship began, marshals came from the ranks of various racing clubs. They could not afford to race in grands prix and so chose to still play a part in races by acting as marshals. Today the marshals come to race tracks around the world from all walks of life and without them giving up their free time, whatever the costs, the wheels of Formula One simply could not keep turning. The Silverstone circuit in the UK is always looking for new race marshals for all its race meetings. Those interested should contact the circuit.","F1 returns at the British Grand Prix on 30 June following the death of a marshal in Montreal .

"(CNN) -- European football's summer months are dominated by back-page headlines of glamorous transfers involving the game's most prestigious players, with Arsenal's Robin van Persie the most notable example this last few weeks as he ponders whether to stay with the London club after saying he will not renew his contract. But at the bottom of the football pyramid -- a world that receives little attention from the global media -- there are many deals that involve young players who are just starting their careers, the clubs that have trained them, and those that are interested in signing them in the hope that they might be the next Lionel Messi. The story of Messi's early years in Argentina and his signing by Barcelona has been retold countless times. Of how, diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, the kid who would become the world's best player went to Spain after Barcelona offered to pay his medical bills. What is less well known is that Barcelona did not immediately pay his former club Newell's Old Boys the training compensation fee that the Argentine team was due. Can PSG's big bucks buy world domination? Newell's Old Boys did claim $42,867 in reparation, but had to go all the way to FIFA's Dispute Resolution Chamber to get the payment. It takes time and money for clubs to develop players, but the rewards can be enormous given the voracious appetite of ambitious teams looking for new talent. But this talent trawl leaves casualties and an academic study in 2009 estimated as many as 20,000 African boys are living in the streets of Europe after failing to secure contracts with European clubs following their trials. Under rules established by football's international governing body FIFA, those clubs seeking that new talent agree to pay the team that nurtured the youngster a ""training compensation"" fee. FIFA has a cash formula that is designed to compensate the ""training club"" for the years spent developing players up to the age of 23, when they sign their first professional contract. However, sports agent Paulo Teixeira says some European teams do not always play ball in agreeing these compensation fees. Teixeira, who has worked as a player agent and once represented former Brazil international Roberto Carlos, has taken to posting about training compensation on Facebook., pointing to the way social media was used during the Arab Spring as a motivation in raising publicity over the issue. ""It's a matter of culture,"" Teixeira writes on Facebook, recounting what he says he was told by an executive of a European team ahead of the Champions League final in Munich back in May. ""European clubs are ready to pay millions on transfer fees, but when it comes to settling training compensation to African or South Americans clubs, it becomes a problem. ""Clubs know that they will have to pay once the cases reach FIFA, but until then they buy time."" The Brazilian agent is football's equivalent of a bounty hunter, taking a hefty commission from the teams he represents in cases he takes before FIFA to claim training compensation from larger clubs. Teixeira details his disputes with a number of those European clubs on Facebook, claiming they failed to pay the true cost of training a player to the development club, based on FIFA's formula. Unhappy about these Facebook postings, at least two of those clubs -- Italy's AC Milan and Anderlecht of Belgium -- have complained to FIFA about what they claim is ""defamation and calumny"". ""FIFA can confirm that AC Milan and Anderlecht have lodged complaints against the agent Paulo Teixeira and that FIFA has opened a case,"" FIFA told CNN. ""However, as the investigations are currently ongoing we cannot comment or speculate at this stage."" But as well referencing the Arab Spring, Teixeira quotes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- ""everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression"" -- as justification for his campaign. In one of the cases Teixeira posts about, he claims AC Milan owes Botafogo FC of Ribeirao Preto compensation involving its training of the player Sergio Ceregatti. He says the claim is based on the calculation that Ceregatti was with the Brazilian club for four years before moving to Italy. Ceregatti initially joined Ancona and then signed for Milan, with Botafogo not compensated for those formative years of training as per FIFA's rules. ""At this stage, I just can tell you that the player gave three different declarations (one of them signed by his father, when Ceregatti was still a minor) about the duration of his registration to Botafogo -- nine months; 24 months; 48 months circa,"" said Leandro Cantamessa, the lawyer acting for AC Milan. ""AC Milan immediately paid on May 2011 the amount requested by Teixeira pursuant to the first player's declaration and moreover in conformity with Botafogo's records, as collected by Brazilian Federation (CBF) in the so-called sport passport, duly attached to the first Teixeira claim. ""The last declaration has been released by Ceregatti in Brazil, in January 2012, after his escape from Italy and from contractual obligations with AC Milan."" Texeira tells a very different story, insisting he has full the support of Ceregatti, who recently returned to Brazil after signing with Vasco da Gama, and that the Brazilian footballer confirms he had been at Botafogo for four years since the age of 12 from 2004. The gambling game: Soccer's battle with betting . ""The claim is for Botafogo and has nothing to do with Ceregatti,"" added Teixeira, after CNN asked to interview the player. As for Anderlecht, general manager Hermann van Holsbeeck refused to comment on Teixeira's $122,822 compensation claim on behalf of DR Congo club CS Aigles Verts relating to one of their players, but added: ""We have introduced a file against Teixeira by FIFA. We will defend our position at the court."" Teixeira works closely with the Brazilian National Amateur League manager Jose Tobaldini, who keeps track of 140,000 players on a computer database and believes hundreds of young players literally ""disappear"" from their clubs -- lured away by agents and scouts. ""I know they've all gone to Europe, most of them have the possibility of acquiring dual citizenship,"" says Tobaldini. Teixeira claims on Facebook that ""a generation of dozens of young Brazilian and African players were literally taken away from their original clubs by dubious agents and brought to Italy under the so-called primo tesseramento (first contract)."" Often smaller clubs in Brazil and Africa do not have the financial resources to find out what has happened to their players after they have left, presumably for Europe -- which means they are often left without compensation. That is where Teixeira steps in. After a player has turned professional, Teixeira -- with the help of Tobaldini -- tracks down the development club to see if there are compensation issues and then begins the administrative process of demanding what he says is the correct sum to be paid by the European clubs. ""In the beginning I was approaching the clubs, but now more and more I am approached by clubs,"" said Teixeira. ""All due to the internet, as you can imagine. Some African agents have sent me messages saying I've become an icon."" In an arrangement that is reminiscent of the kind of fees ""uplift"" that successful personal injury lawyers use to get paid if and when a dispute is resolved, Teixeria would receive a 20% commission of the amount of the claim. So in the cases he lists on Facebook, the potential compensation amount is close to $2.4 million, which would net Teixeira approximately $480,000 if he is successful. ""Big clubs are always challenging the conformity of training compensation with EU law,"" said Argentine lawyer Ariel Reck, who also has experience with of this area and it is a view supported by British lawyer Guy Thomas. ""The Jean-Marc Bosman case may have increased player power,"" said Thomas, referring to the landmark judgment allowing players to move for free at the end of their contract, ""but ongoing uncertainty over the best way to calculate compensation still allows clubs the chance to push back or delay payment."" Blog: Time to get tough on racism in football . Reck admits these cases are a gravy train for agents and lawyers. ""This is also a business for sports lawyers, I have to confess. Not only South American but also big European firms (mostly Spanish due to language issues) offer clubs the services to claim and collect such compensations. Fees can be as high as 30% of the amount,"" he said. Gravy train or not, this issue may also be an administrative headache for FIFA, which says it receives 3,500 complaints a year -- though not all of these relate to training compensation cases. ""FIFA's normal procedure says that a case should be opened within three to five weeks after the claim is lodged,"" said lawyer Fernando Lamar, who works with Teixeira. ""FIFA says that an ordinary case would take six to 12 months to be solved. However, we have cases in progress for almost two years and we're not halfway through. ""You cannot imagine the time and energy spent trying to reach a FIFA officer to have information about the claims. It is almost a lost battle; the most common responses we get are, 'We are overloaded,' 'We have no time.' "" In a statement to CNN, FIFA said: ""Cases are normally opened within a couple of weeks following the receipt of the relevant complaint. ""As to the duration of a specific procedure, we need to emphasize that many factors influence the advancement of the investigation phase and the decision-making process: the cooperation of the parties, the complexity of the matter, the extent of the documentation provided, the availability of the deciding body -- just to name a few. ""Consequently, we are really not in a position to comment on an estimated timescale ."" In a recent edition of the Sports Law Bulletin, a doctoral researcher at England's University of Westminster came up with an idea to help protect the treatment of minors in football. ""A possible solution to prevent such circumstances could be introduction of a form of authorization for trials via the transfer matching system, albeit trials cannot be deemed as a transfer, "" wrote Serhat Yilmaz, referring to FIFA's governing body electronic method of conducting transfers. So as the lawyers, agents and administrators argue, does Tobaldini have any advice for parents considering letting their offspring move to European clubs? ""First you should build the athlete up, maintain his focus on school and look for an agent -- properly accredited -- with the goal of taking care of his professional career.""","Agent seeks compensation for clubs who lose young players to bigger teams .

"Washington (CNN) -- Although some people believe Elvis Presley is still alive, and he's been on a stamp, the U.S. Postal Service is opening up the opportunity to honor people on a stamp who are unquestionably still around. The agency Monday announced it has dropped a rule that imposed a five-year waiting period after a notable person's death before they could be considered to be featured on a stamp. ""We wanted to make sure the people we suggested had stood the test of time,"" said Stephen Kearney, the Postal Service manager of stamp programs. But in deciding to discontinue the rule, Kearney explained it was limiting the number of worthwhile, relevant candidates, especially those considered meaningful by young people who might be encouraged to buy stamps. Using the agency's Facebook and Twitter accounts, as well as letters sent through the mail, the Postal Service invites the public to submit a ""Top 5"" list of living individuals in a nominating process leading to a new stamp by the middle of next year. Avoiding dubious figures remains part of the selection criteria that measures whether a candidate has done remarkable things for America. A citizen stamp committee will review the nominees that come in over the next month's time, and by mid-November the panel will make a final suggestion to the Postmaster General who will approve or reject. ""Today with today's news cycle, it's hard to hide anything, and the committee will still be careful about those they pick,"" Kearney said. He also ruled out today's politicians. ""What we don't want to do is let stamps get involved in the political process,"" Kearney told CNN, ""so it's very unlikely we would do politicians who are still in the game right now."" Kearney said, ""We're not ruling out sports stars, musicians, writers and artists."" And he added ""another possibility is we might feature people who are not necessarily famous right now,"" but who have demonstrated real or potential achievement. Among notable sports figures, basketball's Michael Jordan, professional golf's Tiger Woods, and baseball's Roger Clemens may come to mind among candidates of achievement who could be considered under the new rules that include the living. Kearney said ""when it gets to a final stage, we do complete research"" into the person who may become the first contemporary honoree, potentially ruling out anyone with questionable background since, in Kearney's words, ""surprises are not good in the world of stamps."" That said, Elvis Presley is an example of someone, dead or alive, who contributed to American culture. In 1992, long after his generally accepted death in 1977, the Postal Service held a public vote as to whether an Elvis stamp should depict him early in his career, or how he was in later years. The portrayal of a ""young"" Elvis won out, on a margin of three-to-one from more than a million votes cast. ""Elvis was the king of stamps,"" said Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders, who said the runoff nearly 20 years ago was conducted using only post cards obtained and mailed at 40,000 post offices nationwide. The Postal Service is in the midst of closing thousands of post offices as part of a financial overhaul to cut red ink. The commemorative stamp program brings in about $200 million a year in profit. ""The main source of profit is those who buy and keep the stamps,"" Kearney explained,""it's serious money, but it's a relatively small drop in the gap we have to close."" Still, if the popularity of Facebook and Twitter can supplement snail mail, postal officials believe the competition to name the first living person featured on a U.S. stamp may top the public's participation in the Elvis runoff.","U.S. postal stamps can now feature living people .

"(CNN) -- Honda have confirmed they are pulling out of Formula One, unless a buyer for the team can be found by the end of the month, blaming the global financial crisis for their decision. Jenson Button, left, and Rubens Barrichello could be out of a job following Honda's withdrawal from F1. Chief executive Takeo Fukui announced at a news conference in Tokyo that the company would be willing to sell the team and will withdraw from the 2009 competition if no buyer is found by the end of Decemebr -- ending the Japanese car giant's nine-year involvement in the sport. ""We, Honda Motor Co Ltd, have come to the conclusion that we will withdraw from all Formula One activities, making 2008 the last season of our participation,"" said Fukui. ""This difficult decision has been made in light of the quickly deteriorating operating environment facing the global auto industry, brought on by the sub-prime problem in the United States, the deepening credit crisis and the sudden contraction of the world economies. ""Honda must protect its core business activities and secure the long term as widespread uncertainties in the economies around the globe continue to mount. A recovery is expected to take some time,"" he added. It is understood the 600 members of staff at Brackley, near the Silverstone circuit in England, were told job losses would be likely, even if a buyer was found for the team. The news also leaves drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello facing an uncertain future, with spare places in rival teams few and far between. Honda's demise would also reduce the F1 grid to just 18 cars (nine teams) and would see them become the second team to fold this year following Super Aguri's closure early in the season. Despite a huge operational budget of $300 million, Honda have under-achieved in the sport, finishing ninth out of 10 in the constructors' standings with Barrichello 14th and Button 18th out of the 20 drivers. Honda Motor Corporation are dealing with faltering sales worldwide and the Formula One team is not the only casualty. On Thursday, 490 temporary employees were told they would be laid off at the end of January, while last month 270 temporary employees were informed their contracts were not being renewed. Max Mosley, president of Formula One's governing body, the FIA,  said Honda's withdrawal had confirmed his ""longstanding concern that the cost of competing in the world championship is unsustainable."" Read more about Mosley's past warnings . Mosley sent a letter to the remaining teams urging them to accept cost-cutting moves including smaller, more fuel-efficient engines, which he estimated would shave up to $60 million off the expense of running a team beginning in the 2010 season. ""In the FIA's view, the global economic downturn has only exacerbated an already critical situation,"" Mosley said. ""What has happened to Honda is very sad because obviously it involves a lot of jobs and they are a key player in Formula One, but I have to say it was not entirely unexpected,"" he added. ""I've been expecting one of the major manufacturers to stop for some time because even before the current situation the costs were completely out of control. Now it's difficult to imagine how any manufacturer could stay in the sport unless we make really substantial reductions in costs."" Meanwhile, Honda team principal Ross Brawn remains confident a suitable new owner could still be found. The former Ferrari technical director told BBC Radio Five Live: ""It's a fantastic opportunity for someone to step into what will be a very competitive team next year. ""The facilities here are one of the best in Formula One, the workforce is definitely one of the best in Formula One and we have got a great car design for next year. ""I think it would be unfortunate for Formula One if this had a domino effect on other teams. I hope that doesn't happen but all the teams are having to face up to this economic environment. ""Formula One unfortunately has a certain inertia and it is difficult to change things quickly because of the regulations. If a car factory gets into difficulty it can close down for a few months, stop production. We can't do that. We have races to go to and schedules to meet. ""It is very difficult to turn the tap off in Formula One overnight but I think the things that are being done now can really make a difference next year and in 2010.""","Honda say they are pulling out of F1 unless a buyer for the team can be found .

"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday called on countries throughout the world to decriminalize homosexuality, a day after the U.S. Supreme Court handed a major victory to proponents of same-sex marriage. Every group of people has a right to its own views, Obama said, and that diversity should be respected, ""but when it comes to how the state treats people -- how the law treats people -- I believe that everybody has to be treated equal."" He spoke at a news conference with President Macky Sall of Senegal, a country in which homosexuality is illegal. ""Regardless of race, regardless of religion, regardless of gender, regardless of sexual orientation ... people should be treated equally, and that's a principle that I think applies universally,"" Obama said. The remarks came in response to a question from CNN as to whether he was pressing Sall on the issue. Obama said that the issue did not come up in their talks, but that the question of how gays and lesbians are treated has been coming up in Africa in general. Sall responded that his country has no plans to decriminalize homosexuality. ""Senegal is a very tolerant country which does not discriminate in terms of inalienable rights of human beings,"" he said, according to an official translation. People are not refused jobs for being gay, he said. ""But we are still not ready to decriminalize homosexuality."" ""But of course this does not mean that we are all homophobic,"" Sall insisted. Sall then turned to another issue on which the two nations differ: capital punishment. ""In our country, we have abolished it for many years,"" he said, adding, ""We do respect the choice of each country."" Obama's Africa visit . Obama left the United States on Wednesday for a trip to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania -- his second visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office. The trip aims to bolster investment opportunities for U.S. businesses, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy. It comes as China aggressively engages the continent. The Asian nation is pouring billions of dollars into Africa, running oil and mining firms, and in 2009 replaced the United States as the largest trading partner. At Thursday's news conference, Obama was asked to assess the big news at home: the Supreme Court ruling Wednesday striking down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The decision was ""not simply a victory for the LGBT community,"" he said, referring to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. ""I think it was a victory for American democracy."" ""I believe at the root of who we are as a people, as Americans, is the basic precept that we are all equal under the law. We believe in basic fairness. And what I think yesterday's ruling signifies is one more step towards ensuring that those basic principles apply to everybody,"" Obama said in response to a question from CNN's Jessica Yellin. His administration will now have to comb through every federal statute, he said, to ensure that federal benefits ""apply to all married couples."" There are complexities, he noted. Since some states recognize same-sex marriages and others don't, the government will need to determine whether a same-sex couple remains married under federal law after moving to a state that does not recognize the marriage. Mandela's influence . Obama also spoke of ailing former South African President Nelson Mandela, who is in critical condition in a Pretoria hospital. ""My first act of political activism was when I was at Occidental College as a 19-year-old -- I got involved in the anti-apartheid movement,"" Obama said. He said he was inspired by what was taking place at the time in South Africa. He had read Mandela's writings and speeches, and understood ""that this was somebody who believed in that basic principle I just talked about -- treating people equally -- and was willing to sacrifice his life for that belief."" Mandela ""is a personal hero"" and ""a hero for the world,"" Obama said. ""And if and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages."" Obama's visit to South Africa on Saturday will include a stop at Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his 27 years in prison. The White House schedule does not include a visit with the anti-apartheid icon. After making his remarks Thursday, Obama visited Goree Island, which once served as a strategic post in the transatlantic slave trade. He called the trip a ""powerful"" reminder that ""we have to remain vigilant when it comes to the defense of human rights. ...This is a testament to when we're not vigilant in defense of human rights, what can happen."" ""Obviously, for an African-American, an African-American president, to be able to visit this site, I think, gives me even greater motivation in terms of human rights around the world,"" Obama said.

"(CNN) -- Samoa Air has taken the next lunge in the debate on air travel and overweight fliers with a new extra-large seat for extra-wide passengers. ""The new seat is like a two-person couch, created from two adjacent seats without an armrest,"" the airline's CEO Chris Langton told CNN. The new seat will also have 14 inches of extra legroom, created by the removal of the row in front. The initiative includes the adoption of a boarding ramp, as opposed to steps. ""Most people around 130 kilos (285 pounds) struggle to get up most steps, so we've redesigned ours into a ramp to help bigger passengers get to their seats,"" said Langton. The tiny airline -- its fleet consists of three planes, each with 10 seats or fewer -- already operates the airline industry's only pay-as-you-weigh pricing scheme, which charges passengers according to their combined body and luggage weight. It transports some of the world's biggest travelers. A 2007 Forbes report claimed 80% of Samoans are overweight, and it's unlikely things have improved since then. ""Some of our customers top out at 210 kilos (460 pounds),"" Langton said. ""Many come in around 160 kilos and around 40% in the 100-130 kilo range."" Pay more get more . Langton said the move -- which will become operational in one of the airline's planes on June 26 -- is meant to offset extra costs incurred under the controversial pay-as-you-weigh plan and acts as a trial for potential implementation in other aircraft. ""Because some bigger passengers will be paying more, we want them to be comfortable,"" said Langton. ""It's a precursor to what will happen to our 100-seater planes, which we'll start operating in three to six months."" Data on passenger weight collected by the airline since November show that for every 50 passengers they fly, three to four will weigh 160 kilos (352 pounds) or more. The pay-as-you-weigh scheme has been criticized for condoning unhealthy eating by travelers. Langton disagrees. ""Airplanes run on weight, whether that's healthy weight or unhealthy,"" he said. ""Our problem is putting that weight on seats and the fact that different people weigh different amounts. It's completely separate from the issue of health."" The airline recently set up a scheme with a local fitness center in which members who lose weight at the gym receive Samoa Air vouchers giving them three kilos for the price of one -- a 66% saving. Weigh in and pay up . The airline's fee structure allows travelers to enter their approximate weight and that of their luggage and prepay based on that ""guesstimate."" A Norwegian economist recently published a paper advocating the practice. Some travelers have criticized the weight-based fare concept as a ""fat tax."" Others believe it's fair. ""Yes, if I am getting less than 100% of the seat I paid for, the person taking my space should have to make up the difference,"" a CNN.com commenter wrote. For a tiny carrier like Samoa Air, the fare model seems reasonable, according to airline analyst Vaughn Cordle, a partner at Ionosphere Capital, a transportation investment research firm. ""For this small operation, specifically with the aircraft they fly, weight restrictions are the key practical problem they have to deal with on every flight. They have a solid business case to charge for weight,"" Cordle said. But travelers are unlikely to see anything like it on a large U.S. airline, he said. ""For U.S. airlines, I think this is an issue they will not touch with a 10-foot pole because of the negative publicity and the practical purposes of weighing people at the gate.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Will the familiar warning for airline passengers to ""discontinue the use of all portable electronic devices"" become a relic of the past? Perhaps. By popular demand, the Federal Aviation Administration is forming a group to study policies governing the use of consumer electronics in the sky. The review could lead to increased use of iPads, portable DVD players and other consumer electronics in aircraft cabins. But don't pull out your cell phone yet. Standby travel: Not for the faint of heart . The new group will not consider the use of cell phones for voice communications while in flight. That's because cell phones are banned by the Federal Communications Commission -- not by the FAA -- over concerns of potential interference to wireless networks on the ground. The FAA, meanwhile, limits devices because of fears that consumer electronics could interfere with airplane communications and navigation systems. A study completed last year cited 75 instances in which consumer electronics were suspected of interfering with plane systems, although it is hard to verify pilots' suspicions because of the difficulty of replicating incidents. All the while, airline travelers are mystified by policies that allow devices on some airlines but not others. And they are bewildered by policies that allow many pilots to use laptops and iPads when passengers cannot. The FAA says the current regulations simply allow passengers to use devices when it has been demonstrated that they can be used safely, and some airlines are more aggressive at testing than others. ""With so many different types of devices available, we recognize that this is an issue of consumer interest,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. Audit: FAA ineffective in program to keep animals from hitting planes . The new government-industry group, to be formally established this fall, will attempt to bring order to the chaos. The group will study current policies and procedures governing portable electronic devices. The FAA said the group will examine a variety of issues, including the testing methods aircraft operators use to determine which new technologies passengers can safely use aboard aircraft and when they can use them. The group will also look at the establishment of technological standards associated with the use of portable electronic devices during any phase of flight. The group will meet for six months and then present its recommendations to the FAA. The FAA is also seeking public input, and a request for comments will appear in the Federal Register on Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen clocked the fastest time on the final day of Formula One Testing at Jerez Friday. The 2007 world champion came home in a time of one minute 18.148sec off 83 laps with Force India's test driver Jules Bianchi in second spot on 1:18.175. Ferrari's Felipe Massa's time of one minute 17.879 seconds, which was set on Thursday, remained the fastest time of the whole week. But Raikkonen, who finished third in the title race last season, is encouraged by the progress made over the past four days. Webber vows to battle Vettel for F1 title . ""We continued our work from Thursday and made some good progress,"" he told reporters ahead of the next test session in Barcelona on February 19. ""We're at the top of the timing monitors, but that means nothing in testing. Our focus has been testing parts on the car, but I've been able to get the set-up more to my liking. ""For sure there's more work to be done in this area, but that's what we're here for. The car feels strong and we seem to have a good idea of where we're going with improvements. Let's see what happens in Barcelona."" Vettel revs up for glory . Meanwhile, triple world champion Sebastian Vettel was satisfied with his day's work, despite being delayed by a pot-hole in the track. ""Everyone is on the limit here, running wide, using the maximum amount of track and the kerbs and unfortunately it started to break up,"" he told reporters. ""But the circuit did a very good job over lunch to get everything sorted and gave us an extra half hour at the end, so no real problem."" Vettel completed 96 laps following the 30 minute wait and the German driver was left impressed with the car's reliability. ""I think for the whole team it's been quite a good test,"" said the German. ""No problems in terms of reliability and we did a lot of laps, so I'm quite pleased with the results. ""I feel a bit better than last year.

"(CNN) -- Major League Baseball is set to suspend some 20 players in the coming weeks due to a scandal involving performance-enhancing drugs, according to an ESPN report that said a key figure in the case is now ready to cooperate with investigators. The network says it is potentially the worst drug-abuse case in the history of U.S. sports. The league declined to comment to CNN but confirmed that an investigation is in the works. The players union said Wednesday that players are being interviewed by baseball officials and are represented by attorneys. ""The commissioner's office has assured us that no decisions regarding discipline have been made or will be made until those interviews are completed,"" the union said in a written statement. Baseball's highest-paid player, New York Yankee third baseman Alex ""A-Rod"" Rodriguez, as well as Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, are among those facing suspension, ESPN said, citing unnamed sources. Both have denied recently using performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs. Rodriguez has admitted in the past to using banned substances when he played with the Texas Rangers in the early 2000s. A-Rod denies performance-enhancing drugs reports . The league may seek to ban the players for 100 games by counting the doping itself as one infraction and lying about having taken the drugs as a second one, ESPN reported. Major league players can appeal any possible suspensions, as Braun did in 2012. That year, a drug test showed high levels of testosterone in his body, but the outfielder successfully disputed the testing process, and the suspension was overturned in February. Asked about the ESPN report Tuesday, Braun said he was sticking by his previous account. ""The truth has not changed,"" he told reporters, declining to comment further. CNN has not independently confirmed the ESPN report. A Florida newspaper first leveled doping allegations at Rodriguez in January. The Miami New Times reported that the shortstop and third baseman had acquired the drugs from a now-closed Miami anti-aging clinic called ""Biogenesis,"" run by Anthony Bosch. Twitter reacts to PED saga . ESPN said Bosch, who allegedly supplied baseball players with performance-enhancing substances, has agreed to cooperate in the MLB investigation. CBS Sports also confirmed Bosch will talk to investigators. Records obtained by MLB name many players, but league investigators need Bosch to attest to their accuracy and confirm that players were doping, ESPN reported, citing unnamed sources. The league filed a suit against Biogenesis in March for allegedly supplying PEDs to players and advising them on how to avoid detection during drug tests. ESPN reported that MLB may drop the suit against Bosch, if he cooperates in its investigation. MLB sues Florida clinic linked to supplying players with PEDs . Managers tight-lipped . On Tuesday, the managers for the Yankees and the Brewers said little. ""I know Major League Baseball is handling it, and that's all I know,"" Brewers manager Ron Roenicke told journalists at a post-game news conference in Milwaukee. Yankees manager Joe Girardi started out dodging reporters who grilled him on ESPN's report after New York's game but softened when it came to his concerns about Rodriguez. ""I always worry about my players, always,"" he said. ""One thing you never want to forget is -- they're human beings."" In January: MLB expands testing for HGH, testosterone . He did not say whether he had discussed the looming scandal with Rodriguez. ""When I talk to Alex, it's baseball-related. That's what it is,"" Girardi said. He feared the game he has dedicated his life to will suffer because of the scandal. ""I worry about baseball being affected as a game, the whole thing, and what it's been through in the last 15 years."" What we've learned: A complete timeline . Rodriguez was at the Yankees training facility in Florida on Tuesday, recovering from an injury. He could not be reached for comment. A 100-game suspension could cost him more that $15 million, ESPN reported. New York outfielder Vernon Wells was discouraged by the scandal. ""We've done so much as a group to try to rid ourselves of conversations like this,"" he said. In spite of advances in drug testing, new doping techniques designed to avoid detection keep coming, Wells said. ""There's always someone out there trying to beat the system from a medical standpoint.""

"(CNN) -- It may not be ""High Noon,"" but the Red Bull team are facing a Shanghai showdown when their two drivers resume rivalries at this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. Sebastian Vettel has been vilified for ignoring team orders and passing his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in Malaysia to whisk the win from under the Australian's nose. Directly behind the dueling Red Bulls, the opposite scenario was playing out as Nico Rosberg reluctantly obeyed team orders not to overtake his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton for third place, even though the German appeared to have a quicker car. The controversial issue of team orders in Formula 1 has once again tested respect between teammates -- and ahead of Sunday's race Vettel said he would probably do it again given he felt Webber had not supported him in the past -- and raised question marks over the purity of the sport's racing. The willingness to accept team orders often relies on a tacit understanding between the drivers, on their status within the team and how the race will be run. Former Honda, Brawn and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello -- who spent six years as Michael Schumacher's deputy at Ferrari -- explained: ""In the team meeting before the race you have to talk about various situations. ""Obviously there is an interest in doing the best for the team,"" Barrichello told CNN. ""All the team wants to see is if one driver has a problem he will not make it difficult for his teammate. ""If it was agreed before by both drivers that they needed to go lower on revs -- and if that is a code for no overtaking -- then that is what they had agreed."" Webber was told to turn down his engine revs after taking the lead in Malaysia. He understood that instruction meant -- as Barrichello suggested -- he would not be passed by his teammate. But the fact that Vettel chose to ignore this instruction and run his own race has left serious, unanswered questions over his respect for Webber. Taking the low road . ""I don't think there's the same respect now for other drivers,"" British racing legend Stirling Moss told CNN. During his F1 career between 1951-60, Moss would only sign contracts that named him as the team's number one driver. In his era of racing, that meant if there was a problem with his speed machine, he could simply call in his teammate and take over his car. There was, however, one exception to Moss' rule when, in 1955, he signed for Mercedes alongside Argentine great Juan Manuel Fangio. The pair shared a mutual respect on and off track, says Moss, even though it was ""El Maestro"" who would capture his third world title at the end of the season. ""When I was at Mercedes with Fangio there were no pit orders at all until we had a 30-second lead over the rest of the field,"" Moss recalled. ""When a team had the lead, the number one driver would hold position and not pass him, says Moss. ""I respected Fangio so much that I was just as happy to be number two. I was quite happy to sit right behind him. It didn't worry me,"" he said. ""We were known as the train because I was only about two yards behind him the whole race!"" It's all different now though, says Moss. ""Because (Red Bull) had specifically said to (Vettel) let Webber have it, that made him a naughty boy but he felt, 'well dammit, why shouldn't I win?' I don't think he'll ever repair that damage because he probably thinks 'well, that's the way I race.'"" Career-defining moments . On the other side of the garage, the Malaysia team orders drama may have more emotional, career-defining consequences for Webber, whose Red Bull contract expires at the end of the season. Barrichello can empathize with Webber's position as he considers his perpetual role as Red Bull's ""number two"" driver. The Brazilian was famously forced to cede first place to Schumacher by Ferrari in the controversial 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. It was the start of a long period of reflection for Barrichello. ""In my case in Austria there were eight laps of conversation because they told me that I should do something that was not agreed,"" he explained. Because of what happened in Austria, people think there was something that was written in his contract. But there wasn't, says Barrichello. ""The year before in Austria I had let Michael by when I was second and he was third and I had that conversation with the team afterwards when I said: 'Listen, what would happen if I was first?' And they said: 'We would never ask you that if you were first,'"" he explains. ""And then it was exactly the case the following year in 2002. I refused to do it until the penultimate corner because it was not agreed. ""It was very hard, it was absolutely very, very hard. I really tried to give my very best to see if the team would ultimately change the philosophy."" It was the reason why the Brazilian quit his Ferrari contract one year early in 2005. ""I saw that there was no winning scenario, the case was lost,"" he said. That career-defining moment for Barrichello also led to a decision by the sport's governing body, the FIA, to ban team orders that directly affected the outcome of a race. Ironically, it was another infamous incident between two Ferrari drivers in 2010 -- when Felipe Massa was told to surrender the lead to teammate Fernando Alonso -- that led to a ban on team orders being stripped from the rulebook in 2011. There was simply no point trying to police something that has always been an intrinsic part of the sport. Teams before drivers . Team orders have always existed in F1 because, in simple terms, teams also want to be happy -- and that often means making money. It is, after all, the teams who finance the drivers' fun and it is their brand and sponsors who they are protecting. When the top teams are spending $1m a day it makes business sense to protect that investment by not allowing drivers to race freely if there is a danger that in the heat of the moment both cars could take each other out of the race. ""The team has always been the most important thing,"" said Moss. ""I drove for teams like Mercedes and Maserati and at one time I drove my own car which meant I could do what the hell I liked!"" he said. ""But once you're with a company you really have to do what they tell you to. It's a professional business with very big money, which it wasn't (when I drove). Drivers are being paid like film stars now."" This constant clamor of commercial team interests means the men at the wheel of the world's fastest cars often have to suppress their racing instincts. That is exactly what Rosberg did in Malaysia and exactly what Vettel chose not to do. Do F1 drivers simply have to accept that when it comes to racing it is the team who ultimately decides how a race is run? ""I don't think drivers accept that,"" says Barrichello. ""There are racetracks when one driver can do better than another and there should be freedom for them to decide that. They should be allowed to fight."" Moss, meanwhile, understands Vettel's racing instincts. ""I suppose he was a naughty boy,"" Moss says, ""but he is a racing driver who's paid to go fast. ""I'm glad I raced when I did and not now because the pleasure was so much more then and the racing certainly was purer."" Few of F1's global television audience of half-a-billion fans would disagree with Moss. Who wants to watch races that have been massaged and manipulated by team orders? But the furore across global media outlets and social media sites following the Malaysian GP also proved F1 fans balked at the unsporting flavor of Vettel's victory --- even if he was doing what a triple world champion is supposed to do, race. There appears to be a thin divide between team orders that protect a worthy longtime leader and instructions that see him denied the taste of champagne from the top step of the podium. Vettel, Webber and Red Bull will begin to find out how much crossing that line in Malaysia has hurt them when they reunite in Shanghai.","Team orders in Formula 1 are a hot topic once again following events in Malaysia .

"New York (CNN) -- The winner of last week's $338 million Powerball jackpot is expected to appear in a New Jersey court Monday on a warrant for unpaid child support. Pedro Quezada, 44, the father of five children ages 5 to 23, owes back child support totaling $29,000, according to William Maer of the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. It is not clear which children would be covered by the payments. A warrant for the unpaid sum was issued in 2009 and was stayed by a judge pending Quezada's expected court appearance. On Thursday, Quezada's son, Casiano, said his father has hired an attorney and is ""working through it."" Attempts to reach the attorney representing Quezada were unsuccessful. Maer said that a child support warrant usually leads to payment, a scheduled payment plan or arrest. Maer could not comment further on the Quezada case because the investigation is ongoing. Every person who wins more than $600 in the lottery is checked for outstanding taxes, liens, child support payments and the like, according to Judith Drucker, public relations manager for the New Jersey Lottery.

"Miami (CNN) -- All Luis had to do was hand a Cuban birth certificate to immigration officials and he was on his way to becoming a U.S. citizen. ""I started to receive my work permission, I went to the DMV, got my driver's license, I get my Social Security and that was it,"" he said. Those are the privileges afforded to Cubans who flee the Castro regime and make it to the United States to seek asylum. But Luis, who asked CNN not to use his real name, was not entitled to the privileges. He's Venezuelan, not Cuban. The forged birth certificate he said he bought for $10,000 was enough to pass initial scrutiny and he was able to live free and clear in the United States for years. Luis is not alone. Pretending to be Cuban has become a trend in visa fraud, according to Alysa Erichs, special agent in charge of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations office in Miami. Anatomy of a fraud . The scam starts with the purchase of a Cuban birth certificate for between $10,000 and $20,000, she said. Birth certificates are not yet computerized in Cuba -- they're torn from a book and the information is filled out by hand before being logged into a register. ""The documents that they are presenting in some cases are actual Cuban birth certificates which are smuggled into the country blank, and then filled in with fictitious information here,"" Erichs said. And while the documents are easily falsified, the benefits they can bring are real. ""There's little doubt that Cubans are treated better than any other group,"" said Cheryl Little, executive director of Americans for Immigrant Justice. ""And that's been the case for decades."" Since the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, Cubans automatically gain refugee status upon arriving in the country and are put on a fast track to naturalization. The minute Cubans set foot on U.S. soil they don't need to worry about being deported, unlike migrants or even asylum-seekers from other countries. They receive a green card after being in the United States for a year and a day -- a much shorter time than faced by other legal immigrants. Paying for a forged birth certificate often also brings coaching on how to answer questions so immigration officials believe the holder is Cuban. Erichs recalls one case in which the document-seller told the buyer, ""OK, we're going to need you to get really sunburned and we're going to drop you off in the water and you're going to have someone that is going to rescue you and you're going to say that you were on a raft or a boat and it sunk."" Arriving in the United States on a raft is the same advice that Fidel Morejon Vega gave one of his buyers, who turned out to be an undercover officer taping the conversation. On camera Morejon can be heard telling the agent, if asked ""why do you have a Mexican accent,"" to say, ""Uh, because I work with a lot of Mexicans, I caught it."" Morejon was arrested. He declined CNN's request for an interview. Court documents show Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Cole accused Morejon of being the leader of a ring that sold fraudulent documents to at least 50 illegal aliens, with proceeds exceeding $500,000. Last year, Morejon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit immigration fraud and he is currently serving a 33-month sentence in a federal prison. Officials say in recent cases they have found more documents that can be traced to Morejon's ring. 'A rising trend' It was an increase in Cuban asylum claims that prompted Homeland Security Investigations Miami, the lead agency for the South Florida Document and Benefit Fraud Task force, to take a closer look at the application process. When they found fraud, a task force initiative, ""Operation Havana Gateway,"" was created. Erichs says the initiative was specifically set up to ""combat a rising trend of immigration fraud based on false claims to Cuban birth and citizenship."" The operation was launched in August 2012 and includes representatives from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the U.S. Department of State. There have been 40 arrests since it was started. Investigators are going back as far as five years, the statute of limitation on these cases, in search of asylum claims made with fraudulent Cuban documents. ""In the past things were probably processed through more along the lines of a rubber-stamp type process,"" Erichs explained. ""Now they are all scrutinized."" That scrutiny may have led to the letter Luis received from immigration authorities asking for more documentation to support his Cuban birth certificate. It came four years after Luis presented himself to immigration officials as a Cuban. In that time he had built a business, gotten married and started his American life. Left with few options, Luis decided to ""self-deport"" instead of being charged with a crime. He went back to Venezuela. Immigration attorney Wilfredo Allen, who's representing people involved in the fraudulent scheme, said: ""Really what this is, is a desperation act by people who don't realize that it is never a good thing to present fraudulent papers."" Luis has now abandoned his forged Cuban papers, but he said resuming life as a Venezuelan at home did not work. He said he was attacked and did not feel safe in his home country. That fear and a longing for his old American life led him to sneak back into the United States over land just last month. He is now living as an undocumented immigrant, under the threat of deportation if caught. That's something Morejon will never understand. When he finishes his prison sentence he will be released back onto the streets of America. Unlike his buyers, Morejon won't be deported. He really is Cuban.","A task force finds that some immigrants are claiming to be Cuban .

"(CNN) -- The new football season is still some weeks away, but already in Italy allegations of racial abuse towards AC Milan's Kevin Constant have marred a friendly. The French-born Guinean player smashed the ball into the stands and walked off the pitch during Tuesday's friendly game against Sassuolo in the northern city of Reggio Emilia after becoming enraged by a section of supporters. The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) confirmed Wednesday that it was examining the incident. ""The Federal Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation to ascertain the extent of the racist incident that took place yesterday evening at the Stadio del Tricolore in Reggio Emilia during the Milan-Sassuolo match (Trofeo TIM), which saw AC Milan player Kevin Constant the subject of chants from some supporters in the stands"" said the FIGC statement. In January, Constant's teammate Kevin Prince-Boateng walked off the field of play after being racially abused by a number of fans during a friendly game against Pro Patria with six people hit with two-month prison sentences. However Milan said that Constant's decision to leave the field was ""not a decision he should have taken upon himself to make."" ""On the evening of July 23rd 2013 there was another episode involving racist intolerance and this time the victim was Kevin Constant, who reacted by leaving the field of play,"" read the Milan statement. ""This was not a decision he should have taken upon himself to make and despite his more than understandable reasons and the anger he must have felt, AC Milan would like to remind everyone that the only people responsible for intervening against any manifestations that offend the human dignity, which includes racial discrimination, are the referee in charge of the match and the head of public safety. ""The use of the legal system and institutional rights, which every member of the public requires to exist in a civil society, does not compensate for the fact that these episodes continue to happen at a frequent rate."" Both Constant and Prince-Boateng declined to be interviewed by CNN, while Sassuolo issued the following statement on its website. ""With reference to the incident that occurred during the Trofeo TIM, Sassuolo Calcio await the results of the investigation and fully condemn any racist expression,"" it read. ""In any case, we also underline the extraordinary fair play of Sassuolo fans in general. Over the years and during the Trofeo TIM last night they supported their team with the utmost sporting values, never transcending into vulgar chants and ensuring visiting fans enjoyed their hospitality."" The incident is the latest in a long line of unsavory episodes of racism which have dogged Italian football in recent times. Only last May, the FIGC itself came under fire from FIFA president Sepp Blatter after the Italian organization fined Roma $65,000 after its fans were found guilty of racially abusing Milan's Mario Balotelli. ""You will always find money,"" Blatter told the world governing body's website at the time. ""What is $65,000 for such an incident? I'm not happy and I will call the Italian Federation. That's not a way to deal with such matters."" In April, Inter Milan were fined nearly $60,000 by European governing body UEFA after its fans were found guilty of ""improper conduct"" in chants directed towards Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor. Two months earlier, Lazio received its fourth charge of racist behavior this season -- with Roma's city rivals having been fined nearly $300,000 after repeated fan transgressions. In May, FIFA adopted tougher penalties for racist behavior during its congress in Mauritius. Punishments for first offenses bring a warning, fine or clubs being forced to play games in empty stadiums. A second offense, or one deemed ""serious,"" could result in demotion, a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament. FIFA also confirmed that any individual found guilty of racist chanting will be suspended for at least five matches. According to UEFA guidelines, which are adhered to by all professional clubs in Europe, there is a three-step procedure for abandoning games if they are marred by racist chanting. First, the referee should halt the contest and ask for announcements to be made over the public address system. The second step would be to suspend the match for a given period of time and, finally, abandon it.","AC Milan defender Kevin Constant suffers alleged racial abuse during friendly contest .

"(CNN) -- Justin Bieber has had a rough week. After celebrating his ""worst birthday"" on March 1 and angering concertgoers at London's O2 Arena on Monday when he was late to the stage, the pop singer had to take a break from his concert on Thursday to receive ""oxygen and treatment backstage,"" his representative said. During the show, the pop star's manager Scooter Braun told the crowd that Bieber was ""backstage with the EMTs and the doctor"" after getting ""very light of breath,"" in a statement posted on YouTube. To the cheers of fans, Braun went on to say, ""He has just told me ... he's going to come out and finish the show."" After the concert, he was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and was released early Friday. ""He's been released from the hospital early this a.m. after a check-up and while he's feeling a little under the weather, he's planning on going ahead with tonight's show,"" the representative said later in the day. Bieber took to his official Twitter account after the incident, thanking fans for sticking with him: ""getting better. thanks for everyone pulling me thru tonight. best fans in the world. figuring out what happened. thanks for the love."" On Instagram, Bieber said he was ""Gettin better listening to Janice Joplin"" in a picture that showed the shirtless singer apparently lounging in a hospital room with a pair of headphones on. Fan response on Twitter was universally supportive. ""Take it easy, try not to work yourself too hard,"" said one fan. ""Hope you're feeling better Justin, love you x,"" said another. This was Bieber's third of four scheduled shows at the arena. On Monday, he kept thousands of young fans and their tired, outraged parents up past their bedtimes after reportedly arriving on stage nearly two hours late for a sold-out show at the same arena. Bieber was greeted by choruses of boos from the crowd. Minutes into his performance, throngs of sobbing school-aged ""Beliebers"" were hauled away by parents desperate to catch the last trains home on a school night. The singer eventually took to Twitter to say that he was only 40 minutes late to the stage, but ""there is no excuse for that and I apologize for anyone we upset."" Not even Bieber's 19th birthday on March 1 would be a high point of the ""Boyfriend"" singer's less than stellar week. ""Worst birthday,"" he tweeted after celebrating at a London nightclub. Reports suggested that he tried to bring underage friends into the club, but he shared his side of the story via Instagram: . ""I love how the club wanted to give the press another reason to why we didn't stay at their weak a-- club so they wouldn't look bad for me walking in and right back out."" Concerned fans have been tweeting the hashtag #JustinTakeBreak with encouraging messages such as, ""Justin, your Beliebers love you no matter what, please take a break your health is important to us"" and ""He's over working himself to make us proud, not being able to breathe while performing is not okay, it's not healthy."" And it seems Bieber is keeping his head up. Earlier this week he wrote, ""It ain't always easy but is what it is. Gonna stay focused. I see and saw all the posts from around the world. U got me smiling. Love u. Thank u."" CNN's Stephanie Goldberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Bieber will perform Friday night as scheduled .

"(CNN) -- Is it just harmless fun, or is something seriously wrong developing in sporting relations between Spain and France? Yannick Noah, the last French tennis player to win the French Open back in 1983, started it last year when he claimed that Spain's recent sporting success could only be due to doping. His remarks were quickly shot down by Rafael Nadal, the Spaniard who has won the Paris grand slam six times -- a record he shares with Bjorn Borg, and may hold alone this year. Now Nadal is at the center of another row, sparked by a comedy program on French channel Canal Plus that spoofed the 25-year-old and cycling champion Alberto Contador, who was this week stripped of his 2010 Tour de France title and banned after a long-running doping saga. The Spanish government is so upset it has told its ambassador to France to send a written protest to French media, including the offending channel. And the Spanish Tennis Federation has responded by threatening a lawsuit. ""The RFET will sue Canal Plus Francia for broadcasting a video which, besides inadmissible and slanderous insinuations, uses the federation's logo. The RFET will also get support from other Spanish sports federation mentioned in that video, so that there is a common judicial action,"" it said in a statement. The French show, called ""Les Guignols"" (the Puppets), features lifelike representations of Nadal, Contador and Spain's World Cup-winning football captain Iker Casillas among others. They are shown writing in books with syringes, and in one scene the muscular Nadal puppet fills up its car's petrol tank from its own bladder. ""On this occasion, intolerable limits were crossed and the RFET cannot tolerate the lack of respect and slander toward our athletes,"" Spanish Tennis Federation president Jose Luis Escanuela said. Nadal, who has never failed a drug test, also expressed his displeasure in interviews with Spanish media, calling it ""a globalized campaign from the neighboring country."" ""At the end of the day it is humor,"" Nadal said in quotes reported by national newspaper El Pais. ""One day is okay but when, from what I understand, it is done repeatedly then that is not so good because it crosses the line a bit. And it is always with the same focus. ""The institutions in general have to defend us because I don't think it is a campaign against me or a campaign against anyone. It is a campaign against Spain in general, and against Spanish sports. ""I don't think it is only Canal Plus that does it. I think there are other media pushing it along and I think that is something punishable because in Spain sportspeople who are not clean are punished, they don't compete."" Noah's comments were made in the wake of Spain's incredible sporting achievements in recent years. Nadal was world No. 1 until last year, when he won his 10th grand slam title, having ended Roger Federer's dominance before he too was usurped by Novak Djokovic. Contador has won the Tour de France three times, though he lost one of those titles after testing positive for a small amount of the banned steroid clenbuterol. He overturned his initial ban, but the International Cycling Union and the World Anti-Doping Agency successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Casillas has led Spain's all-conquering football team to the 2008 European title and the 2010 World Cup crown, while his club Real Madrid's big rivals Barcelona have been similarly dominant.","Rafael Nadal angry with French TV program's depiction of Spanish athletes as drug users .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Janet Jackson and four of her siblings sent a scathing letter to the men who control Michael Jackson's estate, accusing them of fraud and of abusing their mother. ""THIS HAS TO STOP NOW: NO MORE!!"" the Jackson siblings wrote in the letter obtained by CNN. The letter also suggested that their mother, Katherine Jackson, suffered a ""mini-stroke"" recently, which her lawyer quickly disputed. Family, fans mark Michael Jackson's death three years later . The controversy even led Paris Jackson, the late pop star's 14-year-old daughter, to use her Twitter account to weigh in. ""i am going to clarify right now that what has been said about my grandmother is a rumor and nothing has happened, she is completely fine,"" Paris tweeted. Relations between the Jackson family and executors John Branca and John McClain have been strained for most of the three years since Michael Jackson's sudden death from an overdose of an anesthetic used as a sleep aid. The letter mostly repeats allegations made by family members, but it also threatens new legal action against Branca, an entertainment lawyer, and McClain, a music executive, who worked with Jackson at several points in his career. ""We know there is most certainly a conspiracy surrounding our brother's death and now coarse manipulation and fear are being used to cover it up,"" they wrote. ""Your heartless pursuit of wealth, fame and power is at the expense of our family, whose deepest desire is to give to the world a gift of hope, love and unity through our music."" Stallone decries 'speculation' over son's death . It was signed by Janet, Jermaine, Tito, Randy and Rebbie Jackson. Jackie, Marlon and La Toya Jackson did not sign it, nor did parents Joe and Katherine Jackson. ""We are saddened that false and defamatory accusations grounded in stale Internet conspiracy theories are now being made by certain members of Michael's family whom he chose to leave out of his will,"" estate spokesman Jim Bates said in a statement to CNN. ""We are especially disheartened that they come at a time when remarkable progress has been made to secure the financial future of his children by turning around the estate's finances as well as during a time when so many of Michael's fans, old and new, are enjoying his artistry through exciting new projects."" The will, which was validated in probate court in the months after Jackson's June 25, 2009, death, put all Jackson's assets into a trust that benefited his mother, Katherine; his children, Prince, Paris and Blanket; and charities. Branca and McClain were named as executors. The signature page indicated that Michael Jackson signed the will in Los Angeles on July 7, 2002, on which date the Jacksons say he was in New York. The siblings' letter charged that ""without question, it's fake, flawed and fraudulent."" Rihanna sues her former accountants . ""According to what is witnessed in the document, it is impossible and illogical that he could have been in two places at one time,"" the letter said. ""We have evidence that undoubtedly supports and proves that Michael was absolutely not in Los Angeles, California, on the date his signature reflected in the will at hand."" They also questioned why their brother would name as executors someone he disliked. ""Our brother told us, in no uncertain terms and without hesitation in the months prior to his death, that he despised both of you and that he did not want either of you to have anything to do with his life or estate for that matter,"" the letter said. ""We know that and you know that."" Courts have already settled the matter, the estate spokesman said. ""Any doubts about the validity of Michael's will and his selection of executors were thoroughly and completely debunked two years ago when a challenge was rejected by the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the California Court of Appeals and, finally, the California Supreme Court,"" Bates said. The Jackson brothers and sisters also accuse Branca and McClain of abusing their 82-year-old mother through lies and manipulations. ""Your actions are affecting her health, and on top of that, we've just found out she recently had a mini-stroke. Please understand, she's not equipped to handle the stress load you are putting on her,"" her children said. ""She feels, as she has said, 'I'm stuck in the middle.' She too knows and acknowledges the will was forged. She wants to do the right thing, and move in the direction of justice for her son and family, yet she fears the POWERS THAT BE."" Katherine Jackson's lawyer Perry Sanders disputed that she was in poor health. Glen Campbell cancels tour dates . ""Mrs. Jackson is extremely lucid and does a great job caring for Michael's children,"" Sanders said Wednesday. The siblings also attacked Sanders, Katherine Jackson's manager, Lowell Henry, and adviser Trent Jackson for discouraging her from joining their challenge of the will's validity. ""Instead, her so-called advisers are convincing her to let them negotiate 'deals' with Branca and McClain on her behalf, or is it on the behalf of all of you,"" they wrote. ""Her advisers' loyalty seems to be skewed by the percentage you offer them, preventing them from advising her properly."" Sanders responded that he's always been available ""to speak with or meet with any of Mrs. Jackson's children to answer any questions they might have. It is unfortunate that they haven't taken me up on the offer."" ""Anyone who actually knows me knows my only loyalty in this matter is to Mrs. Jackson, and the public record of my success for her speaks for itself,"" Sanders said. He pointed to success in paying off her $14 million civil court judgment to a South Korean company, persuading the estate not to sell the family's Hayvenhurst mansion and ""helping get her family allowance increased almost tenfold, to name a few."" Deep Purple keyboardist Jon Lord dies . The siblings' letter told the executors they have ""dishonored everything our brother stood for."" ""Your greed and hasty business decisions have shown that you have no regard for the preservation of his legacy, nor the quality of work that he exemplified,"" they said. ""You have disrespected our parents and family too many times. We do not respect you as executors, and we don't respect the projects and choices you've made, nor do we appreciate the public perception that the Jackson family is behind all of this, exploiting Michael our brother for financial gain, when it's the two of you and your affiliates who do so."" Finally, the five Jacksons wrote that they would ""take every appropriate action to seek justice and to see to it that the truth be known."" ""Be informed, we are considering retaining a law firm, Baker Hostetler, who have advised us on the potential criminal misconduct in your actions. We will hand this over to proper authorities,"" they wrote. Bates said the executors ""have diligently carried out their fiduciary duties as well as their obligation to Michael to make sure that his estate benefits the only family members he named in his will, his mother and his three children.""

"(CNN) -- Facebook may be working on an app that will let your friends, or even complete strangers, know where you are at all times. If that sounds unpleasant, even creepy, you're not alone. But it sounds an awful lot like a small but growing mobile sector in which users knowingly sacrifice some privacy in exchange for ""social discovery."" And, as Facebook works to make money off its constantly growing list of mobile users, such a feature raises questions about how the company will use the personal info it would collect. On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Facebook is developing a smartphone app that would track the location of users. The app would run in the background of smartphones even when not opened and is designed to help users find nearby friends, according to one of two unnamed sources cited in the article. A Facebook spokeswoman told CNN that the company has no comment about the report. Social discovery, or stalking? Some observers have expected such a move by Facebook since last year when the social networking giant bought Glancee, a mobile app designed to help users find nearby friends. That's similar to a handful of other mobile apps, such as Highlight, Banjo and Sonar. These services seem pitched mostly to a young, outgoing user base seeking existing or new pals for drinks, dancing, sipping coffee or sexual hookups. But, when applied to Facebook's purported 1 billion-strong membership, which includes everyone from teens to grandparents, it gives some privacy advocates pause. ""We've already seen some of the mishaps that can occur when location is used in unexpected ways,"" said Jules Polonetsky, director of the Future of Privacy Forum, a Washington-based think tank. ""I think the challenge is that aggregating by location clearly might provide some really useful information. But there are a whole lot of social norms that can be stressed, by even public information."" Polonetsky cited Girls Around Me, an app that rounded up check-ins by women on Foursquare and Facebook to let users, presumably guys on the prowl, know which bars, clubs or other spots currently had lots of women in them. Girls Around Me raised concerns about stalking and eventually got booted from Apple's App Store. ""It didn't clearly violate any of the specific rules that the App Store lays out, other than extreme creepiness,"" Polonetsky said. ""But creepy is sometimes in the eye of the beholder. One person's creepy is another tech enthusiast's tool."" The key, he said, would be whether Facebook clearly sets out guidelines for how such an app would be used. He said members should be allowed to opt in to the service, not automatically be enrolled in it unless they opt out. ""You don't want people ever sharing information without knowing, and I don't think Facebook is going to be in a position to do that,"" he said. The future of social sharing . Heralded briefly as the next wave of social sharing, a handful of these location-based ""social discovery"" apps launched last year amid some degree of hoopla. But a year later, none have gained much traction among mainstream audiences in the way Twitter, Foursquare and some other apps did before them. Paul Davison, CEO of discovery app Highlight, acknowledges it's been a slow burn for a service such as his. A year after launching, Highlight still won't release how many active users it has (though he said membership has tripled in six months). Privacy concerns, he said, are part of the challenge. ""That's not surprising,"" Davison said. ""I think that any time a technology comes out that allows us to share in a way we haven't been able to share before, you see this really familiar pattern. ""Most of us look at it and think, 'That's weird. That's creepy and I don't like it.' What you normally see is a subset of people saying 'That is kind of crazy, but I'll try it out.' And they see it's pretty rewarding and fun."" Davison considers apps such as his no less than the future of social sharing. ""If you look at what's happened on the Web over the last 5 to 10 years with Facebook and other services, we love to share,"" he said. ""We love to talk about ourselves ... and we're obsessed with learning about other people."" But for some, he said, the real world can be like ""some bizarre social network where every profile is a single photo."" On Highlight and similar apps, profiles are meant to let users know if someone around them shares their interests and might be a fun person to meet. ""It's a big change in how the world works,"" he said. ""It's hard for me to think of a bigger shift in how the world works, but it's not going to happen overnight."" How Facebook might use app . Facebook-owned Glancee was somewhat more limited, pinging users when people already in their other social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn, are around. But for the folks from Mark Zuckerberg's company, such an app could have another payoff. Literally. It would provide Facebook with reams of new data about not just where its users frequently go, but where they are right now. Facebook said it doesn't sell its data to advertisers. But it definitely leverages the data to help those advertisers target potential customers. It's not hard to envision ads showing up letting users know that there's a 2-for-1 drink special right around the corner, or that the restaurant next door has the best burger in town. ""They need to make money on mobile, and that's what they've been pushing for since the IPO,"" said Justin Lafferty, co-editor of AllFacebook, an unofficial Facebook blog. ""They're trying to build the technology first, then maybe find out how to build ads into it, too."" Lafferty, who wrote about this week's Bloomberg report, said Facebook could launch a social discovery app separate from its main mobile app -- at least at first. ""That's sort of how Facebook usually works,"" he said. ""They'll test features, then they'll implement them all in the native app."" How will users react to such an app, were Facebook to launch one? Privacy advocate Polonetsky said that remains to be seen. ""The reality is that, for most people, even if things are broadcast to all their friends and the public, they still have some expectation about the way that it's used,"" he said. ""I totally get that my neighbor knows when I come and go and may even say, 'We haven't seen you in a while -- is everything OK?' ""But if someone else seemed to know about my comings and goings and offered me a product or service based on it? I don't know.""","Facebook is working on app that tracks users' locations, a report says .

"(CNN) -- The tragedy of the train derailment in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, has brought home just how small our world has become. Oil that was drilled in North Dakota's Bakken oil fields is loaded onto rail cars and passes through a small Canadian community and shatters their world in an instant. All my thoughts and best wishes go out to the families and emergency responders in the midst of this human and environmental catastrophe. Everyone is touched by this man-made disaster -- 20 killed, 30 missing -- because so many communities have a rail line running right through the middle of town. Here in North Dakota, like all over the U.S. and Canada, towns grew up around the railroad lines. They brought people in to help settle the state and shipped the farm and manufacturing products to other parts of the world. But the increase in the amount of volatile crude oil being transported by rail from North Dakota's Bakken fields has brought a new and troubling set of problems to the debate about our continued dependency on fossil fuels, and particularly oil, as an energy source. Railroad engineers did not have transporting oil in mind when they laid out the routes. They did not avoid population centers, rivers, or environmentally sensitive areas. They were only concerned with getting from Point A to Point B in the most efficient manner possible. In fact, trains carrying oil tanker cars run just two blocks from my office, right through the heart of Bismarck, North Dakota. Rail is the most efficient way to move freight, and Sierra Club is a big fan of rail for transporting people and conventional freight. But moving extreme fossil fuels, like Bakken shale or Alberta tar sands, is a different story entirely. These fuels are ""extreme"" because they are more toxic and more carbon intensive than conventional oil. They are also more dangerous to transport than conventional sources of oil. Production in the Bakken fields has increased nearly 10 times since 2011. To move all this crude, oil rail companies are running longer, heavier trains. And they are running them farther than ever before, bringing crude to refineries on the East, West and Gulf coasts. The regulatory framework for train safety wasn't designed for crude oil trains, and the rail and safety infrastructure is out of date and not up to the task. A state transportation safety spokesman in Maine this week said that the Lac-Magantic disaster is ""on the same parallel as a tractor-trailer accident. It's private commerce and we don't get involved."" This catastrophe proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that the transportation of Bakken shale requires much more vigilant oversight. It's too early to draw conclusions from the ongoing catastrophe in Lac-Megantic, but there's one simple lesson that we should not ignore. Bakken shale, tar sands, and other extreme fossil fuels threaten our towns and our communities. We can't afford the additional cost, in safety or pollution that these fuels bring. And with growing efficiency and with renewable sources of energy, we don't need them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wayde Schafer.","Wayde Schafer: Many communities have rail lines running right through them .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The case: routine. One man's summary of the facts: anything but. Chief Justice John Roberts shows his writing chops in a dissenting Supreme Court opinion. The man in this case is the top man at the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts, who on Tuesday turned a brief dissent in a criminal appeal into something straight out of a Dashiell Hammett detective novel. He offered his thoughts in a case about whether a police officer's arrest of a drug suspect was proper. Let Roberts tell the story in his own words: . ""North Philly, May 4, 2001. Officer Sean Devlin, Narcotics Strike Force, was working the morning shift. Undercover surveillance. The neighborhood? Tough as a three-dollar steak. Devlin knew. Five years on the beat, nine months with the Strike Force. He'd made fifteen, twenty drug busts in the neighborhood. ""Devlin spotted him: a lone man in the corner. Another approached. Quick exchange of words. Cash handed over; small objects handed back. Each man then quickly on his own way. Devlin knew the guy wasn't buying bus tokens. He radioed a description and Officer Stein picked up the buyer. Sure enough: three bags of crack [cocaine] in the guy's pocket. Head downtown and book him. Just another day at the office."" The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ultimately tossed out the suspect's conviction on possession of a controlled substance. Seven of Roberts colleagues rejected an opportunity to fully hear the state's appeal, prompting his turn at creative opinion-writing. Justice Anthony Kennedy agreed with Roberts' conclusions, if not his flair for Sam Spade-style rhetoric. Roberts later got serious in his dissent, writing, ""I think the police clearly had probable cause to arrest the defendant."" This is not the first time the 53-year-old chief justice has spiced up his writings with cultural references. In a July dissent in an especially dry case over who can file certain lawsuits, he quoted singer Bob Dylan. Or misquoted him. Amid arcane talk of legal standing and redressability, the youngest member of the high court showed his generational bearings by citing part of the lyrics from Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone."" ""The absence of any right to the substantive recovery means that respondents cannot benefit from the judgment they seek and thus lack Article III standing. 'When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.' "" Roberts then acknowledged the line came from the singer's 1965 album ""Highway 61 Revisited,"" and even helpfully added the record label in parentheses (Columbia Records). Court historians will note it is very likely the first time a rock lyric was cited in a high court opinion. But in a profession that values accuracy, Roberts got it wrong. The actual lyric on ""Highway 61 Revisited"" goes, ""When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose"" -- note the word ""ain't."" The elusive ""ain't"" has been debated by Dylan scholars. Dylan's own Web site, bobdylan.com, does not include ""ain't"" in the lyrics. Other references are divided on the issue, and there are certainly recorded versions of the song that don't include it.  But at least on ""Highway 61 Revisited,"" Dylan does indeed say ""ain't."" Perhaps the law clerks provided Roberts with an incorrect citation. Or maybe the chief justice just remembered the line differently from his younger, less stuffy days. The chief justice never explained the reasons behind his literary leanings. He doesn't have to.","John Roberts' opinions show literary flair, include pop culture references .

"(CNN) -- Airline passengers may be asking themselves: Are those longer lines at airports due to federal spending cuts? The answer is yes and no. If you are at a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint, relax. You're just experiencing a normal wait. Agency cuts have not yet taken effect, but stick around. TSA says you'll be experiencing longer wait times in coming weeks and months -- the result of furloughs, overtime cuts and a hiring freeze. But if you're on the customs line at New York's John F. Kennedy airport, Miami International or a few others, you, indeed, are feeling the first impacts of the spending cuts on the aviation system. JFK airport had approximately 56 flights with wait times in the arrival area of customs exceeding two hours and 14 flights experiencing related waits of more than three hours, according to Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Patrol. Miami had 51 flights reporting waits at customs exceeding two hours and four flights approaching or topping three hours. ""These wait times are not typical for this time period and are related to decreased booth staffing,"" Burke wrote to CNN. Cuts in overtime forced the customs agency to close several booths and the situation will worsen after furlough notices go out on March 7, she said. More than $85 billion in automatic, government-wide spending cuts took effect on Friday night. The Obama administration said the so-called sequester would hit air travel, particularly hard, through cuts in spending on air traffic control and security. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on Monday the airport lines this weekend were just the tip of the iceberg. ""We will see these effects cascade over the next week,"" she said. ""I don't mean to scare, I mean to inform. If you're traveling, get to the airport earlier than you otherwise would. There's only so much we can do with personnel,"" Napolitano said. ""And please, don't yell at the customs officers or the TSA officers. They're not responsible for sequester."" Napolitano said she expects wait times to double in some cases, if the cuts continue for the next several months. ""There's very little we can do to mitigate it because the procedures we use to clear passengers and cargo, they're responsible I think for the fact that we have a very safe aviation system and we have a very good land migration system where we know who's coming into the country,"" she said. ""So, we're not going to cut back on those security needs so the end result is fewer people doing the same thing means lines are going to get longer."" The TSA said a hiring freeze will take effect in April. That will result in an additional 1,000 screener vacancies by Memorial Day weekend and up to 2,600 vacancies by September 30, the end of the fiscal year. The TSA has approximately 50,000 screeners. ""With TSA staffing levels decreasing over time, we expect that during busy travel periods wait times exceeding 30-40 minutes could double at nearly all of the largest airports,"" the TSA said in a statement. ""In addition, passengers who schedule their travel outside of peak flight schedules and plan to arrive close to their scheduled flight time may see their wait times reach 30 minutes or more,"" the TSA said. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday that there were ""no immediate impacts"" from spending cuts. But it has predicted flight delays when it begins furloughs -- one third of whom are air traffic controllers.","Some extended wait times at customs can be traced to government spending cuts .

Cuts also expected to impact FAA air traffic services, possibly airline schedules .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes a sign of the times is subtle. Let's talk about it: Second Life has long been a forum for self-help, now some rehab centers are setting up shop there. For clients of an alcohol rehab center in Atlanta, one appears in the form of an after-care option: they can meet their therapist for follow-up sessions in Second Life, the popular virtual world. The clients at Accelerated Recovery Centers, all addicted to alcohol, first complete an initial two to three weeks of intensive therapy at the center, undergoing training and meeting with psychologists, counselors, life coaches, medical professionals, nutritionists and personal trainers. Then they go home -- where temptation waits. To cope with that, over the next nine to 12 months they have sessions with their therapist over the phone, through a video-chat service like Oovoo.com, or in Second Life. In the latter, an avatar that the client controls meets with another that the therapist controls. The rehab center has been carefully replicated within Second Life, on a secure parcel of virtual real estate called Identity Island. The furniture, walls, and layout of the virtual rehab center look the same as in Atlanta. The therapist's face is mimicked on the avatars. Audio is used rather than text chat, so the therapist's voice comes from the avatar during sessions. There's also group therapy, with many avatars meeting at once. But the rehab center is not about technology -- it's about helping clients overcome alcohol addiction. (The center was started about three years ago; the Second Life option came last year.) Some clients decide against Second Life. They're not comfortable with computers, perhaps, or they don't like being represented by an avatar. But for many, the virtual world works. They have a sense of having ""been somewhere,"" notes David E. Stone, a licensed psychologist at the center and its chief technology officer. And they feel ""more comfortable meeting in a replica of the therapy room that they used in real life."" Many also tend to reveal more, or be more direct, in the virtual world -- a phenomenon called ""online disinhibition."" (You can see it in chat rooms too.) And different aspects of identity tend to emerge with different mediums, whether text, voice, video or avatar (or in-person), just as a group setting reveals different things than one-on-one. Avatar-based therapy raises some intriguing questions. For instance: Do clients identify with their avatars? ""Clients may possibly objectify or distance themselves from their avatar, which in some cases might attenuate the effects of the therapy,"" notes John Suler, a psychology professor at Rider University in New Jersey who has studied the topic. But in some cases an avatar might help, he notes. For instance developing an ""observing ego"" -- the ability to look at oneself objectively and rationally -- is critical to many kinds of psychotherapy. ""It's possible that interacting through an avatar might stimulate that observing ego,"" he says. The rehab center's use of the virtual world is, if anything, restrained. Of course not every problem can be addressed in Second Life, such as, Stone feels, psychotic disorders. Immersive worlds help cope with the real world . But many therapists believe virtual worlds can help clients deal with fears or addictions and experiment with new behaviors and means of expression. Avatars are not always involved. For instance a virtual world can be immersive, with earphones, wrap-around goggles, vibrating floors or chairs, and even smells, so users feel they're ""in"" the world rather than controlling an avatar moving through it. The former has more power to distract, to the point where in some experiments burn victims have felt reduced pain while immersed. Such setups, however, can get expensive, whereas Second Life is free or low cost, making it an easy way for therapists to experiment with virtual worlds. The U.S. military uses virtual reality to help Iraq War veterans cope with post-traumatic stress disorder. Added to the visual experience are smells and sounds -- like burning rubber and Arabic prayer -- to help trigger flashbacks so they can be dealt with gradually in a safe environment, with a therapist on hand. A California chain called the Virtual Reality Medical Center helps clients overcome a wide range of fears, including of flying, heights, public speaking, closed spaces and spiders. Virtually Better in Georgia has similar offerings. The list goes on, with variations seen around the developed world. But these are still early years, and much remains to be seen and tested when it comes to virtual worlds and psychotherapy. Stone and his team plan to share their findings on the use of Second Life at an American Academy of Psychotherapists event in November. A fair bit of self-help goes on in Second Life, without therapists. For instance some physically disabled users combat depression by flying, dancing and earning a living in the virtual world. Shy types gain real-world confidence in virtual parties. This sort of thing is likely to happen more often. Research firm Gartner estimates that 80 percent of Net users worldwide will be in non-gaming virtual worlds like Second Life by the end of 2011. Ironically, Internet addiction is also likely to rise -- meaning in some cases one malady could be swapped with another. Not all therapists will go virtual. Many insist on seeing cues like appearance, facial expressions and body language. Some set up shop in Second Life but require a real-world meeting first. Others accept PayPal and offer their services to any avatar or website visitor who happens along. Of course long-term success is rarely a sure thing in psychotherapy, whatever the approach. Back at the rehab center, therapists and clients are easing into virtual reality. Avatar-based therapy is just an option. In any case clients must return to the center at least once. The real center, that is, in Atlanta -- to meet with the real version of their therapist.","Some rehab centers using virtual worlds to complement therapy for addiction .

"North Attleborough, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Authorities searched the home of New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez on Saturday for the second time since a man was found dead a half mile away. Hernandez has not been named a suspect in the case, and it's unclear what investigators were looking for. At least 20 state and local police investigators descended on the home around 1:30 p.m. They ended their search by early Saturday evening, and removed about a dozen brown paper evidence bags from the home. Some investigators wore blue latex gloves as they entered. At least two police dogs went into the house and also searched the backyard. Investigators also searched a white SUV parked in Hernandez's driveway. It was the second time police searched the football player's home in connection with an investigation into the death Monday of Odin Lloyd. Lloyd's family says he was a friend of Hernandez and had partied with him. The Boston Globe reported that surveillance images recorded early Monday morning -- hours before Odin's death -- appeared to show Hernandez and Lloyd together on a Boston street. CNN has not independently confirmed the newspaper's report, which cited two law enforcement officials. Hernandez was last seen Friday afternoon when he arrived home, accompanied by his attorney. The athlete has yet to say anything publicly about the homicide case. Neither the district attorney nor Hernandez's lawyer have returned calls for comment. Player, authorities mum as probe continues into man's death . A statement from his lawyer acknowledged that there was an investigation, but didn't confirm media reports that authorities had questioned his client. ""It has been widely reported in the media that the state police have searched the home of our client, Aaron Hernandez, as part of an ongoing investigation,"" attorney Michael Fee said earlier this week. ""Out of respect for that process, neither we nor Aaron will have any comment about the substance of that investigation until it has come to a conclusion."" The 27-year-old Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was found dead less than a mile from Hernandez's expansive home in North Attleborough. Police have searched the home and sifted through the nearby woods for clues. A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said Lloyd was shot to death. As part of the investigation, authorities have also searched a strip club in Providence, Rhode Island, and copied video from a surveillance camera there, Providence Police Capt. Mike Correia said. A search warrant was executed Thursday at Club Desire, where authorities copied surveillance video from more than one day, he said. Police haven't revealed what they were looking for at the club. Authorities say the owner cooperated and consented to the search. CNN was unable to reach the club's owner or other club officers after leaving several messages. CNN's Yon Pomrenze, Lawrence Crook and Bob Crowley contributed to this report from North Attleborough, Massachusetts.","Investigators complete second search of NFL player's home .

"(CNN) -- A person who dies a violent and newsmaking death is often destined to be defined by a brief label. So it was that story after story about the murder in Beverly Hills, California, of 64-year-old Ronni Chasen has characterized her, in the phrase that inevitably precedes her name, as ""Hollywood publicist."" ""A suspect in the murder of Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen shot himself in the head as he was about to be arrested by police,"" one report began. Another: . ""Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen was murdered as she was driving through Beverly Hills, California, in a random 'robbery gone bad,' by a man who killed himself last week, according to preliminary findings in the Beverly Hills police investigation."" Accurate enough, as far as it goes. She was, indeed, a longtime publicist in the entertainment industry. When a person is murdered, the label affixed to his or her name in the news reports becomes, forever, who he or she is, as if nothing came before. I had a friend from childhood who, 15 years ago, at the age of 47, was murdered one awful night, also in Southern California. I remember how jarring it was to read the lead paragraph in the story in the Los Angeles Times: . ""The body of a mortgage broker who had been shot to death after returning from a Clippers game was discovered Thursday morning, authorities said."" The body of a mortgage broker? That's who Leon was? Not to those of us who remembered him as a laughing, lively eyed boy, full of energy and good humor, in love with sports, in love with music, always ready for a pizza at Rubino's on Main Street in the Ohio town where we grew up. The body of a mortgage broker? Crime stories, by their nature, must compress a lot of information on a tight deadline. They inherently can't tell us much about who the victims were before they became classified as victims. But one paragraph in a follow-up story about Ronni Chasen's murder caught my eye: . ""Ms. Chasen grew up in the Washington Heights and Riverdale sections of New York, the daughter of a real estate broker and a homemaker. As a child, Ms. Chasen was athletic and gregarious, entering and winning yo-yo contests organized by the Duncan Toys Company, according to her brother, Larry Cohen."" She was in those Duncan contests? In the decades after World War II, Duncan would send yo-yo whizzes around the country, to big towns and small, to hold demonstrations at five-and-ten-cent stores and local athletic fields, teaching boys and girls how to do the most intricate tricks (and selling those boys and girls lots of yo-yos in the process). In our town, the yo-yo star who annually passed through called himself ""Dan-Dan the Yo-Yo Man."" I suppose I assumed that all of Duncan's traveling stars called themselves that, sort of like all the Ronald McDonalds. Roger Ebert, my friend of 40 years, has written about his memories of Dan-Dan the Yo-Yo Man pulling into his hometown of Urbana, Illinois, in a dark maroon 1950 Hudson automobile: . ""Dan-Dan dismounted on the far side of the big Hudson, and when he walked into view there were already two yo-yos spinning in the air before him, making a whirl of red and yellow. He walked smiling toward home plate, let the yo-yos bounce off it, and snapped them on the fly into his pockets. He took out one, and rocked the baby, walked the dog, skinned the cat, made the monkey climb the string and went around the world. Then he pulled out a Camel, lit up, and passed out flyers for the city-wide Duncan yo-yo contest that would be held on the stage of the Princess Theater on Main Street in Urbana for the following three Saturdays."" There are probably many ways that a person such as Ronni Chasen can first feel the spark that leads to a career as a Hollywood publicist, but being a part of those Duncan yo-yo contests would qualify as an early intriguing view into the power of creative, fun and relentless promotion of a leisure-time product. I don't think I've ever seen publicity and marketing quite as effective as what the yo-yo man did on his yearly trips across the country. Those Duncan Tournament yo-yos, and Duncan Imperials, and Duncan Butterflies, sold for as little as 39 cents apiece. Was it worth it to send the dazzling yo-yo promoters through the United States to sell a 39-cent product? ""If you sell enough of them, it's worth it,"" said Mike Burke, Duncan's national sales and marketing manager, when I asked him the question. Burke put me in touch with one of the original traveling yo-yo men, Bob Rule, now 74, who lives in Duluth, Georgia. (Rule told me that his name on the road was ""Mr. Yo-Yo,"" and that I was wrong about all of them being called Dan-Dan: ""If you saw Dan-Dan the Yo-Yo Man, then you saw Danny Maris."") He said that running the yo-yo shows ""taught you how to walk into places you don't belong, and pretend that you belong. It taught you how to take a product and promote it. To figure out how to get a local television station to put you on the air, to get a newspaper feature writer to interview you. It gave you the confidence to go out and promote."" Ronni Chasen, before she was a Hollywood publicist, witnessed firsthand the yo-yo man working his marketing magic in her hometown. Who ever knows where life will lead? We are, in large part, who we were. In a news story 15 years ago about the murder of my childhood friend -- ""The body of a mortgage broker ..."" -- there was a brief mention of what he had done earlier on the night he died. In his car on the way to the Los Angeles Clippers basketball game, a California friend to whom he had given a ride said, he was playing a collection of rock 'n' roll oldies he had just purchased. ""He was listening with fond memories,"" the friend told the reporter. Going to watch a sports event, listening to the music he had long loved -- he was the same person he had always been, before, and in a way he never would have wanted, he wound up in headlines. The crime stories tell us about the end. If you read between the lines, sometimes you think you can see traces of the beginning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Recent murder victim will always be ""Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen""

"(CNN) -- Sylvin Barnett makes a living driving a forklift for a beer company, but his real passion is on the road. The 41-year-old is a leading exponent of a little-known offshoot of tennis that has made him a celebrity in his native Barbados, and he hopes that its appeal will go global. Road Tennis is a fast and furious scaled-down version of the sport which can be played almost anywhere, and has attracted the interest of stars such as Andy Murray and Venus Williams. It's a bit like table tennis, but without the table. ""I would love to see us grow not only in the Caribbean but in Europe,"" Barnett says. ""It would be great to see our guys working in schools all over the world, spreading the word."" The recipe is simple. Find a hard flat surface, indoors or outside. Mark out a court 20 x 10 feet (6 x 3 meters) using chalk or preferably tape. Erect a ""net"" -- usually made of plywood -- standing eight inches (20 centimeters) high. The bats are similar to those used in table tennis, but without the rubber. The balls are of the tennis variety but without the fur, and deflated to reduce bounce. The first player to score 21 points wins, with each taking five serves in turn. ""We have a vision to get it in as many countries as possible,"" says Dale Clarke, chief executive of the Professional Road Tennis Association. ""The game is addictive, once you start you always want to play,"" the 35-year-old told CNN. ""We've had requests from Germany, Sweden and America for more information."" When Barnett was asked to go to London to take part in a promotional video with world No. 4 Murray, former world heavyweight boxing champion David Haye and other Bajan Road Tennis stars, he jumped at the chance. Murray beat Haye after a quick run-through of the basics, but went down 21-16 to his Barbadian opponent. ""I took it easy on him!"" Barnett told CNN. ""But seriously, Andy was a great guy and showed a genuine interest in our sport."" Murray, for his part, enjoyed the challenge . ""It's very, very different to tennis, and I quite like that,"" the Briton told CNN. ""The guys are some of the best at that game, so were a whole lot better than me, that's for sure."" According to the official Professional Road Tennis website, the sport was first played in the 1930s in the parish of St Michael. It earned the label ""poor man's tennis"" because pieces of wood, or even even hard-cover books, were used as rackets. In essence, little has changed since, but plywood soon became the popular choice for the bats and the ""skinning"" of the tennis balls became widespread. West Indian cricket legend Brian Lara, who hails from Trinidad, is a notable fan of the sport, while France's Gael Monfils is among the top tennis players who have tried it on visits to Barbados -- which is best known as a tropical paradise for holidaymakers. Barnett has been playing since he was 12, and says he can still compete with the likes of current world champion Julian White because ""experience counts for a lot."" There is prize money at stake for the Caribbean island's 150 active players, but Road Tennis remains semi-professional. Barnett spends a lot of time coaching and spreading the gospel about his sport, but believes its promotion has been lacking. ""Our main challenge is our governing bodies in Barbados take sport too lightly, it's one of the reasons it hasn't reached other Caribbean countries. We have to do better, "" he says.","Road Tennis enthusiasts seeking to spread the sport's appeal beyond Barbados .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration has issued a disaster declaration for the Texas town hit by fertilizer plant blasts in April. The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Friday aid for the area affected by the tragedy in the town of West. Federal funding will supplement state and local recovery efforts ""for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the explosion in McLennan County,"" FEMA said. The April 17 fire led to simultaneous blasts at a fertilizer distribution facility, killing 15 and decimating homes, businesses and more within 37 blocks. This decision came after FEMA in June told Gov. Rick Perry it was denying a request to declare the small town a ""major disaster"" area, a move sharply criticized by local and state officials. The letter from FEMA spokesman Craig Fugate noted Obama had previously issued an emergency declaration and other measures that paved the way for some direct federal assistance. ""Based on our review of all of the information available, it has been determined that the remaining costs for permanent work is within the capabilities of the state and affected local governments,"" Fugate said at the time. ""Accordingly, we have determined that a major disaster declaration is not necessary."" After the Friday announcement, Perry, who slammed the FEMA move two months ago, lauded a successful state appeal of the initial federal move. ""The approval of the state's appeal for a major disaster declaration is great and welcome news for the people of West,"" Perry said. ""I appreciate everyone who joined me in standing with the people whose lives have been forever impacted to move this appeal forward, especially our congressional delegation."" Perry said the federal action and the state legislature's disaster relief funding ""will help this community rebuild their infrastructure, school district and public works as quickly as possible."" A fire at the facility operated by West Fertilizer Company set off two explosions that registered on seismographs as a magnitude-2.1 earthquake and were felt 50 miles away. The blasts leveled a portion of the town, damaging numerous homes, a nursing home and the town's high school and middle school. According to local officials, the city is still well short of the $17 million it needs to repair roads, water and sewage lines and other damaged infrastructure.

"(CNN) -- Talk about a ""smart"" phoneâ€”Japan's latest mobile phone sensation also happens to be a radiation detector. The Pantone 5 107SH is the world's first mobile phone with a built-in radiation sensor, merging phone technology with a pocket Geiger counter, the company says. Softbank spokeswoman Natsuko Kameda says the company's CEO decided to launch the phone after customers sent messages via Twitter asking him to develop the handy product in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Many of the messages, says Kameda, were from mothers with young children. ""This device will allow people to measure radiation everyday, wherever they go. People always have their mobile phones in their pocket,"" Kameda said. ""If you have this radiation reading device in the cell phone, then they can check radiation at any time and it should help lower anxiety."" On first blush, the phone looks so ordinary that it's impossible to tell there's a radiation meter within. Softbank said the meter is small so it doesn't enlarge the device. For that reason, the radiation readings are not as accurate as larger, medical radiation readers and dosimeters. But tests so far show its mobile phone radiation reader rivals current consumer brands on the market, Softbank said. The phone also allows the user to compare radiation readings with radiation maps available on the web. Japan has seen a skyrocketing demand for dosimeters and radiation monitors since the Fukushima disaster. Citizens fearful of radiation spreading through the food chain and the air have been buying meters. Softbank says the phone will be available in mid-June. Softbank is led by CEO Masayoshi Son, a well-known opponent of nuclear power. He has publicly supported solar farms as a replacement for nuclear energy.","A new Japan's mobile phone will include a radiation detector .

"(CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner is facing a huge moment in his career. Now that the Senate has passed the immigration bill, all eyes have turned to the House, where some right-wing members of the GOP are prepared to scuttle the bipartisan deal that has been carefully crafted in the upper chamber. According to Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole, ""We have a minority of the minority in the Senate voting for this bill. That's not going to put a lot of pressure on the majority of the majority in the House."" This is a test for Boehner, a massive opportunity for him to rebuild a languishing speakership. At this point, the verdict of history probably would not be very kind to him. Boehner has struggled to move legislation through his chamber, as the recent embarrassing failure of the farm bill showed. His biggest victories have primarily been symbolic, like the legislation dealing with abortion that has no chance of passing the Senate. If his goal is to bring together the various factions of his party into common accord behind key legislation, he has repeatedly failed. How can Boehner have any success with immigration? After watching the collapse of the deal with farm legislation, it seems difficult to fathom how he can stitch together a majority that will stay on board with this bill. When the bet is between failure and success, most Washington observers would bet on failure. Yet Boehner does have some tools at his disposal. Most importantly, he can work with external organizations to lobby House Republicans, namely, religious and business organizations. Both these groups have shown strong support for immigration reform and they have considerable clout in gerrymandered districts that President Obama can never reach. A large number of religious groups, including evangelical Christians, have called on Congress to pass the reform. Ralph Reed, one of the most influential members of the religious right in recent years and who is the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said: ""As people of faith, this is not just an economic and security issue; it is a moral issue. This bill, while not perfect, is an important starting point to reforming and modernizing U.S. immigration law so it reflects faith-based principles of compassion for the alien, the primacy of the family, respect for the rule of law, and protecting U.S. security and sovereignty."" This strategy has worked before. When Southern Democrats were filibustering the Civil Rights Act of 1964, religious organizations helped the Johnson administration persuade Midwestern Republican senators to vote for cloture. Business groups, traditionally a driving force for immigration liberalization, can also help Boehner. Given their immense clout within the party as well as within specific districts, business groups should flex their financial muscle to pressure members into voting yes. Boehner needs to threaten House Republicans that he could work out a deal with Democrats and moderates in the party. Boehner has generally adopted a model of leadership in which he follows the lead of his caucus. If enough Republicans don't agree with a path to citizenship and believe that passing this legislation will threaten their majority, then he should follow their demands. But another model of congressional leadership is to try to shape his caucus rather than having it shape him. As the Emory political scientist Randall Strahan detailed in his book, ""Leading Representatives,"" there is a history of speakers, such as Henry Clay, Thomas Reed and Newt Gingrich, who have taken enormous risks to push their caucus in new directions. This is a strategy that could produce historic legislation. This is the path that Speaker Tip O'Neill took, to the chagrin of many liberals, when he worked with President Reagan's administration to pass the tax cut of 1981. Rather than standing in the way of the tax cut, O'Neill decided to sign on and demanded goodies for Democratic constituencies. House Democrats, who had little love for Reagan, had little choice but to join their speaker, knowing that they were going to lose. With the case of immigration, Boehner could enter into a dramatic bipartisan alliance that would leave him with much greater national clout. Even the threat of an alliance might be sufficient to move enough conservative House Republicans, who sense that defeat is inevitable and decide that they might as well win some credit for the victory. Finally, there is always the power of pork. When Lyndon Johnson, as Senate majority leader, had to craft a deal over the Civil Rights Act of 1957, one of the tools he used to win over Western senators to vote in ways that were helpful to him was to convince Southerners to support a major water project in Arizona. Today, the tools of pork are not as voluminous. A stringent budget and limits on earmarks have taken away some of the tools that the leadership depends on. Yet there is still pork to go around. While tea party Republicans allegedly don't like this, nothing could be further from the truth. In 2011, an investigation by Newsweek found how, despite their rhetoric, tea party Republicans have made the same kind of demands for money in their districts as others. Virginia's Eric Cantor, House majority leader, for instance, pressed for transportation funding in his home state even while deriding Congress for its spending habits. All these tools offer Boehner some path and muscle to make the impossible possible. If the immigration bill goes down to defeat in the House it would be a huge blow to those desperately seeking a path to citizenship, to the national standing of the GOP and to Boehner. His power as a legislative leader would totally vanish, and other than tea party Republicans, there would be little support for him. All speakers face historic turning points, and immigration is Boehner's. The outcome of the debates will overshadow all the budget wars and everything that follows. Whether the speaker is up to meeting this challenge remains to be seen in the coming weeks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: All eyes have turned to the House to see if immigration bill will pass .

"Washington (CNN) -- The fragile U.S.-Russia relationship -- already frayed by disagreements over Syria, Iran and nuclear arms -- showed another sign of strain Sunday, as American lawmakers blasted the country's President Vladimir Putin for allowing NSA leaker Edward Snowden to land in Moscow while evading U.S. espionage charges. Snowden, who has admitted leaking top-secret information about government surveillance programs, left Hong Kong on Sunday and later touched down in Moscow, according to Wikileaks, which helped him travel. While Russia is not believed to be his final destination -- Ecuador's prime minister said Snowden applied for asylum in his country -- lawmakers on Sunday were quick to fault Putin for harboring a man the U.S. government desperately wants back. ""Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States, whether it is Syria, Iran, and now, of course, with Snowden,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer said on CNN's State of the Union. ""That's not how allies should treat one another, and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship."" That relationship was already showing signs of strain at last week's Group of Eight conference in Northern Ireland, where global leaders pressured Putin on his country's support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which extends back to the Cold War and Assad's father. At a joint appearance that followed a bilateral meeting last week, Putin and President Barack Obama were tense and unsmiling and offered no indication their deep disagreements about the way forward in war-torn Syria were any closer to being resolved. Why would Snowden head for Ecuador? Later in the week, Obama publicly pressured Russia to join the United States in slashing its supply of nuclear weapons, saying both nations needed to ""move beyond Cold War nuclear postures."" Obama delivered his remarks at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, which for decades symbolized the East-West divide. On Sunday, however, the divide between the United States and Russia persisted. Schumer, a New York Democrat, suggested on CNN that Putin personally approved Snowden's landing in Moscow on Sunday. ""Very few are the areas in which he does cooperate (with the U.S.) these days. I think this action, Putin allowing Snowden to land in Russia and then go somewhere else, is going to have serious consequences for the U.S.-Russian relationship,"" Schumer said. His characterization of Russia's stance was echoed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, an infrequent ally of Schumer's, who spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I hope we'll chase him to the ends of the earth, bring him to justice and let the Russians know there will be consequences if they harbor this guy,"" said Graham, who represents South Carolina. ""They want to be part of the world community, the (World Trade Organization). They want a good relationship with the United States. They should hold this felon and send him back home for justice,"" Graham said. Russia joined the World Trade Organization last August after nearly two decades of negotiations. Before being admitted, it was the largest economy not represented at the global trade body. As lawmakers spoke Sunday, it remained unclear where Snowden's final destination would be, though he was not expected to remain in Russia. Snowden's U.S. passport has been revoked, according to a source familiar with the matter, setting up any travel out of Russia to become a major diplomatic flashpoint. ""Persons wanted on felony charges, such as Mr. Snowden, should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States,"" State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. Earlier in June, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would consider a request for political asylum from Snowden, but that such a request from the NSA leaker had not yet been made. Peskov, in an indication of the Kremlin's stance, also wrote on Twitter, ""The U.S. security services were breaking the laws of their country by tapping phone calls and conducting Internet surveillance."" Wikileaks' Assange urges support for Snowden, slams Obama . ""Snowden, same as Assange, is a human rights activist,"" he continued, referring to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, currently holed up at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he's been granted asylum. Asked Sunday whether he believed Putin had advance knowledge of Snowden's travel plans, Rep. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, ""That wouldn't surprise me."" ""Russia is a country that wants to get back on the world stage, and I don't think they really care if they do it in a way that's in the best interest of good citizenship around the world,"" Rogers said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" citing Putin's stance on Syria and nuclear disarmament. ""I'm sure they would love to have a little coffee and a few conversations with Mr. Snowden,"" continued the Michigan Republican, referring to the Russians. ""That's why this is so serious and why we need to be so aggressive in making sure that people understand the difference between somebody who betrays their country and gives secrets away that will protect American lives at the expense of whatever he hopes to gain in the company of the Russians."" Rogers' remarks underscored the debate between those who believe Snowden committed an act of treason and those who view him as a hero promoting greater government transparency. The debate has created unlikely alliances in Washington, where some Democrats find themselves on the same side as Republicans -- and opposite their base -- in calling for Snowden's arrest. An empty debate? Why little will happen to change how we snoop . Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, was loudly booed and heckled at a conference of progressives Saturday when she asserted Snowden had broken the law. Earlier, she drew a distinction between lawmakers like herself, who oversee the nation's security, and privacy-minded citizens. ""I know that some of you attribute heroic status to that action,"" she said, referring to Snowden's leaks. ""But, again, you don't have the responsibility for the security of the United States. Those of us who do have to strike a different balance."" ""I don't think this man is a whistle-blower,"" another California Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""Whatever his motives are, and I take him at face value, he could have stayed and faced the music. I don't think running is a noble thought."" That view was countered by Sen. Rand Paul, a libertarian-minded Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few U.S. lawmakers to praise Snowden. While he warned Snowden would be discredited if he ""cozies up to the Russian government,"" Paul suggested the former CIA employee had lived up to his duty as a citizen by exposing what he felt were government misdeeds. ""I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn't lied to anyone. He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution,"" Paul said on CNN, adding: ""He was simply coming forward and telling the truth -- that your government was lying.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- At least 20 homes in Atlanta's historic Cabbagetown neighborhood were flattened by a tornado that ripped through downtown Atlanta on Friday night, a spokeswoman for the mayor said. Debris from Friday night's tornado litters the street outside CNN Center. Firefighters fear there could be people dead inside the ruins of a collapsed loft complex in the same neighborhood, the spokeswoman said. There have been no deaths confirmed from the tornado, but at least 15 people were treated at two hospitals. Most of the injuries were minor cuts, scrapes and bruises, officials said. The Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts, just east of downtown Atlanta, collapsed in a ""pancake fashion,"" Atlanta Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran said early Saturday. The tornado that ripped through the heart of the  city damaged the roof of the Georgia Dome during a college basketball game, shattered windows and ripped roofs from buildings before continuing into several residential neighborhoods. The building that houses CNN was at the epicenter of the storm -- sitting next to the dome and hotels where thousands of basketball fans attending the Southeastern Conference tournament were at least temporarily displaced.  Watch coverage of damage to CNN Center » . ""It was actually in overtime, and the game was getting exciting, and I thought people from the Alabama side were hitting the bleachers trying to get some noise going,"" said Lucas Shields, who was attending the game between Mississippi State and the University of Alabama. ""All of a sudden the TV went out, the overhead clock stopped working, and you hear that distinctive noise of a train."" Timothy Wood, 30, of Cumming, Georgia, took refuge from rain at Philips Arena. ""First thing I saw were cups then I saw larger objects -- like parts of Philips Arena were coming off and being blown into the street,"" Wood said. Police closed several streets in the vicinity of CNN Center because of glass and other debris from the storm.  Audio Slideshow: View the damage » . The storm tracked from the northwest side of the city to the southeast, demolishing buildings and downing trees that crushed cars and ripped through the roofs of homes. At the Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts, damage was extensive. Mahsud Olufani, an Atlanta painter and sculptor with a studio in one of the other buildings, said he rushed to his studio when he saw news of the damage. ""It looks like a bomb went off, it looks like World War III,"" he said. ""It's a disaster area."" The converted lofts also were the site of a massive 1999 fire, during which a dramatic helicopter rescue was televised worldwide. In the neighborhood of East Atlanta, resident Cameron Beasley said he could see four or five homes with storm damage, including trees knocked through their roofs, and several cars crushed by downed trees. ""Something really fierce came down,"" said Beasley, who said he and his wife ran with their two children into their basement about 15 seconds before the storm hit. ""It was just crushing cars, crushing houses."" The National Weather Service had issued a tornado warning for the area, in effect until 10 p.m. The storm came through at about 9:45 p.m. Inside CNN Center, water poured through damage in the ceiling into the building's atrium. Glass shattered, and parts of the building filled with dust. Virtually all of the windows facing Centennial Olympic Park on the Omni Hotel, which is attached to CNN Center, were shattered, leaving curtains flapping in the darkened windows. Visitors to the hotel were evacuated to the facility's exhibition hall at street level.  Watch survey of damage to Omni Hotel » . Windows also were shattered in the CNN.com newsroom, with staffers saying that there was a computer missing -- apparently sucked through one of the windows. CNN's library was also damaged.  See photos of the damage inside » . Outside the building, debris littered the streets and billboards collapsed onto parked cars. Centennial Olympic Park was also severely damaged. Next door at the Georgia Dome, the Alabama-Mississippi State game was halted. The storm visibly rippled the ceiling of the dome and caused some damage, video of the arena showed. Scaffolding holding the facility's scoreboard swayed 15 minutes after the storm hit. The game resumed about an hour later, but a later game between Kentucky and Georgia was postponed. Joe Bryson, 28, of Cumming, Georgia, was outside when the winds hit. ""When it started to drizzle a little bit, everyone got under some shelter, watching things develop. It started to pick up a bit. When the metal barriers fell over and started skidding along the ground that's when everyone started -- not panicking -- but going inside. ""I saw two fellas who were running to come to shelter and they were getting pushed from the back [by the wind]. They got knocked down but got right back up and followed everyone inside,"" Bryson said. Catherine Niehaus, an iReporter, was inside the Georgia Dome when she said the roof split, scaffolding slipped and the scoreboard started to sway. Slabs of metal and insulation material smothered the streets outside. Cars and emergency vehicles were scattered among the debris as hundreds of people, many of them attending the Southeastern Conference basketball tournament, wandered around talking on cell phones. Heaps of bricks and sheetrock were pushed up against cars. Streets signs were bent in half. At the neighboring Georgia World Congress Center, the storm blew down a wall, allowing water to pool ankle deep inside the building. Further east, heavy damage was reported near Grady Memorial Hospital. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the most recent downtown tornado in the United States hit Jacksonville, Florida, August 12, 2004. There were no deaths. According to the NOAA, the deadliest tornado to hit a downtown area in the 20th century was May 11, 1953, when 114 people were killed in Waco, Texas. Although downtown tornadoes are rare, it's a misconception they can't happen, according to The Tornado Project, a company that gathers and compiles tornado information. ""That more 'cities' aren't struck by tornadoes is probably more coincidence than anything else,"" according to the project's Web site. ""There are very few 'big cities' with skyscrapers in Tornado Alley. In fact, there are only a dozen, and one of them, St. Louis, Missouri, has a long history of tornadoes in its central area.""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The trial of an Iraqi journalist charged with throwing his shoes at U.S. President George Bush has been postponed, Iraq's Council of Ministers and one of the journalist's lawyers said Tuesday. Amman protesters support Muntazer al-Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist held for throwing his shoes at President Bush. Muntadhir Al-Zaidi was due to go on trial Wednesday, but the Criminal Court postponed it pending an appeal filed by his lawyers with the Federal Court of Appeal, a spokesman for the Supreme Judicial Council, Abdul Sattar Bayrakdar, said. Dhiya al-Saadi, who leads Al-Zaidi's 25-member legal team, confirmed the postponement. Al-Zaidi threw both of his shoes at Bush two weeks ago during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad. Neither shoe hit the president, and others in the room quickly knocked Al-Zaidi to the ground before security officials arrested him. Many Iraqis hail Al-Zaidi, who faces a prison term if convicted, as a hero. More than 1,000 lawyers have volunteered to defend him, al-Saadi said. The lawyers' appeal asked the Federal Court to change Al-Zaidi's case from assaulting Bush to insulting him. If Al-Zaidi is convicted of the former, he faces a maximum of 15 years in prison, al-Saadi said. The lawyers are trying to persuade the appeals court that Al-Zaidi did not want to harm Bush by throwing the shoes, but simply wanted to insult him. By tradition, throwing a shoe is the most insulting act in the Arab world. Al-Saadi said he met with his client several days ago but was having difficulty meeting with him again. He did not give the reason he was not allowed to see Al-Zaidi but said many lawyers have trouble meeting with detainees in Iraqi or U.S. custody. It will take at least two weeks for the court to set a new date for Al-Zaidi's trial, legal expert Tariz Harab said. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Trial of Iraqi journalist who threw shoes at U.S. President Bush delayed .

"I'm often asked how I got started on my weight loss journey. I wish I had a simple, perky answer, but the truth is, I had a lot of internal housecleaning to do first. Lynn Bering eats a mostly vegetarian diet and exercises five days a week to maintain her 168-pound weight loss. I had so many feelings floating around in my head when I weighed 300 pounds -- inadequacy, anger, and overall helplessness. I vacillated for months between accepting my body as it was and choosing to lose weight. I journaled tough questions: How did I feel about my body? How much did I love myself? Was I worth changing for? It was difficult and often uncomfortable work, I won't lie, but once I was honest with myself and became better acquainted with the emotions that bothered me most, I was ready to lose weight. Working through those issues, or at least confronting them, left me better prepared for the ""tough love"" it took to discipline that weak voice inside that said, ""This is hard. I want chocolate (or fries or animal crackers or any other simple carb you can imagine). Feed me."" I learned to say no to myself and I committed to learning new behaviors that helped me change ""I can't"" to ""I will."" I still write down everything I eat. I still ask myself, ""How will I feel five minutes after I eat this?"" If the answer is anything other than, ""I will feel good having made this food choice,"" then I don't eat it. Or at least most of the time I don't. Sometimes that whiny voice wins. But the point is, I think about it. Am I eating because I want to or because I need to? Am I feeding some emotion I'm afraid to examine? I can't sugar-coat the truth. I can't even use Splenda to make it easier. Losing weight means changing everything -- how you think about food and how you think about yourself. But if you don't take shortcuts and you find your inner strength (and we all have that within ourselves), you'll be rewarded with not only more energy and better health, you'll be your own best friend.  Bering tracks her progress, fitness regimens and the pitfalls of losing weight on her blog, Lynn's Weight Loss Journey.  E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Dear baby boomer parents, . It's time to talk. After people my age were done growing our hair long, wearing our bell bottoms and protesting the Vietnam War, we got jobs, mortgages, high cholesterol and bunions. Many of us also educated children -- often at colleges that would never have admitted us -- and groomed our kids to expect and accept only the best, never dreaming that they'd graduate into an economy that would crush even some of the brightest. Plenty of our children have gotten the short straw. Some 53% of people younger than 25 are unemployed or underemployed. Many have been crippled by indecision, picking a direction, reversing it, spinning the dial again, and flying two stars to the right, straight on till morning before they return to live with us again. There is more, however, to their generational wandering and inertia than pure economics. Boomers' fury at the very idea that we have to age sends a subliminal message that there will always be time for our kids to get another degree or to surf another couch, to break up with one more partner or employer, and to wait around to reproduce, while ignoring the reality that opportunities will evaporate. Opinion: Facebook parenting is destroying our children's privacy . If parents aren't old -- and who among us doesn't feel 35? -- then for adultescents, the years must be standing still. If we're not old, with our titanium joints and botox, how can we expect our kids to grow up? If we're not old, our offspring, whose complete childhoods we archive in our hearts with four-color illustrations and footnotes, must remain big babies. Boomers have established the 2.0 model for self-involvement, enhanced by boasting about our most prized assets, our kids, whose attention we crave, and who all too often exist on a broad plain of entitlement that we've hired gardeners to maintain if we're not hoeing and mowing ourselves. In this devil of a job market, many young adults now exist in a cloud of overconfidence with an illusion of endless time. Parenthood requires constant renegotiation, which is where boomers often bomb. We remain overinvolved in adultescents' lives, another twist on not wanting to get old. It's painful for us to recognize that biology's imperative is for youngsters to manage without parents, and that many life lessons must be learned alone. We can't teach kids how to learn to meet deadlines, get along with people and deal with rejection. These are solo projects. Opinion: Kid, you are not special . On the motherhood spectrum, I've always felt laid-back. After my two sons got college diplomas, each one moved to the opposite coast. Roots and wings, I thought. That's the ticket. But as a son became engaged to marry, I felt an unfamiliar panic. I realized it came from wondering if I'd done enough to prep my child for the rest of life. Did he have a full tool kit to evolve into the world's most caring, contended man? Had I done my job to see that he was? CNN Profiles: Michael Thompson on raising independent children . Tough nuts if he wasn't, because the statute of limitations on micromanaging that process was running out. Was I ready to let go? No. But I'm trying. I worry deeply about peers who won't cop to this new job description, although I recognize that it's harder for parents to let go if adultescents lead lives that appear much the same as 10 years ago, possibly even sleeping in their old bed. Nonetheless, it's up to us to allow adult children to determine their fates. Opinion: Non, the French are not better moms . Once kids graduate from college, it's time to collectively peel off the bumper stickers and remind ourselves the ultimate goal as parents is to stop trying to vaccinate our children against every conceivable catastrophe. The best and most lasting gift we can offer our children is the chance to develop independence so that one day they can teach their own kids to do the same. This means boomers acting like tough coaches, not fairy godparents with an indefatigable ability to solve problems and limitless credit cards: 59% of people 18 to 39 who are not students receive some financial aid from parents. Mothers and fathers should start early, or at least earlier, to give kids a crash course in the DIY drudgery -- from tax prep to turkey trussing -- that doesn't make it onto school applications and resumes. These are the tasks our country undervalues. And when young adults return to live at home, we need to establish rules as well as time frames for how long stays will last, along with encouraging kids to expand job searches and perhaps take any position until dream jobs come along. Parents need to step back for adult children to step forward. With the time we gain by not being a concierge to kids' lives, we can address the brain drain and social tragedy resulting from countless well-educated young adults lingering jobless, especially those who graduated in the dog years of 2007 and 2008. These adultescents aren't damaged goods. They just look that way to employers, who when they do have a job to fill, prefer a more freshly graduated model. Forcing ourselves to back off is no harder than what we expect of our children, whose journeys, I hope, lead them on a path to lasting fulfillment and calling home, often, so that both generations can say ""I love you."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Koslow.","Sally Koslow: Boomers resist aging; message to kids: you've got plenty of time to grow up .
She says lots of kids face a terrible job market; parents can't blunt that, should let kids deal .

"Rome (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners gathered in southern Italy on Tuesday for the funeral of 38 people killed when their bus plunged off a bridge as it returned from a visit to a Catholic shrine. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta was among those who attended the service in the village of Pozzuoli, near Naples. He said on Twitter that Tuesday would be a national day of mourning for the victims. An estimated 5,000 people turned out for the funeral, held in a sports arena, a spokeswoman for the Naples police said. The bus was traveling east of Naples in Avellino province when it crashed late Sunday. The passengers had participated in a weekend pilgrimage to the Padre Pio shrine in Pietrelcina. Rosario Cantelmo, the Avellino prosecutor who is coordinating the investigation, told CNN that the bus driver -- who was among those killed -- is the focus of inquiries. An autopsy on the driver's body should be completed in the coming days, Cantelmo said. Andrea Regione, a photographer for the Corriere dell'Irpinia newspaper, told CNN that the bus went off a bridge and fell roughly 30 meters (almost 100 feet) into a heavily wooded area below. Photos from the scene showed a broken guardrail and the bus lying on its side. Avellino police official Pasquale Picone said the bus struck 11 cars on the road before falling off the bridge, leading police to suspect the bus had brake problems. But the exact cause of the accident remains unknown. The funeral in Pozzuoli comes only a day after a somber memorial Mass in Spain for 79 victims of last week's train crash outside Santiago de Compostela. Journalist Barbie Latza Nadeau contributed to this report.","NEW: Investigations are focused on the bus driver, the chief prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi's top prosecutor Wednesday threatened to subpoena the search giant Google over what he called its failure to crack down on ads touting unlawful sales of prescription drugs and pirated entertainment. Attorney General Jim Hood said that he and several other state prosecutors have called for Google to tighten its restrictions on advertising those products and that the company hasn't responded. ""Google's lack of response leaves us no choice except to issue subpoenas to Google for possible violations of state consumer protection acts and other state and federal civil and criminal laws,"" Hood said in a written statement. ""We attorneys general are duty-bound to enforce our consumer protection laws and other civil and criminal statutes. Google is aiding and abetting criminal activity and putting consumers at risk."" The company paid a $500 million civil fine in 2012 over what federal regulators said were unlawful sales of prescription drugs over the Internet. The Justice Department said Google was on notice as early as 2003 that online pharmacies were advertising prescription drugs online to users in the United States but failed to prevent the practice. The Mountain View, California-based company said Wednesday it has made things ""increasingly difficult"" for illegal pharmacies to hawk their products using its search engine. ""A variety of websites and web services are refusing ads from suspected rogue pharmacies,"" it said. ""Domain name registrars are removing suspect rogue pharmacies from their networks. Payment processors are blocking payments to these operators, and social networking sites are removing them from their systems too."" But it added that its results ""reflect the web and what's online -- the good and the bad."" ""Filtering a website from search results won't remove it from the web, or block other websites that link to that website,"" it said in a statement posted on its public policy blog. ""It's not Google's place to determine what content should be censored -- that responsibility belongs with the courts and the lawmakers.""","Prosecutor: Google should crack down on ads touting unlawful prescription drugs .

"(CNN) -- Former Major League Baseball pitcher Frank Castillo drowned while swimming in a lake near Phoenix, Arizona, authorities said Monday. He was 44.

"(CNN) -- A new smartphone operating system is joining the fray. Mozilla released a phone running its new Firefox OS in Spain on Monday, joining leading mobile operating systems Android and iOS, as well as smaller players Windows Phone and Blackberry. The ZTE Open and Alcatel OneTouch Fire are very basic phones with 3.5-inch screens, entry-level specs and appealingly low price tags. Telefonica will sell the ZTE Open in Spain starting July 2 for 69 euros, or about $90. Nonprofit company Mozilla is trying to shake up the typical closed app ecosystems with the Firefox OS. Built using open Web standards, it will appeal to the estimated 8 million Web developers who can jump right in and start creating HTML 5 apps for the phones. There is no timeline for when the phone will come to the United States. For now, Mozilla is focusing on emerging markets such as Spain, Poland, Colombia, Venezuela and eventually Brazil, where an iPhone is prohibitively expensive for most people. ""For many of the users, this will be the first smartphone they would purchase,"" said Chris Lee, who heads the product team for Firefox OS. Firefox OS is rolling out in locations where significant portions of the population are still using feature phones. Multiyear service contracts that can cut the cost of a smartphone aren't as common, and expensive high-end handsets such as the iPhone or Galaxy S-series are out of reach. Cheap Android devices are available, but at an event in San Francisco announcing the release, Mozilla CTO Brendan Eich pointed out that most of those are running Gingerbread, an old version of the Android OS. Eich also said the company was realistic about its goals. ""We are not aiming high and crashing into fortress Apple and fortress Google,"" said Eich. Design-wise, the Firefox OS keeps it incredibly simple and intuitive to appeal to new smartphone users. The current home screen is most similar to the iPhone, with a four-by-four grid of icons and a dock for the most-used apps along the bottom of the screen. Lee says this version is just a starting point. The company hopes developers will create custom interfaces for the devices that mimic what people love about Android or Windows Phone or even entirely new takes on the usual smartphone screens. Firefox OS already has a few of the most popular apps, including Twitter and Facebook, as well as a maps app powered by Nokia Here. The usual built-in phone features are included for making phone calls, texting and browsing the Web. New HTML 5 apps will be available in the Mozilla Marketplace after they're screened for security, though Mozilla won't be kicking apps out for content. The first Firefox OS phones are practical, not flashy, but the company hopes the combination of low price and open ecosystem will make it a moderate hit. ""Consumers don't really know or care too much about what's under the hood,"" said Eich. ""They want something that has a brand they trust ... a good price and something that satisfies them about the apps. That's a pretty short checklist.""","Mozilla's new Firefox mobile operating system rolls out in Europe .
